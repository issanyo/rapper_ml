(Intro)
Yeah, yeah, yeah new mixtape uh huh let's go! Let's go!

(Verse 1)
I'm tired of the struggle and it never goes away (nope)
I'm tired of the hustle I can't even keep my pay (nope)
Spending up my money on things that come my way (way)
Helping paying bills, man my struggle isn't fake (fake)
I got God on my mind and Jesus in my heart (yeah)
Everything is possible and there should be no spark (nope)
The devil keep tempting me and now I'm at the start (yup)
I stay up in the past and these figures go down the charts (charts)
Everyday I get up,  (up)
I start off with a smile (smile)
I wanna turn up (up)
But at school I work out
On SoundTrap, man that studio is that (yeah)
This is all I can afford right now, hope Kevin got my back (Clark)
You used to be that kid that has extraordinary dreams (dreams)
Now your facing real life and those imaginations beams (beams)
God is on your side and this is all that come up and brings (brings)
I was born in the F and you know that's what I mean

(Chorus)
I struggle err-day, you know the struggles real hard (real hard)
I like to get paid, but my hours cut back far (far)
At the Hut I was a slave, they played me like some cars (vrooom)
But without God I've wouldn't have made it this far (nope)
The struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle
Man I'm getting tired, man I hate the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle
Man I'm getting tired, man I hate the struggle

(Verse 2)
I moved from door to door
And moved out of house to house (what)
In middle of the trap
Now in a hotel living it out (yeah)
Living with family members that loved me no doubt (true)
Now they all arguing about who's moving out (yup)
Almost 18, damn I'll be a man (yup)
Working for Channel 8
Copping me some bandz (hey)
It's not all about the money
It's about relationship and friends (hey)
I love the Way with all my heart
But they like things in advanced (uh huh)
My momma and my Titi
Always taking it out (yup)
They tell me, LT, Tyrece and Darius
To work it out (why)
What's the point doing something your not even about (about)
We see you fighting all time like bears and trout (fish)
My daddy always talking wreckless, but he still down south (what)
Haven't seen him in years and he runs his mouth
It's been 17 years, where's my father? He's bound (yeah)
I don't care I'll meet when he's out


(Chorus)
I struggle err-day, you know the struggles real hard (real hard)
I like to get paid, but my hours cut back far (far)
At the Hut I was a slave, they played me like some cars (vrooom)
But without God I've wouldn't have made it this far (nope)
The struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle
Man I'm getting tired, man I hate the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle
Man I'm getting tired, man I hate the struggle
