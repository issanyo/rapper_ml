[Intro: Meek Mill]
I just wanna ask one question
Do all the fame and money and bitches
Was the love real?
Was you real?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah
And we was tought to hate our own kind
And you can hate on me homie
You picked the wrong time
Cause this a long line
And lately I been all griding
If nobody wanna work
Imma do it all fine
But when the money all mine
I know they gone cross sides
Cause niggas they be jumping sides
I just call it all sides with all odds
And all odds against me
Imma chase my dreams and I won't let my pride convince me
Throwing all a weak and cause I was trying to be too friendly
Be loyal to niggas that never did nothing for me
Okay to me to this pain all this rain I walk through
And I remain still the same but It's my fault too
Cause I show niggas the light when it was dark too
Which mean I let them skip the beginning and I start new
Just like I did
And they say if you ain't earn it you gone probably burn it
And I seen niggas take the money over how you learn it
And you can't teach nobody nothing if they ain't tryna learn it
If it wasn't fucking bitches rollin' up tryna burn it
We could have did that in the trap, it been all that
Since niggas love the hood so much I let them fall back
I used to book the jet and yet all my dogs at
But since nobody want the money I take all that

[Verse 2: HARDO]
Tryna rise above poverty
That's why I'm trapping
If I dont' make it out the hood
I know it's going to happen
Keep that desert eagle
They might try me cause I'm rapping
I ain't talking about no pringles
All these chips these niggas stacking
Same stepping stones that make it out
Iâ€™m throwing at the jail
You really gotta focus
If you hoping to prevail
Cuttin' loved ones off to get it
Goddamn it never fails
Tryna ride nigga wave
Man this shit don't ever sail
When I'm only just relating
To the shit I only seen
This ain't entertainment man
I'm really who I seem
Dark cloud around my city
I'm the winter rearrange
Saw ? brainstorming
I'm just hoping it never rains
Man they wonder why ??
My folks getting wipped
And they went shackled down in chains
And I better bring that billion
To Martin Luther King
Why these niggas chasing bitches
Man I'm out here chasing dreams
And I only fuck with niggas
That are always gone strive
Any day I pass
They keep my legacy alive
Used to drop it in a pot
And I watch it multiply
Used to give the smokers wake up
Just to watch em come alive
Man I started in a project
Twenty bucks attendant
So rim and them was free
Still ain't ?
Now if that ain't the bottom
At the top I finish
Trap illustrated
This the beginning, huh!

[Bridge: HARDO]
PH stand up
41215 nigga
Meek Milli ? Hardo, bitch
Get your motherfucking money nigga

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Fuck you!
See, one thing about me
Go look at my instagram since the last 3 years
And you see me ballin' out with all of my niggas
And if you start seeing niggas missing out the picture
That just mean they ain't doing their job
