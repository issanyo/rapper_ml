[Intro: Meek Mill]
You know the kid, you know my name
Superman up in the booth, shawty Lois Lane
You know the game, blowing change like I grow it mane
I been the hottest in my city way before the fame
Hold up, let me turn up
Hit chicks like Tina Turner
Work shit like Jackie Turner
She give head, that's how you learn her
Boy I'm jumping out that coupe nigga
Getting money, salute nigga
You don't do what I do nigga
Two chains, that's TRU nigga

[Verse 1: Kayla Brianna]
I'ma take the lead boy
Hold up baby, let me get you up to speed boy
I'ma have you on your knees boy
You gon' run and tell your mama 'bout me boy

[Bridge: Kayla Brianna]
Ooh, boy I see you watching me
Got your eyes on me but tell me can you follow me?
Boy I see you watching me
Got your eyes on me but tell me can you follow me?

[Hook: Kayla Brianna & Meek Mill]
Given what you say to me is what you do to me
Show me baby if it’s really real
You'd better watch just what you say to me
Watch what you do to me
Flip it on you, show you how it feels
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that

[Verse 2: Kayla Brianna]
I’ma let my hair down baby
Yeah you know you see it
Clean and proper when I step out on the scene
I’ma hit the dance floor baby
Oh I'ma have you so addicted
Run the show and shake it like a tambourine

[Bridge: Kayla Brianna]
Ooh, boy I see you watching me
Got your eyes on me but tell me can you follow me?
Boy I see you watching me
Got your eyes on me but tell me can you follow me?

[Hook: Kayla Brianna & Meek Mill]
Given what you say to me is what you do to me
Show me baby if it’s really real
You'd better watch just what you say to me
Watch what you do to me
Flip it on you, show you how it feels
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Okay I’m balling like the Heat
Thousand dollar sneaks
Lou Vuitton spikes on them like a pair of cleats
I don't check for hoes, let 'em check for me
In this black and white Ferrari, blow the whistle referee
Time's out cause I ball though, suicide door flow
Got these hoes checking for me, you can call me Waldo
Probably in the car lot, bossin' like [?]
Cause every time I’ll pull up on you niggas it’s a car show

[Hook: Kayla Brianna & Meek Mill]
Given what you say to me is what you do to me
Show me baby if it’s really real
You'd better watch just what you say to me
Watch what you do to me
Flip it on you, show you how it feels
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that
I got that, I got that, I got that

[Outro: Kayla Brianna]
When I drop it down, turn around, pick it back up
Y'all be lookin' at me sayin', "Kayla, that’s enough"
When I drop it down, turn around, pick it back up
Y'all be lookin' at me sayin', "Kayla, that’s enough"
