[Intro]
Ah, yeah
Used to want a rollie, rollie, rollie with a dab of ranch
So I put that Pyrex n my hood and made a avalanche
Gang

[Verse 1]
Rollie, rollie, bust down, niggas can't hold me (Bust down)
Sip 19' 'till I OD (OD)
Feeling like Julio own me (Own me)
Chillin', just me and my woadies (Gang)
Fuck on the law, we brodies (Skrt skrt)
Lambo clean, we dirty, skrt off
Judge might give me thirty, take off
Pullin' thru to scoop that thot
Smash that hoe out the radar (Radar)
Boy,you too too hot
Niggas sendin' shots, they missed, they way off (Brr)
Told me it wasn't my time, Patek-Phillipe, I Ball, no play-offs
Niggas can't stop my grind, I put in all of the work 'till it pay off

[Bridge]
Ain't no chill (Chill)
Niggas can't shut me up (Shut up)
Big B's on my wheels (Skrrt)
I just levelled up (Level)

She gon' let me fuck (Hit it)
I'm a Navy Seal, I get that hoe touched

[Chorus]
That's your hoe, for me, she go in all the way
I know, 'cause that hoe just a  call away
Went to jail with some bracelets the other day
Got her stored in my phone under cartier
Cartier, let her level up the boss for a day
Out in Miami, we gon' ball, D-Wade
Let her level up the boss for a day
Out in Miami, we gon' ball, D-Wade
Let her level up the boss for a day

[Verse 2]

Scoop that bitch out her panties
Pull out the wraith to the mansion
[??]
Fakers, fakers, fakers, fakers
21, plat that [??]
21, 21, 21 , hunnids on hunnids
It look like like a sandwich
I turn the bitch into a
