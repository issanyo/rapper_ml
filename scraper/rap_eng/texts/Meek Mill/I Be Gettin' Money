[Hook: Meek Mill](x2)
I be getting money I be getting money
I be getting money I be
Is you niggas hating cause you mad or is you mad because you hating
If you getting to the money nigga check the situation

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Dollar after dollar
Hour after hour
Getting to the money ain't even take a shower
Cause this that dirty paper
I know you heard me paper
That flying birdy paper
Make your ho get dirty player
Mortgage on my feet car note on my belt
Your statements on my wrist I am something else
Just check out my bitch Teddy Roosevelt
Cause she a dime make a hater want to murk themselves
I be getting money I be getting money
Niggas looking hungry trying to take it from me
And you gon' catch some shit like you fucked a bitch raw dog
Come up on my [?] shoot it like a boss [?]
All out niggas say hello to my little friend
I hang out with Benjamin me and him be killing them
If I get your girly bet she tour me like a cinnamon
I be getting money, gangsta and a gentleman

[Hook: Meek Mill](x2)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Hating cause you mad or mad because you hating
Its like I'm obligated haters I dominate them
Just pay attention now and leave your comment later
We get them numbers on the low like a denominator
Gold prezi looking like a magnum
Niggas say the fuck my bitches but I let them have them
Laughing cause I ain't comparing I just sharing
I be looking paparazzi the way my diamonds glaring
And I so fly that I be leering
Maserati I be steering
Riding by them haters staring
Wishing I was [?]
Knowing that they want to be me
Every time they see me, I be on the TV
Clarity be VVS and I the freshest
And my jewelry look fluorescent
And if you see a rapper diss me its just like you watching wrestling
Cause they be faker than a motherfucker
Fraud like a credit scam
If you want to book me its 10,000 plus a rubber band

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
The real get realer
The lame get lamer
Shizz and Meek Milly baby its got to be a Flamer!
Lions and gorillas well baby I'mma tame her
Keep a strap on my whip that's my banger
My attitude is middle finger
I'm here now let my smell linger
I can rap and [?] singer
Is you hating cause you mad is you mad cause you hating
Got a couple years in the air talking about dating
They think that I don't know though
Them hoes fuck with them bros though
They be hating all on the low low
Want [?] off my polo
So rest in peace A.G. man
