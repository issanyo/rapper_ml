My lyrics are hiding sum, i can't cook can't even make simple crumpets, joined band and tried to play the trumpet, just like the test i flunked it, always wear black they think that im emo, but their the ones that went straight down to zero, round here everyone calls me a hero, she calls me G but im broke, in our minds these dark thoughts soak, im payin in the house then some glass broke, parents come home then we started getting choked, last night i awoke from the cloak getting soaked in oak, leave you like gunsmoke, sneeze like achoo opps i got the flu, feeling sick needing medicine, i got some credits in represents in school, im the one that rule, leavn all you fools with some drool hangin down yo chin im the king my rap is attached like strings, your puny so ill hit you, and youll go away with a fling, cookn food in the microwave waitn for a ding, above my head, i need to hit the tread, people sleepin on me, so imma just go to bed, my parents keep me well feed, talk wrong and youll be filled with lead, im trapped in a cage in a cave full of bats with some traps in my mind i despise that the way that the flies fly around my eyes lookn for some lies (messed up in this end so im not gonna put the lyrics.)
