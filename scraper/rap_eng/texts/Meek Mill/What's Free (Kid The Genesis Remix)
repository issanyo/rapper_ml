(Verse 1)
I used to rob corner stores
For some fucking money
See the end of day
So my niggas won't be stuning
Elevated so much that you can not even see me
Only time you’ll see me is when I am on the TV

Lawd
I got this game in my pocket
Don't be scared you can watch it
I propane when I'm noxious
I know pain so I mocked it
I don’t give fucks bout yo options

Good Lord saved me from falling
Stick to gun when i'm walking
.48 rounds and it's calling
Death to my name while I'm talking
Bitch on my lane and she yawning

So
What's the point of being free when I ain't
I can't even walk home and not get
Started by the police
Ya'll niggas have a good day
See you around in a week
Free Meek
That nigga ain’t slave to the piece

Free the oppositon keep my brother alive
If you niggas fuck with us
Introduce you to my friend I
Kept that gun inside my bag
Since I was like 14
Now i’m much older
Multiply the guns
By years

Hope you're motherfucking good at math
Cause niggas ain’t playing when it comes to cash
Cream get the money but so does the drug dealer too
Stay in your lane don't snitch
And don't be acting a fool too

I know when you're watching
I can tell you do
Too much shit up in the projects
Swear I’m made in hood

Never ever tried to deal with no consequences
Cause only time I cross the fence
Is when I am so defenseless

Tried to fight you like a hundred million times
Throw that badge
Come at me lil boy
Swing at me I
Won't hesetate to put you on ground
Ground you like your daddy
Now you're mad
That's why you a cop
Nigga you know how it's goind down

Fuck around and get your ass whooped by the finest
Can't throw them hands reason you carry the .40 rounded
You know how much shit that I been through
That I can't tell you
You gon' have nightmares
When you lay in your bed you

(Verse 2)
Fuck with a nigga mind
Look my momma think I made it
Since I got a dollar
They look at me like I'm crazy
Not everybody patient
But everybody caked up
When them shots fire
You stay still like a lake ha

Blocks hot like chittos
Bitch rolled like burrito
Don't put my flow on free mode
Fire it like a G Code
I be smoking red code
Send me a message P.O
I don't fuck with niggas
Questioning like gambino

Selling Tonny Devito
Godfather I'm Vito
Corleone my pistol
My coca Al Pacino

Alejandro Sosa
Bussin bullets
On north side
Gang signs from them buses
Can't walk home
On night the time

Who's them niggas in the 4 AM
On the corner and it's winter man
Fuck you nigga man
I'm the trigger man
You the pusha man
Pushing bullets man
If you fuck with gang
Gang will fuck you man
Suck up on this thang

Shut the fuck up bang
Shoot you in yo liver man
Don't you tell me yes
If I see you gain
I will buss it man
With the 40. man
I don't give a damn
Do some time in jail
Lemme get it skraight
You a pussy man
I'm the fucking man

That's why your girlfriend calling me a friend
It's a joke
He's my only friend
Only nigga that's gon' give her biggest things
Bigger than you man
You a small ass bitch
Think you getting rich
No you fucking ain't
If you think we straight
No we fucking ain't
Fucking on your wifey damn
Holy fuck
Have you ever heared about the running game
Ain't no joke
I was kidding man
Oh fuck here he comes
You so angry bro
Punch you in the front
Take your front teeth off

Runnin out of space
Runnin 1000 miles away
Lose yourself
Like the Eminem
Eat some M&M's
If you're hard
Stop complaining man
Let us conversate
I don't do
I ride in the coupe
Swallow molly ooh
