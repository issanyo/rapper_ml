Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up

I told her stop it, drop it, in a polo t and I rock it
You see the girl I'm with is chocolate
And her friend is on that vodka
And they drunk,rough sexing
I get head like a .. pour slow
, I lean back and turn slow
So cold, my mike, might need a fur coat
I love love and I hate hate
Stand on my word I be 6 8
, out of mixtape, die real, shit straight

Benz, biz paid
Been , since the 10th grade
, louies on, , other louies tied up
And I never fuck with you
You'll never have ne tied up

I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2

I tell drop it, yeah, how about it?
Shawty burning up like a pound of Wasabi
Magic city, know how to drop it
Sliding down the pole, then she pop it
She's incredible, so delicious
Wanna take a bite, she's the sweetest , kisses
Drop it low, then bring it back up
Model after model, tell her bring another model
We in this baby you already know
Straight legs bend over touch your toes
You wanna get away, I'ma let you drive this rocket
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it

I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it

She start dropping, she role
Stripping out on that pole, , bezn coop
When I'm pulling up, full as fuck
Eating right and there's more to come
This ain't fair, 4-1
, I beat it up I smash them
I cross over, I pass them

I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
Tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up
I tell her drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and give it up X 2
5,4,3,2, 1 drop it
