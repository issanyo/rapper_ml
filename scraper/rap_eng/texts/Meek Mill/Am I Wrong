[Hook: Gourdan]
Hop up out the block, straight to the jet
A nigga want it all what's wrong with that
More than a dream we the make money team
So tell what the fuck is wrong
I ain't wrong at all
After all of the time that I put in I deserve to ball
We ain't wrong at all
I done made my way to the top and I ain't falling off
We ain't wrong at all

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Am I wrong cause I want it all
Am I wrong cause I want to ball
Am I wrong for dropping fifty on this Audemar
Cause I remember times slinging dimes by that corner store
Risking my freedom, ditching them people
I'm on them papers the system want me to give them a reason
So they can shatter my dreams, now I'm a king
I'm riding Phantom Ghost you know that my passenger mean
I'm with a bad bitch rolling out cause she ain't never had shit
Scoop her out the projects and put her in this Aston
Tell me am I wrong for that nigga it's a passion
Stunting and balling, balling and flexing then I cash in
I heard these suckers talking what they heard about
But what these niggas talking it's just word of mouth
Fuck around I get them murdered though
Thirty grand I send the murder man just to blow them up

[Hook]
