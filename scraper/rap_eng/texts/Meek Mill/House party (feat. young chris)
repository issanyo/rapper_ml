Her friend knockin at the door
And she screamin out I'm cummin
I tell em meet me in the bathroom

[DJ Drama:]
House party, I'm a play the DJ Martin Lawrence
You know I'm always survivor man

[Meek Mill:]
I tell em meet me in the bathroom
I fuck her while the water runnin
Her friend knockin at the door
And she screamin out I'm cummin
And my youngin in my other room, fuckin up my sheets
She tell em boy don't grab my hair because you're fuckin up my weave
I got a hundred bottles Ciroc boy
All my jewelry cold as fuck but I'm a hot boy
All these stones in my chain make me a rock boy
And I heard you niggas talking money you should stop boy
I fuck bitches by the group I get money by the pound
French Montana on all these niggas ch-ch-ch-ch-chop em down
Every time I'm in the club these niggas is not around
Everybody talking money I say prove it not a sound
White girls gone wild
We don't judge 'em though, they ain't on trial
Bad bitches got 'em on dial
It's bottoms up but it's going down

[Chorus:]
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
Ciroc all on my table bitches in the living room
They gon ask who at the door, tryna get in too
Only me and my niggas, tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin models watching all in my living room

[Chorus:]
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
Welcome to my house party party
