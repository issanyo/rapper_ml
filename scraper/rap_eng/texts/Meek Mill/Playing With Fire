[Hook: Betty Wright]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivin down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
My new bitch she a whore cause she fuck with Gucci
And she fuck with Prada and she mess with Louie
I heard she fuck with Benji, she know that he be with me
Acting like a groupie, I let her Jimmy chew me
Her shoes be Giuseppe, mines be D squared
Double straps on them, nine hundred a pair
Ya, nominate me grinder of the year
Cause I be up early in the morning trying to grind me up a square
Just to get that dough, on your marks set go
Trying to move them O's like tic-tac-toe
When I see them hoes they be all trying to go
[?] ass niggas they be all trying to roll
But we don't move D's we just move with the heat
Live by the gun in the cold of the streets
Supposed to make it hot not cold in the streets
Same niggas running around they done told in the streets
But this is the life, what its like, by any means necessary
I'mma go and get it and retire in like Neveruary
So its 2012 for you rappers put an end to them
Scorpio flamer Mortal Kombat finish him

[Interlude: Betty Wright]
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Game spitter flame spitter, lame niggas
Couldn't bang with us or hang with us, the same niggas
Went against me, trying to partnership me now
Cold enemies on that partner shit now
Cause they know I go hard as a tombstone
Any sign of disrespect, know you in the goon zone
Anywhere you see me at know I got that tool on
Make a nigga sound good like that autotune on
Labels keep calling they worster than my bitches
Rappers speak my name I say they worster than these snitches
This is the blueprint, beginning of some new shit
But nah this ain't Jay Z this Meek Milly baby
Louie belt v neck chillen in my AP
Dawg I go crazy like I got rabies, I'm the man in my city
If you ask around the town they say nobody fucking with me

[Hook: Betty Wright]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're drivin down the streets of gold
But you, can't, blame, me, if I set this stage on fire
