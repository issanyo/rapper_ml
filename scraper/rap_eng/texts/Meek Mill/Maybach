[Part 1: Meek Mill]
I got the key to the streets, I got the key to the safe
He wanna see what Iâ€™m selling, I put a key in his face
I just got back from the dealer, I got the key to the Wraith
I got the key to the bentley truck, when I leave the booth Ima pick it up (Yeah)
When I'm in my hood bitch I do what I wanna, 250 I'm spinning the corner
You better get busy, you running up on us, no rap
Play with my niggas you know your a goner, play with my niggas you know they gon miss you
These niggas be hating, the fuck is their issue, they mad (Niggas shit)
Oh yeah, bustin it down with my real ones, they can [?]
We trynna set up the lil ones, loyalty only thing matter to me
We bout to bust with some millions, niggas is ready for felons
We the type never [could fail on?] (808 Mafia)
Walking in blood when I step in it, I'm from the P and I'm repping it
[Chino?] with me that's a definite, seen it with me I was bustin it (check)
