[Intro]
Shit, ever since I got money
I ain't been happy like I used to
They say, "You got pay the cost to be a boss"
Check this
When you the nigga with the money
Somebody go to jail, you gotta pay they bail
Somebody die, they gon' turn to you for the funeral
But I just be thinking like, "When I'm gon' be able to turn to somebody, shit"
Bosses got feelings too
I done did shit for niggas a thousand times
Told 'em, "No" one time and watch 'em talk about me crazy, run and bite my back out
But I still stood tall

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great

[Verse 1]
This the price of having money and the price of being great
Had to cut a couple homies, never heard them tell me thanks
I've been washing all my problems with these percs and all this drank
All that shit just made me tank, had me drawn let me paint
4 in the morning 88, graveyard shiftin' it
A dollar to my name and I remembered it
A nigga said I owe 'em, how? that shit the sound ridiculous
Tell a nigga "No", and they gon' show you who they really is
Trappin' since little kid, did a little bid
But I bounced back like the bullet did when it ricocheted, hit the little kid
This what it is, when the ice cream truck come through
Ain't have a dollar, that shit just made me to a boss, word to my father, woah

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great

[Verse 2]
Yeah, ain't no price on the money, ain't no price in the Lord
I got outta the system, I jumped right on the Forbes
When I got out the ghetto, I jumped right on the tour
When I stunt on that Instagram, I'm just showing them more
I'm just showing them better how to make it through any weather
Back when I said I would make it they was telling me never
Only get one chance better take it, only one shot, boy, you better
How you survive in the jungle, he be movin' so clever
I'm talkin' Tony Baretta to make it back to my son
Talkin' crab in the barrel, they pull you back where I'm from
That's why we loadin' extendos up in the back of the gun
Posted up on that corner see the paddy wagon, we run, whoa

[Chorus]
Uh, when you sitting at the top and you think you seen it all
Caught up with your dreams with nobody else to call
With tears up on my face, 'cause I know I'm gon' be straight
Had to cut a couple homies, had to learn from my mistakes
This the price of being great, oh, this the price of being great
They hate you when you're winning but they love you when you're break
This the price of being great, this the price of being great
Oh, this the price of being great, they hate you when you're winning
But they love it when you when you break, this the price of being great
