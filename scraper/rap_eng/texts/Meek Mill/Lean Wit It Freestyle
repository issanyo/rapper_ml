[Verse 1 - Gunplay]
Throwin' a half, half a quarter burnin' the bath in
Let the feathers dry, then chuck it, like a javelin
She threw like a thumble at Grambling
I need more sack, to shove all of the sand in
I'm on the way, I'm in route, I'm in transit
I'm bringin' that brown X-nay on that tan shit
Livin' outlandish, duece deuce on campus
I used to brandish, this cookie rock hard aerosmith
Murkin' alive, huh he a trip
I'm in the house, that's the bitch with thousands of pyramids
Paper cut that pussy, I'm a live wire
Jumper cable on that pussy
Get burnt for the brick and maybe kill for the cushin
He ain't built for this cousin
He'll be running with the buzzards, I'll be running with the budgets
Never running out of numbers, I'm the captain of the corner
Kakis and Coronas, brother Al Capone it
I keep a pretty blonde bitch bouncing on my boner
Pouncing on opponents 'cause they all lousy phonies
Kickin' up dust, squeeze the trigger till it rust
Middle finger to the fuzz, got my thing up in the club

[Hook - Meek Mill]
Lean with it, rock with it
Doesn't beg up in the pile with it
Microwave and we gon' power whip it
When they get up we drop the ass and they get locked with it
I tell 'em lean with it, rock with it
Doesn't beg up in the pile with it
Microwave and we gon' power whip it
When they get up we drop the ass and they get locked with it
