[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, reportin' live from the northside of litty city
You fuck my bitch, I'ma keep it player
I just want you to know that we the Navy Seals
We gon' strike your whole motherfucking platoon, nigga
Gang

Ugh

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Three bad bitches, fuckin' on me
Top floor at my penthouse, yeah
Young rich nigga, I'm on my roll
Fuckin' them hoes in my flip-flops, yeah
Fuck her, that troll and this hip-hop, woah
Nigga play me, gon' get shot (Brr)
Quarter mil' 'caine, my wrist white, woah
Bust down, Patek don't tick-tock, no
We got them birds in a drought
I caught a plaque and they hittin' it raw
This life I'm living be trippin' me out 'cause I just let a famous bitch spit in my mouth (Ew)
I'ma buy a bird for a project bitch
Rolls truck coming, I'ma cop that shit
Ass all fat, tell her pop that shit like (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Every red bottom, know I got that shit
Post it on the Gram, but you not that lit
Your favorite rapper is not that rich (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Fly Dubai on Emirates
Only fly a mob that's with the shits
All bad hoes need discipline (Booty, booty, booty, booty)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I'm in a red 'Sace robe, fuckin' on all bad bitches
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I want a brand new Rolls, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Tell her come- fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
Fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes, yeah

[Verse 2: Cardi B]
(Cardi) I bought my money ring, your's out (Woo)
Red Lamborghini with the doors out (Ugh)
I hit them the mall, clear stores out (Ugh)
Hit it to your face, get pores out, yeah
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I been hard workin' and humble
Believe me, I've heard of the mumble (Look)
I'm just gon' leave it alone (Yeah)
'Cause I would put burners to bundles
Bitches are miserable, they are so typical
Hating is cheap, not my material
Look where I'm at, run back to years ago
I used to strip, now I keep a different pole (Cardi)
I do not fuck with your kind, no
I do not fuck with your vibe, no
I am a big, boss bitch, I do not come in your size, no
(Booty, booty, booty)
I seen a bitch tryna switch sides (Switch)
Then jump back, tryna dick ride (No)
But I ain't really worried about these hoes (Huh?)
'Cause bitches are hurt, D. Rose (Yeah)
Gucci bags, 40 count stickin' out (Ugh)
If they want the smoke, then I give it out (Ugh)
I might leave my robe at your nigga house
Give you two something to figure out
I seen all these shots and they brick, brick, brick
Try something new ho, quick, quick quick
Body bag, body bag, zip, zip, zip (Booty, booty, booty, booty)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I'm in a red 'Sace robe, fuckin' on all bad bitches
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I want a brand new Rolls, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Tell her come- fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
Fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes, yeah

[Bridge: Distorted, Meek Mill and Cardi B]
I want a freak nasty ho
Freak, freak nasty ho
I'm in a red 'Sace robe (Robe, robe)
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I do not come in your size
Brand new Rolls, all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho
I seen a bitch go an' switch sides

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
I'm in a red 'Sace robe, fuckin' on all bad bitches
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I want a brand new Rolls, and I want all bad bitches
I want a freak nasty ho, that'll grant all my wishes
(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Tell her come- fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
Fuck on me, tell her come fuck on me
I want a freak nasty ho, and I want all bad bitches
