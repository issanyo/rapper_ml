[Intro: Meek Mill]
I ain't turning back niggas
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Point of no return
No turning back its all or nothing
I seen them niggas that used to be this shit all for nothing
I can't fall for nothing
So ain't no turning back
Fuck that, I watched all of their mistakes and learned from that
So go ahead nigga hate on me and watch me earn from that
Try to kill me I go out busting like I'm Bernie Mac
Cause I'm a warrior, real two-storier
Million dollar plan I keep a secret like Victoria
Niggas want to see me fall like September
Trying to stomp my flame out and watch me ember and catch again
Had to kick the door down they wouldn't let me in
I take these niggas on a level they ain't' ever been
Terminator dedicated, focus like I'm meditating
Keep it real ain't ever faking
Y'all pussies forever hating
A lot of niggas had a chance but they ain't ever take it
I do it for the hood my niggas that ain't ever make it
