[Roddy Ricch]
Package, I had racks on racks
Gotta keep the pump on me, I'ma have a Asthma attack
I'm a crip nigga, gotta put my set on the map
Keep a double cup, gotta pour fours on fours
Water on me, I could pull a jetski
A real nigga behind bars, they had to let me out
Now five bad bitches wanna sex me down
Hunnids bitches [??], then we kick back
The Richard Millie stole my wrist back
60 and a 100 racks, I did that
Got killers on go, [??] can't leave back
Gotta keep blue faces in the middle console
Roddy Ricch, all I know is popping rubber bands
I remember I was sitting in the projects
With a dollar bill, then I turned it into a hunnid bands
It ain't my fault if your main bitch choosing
Straight outta Compton, I'm a rich nigga, I'm ruthless
Hopped in the dawn, I forget where the roof is
Nine millie, I'm a snap a bitch, I shoot, chill
This a big body, barely can park it
My diamonds shaking nigga, my wrist got Parkinsons
