[Intro: Lil Snupe]
Why she worryin' bout my next bitch
Steady going on my Facebook
Tryna see how my bitch face look

[Louie V Gutta]
I said that old bitch she a groupie doe
We 'bout to make a movie ho
I take my new bitch to the mall
Me and my new bitch yeah we ball
Said we be all up in Neimans and shit
I be on the cleanest of shit
Hol' on, ion really freestyle
But nigga in the meanwhile
I got ya bitch in my coupe, me and Lil Snupe
'Bout to party ya bitch, show her what to do
'Bout to take her to the telly she gon' get it crackin'
That nigga standin' there he like what happened?

[Lil Snupe & Louie V Gutta]
Huh
Motel, hell nah bitch you better meet me at the hotel
But we ain't talkin' Cassidy
We fuck ya bitch and it's a tragedy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

My man said he gotta get up in that halfway house
So that mean he halfway in and halfway out
Halfway in and halfway out
We get the work halfway in and halfway out
What you know about 36 ridin' with a dirty brick
You had to call a ho a lil dirty bitch
Just take the ride, so when they pull you over
You got a bitch with you, you still acting sober
But you high as fuck cause you just smoked a L
And if this nigga play wrong we ain't goin' to jail
Motherfucker, ya'll niggas rats, show and tell
Cause if the cops grab ya'll, ya'll gon' show and tell
Show 'em where the stash at, where the cash at
I get a bitch ho show me where that ass at
And last time i seen the work, nigga grabbed that
Then I bagged that nigga, had that
What you know about a scale nigga?
Glock '30, giving everybody hell nigga
I did that banger, all in jail nigga
Hit you up and have you movin' like a snail nigga
Slow motion, sippin' on purp potion
I'm gettin money everybody, they know it
I be Roseing, chosen
A millionaire they say I'm chosen
Cause I came from the bottom, they told me get 'em I got 'em
Red beam on 'em, they moving you know I spot 'em
Hit 'em in the dark nigga fucking with the larks
Playin' round you get parked, 106 when I spark
On this drum clip, young nigga but I run shit
And you stupid as a dumb bitch
I make a dumb bitch give me head, let you know where I'm from bitch
The 8, posted by the gate
Before i ain't had money, I was straight
Ion fuck with none of ya'll rappers, I can't relate
All that shit you talking that nigga, it ain't
I used to play that fuckin' corner, paranoid getting high off the marijuana
Everytime i seen the cops sneak up in the corner
It was tinted cars I felt like I was a goner
I was out there all night, BR had that hard white and that soft white
Me and Omelly in the car, on call flight
Tryna swing that work nigga, this is our life
We bring that work to your door nigga (uh knock knock)
Strapped down, .44 nigga (pop pop)
Crack life but we on tour nigga, mac life let that thing roar nigga
I seen niggas go to early graves
For tryna play with hammers in they early days
A lotta niggas on ho shit, got girly ways
I fall back I got nah, got pearly waves
My shit flowin', and I'mma keep on goin'
And I'mma get this money, everybody they be knowin'
That I came from the bottom and I made it to the top
And I started with a '22, I made it to a Glock
Then I stepped up to the mac, then I went and copped a bat
'Member started with the 'lac, back then remember that?
We was getting chased by the rock
He caught his own ? down on snub block
He got booked with an ounce of crack, shit was rock
They tried to take that nigga in, we hold up shit to stop, put it in the car
They couldn't even find the O nigga, it was hard
He put that thing behind the badge, shit it was soft
He couldn't find it, had to rewind us
We all got booked with the lil' pair of Irons
Let me bring it back and remind it
The same block I got pulled on when they found us
Put me in the cell, we was comin' a scooby
We had a lil sprinter, we ain't come in a hoopty
He come down I told my niggas, "mm mm"
I put a hole in ya head, I ain't talking no coofy nigga
I Rich Blade,  talking no Coogi nigga
I slip you one, ain't talking no Roofy nigga
You playin' round nigga we gon' gun ya down
Walk up on you, if you running we gon' run ya down
My young niggas gettin' money, we don't fuck around
All ya;ll niggas on your team, ya'll fuckin' clowns
It's all real niggas, we don't rob we kill niggas
We treat 'em like, ya'll niggas pump fake and fire drill niggas
