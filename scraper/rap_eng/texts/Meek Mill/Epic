[Intro: B.o.B & Meek Mill]
Yeah, ayy, Bob, what up?
Meek Milly! Ayy!
Grand Hustle in the building! Hey!
It's B-O, B-O
Lil' C, on the beat, ha-ha!

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
You know who it is without a doubt or hesitation
If money talks, I got my masters in communications
But you can’t hold a conversation
Probably find me burning something good
You can call that smoking aces
Compliment the chef in the lab making greatness
Ain’t a thing changed but the number on the statement
NBA resume, balling's my occupation
Kush so loud I can’t hear what was you saying
Bass go so low that the freaks in the backseat
Get a thrill off the alpine when it vibrate they ass cheeks
I’m Bobby Ray baby an all american athlete
I run and leap and jump in that pussy like a track meet
Yeah, that ought to do it, give it that Carl Lewis
I got the magic baby, call me George Lucas
I’m so prolific but my flow’s so foolish
These niggas making moves, my niggas making movies, wait

[Verse 2: Playboy Tre]
Wild like a crazy night, clean like a baby wipe
Y'all just a momma boy, sleeping with a baby light
My ex say I’m a dick 'cause my mindframe cocky
Up in Beninhana, drunk as fuck, drinking all the sake
Damn right, I want a double fried rice, I’m getting bread
I put my dick up in ya face, ya face’ll look like Stewie's head
Girls call me Tre-Day, I’m looking for payday
My squad’s got more bottle poppin’ niggas than the AA
Liquor and wheelbarrow, foolish as Will Ferrell
But I ain’t got a step brother, I fuck your step mother
I cuss cause I like it, bitch, fuck, ho, motherfucker
You mad cause I’m balling (ha!), life is a motherfucker
Short like a leprechaun, so hater, live life a little
New shit dropping soon, “Patron and Instrumentals”
Til' then stay tuned, freak, and thanks for the hot gin
It’s Tre-Boy, my flow won’t quit til I say it ends, yeah!

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Eastside on my arm, 3 stripes on my sneakers
Don’t roll with pussy niggas, we call them vajeenas
That’s why your girl choosing dawg, pray I never meet her
I tap her on the head and tell her, "You know the procedure"
You just mad with no bitch 'cause I’m chilling with your bitch
She threw out your mixtape but she knows my whole disc
My flow’s sick, I’m a poet, Edgar Allan Poe shit
Haters be getting defensive like 4th down, they show blitz
But I don’t punt it, I run it for a hundred
Ever since I was a youngin', been hungry as Paul Bunyan
I’m the shit so fix the plumbing, I’m a beast in the game, Jumanji
And if this ain’t what you call hip-hop it must be bungee jumping
I’m smoking on hydroponic some of you call that chronic
Hennessey in my vomit cause the night before jumpin’
Lil C got that beat bumping so you can hear me coming
And my name’s Bobby Ray, Eastside of the A
Just in case anyone was wondering, bitch

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Boy, I’m a motherfucking beast, all my haters rest in peace
I make a hundred on the Monday and go hard the rest of week
Pray on niggas like a Sunday, see your artist, that’s a feast
I got like 30 in the chalk I let you pussies catch a piece
It's just me and Omelly in the Scaglietti
Bout to scoop these bitches cause they say they past ready
Swagger on infinity, I think I’m Andretti
I push it to the limit get 'em haters gassed heavy
Wait a minute I'm a menace, shout out to the winners
Jacket boy Louies like a flag before the finish
I’m just getting started and niggas at they end
And errbody say I’m hot but I’ve been hot from the beginning, uh
I be with a bitch that looks like Kim Kardashian
Shittin' on these niggas not by purpose but by accident
Big cribs, I be laxin' in, you niggas relaxing
And the main reason I’m passing 'em like Michael Vick
I'm faster than yo quarter back, I bring that order back
Ain't fucking with that weed, like where that water at?
Like where them perks nigga, somebody order that
Caught a couple cases, went to jail but I ain't going back
