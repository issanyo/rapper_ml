MEEK MILL
If I could take the time back, I would rewind back
The day my cousin asked my gran where his mom at
I want my aunt back and my dad too
They killed Shawty and Diddy that was sad too
I cut a couple homies off, shit I had to
Changed on me for the money, look what cash do
Thinking I’m rich, counting my money
Worrying bout mine, they should be counting it for me
I’m just adding up this paper subtracting my homies
Shawty be screaming how she love me, while bouncing it on me
She really don’t like me, she just attracted to money
She chasing the benjys, so that don’t offend me
Im just loading up my Glock, hoping that it defend me
When them haters try to kill me I’m clapping the semi
She giving me head, I’m grabbing her Remy
I just wanna B, like the back of the Bentley
Niggas say I’m Hollywood when I’m Hollyhood
Put my life on the line for them, shit I probably would
Switch that to probably woulda, They wit me probably coulda
Put'em on probably shoulda, but ain’t nobody realer
Niggas is so fake, I did my ID check
Kept It A Hunnit Wit Me ?, ain't met nobody yet
I treat them like the beat, cuz ima body that
Moving throughout these streets, that’s where you find me at
But you ain't gon be running round, like you made my life
I ain’t met a bitch yet, I would’ve made my wife
And I ain’t met a nigga yet I would’ve made my right
Hand, damn, never take a stand
Never tell them boys information on your fam
Never tell them niggas information where you stayin
Cuz they change like the weather, when you wake they're where you land
With that hammer in your face, askin for the cake
Ever seen one of your dogs transform into a snake
Ever seen one of them snakes transform into a rat
I be running through the jungle I could tell you bout that
I could tell you bout the drought, when the work got snapped
Whole hood started robbing, everybody got strapped
Whole team just was broke, everybody got back
I was selling Sour Diesel, everybody got crack
It’s obvious I’m hot, it’s obvious you cold
Presidential on my wrist, and it’s obvious its gold
Whole hood got your statements it’s obvious you told
Like a Lil Wayne album it’s obvious you sold
I’m on some shit, running neck and neck with Vick
Trying to bring my city back, take us to where we never been
I’m just in the studio working like a Mexican
And they tell me I’m a rookie doing it like a veteran
Yea, big dreams small city
Trying to come up on me, but would you fall with me?
Would you clutch that hammer and bust it off with me?
Hundred miles an hour running from the law with me?
I ain’t think so, I just blink slow
Million ways to get this money but we think snow
Every time I see a chick I just think ho
And every time I meet a nigga I just think Po’
Alpo ass niggas!
Moment for life, for life
I'mma keep it real for life
And I'mma keep getting money, fuckin' bitches for life, for life, for life
Yeah, yeah!
