[Intro]
I ain't never give a fuck
You think I'm supposed to give a fuck now cause I'm rich?
Shit on me made me worse
Hatin' ass niggas made me worse

[Bridge]
I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, it just make me
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 1]
And I done seen bitches change on me for a little paper
And I done seen niggas change on me for a little favor
It just make me, wanna stunt on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna fuck on ya'll bitches
And I be popping bottles in the club feelin' like Meecho
And you know my niggas gonna bring them choppers everywhere we go
And I don't ever tuck my chain I guess it's just a niggas ego
I'm just a young nigga ballin' wanna take me out the game D Rose
And that make me, wanna load up the choppers go crazy
And doors slide on every niggas that hatin' me
And stunt on every single bitch that ever played me back then
You don't wanna hear the Mac-10
No one hear the stories what you had then
Reason why I bought the Bentley and the Aston
To shit on niggas every time a nigga back in

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 2]
And it made me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
Cause lately, I ain't been feelin' ya'll niggas
Try and play me, I drop a brick on ya'll niggas
And make 'em go crazy, on every single one of ya'll niggas straight up
And all these hoes wanna fuck with a nigga like me
But when I was locked down ain't none of these hoes write me
That's why I don't chase bitches cause the money only thing excite me
And I don't fuck with new niggas all day one niggas beside me
We got thirties, ridin' round tryna do a nigga dirty
Try and burn me, headshot bye bye for a birdie
And I ain't worried, about none of ya'll niggas tryna hurt me
I got all these killers on stand-by
And they kill any nigga tryna murk me word up

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 3]
We don't never hate we ain't rattin' on nobody
When I touch twenty mill I'm a go and get that Gatti'
It just make me, wanna stack this paper
It just make me, wanna wack these haters straight up
And I be in the city going hard like a nigga own that
And you be fucking with the nigga that be fucking with the niggas code rats
I can't control my dogs with them 30's they don't never hold back
Ask about me in my city they tell you that we really on that
I got the baddest bitch
I got the fliest whips
And god bless me I never ever gettin' tired of this
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Cause if I was worried bout somethin'
All ya'll niggas gettin' murdered bout' somethin' straight up

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up
