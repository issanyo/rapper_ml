[Intro: Meek Mill]
Sun go down and the sticks come out
Momma won't save you when the pistols out
When the pistols out

[Hook: Meek Mill]
All my North Philly nigga be like (doo, doo, doo)
Stop playing with a nigga (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga
All my South Philly niggas be like (doo, doo, doo)
I ain't playing with you niggas (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga

[Verse 1: Muslida Bey]
South Philly niggas ain't playing with you niggas
Drum gone spin like fans on you niggas
Drop a few birds and bands on you niggas
Have to lay low cause the feds on the bag [?]
Doo, doo, doo stick 'em
Got a few birds in the kitchen
South Philly niggas is vicious
Heard you got bread on your biscuit
Pin it to your wig like clippers
[?]
Chop your ass down to my slippers
Find you ass floating in a river
Heart so cold that I shiver
Know I'm gone slide for my niggas
I'mma die for my niggas
Strapped down and ride for my niggas
Pull up and bomb on you niggas
Word to my mom on niggas
Squeeze lemon limes on you niggas
I'mma bomb on you niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
All my North Philly nigga be like (doo, doo, doo)
Stop playing with a nigga (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga
All my South Philly niggas be like (doo, doo, doo)
I ain't playing with you niggas (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Riding with a chopper in the [?]
On the north side of Philly where it's kind of real
I point the finger and you out of there
Young boy eat the green that Koala bear
Brand new mac-11 with a beam on top of there
[?] like a rocking chair
All these shooters that I got in here
We run down on nigga they running out of fear
I'm a north nigga by the end of the day
Gun butt a nigga with the end of the k
Kick you in the ass and send you away
They come around here like you niggas is safe
Cause all my hitters go doo, doo, doo
There he go
There go them niggas we spinning the corners like doo, doo, doo
Fuck a jump out we just running them off like doo, doo, doo

[Hook: Meek Mill]
All my North Philly nigga be like (doo, doo, doo)
Stop playing with a nigga (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga
All my South Philly niggas be like (doo, doo, doo)
I ain't playing with you niggas (doo, doo, doo)
Drop bands on a nigga
On the head of a nigga
Have them land on a nigga
