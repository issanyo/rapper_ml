[Intro]
Gold presidential for the gold digging bitches
Bouncing on the bands she like I'm fuckin' hitting switches
Gold presidential for the gold digging bitches
Bouncing on the bands she like I'm fuckin' hitting switches
Gold presidential for the gold digging bitches
Bouncing on the bands she like I'm fuckin' hitting switches

[Verse 1]
I pull up like what the business
Fuck you niggas feelings
Puffing dro and paper stacking money to the ceiling
I been balling for a year or two
I don't think I'm going back
Walk up in the club
And make them bitches have a ho attack
Or should I say a heart attacking go into cardiac
I'm gon' let her ride but she ain't fucking then she walking back
You niggas be talking that
Same shit I'm living though
Faded like I'm Michael Jordan
But I'm Scottie Pippen though
Different state
Different place
End up with a different ho
Niggas hating in the hood
I ain't even tripping though
I be walking through my city like a fucking king
I'm in these streets
Just ask around I do my fucking thing
Yeah I been eating since they let me out the fucking bin
Nobody told me this the shit that all this money bring

[Chorus]
You know the team, it's MMG
Rookie of the year, I'm MVP
I'm gettin' paper, it's M.O.B
She asked me who I think I am, I told her bitch I'm me
I tell her bitch I'm me, bitch I'm me
I tell her bitch I'm me, bitch I'm me
My niggas is balling, you niggas is hating
Cameras everywhere I go, a movie in the making
I tell her bitch I'm me

[Verse 2]
I get that work out my face
I put that shit on my man
I give it straight to Omelly he selling 30 a gram
I put them b's on your team
And they gon' murder your man
Black and white maro looking like the hamburglar
Damn I got bars
Outer space I'm on mars
I forever do my thing
Pull strings, guitar
Before I had a deal I was a fuckin hood star
And I ain't chewing cause my goon is riding like a good car
I'm the topic of discussion
Waka bitch I'm bustin
Rollie face blue
Like I'm cripping on em cousin
Nigga you ain't got it you just looking like you stunting
I was there, you called my man and you was looking for an onion, lame
We on the same road but it's a different lane
And all you niggas telling like it's a different game
In the district, pointing pictures, giving names
They shoot at us, we kill em all and we get the blame

You know the team, it's MMG
Rookie of the year, I'm MVP
I'm gettin' paper, it's M.O.B
She asked me who I think I am, I told her bitch I'm me
I tell her bitch I'm me, bitch I'm me
I tell her bitch I'm me, bitch I'm me
My niggas is balling, you niggas is hating
Cameras everywhere I go, a movie in the making
I tell her bitch I'm me

[Outro: DJ Drama]
Your best DJ Drama interpretation
Is only going to get you what I've already done, be yourself
