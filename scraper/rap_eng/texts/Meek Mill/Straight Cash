[Hook]
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, straight cash
B-b-bitch I'm like a register 3x
Money, cars, clothes, and hoes
I don't get enough of them
Hating ass fraud niggas, nah we don't fuck with them
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, stra-stra-stra-straight cash

[Verse 1]
Yeah, a hundred hundreds, that's ten stacks
Sitting in my pocket, you get that?
I fuck your girl, give your bitch bad
Pull up in that Benz, hold up girl, he get that
Oh, he did what? I be stunting on 'em
Even the niggas with them bricks saying I got nothing on 'em
Look at the jack boys, let 'em run up on 'em
And I be dumping on 'em
Yeah, I got something for 'em
Glock seventeen, in my seven jeans
Do them niggas dirty, it be a bloody scene
I like my yayo white and my money green
It's BA, bitch, fuck that other team
All you niggas rats, you ain't fucking balling
I be shitting on these lames like they [?]
I eat rappers too, go and get your artist
1-800-Hustler, you should fucking call us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Twenty grand, you don't understand
I'm my Miami Ocean drive on fucking hands
She ask me who I be, I said the fucking man
Let's cut the bullshit, is we fucking, man?
Somebody wake me up, swear to God I'm dreaming
Lamborghini, hundred miles an hour and I'm leaning
Banging flames too, they say my style the meanest
Swagger on 100, I got it from [?]
The money here, the bitches too
You need some paper, this what you do
Call my nigga up, he say sending you
You tell him "me" you pay for one and he gonna give you two
Dope boy, turned rapper now
Somebody let them haters out, I back them down
Benjamins, we count them by the pound
I was broke as a joke, but guess who's laughing now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck a money machine, I'm a money machine
All my niggas they get it, yeah running the team
I ain't chasing the paper, it be running to me
Niggas talking that money shit till they run into me
I ain't saving shit, I'mma blow it all
I'm Miami King of Diamonds, I'mma throw it all
Keep them haters from around me, them niggas throw me off
I was broke, I was quiet, now I be showing off

[Outro]
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register
Straight cash, straight cash
Bitch I'm like a register 4x
