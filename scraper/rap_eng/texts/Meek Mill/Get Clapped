[Intro: Meek Mill]
Fuck around get clapped
Fuck around get clapped, fuck around get
Fuck around get clapped ya nigga we strapped
Fuck around get clapped
Fuck around get clapped
Fuck around get clapped

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Oh lord I'm feeling myself
I'm in the big boy Phantom with the suicide doors I'm killing myself
I got a bad bitch with me and a brand new semi that's still on my belt
I ain't feeling these niggas I'm grilling these nigga I'll kill them myself
Fuck around get clapped, fuck around get clapped
Fuck around get clapped, ya nigga we strapped
Fuck around get clapped, fuck around get clapped
Ya nigga we strapped
Fuck around get clapped, fuck around get clapped
Ya nigga we strapped
Fuck around get clapped, cause we ain't playing like that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
She pop molly pop that pussy
He pop fly weed pop that pussy
That's your chick I got that pussy
I treat that shit like project pussy
Like hold up, rolling in the foreign we show up
Sipping on lean my team we pour up
Pull up to the scene that's me she know us
Pockets full of green like a four leaf clover
Hold up wait, we walk in this bitch we fuck shit up and we leave gone
Hold up wait, I walk up to his bitch talk start talking that shit then she's gone
Back to the condo, where other niggas main bitches turn to side hoes
And shorty brought her friends with her tell them swallow
And we ain't talking Twitter nigga they gon' follow, hi ho

[Hook]
