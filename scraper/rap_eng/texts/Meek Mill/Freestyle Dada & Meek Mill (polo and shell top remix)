Yeah
Yeah....
Freestyle Dada
I remember....

[Verse 1] - Freestyle Dada
I remember time niggas used to laugh
Just because they see me hanging with the south
They try and use me hang with the girls
Just to get some POLO AND SOME SHELL TOPS
Vampy world
But the world is hott
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I being seeing bitches blocking and they better rot
See me hiding and then tripping till 12'oclock
911
And they bow down
Heading to the top never going down
You standing to your momma who don't calm down
Cos niggas gonna trip
What you doing now
Standing with the hoes
Spending all my dim
Riding with the folks
But they riding with girl
You tracking all my cell
To know what i got
And niggas you tripping,so fuck what you got
Get the banging and a piece
Money and a polo
You sneezing all the greze
Got the money and the dollar
Rolling with the yeast,men you need a lot of powder
Spanking bitches in their ass,men you need a new brother like....

[Hook]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops

[Verse 2] MEEK MILL

I done seen close neighbors lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends, you turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost, and a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, Awhhh
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'mma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

[Hook]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble

And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops
