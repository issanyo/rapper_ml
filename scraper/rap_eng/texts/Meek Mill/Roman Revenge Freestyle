[Into:]
I be spittin' fire like a dungeon dragon
I be spittin' fire like a dungeon dragon
Leggo!

[Freestyle:]
@MeekMill, follow me bitch
Don't you spit, girl swallow my ish
If I had a dollar every model I hit
And a quarter just for every single bottle I sip
I'd prolly make the Forbes
No prolly, it's for sure
I'm prolly on the tour
Prolly partyin' some more
Back stage goin' ham
Sloppy Toppy On The Floor
I been winnin' whole game
I monopoly the board

I'm verified, give me my stamp
I'm underrated, K. Durant
My money tell me to get it jumpin
I play the ramp
You like Pacquiao
You wanna face the champ?

I'm Floyd, in my new toy
On my way to Boyd
You lookin like a boy
And this is abuse, this is the truth
Treat the mic like my toilet I shit in the booth
Get so many funny stares
Hard wrists in the coupe
On my old school shit just listenin' to SNOOP!
Rollin' down the street
Gin with the Juice
Gettin' money now you hate
This what you do?!

You ever play roulette?
Well this what you do:
Put a bullet in the gun and put it to you
You pull the trigger back
If the hammer don't bang
You pull that trigger again til you blow out your brain
You hater!

I'm way past ruthless
You don't know I'm hot?
You way past stupid!
Everybody know I made my movement
Why they in Phantom bangin' Maybach Music?
Cause I'm rollin with Ross and Ross rollin' with Splif
Ain't gotta shoot the vid' to show you we on some shit
You can look at the neck and tell it glow from the wrist
I ain't even drop an album, but I'm global as shit

Shout out to Khaled
We the best
Ask the hoes, they gonna tell you he a mess
Why you dissin' though?
He a stress
Say the wrong thing
He gonna need a vest!

I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone
Sippin' on Patron and Ciroc I'm on
Killin' this beat
What the fuck am I doin'?
30 pounds of weed, lookin' like a front lawn!

I got it in
I got it out
Who in the buildin'?
Let me show 'em out...
