[Instrumental]

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking,lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say, I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip

[Outro]
Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
Fighting strong, fighting strong
Fighting harder, fight stronger
