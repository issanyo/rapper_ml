[Intro: Rick Ross]
Make sure you know what you're dealing with now

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got some bad hoes in my crib, coup' stones in my couch
Scarface in this bitch, it's like a gun store in my house
Whole bird on my desk, bag it up by ounce
The feds watchin this bitch, oh lord it's three strikes and I'm out
I'm gone
What's your body count nigga? I'm double digits
Thirty birds I'm thinkin' we gon need another kitchen
I used to pack my little work fuck up my mother dishes
Now I'm the one to get the word to get a couple pigeons
Then we cook em up, and let 'em dry
We break it down, and let em fly
Send em to the hood, and tell em bye
All my niggas liftin weight but we dont exercise
Ha!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Murder after murder, nigga you ain't heard
'Cause when it come to beef, I'm puttin' bread all on my burger
Man them shooters be so hungry
With bodies on they burner
I could send em to your crib
And once they spot you and confirm ya
They gon tear you out the frame
Fuckin' rip your picture
Send a message to your homie just to make him get the picture
And if they tellin on me
I could make em hit the witness
They been off 'em like a summons
Dawg don't make me give 'em business
Talkin all that killa shit now what's your body count
Shotty bounce will make your motherfuckin' body bounce
We on the graveyard shift where all the bodies found
[?] on twenty-threes
Them make the ride it bounce
Ah

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digits
What you talkin' bout nigga?
It's time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
They all exquisite
Couple million in the couch
Right here where I'm sittin'
