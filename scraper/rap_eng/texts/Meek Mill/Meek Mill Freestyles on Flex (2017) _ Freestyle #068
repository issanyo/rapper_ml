[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

Last night was mad real
Popping percs like they was advils
And i've been putting on for my city
7 summers and they acting like they mad still
Damn, I showed these niggas how that cash feel
I even let em eat my last meal
And any nigga go against the squad, you know I gotta make a call and that man killed (let me pop my shit, uh)
Two maybachs, couple milli, I'm feeling great
So much love when you barely can feel the hate
Them hoes love when you pulling up in that Wraith
For the love of that money your dog'll turn to a snake
Your homie turned to a rat, he is fighting his case
They talked in that federal and he praying they keep his state
He praying to make it home
But you ain't answer your phone
Cause it's word on the street, them people didn't put him on
He got your name to 'em like several times
Trying to put you in a cell 'til you 75
Should've knew it when that nigga said "I'm telling my mom"
Them people grabbed you and you wasn't surprised
What a nightmare
I'm having flashes about that corner selling, that right there
Cops riding past, '40 on me I got it right here
And I ain't trying to lose nigga
Play it by the rules nigga
When you get that money watch the way them bitches choose nigga
Fuck you like the pornstar, just don't lose your cool nigga
Pussy taste good, but it won't feed you like no food nigga
We was putting work in 'til we had to keep that tool with us
Took that shit to school with us (yeah, let me tell 'em)
Pulled up in my hood and I jump out the Wraith
Bust down, Patek, diamonds jump out the face
Fear of god on me, I got nothing but faith
Like where the love, I'm feeling nothing but hate
I'm from a hood where before you make it to the morgue niggas will come to your place
Day 1's all in your crib trying to touch in your safe
They shisty, got a nerve to even come to the wake
Seen your son and give him fuck if he ain't
That's why I'm cut throat
New bent truck ghost, I move
Get the upmost respect when I come through
Nigga, i get up close and personal
I bang on you vertical when I up toast
Move like I a ghost get the pie or you sell ghost, gang

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]

Put some respeck on my name
They got me feeling like baby
Diamonds they on me go crazy
Saint laurent on me no wavy
Fucking around we ain't fucking around I can't fuck with these niggas they shady
I know your jewelry fugazi
I know the jeweler who made it , fraud
I know these niggas gone talk about us
We getting money they talk about us
We never ever gone talk about us
We only trapping the tug a dollar
Wait, wait, wait
I'm tryna flip and get all the profits
I had his bitch and I ain't call him bout her
I tell that nigga ''I'm sorry about her"
Shotty popping in the dog filter
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, nigga
I'ma shoot him, I don't call niggas
On the deuce like Wall nigga
Cross her over hit her with the oooh
In the Wraith, stars in the roof
Light her up like Pikachu
In the ghost playing peek-a-boo
Wait, Niggas can't figure me out, hey
I keep a stick in the house, ay
I got a brick in the couch, ay
Sit on that shit in the drought, ay
Sell it for trip of the mount, ay
Stack it up, bag it up, add it up, ready for shipment, we sending 'em out , gang
I just got some brand new shmoney
I just got some brand new shmoney

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]

We went from selling cocaina
To selling out arenas
Yeah, get Louis flip flops pulling yachts out the marinas
Dirty young bulls living like you've never seen a
Flows on jalapena
My hoes on aquafina
I goes the la marina
The scoop and spanish broad
I met me a spanish plug
He getting Evander off, that Holyfield I hand him the cash
Throw me a raw, you know it's real
Ducking them indictments, it was so excitin'
Serving pipers that go to vegas, back when Floyd was fightin'
Carbon fiber 'rari the tire when we floor i'm buying
Bitches used to tell us we ugly now we being biased
We survivors, we beat them streets, young nigga we surviving
Walk in the building, look at the sheep when they see a lion
Totin' choppers, ducking narcotics, and we being beating bodies
Man I be getting niggas pussy just from being biased
Tell me I'm losing what do you mean?
Westbrook baby, no switching teams
Drop this triple double every time I'm on the scene
I won't claim that bitch, that's Billie Jean
She's not my lover
Lethal weapon, Danny Glover
O.J style when I cut her
Put my gloves up, say I'm not guilty I lucked up
These niggas got me fucked up
Ball on these niggas every time I cop
Coming down Collins in a brand new drop
Hermes seats,  with my son lil pop
Watching cartoons in the back, spongebob
Wins and Losses, we in the building you already know its New York City
It's your boy Meek Milly
IT'S YOUR BOY MEEK MILLY IN THIS BITCH FATBOY WHAT'S UP
