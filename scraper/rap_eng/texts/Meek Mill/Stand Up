[Intro: Meek Mill (DJ Khaled)]
When you go out, you want an obituary or a documentary?
Which one you want Khaled?
(I want money)
A documentary, right?
(I want that too!)
We gotta make movies

[Verse 1]
Bright lights attracted bad bitches
And attracted mad niggas
Whoever thought lil' ol' Meek Milly'd pass Jigga?
I'm just thinkin' a tad bigger
You niggas talk fly, only fly at your last picture
And you look like the last pitcher
I just hit a home run, on clash with us
And this money, murder, power, comin' for the ass, nigga, ass, niggas
Last nigga, there were cemeteries diggin' grass, nigga
The obituary leaves the last scripture
Mama said he was a good kid, thinkin' would kid
I signed my deal with my AP on
In the drop top with the AC on
Stuntin' with Cash Money, get my Baby on
No, never fuck a chick that got Bakers on
Or no Michael Kors
I'm on the same shit that Mike was on
Jordan, Jackson, Tyson on
I've seen niggas your type twice before
I'm in that white velour, look at the flights I bought
These mothafuckin' hoes got a right to raw
When a young real nigga light the floor
Hundred black bottles, man that's lights galore
Before Tom was Ford, I'm talkin' Honda Accord
Lookin' for a plug, tryna find the cord
Niggas gettin' shot tryna find the Lord
This bust down Rollie say the time is yours
I get my grindin' on
Like rude girl in the reggae, it was mayday
Started with a water gun until I got an AK
Kids in the projects when we was by the bay, bay
Kids with the Pyrex, I hit it first, Ray J

[Hook]
When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
Real nigga for life

[Verse 2]
As the rain drop, drop on the pavement
I came through my hood Mulsanne'n
On the block all night like I ain't famous
I still run with the same niggas I came with
Where I came from, when I came in
We eatin' lobster and steak from Top Ramen
Oodles n'Oodles, when you're hungry them killers'll do you
And when you're gettin' to that money them people pursue you
The Feds lurkin', the streets watchin'
Them hoes talkin', like "he got it"
And he nervous, cause we plottin'
We call that boy for a burner and we rob him
Like Batman, pussy niggas gettin' backhand
Talkin' to the people you a at man
Half rack, we got more ghosts than Pac-Man
And for that paper we be grindin' like a lapdance
Get the money young nigga
Get the money, never fold, cause they comin' young nigga
When the feds get to rushin', better not tell on young nigga
Don't be selfish young nigga, just man up, don't give the fam up
Facin' 20 years when they added them grams up
Plus 5 more, he got booked with a handgun
And now he in the courtroom, givin' his mans up
Rat ass nigga

[Hook]
When the lights low, and the show starts
And the champagne spill on your bow tie
And your dawg change up, playin' both sides
No it won't stop, when the dope stop
When the fed rush in the dope spot
And your main man tell 'em how the coke drop
How he rain danced with me by the boat dock
I know when he did that, I bet that your ghost drop
I hope that you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I'm just hopin' you stand up
Young nigga just man up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
I just hope that you man up and don't give the fam up
Real nigga for life
