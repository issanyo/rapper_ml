[Hook:Meek Mill]
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'mma take yo money

[Verse 1:Yellowz]
Scared money won't make no money
I be stacking up racks if i ever did make it
Like damn these haters that tryna hold me back
I thought I couldn't make it
I never knew if I was gifted
I've been tryna make some new changes
Got these niggas motivated
But i ain't even educated
I never listened to no shit
I've been tryna make a hit
On this fucking remix
If you come across me
(gunshot!)
I've been living life all broke
Nigga this ain't no joke
I've been aiming for those gold
Born with a sick flow
Fucking each and different hoes
Nigga that's how it goes
Cause this is how we roll
Nigga I ain't telling no lies I gon shine so bright it'll make your eyes blind
I gon work all day i gont hustle no break
I'm never scared no money i just go and tryna get it
Fuck you niggas that tryna stop me

[Hook:Meek Mill]
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'mma take yo money
