[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got 'bout a hundred of the mud (straight up)
But she just want to fuck and smoke (dope)
Lil mama know what it’s gon be
She just wanna fuck and smoke (skrrt)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (straight up)
She don’t pay no mind, she just fuck and smoke (La Flame)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (dope)
La flame, will you be mine, she just fuck and smoke

[Verse 1: Trav]
Coming off of the Xan, I think I can float
I'ma pop the seal, and pour another four (deuce)
I don’t want to fuck, I just want the throat (neck)
Sit back and relax while I roll this dope
If she don’t fuck my man than she got to go
(Ah) Adios, arrivederci (gone)
We ain’t got no time for no fucking foreplay
You tryna fuck? Then you can call me
Miami ho, she just want to fuck and smoke (straight up)
My Dallas ho, she just want to fuck and smoke (straight up)
My New York bitch, she just want to talk shit (annoying ho)
At the end we just fuck and smoke (smoke)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got 'bout a hundred of the mud (straight up)
But she just want to fuck and smoke (dope)
Lil mama know what it’s gon be
She just wanna fuck and smoke (skrrt)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (straight up)
She don’t pay no mind, she just fuck and smoke (La Flame)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (dope)
La flame, will you be mine, she just fuck and smoke

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Keys to the penthouse, smoking and fucking the prettiest women
In V’s when we been out, rocking Givenchy, you never was in it
Cause these ain’t never been out
I fall from the back smoking kush while we did it
And she had to get out (see you later)
And you believed it’s her friend’s house
One time for my boss head bitches
Smoke kush with a boss ass nigga
That boy gon sponsor you ho, how bout don’t cross that nigga
Real shit, I plug that nigga, keeping my hoes up to par
Double M that be my team, DC you know who we are
Homie you a fuck boy
Won’t pay no mind to you, won’t even give time to you
She don’t like no fuck boy
Yeah, won’t play no games with you, won’t even give brain to you
She don’t like no fuck boy, hold up, hold up

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got 'bout a hundred of the mud (straight up)
But she just want to fuck and smoke (dope)
Lil mama know what it’s gon be
She just wanna fuck and smoke (skrrt)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (straight up)
She don’t pay no mind, she just fuck and smoke (La Flame)
Fuck and smoke, fuck and smoke (dope)
La flame, will you be mine, she just fuck and smoke
