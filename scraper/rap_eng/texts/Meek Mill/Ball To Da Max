[Intro: Meek Mill]
Dream team! Here we go again! We do this!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got a neck full of hate, wrist full of jealousy
When I was 18, that's when I caught my first felony
Now, I'm in a Phantom, just a cruising like Penelope
Dipping like the blue cheese and counting all the celery
All this bullshit coke, fuck is niggas selling me?
They got me in the studio, rapping; making melodies
Just to get my cash back, tryna get my stash back
Nightmares of being broke, man, I be having flashbacks
Nigga fuck my bitch, you better ask him where the cash at
All white Mazaradi, looking like a lab rat
Nigga broker than a Joke, why you think you're laughed at?
I'm a rude boy, Top Shotta like Mad Max
We was at the club, she told me "Teach me how to dougie"
Took her to lofts, she told me "Teach me how to suck it"
She only wanna fuck me cuz she know I get that money
I don't know what that bitch thinking, she can't get a dollar from me!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We ball to da max, all we know is spend it
And go and get it back
She all on my dick cuz I make a lot of paper
And I know I'm winning cuz I make a lot of haters
Swag on 100, my wrist on froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gotta go to court tomorrow, and I'm a wear my Audemar
And shit all on the D.A., kill em on a weekday
Only hit her once and now she want an instant replay
I'm bout to start selling dick, put it on EBay
All the girls'll buy it, you should come and buy it
I'll let you eat it all; put you on my dick diet
Shit, I ain't just spitting bitch, I'm getting rich by it
Niggas say they getting money, come around and get quiet
We ball to da max with it, I'm in a Maybach, I'm in the back with it
Shout out to lil (?) he on the track with it
2 9s like a hit em; Warren Sapp with it
Ok, I've been on my grind getting paper everyday
Shit, I think I'm married to the (?) everyday
Nigga crossed the line, I'm a send em (?)
Matter fact, Nah, I'm fucking all their bitches anyway

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
We ball to da max, all we know is spend it
And go and get it back
She all on my dick cuz I make a lot of paper
And I know I'm winning cuz I make a lot of haters
Swag on 100, my wrist on froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a nigga knows

Money, cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Money cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Money cash, hoes, that's all a nigga know
Nike flow; I just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it
