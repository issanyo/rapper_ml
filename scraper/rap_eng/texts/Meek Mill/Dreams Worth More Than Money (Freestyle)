[Intro]
Come on let's get it
Ya nigga my album comin'
Dreams worth more than money nigga
This mother fuckin' summer
I been gettin' so much mofuckin' money nigga
Fuckin' all these bitches
I think I done took a year off
Still snappin' though
A lot of niggas fallin' off
We ain't doing nothin' but gettin' stronger nigga
New deals, new money, double M G Dreamchaser
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
My man got booked with a stone of white
If they make his bail a 'mil, he coming home tonight
I went from standing on them corners, jumping on them flights
Talking jumping out of Bentleys, jumping on them bikes
Middle of the jungle no strap, ice on
Niggas pussy in the dark, let's turn them lights on
I used to sleep on the same floors the mice on
Now it's Italian marble, moon walking like Mike doing
Rest in peace to Mike, I rest in peace the mic
I pop a couple percs, I drink that Easter Sprite
Its levels to this shit, dog you won't believe my life
Peanut butter jelly on a french toast, eating right
Champagne gargling, everything is marvelous
62 Maybach, I can barely park the shit
Got these rappers scared see em' shaking like it's Parkinsons
If they said my name they got flamed, I'm the arsonist
A man don't eat he gonna starve, a man gonna starve he gonna die
I know that they gonna try, that's why I stay strapped with a brand new mac and it's 45
So when they jump fast, better whistle like off-sides
Cause I'm from Philly, we'll eat your cheese steak
I told Diddy, I ain't walking for no cheesecake
Cause the jeweller making the band with the freeze face
I'm on now, I got neighbors like in 3 states

[Verse 2]
Do it for the vine, I ain't gonna do it
Lets talk about the time when I use to go through it
Nappy ass braids, with the cold shooters
We was playing with razors before they had the little scooters
Shit I walked in with my Pumas on, you ain't even know it
These a million dollar pair of sneaks nigga, you ain't even know it
Said Reebok dropped Ross, we ain't even know it
Cause he went and brought that Bentley Brookland, he ain't even show it
At 21 I wanted to pop a bottle
At 22 I wanted the hottest model
At 23 I wanted the Rolls-Royce
So what you think I did, I went and fucking got it
I hit my hood, niggas looking fucking sour
They see me rolling and I be like you fucking coward
I just want to ball, spending the quarter on y'all
Just take a look at my car, you don't remember I starved
I want it all
Back in the day, packing the K
All that hate I made that go away
I do you dirty go you back to the A
Put in the verse like that Mac hit ya face
And Philly nigga, I'm mac in the bay
I'm off beat still killing shit, I'm speaking all street still killing shit
Hurricane the first week, I still killed the shit
Intro been out like a year and it's still killing shit
