[Hook]
Pull up on you, blowing on that loud thing
Then do whatever Mr. Cho bring
You brought them hatin niggas that’s been doubtin me
The money stack it up – it look like Yao Ming
Yao Ming, Yao Ming
These bitches wanna fuck, get on like Yao Ming
Yao Ming, Yao Ming
The money stack it up – it look like Yao Ming

[Verse]
I keep the bands on my wrist, half a mill on my bitch
She droppin gin to sag on my shit, foreign hoes all on my dick
Fuckin law, I could play for a fuckin case
I could play for it, 200 pounds a day
Nigga all them boys fuckin pay for it
Big titties, fake booty
Got a big dick, bitch get to it
You nigga minds I influence
DT, they tattooed
I got DD on drone
Cubans pour it in my cup
Cuban kush all in my lungs
We clean and play for the chrome
Don’t say love like I want, I wanna look at my charm
I’m stretching like Yao Ming, always my money long
As I took to Milan but I was on it else a phone
Cuz my paper like Yao Ming, these niggas just putting on
For real

[Hook]
Pull up on you, blowing on that loud thing
Then do whatever Mr. Cho bring
You brought them hatin niggas that’s been doubtin me

The money stack it up – it look like Yao Ming

[Verse]
Okay I stand tall with that China white, uh call that Yao Ming
I don’t fuck with these pussy niggas
They all singing like Al Green
We well respected, well connected
My money long and my cars clean
Gold rimes in my Aston Martin
No rollin bitch cuz my cars clean
New Lamborghini but it’s go slow
That bullshit you think it won’t work
I’m on Chi Twon, meet my nigga dirt
Nigga run up on me wrong
Pussy nigga get murked, bang bang nigga
White bricks duckin from the chain gang nigga
Cock back, head shot, playin HAM nigga
Same weed, brain finger, main thing nigga
Keep it real, can’t tell me they ain’t gang niggas
Black masks, we ain’t never gangbang nigga
Matt Black coming through the love lane nigga
You a ball playin in the shots game nigga
F then, straight through yo best game nigga
Hold up, let me slow it down for these fuck boys
We loud, joint loud, we make enough noise

[Hook]
Pull up on you, blowing on that loud thing

[Verse]
Must be Fat Trel, Alley Boy, Louie V Mob
Alley Boy took big bank that the Sosa at 6, little Biggie duct tape em all
50000 at home
‘cause yo girl chasin on my stomach
Slowly you gon probably he’ll do nothing
Hit him one thing, he screw with my number
Runnin too long but I’m showin no pity
A Town gun, bitch this my city
Jordan blowed, she ate my steak
Home of the brave, nigga fuck yo city
Alley Boy a gold mine, I’mma go with this child
Nigga got me in the dirt
With all these DT’s in they face and all the LV’s on my shirt
Money long like Yao Ming, there’s the chain, there’s no green
Best K4, there ain’t no lean
To a fuck nigga there ain’t no team
My paper talkin, my tape dogs
2 puffs on, you outlaw
Pray you beat me, hand choppa
50 rounds, face off

[Hook]
Pull up on you, blowing on that loud thing
Then do whatever Mr. Cho bring
You brought them hatin niggas that’s been doubtin me
The money stack it up – it look like Yao Ming
