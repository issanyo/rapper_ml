[Intro: DJ Drama]
Question
What does an old head and a young bull have in common?
Know the answer, anbody's liable to snitch
Real niggas stand up Philly Flamers

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I said the feds gave my nigga brick dime for an ounce of crack
And they gave my nigga [?] a dub for a bird
Stand up niggas caught their cases took the time
Feds came to get them they ain't say a fucking word
I know niggas that was OGs ratted on their own team
Took their whole clique down time for them to sit down
Same niggas acting tough tell them you a bitch now
Nigga used to do it big fuck 'em I'm the shit now
Real niggas stand up
And if you did it then there's consequences nigga man up
I remember them hungry day cutting them grams up
I stack a couple hundreds just to save a grand up
From a hundred dollars to a hundred thousand
Get you a couple bricks flood the hood like public housing
I was in the stands just watching like I was scouting
Pepping out all the players, balling Dion Waiters
Niggas in my hood are suckers beyond haters
Act hard but melt faster than Now & Laters
I just take a point I grab my the nine later
Rules to the game laugh now and cry later
Live now and die later
Fast cars, fast bitches
Live the fast life you better fall fast nigga
It ain't about who got the most it about who last nigga
And fuck a first place as long as I ain't last nigga
And I'm in the race, I'm too hungry to let a nigga taste
You trying to reach catch them in your face
My niggas ride like its the interstate
It ain't my birthday I'm getting cake
I remember sitting in the cell watching as my life replay
Writing [?] the feds got him up in VA
And free my nigga Lil' they got him upstate PA
State gave my nigga Rick [?] life
Nineteen he ain't get to live half his life
I was five I seen them lock my dad casket tight
And since then I've been clutching on the ratchet tight

[Verse 2: Oschino]
It was '05 moving birds Boston Market
Boss of the corner chilling in my corner office
It was all good, paper flowing like the Nile River
[?] some young and wild niggas
In the winter rocked the mink and in the summer dropped the top on 'em
Every other day different watch on 'em
They my niggas switched sides on me
Said they gon' ride on me
Shot me in front of my son he was just five hommie
Should've [?] cause a nigga went insane
Kingpins run the game nigga never been afraid
Bullet wounds still bleeding niggas bang them niggas back
Get rocks sold up that's how we live in this habitat
Never rat real deal, I was never an impostor
Cops sounding like Biggie Smalls asking who shot you
Don't worry about it pig, I'll handle my own
Call up [?] bang on niggas like I'm alone
One minute you a kingpin chilling with a mink
Next you a convict washing drawers in the sink
This the land of the homicide where y'all about the dollar
Most niggas here going to die before their grandfather
Niggas did [?] like Rottweiler
No gas in his crib so he can't take a hot shower
Grab his 30 gage [?] give a nigga hot shower
Cause they can't afford a burger or a fucking Caesar Salad
That's real
