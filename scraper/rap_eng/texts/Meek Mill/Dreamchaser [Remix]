[Verse 1: Tantrum T-A]
It was Fall of '96, 'Pac had just died
I was almost 6 in Kindergarten writing rhymes
Nobody didn't believe him, though I said it all the time
I'ma by my Mom a Beamer with a mansion on the side
And shout out 2 my teachers for the standards all the time
It gave me the chance to enhance and expand my vocabulary wide
Laughin' at my life as if I was Robert Klein
The Devil told me pull a Columbine, the offer was declined
Success is the best revenge that's the bottom line
So I'ma be a Rebel, fuck the Devil I'ma shine
The school system dirty, It'll never wash my mind
Uncle Sam stole the dream he sold me, I'ma rob him blind
Fast forward a couple years, It's 2000 now I'm 9
Focused on last night's dream, Johnny Shine
Til I woke up and realized that it's outta sight
And I gotta get at the cake the Dillinger way, I'm out for mine!
Fuck the stars and stripes, I pledge to dollar signs
White collar, Blue and Red collar crime
I'm tired of seeing my mama try
To provide for her family at the bottoms of society's highs
Mama I... Apologize if I ever make you traumatize
Dry ya eyes I'ma make it yo ain't gotta cry
I got belief in my dream so it's shining bright
Pardon while I dogmatize Product of the Modern Times....

[Verse 2: Tantrum T-A]
I just touched down now I'm back at it again
It's been a while but I'm back at it to win
I feel like MJ coming back after years
Except for me I'm in my prime and I'm back with a venge
Shawty call me like, "Tan where you been?"
Fake ass Barbie tryin' to nap with a kin
Hoe that's sleeping with the enemy
That's where it ends I'm branded to the end, all family no friends
Inglewood stand up I'm on my champ shit again
Police on that crab shit again I'm just pourin' out some Old E and glasses of Gin
For my Fam and my peers that done passed or in the Pen
Shout out to my real ones we the last of us here
They trying to hold us down but I'ma lash til the end
Cause life is too short to let it pass me again
So I'm grabbing at my dreams any chance that I get.....
