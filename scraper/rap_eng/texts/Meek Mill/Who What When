You gonna do somethin' to
Who (who), What (what), When (when)
Never that
If they got a problem
Tell em call me we can settle that
Matter of fact
You ain't gotta them em
I'll tell em that (I'll tell em)
And if these niggas sigh we gon slide down where they mother at
Ak-47 with the double strap
How your shit stay at the funeral
Bring my rubber back
Chicks are fuckin' with the wrong one
Yea I gotta show
Tell em but I got a long gun
Call the mac the chicken wing cause it got it's own drum
I know these niggas sick of me
'Cause I done had a long run
Countin' all this money
Fuckin' all these hoes
They was lookin' at me funny
When I pulled up in that rose
Ya'll good for talkim' on Twitter (twitter)
We good for sparkin' on niggas (sparkin')
Broad day
Walk up on a niggas head and homicide
You gonna put the chopper on a nigga

[Chorus]
Hey, you gon do somethin to
Who, what, when
You say you want it with
Who, what, when
Them shots come in with
Who, what, when
You were sayin that to
Who, what, then, fuck nigga
You'd better get that fuck shit off your mind
'Cause I'm a up that strap
You crossed the line
Cut these apples out you niggas startin spreadin the new
When I choose shit on a corpse
Hide head with the two

Where you can find me
You can find me
At the top of the list
And if they ever let me in I ain't stoppin for shit
See that motivation make you say I'm cocky as shit
Watever, fuck it tell em suck and help part of my dick
Now a day, play, I coulda possibly get em, get paid
Get out the Maybach and go hop in the jet
Know they hatin on the rise and the chilled I spin
In the Phantom, I'm lookin fly in whatever I'm in
Mostly you big niggas soft like the Michelin man
When you see other niggas standin with a pencil in hand
Carry me on stage rappin with my dick in my hand
Tryna distiguish the difference between a bitch and a fan
Outa bed, rolled one homie, never again
Cause I sold dough once now I sell it again
Fur weed 500, I sell it again
Tell the mice mane win let the elfs keep sayin

[Chorus]
Hide head with the two

I'm ballin half around, half a jet, nigga pound for pound
Only time we showin up, the shut this motha fucker down
Ridin round in the Kia, no spare tires
Chopper round shots fired
Nigga flatlines zip came to it and keep the powder savoral
Drive bys on dirt bike with Meek Milli O
Crow rock shells
I bleach em and watch em fade away
And leave a nigga block
Wetter than a rainy day
West beat Beavis when you scared to leave the crib
Guzzi and he inspired for some of the dolla mill
I'm worth mills and I beat a niggas ass still
Ya'll niggas get wasted I ain't talkin spilled bills
School a hunt knox I'm a hate a cheetah
One ya a dick sucka get your head up with the nina
And YM still strapped snookin with the cleava
Ya best bet: to run the other way when I see ya

[Chorus]
