[Intro: Meek Mill]
See I don't even knock these hoes
They don't know no better
For now on I'm gona start judging you bitches off the niggas you fucking
You hoes don't know no rock from no diamond
It's levels

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I remember smoking dope and fucking hoes
Dodging d's and poppin' pistols on the corner sellin' o's
For the love of Birkin bitches sellin' souls
Now I wake up and I fuck my dream girl and tell her whoa
Know no better, bitch don't know no better
Runnin' round town with these lame ass niggas
She don't know no better, know no better
Nigga don't know no better
Runnin' round talkin like he gonna rob me
He don't know no better

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm with a chick from the hood named Kiki
And she a bad girl like Riri
And she gon' bust it open for a real nigga
Fuck her on a perc now that ho tryna keep me
Pimpin ain't easy, no I see more she like feed me
I tell my jeweler to freeze me
Diamonds they dancing the bezel C Breezy, hol' up
Flawgin' what you think, I be driving to the bank
And my queens niggas spent 200,000 on the tank
So it's bulletproof when I roll through nigga
Everytime I come through nigga
I put a lion in the front and a camel in the back
Shit my party was a zoo nigga
You don't even have a clue nigga
You don't know no better
Tryna snatch my chain catch a whole full clip in your polo sweater
I'm a cold go go getter, that's your ho then go get her
Before she end up with some real niggas like us, she ain't bad, won't touch' her
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I remember smoking dope and fucking hoes
Dodging d's and poppin' pistols on the corner sellin' o's
For the love of Birkin bitches sellin' souls
Now I wake up and I fuck my dream girl and tell her whoa
Know no better, bitch don't know no better
Runnin' round town with these lame ass niggas
She don't know no better, know no better
Nigga don't know no better
Runnin' round talkin like he gonna rob me
He don't know no better

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking at [a mountain]
Young nigga 5 million dollar house
Still on that hood shit fucked around misplaced a whole million dollars
Fired my accountant
Bitch want a bag what you gon do for it
Meek she gotta fuck me or fuck you for it
Ho fucking up the brand you don't know no better
Fuck a real nigga it don't get no better
No stones on the Rollie theres a new sky dweller
D.C. C.M.G. we're the new Rockafella
Two doors on the ghost with the stars in the ceiling
Pay attention gotta school these niggas
Fuck a lame nigga then you a lame bitch
Let me give you the game
[Flawgin' ass] niggas keep gold digging bitches
Cus they both looking for something they really the same
I can tell the money don't flow right
New [Lamb but you still got a note right]
Bitch bad on the Gram and you liking erry pic
But she still sleeping on the floor right
Pound, These hoes be acting up
Pound These niggas be green as fuck
Pound These niggas talkin' bout robbin' us
But tell them pussies we choppered up
(I AM!)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I remember smoking dope and fucking hoes
Dodging d's and poppin' pistols on the corner sellin' o's
For the love of Birkin bitches sellin' souls
Now I wake up and I fuck my dream girl and tell her whoa
Know no better, bitch don't know no better
Runnin' round town with these lame ass niggas
She don't know no better, know no better
Nigga don't know no better
Runnin' round talkin like he gonna rob me
He don't know no better
