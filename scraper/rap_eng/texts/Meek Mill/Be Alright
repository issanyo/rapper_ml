[Hook:Gillie Da Kid]
When I was broke as a joke people used to hate on me
Now I'm on I don't need your money
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Back in the day shawty wouldn't [?]
Now its hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shawty I'mma be alright
Now you all on my dick back then you was all on Peter's pipe
You ain't used to [?] but when you see me you be [?] twice
Have the nerve to tell me I look good and now you see the ice
See the fame speak my name
Little hoes just being hoes
Being [?] when I was locked them little hoes ain't even write
[?] coldest nights living at the speed of life
Thinking when I touch I'm going to fuck them hoes and feed them right
When I was broke my nigga [?] put me on
Hit me with that hundred and forty-six and [?]
And I was gone
Nigga I ain't never look back
And I've been getting to the money ever since you heard that

[Verse 2: Gillie Da Kid]
Shawty I gon be ok don't worry about me
I don't need a bitch for shit
Just some pussy and some lips
Pull up whips, think a while ago I was loosing
Now these hoes try to hop up in that Rover while its moving
What you expect money, power, and respect
Know I'm gon be ok as long as the boy he got his [?]
Know that Gilie don't write checks
I don't give a bitch shit
Old school like Ice Cube bubblicious and some dick
[?] at the higher got a suite
With about 7 or 8 freaks
And I know these bitches sweet
Talking bout they want to eat
Dick until we skeet skeet
Like the Ying-Yang twins
But we won't give them no ends

[Hook: Gillie Da Kid]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They used to tell me tough luck
My gear was all fucked up
My sneaks was all scuffed up
Until I came to fuck up
Baddest bitches here [?] I probably fucked her
And now these niggas flipping bricks couldn't even get with this
T.I.P told me the same bitches that the boss is fucking
Gon be fucking you now long as you go harder youngin
Told him it was all or nothing
Fuck them hoes don't call or nothing
Cause when I'm in the studio I'm tryna make a movie ho
