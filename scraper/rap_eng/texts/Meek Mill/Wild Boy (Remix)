[Intro: Steve-O & Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I am Steve-O
Hahahahahah, ah-hah!
Cobain's back, yeah, Cobain's back
Got all these crazy white boys yelling Cobain's back

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly & (2 Chainz)]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's
(Yeah, 2 Chainz!)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me 2 Chainz
Eat your girl, wear my necklace, call it food chain
I'm a wild boy, been that way for a while boy
All I kill is beats and pussy, still ain't went on trial for it
Southside, my chain glowing, If them lames going then I ain't going
My aim good, my pistol dirty, chopper clean them like dish detergent
Kobe Bryant but the sicker version, Big Meech but the spitter version Meek Milly!
Stacey Dash but a thicker version (Maybach Music), getting head while the engine running, ugh!

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Aye, I'm a wild boy, strapped down like a cowboy
I'm really in the game, you just a towel boy
I pull up in that thang all on them alloys
With so many karats on, Bugs Bunny'll die for
Your bitch call me Steve-O, cause I ball like I'm D-Rose
My neck be on sub-zero and I won't save her, no hero
My wrist done cost me a 'Maro, got your whip on my wrist
You keep my name in your mouth but it keep your bitch on my dick, nigga!

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Bitch, I got my beanie and my hoodie. Here go the dick, bet you know where to put it
I'm rougher than Buckwheat's hair, you niggas softer than Jell-O pudding
I stack them up, I keep counting digits, you falling down to London bridges
Laughing at you bitches like "Na-na boo boo", bitch, cause I'm back up in here
I rip it up, I put it down when it get mean, 2 Chain, Meek Mill with the nicotine
French Montana and Machine Gun Kelly, I ain't gotta tell you how I act on 16
Gangstas don't dance no more, pussy ass nigga better stay in his place
How many times you seen one fucking rapper kill so many mother fucking rappers with an 8?

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Verse 4: French Montana]
R-r-riding with them young boys, rolling up that O-G
Rather have a hothead than to have some cold feet
Homeboy it's a new day, all my jewels is Blu-Ray
On your wife like Cool J, beat it up like the new Dre
Money here be too grown, f-f-fresher than a newborn
They try to sign a whole group, started from the group home
Moving like a boss move, MGK my dawg, fool
You know I'm a wild boy, cocaine cowboy

[Verse 5: Yo Gotti]
Had a show in Cleveland, law shut it down
Dropped that gangsta shit, security couldn't control the crowd
Bitches on that drank, my niggas on that loud
Niggas talking foul, my pistol talking POW!
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, I'm a dope boy
Top gone (transparent) where it go boy?
Lamb fettuccine sauce, inside broccoli
Got that Machine Gun Kelly and it's screamin' "Cock me"

[Verse 6: Machine Gun Kelly]
Everybody shut up (shut up) Couple of them ready to do it different
Whenever I tell them bitches to come up (come up) And I ain't talking 'bout the stairs, I'm talking for air
Somebody light a blunt up (blunt up), call me Steve-O bitch, I put a nut up
In front of your mother's face like it's nothing. Puff it till my eyes yellow when I'm with them, sun up (what up?)

What I need a shirt for? What I need a shirt for?
Tatt'ed up from my head to toe like what I need this shirt fo?
What do I need to work for? I smack the boss at my job, boy
Fucking hoes like I'm Austin Powers giving golden showers, that's wild boy (Kells)

[Hook: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
Yeah bitch, yeah bitch, call me Steve-O
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, fuck an eighth, I need O's

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly & Steve-O]
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
I'm a wild boy, I'm a, I'm a wild boy
Hahahahahah
