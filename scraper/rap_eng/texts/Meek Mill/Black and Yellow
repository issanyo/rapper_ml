Come around my town, you can see I'm running everything

[Verse 1]
Black Ice, yellow chick
Hella bad hella thick, brains intelligent
I'm in that wide body, I'm talking elephant
Great phantom in there leaning like I'm running ben
Riding with the goons, you know they hella bent
Drinking on that water purple and yellow sip
Team laker, I'm a dream chaser
Let the team take her, I'm a team player
Yeah you know I'm a fucking beast
Me myself and I, like Miami Heat

I won't say I'm rich, but I'm kinda paid

[Bridge]

Everything you do is small, and everything we do is big
I gotta retarded check, ma cartier the stupidiest
Eviction on your reck a leg and tell em that I'm moving in

Aye ya'll 15 clip curb, bring your chick around

[Verse 2]
Black and yellow, I'm in the back like hello
Shit I'm just bigging up my haters jus like Shorty L - O
Spent 20 on the bezzle, and shorty from the ghetto
You damn right I'm in it everynight
I'm fly as every pilot, I'm high as every kite
This shit I spit is deep, I'm talking Barry White
When I was in these streets I had to carry white
But now I'm rapping I just spit it, I don't barely write!

[Bridge]
Haa Uh-huh you know what it is
When Philly in the building, we do it big
