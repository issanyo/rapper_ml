I'm a full time hustler posted on the block
Got to get it to live and I'm never gon' stop
I'm a gangsta, I'm a gangsta
When the right [?] you can hear the bass knock
And the girl dem love me, me have my city lock
I'm a gansta, I'm a gansta

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You grind to get the [?] I grind to get the Rolls
I grind to stack paper, you grind to get some clothes
From where they never make it, fake niggas get exposed
Stretched out all on the payment, left there they body
No I ain't name naming, I've living by the code
My finger on the stainless ready to rock the roll
In case these niggas try to take me under
It's like a jungle outside sometimes it makes me wonder
How I'm still alive, It's like a miracle
You young black and you 25
Cause this is where they die
I'm only 20 now my people screaming get a job
They steady asking what's my goals I tell them to survive
Cause it's real in the fields murder homicide
I'm tryna to touch a million before I touch the sky
My man was only 19 them people gave him life
And he been down for like a tre and I ain't never write
Shame on my damn self not a letter right
That shit'll hurt my heart I think about you every night
Every day, all the week, once or twice
I get a deal you get a pill nigga fuck the ice
And free my nigga Lil', that's my nigga real
Racked 'til the day I die if I hit my kill
Clap niggas homicide hit 'em with the steel
And put 'em in the grave, cause we forever made

[Verse 2: ]
I'm dipped in no love but I'm greeting to the gang
It matters from the heart so why expensive with the flame
People feel my pain from the soul that's inside of me
Honestly, I've walked through a life full of rain
I'm talking cold nights, gun brawls over caine
I'm reaching for the light cause it's trifling the game
A nigga say he your man that shit ain't true
Unless he down and he ride and providing for you
The other [?] say fuck 'em no desire to prove
Separation what I deciding to do, but I've been riding since two
Since a youngin' hold it down on my own
From '89 to '07 that's 18 strong
And still hold it down on the throne, feel me
South Phil where it's real in the zone so filthy
Pain, critically acclaimed, nigga in the game, it's still blood gang
People feel my pain but it's strange but I'm focused
I see clear vision as I'm scoping my set ears open
Faithfully I'm praying and I'm hoping
Before my man that's going well love and my condolences
I noticed that's it's pure love from the heart and soul
Before my man [?] I shed my blood and my bones
They got me in the zone with the chrome bugging out
Thinking 'bout a come up how we running through the south now we out
