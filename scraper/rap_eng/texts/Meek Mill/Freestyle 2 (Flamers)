[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bills gotta get paid, kids gotta eat
Live by the chopper laws die by the streets
Fuck a job getting paid dollars by the week
I call my calls nigga I'm my own boss
Some niggas travel for the duffle make the wrong calls
And the [?] take the long fall
That's why I grind trying to shine like a lone star
To get mine right, my money and mind right
My mom right in the mix, pistol in my palm tight
You worried by a limelight I'd rather get my grind right
I rhyme nice, niggas trying to stunt like it's prom night
But I'm in my prime like Lebron in the highlight
That's why theses niggas can't stop me, copy nor clone
That's why these hoes on my, they the boy hungry
They heard I keep it real them other boys phony
But I'mma give these niggas hell 'til the lord call me

[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 2: Black Dinero]
The flow sick but I find ways to make it better
That block hot but I find ways to make that cheddar
I might drop my album might flop
But I got a lot of guap so my watch gon' shine forever
I got blocks of chicken, I love my position
I'm realer than these rappers I ain't got no competition
I'm in my own division, I make my own decisions
You tryna to stop what I'm building then I'm going to prison
I swear on everything, dawg I'll let it ring
Rock your fucking bells like LL [?] fucking rip my change
Now listen I play careful in these streets
You want to hear the real then stick your ear up to this beat
I flow hard go hard cause I got to homie
I got it soft I got is hard who tryna cop it homie
This game I play is realer than a [?]
[?] still fighting on that [?] boy

[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Wrong time wrong place caught the wrong case
They had me sitting in the F getting the O face
Thinking hard
