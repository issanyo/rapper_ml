[Chorus]
Sell a lot of dope
Dodge a lot of cases, stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains, do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases, stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular, fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular, trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular, sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular, nigga, we ain't regular

[Verse 1]
I'm out LA for a week
I'm out here playin' for keeps, yeah, yeah
I never play in them Jeeps
Double R back of the seat, yeah, yeah
I'm out here lookin' like Meech
Flooded the Patek Philippe, yeah, yeah
Boogers all up in the piece
We got the key to the streets, oh, Lord
Remember they said I was done, done
Fuck that they ain't know I'm the one, one
We get your chain and it's one, one
I tell my nigga I want one
I tell my nigga to get it back
He in the field 'bout to punt somethin'
I hit your main and your side piece
That's on the low but I'm on one
Wait, wait, wait
Switch sides, niggas switch side
We ain't never got to dick ride
More tickets than a fish fry
And the chopper had the big guy
Little nigga I'm the boss now
Came back on them game 7
Trap niggas got the ball now

[Chorus]
Sell a lot of dope
Dodge a lot of cases, stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains, do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases, stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular, fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular, trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular, sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular, nigga, we ain't regular

[Verse 2]
Woah, woah, woah
Regular, regular, regular
I do not see no competitors
Hatin' cause we got ahead of them
I'm getting money, etcetera
Bad bitches all on my schedule
Felony, felony, felony
I catch a case and it's federal
Bikes out, summer time, aye
Mikes on number nine, yeah
Bad bitch, hella fine, woah
She don't fuck, never mind, no
I'ma get at her another time
I'ma go scoop me a yellow dime
She go both ways like the yellow line
I'm fuckin' her friends, she fuckin' mine, oh shit
Still trippin', ain't no love for the other side
Rap beef turn to homicides
When we land on them and them hollows fly
Had a bag but you broke, nigga
You ain't fuckin' with me, bottom line
Out of sight, nigga, out of mind
And my Patek runnin' out of time

[Chorus]
Sell a lot of dope
Dodge a lot of cases, stickin' to the basics
Rock a lot of chains, do a lot of things
Bottles by the cases, stickin' to the basics
Do it on the regular, fuckin' on the regular
Drippin' on the regular, trippin' on the regular
Count it on the regular, sippin' on the regular
Never smokin' regular, nigga, we ain't regular
