[Intro: Meek Mill]
I can hear it in your voice you wasn't never in this shit nigga
We still at war

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Young niggas totin' Glocks
Sellin' dope, poppin' wheelies
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
We was grinding, they was hating
Perfect time to get this money, I was patient
We was Gucci, they was snaking
Only one to keep it real, when they was faking
Ain't a nigga 'round me I ain't give a hundred bands to
Never falling out, about them bitches that we ran through
When you get the money, like I got it, they can't stand you
Fuck 'em, we at war with the system, in the streets
Bulletproof I'm in the trenches, niggas said that I got beef
I can't really trust these niggas 'bout this cash, and I can't sleep
And my homie lined my other homie up, 'cause he a creep
Show no love for that pussy ass nigga, it get deep
For the love of that Benji, we spillin' blood in them streets
And I know why they hate me, it ain't no love in them streets
He was hinting at work, we thought it was love it was cheap
He was sellin us that reerock, pumping us on that Reebok
Damn, thought you was all here, found out that we not
Slid up on him wit three Glocks, did him dirty for three blocks
Turn that boy to a freeze pop, shoot 'em until it decock
It's a dog-eat-dog environment
Young niggas killing, all the old heads retiring
And the sound of that 30 start to sound inspiring
When you pull up on them, I start firing
Please don't judge us, they done killed our brothers
We done starved all winter they gon feel our summers
I went drop top Dawn on 'em, we do numbers
And when we get a chance to rain on 'em, we gon' flood 'em
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em

[Chorus]
I told 'em, I'mma pray for 'em
All that drama I feel like I'm made for
Catch a body, take it to the grave for me
And if they pop you off, you'll never change on me, no
Bag talk, put a bag on her, let that cash talk
Daddy was arrested so itâ€™s dad's fault
Killed the niggas about you, you tell them that part?
Why you take it that far?
[?] everybody, you gotta understand, dog
We the type to call the opps and have a standoff
Make a thottie call your homie, that's a man-off

[Verse 2]
We ain't never been loved, so we don't know how it feel
They so used to the fake shit, they don't know what was real
All my enemies, frenemies, I don't know who to kill
I don't know who gon' keep it silent and know who gon' squeal
I can't tell no more
I don't know who was thurl
'Cause it all got fuzzy and came down to that money
I seen niggas eatin' from me, made me watch while I'm hungry
Bitches changed for the fame, you gotta watch them they phony
I don't know where I'm going, I need navigation
They came and got a young niggas 'for they graduation
Spent some time on that Patek still ain't got no patience
Gave my nigga 20 years, put him on vacation
Every time I'm in the hood, I be on some Wraith shit
Stars all in the ceiling, feel like it's a spaceship
In them streets, we still in there, niggas think we made it
They just killed my little cousin, wish I could've saved him
'Member times out in Vegas when we did it major
Niggas turned they back on us, I feel like they played us
I feel like they try to use us, I can't do no favors
Gotta watch these niggas close 'cause they been catchin' vapors
