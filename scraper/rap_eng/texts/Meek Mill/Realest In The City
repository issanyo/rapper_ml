[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Sauga City trip one time…

[Verse 1: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
On my way downtown for the girl who got the guarantee
Man I kill the town, seven seater in the Cherokee
White on white ghost, thats my little Amber Rose
Let the top peel back, let ‘Sauga see the mack
Little shawty from the way used to have a thing for me
Take the bricks up out the Benz, now the whole team straight
We ain’t speaking for the city, we just talking bout the block
Yeah the whole team hot, yeah the whole team hot
And you know it, its paper, we blow it
Those niggas I roll with they got the thing for the 40
Okay, we riding through (yeah) That’s what you ‘posed to do (yeah)
When you the realest…

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
I wouldn't say realest nigga alive
But I don’t know none of these guys
The realest niggas in the city
These bitches there, they rolling with me
The realest niggas in the city
Wouldn't say the realest motherfucker alive
But I don’t really give a fuck about those guys (oh yeah)

[Verse 2: P. Reign]
Raising hell when I wrote this in the cell and posted bail
Man my boy just got convicted for a M and got an L
When yo mama got a rap sheet as long as yours you know its real
Got a package through the mail
Whipped that then sold it to the mayor
I turn peasants into kings, I made winners out of losers
Say you love me, better suck me, I turn women into Hoovers
Praise the Lord, hallelujah, Jesus pieces from the jeweler
Hate me, screw ya
Bitch I started as your favorite rapper shooter
(Brap, Brap, Brap)
It’s cold in the city, roll with a milli
Grind on 10, be home in a minute
Rap so long I could blow any minute
Just met a new chick that’ll blow if I’m with it
Ride for the Reps, dirty money baby life is a mess
No ice on ya chest, I can tell why you’re stressed
But I’m busy getting paid, I connect your connects

[Chorus]
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
I wouldn't say realest nigga alive
But I don’t know none of these guys
The realest niggas in the city
These bitches there, they rolling with me
The realest niggas in the city
Wouldn't say the realest motherfucker alive
But I don’t really give a fuck about those guys (oh yeah)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
This right here that trill shit, this that shit the hoes like
This that make that mill shit, counting paper for the whole night
This that take yo girl shit, California was a long flight
Rodeo Drive spent 85 on my day one’s, they loaded twice
To be blessed by the best, 3 guns nothing less
We on, fuck the best and all my niggas want the check
The money and power plus the respect
And I promise nothing less
I’m repping my team, I put my whole hood on this cream
They gotta fuck with that,  word up, we the

[Chorus]
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
The realest niggas in the city
I wouldn't say realest nigga alive
But I don’t know none of these guys
The realest niggas in the city
These bitches there, they rolling with me
The realest niggas in the city
Wouldn't say the realest motherfucker alive
But I don’t really give a fuck about those guys (oh yeah)

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Uh, uh, uh

We the, we the realest niggas
Realest motherfucker alive
