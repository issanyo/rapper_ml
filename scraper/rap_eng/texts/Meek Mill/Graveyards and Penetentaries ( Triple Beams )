My [?] with you man, you in a hell of a position
You really got to understand your position
You've got an opportunity to really, really truly become one of the biggest multi-millionaires to come out of the city this particular era
And the only person man, can make you fall that particular place, is yourself
You can't rely on outside man shit to effect you
Shit that you don't have no control, it should never effect you

[Meek Mill]
Feel like I lost my soul, selling Os fucking hoes in the dope game
And we did it all double cross, triple cross for the love of the cocaine
The triple beams, put me in these Balmain jeans
