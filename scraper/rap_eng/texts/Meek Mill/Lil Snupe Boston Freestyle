[Lil Snupe]

Aye, aye
Look, look
Catch me by 10 months i'm walking in this bitch with a million
Bout 10 cuban links
Its gone be hard for you to blink
Cuz imma be shining like a motherfucker
Perfect timing "how you get all that shit"
This shit is for grinding like a motherfucker
Old niggas finna played
Cuz the young nigga, he hit the stage
All the bitches holla "hooraye"
They say goddamn this nigga is winning
What so fucking funny this shit right here the beginning

[Meek Mill]

Where you at?

[Lil Snupe]

I'm in boston right now
This my first time up in Boston
But I'm balling like Rondo
Buy a fucking condo
Nigga I ball hard like Chris Bosh in Toronto
Nigga playing games
We hit yo ass with that combo
My nigga they be getting it, killing it
I'm just serious
My nigga we be coming out
These pussy niggas is curious
You know how we kill him
You know how we kill him

[Meek Mill]

Rap for you Grandma one time

[Lil Snupe]

Man, my grandma dead
Man, my grandma died today
I ain't gone lie, cried in a minute
But i cried today
I woke up this morning looking at the texts
I say Goddamn its my flesh
Looked I had no bitch
Mega damn my head was mess

I said what the fuck
I called my granny up
My other granny she was crying
I say goddamn these people dying
What the fuck am I going through
Nigga do my thing
But I just know I got the angels watching me chasing my dreams

I be killing this shit
Ain't stopping on these niggas
I don't hate on nobody
And I ain't blocking on these niggas
I do my own thing
I ain't watching on these niggas
I got my own bitches
I ain't knocking on these niggas

[Part 2]

Just killed this shit in Boston
You know what's up
Big boy say, Tak
Tak, boy say now i'm in East Coast, West Coast
Looking at the bad bitches smoking on the best smoke
Bitches say i'm too high
Living the life of Biggie and 2Pac
Nigga you know who shot
The day Jay Z go broke nigga when Snupe stop
That will be never bitch, i'm only getting better
Plus a nigga bout whatever, I'm a trend setter
Man It's cold out here but i'm surviving in this weather
I knew that I'd make it out one day
Rapping or Trapping it was going be one way
Before this Rap shit, we was bout gun play
Now in a year i can see me on rip the one way
Stunning with my niggas, stacking money like Lego
Nigga trying get the money just like i'm Diego
Me and all my niggas we play with money like play-doh
I don't fuck these bitches, I learnt that shit from a fake hoe
These hoes we trynna get it, lost my respect
Stupid ass bitch tried to fuck me for a cheque
Nigga these bitches know better I don't pay for fucking sex
You should just know that shit, that some shit I don't expect
What's the fucking deal for real
Boy I got the diamonds on, got them the chills
I'm smoking on this shit, this got me high as a hill
I'm going hard, man I'm rolling like i'm on off a pill
Man that Nigga Meek Milly ran out Bugatti
Can't wait that I wake up in a new Bugatti
Pull out with a bad ass bitch right beside me
She gone hop in, ride on it like Maserati, Kawasaki, Cali...
