[Intro: Rick Ross]
Real talk
So when my nigga Meek caught his case, I went to visit him
I'm walking up to the jail, all the niggas start repping
Beating on glass, kicking the doors, and shit
So when I walk through the door
The captain tell me, "You can't come in here"
Okay, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block
I heard him all the way from down the hallway
My nigga had on yellow Balenciagas, ha ha ha ha

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah
I bet they say, "He put his niggas on"
Now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Corners wanna check him like Odell Beckham
I could plan a record or just draw the weapon
She know I'm livin' reckless lookin' at my necklace
I'ma blow this .40 on me, you can save the lectures
Homicides rise as the sun falls
Watch your dog die as my gun bark
These helicopters rise for the one in charge
If I sentence you to die, well that's a hundred shots
Judge bangin' like a blood, show a nigga love
Caught him with a kilo so he hit him with a dub
We bulletproof the trucks like the ones in Iraq
Where I'm at, you lock your door and you usin' a latch
Now it's stones on my hands, Roberto Durans
Stood tall in the feds, don't fold on the fam
Tryna point me to the money, no holdin' my hand
Somebody take me to the bank 'cause it open at ten

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, uh
Poverty stricken, boy, you gotta be kiddin'
Livin' like we hit the lottery, nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag, I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident, all these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stopin' it, get off my dick, nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that? Real nigga, roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talkin' to the law, knowin' that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Benny Boom
Started out with nothin', now a nigga in a room
Sweepin' rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G, bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers, nigga, I could never lose

[Interlude: Anthony Hamilton]
I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up (So high)
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors (Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You bangin' on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm steppin' through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rollin' a wood leaf
Phone ringin', smilin' like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick out in DC out on the NorthEast (Trel!)
Such a feelin', niggas killin' for my poetry (boss)
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me (boss)
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny (never)
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your weddin' vows
I still be makin' rounds like I'm Kevin Liles (what up)
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out (bring it)
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me steppin' out

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah
I bet they say, "He put his niggas on"
Now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
