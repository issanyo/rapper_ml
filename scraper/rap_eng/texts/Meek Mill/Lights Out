[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, this that "just got to a half a brick" music
Young nigga, putting lobster in the Oodles of Noodles

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We never live for tomorrow, new half a brick in the car
Rich and my chick is a star, I never wish on a star
Pull up and sit on the car, 'member when we used to starve
Most of these niggas is frauds, they not who they said that they are
Niggas do it for the Internet
We ain't really really into that
Push a foreign but you rented that
Shoot a scene, gotta give it back
Took a loss on a lil cash
I ain't trip about it, had to get it back
Move work like SlimFast
Niggas in and out it with a fifty pack
Plugged in with the plugs, spikes on with the blood
Fell back, got the Balmains 'cause the pockets only fit a dub
That was never what it was, I'ma tell it like it is
Bust down with the sig, whole gang with me on the way to LIV

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 2: Don Q]
Every nigga with me iced out
Diamonds dance when the lights out
I just upgraded my lifestyle
Overnight and they like, "How?"
I treat my whip like a pet
I step on the gas and you hear the pipes growl
I got like twenty on me at the car wash
Got the Benz getting wiped down
Diss records, keep my name out it
I promise you won't get no fame out it
Driving by certain trap houses
Reminiscing when I used to sling out it
My life was excitin', all of this ice on
You catch me in Dyckman, I make it look easy
They hate when they see me, I'm high on the Deegan
I'm speeding with Meeky and chasing the 'ghini
When you broke, you just feel abandoned
Crowd screaming and I hear 'em chant
Watch me steer the Phantom when I'm in the Hamptons
Same crew since when I was wearin' Vans
It's show time when the gang appearin'
Niggas hating but the bitches starin'
Who would think that I'd get a mansion?
Twenty chains in the mirror dancin'

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
New crib with the elevator
I got hella haters and they mad at me
Up in Niemans, going bad at it
Count it up like it was mad madness
'Member back when I was dead pop
Pretty bitches used to laugh at us
Now I pull up in the red drop
With the thirty on me and the red dot
And I lean on 'em when I come through like, "Swerve" (Skrt Skrt)
Rat niggas up the street, shit, I'm like, "They got some nerve"
Every nigga 'round me look like they got them birds
Bust down, Big Meech, nigga, we ain't sweet beef, we purge

[Verse 4: Don Q]
I bet your manager know me, I used to run in them spots
We was just punching the last four, you was just punching the clock
I just got rid of my last whore, then I gave her mother a shot
Pour up, I'm down to my last four, and I fill my cup to the top
To my hood, I'm an icon, watching out for the pythons
10K on the left wrist, another dub on my right arm
I still come and spend nights on corners niggas took lives on
And they ain't lackin', believe me, they packin'
My youngins, they keeping they pipes drawn

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
When I walk up in this bitch, they turn the lights out
All the young niggas with me and they iced out
I had to stack it up and get my mom a nice house
I could've did the Wraith, instead I brought the bikes out, yeah
