[Intro: Meek Mill]
It's Team Pyrex over here
You know how we do it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, in the kitchen going H.A.M again
Fucking with them birds like Cam and them
I'll tell you what's the word when the tan is in
We them niggas on the curb with them hammers in, ah!
Whole brick, throw it on the triple beam
If it get hectic, we gon' stretch it like a limousine
Ain't no crutchin', if I touch it then it's Mr. Clean
I be reppin' in your section, me and my nigga Dean
Ghost boy in the ghost, nigga
I burn bread, I ain't talking toast, nigga
Whole team of killers, I'm the coach Digger
Presidential on my wrist now take your votes, nigga
Rookie of the year, cookies in the rear
I got some bad bitches that will get it there
If you don't wanna get it we gon' send them there
If it's heavy then Omelly comin' in the lear
Brick Squad like Waka and them
If it's Gucci like D. Howard I get a block for them
I don't touch it I just leave it up to Tak and them
Niggas started, was a drought but we was poppin' then

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I made a million off a mixtape, nigga get your shit straight
I'm selling that raw shit, you sellin' that whip weight
Cookin' up a whole bird until I make my wrist ache
When I pulled up to the club you should've seen your bitch face
Ugh, fifty cash in my pocket
Nigga, I got your stash in my pocket
I'm blowin' money fast in my pocket
I said it's lookin' like I got Nicki ass in my pocket
Talkin' "ass, ass, ass, ass" all I get is cash, cash
Club LIV my last tag, I could've bought a fast Jag
The way these bitches waving at me you would think a cab past
No wonder why you hatin' on me nigga wit' your mad ass
Rollie on me cost a whole brick
Killers with me ain't got no pics
These groupie bitches ain't got no sense
So we make a movie on them bitches, no script

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
36 treat it like a dirty bitch
‘Cause I hit it then I send it to the other strip
Call me anything, don't call me by my government
‘Cause when I'm out here in the jungle we be selling bricks
Half these niggas in my hood be on some tellin' shit
We be on some "if-u-snitchin'-crack-your-melon" shit
If I ain't rockin' with the Smith it's Parabellum shit
Papi bring them on the boat, he know we selling shit
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it, posted Mac 11 in the lot wit' it
750 getting busy wit' a box in it
So when they pull us over they don't find them Glocks in it

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
I tell them lean wit' it, rock wit' it
Throw some bake up in the pot wit' it
Microwave or we gon' pot whip it
When it get right, we drop that ice and make it lock wit it
