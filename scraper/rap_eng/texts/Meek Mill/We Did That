[Intro: Meek Mill]
See what it is you niggas be talking that shit we really be doing
We really living that life y'all niggas be acting like on Instagram

[Hook: Meek Mill]
G5 we did that, Rolex we did that
Every foreign we did that, them niggas we been that
Word up, tell a bad bitch roll up
Thirty six we did that, thirty rounds it's on the get back
Young niggas gon' hit back, in this life you don't live that
Word up, my young niggas murder

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Flipping bricks we did that, flicka of the wrist I lived that
You better get your boo because she acting crazy
You ain't getting her back once I hit that
I was selling the dope shit when I was broke
Keep them clappers on us when we fall in the Ghost
I'm in a foreign and I'm smoking on reefer
Fuck on your hoe one time I don't need her
Fifty in the glizzy fuck with any Chaser know I'm getting busy
Osama Twin Llama know to [?] a chopper 'til it's empty
Flooded out my Rollie got my shorty rolling she don't even smoke
Y'all ain't seen me in a while I was in the trenches I've been flipping work
Hopping out a Rarri' jumping on the jet it's only right I flex
Any nigga diss my squad shit I'm right at niggas neck
We got big time [?] and they paid off
War time we letting K's off
If beef come we handle that and when it come to my niggas I don't play dawg

[Hook: Meek Mill]
G5 we did that, Rolex we did that
Every foreign we did that, them niggas we been that
Word up, tell a bad bitch roll up
I say Thirty six we did that, thirty rounds it's on the get back
Young niggas gon' hit back, in this life you don't live that
Word up, my young niggas murder

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
If y'all got hittas and I got hittas we can call 'em up and get down to
Y'all got pistols and we got pistols only difference is a hundred rounds
Calling shots they gon' spin your corner on a quiet day and bring sound to it
Pull up on ya playing my shit but all you gon' hear is four pound music
My nigga we ready we ready we ready my niggas so ready as fuck
My nigga we heavy we heavy these Cubans heavy as fuck
When I'm in the jungle I might do the Bentley and Chevy the truck
I pop on a wheelie just me and Omelly, Omelly what up
They ain't seen a nigga this live since Meech was home in BMF
Put a line at the front since your bitch came you ain't seen her yet
Cause she wide open like CVS
