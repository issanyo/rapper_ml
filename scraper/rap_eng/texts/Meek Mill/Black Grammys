[Intro: Rick Ross]
If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this ma'fucka
I'm just talking to you ma'fuckas
If I don't make you niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I groom better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too official
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, lil nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though, try to hit the Jummah
Muhammed said you faking, though
Somebody said "you winning, why BOA pray so much?"
I say "you tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us"
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never ending revenue hunt

[Interlude: Wale]
Folarin in this motherfucker

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'mma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat
You get that? Look like I went diamond where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit Kat, pause
Let me get that, aw, how you get that far
Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to look that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18 when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferrari's just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mill, then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Give these fuck niggas some fame
9 times out of 10 they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don’t be a statistic
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah, nigga I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If you're a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight, I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young C.O.L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, oh, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot, Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a helluva start

Cole... World... nigga
Double M-G, Dreamville shit

[Hook: Wale]
