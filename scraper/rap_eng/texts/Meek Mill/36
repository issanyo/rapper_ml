They know who I am, they know who I be
If it ain't about money, then it ain't about me

Dollar dollar bills, dollar dollar dollar bills
Dollar dollar bills, dollar dollar dollar bills

The numbers don't lie, neither do the scale
Bitch I hustle hard, everything for sale
I'm dope boy, that's in the dope game
I take a half, break and turn into a whole thing

36, I got 36 ols, the numbers don't lie, I got 36
36, I got 36 ols, the numbers don't lie, I got 36

So fuck being broke, I'm trynna make it rich
I'm talking birthday cake bitch make a wish

I'm my whip game poppa got a magic wrist
And its 45 cal bliss, you gotta let it clip
I leave half soft, but let the rest cook
Now watch a nigga ball, bitch I'm Russell Westbrook

All black shades, I'm in a black beamer
I'm on 95, I'm riding with Christina
I'm 'bout to take her home, soon as the door open
I take her clothes off and make that bitch bust it open

I break a bitch down into a bunch of docks
So come and get a point, before I sell' em out
I'm no Jay-Z, but I'm selling rock
36 ols, and choppers know exactly what I'm talking 'bout

The numbers don't lie, neither do the scale
Bitch I hustle hard, everything for sale
I'm dope boy, that's in the dope game
I take a half, break and turn into a whole thing

36, I got 36 ols, the numbers don't lie, I got 36
36, I got 36 ols, the numbers don't lie, I got 36

Look, I got 36 ols, 36 tools

I make that dirty bitch roll winner
When it come over my table
Just tell'em 36 rules

I'll be balling on this niggas call a time out
Bout to buy a bird, so I can take a fucking 9 out
Put another 9 in, escape'em flow I'm grindin
When they let me in, her daughter let her fucking bomb it

Hey niggas make me sick, thug
Wiz Khalifa on you bitch, roll up
White Maserati which your ride
Right beside me you became a homesick til you crip, rolla
With my bitch, whit my staff, I'm like he gonna whoop your ass
All the selling is ready rock
With a drive-through you are goona get that fast

20 shots that diddy em rock it, stones
Got a pay full in my pocket
And this office sell, ain't hard to tell

The numbers don't lie, neither do the scale
Bitch I hustle hard, everything for sale
I'm dope boy, that's in the dope game
I take a half, break and turn into a whole thing
