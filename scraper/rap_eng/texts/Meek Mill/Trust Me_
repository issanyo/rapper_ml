[Chris Brown]
Every time I go, they keep telling me no
And life's travelling fast all around you, whispers about my past
I can tell you anything I want
But I'd rather rewrite my wrongs if I'm allowed to
So let me know if you can trust me
If you can trust me, then trust me
If you can trust me baby
If you can trust me, then trust me

[Rick Ross]
Sipping purple and I'm leaning
My bitch we up at Neimans
Still triple beam dreaming
I'mma show these hoes the meaning
Alone in the palace its just me and all the choppers
But I know they got us all these haters out here plotting
