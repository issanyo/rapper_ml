[Meek Mill]
I been, I been looking on the motherfuckin’ internet
And I been seeing a lot of niggas on Gram with fake busted ass things
If you from Philly
And you rep for Meek Milly, make some fuckin’ noise
You don’t wanna see my Philly niggas hanging out the window
Like we’re tryna spot Ricky
And shout out to the niggas that showed me they not with me
Shit, I don’t think it’s bout no rapping, it’s about Nicki
He told us he was first in line but it got tricky
I still wake up with the lady that you said you first in line with
Did five months, came home, that’s perfect timing
To make a sucka nigga look sucka without trying
If Quentin Miller wrote that shit, why were we buying?
Might as well go and get his tape, is he good or is he great?
Niggas turn to hoes, Caitlyn Jenners turn to Drizzy Drakes
Woah shit, we in Philly right?
See I represent the niggas that come from the bottom
If you started from nothing, make some fuckin' noise in this bitch
I said when I first seen my homie sitting in the casket
Is when I first went to get the ratchet
Shit is real, the fuckin' crackers itching to do me like Emmett Till
And I can smell death in the air and you the kill
When you was still out in the field toting them Glocks
Man, he was still with wheelchair Jimmy rolling them blocks
My momma used to hold them Berettas when it was hot
Your momma used to peek out the window and call the cops
And the nerve of y’all niggas, saying y'all started from the bottom
When the real niggas dying, cops killing, metal flying
All that bullshit you selling, real niggas never buy
Uh, I got word from the six, niggas say you testified
When they ran up on you…
Fuck knows how many I got
Let's turn up, we in fuckin' Philly, let's get it
