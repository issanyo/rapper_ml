[Lyrics from Snippet]

Back to back like Money May and I'm steady rolling
Back to back in that Bach and I'm strapped with that clapper on me
32 and the nigga running
Itchy fingers I shoot it like I was Stephen Curry
These niggas pussy and in their feelings like February
The fourteen, ever since they murk Chinx I've been rolling...

Back to back
I got Nicki know they mad at that
When I'm riding pump these niggas like an asthma attack
Cause when we run into them ain't no pass for that
I don't want to hear niggas talking Nicki again
[?] Rozay brought [?] again...

...cracking
We was in the clubs we was getting these brackets
Ducking Chris Brown you was missing in action
And I was like damn how you getting in past him...
