[Intro: 5PM]
If he don't hit it right shawty you can call me
See I know what to do with all that in them jeans
He got a little swag he ain't nothing like me
Shawty I know what to do with all that in them jeans

[Hook: 5PM]
Shawty know she got a bad body 36-24-36
Damn right baby you a hotty, and girl I really need to know what's up
Shawty know she got a bad body 36-24-36
Damn right baby you a hotty, and girl I really need to know what's up

[Verse 1: K Smith]
Hey ma I love how your clothes skin tight like a baby fit
Word to life you the type to have a baby with
You half white so your hair got the wavy dip
But you mixed with black too so you crazy thick
When we met you was hella down
And that's why I took you out them clear diamonds to them yellows now
We on a whole 'nother level now
And plus your head so right you make a youngin want to settle down
Hey don't trip when I grind here
Because I got a stack so you fall back like a reclined chairs
I can see you trying to sell through that blue c
Her in a new V playing with her new seat
You got a cold wrist showing off the new freeze
Forget the old whip come and get the new keys
Show them how I do please I make it rain in your crib ma
K will have you feeling like a [?]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said shawty what it is tell me what it do
You got such a bad body I could put it on you
You should thank the lord God bless them like achoo
36-24-36 you're 22?
Shining like a diamond gleeming, caught me when I seen her
And the next thing you know we was in and out of Neiman's
Girl that head so good I would've thought you was a genius
I served it like I was Venus
She hit it back like Serena
I might tuck her like Chris I ain't ever seen a hotty with a body like this
Like her's nice curves pretty face like word
She throw it at me I catch it like Mike Irv-
Shawty you could have the cover shot
Something that I love a lot I could put you in another spot
Sit you in a bubble drop turn you into a superstar
Have you fly shining harder than a shooting star

[Bridge: 5PM] (x2)
See your the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world
I'll do anything if you be my girl
So don't say no give me a try
Cause I'm gonna love you for the rest of my life
