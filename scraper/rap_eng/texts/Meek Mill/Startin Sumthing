[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Starting something (x4)
Yeah yeah (x7)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I like the way I spit the game I ain't talking
Rather pull up in the Bent moon walking
Biddies checking out my swag when I walk in
Cause I'm fresh to death like a nigga in the coffin
I'm screaming rest in peace to Mike
When I step up out the booth they should've rest in peace the mic
Cause a lot of niggas spit they'll never be this nice
If they try to take them left they'll never be this right, no
Keep it real too hot
I'm like a little Biggie mixed with 2Pac
I'm like a little Nas mixed with a Jay-Z
I'm spitting like a Mac mixed with a K
Cook crack bring it back like that
Tell Rugg stop the beat like it had a heart attack
I go into cardiac with a flow like woah
And I'm still young like Chris, Jeezy, Dro
Let Wheezy know, I ain't dead I'm alive
And I'm in the lead too
He be Jordan I'm Lebron
I be on it all the time niggas off like a light switch
Hop up on the track going wild like a white bitch
I just beat the beat like a copper with a nice stick
Know it always got to be a hater,"I don't like this"
Nigga you know you don't like shit
I got the game on lock like a vice grip
People say I'm doing good I just tell them that I'm trying
Cross me leave a nigga mom frying
Lot of rappers they really be lying
And I'm the truth, tell 'em Mike

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Wrist looking like Mike Jack jacket
VVS is like lights camera action
Real talk, wasn't for the rapping
I be in the hood having birdies with a ratchet
Whole strip got money like parkway
And the boardwalk [?]
School of hard knocks I was in the hallways
Getting to the money like everyday all day
I ain't do my homework had my own work
My nigga [?] show me how the [?] work
One-two-three shit I was in the zone first
Any chick I ever touch gave me dome first
Believe that, give me feedback
Fresh [?] my nigga be back
Tell 'em we back where the keys at
In the hood flipping like a dirty kid with three [?]
People say I'm getting money I just tell them that I'm trying
I should bring a bitch hard have her [?]
Have her knocking at my door spying
Tell 'em Mike

[Hook]

[Interlude]
You're A Vegetable, You're A Vegetable
Still They Hate You, You're A Vegetable
You're Just A Buffet, You're A Vegetable
They Eat Off Of You, You're A Vegetable

[Outro]
We had the Ros√© with the Nuvo (x4)
If you a hustler throw some money up
If you a hustler (x2)
Now ladies if you getting money
Let me see you drop down, drop down (x2)
All my hustlers throw your bankrolls up
All my ladies put your Louis bags up (x2)
Put your Louis bags up (x2)
Right now right now
All my hustler put your bankrolls up
Right now right now
Tell security they better fall back (x4)
What you looking at what you hating for (x4)
