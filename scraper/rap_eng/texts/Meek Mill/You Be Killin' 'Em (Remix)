(Verse 1)

I said shawty mind clear with the jewels drippin' off em
She say I be killin' em
I say get a coffin
Stuntin I be often
They like "What it cost him?"
Whole team fulla green you would think we Boston
Swollen, Ballin
Flow be on the faucet
Middle man shut yo damn mouth call a boss in
Big money on the table nigga why you talkin
Black and yellow 'maro, murder scene, caution
Tape, scrape, all I get is hate
Chillin' in the mansion, all you see is gate
She say that I'm handsome she thinking 'bout a date
But I'm just tryna take her home I'm thinking bout a "safe"
I was just booked they had me bidding in the pen house
Couple months later now I'm sittin in the penthouse
Bitches fuckin' everywhere you thinking it's a pimphouse
Engineer lookin' when that boy gon' pull his pen out
No pen no pad
This shit so sad
Dippin in the Aston
This bitch so fast
This bitch so bad
I treat her so nice
I came so fast
I had to go twice
Rob me, no dice
Better get your dope slice
Puffin on the diesel gettin higher than the coke price
Nigga, you a rat, you a talkin to them folks type
I'm more like the bull that could get 'em by the bow type
This be- homicide
All black whipped you would think it's on my side
I'mma get money laid back kinda guy
If you dead broke, nigga why you mindin mine?
Yah, you gettin paid for this shit?
I dont needa see the work I'm gettin paid by the bricks
Ciroc and lemonade in the shade with your bitch
She sent you straight to the voicemail
Shame on your bitch

(Chorus)
You wussup girl
I gotta ask you
If you suckin would you eat the nut?
Cashews
I'm countin money so you know I'm good at math boo
She frontin' on you tryna cover up yo' tattoos
Girl why you killin him?
She tryna go at me
I'm tellin' her to deal with him
And if you notice me
Then you will see some will in him
Rocks in the bezzle
Bigger then some M&m's, HA!

(Verse 2)

High school I was ballin, Reese Rice
....................................
I hustle all day I don't even eat right
Cause Im just tryna get a ticket no police light
That's a milli bitch
I'm on that Philly shit
And I'm just tryna make a movie like I'm Willy Smith
Come to my hood, show you how real it gets
Niggas thats padlocked tell you that they feelin this

(Outro)

It's Meek Milli bitch!
Philly!
I swear to god
Ain't no competion and I dont even own a composition
You wassup girl, I gotta ask you, if you suckin
Would you eat the nut?
Cashews! Haha!
Real talk though, no pen no pad flow
Shit is so sad tho
It's your boy Meek Milli signin' the fuck out
We make movies- bitch!
