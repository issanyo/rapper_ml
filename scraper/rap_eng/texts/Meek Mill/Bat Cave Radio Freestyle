I tell em, I say
One yourself when 2 niggas run up with 3 gats
A four, five, six shots, seven like eight claps
Da nine milli throw ten shots where ya face at
And the MAC 11 tucked in where da 12 gauge at
When I was 13 had 14 grams of ajax
Turned 15 start spitting 16s of straight crack
By 17, 18th street where I played that
19 niggas on the corner with 20s and they strapped
Playin with my money like playin with my emotions
Floatin off that water like I'm layin in da ocean
Roastin, I make you disappear, hocus-pocus
We leave these suckas like they Jerry Rice, wide open
In da field to get real, ya block slow-motion
And the bills rollin in just like a coasta
Gotta catch a nigga sleepin late night, stick em with the toaster
Make him put it all in like he was playin poker
Cause I remember days, nights, I couldn't even think right
Niggas gettin murked out I'm clutchin on that thing tight
I wouldn't even blink like
Blink once, blink twice
Cause that'd get ya life snatched
Faster than a Tyson match
Pull up to the scene
So fresh, so clean
In a 7-4 pound, with the windows rolled down
Like 20 on my neck, feel like the king, no crown
I be Prada down enough and all my year be low down
Red horse, red stripes
Red porshe, red lights
Tell me stop cause I'm killin em
Got chains like a millions
Lames they not feelin em, but tell em keep hatin
Praying on my downfall, tell em keep waitin
I be here, I be there
Wear them rocks on rocawear
I'm so fly without no leer
Why would I lie? No I don't care
I ride that fire without no fear, keep that choppa on deck
If a hater run up on me hit him up with no rat
It's big business, big bills, and big choppas
Cherry red Challenger, lookin like a lobster
All blacks D's on it, hoes holla
Slidin through your area
Why is they comparin us?
Serious, numbers on my check look like a serial
And I still got the block jumpin, Shawn Marion
I said a hater disrespect me then I'm airin em
He don't dig me where I from we just bury em
We count money, fuck bitches, go super hard
Maybach, layed back, looking like a super star
Diamonds on my neck, shining on em like a shooting star
30 in the clip it's got me feeling like a shooting guard
Stop me, small but I'm cocky
2 40s give a sucka 80 like Shockey
Pull up in the hood 4 door Mazeradi
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi
Copy, I be probably in the hills out in Cali
In the million dollar crib eatin on shrimp and brocolli
Watch me, Pilladels Flyer, no hockey
Tell your chick to google me, she can dot com me
She ain't gotta chase me, just tell her myspace me
And maybe she can find me, so I can get behind it
Heard I got a deal so now she joe me like sloppy
Got the goons on deck, they ride hard like Kowazakis
They ride hard, I said they ride hard
I say we be the freshest
Jury be VVSes
Kated by DTSes
Like Khalid shit we the best and
I tell em hoes I don't wanna talk, just leave a message
Automatic stash boxes so they can see the weapons
But I be DC reppin, Grand Hustle the muscle
No me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em
I just ah, no me don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck em

Let me keep it clean, holdup what I say?
I said, I said, said
I got money on my mind, change on my membrane
Insane, in the kitchen with it got the whip game
Similar to Gordon, throw it in the pyrex
Like can I get your order? Ounces to the quarter
Omelly pushed the rock, I pushed the haze power forward
20s have a niggas floatin like he in the water
Sure ya, we got bundles for a Goya
A bean my nigga, if you need I get it for ya
This sawyer on my hip, tinted in the rora
Bad lil chick with me, looking like Kimora
Lead that's me in the pocketbook to yora
Long pretty hair ass juicy and Coutura
20s, 50s, hundreds, nigga that's all up in my money grip
We chewin like it's double mint
That 40 got a double clip
Automatic magnum like a condom with a rubber grip
And these suckas step up out of line and we gon fuck em up
I hug that strip, on the block, with that Yao Ming
Those oh-yous put them on a higher plain like Al Green
Now I mean, ay ay, they hear when I talk
Got that white girl and that green lady like Fairmount park
And this nigga think he G, I bet he fear when I spark
Put some hot shit in his tea, he be layin out, chalk
Where he at? There he go
Pull up on that nigga slow
Got that ruga clip like rula shootin like a video
And we be ridin, ridin, slippin, slidin
All through the city with that semi right beside him
Ballin like Jimmy, and that nigga try and try him
We catch em when they slippin, homicide em
I said now they start and stop and frisk us, niggas gettin childish
But really they ain't stoppin shit, that's just gon get a cop in here
We're competent, common sense, cause niggas, they rock this shit
From where they forever hate,you'll never get a compliment
I'd rather do a 5 to 10, nigga fore I lose my life
Go out in a blaze of glory, squezing with my trigga tight
Young loke, and gun smoke, and done choke, and nigga
Raised by the rat's roaches, real youngen holdin coke
State they gave my man life, Feds they gave my man 10
Messin with this dirty game feel like I'm on a dead end
Like damn where my nigga Rick
Damn where my nigga Brick
As time flies I think about you, know you tired and sick of it
Then they said my nigga snitched, I could neva see that
Talkin that they got statements on him, hold let me read that
Believe that
Was gettin high off of life, about to relapse
Gud gang, aka them Ladder boys, we back

We back
I ain't playin

I said
I don't make it rain, I ain't rich
I ain't got a milli, I ain't trynna chase a bitch
Yeah I got signed, but I ain't got them bricks
And I still step up in the club feelin like I'm Mitt
We got Squally in the building, he be there strapped
Omelly outside and he let out with the Mac
Me I'm in the crowd, just chillin fallin back
Peepin out the scene, I see a hater I react
Like you don't want no problems
We come with them choppas
They call us the Ladder Boys cause we get it poppin
We don't do no robbin, all we do is grind
Hustle from the muscle nigga, save up every dime
Everybody know I'm bout to blow like a bomb, boom
Pull up in the '96 Impala, vroom
Hammers in the stash box dirty, broom
The holster in the passenger, gansta, goon
Yeah I do my thang
Uh, I said, I said
Yeah I be on some shit, yeah I do my thang

I ain't gon give em that, Imma let Raw give em that man
I do my thang man, shout out to my boy Oskee
My boy Oskee, my boy Oskee

Hold on, hold up
I said, they gave my nigga 20 years, man that wasn't even right
Got him in the Hell hole, livin at the speed of light
Prayin that the time fly by so he can see the light
See his kids meet a wife, all over a key of white
But why you think they take that time from you, cause you need it right?
And you can't get it back, so how they givin people life?
Like you gon live again, grow up be a kid again
That's why I never waste time, I cherish every minute in
Pray that God faithful though
Man half that shit I make, I blow
I don't even take it slow
Cause any given day could go
And I could see my death date, feel my last breath take
That's why I go and get it now
I be like shit wait
Die young, and the bag don't even last that
Where the young niggas 16 and over die fast at
I was made there, raised there but moved past that
Livin at the speed of light, it looked like a flash back
I don got money, went broke then got the cash back
Had it I was cool though, lost it I got laughed at
That's why I never ever cherish nothin I can have back
Thankful for my life though, I wish I could stash that
Shit I'm just livin at the speed of light
Ballin hard to see the light
Be here today, to cease tonight
I just hope when God come arrest me that he read my rights, read my wrongs, ah

Rest in peace to Shotty too man.  Rest in peace all my boys man
Free the whole State Road.  Man, when you get out here man, all my boys that's booked, man when you get out here do

Your thing man
Jail ain't for nobody man. It's Meek Milli, I'm in the building, Bad K studio man, Flamerz
All day. Y'all want some more?

I say, hold up I'm on my grind

And I won't 9 to 5 but you can get that 9 for 5
We got that ye, ay ay bae bae, come around my way
Everything be a-okay
Even quarters has some ozs niggas know we got that way
But ay ay ay
I remember dog we used to be slaves
Now we whip that white like it's Kuntakente
Ay, all we know is hustle get payed
Grind from the muscle just to lay up in the shade
Cause I'm the man in my city
And nobody fucking with me
I be rollin through your hood ridin shotty with the semi
They be rollin on that good, I be poppin on that henny
Ridin tinted in the SR, tu with that hemi
See that bad chick? That's all me I be in it
From the front and from the back
I say this and she do that
I step in, they like "Who dat?"
That's Meek Milli and them boys
Brought them choppas in the building we be really making noise
Said we be really making noise
We brought them choppas in the building we be really making noise, boy!
