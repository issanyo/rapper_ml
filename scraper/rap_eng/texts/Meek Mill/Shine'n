[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I said my niggas be rollin on sour sipping on champ (boss)
Cause it ain't shit but young bosses in my camp
Certified goon 100 on my stamp
Got the haters throwing shade cause I'm shining like a lamp
Shining like a lamp, sh-shining like a lamp
You see the haters throwing shade cause I'm shining like a lamps
Shining like a lamp, sh-shining like a lamp
Me and P-Mon in the caddy and we be sliding like a ramp[yeaa]
I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slangin sticky like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop the oils in the water and it just might

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slinging sticking like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop them oils in the water and it just might crack
Said it just mite snap, yea it jus mite jump
Shit I mite jus hit it hard and come up jus like luck
I got these bitches in my face and said they jus like bumps
So I pop them and watch them fade away at a player rage
I be a-ok kicking it like an 808 (kicking it)
Cause I get, if I dont got it I make a way
Natural born hustler, ever since a younging I been all about dat double up
Ya'll was playing double dutch, running with the girls I was
I was watching for the d-boys and how they make they sales
Now I do it well, I learned from the realest
If it ain't about no money then it ain't about me nigga
I gotta bop like this, can't wear skinny jeans cause my Glock won't fit
No one on the corner got a swagger like dis
When I step up in the hood I be good real shit
Jus me no goon, r/t go vroom, got them multi-colored diamonds looking like a cartoon
See them haters looking at me wanna stick me harpoon
But I'm strizzy with dat glizzy put nigga on snooze (sleep)
Fresh like Manny be, I said the rollie face blue like a zanny be
I'm here now, they like can he be? Flight attendants
With the haters had planned for me, more money is what the maker had planned for me
But I'm back and watch the whole hood chant for me, I'm back now watch the whole hood chant for me
But I'm back
