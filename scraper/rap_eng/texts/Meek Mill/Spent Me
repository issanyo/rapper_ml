[Hook: Lil Durk]
I got it when it was a drought
I got it when nobody tried
My niggas they counted me in
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
I had to get back on my shit I had to go and get it
Cause I do it for the trap niggas
I had to get back on my shit and go and get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I feel like I started this shit
Lil' Durk I'm the heart of this shit
Sosa Sosa Ressey Ressey me, I'm like Pac in this shit
It's my arrogance saying
T-Farris can't spend me, moon dawg can't spend me
And these others niggas spend me
Niggas ain't give me my fame
Niggas ain't saying my name
Think about taking my chain
Thinking that I was a stain
Look at me now, look at the clout
Look at my diamonds, look at my house
Look at my bitch, look at trap
Look at me now fuck nigga look at me now

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I got it when it was a drought
I got it when nobody tried
My niggas they counted me in
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
I had to get back on my shit I had to go and get it
Cause I do it for the trap niggas
I had to get back on my shit and go and get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Nigga counted me out, should've counted me in
Fuck up the count on the milli, fuck it we count it again
Niggas they never could kill me, I'm going out with the win
I'm going out with my 30, banging on you and your friend
Bending the corner just me and Omelly we riding the seven
I pull up on niggas they never could touch in bulletproof Caddies
I'm hitting up BB and I'm calling Lolo to bring through the ladders
They bend through your corner they hitting whoever it don't even matter
Creeping through my block I'm looking for my man
Pussy nigga made me go and spend a hundred grand
The type of murder that your mama wouldn't understand
I bring it to him brown bag with the rubber band

[Hook: Lil Durk]
I got it when it was a drought
I got it when nobody tried
My niggas they counted me in
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
I had to get back on my shit I had to go and get it
Cause I do it for the trap niggas
I had to get back on my shit and go and get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I was all in it when nobody cared
Chino [?] was there
Niggas around I know they ain't care
Hit the street with that rally on me
That pussy fucking go mileage on it
Every song every bar I'm spazzing on 'em
Daddy had told me behave myself
The streets and the hoes so he paid the debt
One thing had told me be real and be young nigga
Nigga was screaming to save yourself
In the hood with that gun up on me
Money, lean, and my son up on me
Watch out for the phony homie they money hungry
The hood and the ghetto they told me go get it
My mama and daddy had told me go get it
The niggas beside me told me go get it
Go get it while these fuck niggas gon' spend me

[Hook: Lil' Durk]
I got it when it was a drought
I got it when nobody tried
My niggas they counted me in
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
When everybody counted me out
I had to get back on my shit I had to go and get it
Cause I do it for the trap niggas
I had to get back on my shit and go and get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas
