[Intro]
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
And I’ll be on my way
Look, I’ma give you a tip
Never let nobody tell you what you can be
They told me I couldn’t
But I bet they told Obama he couldn’t be the president either

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Verse 1 : Meek Mill]
I look in the mirror, what do I see?
Like the letter after a, I'm all I could be
Bein’ a winner, that’s all I could see
Give me the ball, bet I score on all of they D
Wanted it bad, I was writing and falling asleep
I had to split it 50/50 not all in the streets, whether rapping'
Or trappin', whether trappin' or rappin'
I was making it happen with dreams of making it rappin'
I was makin’ some magic like some magician and rabbit
My position was heavy but I insisted I had it
I insisted I’d get it for me, my mom and my sister
Grindin’ and winnin’ and it’s just the beginnin’

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Verse 2]
I had a basketball dream they deflated
I wasn’t good as Michael Jordan so they faded
God dealt me my hand and I displayed it
Gave me a king of diamonds, I flip me an ace of spades
And that’s blackjack and bed scraps
Soon to be the great as I sat back and tack that
Did it for the haters
Man, I did it like the Lakers
Kobe and Phil Jackson
I’m independent as ever, them labels is still askin’
I didn’t believe they believed in me
'Cause where I’m from they all believed with me
So this the song I say
Yea, I be on my way
Yea, I be

[Chorus]
On my way, on my way
World tour, with 10.000 miles per hour
Tryna make it to the top from the bottom
On my way, on my way, on my way
I see them fans, everywhere I go I spot ‘em
They believed in me, so you know I got 'em
On my way

[Outro]
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
On my way
