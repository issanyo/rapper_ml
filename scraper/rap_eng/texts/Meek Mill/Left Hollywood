[Intro]
I had to get out of Hollywood
Get back to the trenches, they said they need me
Lil fish

[Verse 1]
I used to cop my little reggie tryna feed myself
My cousin had that work but I didn't need no help
Man I was so fucked up I couldn't believe myself
That's why I be at the jeweler tryna freeze myself
'Cause my heart so cold, we ain't got no goals
All these young niggas killin' like they ain't got no souls
Talkin' Grand Marquis, before I cop my Rolls
It was all so sweet until Dashawn told
Really hurt my heart, ripped my feelings apart
Out in Philly it's dark, we was really so scarred
But actin' silly so hard but we just wanted some love
Mama workin', daddy dead, I just wanted a hug
Why you think we spillin' spade when we go to the club
All my homies think I smoke, we just rollin' it up
I'm stressed out, niggas got Jordans, feel left out
So I went to chasin' them birdies, I went south, fuck it

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin' the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool

[Verse 2]
Uh
Caught my first case, it was me versus the state
I just wanted some steak and some food on my plate
Came up from shit I'm like "how can you hate?"
I'm just tryna be great!
I survived with the snakes
Look what they did to Lil Kodak and Gates'
I can't lose faith, I just want shine like the stars in my wraith
We go to war in fatigues like it's bape
I don't feel safe, can't sleep without it
Master with them P's yeah boy I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Brought me to my knees back when everybody doubted
Can't let my youngins see me fold, I'm too solid
If I stand on it, I'ma stand on it
Put some bags on the scale, put some grams on it
This the only shit I knew I seen my man done it
Tryna be like niggas who were never there for us
We ain't have no guidance

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool

[Verse 3]
Coppers scoopin' niggas out their radar
Niggas puttin' niggas in the graveyard
Jobs told us beat it like an A&R
So we play with heart, fuck it we gon' play it raw
Cut the lights, told my momma they ain't stayin' off
They killed my daddy and it turned me to a man, dog
We play with rugers, play with Glocks, we ain't playin ball
Shit we tryna stay alive it's a standoff
My life for your life
Go to war like we got like four lives
Talkin' before like, all this lil' rap shit
Where I'm from if you turn eighteen, then that's More Life
For real nigga

[Interlude]
When you have no voice
Ain't nobody hear us, so we ain't have no choice

[Chorus]
I went from goin' to school, to totin' them tools and makin' the moves
I said I would win, they said I would lose, shit
We're so confused, hope I don't make the news, oh Lord
We was breakin' the rules, trappin' to get some food
Risking freedom for shoes
Knowin' that I don't need em, I'm spending money on jewels
Jeweler like, "He's a fool"
They told us that this was cool
