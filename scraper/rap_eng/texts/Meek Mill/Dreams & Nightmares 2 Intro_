Fuck 'em, new jewelry, new whips on the way now

[Beat Switch]

Wins and losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us

Lil' bitch, you don't call me lil' fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, I'm still lit
Streets calling and they said they was some real shit
Young bull looking like he in a real lick

[Beat switch]
