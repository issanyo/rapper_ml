[Verse 1: Chip]
Okay I'm Lethal like Bizzle
Kick no Rizzle
Roll up a swish and put the green in the middle
I met your girl she was all up on a nigga
I don't even wanna fuck her I give her the finger fiddle
You hating on Chip? Up goes the middle
I can make it rain, leave you in a drizzle
Yeah I'm on a ball, yeah nigga dribble
Don't sleep on a brother bars wipe away the dribble
Yeah, I like girls and clubs
Step up in a party everybody show me love
Your ex left you empty? I can fill you up
On that note tell me baby girl where’s your cup
You know we nuh tek backchat
Fassi boy get one cap, snapback
All you do is act bad, triples can’t back that
Show up like the pizza boy, yo where the cash at?

[Hook: Chip]

And I got blood dripping all up on my sneakers, boy

If I ever eat your pussy shorty you might just be lucky
And I be fryin' chicken
Ain't been in no Kentucky
But I'm racing like a derby and it's 'Rari with the buggy
Eyes on it, murder my opponent
Tell a bad bitch fall through and hop on it
My whip like a stadium ain't got a top on it
And my wrist cost a bird you could put a block on it
Tell 'em Chip

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chip]
Oh, Aw yeah we getting dough
