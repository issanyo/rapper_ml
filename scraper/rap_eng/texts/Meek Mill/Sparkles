[Intro: DJ Drama]
I'm talking, I'm talking live on Sunday type sparkle
Nah mean, big money only

[Chorus: Young Pooh]
50 Bottles of Ciroc, tell the waiter to make it sparkle
50 Bottles of Rose, tell 'em bring the sparkles
50 karat diamond chains just to see it sparkle
When we love the actin', love that it look like a car show
Benzez Ferrari's Bentley to Lamborghini
Brand new Maserati photo action you never seen it
Riding European all my whips foreign
When we in the club bottles on deck keep it pouring

[Verse 1: Young Pooh]
Money is the topic ain't no option nigga I'm involved
Racks all in my pocket nigga I'm a show you how to ball
I'm spending so whats the cost so why would I lie
Sparkles in the bottles got it lookin' like 4th of July
I'm sitting fly, Bet You when I leave they gone remember me
Cause when I stepped up in the club I bought like 10 with me
Just to blow it you niggas claiming you kno
We blowin' money fast cash watch me throw it
Chickens notice I'm stuntin' they figure we chicken flippin'
Rose gold Prezi, the bands so dancing and glisten
She ain't sitting all these diamonds
They shining the fuck up your vision
See me standing on the couches wilding Rose spilling Pay
Dripping outside talkin' Ferrari to Spider
Might go night through the night I name that bitch night rider
'Cause we talkin' I talk to him back
Push start button all on that
0 To 60 in 2 seconds flat

[Chorus: Young Pooh]
50 Bottles of Ciroc, tell the waiter to make it sparkle
50 Bottles of Rose, tell 'em bring the sparkles
50 karat diamond chains just to see it sparkle
When we love the actin', love that it look like a car show
Benzez Ferrari's Bentley to Lamborghini
Brand new Maserati photo action you never seen it
Riding European all my whips foreign
When we in the club bottles on deck keep it pouring

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
50 bottles of Ciroc lets
Get the party started
I pull up in a space ship they thinkin I'm a martian
I'm bangin black and yellow so tell to be cautious
In this all black phantom shitting on 'em where my toilet
Maybach nigga with Bugatti dreams
All these choppas in the trunk just make the Rati lean
Can't really speak about it we did a lot of things
'Cause we be breakin' bricks bitch its the karate team
All black Louie belt sneakers diamond ye
Up in Nemon's at the register, like bombs away
Cause I be dropping shit you just be popping shit
Dont even write it but I'm nicer then the compliment
5 bad bitches red skins like Donavon
Take em to the telly with Omelly an demolish 'em
Bitch I'm honor
Roll good and my money promising
Step up in the game and cross the best like Allen Iverson
Just to see it sparkle
When we love the actin, Love that it look like a car show
Benzez Ferrari's Bentley to Lamborghini
Brand new Maserati photo action you never seen it
Ridin European all my whips foreign
When we in the club bottles on deck keep it pourin'

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
I wonder how it feel to be hatin' on a nigga like me?
'Cause every day I shine hard, my motherfuckin' wrist and neck be icy
Yeah, bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Bitch I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin'
Lot of hoes gimme they number you know I don't ever call 'em
Fuck them hoes, we getting paper
We getting dough, And you a hater let go

[Verse 3: Young Pooh]
Catch me dipping European coupe and you know that it's roofless
Bentley's spurring that kitty purrin' I'm poopa scooping
See me shitting coming through yeah I'm dipping
Got my diamonds all on display an this Audemars yeah it's glisten
Deep dishes I'm sittin' bitches picture me rollin'
An If you talkin' that work, Well tell them niggas we holdin'
Money comin' and goin' all [?] yeah it's moldin'

[Chorus: Young Pooh]
50 Bottles of Ciroc, tell the waiter to make it sparkle
50 Bottles of Rose, tell 'em bring the sparkles
50 karat diamond chains just to see it sparkle
When we love the actin', love that it look like a car show
