[Hook: JI]
If you sell a million records or your block doing numbers
Even if you put your [?] hustle non-stop
We be getting to that dollar get get getting to that dollar
We be getting to that dollar get get getting to that dollar
If you gamble or [?]
And if you got to feed your kids nigga get it how you live
We be getting to that dollar get get getting to that dollar
We be getting to that dollar get get getting to that dollar
You dig?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You dig, I be getting to that mula
Zapping through the traffic like [?], too fly
Me and my bad bitch she glance and look two times
Cause the outside Parmesan and the inside [?]
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my wrist check
I could get your bitch wet and I ain't even hit yet
When I see my p.o. I piss Ros√© for the piss test
She like you don't smoke weed it look like you blow cheese
We making paper like we grow trees
Hoe please, 40 on my like the OGs
Ya I be getting to that dollar
If it ain't about the money I don't even want to holler

[Hook: JI](x2)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
It don't matter if its nine to five
Or if I'm selling nine for nines
Nigga I gon' grind for mine
And kill them like atomic bombs
Trapping or its rapping its gon' equal me a dollar sign
Cause any situation I could compromise, hustler
This money I could never get enough of
So I go on route like a bus does Buster
Ya I be getting to that dollar
If it ain't about the money I don't even want to holler

[Hook: JI]
