Now & days loyalty is just a statement
Alot of niggas claim it , alot of niggas fakin
Same block , Same hood , same niggas bangin
Still twistin fingers , still we never changin
This That real music Tape, RNSx2 , bitch i love my squad to the death x2
Too loyal never change up , that fake shit get chu banged up
Hear dem niggas after me tell em get they aim up
Tryna chase a dollar still winnin , still brimmin
Its a hatworld still brimmin lil nigga
This rap shit i love my niggas gotta eat it too , these rap niggas they see thru , i swear they see thru
Free dem man the pigs got em locked in , alot of niggas gone but the block still poppin
Hold my niggas down 3's up to the death , my heart been cold chest epmty nothing left
Man i love my set , swear dem niggas truth , got some killers in the cut & i swear they love too shoot x2
