[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
30 racks of Diesel, watching for them people
2 birds in the kitchen; 1 brick, 1 desert Eagle
If the cops rush in, better flush it
Better pray to God they don't see you
Cause them F-E-D-S Boys want to L-I-F-and E you
So don't panic, don't panic, if they grab you
Don't panic, nigga dropping statements on the
Whole hood, they grabbed the nigga and he ramming
Got them young boys like 30 years still walking around
And he standing, bet that would've been one of my niggas
Bet you homie would've died quicker
My lawyer cost 100 thou', nigga, rats telling with no remorse
Shoot at us, no reports, we shoot at them they going to court
Fuck niggas want to go to war, just make sure you could stand it
And when them boys start rushing, nigga, just don't panic

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Pussy niggas panic, I could see they panties
Rain, snow, or sleet, I'm in these streets
And it's so organic, WB but no Atlantic
Play with me and I bet I'll handle it, 30 G's, 20 shows a month
That's too much to count and too much to manage
I'm on my dope boy shit, yeah my car's white
Motherfuck a hater, I done lived a hard life
I'm swanging out my building, trying to raise my children
Top got no ceiling, Yo Gotti
Nigga Meek Milly, counted my first million
That's when my whole life changed, I pledge allegiance to the streets
That I'll never panic if them FEDS came
That's on everything, money, bag and the bread game
My partner and them is my partner and them
Murder one or get guap with them, I'm Yo Gotti

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord
