[Vesre 1: Meek Mill]

Sipping on ciroc on’er then a light switch
Riding thru tha hood wit ma lil bad white chick
Ralph lauren 7 jeans, 9 to 5 night shit
In my 96 impala growlin thru the night shift
I check you like a mic quick, comin out ya damn mouth
Catch you while tha cameras off, show up to ya damn house
Like excuse me MA’AM where such & such ride hard no buckle up
All left hooks right uppercuts treat you like the beat then fuck you up
Im dippin on em wayback, we ain flippin we way strapped
Ma shooters they dont play around they lay you down like wave cap
In tha kitchen wit a 6 duce tryna turn there to a maybach
I whip whip, whip real hard like dale earnhard on the race track
Im in the front but im way back, way back but im in the front
Out shy niggas like ten to one, ???? but there ten of them
Bitch done fucked like ten of dem, oops I mean like ten of us
I don’t wanna ride it ain't tinted up,???? comin thru wit tha fender up
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and body
They ask me would I trade it all for a maseratti
I told him naw he said 100 mil n I said prolli
Plus a phantom, panamera and the bugatti
We can work a deal, I put my mom up on the hill
I go to hell and burn it down
They hatin every time I turn around
Being cocky, I turned it down, now it’s time, jus turn it up
I flame on then burn em up, them niggas act like they learnin up
IM GONE
