[Intro: Lihtz Kamraz]
Raf Simons on my shoes
I would never lose, I would never lose
(Infamous, infamous, infamous)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, huh

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)
I'm real that's in real life (Oh my)
Flood the rollie, tryna kill time (Kill)
Close your eyes and I will still shine (Shine)
My bitch tryna play me, she crazy (She crazy)
I'm fucking models on the daily (Ooh)
Anyway a nigga choose, I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose (Nah)
I will never lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will never lose (Yeah)
I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been through hell and back
Started off broke, lost it all, and I bring it back
Talking before the rap, on the corner, was selling crack
Where was the fuck you at? (Where?)
Make sure you tell 'em that (Tell 'em)
Left on your B-day, I said that I ain't coming back
'Cause you stay where them suckers at
I'm too real for that fake shit, you know I can't fuck with that
I could never lose, went and bought some better jewels
Mansion on the hills, with the better views
They was never real, bet they bet I lose
Tell 'em how you feel
Niggas sleeping on me, tell 'em let 'em snooze
When we see them niggas, treat them like they fools
Ayo with the Draco with the half a moon
Everytime I look up, I be in the news
Talking 'bout some shit I probably didn't do
All this controversy I done been through
It can never hurt me if it never murk me
Rest in piece to Snupe, Scooter, and Truz
Know the typa shit that I'm really into
I done put out lil Chino in a Benz too
I'm the motivation for them trenches too
Tell 'em bring up somethin' that I didn't do

[Bridge: Meek Mill]
Wins and them losses, turned us to bosses (Turned us to bosses)
Yeah, when them niggas started hating, man that's when they lost us
Yeah, I  seen their bitches switchin' sides soon as they cross us
Fuck 'em
But I never trip and I feel like that bull, I'm a Taurus (Love 'em)

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)
I'm real that's in real life (Oh my)
Flood the rollie, tryna kill time (Kill)
Close your eyes and I will still shining (Shine)
My bitch tryna play me, she crazy (She crazy)
I'm fucking models on the daily (Ooh)
Anyway a nigga choose, I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose (Nah)
I will never lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will never lose (Yeah)
I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, they put my back to the wall
I done seen all this shit happen before
I can't forget that I came from the bottom
But if I look back, I might happen to fall
Started out trapping, was packing that rock
We was trapping that raw
Thirty six O make it back like a boss
I seen they left, they all thought that I lost
Soon as I win, they all clapped and applaud
I seen my dawgs turned their backs, it was slow
I seen that bitch turn her back like a fraud
You turn your back, you can't come back no more
Shown the real monster, just cuttin' them off
Just when they thought, they was laughing at me
I was just sittin' back laughin' at y'all
From battlin' with Reed to rapping with Ross
To bagging famous bitches at the awards
Rags to riches on the tag of the car
Swap the wraith and go and grab me the Dawn
Flood the Patek, let it wrap around my arm
Load the ladder like we ready for war
And all of the energy, they gon' remember me after I'm gone
Still while I'm here nigga, I'm puttin' on
Roll with no fear, I just roll with the storm

[Chorus: Lihtz Kamraz]
I give a fuck what you feel like (You feel)
I'm real that's in real life (Oh my)
Flood the rollie, tryna kill time (Kill)
Close your eyes and I will still shining (Shine)
My bitch tryna play me, she crazy (She crazy)
I'm fucking models on the daily (Ooh)
Anyway a nigga choose, I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose (Nah)
I will never lose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I will never lose (Yeah)
I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
I will never lose
I will never lose, I will never lose
