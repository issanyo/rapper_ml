[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
Got booked with three bricks, you back home, niggas workin'
Clown-ass niggas, shoulda put you in the circus
Home of Philly, if you get a Benz niggas lurkin'
Churches, hearses, is it really worth it?
If you heard he tellin', why you dappin' and conversin'?
Lock me in the cell, let me strap on my Converses
Before I drop a dime, tell them people a lie
Swear to God, man, I was nineteen I caught my first case
Nine co-defendants and snitchin' wasn’t the worst case
Had a hard time givin' my name and my birth date
But nowadays niggas go to jail and it’s a earthquake
They get all shook up, write a whole book up
Rattin' their connect out, tellin' where they got the hook up
Got a niggas twenty years talkin' 'bout that cook up
Back to the home, niggas fuckin' with him, good luck
Twelve shots of Henny to the face got me stood up
Any situation, ask about me and I stood up
Catch you slippin' like a transmission, fuck your hood up
From my hood to who your hood, good, what up?
Ugh, nothin' though my hunnit high
This MAC will leave a nigga look like Spongebob

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said all I know is Flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell, no jet
Waves on them 360's make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that’s not me
She call me papi and I say "¡ven aqui!"
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche Box like Ali
My sneaks they Bally, in my hood I'm prob'ly
Just rollin' round in that Ghost, watchin' out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you merked
I put that on your head, nigga
First week and you dead, nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Catch me on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice and I got a lot
Like F your corner, nigga, I’ll buy the block
It’s Maybach, we way back
Yeah, I was starvin', this the payback
It's off the top…

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I got my hustle from Hova and my stuntin' from Baby
That’s why I'm fuckin' 'em over and my new watch cost me eighty
Got a couple of Rovers, had a drop one Mercedes
I know these suckers don’t like me, I'm probably poppin' they lady
I got 100 racks on me now
No computer but I got a MAC on me now
And I'm a shooter and I really clap homie now
And fuck the jail 'cause my nigga Ross hold me down
I'm skippin' bail and we in this bitch, fresh out the dealership
I just came in the game, but I'm killin' shit
My nigga Wale—
We in the building, we in the building

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
I had a dream like Martin Luther
I was in the Phantom gettin' brain like a Harvard student
Check my record for the fame, ain't really hard to prove it
Went to jail, came home to that kitchen just like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex tryin' to make a nine stretch
Just was in the yard with lifers, workin' on my biceps
You would think they all was like us, they ain't have my mindset
When I was missin' sleep and workin' weeks to get my mom set
And to get my son right so he don't live my young life
'Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
Middle of the jungle tryin' to make it to the sunlight
Stillmatic with that pen and pad, just give me One Mic
And I'm gon' get richer, they gon' get sicker
Why they mad at me? 'Cause they ain't in the picture
'Cause they was on some bullshit when they started flickin'
And the camera started flashin', niggas came up missin'

[Verse 5: Stalley]
Black Chevelle on them blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like I'm Blade, boy
Come through my city like, "What’s the focus, boy?"
I come though with open doors
Six by nines through theses door panels, make a bunch of noise
I’m mobbin' on these back streets and city blocks
Middle finger every cop
Chevy block engines, everything is heavy stop
Sweat pants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
Man, I'm losin' my religion
Got these angels on my shoulders and they tellin' me to listen
I blast this Alpine and get lost in my system
They tellin' me it's devil music and demons have imprisoned
My mind, body and soul and I’m travelin' down hell's road
This strap got no Velcro
So I’m down for whatever, whenever, wherever
Any way the hell I go
You think I’m scared and here’s your answer: hell no!

[Verse 6: Meek Mill]
Every night I’m on the road, tryin' to get how it come
Still findin' time just to kick it with my son
I know niggas see them blogs and it's lookin' like it's fun
But when you out to get that cake, you gotta pick every crumb
Yeah, you gotta pick every crumb
I never thought I'd see the day that I get up out the slums
Did it for my team, put 'em on some ones
And every day we shittin' on them, we them niggas with some runs
I was outta control, block was hot as a stove
I was out with them O's, same time the block was patrolled
