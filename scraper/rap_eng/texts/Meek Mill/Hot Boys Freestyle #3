[Intro]
We running this rap shit
Meek Milly, I’m running this rap shit
215 we running this rap shit
Philly, ah

[Verse 1]
I said I’m sitting here chilling in my old school whip
Me and old Melly and my old school clique
With a 45th of Volv, but some old school shit
Light skinned 32, that’s my old school chick
Why you hating, the money that I’m making?
I’m fly like [?] before he dropped a statement
I ain’t fronting, I ain’t faking
We ball like the Lakers
I’m up early in the morning, going hard for the paper
Going hard for the money, like what I wouldn’t do
The shit all on these rappers like a fucking number 2
I say I be coming through, Rolex be summer blue
Fresher than Will B, my homies be stunting too
And I brought the mac with me, and I ain’t talking Charlie
Harley, them shells smoke you, Bob Marley
Gnarly, I’m cooler than that white boy, surfing
If you throw your chick at me Imma catch em
