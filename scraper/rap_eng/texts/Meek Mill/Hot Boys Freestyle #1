[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rob me I get them gunned down
Choppa style goons lurking when the sun down
Haters throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald hommie when that clip spill
I've seen people go upstate with wills
Beat their appeal make it home then get killed
Cause shit real nigga up in Philadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like killer whale
Free Willy and Meek Milly
He really bout that ask a nigga vouch that
Pussy nigga softer than a pillow top mattress
Rappers actors like Samuel L. Jackson
You throwing money, you ain't even own a crib yet
You ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet
You ain't send no money to your man doing bid yet
But you making it rain you a fucking lame
Y'all lames man

I'm in the SRT with an ACP
My sneaks ACG put out an APB
I make my bars go together like the ABC
I'm the club throwing dubs sipping A-C-E, spado
Ain't talking Tony when we say that yayo
In the kitchen we Miracle Whipping like its mayo
We hit the block and hit the rock like Ay-o
On the grizzy my shooters with me call them O.J. Mayo, woah!
