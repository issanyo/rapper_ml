[Intro: Meek Mill]
Aye look, go and get ya motha fuckin' scale and bag after this

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm on that backblock, I'm trynna get it all
It's money out chea, I'm trynna get it all
My nigga got that neck, I tell 'em send it off
Twenty a the joint? Ok we playing ball

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Heater in my tire, crack up in my draws
Watching out for Shamrock?, he trynna get us all
They want cases up, they trynna send us off
Head me upstate, working all up out the yard
Taskforce Tuesday, watch out where the cars at
Tell my youngin watch out for the molly, booze, and [?]
Taskforce swinging through the jungle like they Tarzan
Slowing down, staring at me like they see the market
I pulled out the stack pack trynna bring a stack back
Break it down, headed up, run through it like a [?]
Flip it once, flip it twice, then put it where my stash at
Tipee say he got a lick and I say where the cash at
And I'mma bring my ladder out of storage, where my men at
He say he got twenty keys and we gonna go and grab that
Interception, that's a touchdown
We was fucked up, but we up now

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: AR-AB]
They say money make the world spin
I'm at the Louis store, spending like a whirlwind
Put ya AR crying about a girlfriend
I'd rather get the Pyrex and drop girl in
I get straight to the pussy, no foreplay
I was sitting in jail for a short stay
Let a nigga show up on court day
I'mma show 'em the moon in broad day
AK, street sweep, no dustpan
Cut grams, play the corner like the cut man
I left school and used to hang in the hooky house
I dropped powder in water and pulled a cookie out
Big money, gotta account for three days
White girl, I make her drop like D. Wade
Purp wind, Sour D or the P Haze
I had a girl telling me I got three legs

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Shizz Nitty]
The way we got them pies in, nothing with this grinding
Take it to the kitchen, find a flame and get to frying
Grab the sixty-two, got a point they grip the nine
Scratch my head, look at my man like yo we grinding
Used to play the crib, now we block it like a line
Raised from the street where them coppers wait in line
My boys ain't doing great, but they doing kinda fine
They [?] or they ain't, never stuck up in the line man
Heard about them niggas, how they sing like Frankie Lineman
Crying like my bitches, used to nickel now I dime shit
Niggas want me fail like the prison system jail
When we vision all whipping all till I'm in a cell
I got niggas pushing Ls, cause a nigga took an L
On the pill, hope he win, come home bringing hell
Get the orders from the kitchen then I sit it on the scale
Break it down, take the orders, then we send it like it's mail

[Hook] 2x
