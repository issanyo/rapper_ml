[Intro: Meek Mill]
Young niggas gettin' money
And we don't owe you niggas shit
I'm from Philly nigga
We come from the bottom
Come from nothin'
And niggas got the nerve to ask me why I'm stuntin'?
Huh?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'da sip Ciroc with Diddy, drunk Spade with Hov
In the VIP of the 40, with some bad-ass hoes
Had my grip on my forty, still was at that stove
The same night work got cooked half that sold
A pyrex and a triple beam
Like Mr. King had a dream we ain't miss a fiend
Talking dirty to these niggas with my Listerine
If I was there you know we ball, Mr. Clean
I'm talking LIV Sunday blowing hella racks
Just getting right cause in my life I been from hell and back
I'm just that nice and I don't write so you can tell 'em that
I'm just making up for nights when I was selling crack
On the corner in the cold tryna sling them O's
And half my niggas in the city went against the code
Them niggas told, still partying them niggas bold
But I'm like fuck it I'm young and getting it them niggas old
Take a walk up to that mirror boy look at yourself
You see a getta or a nigga just lookin' for help
And every night I'm in the studio killing myself
A lot of niggas hate me now cause I'm feeling myself
Fuck em' though
They screaming be humble, boy be humble
But ain't nobody say that when my stomach used to rumble
Looked in a cell when I seen my dreams crumble
Now I'm out here buzzing you can here the bee's bumble

[Pre-Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Seen some things that can't be told
I was told these roads was pure as gold
I never told I never sold my soul
I just went at every thing I dove

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Niggas getting high, just to take the pain away
When I'm just getting by couple million for a rainy day
Off season but I practice like I got a game today
And everybody ain't gon' make it out it's a shame to say
Feeling like Mike before the fade away
I'm like should I take the shot? or let it fade away?
And all this love I'm getting ain't gon' take the hate away
But these haters motivate me in a crazy way
Ain't no I in team - from what I done seen
It's every man for himself well, until I intervene
I put my niggas on paper, we swarm paper like lions when they smell blood
When dream shatters they sell love like cocaine
Or heroin from heroin I'm Cobain
I'm blowing up I did my own thing
They want my soul and my body for a little change
I'm dancing with the Illuminati, call it Soul Train
Nigga

[Pre-Chorus:  Guordan Banks]
Seen some things that can't be told
I was told these roads was pure as gold
I never told I never sold my soul
I just went at everything I dove

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Last night I forgot to pray for shit that I got today
The devil 'round the corner and the reaper a block away
It's body after body very few of us find a way
You gotta watch for the hook like you sticking Dr. J
My defensive is like three fences and a brick wall
I get soft every time we go against ya'll
I'm on guard play the point like I'm Chris Paul
You get crossed like AI did Mike for this ball
For this rock, you get shot, picked off
Cause in this game we shooting metal like it's pin ball
I put this Mac to your face like lip gloss
And do you right and put you on ice like Lindros
Nigga

[Chorus: Guordan Banks]
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I started with a dollar and a dream
And I'm willing to go and get it by any means
I can't be every nigga role model
Why nobody my role model
I got my own son to raise
And my life is very precious
And my son expect me to walk through that door every night
So any nigga try and stop my shine gotta get it
All my niggas out to get it
And we ain't never going back to the bottom
None of my niggas
I hear everybody talking
He spending too much money be humble
Man fuck all that
Who was talking when I was dead broke starving huh?
Ay Gutta, what these niggas talking huh?
It's D.C. double M, G
We been jumped out the barrel on your crab ass niggas
You heard me?
Meek Milly, real nigga for life!
