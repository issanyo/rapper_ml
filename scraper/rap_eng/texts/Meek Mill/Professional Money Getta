[Hook x2]
I gotta lotta dough
Cause getting money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

They ask me what I do
I keep they mouths froze
Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima proffessional money getta
Ima professional money getta

[Verse 1]
I said I wake up in the morning wash my face and brush my teeth
Finna chase the money I put on my running sneaks
Cause nothing in this world ain't gon come for free
So ima go and get it if it ain't gon come to me
Yeah! who runnin with us
Who fuckin with us
The teacher asked me what I wanna be, a money getta
When I was broke I did a joke, I was a funny nigga
Now I don't really play around, I'm gettin money nigga
Started on the stoop, turn a quarter to a coup
Say the profit and regroup
Shitted on them haters, OOOPS!
Buy my bitties ever bags so they can ball like jill swoops
All I do is get the money and spend it like the world do
This old head told me money it don't mean nothin
I was thinkin in my head like he ain't seen nothin
Cops at me by the car I ain't seen nothin
If u won't fall for anything you ain't mean nothin

[Hook]
I gotta lotta dough
Cause getting money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta
Ima professional money getta

They ask me what I do
I keep they mouths froze
Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima proffessional money getta
Ima professional money getta

[Verse 2]
I say I'm tryna turn a dolla to a million
I was knockin at the door they wouldn't let me in the buildin
So I took it to the streets sold my mixtapes and I killed em
Same ho dat fronted on that nigga now they feel em, steel him
Broke bitches on my back, now u want my autograph
Told em in miami, I'm gonna fan em all up on that ass
They was chasin random chicks and I was chasin around that cash
Dawg I ain't find my swag until the day I found my stage
Money make the world go round and all them pretty girls go down
Blizzy on deck cause in the day it can still go down
That money don't make u real u a dildo clown, u fake!
If they ain't gettin money now a days they hate
It ain't my birthday but I'm eatin my cake
But I ain't gotta eat cause I already ate
Yeah I'm already straight!

[Hook]
I gotta lotta dough
Cause getting money all a nigga know

Cause gettin money all a nigga know
Ima professional money getta

You know ima money getta
A money gettin professional
A money gettin professional

You know ima money getta
A money gettin professional
A money gettin professional
