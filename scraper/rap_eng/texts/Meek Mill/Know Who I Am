[Intro: Meek Mill]
We done made it through all them motherfucking shootouts and dodged all them cases
Started with nothing now we got all this money
We blessed
God blessed us dreamchasers
I used to pray to God to get a million bucks
I used to pray to hit that bitch until I fucked
I used to pray these haters never hit me up
[?] nigga we blessed

[Hook: K Smith]

I'm a west side nigga on the west side

Niggas hating but he know he got no clout
Got killers so I bring Cole out

At the blue store just like Roc
Looking for me I be right on my block
I ain't worried 'bout none of these niggas
It's just me and my niggas
My whole cold, wrist is
Try to snatch my chain that's your exit
I ain't worried about a thing got the things for my hitters
Got the things for my hitters in the trenches with the lions and gorillas
I thank God for my hitter
