[Verse 1: Lil' Snupe]
Chasing after green gods
Went from sleeping on the porch to a motherfucking California king sized
Momma ain't stressin' she know that its all good
My number one goal is to get her out the hood
Never changed, I be thuggin' hard in my section
Me and all my dawgs protected by Smith & Wessons
Any nigga playin' we comin' in your direction
Let you know that we ain't flexing, you quickly gon' get ejected
Niggas want to kill me cause a nigga coming up
Want to kill 'em but that shit might really fuck my money up
Focus on my grind gotta get the stacks
Tryna leave the streets alone but they steady calling back
You ever seen death around the corner
Chilling on the block and pussy niggas run up on ya
Busting shells at you and they hotter than a sauna
It be hard to think straight when its a lot of niggas want ya
Man

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ok I've been the king for this rap shit
Stuntin' hard and never had shit
Remember me with them nappy braids?
When I was down on my last shit?
Bet them niggas wasn't mad then
Took advantage I asked them
For a shot at this, start laughing
It took a year or two and I passed them
Y'all niggas all look like haters
You ain't even put your dawg on paper
Word around that you tricking on bitches
Catch you with your chain on I'mma take it
Now everybody catching these vapors
Now everybody want and need favors
Southside, NY in Jamaica
Nicki on the bike throw it up, scrape it
With 100 niggas 'hind me
North side down in Philly where you find me
Riding 'round with a 30 on my lap in a big ass phantom
I whip the Bentley like a johnny
Watching out for the 2-11 robbery
Bang motherfucker for the money and the respect
Hit 'em in the head with the stick nigga eject (shit!)
Mo money, mo money, mo money, mo problems (shit!)
Why you think I really went and bought more choppers (shit!)
Mo money, mo money only bringing more robbers (shit!)
Want to see me in a box I went Porsche Boxster
Show me some evidence
Never was better than nor was you relevant
I'm too competitive
Walk in the club, get my .357 in
My level on excellent
I cut the brick like its cards and I shuffle it
You told 'em we selling it
A mouse in the building, I act like an elephant
Who the fuck just let the devil in
Come to my city they treat me like president
Ain't got no pity for niggas that's settling
I had that La La and Melo, was selling them nicks for J.R. Smith
Niggas try to kill me but they all miss
My down fall what they all wish
Had a lot of homies but they all switched
Word up my nigga

[Break: Meek Mill]
(Laughter)

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing

[Post-Hook: French Montana]
I got all these chains and this change on me (we lit!)
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me (fuck 'em!)
Man it ain't a thang got the thang on me
Man I see a clearport plane on me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
You see me coming 'round your corner lookin' like I got a check
Flew into your city me my niggas on the jet
Ballin' every time I take a shot I hit the net
And everyday niggas want the money for respect
I ain't trippin' I got money, clothes, car, hoes
Shoppin' 'til the mall close
Lord knows, I could fit a brick up in these cargos
I don't fuck with niggas cause they all told
Worry 'bout another nigga money like they all hoes
I'm just with my niggas spinning hella blocks
Bad bitch on all my Banshee I'm like twelve o' clock
Vroom vroom I might do a hundred block
In the back hundred niggas deep and we like fuck the cops

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing

[Post-Hook: French Montana]
Got all these chains and this change on me
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me
Man it ain't a thang got the thang on me
Man a see a clear port plane on me, slide

[Outro: Papi]
What's your grandma name
What's your gr-gr-grandma name, grandma name
What's your grandma name
What's my grandma name

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'
I caught cases never told 'em nothing
