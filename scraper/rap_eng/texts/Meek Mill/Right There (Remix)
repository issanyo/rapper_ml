[Intro: August Alsina]
Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there
Right there, right there, right there

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
I know how it be when you trying your best
But you turn around, and you got nothing to show for it
So you stay on your grind, tryna get to the shine
Even turn to crime, but how come I ain't made it yet?

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
I'm just like you (I know the feeling y'all), I been there too
I hope you feel me cause I, been through the pain
There ain't a difference, you and I are the same

[Hook: August Alsina]
Homie I was
Right there, right there, right there, right there
I was right there where you are I can't forget that I was
Right there, right there, right there, right there
Now I'm reaching for the stars but I remember I was
Right there, right there, right there
Homie I was
Right there, right there, right there
Getting money
Right there, right there, right there
Born and raised
Right there, right there, right there
I remember

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I remember nights there, when I had to go to sleep
In the back of the Quick & Easy
Chilling on the boulevard
With them hardheaded niggas from the 7th ward
Had a chick in the Ville, who was down for a nigga that's real
Use to have fam in the Florida projects
That's why I'll never forget

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I remember them nights
I couldn't remember them nights
High off the weed and the liquor
Just tryna get to the light
I know some guys on my hood
They've never been on a flight
I tell em to open their minds
You could be fly as a kite
My people they dying to fight
Fighting to die and they wonder what life
And it sounds like an animal crying at night
I've been here before but I'm tryna live right
Cause them streets will take your friends, your family, your freedom
So make your exit plan and get up out em
Cause you don't need em
Homie I was right there

[Hook]
