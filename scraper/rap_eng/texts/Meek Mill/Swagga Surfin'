The Man up top got me, let's get it
Philly in this bitch
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Okay! Maybe it's my swagger
Every time I come around these haters getting madder
Gangstas in the kitchen wit it, whippin' up the batter
When them hoes see me they like Meek Mill you getting fatter
I'm eating bitch I'm eating bitch
Liver than your weekend get
Della Reese I'm beasting shit
Now shut up ho and eat this dick
Call your friends and we can get
A MÃ©nage just like Nicki is
Baby by me be a millionaire like 50 is
Ten thousand all on my wrist
Louis V's all on my feet
Louis V all on my belt
Checkerboard all on my teeth
Check that boy I'm MOB I'm all about a Benjamin
Shawty say her pussy wet guess I'm gon' go swim in it
Splash! I laugh
Get money got cash
You hating you mad
I made it too bad
Chicks say I'm too fast
I tell them I'm a freak
And if you ask about around Philly they gon tell you I'm the streets
I'm the mayor around where I be
They say who that, we that
Cause I drop that China white and make her say I be back
Shawty off that crack pipe bet I make her relapse
Put it in her mouth and make her suck that shit believe that
Rest in peace to shotty
This 40 on my body
In the middle of the jungle this shit realer than Jumanji
And I'm strapped shoot first
[?] get murked
[?] this verse
They gon ask where the work

[Verse 2: K. Smith]
These niggas hating on me cause I buy the shit they wanted
And their bitches want to fuck me cause they say I look like money
I be swagging on them hop in my bag on them
I switch that Lexus to a Beamer now I'm backing on them
They call me big bank shawty Mr. GetHerGoing
Ricky Bobby on your ho and stanky leg up in her tummy
I be flyer than a [?] and I be leer jet stunting
If it ain't about money then it ain't about nothing
Meek Milly in this bag so I'm pulling out the louie
Just to fill it up with cash and my Gucci's full of truies
And my life is like a movie got these bitches all chewy
Pool party at my crib and I got your girl in my Jacuzzi
See I got so many cars that I don't even got to drive
Helicopter in the back all I got to do is fly
Call me Maybach shawty when I hit than one-on-one
Doing 100 in the lanes like a nigga on the run
