It definitely wasn’t insulting. It was like me playing Dion one-on-one in basketball. I’d tell you ‘Dion, I’m going to slam on you. I’m going to cross you over, I’m going to give you 30 points today.' Kendrick Lamar, I don’t think he was trying to insult any of us, you know. We all know each other personally.

It’s like a sport. I look at it like, that’s motivation, as far as like, he said your name, that means you’re dong something. If he didn’t say your name… You’ve got to look at it like me going against Kobe. I’m trying to kill him.

There were a lot of names that weren’t mentioned. I like those type of games. I definitely don’t think it was an insult. It was a competition thing. A competitive type thing. I live for competition. Everyone who knows me knows I don’t want to lose in a game of nothing. I don’t want to lose in a game of tic-tac-toe. I’m not going to make a diss record for Kendrick Lamar. But if he wants to get competitive, we’re going to have some fun.
