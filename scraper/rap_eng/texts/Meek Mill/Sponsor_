[Intro: Nick Papz]
Pa-Papamitrou- BOI!

[Verse]
Niggas said they would be with me but I don't be with niggas
Diamonds shining like a swiper all my pieces hitin' lit
The niggas broke and can't be beefing with us
Put some respect up on my name, all tree them niggas
I got a fetish for fettucine and a Lamborghini
Bad bitches that never see me want to double team me
Triple double get what I want like I own a genie
Aladdin, my bitch look like Jasmine
Fuckin' with that nigga and you know he told
I'm the realest nigga on the totem pole
Chasin' down the money 'til I overload
Two bad bitches on the menu I take both of those
I don't care if they was real sisters
Niggas broke talkin' like they real niggas
Only thing that's real about 'em is that they real bitter
And real salty fuck 'em
