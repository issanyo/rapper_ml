Oh lord, what you yellin', nigga?
Penthouse nights, fresh out the cellar, nigga
All that white, like what you sellin', nigga?
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors, nigga
I've been on money since 19, 20
Or maybe 21, I had 'bout 300
And I ain't talkin' 'bout Chief Keef or Lil Reese
But all my niggas keep heat, a lil' piece
