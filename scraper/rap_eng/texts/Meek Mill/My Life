[Intro]
My life
My life
Isn't my life

[Verse 1]
What you know bout the grind in the street
He move and work out of town every week
I know about it
I know about it
What y'all know bout them girls on the pole
She make her money every night
Taking off her clothes
I know about it
Yep I know about it

[Pre-hook]
Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from niggas die everyday
Bet you ain't seen a nigga die right in ya face

[Hook]
The life The life
The sacrifice
The grind The grind
You get sometimes
I know about it
Don't judge if you know nothing bout it
You try and try to
Live right
But we get blinded by the life
I know about it
Don't judge
If you know nothing bout it

[Verse 2}
These niggas turning hoes into wife's
Went in raw now you stuck with her for life
I know about it
Bet y'all know something about it
Three years he been doing the same thing
You can hang it up you'll never get a ring
Cause I know about it
Bet I know some thing about it

[Pre-hook]
Cause all my life I've been struggling and stressing
That's why I come up in this bitch with aggression
Where I'm from it ain't flowers and candy
I'm just happy the life didn't get me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I said the life the life
The streets are a bitch and I made her my wife
I made her my wife
I couldn't afford but I made her my price
Cause under the lights the money the cars
Even the ice I wanted it all
Some nights we were up selling the raw
And ducking them D from a hell of charges
I wanted to shine amongst with the stars
I wanted to grind they telling me nah
I felt like these niggas was telling me starve
My mama she told me I'm headed for bars
Bars, and where did it take me
To a cell and a yard
Running bar with the killers
Talking fellas and all

[Hook]
