[Hook: Trav]
Touch one of mine I take 10 of yours
My money long we go to war
You don't really want them killers on you
You don't really want them killers on you

[Verse 1: Trav]
So many nightmares that they trying to kill me
Hundred round drum better not come near me
Kill we kill, niggas got to feel me
You take one of mine I'mma kill your family
Got a hundred rounds I'mma let it blow
Shooters fill 'em up that's a holy ghost
Niggas say they want it they don't want no smoke
I'm front line I'mma let it blow
If I said he got to go then that nigga got to go
Creep 'em like Jason
Face mask glove on put pain in
[?]
All my niggas got bodies no statements
Body on his way home got eight in
All my niggas make it hot like cajun
Fish eye put your brains on the pavement
Do you niggas even know who you playing with
Muhfucker

[Hook: Trav]
Touch one of mine I take 10 of yours
My money long we go to war
You don't really want them killers on you
You don't really want them killers on you
Touch one of mine I take 10 of yours
My money long we go to war
You don't really want them killers on you
You don't really want them killers on you

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They murdered the homies
They hit up my nigga we rocking and rolling
I see 'em we murder his homies
I come with them hittas, I'm praying to God my haters get murdered before me
Remember that picture so vivid, that corner remember that burner was on me
Them coppers was rolling up on me, patrolling up on me
We strapped
We give no fuck 'bout the law, if its 'bout busting that jaw
We double back
We pulling up at your car, hitting and cutting you off
Then it's a rap, put your face up on the wall
On a t-shirt for your dawg
Homie's a rat, talk to them people and all

[Verse 3: Trav]
Meek, I'm shooting 'em all
You ever seen a drum on a broom stick
[?], not a pool stick
Southside nigga still on my bullshit
FN nighttime that cautious
Catch him lacking I off him
Broad day nighttime I torch him
Murder, mayhem, extortion
All my niggas put work in, muhfucker

[Hook: Trav]
Touch one of mine I take 10 of yours
My money long we go to war
You don't really want them killers on you
You don't really want them killers on you
Touch one of mine I take 10 of yours
My money long we go to war
You don't really want them killers on you
You don't really want them killers on you
