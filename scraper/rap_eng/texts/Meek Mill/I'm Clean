[Hook: Young Dro]
I'm clean in this bitch
I'm clean in this bitch
I'm clean in this bitch
Grand Hustle team with kings we getting rich (x2)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm Prada-ed down Polo-ed up
Hit the A, tell Charlie hold up
Call my nigga Dro, pull a rose up
[?] body shit looking like a tour bus
I'm clean in this bitch leaning like they selling Promethazine in this bitch
I'm Grand Hustle team with kings we getting rich
Wilding on the couch screaming out "free my nigga TIP"
Meek Milly what's the deally I be popping like a wheelie
I put on for my city I go hard for North Philly that be me
Diamonds so clear you can see them in HD
I'm down to disappear pop up all on MTV
Niggas looking at the screen like its ghosts that they see
I like my Ros√© red my diamonds blue my money green
TIP put me on the team cause I'm so fresh and so clean

[Hook: Young Dro]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
I'm clean in this bitch
Young Dro Grand hustle flow
My [?] play stingray everything [?]
Dro and Meek Mill get respect to the utter most
Cocaina deals white bricks just like Russell Crowe
New York City leather coat out in Buffalo
And when I lie to hoes my dick be growing like Pinocchio
I ain't really sociable my 44 ain't approachable
[?] shawty I stay right close to the [?]
Stupid ass pistol I like to make that thing transform
Fucking get your whole block blew up by this hand bomb
When I heard this track I started tripping like a motherfucker
Went up in the booth and went sicker than a motherfucker
Triple thugger, oh you know I'm all about that shine ho
All kinds of ice bitch my diamonds got diamonds on
Stupid ass fresh shawty you don't want to pardon me
Hold up, I need to answer my phone some ho calling me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm clean in this bitch players only live uno
Ralph Lauren all the way to the ground you know
Prada on my feet my chick a five times two though
My flow be hot as hell but my wrist keep me cool though
Cujo, ya cause I be snapping and I ain't trapping
I'm just rapping and look what happened
It ain't march I'm causing madness
We Maybaching on them two-tone
Crushing them like crouton
The cheers in the rear leaning back on the futon
Grand Hustle we do one thing
Get money money money money money I'm a young king
I don't talk I let my gun sing
Nigga got a problem with it tell them my revolver said it
