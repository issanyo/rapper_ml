[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm too drunk, I'm too high to hear that fuck shit
Came to the club, yeah, I'm on that fuck shit
Let them things blam, let them things blam
Let them things blam, let them things blam
I'm too fucked up, too turnt up I'm on fuck shit
Let them things blam, let them things blam
My chopper filled up, let them things blam
My handguns got extendos, let them things blam
I'm from Riverdale, full of young niggas
Ain't no OGs, just some young niggas
Gangbangin', Sellin' weed
Shootouts, and some ecstasy
Them boys gone, them boys crazy, most have lost their mind
Whole clique strapped up, fuck one time
Above the law, hey my nigga, I'm on my grind
Afraid of the dark, so I'm forced to shine
Let them guns blam, bitch, you know I am
I go Kanye, Jay-Z H.A.M., this the Summer of Sam

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Let them guns blam (Flocka)
Let them guns blam (Flocka)
Let them guns blam (Flocka)
Let them guns blam (Flocka)
Friends turned to enemies, enemies turned to friends
Eat you like some busy bees, kill you and your best friend
Let them guns blam (bow)
Let them guns blam (bow)
Let them guns blam (bow)
Let them guns blam (bow)
Too turnt up on my block
Middle finger to the law, fuck a cop
Real nigga till my heart stop
That K will make your body rock

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
Won't stop 'til I see a body drop
Fuck 'round, get mollywhopped
Leave my shawty off the top
I'm about a check
See my young niggas love to flex
Strapped up with that tech
Want beef, no talking, shawty that's a bet
Live with no regrets, where you from shawty throw up your set
Heard a nigga want me dead, got a check on my head but I got too much respect
Pride, dignity, while you're hating on me I'm making history
Waka goin' broke boy shittin' me
Throw money on a bitch, ain't shit to me
Let them guns blam, let them guns blam
This a 44 bulldog it cannot jam

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My friends turn to my enemies, my enemies turn friends
Ain't talkin' about no pills nigga, we slide around with extends
I'm ridin' 'round in this Benz
50 rounds in this mac
I put a price on your head and they gone gun you down for them racks
Y'all niggas ain't totin' no straps
Y'all niggas don't want no war
Y'all niggas don't want my goons
Hangin' 'round by your front door
But that hot shit, cause you pop shit
Runnin' 'round like you got shit
Had my niggas all in your crib
Cause you runnin' 'round like you got bricks
Most niggas die cause they switch sides
And do dumb shit when they get high
Cross me, it won't get by
Try to play it cool, and you'll get fried
All the real niggas on this side
Niggas shoot like Dirk do
Every nigga that's 'round me get real money and murk too

[Hook]
