[Intro]
This shit right here for my Oodles o' Noodles babies
His ma’ smoked the crack while she was pregnant so he can't even help that he crazy
He goin' to jail, it’s inevitable, forreal

[Verse 1]
I ain't have nobody to give me no hope
I hope my momma ain't doin' no coke
I used to wish that my daddy was livin'
I had a dream that I seen him as ghost
I used to act up when I went to school
Thought it was cool, but I really was hurt
Wanted my family to come to my games
My mama couldn't make it 'cause she was at work
Lived with my grandma, she took me to church
Really no I ain't wanna go
Remember I kissed my aunt in the casket
And her forehead was cold
I was like 4 years old
We couldn’t afford no clothes
It was hand me down
Who would think a nigga get a Grammy now?
Got a black judge tryna tear me down
All this jail time probably wear me down
Turn the lights off in the bathroom
Screaming, "Bloody, Bloody, Bloody Mary" now
Havin’ nightmares about Candyman
With the tool on me like a handyman
Killed my lil' cousin, I’m like, "Damn it, man"
Had to see the footage on a camera, man
On the pavement, with his brains out
With the white sheet, he was laid out
Wanna ask 'Ye, "Is this a choice?"
It was like this when I came out
What the fuck is you really complaining 'bout?
I know niggas that's never gon’ make it out
This that shit you won't see in the media
Poor get poorer and the rich gettin' greedier
Lot of daddies goin' back and forth out of jail
Lot of sons growin' up and repeating them
This the belly of the beast, you won't make it out
Man, this shit was designed just to eat us up
And my momma told, "Nigga, keep it up
You gon' end up in prison, just sweepin' up"
Remember, nobody never believed in us
When they see us now, they can't believe it's us, no

[Interlude]
I think it's funny how
We used to go to school, play SEGA's
And then, next thing you know, you runnin' 'round with Glock .40s
We ain't never believed in the police, they was shootin' us

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they called it the projects, they put us in projects
What they gon' do with us? Can't call the cops yet
You might just get popped at
'Cause they the ones shootin' us
I'm on my mom's steps, it's like a bomb threat
The violence pursuing us, I ain't meet God yet
'Cause I'm on the block where
It's just me and Lucifer, look what they do to us
They know we in poverty
When I went to court, the judge said, "Meek, you a menace to society"
Huh, you said, you would give me a chance, your honor, why would you lie to me?
16 more years of probation, you know you gon' get some more time on me, huh
Whole hood goin' crazy, babies havin' babies
She was fourteen, actin' like she eighty
Got pregnant by a nigga that was locked up in them cages
And the story goes on, if you make it, you amazing (Word up)

[Outro]
See, I got homie that's a billionaire
And I be tryin' to explain it to him like
If your mom ain't on crack or if she got a job and she doing eight hours a day
And your daddy in the graveyard or in the jail cell, who the fuck gon' babysit?
