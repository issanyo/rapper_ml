Verse 1
These niggas pussy can't respect these nigga (Pussy)
They finna make me drop a check on niggas (Fuck them niggas)
I heard these niggas actin' foul now (Foul now)
Till we slide up on them put that tech on niggas (Here we go)
Ever since I got some money they been acting funny (wooh)
I got married to that paper, holy matrimony (wooh)
My niggas shooting better back up off me
Times changed now my mom and em all got matching Rollies
Every nigga round' me on one (On one)
Every bitch around me on dope (On coke)
Countin' up this money with my Rollies (With my Rollie nigga)
And the forecast says it more snow
Every time we hear the load drop
We be making hoes drop
Lil' bit of baking soda
Bring it back a whole lot
And we got them pills if
Niggas like to Perc pop
I got niggas uptown
We're down to get served out
I be with my real niggas screaming gang gang
Ridin' dirty with the 30, let it hang hang
Time to pull up on you with yo main thang
I done seen the money make these bitches do some strange things

Chorus
I'ma get money (Get money)
Get to it (Get to it)
We winning (Winning)
They losing (Losing)
They hating (They hate)
I knew it (I knew it)
Flooded the Jesus (flooded the Jesus)
No Judas
Wooh, woooh, wooh

Hook
I been out Miami for a week (For a week)
I got double seats all in my 6 (on my 6)
Get your bitch some shoes like Cinderella (Cinderella)
She gon' treat this D like she a beast

Verse 2
Money, power, respect
Shit I live like what I rap
All these niggas that got murked
Shit we did bout' that check
Make me run up on you niggas
Snatch that shit up off your neck
Super-soak that AK
All you niggas gon' get wet
I hear everybody talking like they shooters (Like they shooters)
Popping shit from their computers
But if they act like bitches
When we see em that's how we do em
Everytime I see a hater I be thinking hallelujah
I'm still moving with the same niggas
On the same shit
Tell me why my side hoe
Better than your main bitch?
Tell me why my side hoe
Doesn't speak no English?
You ain't talking money nigga, you don't speak my language. Ho! (Who the fuq is Stevie J?)
These niggas pussy can't respect these niggas. (Pussy)
They finna make me drop a check on niggas. (Fuck them niggas)
I heard these niggas actin' foul now. (Foul now)
Till we slide up on them put that tech on niggas

Chorus
I'ma get money (Get money)
Get to it (Get to it)
We winning (Winning)
They losing (Losing)
They hating (They hate)
I knew it (I knew it)
Flooded the Jesus (Flooded the Jesus)
