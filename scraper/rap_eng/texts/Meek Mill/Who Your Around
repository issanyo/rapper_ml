[Intro: Meek Mill]
One night I prayed to God (I prayed to God)
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life (from my life)
And before you know it I started losing friends (losing friends)

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks (folks)
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts (toasts)
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope (yeah)
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first (first)
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first (family)
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt (hurt)
Cause you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn ghost (yeah)
I would have rolled for you even in the same hearst (whoah)
Same cemetery, bury me in the same dirt (dirt)
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work (work)
"B.H we straight," that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do? (weed do)
And when I came home I tried to feed you (feed you)
And every song I was screamin' free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too (bleed too)
Now when I ride by I breeze through (breeze through)
I don't even stop, ain't a need to (not to)
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you (you)
Shit got realer (realer), niggas got richer (richer)
I said the money train coming (coming), niggas missed it (I missed)
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you (get you)
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister (damn)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They want more than my mother (mother)
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother (brother)
Greedy motherfucker (fucker)
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em (love)
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard (ball hard)
Still sending earned money for his calling cards (calling cards)
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars (Ricks at)
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all (nah)
Cuz none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet (nah)
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet (yeah)
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet
Gone
