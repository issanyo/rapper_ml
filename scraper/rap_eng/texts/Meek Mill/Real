[Verse 1]
I said, I used to get high just to get by
Couldn't deal with my reality, was livin' in a lie
Sometimes I asked God, "Is we livin' just to die?"
Conversations with my dad, and he livin' in the sky
I think, "Am I goin' crazy? Or is this shit for real?"
The spirit of a nigga who will or is appealed
Fightin' to see the light and I'm fightin' to keep it real
Like a nigga with no lawyer, I'm ready to take a deal
Got me feelin' like Khaled 'cause all I do is win
I don't practice no religion 'cause all I do is sin
I don't even write it down, I'm just spittin' out what's in
I don't celebrate for victory, man, all I do is grin
Ugh, shit, I ain't braggin', I don't boast
But when it come to bread, fuck a slice, I need a loaf
And a little bit of toast just to keep the haters off me
Man, I do this for my city, all the niggas waitin' on me

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
Youngin' full of pride, tendencies of a G
I never gave a fuck what ya heard about me
Never told, never sold my soul, nigga this is me

[Verse 2]
I'm a family man
Don't you ever cross that line where my family stand
I send them boys to come and get you in that family van
Cold shooters that love them hammers like Yosemite Sam
I'm from a hood where these niggas scared to dream at
Fuck the money, they wanna know where the lean at
They make ya' lean back, I'm talkin' fade-away
Mike Jordan, gettin' it ain't important
How can I forfeit? Niggas makin' a fortune
Livin' in fortresses, gettin' it on some corporate shit
Go hard or go home and this the orphanage
Same niggas that I grew up I be often with
Small circle 'cause niggas a murk you
Most of the time it's niggas that know, but my niggas is purple...
Hearted, I seen the snakes before they even started
Caught 'em and the was dearly departed

[Chorus]
Look into my eyes, tell me what you see
Youngin' full of pride, tendencies of a G
I never gave a fuck what ya heard about me
Never told, never sold my soul, nigga this is me
