We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue

By killing cops and selling drugs,but what can you do?

Buying a killing product, giving killers my money, for some honey,

And a nose full of chowder, he's choppin' up all the doubters see

Not for attention for killing

Polo purple like the dope i'm hitting

Killing you bitches, pouring salt in you wounds

Walk into my room thinking how to make moves

Drugs, sex, killing and lots of madness

I can teach you all the sounds of love

Killing like every single beat,

If he does my soul to keep

No commentary my man, i come out swinging

So i say goodbye cause ma niggas killing



When your money stand tall bitches wanna know you but when your money

That bastard was buzzing like woody so we get it for free

Got a pocket full of cream, my moccasin's clean

Is money, drugs, hoes, violence washed up routine

And strangle you with that fucking leather jacket

Those bitches can burn in hell and contemplate satans shit

That mean im overflowin all you rappin niggas in cups

And he was married to my grandmother for money n drugs

Forget it its in the past memories pass i rather not rap about guns, drugs, and ass,

All i wanna do is sit back and watch you move and i'll proceed to throw this cash

Rap ki hui ending yo jo thi pandat k pyar ki hui happy ending

Martin luther i must’ve seenmixtape, mix ya body with tapethat’s what that green’ll bring

Do you think you'll ever get to the point where you can live

I got snider bitches that whiter than the drugs they sniff.

A Super  Kinda Gangsta
A Super Kinda Gangsta

An Original Song
by hezzy badass

He gets on with life as a gangsta,
He's a super kinda chap.
He likes shooting on Sundays,
He likes killing people in the week.
He likes to contemplate bitches.
But when he starts to daydream,
His mind turns straight to money.

Oh oh oh!

Does he love money more than bitches?
Does he love money more than bitches?

He likes to use words like 'badass,'
He likes to use words like 'sexy.'
He likes to use words about bitches.
But when he stops his talking,
His mind turns straight to money.

Oh oh oh!

Does he love money more than bitches?
Does he love money more than bitches?

He likes to hang out with tony,
He likes to kick back with rem,
But when left alone,
His mind turns straight to money.

Oh oh oh!

Does he love money more than bitches?
Does he love money more than bitches?

He's not too fond of haters ,
He really hates funny bitched,
But he just thinks back to money,
And he's happy once again.

Oh oh oh!
