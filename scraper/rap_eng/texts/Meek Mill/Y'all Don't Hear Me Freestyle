[Intro]
Yeah, Philly in this bitch!
Loso waddup?

[Verse 1]
I'm from a city where the skinny niggas ride
With a Semi .45, make the biggest niggas fold up, roll up
I dunn seen the realest niggas froze up
When that Mac squeezing hollows leave your back, leaking that
Decent if you want to, everytime I come through
Everybody whispering, talking what they gon' do
Hundred grand in straight cash don't make me put it on you
And have your own homies trying to swarm you, I'm sworn to
Riding with this Glock .40 and I got it on, too
They tell me to put it down, but they don't know what I'm going through
Niggas playing checkers, and this is chess
So what's a pawn to a king that nigga got his money right
You niggas on a hunger strike
When I was dead-broke, man I used to grind a hundred a night
A hundred a days selling white, I tell you it ain't nothing nice
I be going so hard, I don't see my son at night
Baby mama bitching, I'm just trying to get my young'un right
Started with a dollar, to a half a ticket
And I just signed my deal today for all you rapping niggas
Money ain't a joke, you see me laughing niggas?
All my goonies they ain't talking, they just clapping niggas
You gonna think my dog a roofer, brought a ladder with him
My other homie a mechanic, got his ratchet with him
And they shootin' for real, they shooting to kill
I got some homies upstate, they doin' a will
I remember niggas shooting for dear life
30 years on us, cops pulling the red lights
We riding with them hammers
Know a couple young'uns that died before their grandma
Trying to play with hammers
A lot of niggas fronted back when I was in the slammer
But, now I got that paper in, and I be going bananas
Like Tony the Montana, Nino and the Carter
Got me leaning even harder with this Nina in my cargoes
I can't meet em any farther if the niggas want the work
Tell em meet me out North, 20- something and Berks
Used to be with 50 niggas, 20 of em got murked
20 of them turned pussy, the other 10 put in work
Yeah! I'm screaming "this is the life"
If you ain't hoopin' then you whipping the white
Or either hitting the white
I talked to em try to give them advice
Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Yeah! Uh, niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Y'all don't really hear me tho
