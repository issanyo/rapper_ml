[Verse 1]
Rather eat crumbs with bums 'fore I split my steak with you snake ass niggas
I rather stay down with my day ones 'fore I come around you fake ass niggas
I rather have a broke real bitch 'fore I ever deal with y'all fake ass bitches
And I ain't with the flooding on the 'gram I don't really fuck with you, don't take my picture nigga
Posted on the corner with a 40 on my hip, Godzilla
We was getting to it when they hit my nigga Dean, that's when shit got realer
I was on the Southside really outside got guns got killers
Started from the bottom of the bottom now its bottles popping in the sky villa
Catch a body, be about it
I'm from where you couldn't talk you ain't be about it
I ain't really with the talkin', let's be G about it
When we catch you niggas slipping we gon' see about it
And these niggas get to talking like they know me
Finna turn me to the old me
Should've listened to my momma when she told me
Now these bitches throwing pussy cause they owe me

[Hook]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice, she popping pussy
Like I'm Uncle Luke
Cause I got the juice

[Verse 2]
Counting million dollars gon' fuck something
Put an eight up in my Phantom I don't want none
Nigga looking I don't tuck nothing
My nigga Ernie got thirty trying to slump something
I make the call to Arizona and the truck coming
Yeah, Papi, come dump somethin'
Bust them up we don't tuck nothing
Take a bird to the table we don't front nothing
I'm a north nigga at the end of the day
Gun butt a nigga with the end of the K
Kick you in your ass and send you away
Don't come around here like your niggas are safe
Cause all my hittas going bllllrrrt stick 'em
Fuck if you with 'em
Its money and murder if you fuck with my niggas
You come to my city I fucked all them bitches
I fucked all them bitches cause

[Hook]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice, she popping pussy
Like I'm Uncle Luke
Cause I got the juice

[Verse 3]
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Every time you ever saw me I was strapped nigga
Getting blunted in the back nigga
No this ain't a 550, this a Bach, nigga
Nigga prolly spend your car money on that act nigga
Couple bands, 5 racks nigga
You call it beefin' when you '@' niggas
We call it beefin' when we clap niggas

[Outro]
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice
Load up the chopper screaming R.I.P. Snupe
Bout to pop out the roof cause I got the juice
