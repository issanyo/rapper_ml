[Hook: Meek Mill]
Oh that's your girlfriend you better get her
Barry Bonds on the little ho cause I'mma hit her
I met her off Twitter
She brought her friends with her
Man the pussy so good nigga I cannot [?] her
Now Shawty throw it back shawty now throw it back
Shawty throw it back shawty now throw it back
Shawty throw it back shawty now throw it back
Everytime I look at her same time you throw it back like that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Now throw it back shawty pop a [?] with it
She see me standing there so she start playing with it
I said that ass fat I'm talking major with it
Shawty dropping them panties like I paid to get it
Leggo all this money over here better get some
Corners say they all back I tell them to pick one
I'mma take the lightskin pretty face and thick one
Red bone hair long shawty know she dead wrong
[?] with them pipes on trying to light them lights on
If she let me get it I'mma hit it with my ice on
Cause shawty she too hot
Beat it like a boombox
Tell drop it low she take way down to my tube sock
That's your girlfriend better get her
Barry Bonds bases loaded I'mma hit her
And if I get her dawg just forget her
Cause she gone knock her out the park

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Daddy-O]
Oh that's your girlfriend well I'm baggin'
So serious even though that I'm laughin'
Your man is a lame though he is not action
He's a chicken wing dip the thing [?]
Said I'm wearing [?] so right now we made a bet
I can see its going right but she think its going left
Say the less made a test
Sorry if I made a mess
Throw it up throw it back yes we are playing catch
Turn it up and let the beat knock
That's how she [?]
Been here since the classic I ain't talking Reebok
I'm a gentleman so I tell her can I please pop
I don't mean watch when I say she leave a G-Shock
Call me Dr. DickYourGirl that is what it fits in
When she feeling sick my dick is the prescription
[?]
Meek Milly tell them how its kicking
