[Intro: Sauce Walka]
Oh yeah, you want some, TSF DC niggas
Meek it's that time man we gotta move these fake niggas out the way man
The real is back, we winnin'

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
Oh yeah, I had to bomb on these niggas
I went Osama on niggas
I copped the Wraith out the dealer
I bought my bitch a Chinchilla
These niggas fake and we realer
Leave 'em outside in the winter
Bitch niggas hate on the winner
I'm winnin' and winnin' on niggas
I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning
I'm winning on niggas
I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning
I'm spending on niggas
I copped the Wraith out the dealer
I bought my bitch a Chinchilla
Fake niggas hate on the winner
Well fuck it, I'm winnin' on niggas

[Verse 1: Meek  Mill]
H-Town, H-Town
Young rich nigga, I just stay down
All these birdies like A-Town
Got her with her ass up face down, face down
Face down, face down
FILA like my playground
Go to club, drink, get chased 'round
I'm in Fifth Ward, me and J now
You givin' cash to these bitches
I give a splash to these bitches
I'm never trippin', my chick got more ass than these bitches
Prolly more cash than these niggas
I'm in my zone like I'm fuckin'
I'm gone get money, fuck bitches
Ballin' in Houston, with back to back rings
Like I was Olajuwon, call me (Hakeem)
I know what these bitches want
I know what these bitches need
She gone go and fuck a corney nigga for some money
Run it back to me
I'm in Houston with some Philly niggas
In the trenches with the Gs
Junior brought my nigga E
Sippin' dirty, me and three

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
Oh yeah, I had to bomb on these niggas

[Verse 2: Sauce Walka]
I bought the house out the bitch
She put the rocks on my wrist
I just bought a new bitch from the dealer
And she put the rest on my whip
I keep the Glock on my hip
My bitch keep a gun in that Birkin bag
Niggas hatin' and it's really sad
But we're spilling sauce that's the devil's swag
Jewelry worth half a milli
Drippin' sauce out in Philly
I'm with Fat Reese out in H-Town
Ain't no fuck niggas near me
Bought my (?)
Wearin' gold like a king
Now we eatin', stackin' lobsters but I still remember (?)
Hot dogs and the peas
Sleepin' by the dope fiends
Why they hatin' on me?
Cause we made it out the streets
I'm what these rap niggas wanna be
I can never be a wannabe
I'm spilling' this flavor it's all on me
I'm winnin' and spillin' all in these streets

[Hook: Sauce Walka]
Oh yeah, I had to bomb on these niggas

Bitch niggas hate on the winner
I'm winnin' and winnin' on niggas
I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning
I'm winning on niggas
I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning

I copped the Wraith out the dealer
I bought my bitch a Chinchilla
Fake niggas hate on the winner
Well fuck it, I'm winnin' on niggas

[Verse 3: Sancho Saucey]
Sauce God, I'm above a boss
Grab the sun and threw it in my mouth
Chop sticks all in my O's
Big Sanchie quick to knock a rapper off
Pull up to your studio with creatures
Got my tigers with me, they gon' eat ya
But I ain't askin' for no fuckin' feature
I'm just sendin' shots, baby that's on Jesus
Big (?) pimpin' that's on diva
Sauce gang baby, I'm the leader
Chasin' fast cash, I'm a cheetah
Stop the beat bitch, I need a breather
All the bitches do what I say
They caught me simon, all my diamonds smilin'
I just took a bitch to the island
I just put 17 in her vagina
I got bad bitches down in China
Chung-Lee I'm a street fighter
Sauce Twinz goin' back to back
Tryna steal my sauce? I ain't havin' that
I'm quick to shootin' like Action Jack
Sauce killa free my nigga Dre
Spillin' sauce what we had to do
Savin' the city like Dennis Gru
