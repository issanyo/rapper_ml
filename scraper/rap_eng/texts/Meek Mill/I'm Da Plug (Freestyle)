[Verse]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Ain't nobody tell 'em, this ain't what they want man
You ain't really write it, I'm like "who's your stuntman?"
Back to back, the Maybach, I be really stuntin'
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Steppin' out in blood, walkin' through the mud
We got all the guns and got all the drugs
I went and spent $250 on my cousin's case
To beat his body, shit I coulda bought a fuckin' Wraith
But now he home, I make him put you on the fuckin' plate
So many hundreds, got them bitches fallin' out the safe, ho!
Money make them bitches swallow everything
Bought my chick a rock, that shit look like a wedding ring
Out in Philly, I'm like Pablo in the Medellin
Hundred bricks, we got 'em bouncin' like a trampoline
36s, 28, we sellin' pizza, nigga
If you ain't starve with the Chasers, you ain't eatin' with us
Shit, they was tryna ride the wave, jetskiing niggas
But I'm so stuck up in my ways, I don't be with niggas
I don't know them guys, y'all believe them niggas?
Headbands and double parts, do y'all see them niggas?
We the type to run up on 'em, try to leave them niggas
We really started from the bottom, unlike, we them niggas
You took her to an island, I fucked her on a couch
I fucked her in the studio, she never seen my house
She told me that you're lame, I told her clean you out
I got that pussy same day she made you eat her out, woo!
Was that my girl's tour or the world tour?
I do not know what you pussy niggas goin' for
This that hundred K a night when you perform tour
Swimmin' in that good pussy while you're on tour, oh!
