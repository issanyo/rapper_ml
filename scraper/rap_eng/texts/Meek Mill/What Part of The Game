[Intro]
You know what I'm saying
Then a mahfucker get mad about these little niggas coming into the game
Not knowing what the fuck to do, have a fucking clue
Heard a couple of rap songs and seen a fucking couple of movies
And they think this is what the game is about
You know what I'm saying
So they give the game a black eye

I done taught you everything else you know about this shit right
Just be quiet for one time and listen

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Niggas snitching on their hommies getting them life
Still walking around like that shit is alright
But this is the life
Ya, what part of the game is that
Tell me what part of the game is that
Same niggas that rode for risking your life
Soon as you go upstate nigga hitting your wife
But this is the life
Ya, what part of the game is that
Tell me what part of the game is that

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They say loyalty brings forth royalty
The main reason y'all niggas is broke
The main reason when it go down you niggas will choke
That's why I leave my circle tight and keep my family close
It be the niggas that you trust though, cutthroat
Do you dirty and won't give a fuck though
Your luck though, same one's you ride for and die for
Stab you in your back you got your eyes closed
Thinking that its all love
All dabs, all hugs
They don't want to see you eat
They'd rather see all blood
Opening up all cuts
You was in the light
They was in the left lane and you was in the right
The difference is you say a nigga riding cause he down to pull a trigger
But a say a nigga riding when he down he send you pictures
Show you love dropping money on your kids
Now a days you go to jail they acting like you dead

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
You used to be a boss got indicted started snitching
All that money you was getting got a nerve to start bitching
Wasn't saying that when you was Louis luggage tripping
You and your chick styling spending thousands in the islands
But now you in a jam you couldn't ride with being silent
So you'd rather rat your hommie out coward
Got his baby mom stressing, kids growing up with out a father
Be the main niggas talking like they riding, selfish
Wouldn't bust a grape not if you hired them a Welch's
The type to leave a nigga in the fire watch him melting
I say what part of the game is that
Niggas telling on all their hommies how lame is that
Weak ass niggas gon' let the game collapse
That's why I'm spitting pain so I can help the game get back
And these niggas I ain't got nothing for them
Cause I'm real and I remember every nigga ain't loyal

[Hook: Meek Mill]
