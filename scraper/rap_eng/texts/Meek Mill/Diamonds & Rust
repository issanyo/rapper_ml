[Interlude 1]
It's easy to pull a trigger
But it ain't easy to move your mom out the hood
Thats a real man job
That ain't for suckas right there

[Intro]
11 years deep on the same streets
Now there's requirements to be an OG?
You gotta be with the smoking & drinking
& disrespecting all the women
Momma said stay away from all the sinning
Therefore I'd rather escape the system
Before I scamper with you chickens
I roll with the bosses like joe Biden
I ain't an OG but I know who is
And you ain't one
Emvm
Homie you a real one
I've been down so many times
With my day ones
Pull up on you if you had a bag
And we might take some

[Interlude 2]
I don't wanna be no goon nigga
I don't wanna be in dead
I don't wanna be in jail
I want a hundred fucking million

[Bridge]
We just hustlers we ain't robbers
Hustling for our mommas
Following what our prophet taught us
Our fathers weren't there to support us
They either got shot, locked up
Or didn't bother
The only child so I know I got to grind harder
Especially when my momma retire
Having visions of buying her new designer
Rolexes and audemars with the diamonds
I promise one day you will be shining
Momma I seen you struggle
I've seen you crying
Over my grandfather dying
That's why I'm striving

[Verse 1]
To stop the whining, this is so exciting
Like perfect timing
I'm writing this as I'm smiling
Cause their reaction to my rhyming
Was so surprising
Now I'm thriving for that signing
There's no more hiding
Rising from being silent
To know they riding is so reviving
I gave em guidance:
Stay as hungry as lions
And dodge the sirens
The best feeling is to see the fam laughing
Frightened when I see the fam fighting
My grandmother in the background crying
Her thoughts getting suicidal
After her husband died
She sees no point in surviving
All she wanted is to make it back to Palestine and
Get a land, build a crib, and be satisfied
But that can never happen
So all she can do is fantasize
That vision to her is prolly like paradise
No matter how much I do
I can't do enough, I apologize
But you religious and I believe that god
Is giving me all these signs
My birthdate a day after snupe
And a day before makaveli
DJ Khaled originates from the same place
Now please tell me I won't sell me a milli
I was born to be great, if I do
Ima bring the family with me

[Bridge]
No stage name so my father recognize me
Emphasize that it was unwise
To leave me behind
People ask about you
I tell em you ain't  alive
Because truthfully in my heart you died
Years ago when I realized I was livin a lie
Call my phone, I always decline
Text me, I never reply
Step sister met me once in her life time
Didn't want to speak to her
And she thought I was shy
I don't associate with you no more
That's a polite nasty way
Of saying good bye
Cuz you divided this family
And provided me with this life
But it's alright
Because now I'm the king of this jungle
Surviving this wild life

[Interlude 3]
I want to support you in being the Palestinian leader
Who signs his name to the final
And most important peace agreement
That brings safety, stability, prosperity
To both peoples
And to the region

[Verse 2]
Palestine where the sun never shine
And we the lions
Carbines ending children's lives
Mommas crying
Fighting for freedom and for peace
We striving
Daughter confronted a copper
She got hit with the choppers
Papa wanna call somebody
But there ain't no doctors
These monsters slaughter innocent walkers
We can't fight back and that is the problem
Yet they still got the nerve to call us the bombers
They still order to throw us in a cell
As if we robbers
But god is the greatest judge & he will end this madness
I can picture the peaceful scene as if I paint it on canvas
I pray that one day
This one day happens
When the sadness vanish
And the kids get chances
In advancing to the top classes
