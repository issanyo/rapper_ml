Yeah, nobody does it better

Verse 1:
Nigga all we do is win and it just begin
I do this for my moma and my daddy in the band
And now my real niggas who headed doubts to the end
When we was hard in the streets, come in and out of them sands oh
Uh, Im trying to make it to the top nigga
But my haters wanna see me on that block, nigga
Sending rocks, ‘cause they already know
When I get up in the game I’ma head the shit on luck nigga
Life is amazing, sand sounds crazy, niggas they wanna blaze me
I hate it because I made it
All I took is dedication and some motivation
They say ..over night, I was being patient
I’m thuggin every night, niggas tryin to take my life
House to gettin it’s illegal money like this shit is right
I gotta get it, ‘cause I’m trying to get fool rich
And I refuse to let my mama lose me till some bullshit

Verse 2:
I’ll be having dreams and nightmares, the fears were right there
My sneaks was guffed up, I needed them night airs
Them hoes they fronted on me, I needed the right kids
So I tought hustling, money was coming in
Cocaine pipe racks, the works I’m bubbling
Bitches was f*cking in, niggas turn cousin in
..and niggas around me, I need a f*ck within
Looking at the door, like who the f*ck let the double wind
Coast to coast we do the mostly toast
Sipping all in that ..yeah, started from right away
Now will be flying, the fifty is we levitate
Cutting through the dollar I make ..than heaven gate
The niggas forever hate, will get it, don’t ever wait
My niggas don’ t hesitate, you’re moving that medal quacker
Dead man, I had a message like a red man
None this bitches swearing on me like a head been

[Hook:]
