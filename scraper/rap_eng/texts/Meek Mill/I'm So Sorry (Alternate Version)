[Intro: Young Thug]
Getting money is a hobby, hobby, hobby
I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby

[Hook x2: Young Thug]
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Getting money is a hobby
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby

[Verse 1: Spenzo]
I'm so sorry I'm ahead of my time
Y'all lil' niggas ain't up on my level
I'm so sorry that they think I'm Illuminati
Young nigga so high you swear I'm worshiping the devil
I'm so sorry I never take a break
I'm too busy taking food off of niggas' plates
I can't even take my chick out on a date
I'm too busy making moves in another state
Man I'm so sorry, I'm so honest
I can see the future, you're gonna be a nobody
I'm so sorry I ain't know that was your girl
She came through and did the team chi-chi-chick like a thottie
I'm so sorry that I worth a Bugatti
And a brand new Ferrari at the same damn time
I'm so sorry that your girl din't pick up
She was too busy tryna bang my line, man
I'm so sorry I don't fuck with nobody
I'm just not anybody, I can't fuck with everybody
Who the fuck is you boy, you out your body
Beat a nigga down like 12 did Rodney
You know I got racks just like Yo Gotti
Kicks on my feet, looking like I know karate
When I'm on a track, nigga, I'mma catch a body
Call the producer tell him I'm so sorry, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Maine Man]
Nigga I'm a god come pray to me
Play your cards don't play with me
This my hobby like trading cards
Trade your place but don't trade with me
Might have to stick for probation b
Feds be watching location tweets
Man them lawyer fees cost a grip
Hit you with the stick PlayStation Wii
I'm hot like bodies on that gun
She pop that molly on her tongue
I mix that cocaine with soda I mix my Coca-Cola with rum
I keep on chewing niggas like gum
I'm so sorry I had to go dumb
Send my [?] through [?] boxes [?]
Ya that's a fumble young man rumble
Smoking on all kind of trees in the jungle
She on my balls she might as well hum
And the ball in my court but I still stay humble
Man she blowing me like a trombone
But I cut her off cause she cut though
I'm so sorry for the wave, if it wasn't for the wave I'd be like where's Waldo

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, pockets all fat like Terio
Cus we sellin' O's like cheerios
Off the rope on your ho Rey Mysterio
Let the beat build bitch now here we go
Hol' up, it ainâ€™t even drop yet
But I'm ridin' in the coupe with the top back
Got that slidin' round with the seat dropped back
Gettin' head till I tell the hoes to stop that
Catch me club liv with a 34
Naw you ain't ready dawg
Hoes tryin to hit the bank like set it off
Spit crack but eyes already raw
Rock ready, ready rock ho let it pause
Nigga you don't ever ball
Ho changed for the money like menopause
So what I do treat them hoes like Santa Clause
Hey ho Meek Milly got gifts for a
I heard homie got this for ya
They got that so I'ma give the dick to ya
And if you do it good I'ma give a tip to ya
Drip to ya bust it open on the eyelid
You clocked out right around the time I signed in
Now shorty wanna kick it like Chi Lin
Cus I pull strings like a violin

[Hook]

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I used to pray to get a hundred grand
Now it's cartiers for the rubber bands
And that uzi sounded just like [?] man
Did I, did I, did I, did I stutter fam
