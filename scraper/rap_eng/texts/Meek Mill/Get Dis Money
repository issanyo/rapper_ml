[Chorus: All Star]
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Staying on my grind and stack it straight up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, the early bird get the worm first
Sixteen, we was out there on that curb first
With a quarter trying to see who get a bird first
Like fuck a undercover cop who getting served first
Yeah we was dead wrong but we had to learn first
We ain't give a fuck whoever fronted us got burnt first (Yeah)
We like we gone get this paper
My shooters was trying to kill, I'm like we gone get 'em later
Trying to turn a dollar bill into a pretty situation
Just thinking bout them benjis got a nigga in the matrix
Waiting, losing patience my mind racing
Plus my seed growing so you know I need dough and...

[Chorus: All Star]
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Staying on my grind and stack it straight up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yo, I used to smoke my lil L
Thinking bout my master plan
Trying to get a million fucking dollars out of half a man
Cause being broke got a nigga feeling like a half a man
We gone get this money though
We just in a traffic jam
And I want to live the fast life
Fast cars, fast bitches, fast money, fast bike
I was in the dark, shit that money was like a flashlight
Cause I started shining same day I got my stash right (uh)
This money ain't a joke
Homies looking like snakes
They was cool when I was broke
But now I'm gettin money
They looking at me funny
That's why I keep my heater
Cause I never been a sleeper

[Chorus: All Star]
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Staying on my grind and stack it straight up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Look, I'm a get rich or die tryin'
If gettin money was sinnin', fuck it I'm fryin'
If I'm lying I'm flyin',I'm bucking my iron
If a nigga try to take, I'll knock somethin out his face
I go in and out of state, up and down 95
Just to get it for my niggas put my life on the line
They want what I got, they'll never get it from me (never)
But we gone get this money

[Chorus: All Star]
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Staying on my grind and stack it straight up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
When I wake up, first thing on my mind is get this cake up
Ain't no time to sleep I gotta stay up
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
We gon' we gon' we gon' get this money
