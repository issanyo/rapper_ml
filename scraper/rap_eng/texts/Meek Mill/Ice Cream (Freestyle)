[Intro]
The kid is back uh , turn me up Cruz

[Verse1]
The revolution shall be televised
This year it's all about us so fuck the other side
Gotta get killed on camera for us to come alive
Well shit we dead already from all this homicide
In my cell hangin' from a rope
Where you get less time for rape than for sellin' dope
When you get the same time for dope then you do a murder
Innocent 'til guilty, guilty the verdict
Before you even started that Harley, no we ain't notice
Cause we was goin' to war with ourselves over that coca
And they was tryna hurt us, lock us so far in the mountains
Couldn't get no service and our families couldn't service us
Fightin' a silent war with a silencer
Like racin' a Lamborghini with a Challenger
And the feds gon' follow us
Label us as terrorists and then they drop bombs on us
And we turn to media, they lie to us
Nobody really speakin' on them courtrooms that bodied us
Labeled us as hooligans, we trappin' and we movin' it
Kids barely eatin' at that table with that tuna fish
Breakfast and lunchtime Mama ordered the noodle dish
Dinner time I was on the corner, me and Lucifer
Who you s'posed to call when the cops the ones shootin' you?
Nobody
Talked to the Shmurdas and I told 'em keep their head up
And when you touch down, stay focused and get your bread up
Cause when you're gettin' to it the people be gettin' fed up
They buildin' brand new jails for us, don't make your bed up
Use your head, dog, and beware
Certain niggas just ain't good for you dont bring them near ya
I'm young, black, and I get money, my swag serious
America's worst nightmare, I'm what they're scared of
Fresh back home, they had to sit me down
I come back home, they talkin' Nicki now?
I spit like a drummer that hold 50 rounds
And for my walkthroughs it cost 60 pounds
Of Sour D, Hollywood, I should be
But that hood shit bring the hood out of me
I be on the 'gram like I hit the lottery
Buyin' every car, every house I see, tryna be
A gangsta, I was tryna be a king
You're tryna score a point, I was tryna get a ring
Couple niggas got happy, heard I was in the bing
'Til they let me out my cell, I jumped right up in that sink
Balenciaga red interior, they're inferior
I made a couple milli in jail, I'm dead serious
Monkey ass hoes like George and head curious
Flow so wavy man I should've been an aquarius
I'm talkin' to Hov on the jail call
Get so many letters that they thinkin' it's mail fraud
When I fell on the money they said that I fell off
We got like, 6 mansions, 12 lofts
3 condos, any apartments? Hell naw
Just all penthouses, nigga I've been 'bout it
Gets in, gets out it, like it's a robbery
I came up from the bottom and ain't no stoppin' me nigga
