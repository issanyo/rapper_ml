[Pre-Chorus: Meek Mill]
Started out hustling OZs
Young niggas muscling OGs
Mixing the purp with the codeine
I’m feeling like I’ma OD
I’m feeling like I'm the old me
Never let money control me
Only good pussy console me
Tell her swallow me up for your protein

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Now we getting this money, my niggas is balling
Like never before, like never before
And now that we on it, these bitches is fucking
Like never before, like never before
We get to that paper, and get those hoes later
But never before, but never before
They said we wouldn’t make it, but now we the favorite
Like never before, like never before

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Fuck what you heard my nigga, I’m on the curb my nigga
Like never before
Selling the birds my nigga, get served like church’s chicken
Like never before
I know you heard my nigga, I got the work my nigga
That you told them people bout shit that’s illegal
That’s only gone lead to a murder nigga, get murdered nigga
I been out clocking since 8, money what’s coming my way
Hey, hey, tucking my gun on my waist
I give a fuck bout a case

[Verse 2: Kur]
All these hoes got ulterior motives
Me and D-Jack in his Wraith doing donuts
I keep on pouring purp all in the soda
Bitches be on me, this shit 'til is over
Got on these Masions, hoes call me a mason
Listen, bitch I am not into dating
I’m just into fucking, are you into sucking?
Are you into chasing? I just want to break you down
We had the pills and the reggie, we’ll break it down
Undies was stankin' out, we move that pack
We did not fucking hesitate, we was not wasting time

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Now we getting this money, my niggas is balling
Like never before, like never before
And now that we on it, these bitches is fucking
Like never before, like never before
We get to that paper, and get those hoes later
But never before, but never before
They said we wouldn’t make it, but now we the favorite
Like never before, like never before

[Verse 3: Kur]
I’m in Los Angeles
I’m having thoughts about jamming shit
So tired of scrambling, not a good arguer
Not with the back and forth, we leaving shit candle lit
And if it’s a problem, I know how to handle it
I’m not into panicking, rappers be pussys
I’m bout to extort em and rob all they cameramen
My bitch got pretty ass feet, got the double C on em
Her sandal shit, buy her this brand new shit
I’m tryna milk her for 35 hundred, the re-up on ammo shit
Tryna throw keys like piano man, they took my flow and they ran with it
Don’t understand this shit
I don’t give a fuck about nothing my nigga
We really was down and shit
If it’s a problem you know I’m right at you
We leaving shit stiff as a statue
I’m in LA and I’m chilling with Meek
This nigga’s house got a motherfucking chapel
So, we swerving all in this Bent
Oh, the guts it look like an apple
Wow, I got this MAC and it’s full
Just in case they try to tackle

[Pre-Chorus: Meek Mill]
Started out hustling OZs
Young niggas muscling OGs
Mixing the purp with the codeine
I’m feeling like I’ma OD
I’m feeling like I'm the old me
Never let money control me
Only good pussy console me
Tell her swallow me up for your protein

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Now we getting this money, my niggas is balling
Like never before, like never before
And now that we on it, these bitches is fucking
Like never before, like never before
We get to that paper, and get those hoes later
But never before, but never before
They said we wouldn’t make it, but now we the favorite
Like never before, like never before
