[Intro]
Closing up shop and locking doors
Turning up lost in some unknown
Silence so mighty you go deaf
Bombs are going off inside your chest

[Verse 1]
All my niggas real and All your niggas fake
Yo' bitch she on me, got her wet like the lake
I'm in New York just cooling eating steaks
They all on my dick like rondo "Why you drop the rakes?"
Cuz the Bricks is the jakes
I'm riding with the 8, make one move six shells to your face
Bitch I'm first place, pussy boy you late
I'm eating everything, a whole feast on my plate
A lot of niggas hate, a lot of niggas snakes
I saw you niggas shake when I pulled up in that May
Spray you with that K, spray you with that K
Because the K leave you erased have 'em gone outer space
They took my bro L'A, They took my bro J-Money
We on that shit, having us flap like some zombies
All you niggas funny, all you niggas bummy
Put the nine to your tummy, let it chew you like your gummy
I gotta eat I'm hungry
I can't sleep I'm up
Riding in the black truck, ready to fuck shit up
All my niggas up, all your niggas down
Tell them give me crown, becaue I don't fuck around
I gotta eat right now, I gotta eat right now
Alot of niggas clowns, And I dont make a sound
I just move myself around, away from the crowd
The crowd get shot down, and I don't get shot down
I do hits then leave town, I hit stains on pounds
I donâ€™t party at lounge, I don't get drunk bitch
I'm off the skunk bitch, I don't give a fuck bitch
I don't knuckle up bitch, You'll get shot quick
See you on my block bitch, You will get shot quick, around my block bitch

[Outro]
