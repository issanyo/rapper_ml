Said you won't change you went and changed i fuckin knew it
Can't get a range its out of range im stickin to it
I got my niggas a lot of niggas debatin on me
Start chasing money i look around and got bitches on me
I get more love from people that dont even really know me
Pass me the ball im on the court an im ballin like kobe
You say you get more money nigga you gone have to show me
I looked outside eye balled a cop and asked why they patrolling
They said we out here cuz you niggas keep killing each other
Take care my mom i love my sisters and all of my brothers

Ain't paper chasin? im paper chasin i gotta get it
Yall gotta speak up on the truth this ain't dissin its business
I got the 9 up on my hip if you play with my riches
Say theres plenty fish in the sea i ain't tryna go fishin

Picked up a pen and a pencil an i just started writing
I put the pen to the paper i pedaled to the metal

Look i ain't got time for niggas i wanna sit back uh

They just wanna get rid of me how niggas be your friend then
Later on turn to yo enemies
