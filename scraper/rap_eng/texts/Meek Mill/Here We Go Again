[Hook: Meek Mill]
Here we go again (x6)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
In the Bent fitted to the back
Pull up to the club then we get into the back
Shawty show me love she let me get it from the back
And if I hit it from the back hommie you won't get her back
I say my swagger on metro
Limited with that though
My pockets like a gecko
Greener shit I [?]
Check a nigga like FEMA
If he try it he's a dreamer
I done fucked with Christina to Fatima to Karina
Rollie on my wrist Rollie on that bitch
She rolling on that shit we about to roll up out this bitch
Got that Rover out that bitch and we roll out to my [?]
I let her roll out to my crib then she rolling on my dick
Now she stuck in a dilemma Kelly Rowland out that bitch
Tell Omelly to roll over we start rolling on that bitch
And we roll up on that shit
Frutie roll up in that bitch
And we get higher than a fucking roller coaster out this bitch
My flow it ain't no stupid its retarded
You can't stand it why you start it
I go harder than the hardest
I'm hotter than wasabi copy
I be in Bally's prolly out in Cali
With Charlie out in the Mazi
I'm Louied down to the ground
My lay be browner than Bobby
I might just give them Cavalli with diamonds all on my body
The city respected highly
My chick be hotter than Halle
I see that you heard about me
Don't care then don't worry about me

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
I can see the madness
These niggas mad cause we get that cash
And stacking caddy wagon look like a Magnum
We add them making these haters sick to their stomach
Nigga [?] stunting and balling, balling and stunting
Man them biddies be like who is he
Check up on my Louie V
Check up on my Louie shirt, Louie belt, Louie sneaks
Ask if I'm fresh yes
Vest to protect chest
Hell raiser sitting in the Trail Blazer SS
Nigga super sport 'bout to chirp out
Niggas hitting shit and they got that work out
On your mark get set we getting ready
All these niggas loose bunch of spaghetti
I be popping my banger holding it steady
I be throwing the thirty we rain heavy here
Nigga anywhere every block anywhere
Letting the semi pop burn his chest like a Henny shot
Blasting, busting his top watching his [?]
Asking, I be like Arnold baby whats happening
Cracking, Rollie face studded its just a flashing
Fashion, D&G skully matching my jacket
Aston, sitting on 20's white as a napkin
Cracking, we got it popping baby what's happening
The 8 ball, taking scrape off
Fuck a shoe box I need a safe like baseball
Let my tool pop, knock off his face and take off
A maroon drop, niggas can't see me like Ray Charles
When the moon drop, goons rise them tools bought
Niggas getting it popping they busting them tools off
Halfwayed out in a halfway house
But its like I'm halfway in but I'm halfway out
I swear that's its a blessing to be halfway out
But [?] I be right back in
I said halfway in halfway out
Got to make my curfew I can't be halfway in
Cause if I'm halfway in then I'm halfway out
Then the warrant unit gon' take my right back in
