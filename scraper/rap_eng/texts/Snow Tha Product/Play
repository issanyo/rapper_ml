[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
This one's for y’all if y’all want it
This one for la raza, bitch it don’t stop
'Til 4, 5, 6 in the mornin'
'Til somebody’s uncle sings 'til he drops
Now I rap for y’all and y’all know it
But goddamn, do I get hate and shit
Maybe ‘cause I’m Mexican and I be wreckin' shit
Steppin' and definitely bringin' 'em a little change to this
Man, I come from where they run from
‘Cause this ain’t ASAP and the pesos don’t last for shit
A conundrum up in them slums
Man, I’m proud of my people who be tryna get to Carlos Slim
‘Cause I know y’all tired of bein' pacifist
I’m running up with hella gats and I’m blasting shit
So get back and get attacked and get that, you bitch
‘Cause if you tryna fuck with us then you a masochist
Mira cabron, conmigo no te metas guey
Yo te voy a enseñar que conmigo no es okay
Poneme algun commentario que el ritmo es gay
Que no mato la liga con mi mixtape
There's always some dumb bitch with some shit to say
But a latina finna get up in here and hit the game
So you can hate, you can say shit but we gon' stay
Snow White tell them hating bitches fix your face

[Hook]
We rolling up, pouring drinks
Let them haters hate
They know what’s up, know we in here
They know we don’t play, don’t play
Don't play, don't play, don't play
Hold up, wait a minute, make them speakers shake
We showing up, pouring up
Tell my DJ hit play, hit play
Hit play, hit play, hit play
(Wake ya game up!)

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
This one for the kickbacks in apartments
Man, fuck the neighbors and fuck the cops
If they don’t want none, don’t talk shit
From the VIP in the club to the parking lot
I got a crew of belligerents that's unorthodox
And it all went downhill when we poured them shots
We poured one, four, six, twenty, fuck
I can’t even afford it all
Around here these bouncers don’t play
Been drinking Monster all day
Feel big as Ricky Rozay
But I’m five-foot-three on a good day
Ok, I’m feeling Patrón ay pero dice mi novia to phone home
But my girl in here telling me don’t go
Pitbull in the back like bon bo-bon bon

[Bridge]
Where- where my fellas in here getting stacks? Throw 'em
Where- where my women in here with the racks? Show 'em
Ay, what you doing in the back? Where- where you going?
Haters talking, stepping, it's a rap, hold up

[Hook]
We rolling up, pouring drinks
Let them haters hate
They know what’s up, know we in here
They know we don’t play, don’t play
Don't play, don't play, don't play
Hold up, wait a minute, make them speakers shake
We showing up, pouring up
Tell my DJ hit play, hit play
Hit play, hit play, hit play
(Wake ya game up!)
