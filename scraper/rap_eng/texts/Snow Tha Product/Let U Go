[Chorus]
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go

[Verse 1]
You the worst, swear that you the worst
Wasted time with you, I should've been worried 'bout me first
I was a loner, headphones loud as marijuana, yeah
I get your text and I reply within a second
Then you left the shit on "read" and hit me hours later
Claiming you thought you fucking sent it
I was on one
Strung out on your love but now it's over, yeah
Fuck you and fuck the time that I wasted
I hope that you get fired on your fuckin' break and
I hope your L's expire, and your registration
I hope they pull you over next time you been drinkin'
I hope your new bitch fuck your boys and your dad, hey!
So when he finally in your life it's for a bad day
I hope your landlord finds out that you share with five dudes
And you get evicted, followed by some other bad news

[Chorus]
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go

[Verse 2]
Look, fuck off, really, fuck off
Had me slippin' on my pimpin', get up and then dust off
Enough is enough, I don't play that shit
You can't afford to pay me attention, then say that shit
Go ahead, give it to your bitches, go on, play pretend
Post your lil' memes, claim the life that really isn't
All this time I just played the fool, now it's time for major moves
All that time I thought you was the one, yeah, yeah
Trippin' on you
Slippin' on my funds yeah, yeah
Got my heart stolen by a bum yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you seen him, better run yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All that time I thought you was the one, yeah, yeah
Trippin' on you
Slippin' on my funds yeah, yeah
Got my heart stolen by a bum yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you seen him, better run yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go
Had me crying all night long
Had me slipping on my money, money
Had to focus on my own
That's why I let you go

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let you go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let, let, let, let, let, let, let you go

[Outro]
That's why I let you go
All night long
M-m-money, money
On my own
That's why I let you go
All night long
M-m-money, money
On my own
That's why I let you go
All night long
M-m-money, money
On my own
That's why I let you go
All night long
M-m-money, money
On my own
