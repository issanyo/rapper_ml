Pum-Pumba are you nuts?

[Verse 1: Lex The Great]
Don't get mad at me, I don't love 'em
I just fuck 'em, I don't know who wanna cuff 'em
I replace 'em with another one

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Say it loud for the back
I got a bunch of [?] subbing
They be in they feelings, running round
No wonder why I don't fuck with 'em

[Verse 3: Castro Escobar]
Mhm, I don't know 'bout y'all
Respect women '17 for me
Need a lady that can cook and that can clean for me
Want a lady that could come and that could be my queen

[Verse 4: Snow Tha Product]
Man, I got a bitch that made a scene for me
I got a Puerto Rican baby daddy that's a trump supporter
Ex bitch thirst trapping and she need a glass of water

[Verse 5: Lex The Great]
Yo Snow, I'ma have to change this up just like a quarter
You about to make somebody catch a case
Law & Order

[Verse 6: Castro Escobar]
Whoa
Yeah, we need to calm down fo' sure
We been drinking every day and 'bout to go on tour
We ain't even drop the best that we have in store
But when we do then best believe that we gon' wild out more

[Verse 7: Snow Tha Product]
Man
[?]

[Verse 8: Lex The Great]
Man this puto drama [?] coraz√≥n
You don't got no feelings [?]

[Verse 9: Snow Tha Product]
I mean, maybe you right
Then again maybe you wrong
Lately I just feel like [?]
And I mean ugh what a shame, what a shame
My WCW don't like me

[Verse 10: Castro Escobar]
Oh yeah, same Snow same
I was about to make the bitch wifey
Now I got two bitches in the 'Lac
Asking when I'm coming back
Got another one that's texting me like "Where the fuck you at?"
Got another that called me, I ain't bout to call her back
Got so many nowadays that I ain't even keeping track

[Verse 11: Snow Tha Product]
I got two bitches in the 'Lac
Each flipping through a stack
Yelling "Jesus take the wheel!"
But I be stepping on the gas
They be loving single Snowy, so the Henny back on tap
Not a waste of time, but time is money bitch so give me cash
