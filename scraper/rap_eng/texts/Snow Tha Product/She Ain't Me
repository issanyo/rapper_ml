[Hook]
There we go again, yea yea
Bragging to your friends, friends friends
Talking bout that hood rat, chick that
I seen you with before
And like you would what
I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me

She she she, she ain't me me
She she she ain't me
She she she ain't me
She ain't me

[Verse 1]
I bet you think it, drives and be crazy
When I see you with a bunch of chicks
But it's quality over quantity baby
And they ain't even close to this
I'm the best you had, I'm best you get
So it's all downhill after this
Boy you can date all the boppers in the world
Cause I'm positive this girl is the one you'll never forget
Cause I'm a motherfuckin swag out, Prada bag out, little shopper
Bet a million, that you won't find another hotter
Little hot spitter with a gazillion offers
Had a gold mine but you was out chasing copper

[Bridge]
So my phone stay ringing, folks stay grinning
Cause everybody know that you're losing bro
When you broke lil women, you're so not winning
I'm disappointed cause you keep choosing hoes

[Verse 2]
I know that you reminisce
And you probably wishin that it was different
And I know that you thinkin about what could've been
Now you gotta deal with that instead of this
Cause I guarantee you I was the realest chick
Never hold you with, now we're so different
Little scally wag hologram, all these bad hoes
Holy crap, I bet I could pull a better bitch

[Hook]
There we go again, yea yea
Bragging to your friends, friends friends
Talking bout that hood rat, chick that
I seen you with before
And like you would what
I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me

[Verse 3]
Think I seen you approach then what's happening
And you try to play it off like you happy babe
But I know if you really were, you wouldn't call me then
I know you wouldn't have deleted all that commentents
Cause you sharing my shit, you sure be textin
You sure be all over my post and my pics
I know you know it, just none of your bizz
If you was really happy, you sure don't make sense
Cause I know you seen that new car I bought
And you text me and notice that I'm working out
Since we broke up you frequent the bar a lot
And you stressin me, what the hell you worry bout?

[Bridge]
Cause my phone stay ringing, folks stay grinning
Cause everybody know that you're losing bro
When you broke lil women, you're so not winning
I'm disappointed cause you keep choosing hoes

[Verse 4]
See I know you know that you're messing up
Cause you went from the best to just decent chicks
And it's funny when my home girls said you dumb
You realized while she was talkin and you see an in
You ain't got much to say so you plea the 5th
And you startin to see the thing about freedom is
It's not worth it when you had it perfect
Certain chick and I believe that was me

[Hook]
Here we go again, yea yea
Bragging to your friends, friends friends
Talking bout that hood rat, chick that
I seen you with before
And like you would what
I see you and I know we both know that she ain't me

She she she, she ain't me me
She she she ain't me
She she she ain't me
She ain't me yea yea
She ain't me
She ain't me yea yea
She ain't me
She...
