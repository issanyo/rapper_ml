No lie... (Lie...)
No lie... (Lie...)

[Verse 1]
Blame it on the hard day I guess
But I been thinking 'bout the day I met
Women's intuition that the bitch ain't shit
I ain't even question bout where y'all went
Since that time is whatever
Now we got a kid and only reason we together
Don't be in my phone and asking questions 'bout whoever
Don't be trippin', I ain't trippin', ain't nobody jealous

[Hook]
And I told your ass
You know I would tell you if I was fuckin' with somebody on the side
No lie, no lie (No lie, no lie)
No lie, no lie (No lie)
If we having our issues and I'm feeling like I need to confide
No lie (No lie)
No lie (No lie)


[Verse 2]
No Lie I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya
I don't gotta pretend, you know damn well
You and I been together since whenever
Love and hate is both the same, it's four letters
You was lying and I found out y'all was more than just friends and though
You coulda told me but you kept it low
I thought a mans word meant something but mine meant more 'cause

[Hook]
You know I would tell you if I was fuckin' with somebody on the side
No lie, no lie (No lie, no lie)
No lie, no lie (No lie)
If we having our issues and I'm feeling like I need to confide
No lie (No lie)
No lie (No lie)

[Verse 2]
I don't gotta lie
I am not a guy
I don't gotta keep it on the down low
I could hurt your pride
I could hit you right where it hurt and kick you when you're down low
See you dudes be saying all these things
Got a bitch in line while she waiting for a ring
Claim a man is just a man unless she tryna maintain
But you get up in your feelings when she do the same thing
Oh you had a slip up, it ain't mean shit
Hit you with the you ain't loyal if you leave shit
Men be dogs and pressing women to be decent
And have her workin', cookin', cleanin', and you be creepin'
And have a side bitch cause she always on her knees and she can keep a secret, don't trip when you leave and, maybe cause you not the only one the bitch sleep with, and the ho don't got a house and kids to be feedin'

[Hook]
You know I would tell you if I was fuckin' with somebody on the side
No lie, no lie (No lie, no lie)
No lie, no lie (No lie)
If we having our issues and I'm feeling like I need to confide
No lie (No lie)
No lie (No lie)
