[Intro]
I know that you don't smoke
But you know I got that fire
And I'll be good to go
I don't even gotta light up

[Verse 1]
One shot for the chick with the cash
Ain't scared to be independent
I just hopped in the whip and I dipped real quick
And I think Imma have to pay you a visit
I've been drinking a bit in the club
Got with the team and we living it up
Thinking of you and what happened to us
Cause when I say "fuck it," I don't give a fuck
I just say that, say that, say that, say that
Love it how you don't take that, take that, take that, take that, take that
Cause I know you mad
But if you see me, your attitude might change up
I know it's bad, but if you sleepy I'm hoping you might wake up

[Hook] x2
Babe I've been throwing up (throwing up)
Rolled a blunt (rolled a blunt)
Popped a bottle (popped a bottle)
Slowed it up (Slowed it up)
I'm about to show you what you like (what you like)
I'm about to show you what you like (what you like)

[Verse 2]
Might've overdone it with the liquor
What do you expect from the girl from "Drunk Love"?
I'm bad at relationships, I play 'till it's too late
And I hit you with the "Wassup?"
Same shit - you fuck up, I get fucked up
Then your number get clocked and I run up
My pedestal, cause you been this full
Of shit, since the day I met you when I was young
And I used to fall for your stuff
But now I'm grown enough to know - fuck trust
I just really have to hit you when I'm buzzed up
Numb the feeling and deal with the rush of
Just hitting you up, picking you up
You leave your car and you'll get in my truck
We get away for a week and a month
Then drop you off like I don't give a fuck
But I say that, say that, say that, say that
Love it how you don't take that, take that, take that, take that, take that
Look I've been hella tired of this drama on the low
But if you free tonight, I got a spot that we can go

[Hook]
