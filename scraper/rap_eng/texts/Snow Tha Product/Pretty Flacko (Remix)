[Intro]
Yo, I don't even know what to say
I guess, um...
I dont know.. what?
I'm back

[Verse]
Well if isn't that cute itty bitty mamacita
That gets hard like tequila
Got sick bars off that ether
Hot shit all off your meter
Yo bitch fall of the seat
Cause she ain't never witness no one fresher
I'm over stuff in my dresser
Miss Fine 'gon rap in (?)
Now let me get up again cause I've been missing too long
I've been gone and I think they getting too comfortable
With these stupid little women
You ain't really about beef, you chicken soup
..Surprise bitch..
What's happening? It's time in
I'm back again, I'm writing, let me grab a pen
And let me a little throw like a javelin
My pockets looking chubby, must be all them carbs
You would think that I bake, the way I be getting cake just like a boss
And I got this bitches lost, see none of them knew I'm coming back
And all of a sudden I'm coming and I got 'em running all from me and I'm gunning and where the hell are they fucking now?
