Motherfuckers wanna turn on me?
All of a sudden I took it like a cold... (?)
What you trynna learn off me?
Man, I've been telling them I've been doing this shit since birth, please
I've been trynna serve y'all fiends
Now it's just lookin like imma have to ride shoddy in the hurst seat
Cause I could've sworn I've been killin' em all since '09 with my dope rhymes
I don't think they heard me
See before you wasn't what you now pretend to be
All of a sudden bitches coming out of the vicinity
Style switched up, hyped up, with a hint of me
Little bit of something else, fuck a wannabe
I'm the same chick, same clique, with some Hennessy
Now I look around and see a bunch of mini me's
Fuck around and you'll end up like a Kennedy
Snow Tha Product, you couldn't even fucking get a key
Run tell that bitch I did em like that
Came right back and I got em off track
Told you way back when I didn't have cash
That I swore to god it wouldn't never go back
But just like they asked, they all wanna take shots
Swore like a chick don't got it on lock
Hope you stand heat cuz you're finna get hot
Trynna be up in the mix, better get up out my pock'
Cuz if you even wanna diss, then I'll take it as a shot
Better have a set of clips cuz it's gonna take a lot
For a skinny little bitch to be having all that talk
Better know that this shit is really finna pop
I got this, walk it like I talk it
I profit, y'all don't even really profit
Y'all chicks, know the line if you cross it
Y'all been, really looking for an option
I've been, trying to do me but it's obvious
Y'all been, bringing me up as a topic
Stop it! cuz you be lovin what I'm droppin'
Jock it, now you really just a copy
Plotting? walk it
Y'all bitches wanna talk shit? chop at y'all bitches like a doxin
But this my shit and imma lock it
Probably I got this
I got enough style to suffice all you thirsty bitches
If you're gonna bite, swallow, if not, imma get offended
Said I got enough style to suffice all you thirsty bitches
If you're gonna bite, swallow, if not imma get offended, hoe
