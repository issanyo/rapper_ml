[Verse 1]
You're a bitch
You're a liar
Watch what you saying to me
Girl why you playin?

You ain't shit
And I'm tired of trying
I hope you playin baby
Cause I can say that you a bitch
And I'm tired

You runnin' round on me
You knew I was down, but this is it
Boy I'm tired
Been lookin around, and baby
You ain't got the juice no more

[Hook]
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around, and
You ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around, and
Cause you ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more

[Verse 2]
Why you acting brand new?
Why you acting brand new?
You knew you was the first one that I chose to ride in my coupe
Bump your brakes, it ain't cool
You selfish and you rude
All you did is waste time
And now I'm calling a truce
Go and fuck other dudes
Slept on me, it's cool
You was with all the "Snooze"
Girl you ain't paint a muse(yeah)
What's new is the moo(yeah)
My new girl coming through(yeah)
She know what she came to do
She know what she came to do

So why you grabbing my waistline?
Calling me all on Facetime
Talking about that I'm "fine as wine"
Oh you heard through the grapevine
Now you talking bout "who?"
Put up on me like oou
Pick me up in a brand new whip, and baby
You ain't got the juice no more

[Hook]
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around, and
You ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around, and
Cause you ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more

[Verse 3]
Look
You thought
You got, it like that
But you don't, so the text that you sent me at 3am ain't shit cause you seen my pic on the 'gram, you a lurk ass bitch
Couldn't even like this shit or comment cause your chicks
That you still got playing little games, be pissed
I've been doing something you can no longer do (me)
Still see Snow still got the juice (yee)
You so ungrateful
I tried to save you
Hoes do what hoes gonna do (cheat)

Ok, so hoes do what hoes gonna do
You've been lying
You've been cheating too
Fucks wrong with you?
You ain't got the juice no more

[Chorus]
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around, and
You ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more
No more cryin', I opened my eyes
And I've been around
Cause you ain't got, you ain't got
You ain't got the juice no more

[Outro]
I mean like...
I don't hate you, like I wouldn't like run you over but like... (man)
You just don't got it like that no more (yeah, yeah whatever)
And like...
I mean, I guess like...
