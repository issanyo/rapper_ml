Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real (uh huh)
I'm runnin' out of time
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real
Real, real

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Driving, catchin' flights and gettin' it (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I fucked around and caught myself some feelings (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause if you really want this tell me now (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got my flight i'm runnin' out of time (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You say can't wait on me
Came for one night but I stayed a week
Met a lot of people but they ain't like me
I been fuckin' with you like I ain't gon' leave
And I can make you feel alright (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me know if i'm wrong or right (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real (uh huh)
I'm runnin' out of time
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real

[Verse 2: AJ Hernz]
Tell me is it really real (real)
I'm startin' to see how you feel
I don't mind payin' the price
But you gotta tell me the deal
I'm the one payin' the bills
And you the one spendin' the bills
And i'm here just keepin' it trill
You don't tell me how you feel
I find myself on your time
When i'm takin' you shopping
Not patient, I once was
That's why I skipped college
Turned tuition to a profit
Bought a truck with low mileage
But you treat me like an option
And I don't want to be your hobby, yeah

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real (uh huh)
I'm runnin' out of time
It is for real (uh huh)
It is for real
Real, real
