[Verse 1]
Walk in, club packed, and I'm feeling myself
This young chick look good from my hair to my nails
Everybody staring seem to know me quite well
Cause I'm looking so hot, you boys' ice might melt
Plus I heard ya boy like it when I'm speaking Spanish
Got him on the wall, hoping he can handle it
He know that no one do it better than a Latin chick
So when I drop it, the situation gets hazardouz
I said: "Mira, yo se que te gusto
Asi te sugero pon tu cuerpo en buen uso
Yo se que nadie baila mejor, te lo juro"
So I dropped it, and everybody yelled "Tubo!"
Mira mijo, mira lo que digo
I already told you I can drop it hasta el piso
This Latina señorita hit the scene up
Make it heat up whenever she be repping with estilo

[Hook]
He like it when I'm speaking Spanish, so he's after me
Amigas got the whole club, no one's hot as me
From the shoes to the purse, I'm so fine it hurts
And I know what I'm worth, no apologies
He said "Look at mami go" (when I walk in the door)
He said "Look at mami go" (when I step on the floor)
He said "Look at mami go" (when I put it on a mic what i meant he started hyperventilating when I got low)

[Verse 2]
Yo se que se emociono cuando entre yo al antro
Quiere conocerme y conversarr por buen rato
Quiere platicar, pero yo quiero bailar
Y si me quieren criticar, ay por favor, ni al caso
Yo soy la mera mera, la mejor de las raperas
Que se oponga la que quiera, yo líricamente mato
Pues a mi me vale, con que el DJ diga dale
Porque todo el mundo sabe, soy la reina del rap, yo
I know he like it when I roll my r's
He said he ain't never kicked it with a real star
Said i go hard, can i meet him at the bar
Cause he wanna take a little trip in his car
I said "Slow-down-boy, you need to stop but please.."
Cause I ain't even known him for 10 minutes and he already jacking me

[Post Verse]
When I step in the club, all the dudes turn they heads
And their girls wanna slap they face
Cause shoot i look good, no matter where i go
See, I ain't only pretty on MySpace

[Verse 3]
He want it cause I spit hot and heavy
I got you ready to quit
I drop it steady the top with plenty of chicks
They not that many who got the credit to spit
I rock, they're ready and talk, too many will flip
I know you know the flow will go to the peak
I throw them bows, bulldoze the hoes till they weak
I show to most the flow is pro when I speak
I grow some more get pros to work with when I speak
Now he want it cause he told me so
He said he never been with a Latin chick that flow before
So he said "what'd it do?", I showed him what's the biz
He wanted to give me the ring and want me to have his kids
I said "Slow down boy, you need to stop but please.."
Cause I ain't even known him for 10 minutes and he already jacking me
