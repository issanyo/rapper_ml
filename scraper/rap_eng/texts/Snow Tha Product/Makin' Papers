[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
In a whip that you’ve never seen before
Never blipped on your radar screen before
You’re doing what I was doing when I did it a couple magazines ago
That means if you LeBron, I was doing that Kareems ago
Abdul-Jabbar, the coolest are light years ahead and 15 below
How high I am and cold I is is the words that I just spoke, I did
I hope I did, cause sometimes I forget how much of a GOAT I is
Not a measuring of how dope I did – not an athlete, but the black sheep
I just rap shit – I focus so hard last time I blinked I broke my lids
That was kind of weak (that was kind of weak)
But what you expect when I get no sleep?
I’m my own worst critic, most times we split it
But we see eye-to-eye on how well we speak
Perfect verses
Better yet, letters get together, graduations and auctions
Bad at lying, but I speak that well
Also awesome and talkin’ to dolphins…

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash…
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash…
Why im grizzly on my grizzly making All my haters mad(stash)…

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Look, I’m steppin’ out of that all-black whip lookin’ like death and shit
I’ll spring forward, hoes fall back, I’ll turn ‘em down like a pessimist
And I’m at their head like a ball cap, at their neck like a necklace is
So it’s best to quit, ’cause my record spin, and keep gettin’ replayed like the record skipped
Killin’ game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won’t toe-tag ‘em, I’ve got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Snow White, what more to like? Y’all luck ran out, don’t roll the dice
Snow Tha Product’ll make you aligned
‘Cause you messin’ with me you was born to die
Killin’ game and whores alike, swagged out in my Jordan Flights
Hoes act like I won’t toe-tag ‘em, I’ve got hoes gassed like a motorbike
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike…
Got hoes gassed like a motorbike

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash…
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash…
Why im grizzly on my grizzly making All my haters mad(stash)…

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I wanna celebrate this, ’cause some of y'all ain’t gon’ never make it
I appreciate it, thanks… but I think she hates it
I don’t wanna hit it, girl – in the hotel room lickin’ pearl
I say “fuck the world” – make me mad, I’ll fuck your girl
No disrespect, you think I just wanna hit that shit?
I’m makin’ history – the truth: you can’t take it, bitch
I’m playin’ on the station, like your ass, I’m in rotation
Winnin’, but there’s no sensation – shoot it on her face then
What’d I win, what it do? I’ll get it later, mail it to me
I’m gettin’ higher – if it’s money, send a wire
I do this daily, she know she gots to pay me
I never lose in the end, don’t give a fuck when I win, bitch!

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
So just find somebody pretty to accept on my behalf
Sorry I couldn’t be there, but I’m back up in the lab
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash…
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, makin’ papers, makin’ papers and a stash
Makin’ papers, making paper front pages and the stash
Well I feel I keep it way too real, even when I pretend, when!
