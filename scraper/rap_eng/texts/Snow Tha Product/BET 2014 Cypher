[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
R.I.P. to Mike Brown
Never met Affleck, but I do it for the town
In the Chi where they find bodies in the lost and found
I've been blowing up in London, still smelling like a pound
While Ferguson was looting in the street
Obama was on the treadmill moving in repeat
I'm 21, I ain't had a cosign yet
Like Lamar Odom, they already know I had crack
Shout to Khloe, not Axel Foley
Call the police, your the lames on TV with braids like Lil' Romeo
No limit when I go in, it's a war zone
My troops home, they *brrt* "where you at?" like a boost phone
Y'all mobile, I'm global, we been different
Had a number #1 in the UK, that's a big difference
Not to mention, as a minor I was major
I ain't never get a job, I got my own business
SAVEMONEY

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Good credit, need no cosign
Snow Tha Product got the balls to come in the game
And I won't get no push from no guy
When I need the dough, split no pies
I'm not a cookie cutter bitch, but no shade
But if Snow spit it, Snow write
Oh, by the way you rappers namedrop El Chapo
Migos, Narkos, coppos, cop o's from papos
[?] Griselda Blanco
But I'm not gonna get my shot though?
Cuando a la culture para latina, tu you cacho
Pero mina que esta I'm raised on Pun and the best of 'em
You know I don't like Visas, give an Amex to a Mexican
And ooh, I'm 'bout to represent, ask BET
It's STP, hit your SAP button ASAP
Si porque mira nomas, mira que litica la chica [?}
Corazon de oro, pero con plata [?]
Si pero aqui no mas la que mata, bars, Sabado Gigante
Cause I'll be damned, if the only Latin rep is Joseline Hernandez

[Verse 3: Los]
Yo, I keep these rappers running like roaches when Raid come in
Los is the dopest, please don't provoke him to spray something
I hopped up out the bed as fresh as a Glade plugin
Cause I charged a high fee like the dance in the Bay, cousin
Just exit
Trying to describe me in one word is like if you spell dog, but you dyslexic
They should've kept my cage locked
Where I'm from if he say he tryna shoot that fade he get his fade shot
Hey, Pac, remember shit was poppin'?
You on my list, it was a wrap, I was Christmas shoppin'
I kept a full body cast for a bitch to hop in
Then I full bodied Cass while Swizz was watching
I'm way better whether you may agree
Mayweather pedigree, you make cheddar bet it on me
I get the best of the best dealt with
So when my magazine hit I ain't talking XXL shit
So the whip matte black, the top bent back
Got a chick misguided like a [?] flip
"Hello?" Man, hold that phone
My little homie raw, man, he got both Techs on
He told me to tell you it's a no flex zone
So you ain't making no chuck, nor is he getting his Bo Flex on
He unload that chrome, and send them if you talkie
I give him detail, and he'll pin it on a donkey
King

[Verse 4: Treach]
I put the word out like word out, word is bond, word up
Word is bird, wordie words that I heard
I got a herd of verbs that'll slap is for after yours
Anything after the fact is an act of war
Bad man and a wicked shotta
Wet you up like an otter, operate like Shabba
Hundred thousands way to hump, choose a telly
I'm rude and black like Ox from Belly
Got shellys to shock your shooters
Bet a bottom dollar I can make thunder clap and make a rottweiler holla
Yeah, rob the rich and eat with the hood, bang
Cause Jersey's back, back top of the food chain
KG was on the scenery
He said "eat the cypher, turn the BET to an eatery"
And here's a true statement
Half of the hip in hip hop needs a hip replacement

[Verse 5: David Banner]
My dream is to be a part of team Elohim
To transcend ten of walks of human beings
Meditate and convo with the all eye seeing
To maybe just hear
Quiet my soul so he shares or It can lighten my load
My soul [?] commode
Defecate [?]
I'm susceptible to the pressure but then I think about Shakir Stewart
I need help from the almighty
To ask why don't we discuss the trials of Chris Lightly
From Ku Klux the Klan who tied Emmett Till to a fan
The same that shot Tray, Zimmerman's hand
They got my stomach to a knot
I'm bent over prayin' to God like it's a lot, it's a lot
Ankles tied to some chain
I wanna say yes, but it's no like Tulane
I mean N.O
Not too many blacks make it to the show; Jay Leno
Went broke in a Bentley, now I'm rich whipping a pinto
I'm stunting like deep dish rims on Hertz rentals
When I was broke I was proud to sell dope to ya old folks house
Nigga, I meant it how it sounds
Where were the white rappers when they mowed Mike Brown down?
Nowhere to be found
