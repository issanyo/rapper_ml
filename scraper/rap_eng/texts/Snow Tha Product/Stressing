Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Verse 1: Castro Escobar]
I know you seen that text that I sent ya
I know that you still won't call me
I been blowing up all my exes
Feeling that you really don't want me
I could be the one if you let me
But you really ain't talking
All these other hoes be guessing
Now they on your IG stalking
Tryna hate on you, tryna be like you
Tryna do me, please me, act like you
'Cause they never had nobody that was just so true
Errybody that I fuck with just can't be my boo
Who bought that chain, bought that ring
Fixed you, got you, healed that pain
Everything I did, you my love, my main
I just can't explain

[Chorus: Castro Escobar & Snow Tha Product]
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
I gave you everything and took it back
Except my fucking heart, your flight got booked with that
I wish the way we ended, it just wasn't that
But I'ma take the L and I ain't looking back
'Cause I don't fuck with that
I gave you all of the best
Stunted on your ex
Never got the credit for letting you keep check
Like I wasn't all of that
Like I ain't have no other options, you ain't thought of that
Now let me call 'em back
I'm finna club, yeah
Turning up, yeah
'Cause I ain't learned my lesson, I'ma fuck it up, yeah
'Cause you a dub, yeah
[?] for what, yeah
And I'ma go out, I'ma run the numbers up, yeah
Now I'ma call up all my bitches, eh
Anyone that listen, eh
I'm about to sub you in the captions of my pictures, eh
Tryna keep it pimping, eh
Fuck a bitches feelings eh
I ain't learned my lesson, I'm still making bad decisions, eh

[Chorus: Castro Escobar & Snow Tha Product]
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson

[Verse 3: Jandro]
Baby, I know I'm so hard-headed and unpredictable
But one thing for certain, I'm stressing, texting and missing you
And it seems like the only thing you're missing is cause
It's pissing me off, started feeling like the distance is long
But there isn't shit I can do 'cause I reached all my strikes, right?
So now it is time, I can tell you to fuck who you like, sike
Straight shot to the chest
Even though I'm lying, you know I [?]
And I suggest, probably cut off all the friends
In my DM's, with heart eyes and pictures of them
Eh, straight doing the dirty, even though I'm flirty
You know I'm doing things that could hurt you, and I
I, I don't wanna be like that
I promise to love you lil mama, baby hit me back you know

[Chorus: Castro Escobar & Snow Tha Product]
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson
My girl broke up with me, and I'm stressing
And now I'm tryna find a better one
But I ain't even sure I learned my lesson
I ain't even learn my lesson
