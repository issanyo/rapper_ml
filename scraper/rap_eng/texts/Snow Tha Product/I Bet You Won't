[Intro]
Umm, I know you're not acting tough in the club right now
I know you are not acting tough in the club right now!
Look!

[Hook]
Haters all talking
Mugging when I walk in
Whispering and shit but running up is still an option
But I bet you won't (x8)
Bitches steady yapping
I'm yelling "What's happenin'?"
Saying they gon' get me cause I'm flagrant and I'm stacking
But I bet you won't (x6)

[Verse 1]
One look and I bet'chu don't like this chick
Bet you wanna stand up but you sit
Bet you say you balling but you can't pay rent
Bet you wanna come around and talk that shit
But I bet you won't, bet you don't
Acting fake come on bitch you grown
Even your man's a bitch and he wrong man cause I'm that chick he want
Bet I run up on a motherfucker like uh!
Little Mexican chick and I'm tough
Driving jamming knuck if you buck

Fuck writing a verse bitch I'll stick you with a pin
