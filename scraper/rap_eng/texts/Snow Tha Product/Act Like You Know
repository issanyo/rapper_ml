[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Ooo, you think that everything's a game but
Ooo, we like to drive in different lanes huh
Ooo, we tryna go different directions
Ride solo, catch you at an intersection look

[Pre-Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
'Cause I'm gettin' sick of the games

I'll hit you with the swerve again

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
Ay, you catch me on the turnin' lane
Ay, you better act like you know
Yeah, I think this ride just isn't workin' babe

I want you to want me so baby let's face it
No need for all this arguin' and actin' all crazy
Say you love me when you drunk
But when your sober you hate me
Doin' everything we shouldn't but that just doesn't phase me, yeah
I just hope that we don't lose control
And I hope that we can cruise control
And I know you worried 'bout all this traffic
Drivin' through with models but you'll still be a classic, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
'Cause I'm gettin' sick of the games

Fuck you
