I swear to god that it's not jealousy but I'm eyeing em
Like I see what they started with, I see what I am in
It's like my mama tried to do me good by putting me in better schools
Than what we could afford but then forgot the car I'm ridin' in
Forgot the rags that I am in
Forgot the money I don't get
Forgot the kids here are fucked up and I'm still tryin in
Forgot that I'm on free lunch and all these kids got money
Only broke ass kids be lining up, up in the line I'm in
Fuck it, I ain't buying it, I'ma sit here quietly
Fuckin' stomach hurted didn't eat but fuck it I am in
The cool kids table cuz of how I act
But I don't want them knowin' that I am broke as fuck
Cuz then the jokes start flyin' in
It's too close to home to be funny, huh
Suburbs really sucks with no money, huh
It's like they got a hungry kid surrounded by a bunch of meal tickets
I'm supposed to just ignore that I'm the bummy one
I wish I would've stayed up in the hood with my pops and shit
Cause what's the point to higher class unless I fit in
Cause I've been ditchin' school just to be alone, goddam
All that feels a lack of oxygen
Anxiety
