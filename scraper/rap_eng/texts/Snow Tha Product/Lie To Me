[Chorus: Jandro & Snow Tha Product]
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you try
I just need honesty
Was by your side, let you confide in me
Now I'm like honestly, I just need honesty
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
You knew what I was on
You knew it all along
You know they told me facts
You know you did me wrong
You know when I was gone
I ain’t do shit but make that dough
I just make plays on my phone
You play games, I played along
But bitch you lied, ooh bitch you lied to me
Got goddamn pride, ain't no apology
You goddamn right, you know you 'bout to leave
Fuck what you hide, well have your privacy
’Cause I mean you been on your phone too much
And somehow ain't no convos up
Truth is hard to swallow, so is pride
So fucking swallow up
You lie, I know what, you want, buckle up
'Cause this ride gon' fuck you up
Oh you just mad you got caught up

[Chorus: Jandro & Snow Tha Product]
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you try
I just need honesty
Was by your side, let you confide in me
Now I'm like honestly, I just need honesty
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you

[Verse 2: Jandro]
Look, said you was chilling with homegirls, right?
Gia, Leah, and Vanessa
See I called 'em all, they were all at home
So I'ma need a confession
And now you out here with a stupid face
'Cause you was tryna finesse a finesser
I promise lil mama I’m payin’ attention
You should probably sit 'cause the stories get better, okay
The other night when I was sleeping
I heard you get out the bed
I heard you go down the stairs
I heard you get on the phone
Heard every word that you said
Ay, but I ain’t mad though
Pack your bags hoe
You a bad thot, but a mad hoe
And you big mad, 'cause you mad broke
Bitch you mad dumb, I got bad hoes
Thought you seen that ma?
I need my keys back
Go hit your boo up and see where he at ma
And those my diamonds that's on your earrings
So I'ma need that ma
If thats all your things, then be on your way
And you can leave now ma

[Chorus: Jandro & Snow Tha Product]
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you try
I just need honesty
Was by your side, let you confide in me
Now I’m like honestly, I just need honesty
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you lie to me
Ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you, ooh bitch you
