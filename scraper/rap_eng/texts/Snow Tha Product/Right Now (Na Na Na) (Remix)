[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
It's been a good minute since he's seen me last
Since the last time we got into it bad
He told  me he was leaving and that I would never see him
And I got to admit it, hell it made me sad
I cried and I tried to call him but I got no reply
So now he's back and wants to talk to me and I think I know why
Cause he sees me looking good in the VIP
And I ain't let myself go but still byt
So he got me like a bst and I see that he wanna get at me
I know he want to get right back to where he left
But I also know that I ain't moved on and I don't really wanna have no regrets
Cause if I let him get to me and if I fall for it again
I'm gonna hear all the 'I told you so's' from all of my friends
It's gonna be like if I forgot how depressed I was when he left
But right now I can't even front i feel like he did and said
