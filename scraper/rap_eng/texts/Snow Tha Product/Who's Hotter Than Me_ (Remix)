[Verse 1]
Now who the fuck is hotter than me?
I'm Snow White Tha P-R-O-D-U-C make sure you cross that T
Not even allowed to see me when it comes to that heat
Better watch his ass when he wants to compete
With a little chick like she, I'm a beast
I am something else, nothing like me has come before
I melt destructions, why the fuck would i knock at the door?
Im coming through, burning bridges if you bitch-made
Hot chick, business shark, bars shot like shit blaze
I spit maize, burn your fucking bitch face
Ask me again bitch that's a mistake
Me grow, you tour like 11th grade
I'm one hell of a drug like -
