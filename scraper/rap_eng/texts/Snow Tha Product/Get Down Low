[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
'Sup bitch, 'sup hoe
Good game, cut throat
Shawty say that she love thugs oh
She better say no names if she got cuffs on
Lately I just do it for the fuck of it
Eyeliner so sharp that it'll cut a bitch
If it's Henny then of course I'll take a cup of it
Good luck getting me to give a fuck again
In, out and in out of state
I've been eatin' good, never been out of shape
But I've been out and sent out some bitches with weight
Better get out the pen now and print outs the pay
I be in out and in out and in out of planes
I don't trip out but trip out to get out of lane
Bitches hating on me, better sit down and wait
Better get out cause this round gon' hit y'all and spray
Bitch get back before I blocka
You a bad bitch, I'm a bad motherfucker
Tell the valet bring the keys, bring the truck up
When you talk to to me you better stand up and look up
Hoe get back cause I'm back now
Top producers bringing A1 tracks out
We about to make these motherfuckers black out
Mamacita make and bake and makin' cash now
Get down low

Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor

Get down, get down low
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low, all the way to the floor
Get down low
Get down, get down low

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Snow-ee-yo I spit that hot fire
If you ain't heard you got a cross wire
You ain't been on no shit that's not hard
You ain't gettin' no cake sweetheart, that's pop tart
You don't got it down like moi
When I spit bars, leave 'em all in awe
Five foot tall but the aura large
And in charge, I'm a boss, leave your broad like, "God!‚Äù
Little mamacita got a lot of grip
They be noticing I be talking 'bout economy
Have you seen the Mexicana with the dollars in
And I get the cheese, I ain't lactose intolerant
So follow me when I get out bags and get out masks and, uh
Get out gats and get that cash and run
Hit that gas and hit that armored truck
Just sit back and flip that in a month like whoo!
Ain't I tell y'all I'm here
Ain't I tell y'all I'm runnin' up and bustin' on 'em
Ain't I say this my year
Ain't I tell y'all I'm coming up and stuntin' on 'em
Cause I've been on the phone closing deals
I've been talking 'bout how we gon' flip and we gon' spend it
I don't care if I'ma go legit or if I'ma come in a ski mask, bitch I'ma get it
Look, get down, get down low
