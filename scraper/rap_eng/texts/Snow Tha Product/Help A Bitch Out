[Intro: O.T. Genasis]
Yung Lan on da Track
Whatchu want?
Get it then

[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out
How much your car, lil' bitch? (Uh huh)
How much your rent, lil' bitch?
How much your bag, lil' bitch?
I'm 'bout to spend this shit
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
I don't need no help, I don't need a man
I need me a bad one on a Perc' or Xan
A lap to dance, some racks, and a bag of bands
And goddamn Mexican, don't give a workin' hand
Pretty bitches in the clique, like ooh
Fuck around, get up in the middle, like ooh
Do you need help? Do your baby need food?
I'm a pretty girl, need a pretty girl like you
I got Hennessy in my cup, ain't no jealousy, bitch, I'm up
That boy 'bout to catch some feelings
She's about to catch some one's
Baby girl faded and I'm really out of it (out of it)
Princess cuts, I'm Disney channellin'
I got a bag, baby what's happenin'?
Know when you cash women's empowerment
I be stuntin' on these boys, mamacita bring the noise
You just keep that ass in motion, I'ma keep that ass employed
She told me my highlight poppin', asked me if my hair was real
So I asked about her booty, she said, "Baby how's it feel?"

[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out
How much your car, lil' bitch? (Uh huh)
How much your rent, lil' bitch?
How much your bag, lil' bitch?
I'm 'bout to spend this shit
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out

[Verse 2: O.T. Genasis & Snow Tha Product]
Stand up you know I do it
Street money you know what I'm doin'
Ramp it up, I be gettin' to it (run it up)
Jewelry on you know I be coolin' (sauce, sauce, sauce)
Goin' thru these racks I got packs
Shoppin' spree, Neiman's, Barney's, Sak's
Snowie get the baddies, that's a fact
Bitch is crazy but the booty fat
Man, I got these fake ass ballers, lame as fuck
They fake, just skunkies, boys ain't throwin' out
I got her twerkin', droppin', doin' tricks, she too much for a dollar
Fuck you want, fuck up-front, I'm about make 'em sick
Man I got the VIP, I throw up a grip and a bitch gon' fuck it up again

[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out
How much your car, lil' bitch? (Uh huh)
How much your rent, lil' bitch?
How much your bag, lil' bitch?
I'm 'bout to spend this shit
I think I'ma help a bitch out
I think I'ma help a bitch out
