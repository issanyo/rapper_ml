[Verse 1: Castro Escobar]
Uh, what do you do when your parents is doing bad
And this dream that you keep on chasin' ain't bringing in any cash
I'm fuckin' everything up but I'm doing all that I can
Cause I ain't workin' enough
But enough was never the plan
See, we been working all night, me and EC
Just tryna get us a slice like we at CiCi’s
It seems we getting nothing done when we sleep
I just wish everybody could see what we see
Bitch
I'm influenced by everything that I been around
I bring the hustle
Tryna let us fuck with the windows down
In a small town 4K the population
My mind is racing', I keep on pacin' ain't no vacation
Me and the crew riding reckless in a golden Nissan
No license
Yeah mutha fuck the police now
On top of that we got Goose, man, sittin up in the trunk
We knowin' the consequences but still not givin' a fuck
Drinking my thoughts away
Tomorrow's a brighter day
Hip hop was tryna leave until I convinced her to stay
Voices in my head but I still don’t know what they saying
Demons outside my window tryna prevent me from praying
Yeah, yeah
Voices in my head but I still don’t know what they saying
Yeah, yeah
Demons outside my window tryna prevent me from prayin' one time

[Chorus]
They on they way
Shit gon' be straight
Lord give me faith
I been working
Oh, yeah, I been working, oh yeah
They on they way
Shit gon' be straight
Lord give me faith
I been working
Oh, yeah, I been working, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Look
Look I been out here
Working like I ain't tired
I’m picking up every piece
And I'm putting out every fire
I’m solving everyone’s problem
Til every issue is ironed
I've done created a matriarch
Now it’s down to the wire
It's time to show me they got me cause I been losing my strength
Swear to God that I’m happy with every decision made
But if I could talk bout anything
Half the people I paid
Half the people I put on just wanted a little fame
When it was bout they problems
I helped them in every way
Soon as I lost my footing
I seen the energy change
All of a sudden I am the competition
And wait
All of them started fuckin' with people they used to hate
Now every piece of advice that I gave 'em is in my way
Everything that I taught 'em is how they tryna play
And I’m not the type to be salty
But baby, there’s just one thing
That you tryna make better moves
But bitch I created the game
And I got me a fuckin' name that you never thought I would have
Smiling in my face
But you know I'ma make em mad
When I pull out the fuckin' moves that I plan
As soon as they shifted
Cause there is one thing about bitches like me that been in the trenches
I lost it all in a second and made it back inconsistently
Simply kicked it into higher gear when they was dissing me
Physically, visibly, you could tell a new me has risen
And all of you fucking bitches that thought that you could fucking get to me
You're about to eat your words like a dinner yeah
Let your ego get you all up in your feelings yeah
I just let 'em all play themselves out
Y'all forgot that you was fuckin' with a winner yeah
Beginners yeah
Everybody think they got me figured yeah
But please believe I didn’t get this far by being bitter yeah
I got tired, vibed higher, went higher
Better ones, these young'ns got a point to prove
Better run

[Chorus]
They on they way
Shit gon' be straight
Lord give me faith
I been working
Oh, yeah, I been working, oh yeah
They on they way
Shit gon' be straight
Lord give me faith
I been working
Oh, yeah, I been working, oh yeah
