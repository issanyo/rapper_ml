Lemme start by saying, 'Fuck your co-sign'
Come against me, get clothes-lined
I'm a lil' chick with a flow tight
I gotta little bit more than a dope line
I gotta big mouth and I don't mind
Coming up in the game, showing haters no shine
No love, no hugs, no blood, no buzz
Oh, ho, ain't you know it's Snow time?
They got no inner style on them
Higher than a G-5 pilot on them
My bad, my swag's so violent on them
That fly persona out of California
I'm a bad lil' chick and I'm mashing on them
High class but I could get [?] on them
Killing game like I got a casket on them
High class but I will get ratchet on them
Latin chick that go beast mode, and these streets know
These bitches hate, but they don't say shit when they see Snow
If it's beef, ho, then go get a plate
Everywhere now, in with my syndicates
It's a movie, bitch, get a date
I'm a room service, I'm throwing out the garbage
That's what you call a minute made
And I ain't changed shit I'm the same old chick
I ain't even got to change my phone
I'm just trying to get rich to afford payments
Fuck weed, legalize my mom
I'm just running the game with a little bit of vague
And I'm proud to call Texas home
But don't forget that Snow's the shit
I'm Mexican, I'll go platinum in LA alone
