[Intro: DRAM & Snow Tha Product]
Hmm myself
Yeah
Hmm myself

[Chorus: DRAM & Snow Tha Product]
Yeah, yeah
Hmm I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Fuck Backwoods, I roll that dope all by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my
Oou wee, I swear to God I love myself (yeah)
I came up got that money by myself (damn)
Ridin' dolo, drive the foreign by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Y'all jumped off of the porch late
I was already in a rental
Early bird get the worm and it won't wait (yeah, yeah)
Haters all gettin' sentimental
'Member I was workin' while you hoes stayed home
I was out grindin' while you settled
Still helped you out and I gave y'all loans
Not my fault what you spent on
Now I gotta (hmm), stay away, away, you haters I came up on my own
They all say I've changed and I ain't changed my line or changed my phone
I've been waitin' for the day I finally came up in so long
Ain't nobody take my credit, got no co-sign and no loan

[Chorus: DRAM & Snow Tha Product]
Yeah, yeah
Hmm I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Fuck that Backwoods, I roll that dope all by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my
Oou wee, I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Ridin' dolo, drive the foreign by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my

[Verse 2: DRAM]
Snow had to hustle, she had to get it herself (herself)
I was off a same wave so I know how she felt (know how she felt)
When that check is on the line, you know that check is gon' help
And there's no one I want to get that check instead of myself (let's get it, yeah)
Queue that cash machine, send those racks to me (to me)
Bitch this swag ain't free (ain't free), my bitch bag ain't cheap (na, na)
I treat Ksubis like they Levi's, those my average jeans (yeah)
Gettin' guala casually (yeah), bring me all my [?] (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: DRAM & Snow Tha Product]
Yeah, yeah
Hmm I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Fuck Backwoods, I roll that dope all by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my
Oou wee, I swear to God I love myself (yeah)
I came up got that money by myself (damn)
Ridin' dolo, drive the foreign by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my

[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]
By myself
For them days that I stayed up late all by myself
Ain't no help
Made that cake and I whip that, bake that by myself
Went through hell
So I prayed up, waited look how God done help
Trials I faced but I got faith and I done made it out
And yes it's by myself
For them days that I stayed up late all by myself
Ain't no help
Made that cake and I whip that, bake that by myself
Went through hell
So I prayed up, waited look how God done help
Trials I faced but I got my credit with no co-sign and no loan

[Chorus: DRAM & Snow Tha Product]
Yeah, yeah
Hmm I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Fuck Backwoods, I roll that dope all by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my
Oou wee I swear to God I love myself
I came up got that money by myself
Ridin' dolo, drive the foreign by myself
I swear to God I love my, love my, love my
