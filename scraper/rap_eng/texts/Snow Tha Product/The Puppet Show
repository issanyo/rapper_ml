And all I wanna hear from you it is get in lava
Yeah Yeah I'm coming mama

Finding someone who can tell me now

We gotta go for the love, I gotta fight for the love
And everybody is in the corner, hiding underground
We gotta go for the love, I gotta fight for the love
And everybody is in the corner, wait I'm coming for you

And All I want it's you

And everybody is in the corner, hiding underground
We gotta go for the love, I gotta fight for the love
And everybody is in the corner, wait I'm coming for you
