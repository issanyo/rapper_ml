[Hook]
I got some cute chicks, few clips
Bitches with some pistols
Got that pretty face, but will catch a case
Fuck with them and lord be with you
Lord be with you, lord be with you
Yeah lord be with you
I got some cute chicks, few clips
Bitches with some pistols
Got that pretty face, but will catch a case
Fuck with them and lord be with you
Lord be with you, lord be with you
Yeah lord be with you

[Verse 1]
I think that everybody puttin' they bid in
But this chick here ain’t auctioning
Snow Tha Product done been uncut
But I whip back into shape and I will rock again
Cuz these hoes stay salty like condiments
But I be killin' game and I’ll chalk a bit
Cuz these square ass bitches already in the right shape
For me they no more than a box of mints
I flip a shirt like I flip the work
I flip a ditch like I flip the bitch
And I’m makin' money legitimate
But my side hustle finna make me rich
My money movin' and circlin'
I work the scale like I work the weight
I'm workin' early and I'm workin' late
And I'll post the bitch and she will work the day

[Pre-Hook]
What you tellin' me, you ain’t hearin' me?
What you think I'm light skin, so this weird to me?
You think I’m finna have a fella take care of me?
Bitch at 17 I was facing hella felonies
The cutest stick up kid you ever met
Then I had a couple chicks out selling sex
Hoes harass, go get gas, then I throw her ass out the house
Cause I’m back on deck yes!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look, what you know about chicks
Puttin' chicks on the blade
Getting dough after shows everyday
Sellin' coke on the coast
And you know we gonna go and get them
Bitches paid
I had a cousin named Diana, she know that Arm & Hammer
She smoke weed but never bama
And she so Hannah Montana
Yeah that white girl with that mass appeal
I had a ho in 09 and her ass was real
Craig’s list, yeah bitch, yeah we had a deal
She crazy, paid me to post ads and chill
I got pimpin' in my bones, bitches run the show
I got tipped from all these hoes
And they be postin' getting dough

[Pre-Hook]
What you tellin' me, you ain’t hearin' me?
What you think I'm light skin so this weird to me?
You think I’m finna have a fella take care of me?
Bitch at 17 I was facing hela felonies
I got Mexicans with shipments
We out here and we shippin'
Got Latin folks with no passports
And getting money and they spending

[Hook]
