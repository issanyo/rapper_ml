Bitch with a bag
Like me that move through the city
Can't keep it snowing

A cold heart to cool off
The bottles of Henny
Can't stand a dude that can't stunt again
Fuck with the boss is a covenant
Get you life fucked up
If you don't covet it
My mind secure the bag
And then i funnel it

Since whenever so it's
Just one more night
On the road

[Chorus: AJ Hernz]
Sauce drippin off you like a waterfall
How you come from nothing and got it all
Sauce drippin off you like a waterfall
How-how you come from nothing
And got it all
Your look can make 'em slip and slide
How-how you come from nothing
And got it all
Ooh you want it all tonight, oh oh
