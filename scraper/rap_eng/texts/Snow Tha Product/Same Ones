[Intro]
Look, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Man I used to pray for this
Got bullshitted and played for this
Never thirsty for famous shit
But I wanna buy mami a crazy crib
Finally get paid for shit
I been doing "for free" for long
I would get up before dawn
Man I had like 3, 4 jobs
And it showed me I, gonna need time
Gonna work hard, but I'll be fine
Gonna go far, never rewind
Snow gonna get payed for these lines
Bitch I'm dope, and I'm gonna let these haters know
Uh, look

[Bridge]
Yeahhhh, cause I done came up off rap
Straight rags to riches
85 Cadillac, man this shit switchin
But the only thing the same is how I feel
All these things done changed but we still real

[Hook x2]
I be with the same kids from when I started out
Yall ain't gotta ask already know what I'm about
Man I'm just out here with my team
I'm just out here with my team
Same ones that believe
Same ones that believe

[Verse 2]
Man I used to run around
With all the crew that I run with now
We went through broke days and got no pay
Tell Atlantic to budget out
A couple folks on my payroll
We been woke, yall just ain't know
It's been more than flow, it's been more than clothes
It's more than just Snow, this shit about hope
Cause you said that hard work pays
So we worked all night, all day
And you said all work, no play
And we listened, now the shit changed
Now they say the game about luck
Now they trynna tell me I'm stuck?
Now you trynna have me go back to the fans I earned tell them I fucked up? Fuck no
Before we get cut, we get cut throat
Cause I'm keepin up with these uploads
As long as we been us, people loved, us for us so we keeping it hondo
Cause I bought my dad's dream car and I'm lane switchin'
Same fam, same plan, same fans, makin it, look

[Hook x4]
I be with the same kids from when I started out
Yall ain't gotta ask already know what I'm about
Man I'm just out here with my team
I'm just out here with my team
Same ones that believe
Same ones that believe
