[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
You know how I get off the henny shit, posting all that petty shit
Subs and little party posts with liquor, get you jelly quick
I mean I get, thousands of views up on my videos
And I been scrolling for hours to check if you seen it though
I mean it though
Love to get under your skin but mostly on it
Can I make your ass love me again?
I think I got it, let’s be honest
You ain’t use to act like you do, nah
I ain’t tryna to ask about you, swear to god
And you can fuck whoever you want 'cause I got your heart
But just be careful who you vent to, cause uh, people talk
And you say you’ve been on your grind, and working out and shit
You text me I’ve been on your mind, yeah I been out of it

[Pre-Chorus: Snow Tha Product & LexTheGreat]
Cause 'I’ve been drinking a lot (ooo)
And I’ve been thinking about, you
And maybe if you got some time, here that when I come outside
And we can get together like the last time, baby
Cause I’ve been drinking a lot
And I’ve been thinking about you
And maybe if you got some time, here that when I come outside And we can get together like the last time baby

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
All I know is you been on my mind (You been on my mind)
I’ma come through like, what we gon' do, yeah
Baby come gimme me time, and I’ma pull up like
Yo, all I know is you been on my mind (You been on my mind)
I’ma come through like, what we gon' do, yeah

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
Uh, you been on my mind lately
Man you know I’m out here workin' this over time baby, yeah
You say you ain’t worried 'bout the things I do
I say the same thing but we know it isn’t true
I hit the studio at late night
Thinking about how we treat each other, it ain’t right
All them scenes that we caused during them date nights
But I don’t think that we care if we really ain’t fight
I love you for real
Even though I showed the opposite you stayed with me still
You gave me everything that I ain't never thought could be real
And made me feel every way I thought I never would feel, yeah

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
All I know is you been on my mind (You been on my mind)
I’ma come through like, what we gon' do, yeah
Baby come gimme me time, and I’ma pull up like
Yo, all I know is you been on my mind (You been on my mind)
I’ma come through like, what we gon' do, yeah
Baby come gimme time
