[Verse 1]
Look, I put it on mine
I own everything you see me in
I got twice your advance, guess that makes you intermediate
Bitches out here flexing, I guess they ain't eat they Wheaties yet
But bitch I'm so good, they tryna find out the ingredients
A little dash of ghetto with a couple cups of lean
Sweet like amaretto, gutter like a glass of Henn
Little Prada like the devil, but I swear you'll never see
Your bitch on a higher level, that's really kept it this G

[Bridge]
Everyday I hear shit about how I gotta change
How I gotta adapt to the game
Ay, I know I'm stubborn, stuck I'm my ways
I called shots and that is not gonna change cause

[Hook] (x4)
That's what got me this far
That's what got me this far
That's what got me this...

That's what got me this...

[Verse 2]
All by myself, just me and my ADD
Who'da known when I was 5 I'd get paid off my ABC's
But it's rap, I'm in a lane that ain't nobody pave for me
So this road been hella dirty, but Mexicans made to clean
So I've been in, making it hella sweet but I hear you talking shit
So what I bring to the table, I'mma eat and wash my dish
I'm humble and talk my shit cause nobody gave me a map
When I get to where I'm going, fuck you, I ain't going back
Cause every man in my career say my attitude is bad
Cause I'm skeptical, I question anything I fucking ask
So why would anyone get mad, if I was a man I'dd be a boss
Cause I wanna know whats out there, every win and every loss
Every expense and every cost and every pinch and every drop
Cause everything I've ever brought
I brought the team, I swear to god
If I was doing this for me, I'd ease up a bit
But I got many more to feed, this shit's for us, ya bitch

[Hook] (x4)
That's what got me this far
That's what got me this far
That's what got me this...

That's what got me this...
