[Intro]
You're recording?
Yo, look
Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?
Yo, look

[Verse 1]
Look
I just woke up like I beat the charge and cashed out back to back
Like Maury told Chris Brown, I got a baby and he the dad
Like my boyfriend cheated on me, but I ran off with his stash
Like I lost a couple pounds, but I got to keep my ass
I just woke up like Yoncé, attitude gigante
He said “No comprande”
Size elefante, this is on a mild day
Haters wake up
Better preach it like Aretha, pray before your makeup
I got these bitches kinda trippin', I'm alive and still kickin'
Yeah they stole my style, but I still made a couple million
Yeah they got me fucked up, it's cool bro I'm chillin'
I just let 'em copy homework, just did it a little different
I'm insistin', you can keep it
I'ma keep doing what I do though
I write bars, make lines, baby I move dope
And I do shows and side shows and I do go
And hatin' bitches talk they shit
But one thing is tell a bitch I

[Hook]
Tell a bitch
I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go
Tell a bitch
I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go
Tell a bitch, I go
Bitch go, bitch go, bitch go
Bitch go, bitch go, bitch go
Tell a, tell a bitch
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[Verse 2]
Look
Look I'ma need 100 bottles cause I got up out a deal
And give me fifty feet of space and little bitch back it up a little
And fuck a table, I need sections at the club to keep it real
And I could finally admit it, bitch I made a couple mill'
And bitch I need to call my jeweler, tell JP to get my grill
And bring the ice and chains to cool my temper, I'ma need to chill
I went through hell and back and finally, look I'ma pop a pill
I’m ‘bout to let ‘em know the truth (woo)
This just how I feel, I feel like
Baby, baby, baby (uhh)
Need a new Mercedes (uhh)
I'ma act a fooly (uhh)
Nobody can save me (uhh)
Fuck all of the waiting (uhh)
Fuck a bitch that’s hating (uhh)
Got my lawyers calling me cause boy my temper crazy
I’ve been all up in the bank and (yuh)
Money finally came in (yuh)
Love a bitch or hate a bitch (yuh)
But make sure that you pay me (yuh)
I just spent like eighty (yuh)
Another eighty waiting (yuh)
Bitches used to hate on me
But lately say I’m wavy (yuh)
Snowy, owy, owy (huh)
Rollin' like a stogie (huh)
Got me a new shorty (huh)
From New York like bogies (huh)
If you know, you know me (huh)
Pimpin’ macaroni (huh)
Must want me to cook a bitch the way she throwing sodium
40 tucked, told you bruh
Haters out here hoin' up
If you bang, you gang then
Let me know and throw it up
Twenty bitches rollin' up
Make the club announce for that ass
And if you ain't my bitch, booty better bounce

[Hook x2]
Tell a bitch
