[Verse 1]
God damn I’m a rock band member
And I’ve always been a G
Thought you lost that letter on me
Literally I’ve been getting it
Guap thats cheddar, get Up off that
You’ve better go out and do better
Get a job, get a bitch, get some positive shit
Get a mob into it, get some profit and flip
Everything you ever wanted it’s not impossible bitch
Get up off your lazy ass and just go get it

[Hook]
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it

Bet you, I’ma get it, I ain’t trippin’ ‘bout no hater bitches
My team and I win it I ain’t finna sit debate it with em
Bet you, I’ma get it, I ain’t trippin’ ‘bout no hater bitches
My team and I win it I ain’t finna sit debate it wit em

[Verse 2]
I’d be hitting the party with five chicks
And I’m probably leaving all these kids
Calling for my hips
Got a bunch of them behind me
And all up on my shit
I’d be getting it, I got it, I’m all about profit
I’d be yelled in the function I’m steady red cuppin'
I’m whooping their ass as I flip a cup
I’m young and I’m loving the life in the club
And I’m getting that bread, and I’ma get enough

[Hook]
You know I’d be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I’d be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I’d be getting it, getting it, getting it

Bet you, I’ma get it, I ain’t trippin’ ‘bout no hater bitches
My team and I win it I ain’t finna sit debate it with em
Bet you, I’ma get it, I ain’t trippin’ ‘bout no hater bitches
My team and I win it I ain’t finna sit debate it with em
With em, I ain’t finna sit debate it with em (wi-with em)
I ain’t finna sit debate it with em
Dumb dumb dumb bitches
Dumb dumb
I ain’t trippin', dumb dumb dumb bitches

[Hook]
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it
You know I be getting it, getting it, getting it
