[Intro]
Where the queens is at
Where the queens is at
Where the queens is at
Uhh

[Verse 1]
Better move, better make a better move
Better run quick, hide, 'cause see me I never lose
Better shoot, take a shot better shoot
I’ma get what's mine, get the product and the loot, better grind
Tell me where I've gotta go and get it, tell me what I gotta do
I gotta get the benefits and look around, tell me what I gotta go against
Tryna show me who can stop me, I’ma show you I'ma win

[Hook]
'Cause I am the queen, I am what they want
I have something that cannot be bought
I am the queen, yes I am a boss
I'm in command, I take no days off

[Verse 2]
Who? Who is gonna come against me, don't do it to yourself
Esto es para ti, act cool
Anything worth it ain't free
To be a boss, it's a cost and I payed that fee

[Hook]
Better run my check, better run that
I'ma sit back, setup for a comeback
Better run my check, better run that
I’ma sit back, setup for a comeback
’Cause I am the queen, I am what they want
I have something that cannot be bought
I am the queen, yes I am a boss
I'm in command, I take no days off

[Verse 3]
You don’t gotta watch that throne 'cause it's mine
Give that crown 'cause it been my time
There ain’t never be another quite like I
'Cause if crime pays, then I'm 'bout that life
Where? Tell me where the queens is at
Independent women that don't need a king for that
Get the money, get the power, make you feen for that
Make 'em bow down everywhere they see you at

[Bridge]
(Uhh) Where the queens is at
Where the-Where the queens is at
Where the queens is at
Where the-Where the queens is at
Make 'em bow down everywhere they see you at (uhh)
For the crown (for the crown), look around (look around)
Tell me what I gotta go against
Tryna show me you can stop me, I'ma show you I'ma win

[Hook]
Better run my check, better run that
I'ma sit back, setup for a comeback
Better run my check, better run that
I'ma sit back, setup for a comeback
Uhh, uhh
