Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Verse 1]
Today I decided to not give you bitches a second of time
For the rest of my life
I’ll be god damned if I put in the work and I don’t get the credit to fucking suffice
I’ve been too humble too much of my life
Cuttin' em off so I’m measuring twice
'Cause this time I mean it, I’m still fucking bleeding bitch
There was better ways to hand me the knife
Like poor little Snowy, .40 is on me
Half of these idiots dumb as a brick
Swear I won’t use it when y'all up on YouTube
I aim with the .45, fucking intense
Imagine if no stolen whip with the ten
Imagine if I finally wanted to quit
Imagine if this industry took the life out a bitch
And all I got is fucking revenge
Who would I ride on if I’m 'bout to call it?
I think my fans know a couple of names
I know some five figure checks that I’ve written
And can’t say a word cause a bitch NDA’d
Call all my lawyers cause I keep 'em payed
But they say some shit that my lawyers could save 'cause
If I do go out I’m going out strong
And I’ll leave y'all a note with key to the safe

[Verse 2]
Yeah, look
Today I just noticed that all of the friends that I lost
That was talking shit all on the net
All have apologized all of em know that I fucking invented 'em never forget
I never went out in public to vent
I know exactly what I represent
And any lil bitch that was that quick to switch up
All of you deserve what the fuck you gon' get
How does it feel when you look at your fans
And you know that you’ll lose em if I ever talk?
If I ever pull up receipts of some videos Shorty
I bet you, you piss in your draws
All you little bitch ass
Still ain’t ever shit ass, fickle ass, flip flop lying ass ho
You should thank God with like every breath
That I ain’t talk my shit 'cause I stuck to the code
But ain’t I hit you up directly told you that you best be treading real carefully bitch?
Bitch, bitch don’t you forget we still got a debt
See I’ma collect my shit
If you got a question I got an answer
Ain't I keep the same line?
All that boo-hoo shit on the net was a clout chase
Them lies are so tired

[Outro]
Yo I just noticed that everybody that don’t fuck with me
Fucks with each other
It’s like a fuckin' union of dumbass people
Ayy, but I’m coming back for my money though I’m not playin'
Bitch
