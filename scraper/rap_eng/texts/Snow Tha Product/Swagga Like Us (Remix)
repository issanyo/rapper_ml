[Hook: M.I.A.] (x7)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
You can't spell swag without starting with S-W for Snowhite
Swag in the flesh and I rock like [?]
I'm so surpassing these broke bitches and broke guys
Nothing on me can be found at a low price
No one in the world has swagger like Snowhite the mastermind
Cooler than a bag of ice and [?]
Schoolyard cool kid, black top, rock star
In third grade i was flashier than cop cars
See, no one on the corner was wearing what i bought
Im in next years Jas and im married to the mob
No one on the corner knows what all this costs
Im in oversears fashion, bitch is shopping at [?]
Bitch get to know me, im stepping up to the [?] which including the purse, its worth more than 4g's
You seen these before? you must be joking
This new shit is so dope, you can smoke me

[Hook: M.I.A.] (x7)
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
