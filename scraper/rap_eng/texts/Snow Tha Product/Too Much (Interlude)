It's too much to take
Too much to take
Sometimes it's too much to take
Had to say it three times, one for me, one for you, one for all these little lazy bitches tryna hate

I've been on my grind for too long, but I've been
Letting this shit fly for too long, the irony
The harder that I work the harder life is tryna check me
There's a reason more and more these fucking people hate sobriety
I do, I run from problems that I've got, inside of me
I open one door and two lock, it's tiring
I don't even have no one to call, I'm dialing
At this point a stranger probably help me more than friends that lie to me
It's like I've been working so hard it's like I hit a wall, entirely
Too proud to quit, and shit is getting hard
Society has placed me in a tank inside the ocean
I just get to see them free but I'm stuck in a bubble I'm fucking dying in
Anxiety
