[Verse 1]
Babe show me what you like
Ay I put money I can match it for ya
I'm in this bitch and I don't wife it
Looking like a brick and all them zippers on the jacket on ya
He got a thang for a latin chick
He wanna hear a little spanish
I told em it ain't shit to practice it
I'm bout to [?]
Walk up with the click
And I ain't lookin' like the side in this
I'm the opposite cause I'm the main event
Bossin' in it
As the time been tickin'
I been outchea playin' my position
I'm bout to get it our way
Now I'm bout to block the [?]

[Hook]
Some day, some day
Some time I'll find someone, someone
To tell me I'm somewhat, somewhat
Doing alright, doing alright
Somewhere, somewhere
I'ma find me that someone, someone
That somebody that one day, one day
Will be the love of my life, love of my life
But not tonight though

[Verse 2]
Hey I'm only here for a minute
Bet you want a girl that keep it hella independent
Know you gotta like a girl that this appealing
If you caught up in the moment
Then I'll get you in your feelings
Tell your boys that you gon' meet 'em later on
Both of us are drunk so taxi leave the meter on
First time you're out in Cali
Never tried no weed this strong
So you gon' have some stories to tell
When you take your ass back home
One time, one time
Snowy-owie showed you what it's like
Leave you sleepy like the codeine
Call the umpire
Get you out & get you rollin'
Get your shit, you gotta go
I got a flight up in the mornin'

[Hook]
Some day, some day
Sometime I'll find someone, someone
To tell me I'm somewhat, somewhat
Doing alright, doing alright
Somewhere, somewhere
I'ma find me that someone, someone
That somebody that one day, one day
Will be the love of my life, love of my life
But not tonight though

[Bridge]
He trying to catch me in my feelings
But he don't know that I'm the plug though
Shout out to my bitches
That can get it independent
And they lookin' for no love though
He trying to catch me in my feelings
But he don't know that I'm the plug though
He trying to stunt & get me drinks
I got the bottle from this section
And I pray this fuckin' club bang
