[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Yeah! Uhm
Look! Pockets looking cakey like these bummy bitches make up
It's room service bitch, the game requested that it get waked up!
See all I see is paper like my secretary's staplers
So if this was yo job, then I'm thinkin' your about to get a pay cut!
This my lane so fuck road rage, fuck yo anger!
I swear they wanna cuff this pretty young thing, like a bailiff!
Cuz I'm cute
And I be killing games since way back when it was Sega!
I be repping Texas but I'm so Cali like a Laker
Yeah, yeah I'm kind of cocky
When it come to what I'm made of
Cause we, we ain't the same
And they don't want you from the waist up!
You the cookie cutter type and they call me the baker!
And all I see is numbers, numbers, numbers like a pager
I kill em and collect em
Watch me murder glass cases
I swear you got to feel where the fuck I'm coming from like a taser
Cause if she fuck with me
Then not even the captain finna save her!
These bitches thinking they beefing
Fuck around and get fed, laid up!

[Hook]
I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches
Oh cookie cutter bitches!
And I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches!
Oh cookie cutter bitches!

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Look! You are just a small fry
But I'll turn you to mashed potato
I'm here to bring the flavor
Just like a turkey baster
I could be the finisher that will make ya meet your maker
See, if you still sleeping, I'mma wake and bake and shake ya
See, I be repping real women so bitches seeming faker
Now they be tripping on me, but like MGK say, "lace up!"
Cause my style is permanent and these bitches dry eraser
And all you April fools, I'll kill you off before um, May come!
Yeah, I know guerrilla warfare if you wanna ape up
All these chicks be thinking they beast well watch me tame em'
Greeting earthlings, "hi!" As-salam alaykum
Cause I'm out of this world, this illegal alien way up!
I'm ahead of my time but I like competing so I be waiting
Then I turn the lights on these roach bitches and I raid 'em
Bitches owe me royalties for jacking lyrics, so pay up!
Cause most of you bitches rappin' know nothing about me
But you wishing that I never came up!

[Hook]
I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches
Oh cookie cutter bitches!
And I be looking, looking, looking
I don't see no difference!
Cookie, cookie, cookie
All these cookie cutter bitches!
Fuck these bitches, fuck these bitches!
Oh cookie cutter bitches!

[Outro]
Look man I keep looking around
And all these bitches look the fuckin' same, and the same
Ain't there nothing different on the menu
