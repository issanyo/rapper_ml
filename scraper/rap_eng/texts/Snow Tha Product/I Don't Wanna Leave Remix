[Chorus: Tdot illdude]
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
(Shit I'm on one percent)
I, done way too much for too many
I rap too much, rep too hard, confuse plenty
How the fuck a bitch this pretty rap that fire
I'm a diamond in the rough and bitches can't top fire
I've been all that, thinking I'm a have to quit playing
I been staying in my lane and I ain't never switched any
But to me, this game ain't pay me right
Ooh I was gonna kill them, Lord, save me I
Been the realest bitch coming in the game yeah
You know Mexicanos keep it G
If you ain't with it get the fuck up out the way yeah
I still got the drive, baby pick a seat
'Cause I been on my own, and bitch at this moment
This is rap calisthenics, I am just at home, but in my zone
So anybody wondering when the music out
I have two-year-old records barely coming out
I wonder how my life would've gone different
If the things I played ain't playing out
And if I switched the style up like 50 said
And wilded out and piled it up?
Fuck a hater, word of mouth ain’t never done shit for me
But spread the word that I’m the fucking hardest ever
Doesn’t really matter anymore
Cause I been out rapping all these dudes too
I’m shaking every hand while I’m on tour…free
And never got the props that all these dudes do
Cause all my Product Pushas told me that I got they blessings
Told me swang these lanes bitch and get them checks
Gon’ finally get what you deserve
You underrated, overstressed, you underpaid
Do anything but just don’t quit and…

[Chorus: Tdot illdude]
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
(Only thing I ain’t do in that shit was rap Spanish
Goddamn, let me know)
¿'Ónde van? ¿Pa' 'ónde van?
Ya llegó la mexicana hasta con gabán
No ronden tanto, háganse que yo arrebato
Y abran paso, claro que ya no hay atraso
Y cuántas veces hay que confirmar que nadie me llega
La gente me niega, me dicen que se traban, se enredan
Si no me quieren pues me voy como Julieta Venegas
¿Pa' que se me aperra la mente
Si el género se cierra?
Si no eres hombre, no eres nada ¿huh? ja ja ja
He vivido puras fallas y ahora, hm, vu'a ganar
Ya no me cuenten historias más
Ya me robaron la paciencia, ya no vu'a parar

[Chorus: Tdot illdude]
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next
I don't wanna leave
Cause I ain't really done yet
Cause I ain't seen the sun yet
Trying to see what's next
