(Rock and roll)
You got me out here doubting-doubting
I've been drippin'
Tryna find a way
Find a way
You got me out here doubting-doubting
I've been drippin'
Tryna find a way
Find a way
I've been looking for the time

(Rock and roll)

Got-got you got
You got me out here doubting-doubting
I've been drippin'
Tryna find a way
Find a way
You got me out here doubting-doubting
I've been drippin'
Tryna find a way
Find a way

I'm looking for the time
I'm tryna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay
I'm looking for the time
I'm gonna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay

I'm looking for the time
I'm gonna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay
I'm looking for the time
And I've been tryna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay
I'm looking for the time
I'm tryna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay
I'm looking for the time
And I've been tryna find a way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay

Because I've been looking for the time
And I'm gonna find the way
I'm juggling the time upwards to stay
