[Chorus]
How you gonna act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that and you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all
Why you gotta act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that, but you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all

[Verse 1]
One more childish fight one more missed call from you
And now i got one more text you sent telling me that my voicemail box is full
And i dont know what to tell you
I really dont know what what what else to do
When you say you love me but when at the club you act a fool
And you know i got a bunch of calls telling me that my man been acting up again
Telling me that youve been [?] getting drunk with all your friends
And ive been here at home, been thinking bout a lot
Now all that shit you on, now i suggest you stop
Fore you lose that good thing that you got
Cause all that [?] stuff that you talk
Before you get backed up by your actions, you bout to to to get dropped
Cause ive been here at home, been thinking bout a lot
Now all that shit you on, now i suggest you stop

[Chorus]
How you gonna act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that and you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all
Why you gotta act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that, but you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all

[Verse 2]
My bad i ain't gonna answer
Youre a mother-effing jerk, broke dancer
How you act like that then you come right back and expect me to act like a happy camper
Eff that, no deal, im about my bags for real
He'll bring back my automobile with his ass drunk [?] in the front wheel
Cause i seen you in the club, messed up
Yeah i seen you with a couple jefas
At the bar with a hennessy in your red cup
[?] boy you messed up
Man you're gonna try to come right back
Som'thin 'bout the way that you act like that
But i know that youre no good with that espionage act
But wherever i was im gonna come right back

[Bridge]
All the [?] promises of all the things you say
But when you at the party and you wanna play this game
Cause that ain't cool, im out, cause i can't be with you
Cause you can't play four parts
Cause i know what youre trynna do
Youre trying to have a cake and eat it too

[Chorus]
How you gonna act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that and you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all
Why you gotta act like that
Especially when you gon bring your ass right back
I'd kill for you, your all because you talk like that, but you act like that
Baby boy your actions say it all
