[Hook x4]
Bad bitches, bad bitches on deck (stage)
Checking for the cash and I'm cashing all these checks

[Verse 1]
Young mami, flyer than a bitch
All my deal's home-run, don't need to slide in the shit
They can't stop me and its obviously
Cause I just hop up in the booth to show them monsters exist
I never brag about shit but I'ma brag about tonight
I got all the bottles coming and I'm stunting out of spite
Cause these bitches keep on thinking they not finna see me shine
Bitch, I just spent 'bout 30 racks like it ain't shit so fuck your life
I'm saying uhh, who you think brought up all these chicks?
I'm saying uhh, who you think handling her biz?
I got a buzz, probably make me harder than I rip up any track
And still ain't had to show my ass or show you shit
I got a white girl texting from the crowd like "Where you at?"
My ex boyfriend in this bitch and he still tryna get me back
I got a couple Puerto Ricans popping bars up in the back
And I'm still kinda indepo, I keep it Strange like snake and bat
I'm saying

[Verse 2]
Young mami, pulled up in a foreign
I brought all these bitches and I pulled 'em all while touring
Club owner gon' love me, we ain't leaving till the morning
Tell 'em keep on bringing bottles, I was Woke TV recording
I'm like who the fuck 'gon judge us when it's dark outside
If you're hating, then you're broke, bitch, fuck your life
Name your price, if you're nice I can sign you to the label
You can dance up on stage like you're dancing on the table
I'm a boss bitch with a real boss bitch plan
Got deposits and they all big like Roseanne
Best be cautious I got options think fast
Here's the office number call it, this your chance
I never brag about shit but I'ma brag about tonight
I got all the bottles coming and I'm stunting out of spite
Cause these bitches keep on thinking they not finna see me shine
Bitch, I just spent 'bout 30 racks like it ain't shit so fuck your life
