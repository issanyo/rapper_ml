[Intro: Slim Thug]
Yo, this your boy, Slim Thug
Hollering at Snowhite Tha Product

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
The future of the west just came to this third coast
Now my fanbase expanded and I tripled my workload
Now when I drive by, they asking "Man! What's that worth, Snow?"
I'm like "If you want something like this, just hit the chirp phone"
I'm smoking on that purple and I just drove from Cali
And I got a show in Houston, Dallas, [?], and the Valley
And I got that work in the trunk like Chingos bringing some baggies
And I can't complain like most cause I got that money coming at me
And I never really thought that I would leave the west
But I did it and I ended up in the state of Tex
And I keep going hard for my Mexicans
Cause I'll be damned if I don't ever represent
See I'm still up on the block pushing these mixtapes, physically
I run the streets get your product for fixed rates, literally
Get at me

[Chorus: set to A Flock of Seagulls "I Ran"]
I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug)
Cause I still run, the streets all night and day
(If you trying to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (ha)
I can't stay away

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonafide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thinking shit fake? Well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fucking rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowing any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run that
Give her ten and tell her don't bring nothing back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

[Chorus]
