[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Um, you must not know the word value
You grown, find out what it is when a girl get at you
Don't you know what I've been about?
How long I've been down for me to have heard about you?
Trying to go behind my back? Got no time for that
Tryin' to drive birds into my coupe?
You said hold you down
I held you down, I even held you up
No one gave a fuck about your troubles
Who the hell do you think stepped up?
Your memory is fuzzy again
Even your buddies and friends wasn't around
Now that the money come in, you gonna pretend
You don't know who helped you out
Okay, okay, okay, let's both play little games this way
Relocate your pay my way 'for I go take these bills to co-pay
Cause it ain't going down like that
See, I loved you but the truth is
You fucked me over but fucked with my money ughh I'm gonna get ruthless

[Hook:]
You just gotta accept this
It's a wrap, It's a wrap
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is
Imma tell you what the business is
Cause once you're going, there's no coming back
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is
Imma tell you what the business is

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
They gon' mind me, I'm just telling it like it is
I'm just saying that I'm done being the rider chick that you wanted in
Now you switched all of it, cause you be balling in
I was with you in college and didn't I help you through all of it?
Didn't I pay for the deposit and got busted APT?
That we lived in when you act shady?
Now you're gonna act like your chick ain't G?
Cause I'll be damned if you think you're gonna play me
Oh, oh, I wasn't with you shooting in the gym?
Who the fuck do you think held you down when your punk ass didn't win?
Yeah, when you be calling me
When you be crying to me cause you felt like shit
I gave you all of me with no apology and this is the help I get?
Okay, okay, okay, yeah go on and leave then
But as for the keys and Visa, please get the fuck out but just leave them

[Hook:]
You just gotta accept this
It's a wrap, It's a wrap
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is
Imma tell you what the business is
Cause once you're going, there's no coming back
I'm only gonna tell you one time
Imma tell you what the business is
Imma tell you what the business is
