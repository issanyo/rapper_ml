[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Jealousy is a terminal disease
Especially if it ever leaves you to be thinking that you can fuck with me
Don't ever let it fool you make you think you're better because I bet that I could prove to be
The one to get your dreams crushed because we just ain't the same
And it ain't gon' be you're so under me so don't fuck with me
Lemme get a minute of your time to warn any bitches that hate
I think that you need to realize that I have won this race
If the sun came out today then I'd suggest that you don't hate
Because if you are in my way, then this is not your fucking day
See jealous ones still envy, while the broke ones struggle too
Meanwhile they all hate on me, you see my struggles, too?
I've been having them hit up my pay and what promoters do
I heard your new song, Snow, who the fuck you wrote that to?
You, bitch, you! why the fuck you jocking me?
Jealousy will make you bitches hate but you ain't stopping me
Apparently you bitches hate so much, you try to copy me
But no matter how hard you try, you will never be me 'cause you are jealousy

[Hook x2]
Jealousy will make them hate, poverty will make them struggle
Being broke and jealous in the hood can really cause some trouble
I get motivated when I see it in your eyes
I'm the future of this game, you better off keeping me alive

[Verse 2: Havok]
Lemme tell you a little more about jealousy
Make haters sick to their stomach 'cause I am what they pretend to be
It don't really matter, at the end of the day, you niggas ain't stressing me
So keep it moving, get to stepping like a centipede 'cause you my enemy
You envy me, you're turning green and you still wanna go sing with us?
To an earthling, I'm out of this world, somebody bring me up
Fix your face you looking dirty, you can't be clean as us
You's an idiotic dummy, homie, I'm a genius
Matte of fact, you wish you was where one gon' be
You just a 'Shoulda-Woulda-Coulda' while I thought I was a gonna be
Got this jealousy all over your face and wanna come over and say 'what's up?' to me
Pussies like you got leprosy cause you haters ain't touching me
Now you can't fuck with me, my swag and flow is selling bits
I be hitting harder than an elephant 'cause I'm on another level, bitch
I'm like the teacher with the test, for me, you get a 'F'
If you wanna come and test the H of your K, then save your breath
