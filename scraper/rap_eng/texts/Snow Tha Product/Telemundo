[Intro]
Stuck on Telemundo, yeah
You just ruined it for me, I hope you know that

[Verse 1]
I was flipping through channels, trying to watch my soaps
Watching my novela cause its a hell of an episode
Well then my boyfriend called me up
He said he off of work and so - he bringing me some carne asada tacos and a coke
He said he wants to kick it, I said ok
I really haven't seen much of him since the other day
As long as you can keep quiet youre ok with me
My show is on, I will talk during the commercial break
And then he came over he was like what the heck's this crap?
Edgar [?] who the heck is that?
And why can't we just watch the Lakers play against the [?]?
Oh my god look at these freaking dudes they can't act
And then they walked in, I seen his whole attention go to them
I could tell that there is no end
What the heck did i get myself in?

[Verse 2]
All he does is watch the Spanish channel, and that's why
A bunch of big booty Spanish women, and no lie
That boy don't even understand the language, I might cry
Its like he's cheating but he's at my crib and I'm right by
He has a schedule and laughs at stuff that he don't understand
I swear I'm at a 30 minute show from leaving my man
Now he watches my novelas and he acts like he's a fan
But I can tell it's not that it's that the actress' rack is like BAM
And he said no other channel has so many women and
They all practically have no clothes and aw damn
This morning show got chicks in bikinis and they dance
And it's barely about to be 8-freaking-30 a.m
And how am I supposed to compete with that?
That girl right there got like .5% fat
And even if it's plastic she still look hella stacked
And I'm just an average chick who happens to rap
