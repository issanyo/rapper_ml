[Intro]
We all got problems
I been looking and searching
We all got problems
(We all got problems)

[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got problems
I got bitches all in my shit
I been all up all up on positive but
I’m close to loosing my grip
I been killing game like coffin
Had a cough so long ‘cause I’m sick
That shit wasn’t even a clever bar
I can’t beat this cold and I’m pissed
I swear I’ve had torn vocal cords since twenty-ten
How in the fuck do I get through events?
How do I tour more than most of you rappers
Meet every fan, shake hands and kiss kids?
Humbleness shit something I’ve been
Tryna kick I’ve been thinking y'all kids
Incompetent when It’s all this ignit
No bars, all fiction, no frauds, to get rich
So fuck it then ya gonna have to pardon my ruggedness
I’ma win I was tryna keep it one hunnit and
Half of ya don’t even double-check the amount
Brag but don’t even got a checking account
Bitches better give this shit a rest and be out
Yes little mex best flex checks running out
Tryna keep it humble couple fans stressing me now
Yelling “Snow put the fucking Cortez in a mouth!”

[Hook]
Yeah we all got problems
Yeah I been looking and searching and shit
We all got problems

[Verse 2]
Uh, Yeah, look yeah bitch I’ll beat that
Everybody got opinions on
I be having hate wherever bitches see me on
Haters nowdays are fucking chamillions
Pretending like their friends but I don’t see TV on
Well hold’em up
All you motha fuckas tryna go on up
Tryna skip steps move fast
Got you throwing up folding up
First got the bitch and you showing up
Bro you got a beard and you got your period
You hoeing up hold up
Not today Papa

Get a real man
Hit you with the fade and I
Really be sippin margaritas in the shade you brought
Oh na na na na Yo whats all this shit about?
Bad news really get around

Y'all pissing me off I’m in my feelings now, ‘bout to go off

[Hook]

Humble this shit something I’ve been

Humble this shit something I’ve been
Bitches better give this shit a rest and be out
Yelling “Snow put the fucking Cortez in a mouth!”
