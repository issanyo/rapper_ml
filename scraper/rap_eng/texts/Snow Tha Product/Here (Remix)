[Intro: Alessia Cara]
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being

[Verse 1]
I'll be right here while y’all figure out what you want
Whether y’all want bitches hoes or women
And while the rap game pimp all these no clothes hoes
Snow gone flow and Imma hit the road again
And here goes the Henny we on in 20
We load the mini van and we get to killing all these shows, so many
That I been wondering how anyone deny it when the fans just wanna buy it
Maybe 'cause they can’t control whats in me
Y’all so dependent on what these fuckin' hype beasts say
Imma kick back 'cause all of y’all cliche
You say you getting bread but you fetchin' cheesecake
And how the fuck are y’all freshmen if y’all Pre-K
'Cause these days the he say she say relay
Getting wack y’all goofy, aw man, for pete's sake
You pretend you in the game like EA
How are y’all sleepin' on me like p.j.'s
Y’all the reason I ain't fuckin' had my heart in
I know that I'm the only options for what's authentic
I know somebody gotta get the blame, so I'll get it
'Cause I done set to do this shit and now its all feeling
Like Gotdamn I'm all in it
And I’m thinking I’m too raw with it
They carcinogen processed beef, they all gimmick
I’ve bodied beats with the best of the beasts and I'm killin
They ending bitches 15 minutes in like 5 minutes
I'll be here, I’m still but not stuck
While they want me selling out and tell me that I’m not enough
I'll look whoever in the eye and let 'em know that it's been tough
But I would rather earn it all than have whoever think it's luck
Or have a rapper think its 'cause I worked off of their buzz
'Cause I’m not gon' kiss up, I’m not gon' give up
Or lose articles of clothing, this not a strip club
One of the best to do it quote me, I don’t give a fuck
'Cause to these suits:
Oh, I ain't black and I ain't white, so I don’t gotta lane
And I ain't got a Nicki budget, and I ain't got a Wayne
And I ain't K Dot either, I don’t gotta Dre
And I ain't J-Cole or Sean, so I don’t got a J
All I gotta say is "Gotdamn! Oh, man! This my luck"
What I get for being a female with a flow so tough
For hitting 8 tours without as much as a tour bus
I did it all and if you're lookin' for me you're in luck
I'll be here
