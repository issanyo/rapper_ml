[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Yo, look
Um you said I met you at a bad time, okay
You got an ex and hope the bad vibes go away
But there's a reason that you met me, ain't it?
Look I'm a Cancer, I save everyone that don't need savin'
I mean I probably fucked up soon as I met you, huh?
Something told me get you, uh
Looking at me soon as I walked in, like I could bet you, I
Know what drink you bout to buy me, line you bout to tell me
Let me give your ass a break like Recess, I'll be your Spinelli
I-I-I ain't tryna get involved
I wanna get the call like
"What you doin' tomorrow?"
"I don't know but I'm off, why?"
"Cause' I'm tryna know if you can go to this event, look I don't got a date to take, but I would love to take a friend."
So we go and then it's lit, it's on some rom-com shit
I mean the ambiance, boujee, a bidi bom bom a bit
And your up-tight, out my league fancy ass get
You had the answers all along, you need a Mexican chick

[Chorus]
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
She say
Call me what you want, just never call me after midnight
She needs me to go over and do that thang right
Got me saved under Sabrina in her new phone
I don't mind playing in the back if her dude know
But she workin' it, yeah I know she workin' it
Keep it on the low cause' she know that there's people lurking it
It don't make no difference, I ain't fighting for position
I know when to hit you back, and when I gotta keep my distance
But now I gotta keep you on your toes
My girl was questioning me on why I received a text from Domino's (damn)
I mean, come on now you know how it goes
You know what time of day to hit me
Why you act gotta like you ain't know? yeah
Let me know when you'll be free again
Pick you up and take you places you ain't never been
And tell your mans to chill out, why he always hatin'?
Like damn dog I like her too, even if y'all dating

[Chorus]
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind

[Verse 3: Lex The Great]
Yuh
In case you change your mind, let me tell you something
Yeah you bangin' up your vibes, I need a couple doses
I might just fuck around and sip up, overdose then black out
Might fall in love with that ass, I plan to find out
I ain't tryna cuff you either, girl it's all good
I'm with the whole wink emoji, being fresh too
I know you busy and I'm busy too
Tryna do what it do, I ain't gon' press you
I'm gon' fall back, figure out what's best for you
Can I hit in the morning?
Shit if we both playin', it's only right we set some rules
And I'm just saying it could really work, [?]
But what your girls tell you, listen what I'm saying
Dime que te quedes, dime que te quedes
Girl I'm with the cards whenever we can get it
Dime que te quedes, yeah

[Chorus]
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind
Let me play the background baby
That way you could take your time
But it's worth the thought now ain't it?
I mean just in case you change your mind
