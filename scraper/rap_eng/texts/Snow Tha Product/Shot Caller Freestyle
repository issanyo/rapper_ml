Yo, look, um, my flow presidential
I set precedent and get precedence
Gettin' influential, now my delegates gettin' elegance
And they represent what I represent
And they rep in this 'til the death of them
And I get respect cause I got a team
And I work hard to do my best for them
Mothafuckas pissed, so y'all be gettin' mad
But fuck it, hating is the cheapest hobby that you can have
So you can "Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate" to your play
My team get cake and it’s eat or get ate
So we be gaining weight
I'm a baller, I'm a fucking shot caller
So if you're looking for a ho, then you can go and call her
Sn-sn-snowy be your boss
Meet CEO status
And you say you gettin' money
I'm a motherfuckin' capitalist
Not a pacifist, I'm a leader and
Got bitches cut before you see their ring
Put'em up got'em bobbin' and I weave in'em
Rap chicks ain't no problem for me to fix
If you talking 'bout profits, we seeing it
I'm the Product I've got the receipt for it
If you're beefing then I'm guaranteeing that
I’ll put shells in your talk (taco) over cheese and shit
BITCH!
