[Music Video Intro]
[Woman:] What's up? What's wrong?
[Snow:] Let's kill this motherfucker
[Woman:] Yeah, but what's wrong though?
[Snow:] I feel fucking disrespected, and this is what the fuck I do, I fucking kill people. So if you're riding, we're going, and if not, get the fuck out
[Woman:] Shit, I'm down
[Snow:] Let's go then


[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
If a fight break out your lights may go out and
Might he slow your life, know your life span
Try with all your might but you just can't
See you slept when you stepping on me
Can digging your join your jeffer with me
Don't pretend number one contender
Not what you're used to, juice you like blender
If busting is a crime I'm the first offender
Can open up a can, on your ass is tender
And got a proper referee never to have a legacy
Who be the best of the best and I'm guessing me (You're guessing me)
And break down a sixteen if it's clean, not missing
Not one thing is glistening, it's pristine, you're listening to

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

'Cause then they ruin ya

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Look, Snow White
Now when I step in these bitches that sitting
Finna get the fuck up
I'mma make 'em all get dead
I’m a Mexican wreckin', like a drunk in a truck
When I said I'm the best then, this a statement
No question, and I don’t give a fuck
And you said that you fly, you habitual liar
You comin' against me, you shit out of luck
I'ma come through and damage everything that you own
Everything that you like, if you ain't understanding
Is it hard to decode? Can you see in my eyes
That I'm not to be played with, I'm possibly crazy and nuts?
See monstrosities constantly all in the back of my mind
Bitch I damage everything that’s average
I'ma kill em again, I go H.A.M. no sammich
No spittin' in Spanish Mami si que anda al cien
Ahora si, si, Ven contra mi, mi. Let's do it again
Compra mi CD, te mato a ti, ti, y mato a tus friends

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Now to the people, the people they see no evil, the people love us
There is no evil, then if you peeping then leave him to us
We from the steeple but even we can be mean when we bust
Not just a little, we tryna eat up your vittles for lunch (keep goin')
I think my sequel Genius wasn't equal, people seen us they was teekel
That we seem to be leakin' too much (and then?)
You still be getting beaten and see the repeatedly, repeating our frequency
Guess I'm just speaking too much
