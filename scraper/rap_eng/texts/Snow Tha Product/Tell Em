[Chorus x2]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this and you can tell 'em that
But I'm out getting chips, and where the hell you at?

[Verse 1]
Pockets kinda chunky, call them Campbell's
Deep pockets and y'all looking kinda shallow
So these haters getting mad
Cause they can't get out my shadow
But the product got the weapon
And the posse got the ammo
If you wanna bust a Rambo i can bust a soprano
Cause the clique stays strapped like some Jesus sandals
I'll be this, I'll be that, but don't believe a word of them
'Cause that shit's just as fake as the stupid bitch you heard it from
I'm killing game and burgling them, spitting flames and burning them
These haters don't deserve me, huh, they mad 'cause I be serving them
No time for being worrisome, these haters ain't nothing
And I got a poker face on but all these bitches bluffing
This chick's hot as an oven, the product stopping for nothing
I'm popping, locking, and busting, these chickens off and be clucking
So watch me get my duckets and ride this thing out
Snow Tha Product's in this bitch, whatchu gotta say now?

[Chorus x2]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this and you can tell 'em that
But I'm out getting chips, and where the hell you at?

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Tell them all that you done met me and I'm stuck up
That I ain't ever going to do shit and that I'm fucked up
Tell them whatever you want cause I am whats up
And I know that you mad cause you're trash, dump truck
So run your mouth, tell your buddies that I'm not the shit
But when they get my mixtape and you're not hot as this
You about to watch your friends turn around the opposite
Direction as you question how can they be down with product bitch
So tell tell tell stories just as fake as you
And talk talk talk as much as all haters do
And every time you talk music, bring my name up, boo
Cause while you talk shit in your mamma's crib, I'm making loot
So bitter haters make your YouTube comments
Cause I'm the shit and your boo boo honest
So let me do me while you do not shit
Money talks but you ain't on the same topic

[Chorus x2]
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this, that
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em this and you can tell 'em that
But I'm out getting chips, and where the hell you at?
