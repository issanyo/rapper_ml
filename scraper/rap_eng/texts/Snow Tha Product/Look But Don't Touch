[Chorus]
Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)

Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)

[Verse 1]
Guess who's fresher than the veggie, no reggie, all perk
Guess who drove up in this Chevy, already got work
It's that click of loud kids with two cases of Privilege
All of y'all wishing but you should face it, we living this
Club hopping, wasted, new generation
Walk up in the scene, fit, mean, and we got them hatin'
Party like a rocker, no, party like a college kid
Pop some in, we pop some more, won't remember what we did
All up in the club, boys staring and they checking us
Crew doing big, going hard and got us flexing bucks
Chain is on my chest is, uh, sick, no congestion, bruh
Been up all night and it's 2am and the best is yet to come
Go, go, go, like a P-p-power Ranger
And I blow more dro 'til I can't think an hour later
I'm living for the moment and I still don't give a fuck
And all you haters free to look but i suggest you don't touch

[Chorus]
Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)

Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)

[Verse 2]
Pink and black Dunks, tight, and my jacket dumb bright
Stunners on my face and got the place going in one night
All I got's this one life, so Imma live it up
And I know the bartender, so my cups is filling up
And I got these boys saying 'what's up'
And I go the club showing me love
So Imma get up in the middle with the flow and show them Snow be going d-dumb
Me and my girls know how to stunt on some evil cannibal stuff
Get the place crunk, come with us, and you 'gon see what's up
Get it big, spilling drinks, sipping on expensive shit
Living big, getting chicks, spending all them Benjamins
Get the whip cause I think we 'gon have to dip again
Another party down the block and we 'gon start this shit again
Go, go, go, like a P-p-power Ranger
And I blow more dro 'til I can't think an hour later
Im living for the moment and I still don't give a f-fuck
And all you haters I suggest you don't t-touch

[Chorus]
Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)

Cause we young, fly, and flashy and we don't give a fuck
I'm just walking with my partners and we tearing up the club
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
Don't touch (You can look but)
