You all I think about, yeah

It don't matter how we find a way
And I don't care who ain't or who with me now
You came around and everything done changed now
Everybody got somethin' to say now
Say you on your way now, say it's gettin' late now
Checking, everybody went to bed it's okay now
Hit me up
"Where you at?"
Hit-hit you back like
"Come 'round back."
'Cause I got my parents home
They don't know where I go, yeah
Dip quick they don't ask
Park in the cut just wait on that
'Cause you know lately all they be on is hatin' on us, yeah

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
Hit me up late at night
And I'll go pick you up
Hit you up when I'm down the street from ya
I don't mind makin' that 20 minute trip for ya
And I'm swangin' through traffic, won't crash it
Addict for that shit you havin'
I just wanna get a minute or two
To show you what you really need and 'bout to get into
I'll come through tonight, whatever you like
You know that it's right, reminiscin' with you
'Bout every one of those times
I'm talking 'bout whenever I would sneak inside of your room
Through your window even though both your parents was home, damn
Ain't it crazy how shit is changin' now and we get faded
Whenever we get jaded now
'Cause you can hit my line and I'ma pull up, yeah yeah
