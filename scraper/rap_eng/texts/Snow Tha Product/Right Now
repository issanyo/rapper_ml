I ain't even gon' front with you
I'm just really tryna fuck with you
And I hate to waste your time, I ain't tryna make you mine
Make your mind up, let me know what's up with you
Send your location my way
See if I stop by today, if I go I can't stay
Stop for some Henny on the way
Let me know what's on your plate
Yeah, I'm known to act a fool
What you really tryna do?
Say you really tryna drink, well tryna do that too
I ain't tryna be your dude
But for you, this is somethin' new
I'm about to head my way, it's a quarter after two

[Verse 3: AJ Hernz]
Even though I'm out in California, I keep it 100 Arizona
You just think I'm out here for the sex, and I'm fuckin' with ex
And I'm on to the next (aye)
I know I'm always gone like soldiers
Chasin' this dream now it works, yeah
Shit is gettin' crazy everyday
'Cause I never plan to stay and I always go away, yeah
Tell you on the phone, just started from the bottom
Never know where I should be, runnin' from the truth
Now I run into you
Never had juice, I'm squeezin' you
Always havin' nothing is a struggle, I been dealin' with pain
And they wonder why I'm never okay
I know you wanna ride tonight, even though I ain't your type

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
I'm about to fuckin' waste yo time, waste yo time
But I can give it to you right now, right now, right now
Right now, yeah
I'm about to fuckin' waste yo time, waste yo time
But I can give it to you right now, right now, right now
Right now, yeah
