[Verse 1]
Yo, look, huh, yo
Well if it ain't that hot spitta, guap getter, that's Snow
All in the hospital they go
Hop in the Benz, Jetta or Rolls whether ballin' or broke
I'ma kill 'em all slow
And I'll be walkin' with a bunch of swag
But fuck that word, yo fuck I'm back
And she just like Kirko, yep it Bangz
And I'm beatin' motherfuckers like a punching bag
When I walk up in the club and these boys wanna look
Paint wetter than the tub, in a tom rollin' up
You can check all of my phones
And you know I'm comin' up
'Cause I made a couple fuckin' hundred grand in a month
And I got the rubber bands that'll snap right back
And I got the upper hand 'cause I came right back
Like I never ever left, 'cause I'm sick like that
Cali-swag with the pistol grip pump on my lap

[Hook]
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Trón and vodka, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup

[Verse 2]
Yo, umm, umm, hola, what's up
Got the purple in the double cup
And I'm so high, got 'em all lookin' up
And I bet every guy in the club wanna touch
Little chick with the shades and the smile in the chucks
Bet they all blind if they don't look at us!
'Cause the girl with the crunk group of girls yellin' what
Throwin' bows, gettin' drunk, but it's us in the club
They be yellin' out break it out, pour that drank
Break it down, smoke that dank
Gonna make it loud, what y'all think
Got purple clouds, and my sprite stay pink
And I got 'em messed up, but these girls stay trippin'
But not this girl, 'cause this girl stay pimpin'
And I was always taught get in where you fit in
And I fit in real well in like every single city

[Hook]
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Trón and vodka, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup

[Verse 3]
Yo, look, umm, now I be knowin' everybody wanna come alive
When I arrive and I be spittin' that fire
Everybody got the look in their eyes
When I get down on stage, and then I get a little higher
'Cause I buy y'all bars, y'all thought y'all star
My crew don't ever get tired
'Cause they're wired, liquor buyers, higher
Just a smile for the little picture on the flyer
Chicks stay shocked how we steppin' about
Cars with no top how we gettin' around
Thought y'all hot, but we coolin' 'em down
All my guns gon' clap while we checkin' the sound

[Hook]
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Hola, hola, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Trón and vodka, bitch que pasa, break out the Patrón and vodka
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up
Break it out, toke it up, mix that shit up in my cup
