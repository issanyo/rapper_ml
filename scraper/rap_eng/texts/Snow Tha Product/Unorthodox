[Verse 1]
You can't tell me I'm not trying to be part of society
You can't tell me I ain't give it a shot
You can't say I ain't at least try to be
All of the normal things that girls sposed to brought
Up to be but look at the fuckery
All these rappers are bringing to y'all
Now you better hold up for the ride of your life
When I slide in the game I'm motherfucking going off
I've been waiting to let go
And I really gotta admit I know that I been doing a great job
I came to disinfect yo
Little memory bank of the basicest shit the game got
I came to disconnect yo headphones
So you let go of the dumb shit you've been taught
Like that I gotta sell sex because males
Get upset if I don't sell show and bear it all
Eff that, scratch that, fuck that shit
Get back ho back back what's up with
This lack of rap tracks that make some sense
I ain't talking about conscious rap but oh shit
How many people balling, but the economy fucked
How many people all up in dope and they sell drugs
If it's every single rapper who buying the dope huh?
But why your baby hella dirty and you froze up
Please quit with the act OK I'll go first
We gon' be bringing it back and I'mma say it all in one verse
Beans gon' be spilled out of the bag
And maybe a couple of feelings will get hurt
So if you ain't got thick skin, bitch
You better get in your little bubble and keep rolling or kick dirt

[Verse 2]
See I'm tired of all of this internet talk
'cuz of internet balls, in your internet drawls
On some internet blogs, talking internet fraud
With anonymous comments you probably aren't
Even close to cool, or you failed ass artist
Probably got shut when you started
And now you wanna talk about shit 'cuz you just aren't
Any where close to being what you wanted
If you don't like something why do you comment?
Why you all up in it and why you watch it?
And why would you gossip, about all this nonsense?
It's funny cause lately men be obnoxious
Really? You mean to tell you think that I don't know that I ain't black?
Or that I don't know that
Usually Latin girls ain't really been all up in rap
I didn't know that my color or gender
Can be the preventer of getting on tracks
Well really it's not
It's just a couple ignorant basic-ass people that just say that
But they all wack and they got no swag
And they all probably live with their mom and dad
And they probably broke and they got no chance
To ever do be doing what I'm doing and that's sad
See, 'cuz last time I checked they play Hip Hop in the hood
And I dare you to find a hood
With no Latins in it because I don't think that you could
See last time that I checked they play Hip Hop in the hood
And I dare you to find a hood
With no Latins in it because I don't think that you could
