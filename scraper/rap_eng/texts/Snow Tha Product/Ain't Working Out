[Verse 1]
It's been seven days and I ain't talk to him or tried
He stopped coming by to talk and I know why
Cause it's really been too much to deal
What part of this is supposed to be love for real?
The fighting, the fussing too much and still somehow I can't hide the fact
I feel that I would be the one to really put it all aside
The drama, the jealously fights and lies, the gossip they be telling me scars my pride
I swear it ain't easy but we've been through so much, I have to try
I know he did wrong, I know I slipped, ain't no reason to deny what I did
Yeah he took out some chick in my whip, and yes I found out and I did my shh...
What does he do? He gets mad cause I got even but he's a man
He said: "You don't get your man back like that"
Things get heated and of course I fight back
I talk issh, he replies, he talks about girls and I talk about guys
He take it too far and of course I cry
But you know how things get when you and your man fight
Maybe it's me but I think it's him
He thinks I'm wrong but in a fight who wins?
He's yelling and screaming, you know how things get
Too elevated, now I'm feeling sick
At the end of this fight, I know this is it
It's just too hard and I know we both win
Doing too much, we both kinda quit
Now I already regret what I said and I did
But damn!

[Hook]
It started out but everything ain't working out
And I want to love you but I don't have to work this out
You know it started out but everything ain't working out
And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out

[Verse 2]
Let's chat for a minute
Let me get a drink, let me think, let me sit down and talk if you with it
I wanna let you know that I got other men that would more than really like to get with a chick that live on her own
And her life is filled with international trips and chills and hot sandy beaches in Brazil
So boy calm down, let's keep this real
I wanna get a little bit into the fact
I wanna feel you really know what you have
You gotta appreciate me and get that
What you can do, I do right back
I don't need you, I mean I like you yeah but my girl told me every guy's a player
So I don't let my heart get attached
You be lucky to have me in your life for real
So value me and you should know that we are both the same
And if this keeps up, we both can leave
Just know that I ain't gon' beg and I ain't gon' die if you don't stay with me
So let this be your warning, you be lucky to have a lil' chick like me
Cause I'm independent and I really don't think that there's many women that can do what I do when they speak a sentence
I'm a boss, and I make all the dough and spend it
So just know this, you dealing with a chick that can take you or leave you boy
I don't need your shh...

[Hook]
It started out but everything ain't working out (Ohh...)
And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out
It started out but everything ain't working out
And I wanted to love you but I don't have to work this out

[Bridge]
I just can't wait for you to change cause you ain't getting any of this
Ohh...
Yeah he took out some chick in my whip, yes I found out and I did not shh...
Don't bother calling me on my phone cause you ain't getting any of this
What you can do, I do right back, I don't need you

[Hook]
It started out but everything ain't working out
Don't you call me on my phone but I don't have to work this out
And I wanted to love you but everything ain't working out
Ohh...
But I don't have to work this out
