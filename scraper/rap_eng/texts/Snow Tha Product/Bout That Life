[Verse 1]
Yo, look
Always been the type to overthink
Which caused all this fear in me
But I ain't never been scared
And I been full aware
But the truth in this shit killin' me
Cause I know this world
And I know a girl
Like me ain't really gonna change it all
But I know I've worked
And I know they heard
That me and my partners came to ball
And ain't nothing gonn' stop this
Cause I do it for more than my pockets
And I do it for more than just dough
There's more to Miss Snow
Find out 'fore you talk shit
Cause I got a crew of kids that's involved
I do this music for y'all
I'm out here touring this hard
Just know this winner won't fall
And I go HAM cause I know my chances
Have gone by half cause [?]
And I know I'm gonn' have to be all I can
Cause all my fam seeing all this

[Bridge]
Man tell 'em that am gonn' need all this cash (now)
I'mma take it to Vegas
Paid dues so I'll cash out
While these haters all hating
I'mma live

[Hook]
Cups get fucked up, cause things are workin' out
There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Elevator to the top)
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Been workin' with what we got)
So now we're cups up, get fucked up cause things are workin' out
There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Elevator to the top)
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Been workin' with what we got)


[Verse 2]
Man, I've been about it
Everyone but this pen has doubted
Look bro, I been alone
And I been at home
Wit' like 20 in the bank but the rent's a thousand
Had a one bedroom
And I built me a booth
Paid for Pro Tools
Got a pull out couch
Slept in the living room
Made Ramen Noodle soup
No food don't tell me what being down is
I've worked for this
Let 'em know what my verses is
When I'm in the booth and I heard a bitch
Tryna talk down if she ain't heard my shit?
Man, I ain't got no time for that
I grind it out my mind as I got [?]
I done been out findin' out
What life's about
I'm tryna see past, all the negativity
That these bitches be
Tryna throw my way, cause I spinnin' these
Little cold ass verses
I'm visiting, a couple of cities a day and they be feeling me
Cause man, I been workin' so long
Cause this game is all about rhymin'
I hustle days in, hustle dapes in
Now they payin' for my rhymes and I'm getting
Cake cake cake cake (ahh)
Man, I'm gettin' paid so fuck the
Hate hate hate hate
Man, that's if you hate I'm paid
And so now they havin' opinions
Back in the day they didn't cop my tape
They didn't not give a shit so fuck they feelings (ahh)

[Hook]
Cups get fucked up, cause things are workin' out
There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Elevator to the top)
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life
(Been workin' with what we got)
So now we're cups up, get fucked up cause things are workin' out
There's buzz up in the lobby and we're what they talkin' 'bout
Tell 'em that I'm 'bout that life

[Outro x2]
Tell 'em put me on
Tell I'mma shine
Cause don't nobody know what I been through
Cause it's a crime
But I'm 'bout that life
(I'm 'bout that life, mayne)
Tell 'em I'mma be alright
(I think we gon' be alright)
