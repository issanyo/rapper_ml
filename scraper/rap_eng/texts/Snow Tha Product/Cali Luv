[Verse 1]
Hot mama from California
The senorita, the reason these whores be up
Pour me up, drink in a 40 up
45, 40 ounces in 40 cups
Good nights, motherfucker, bad mornings, huh
Good kush bad bitch is the formula
Course we up, everybody on Morpheus
Smoking till we get cataracts in our corneas
I’m in factor up in it, back to cash getting
I relax for a minute, back to fast living
I’ve been acting and we have to crash in it
‘Cause this rap shit is in me, have to have work

[Bridge]
And it’s all black, everything down to the socks
Kill em, leave evidence, motherfuck a cop, cop
Hit ‘em like mary jane, I don’t need a wedding ring
OG’s out, yeah, I’m married to the block

[Hook]
Tryina get to this function
I’m just tryna get shots
Come from nothing to something
Reppin' Cali like Pac
Steppin’ at it, we stuntin’
You have to do what y’all want
Ain’t no need to be frontin’
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
California love

[Verse 2]
Killer Cali in a Caddy
San Jo' shark in the central valley
Haters gonna get but no one getting at me
8 bandanas in a black Denali
And these haters all cop but my clock tick tock
Haters all watch but I’m ‘bout to go off
Snow go hard wrist, froze like a rock
Got a black Mac 10 with my MAC lip gloss
Got good kush and the weather is gorgeous
Ended up like you know what work is
Hell yeah, bitch, I don’t work I rob this
And I still rock a beanie and a hoodie in Cortez

[Bridge]
And it’s all black, everything down to the socks
Kill em, leave evidence, motherfuck a cop, cop
Hit ‘em like mary jane, I don’t need a wedding ring
OG’s out, yeah, I’m married to the block

[Hook]
Tryina get to this function
I’m just tryna get shots
Come from nothing to something
Reppin' Cali like Pac
Steppin’ at it, we stuntin’
You have to do what y’all want
Ain’t no need to be frontin’
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
‘Cause it’s all about that
California love
