[Intro]
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
This is where they die

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
I seem to be the best to have no comparison
Depict pictures with words, I'm a description specialist
Snowhite's the best and yes
Snow white its evident
I walk into the vocal booth and leave it hotter than the desert is
Yall notice my emphasis, im standing alone
Ill have time to rest when im happily taking that throne
Ive been working at this relentlessly, haven't yall known?
I ain't quitting till ive devoured all these bastards that flow
Ill pass them, then go faster till i can't anymore
Imma climb up to the top and imma bash in the door
And they be crazy that maybe they be matching my flow
I got bars, sweetheart, im a master at those
No longer when ikill beats, im a [?] yo
Im doing rational catastrophies with [?] and more
I wanna wipe out beats cause i be gassing they know
Im not stopping till i can bring all these masses to shows
I go

[Outro]
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
This is where we fight
