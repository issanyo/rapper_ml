I hit the snooze at least five times
Alarm set to like 9 times
And every time my iPhone alarm go off my heart stops
I check the watch and check the clock
Goddamn time flies
Check twitter and Instagram timelines
A bunch of happy hashstags like #grindtime
Rise and shine, advice how I should be so happy
I subscribed to my life, literally living in a white lie
Yippee yippee yippee I should be so happy I'm
In 2016 and not living in the past where I
A brown person would be called colored but then not brought up in conversations about race
Because the world is black and white
But that happened like literally yesterday
Race lately on some gang shit like, "What set you claim?"
Don't hesitate to be so meek and flaca when I speak 'bout raza
But then Mexicans the first ones fuckin' hecklin' me
So everybody should have mixed babies
Black, white, brown, Asian, let's get racy
Mix it up a little in the name of future blurred colored lines
To define people by what's inside everybody's skin's praline
And bi-racial, bi-partisan, bi-sexuals
Don't buy lies, buy organic vegetables
Buy them from a Mexi tho, in a truck from Mexico
America's obsessed with making things so big except the clothes
Over-sexualized mass media
Over exposed so bright you can't see enough
So no details, just females, being the shells of beings
No substance so emotionally these teens are fucked
And that's why everyone is like fuck it all, life's a bitch
My brain need Adderall, my heart gon' quit
If I don't take it, I'm noddin' off, the boredom hits
My ADD is to blame for all, the childish shit
We're all walking contradictions, we're all attention deficit
But need all the attention that any one person can give
We suffer from depression and then we try to lessen it
By making all these Benjamins, and Jacksons, even Jeffersons
I swear that even I'm stuck in a cycle that's indefinite
I figured it all out like five years ago and ever since
I bitch about it every single morning in my bed and shit
And then my mother fucking 5 minutes snooze time ends again
