The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
Stay out all night 'cause I’m looking right, hey
Ladies throw your hands up
Stay out all night 'cause I’m looking right, hey
And were the hottest ladies in sight

My mom’s a lawyer, my dad’s a doctor
My sister went and married the money and got a baller
My brother is a college scholar, and I’m that bad girl daughter
They say I fell off the family tree, my life’s too modern
So they call me party girl, I call them boring
If you ever hear about a party on the weekend call me and inform me
‘Cuz I will go like E40, put my big shades on
If they was thinking I was gonna chill at home they wrong
‘Cuz they outdated like payphones but I’m a real star I’m arriving late, huh
I’m gonna show up already tipsy, with a smile on my face and I’m gonna say cheese
Whenever anybody wanna take flicks of me
Pose pout my lip and my hands like these
Takin’ MySpace flicks, flicks
That’s all they get, get
‘Cuz I’ve been drinking since I was at home and I have continued since

‘Cuz I’m a bad girl that’s popular, that parties like a rocker does
All the boys are checkin’ ‘cuz I’m always at the hottest club
Walk like a model but I speak my mind
And if they’re hatin’ let ‘em, I don’t got no time

The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
Stay out all night 'cause I’m looking right, hey
Ladies throw your hands up
Stay out all night 'cause I’m looking right, hey
And were the hottest ladies in sight

I take body shots of Patrón, the party stops when I’m gone
And everybody knows I’m the party, I’m popular and I’m known
I’m poppin’ bottles, I’m drunk
Can’t stop me now ‘cuz I’m grown
And I’ve been staring at the guy by the bar and I’m thinking ‘bout takin’ him home
Imma get get naughty, Imma sip sip Bicardi
‘Cuz I’ve been drinking so much and yes I know I’m the life of the party
If you don’t like it I’m sorry, I’m living like it’s my body
So if you wanna lecture me get in line, ‘cuz who made you Mr. Miyagi
‘Cuz I’m gunna have my fun, I’m gunna stay out ‘til the sun
Comes up to the fun, Up to the bars, shots down, and there’s no more rum
I’m living life in the club, I’m popping bottles of bub
And pardon me if I’m not at home crying alone and looking for love

‘Cuz I’m a bad girl that’s popular, that parties like a rocker does
All the boys are checkin’ ‘cuz I’m always at the hottest club
Walk like a model but I speak my mind
And if they’re hatin’ let ‘em, I don’t got no time


The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
The party just ain’t poppin’ ‘til we walk in, yeah
Stay out all night 'cause I’m looking right, hey
