[Verse 1: AJ Hernz]
Yeah I might just pull up on sight, yeah
My purple drink and some sprite, yeah
I'm out of Texas, yeah
But I'm in LA for the night
How 'bout I book you a flight
Wrack up the miles tonight, yeah
I know you workin', yeah
But you should do more with your time

[Pre-Chorus: AJ Hernz]
I might not play in the major leagues
But I've been ballin' in these streets
Running it up in the bills, yeah
I am as cool as Pharrell, yeah
Ballin' with you like a bell, yeah
I'm feeling more like myself, yeah

[Chorus: AJ Hernz & Snow Tha Product]
I ain't gonna pass you up
Baby I rock witcha
Running the numbers up
Shooting my shot witcha
Yeah, tell me what's stopping you, yeah yeah
Nobody blocking you, yeah yeah
We could be ballin', yeah yeah
Haters just watchin' us, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
I'ma just say how I feel, yeah yeah
Guess it ain't obvious
You make it hard to be real, yeah yeah
Might be a lot for you
But when we chillin' it's a vibe, yeah
You gotta know are we texting or talkin', yeah
Cause when these notifications be poppin' in
I just look down at my phone and be smilin', yeah
I might just hit you tonight, yeah
Tell you to get a flight, yeah
I'm tired of textin', yeah
I'm might be spending the night, yeah
Make sure that I'm looking right, yeah
Tonight I got nothing but time, yeah
Cool as my Henny on ice, yeah
When you with me it's a vibe, yeah

[Chorus: AJ Hernz & Snow Tha Product]
