[Verse 1 - Berner]
Yeah, where the whole damn bay at?
06, H-Town with the gray pack
New bands come found, like a Maybach
I smoked out with my luv, bro, asap
Get yo mind right, baby, that’s a downgrade
My new bitch get money outta town, babe
New sneakers, no 2-seaters?
I’m shotgun with a dirty 2 liter
She like to work the stripclub, don’t she?
Bar is too crowded, I’mma hit the Pink Poney
I’m drunk off wine, shout at E-40
Earl Steve taste good with the OG, homie
Yeah, this bay bizz, I’m in the space ship
My lil homie keep the cannon, get yo face lit (Yeah)
Huh, lemme show ya how the cake flip
I got rich with the Asians
Nay, sham, blue, cherry pop wire real cookies turn blue
Y’all gettin’ no money and I feed my whole crew
Broad pinned outside, I dunno bout you
Tell yo baby momma hi, I’mma call later
When she come on from work, she give me all the paper
It’s a bay thing and I ain’t ever buy the scraper
I been in European whips, fuck all my haters
(Young Bern)

[Hook - Sage The Gemini]
I'm a foreign man
Foreign bitches Foreign dance
I go over sea's & get foreign bands
If you ain't talkin money I don't understand
If you ain't talkin money I don't understand
Planes in my left
I got the world in my other hand
I got work in the motherland
If you ain't talkin money I don't understand
If you ain't talkin money I don't understand

[Verse 2 - Keak Da Sneak]
Talk dollars I could feel it standing
Straight days -----?----- Never empty handed
Stunt a nigga growth when I get ----?----
So if it ain't about bands Ain't no use saying it
I'm strapped No brainer shit
Niggas sprayin it
& it's a wrap in the booth When a nigga landed
Spit it for the area O'bannon
Shit wack in the whip nigga No planning
YSL Belt see it on the buckle
Versace paragon Rock it nigga Hustle
I'm sweatin like I'm off the molly
Louis Gucci down Roberto De--------
Benz & a Porsche Can't leave here without em
So I hop in a drop --------?-------------
Cuttin corners doin a hundred
Leaving it cloudy
This dedicated to the haters
Them niggas that doubted

[Verse 3 - Snow Tha Product]
Uh, look, yo Snow White Tha Product
Outchea goin harder
Bitches thought I quit
Oh no, I just paused it like a comma
I just took a break and shit
To spend some on my momma
But I got her ass a house
And now I'm back to get this gwola
Pale skin mexi, classic like a chevy
I'ma kill the game
Whether or not these bitches let me
Jordan's are just seven's
Latin bitches sexy, how you gonna beat me
If your ass can't even catch me
You can miss me with the bullshit
You can hit me with the digits
You can call me what you want
But I only pick up for business
Why you bitches trippin
'Cause your boyfriend out here diggin
I would probably rather pull your ass
Cash out while you stripping
I was raised on Mac Dre
40 Water and some Thizzin
And I wouldn't have no bay in me
If I was in here pimpin
Got a lil shark here
Shit finna change up
GET WOKE
Catch a show
Bitch, WAKE YA GAME UP!
UGH!
