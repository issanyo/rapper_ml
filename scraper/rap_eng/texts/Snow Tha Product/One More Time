Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
You dipped on me knowing that my life wasn't alright
You tripped on me every time when I was on my grind
I was out here working, product trafficin' and all night
I was tryna make it work wit' you but you a liar
And you made me waste time
Rolling round with these fake guys
Gossiping on they break time
You believe them, then say bye
Don't-Don't-Don't trip when I roll up with an ex
One thing I [?]
I'ma show you why you shouldn't of left
I'ma come up in this bitch and I'ma blow a bigger cheque
Oh bitch I'm stuntin' on you, I'm stuntin' on you (on you)
Oh what the fuck you gon' do?
What the fuck you gon' do? Not shit!
When I pull up in the brand new whip
And you don't remember me to act like this
Bitch brand new wagon, brand new new crib
New attitude, now new text who's this?

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind

[Verse 2: AJ Hernz]
Ooo
Fuck all that shit you tell me
I'ma dip out, I'm ready
Talking that shit, I'm petty
Me and my dogs stay lit
See you been tryna-you been tryna call like I ain't hitting no twice
I'ma stunt so hard and hit the club every night
Tell you what it's feeling like
I've been on the road tonight
I know that I'm gone
And now you all alone
Ain't no way to make this right
I'm up at a different height
You cannot keep up with me, yeah
I ain't gon' let you come and go and waste my time
You know exactly how I feel, can't change my mind
And I ain't the one yeah, I'm in my 2-3 zone yeah
4-5 like Jordan, you used to be important

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind
So fuck all that shit you tell me
Bite my cake like Debbie
Whether or not they let me
I'ma wild out like they did me
I'ma-I'ma call my girls and hit that club one more time
I'ma stunt so hard and say you never on my mind
