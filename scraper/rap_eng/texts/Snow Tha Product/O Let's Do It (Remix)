(Run up or shut up, ya bitch)
Snow White
Look, yo

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
I step up in this bitch
Guess who showed up with some product pushers
I suggest you sit
Got held back before I get two shots pucket
Get your ass wock or flock, said stupid
Trying to come up my block, took him
For everything you get shooken
Cause around here it is going down like Snooki
Get the hell back or get your shit took
By a mean ass team but you ain't getting no love
How the fuck else you think that
I walked in with 25 guys in this club
[?]
Taking orders from a short ass chick
That still don't give a fuck (That's me)
You just bought the bar and this night is getting hectic
Leaving Texas, DF'ed the VIP section
Exit if drinking and smoking ain't on your checklist
Cause we got that fire and your bitch like 'Purple take this'

[Hookx2]
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence

[Verse 2: Waka Flocka Flame]
One shot, man down, his brains go "ka-pow!"
Ow, that shit hurt, so don't fuck around
But that happen often off in Riverdale, Georgia
You gonna pay the life you live off in Riverdale, Georgia
They gonna lay your ass out, rock you to sleep like a baby
Hit Squad, shawty, in the hood we got them babies
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy

[Hook]
Yeah! Oh let's do it
Oh let's do it, oh let's do it
Yeah! Drug dealing music
I influence, I influence
