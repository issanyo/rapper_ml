[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
I’m back at it like Booyah
Like how I do ya
You see you need a mami chula
Get a hallelujah
I’m working on myself
And trying not to get lit too much
But then I get two cups
And get to sippin’, thinkin' different
Cause I never drink enough
And you look like
The party type
And got your body right
You lookin’ at the fact that I am all of that
I’m honest that we book the back
For everyone here to have fun: Yes
I’m from the bay we go dumb: Yes
Who here can twerk in a sun-dress
Could be drunk love or it’s drunk
Yes you and your friends can get into VIP
You bought a bottle and you kept it hidden, said it’s for me
I like to drink and do a show and kill it
And I can see you from the stage
All I can say is uhh we about to leave

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
I know you see me tryin’ to get that. (Mmm)
Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)
I’ll have you saying Oooo you did that. (Mmm)
But I got some friends, so where your friends at. (Mmm)
I know you see me tryin’ to get that. (Mmm)
Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)
I’ll have you saying Oooo you did that. (Mmm)
But I got some friends, so where your friends at. (Mmm)

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
Man I’m lookin’ for the baddest, somebody show me
And bring another for the homies, for Lex and Snowy
I'll get you lit just like a stogie, get it in like Kobe
I’m getting cheese no macaroni, so get to know me
And yeah I’m trying to go and get that
Tell me if you with that
This that, shit that, makes my last bitch call and try to kick back
Since that didn’t work, just go on and let me hit that
Pick back up where we was at like where the drink at
What you want baby, what you want
Don’t compare me to your mans, he can’t give you what I got
He ain’t fuckin’ with me man you better tell that boy to stop
I ain’t tryin to cuff you either, I’ma leave that to the cops
Emmm, meet me right after the show uhh
Yeah, ain’t nobody gotta know uhh
Yeah, and I‘m gone off that patron
I ain’t trying to cop your number I’m just trying to take you home

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]
I know you see me tryin’ to get that. (Mmm)
Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)
I’ll have you saying Oooo you did that. (Mmm)
But I got some friends, so where your friends at. (Mmm)
I know you see me tryin’ to get that. (Mmm)
Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)
I’ll have you saying Oooo you did that. (Mmm)

[Verse 3: LexTheGreat]
We can kick it if you wanna
Backstage we got some marijuana
It’s a vibe know that we ain’t with the drama
Bring your friends, I got mine, we got the bottles
Party all night fuck tomorrow
I’m ya sancho
Don’t get in your feelings, it’s no strings attached
You say you like being rachet and also keep it classy
No regrets when you lit, fuck the aftermath
Every day I do it big like it was my last
Girl you know I’m tryna to get that
You’re bad and boujee and you know I really dig that
Bounce up on me one time let me see that
Oh you playin’ shy now I don’t believe that

[Chorus: Snow Tha Product]

Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)

But I got some friends, so where your friends at. (Mmm)
I know you see me tryin’ to get that. (Mmm)
Backstage we can kick back. (Mmm)
I’ll have you saying Oooo you did that. (Mmm)
But I got some friends, so where your friends at. (Mmm)
