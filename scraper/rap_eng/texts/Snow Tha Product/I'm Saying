[Bridge]
I might pour some drink up on the low (I'm drinking now)
I might pop a bar up on the low (I'm saying now)
I might get fucked up until I'm gone (I'm faded)
Why the fuck y'all care 'bout what I'm on?

[Pre-Hook]
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)
They try to say I got a problem
I cut them bitches off (You know I cut them bitches off)

[Hook]
So what if I stay faded
Stay faded, stay faded, stay faded
I know it's wrong
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it, don't say it
I got control
Cause what the fuck you've done for me to talk about my life?
I've being doing too many wrongs, ain't might just make a right

[Verse 1]
Aye look
Everybody wanna talk shit
How all of a sudden everybody got opinions about a bitch
Now they wanna tell me how it is
Kinda funny, pretty sure I'm sure you still be chillin' at the crib
You ain't put in work as hard as this
I've been putting work in while you hoes been sleeping in
Now I'm off touring, bitches wanna say some shit
Yeah you've got your two cents but bitch you need to get a grip
Shit

[Pre-Bridge]
I'm drinking now
I'm saying now
I'm drinking now
I'm saying

Stay faded, stay faded, stay faded
