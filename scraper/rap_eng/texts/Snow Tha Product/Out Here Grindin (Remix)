[Hook: Akon]
I don't care what nobody say
Imma be me (be me)
Stay hood, stay rasied in the streets
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
Niggas talk about greatness whenever they speak about me (Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't splitting nothing with nobody homie
I gotta give me me
(Cause I'm out here grindin')
I ain't slept in 8 days
I can go for 8 weeks
Ain't nothing to me cause I am the streets

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
[?] hating, but its typical now
But like a gumball, im sticking around
Im getting it now, lyrics by the pound
Money really talks, my figures is loud
Im making an entrance, fashionably late
Blew out the candles, made a wish, and then bit in the cake
Ive been making what the couldn't even if they payed
[?]
Ghost write for racks, i'll ghost write your tracks
I'll keep it on the shush, i'll bet you're coming back
Snowhite the [?] relax, no baby never that
The album coming soon, this mixtape just a jab
I got em thinking fast, but still react slow
Its me to blame, dont go crazy its irrational
Im out here grinding hard, so bitch keep up
Theres only one reaction when i rap: "Jesus!"
