Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
(Yo, look)
Pull up in the Audi with a baddie
Got a little bit of liquor but I got a brick in the trunk
Bitch look and sound like aggy
Voice a little raspy 'cause she been hittin' the blunt
Trill ass bitch this isn't a front
Big on IG but the bitch in the cut
Used to pop Xan 'til she fidget a bunch
Gave her fidget spinner that she spin on her thumb
Now we lit in the club, Pibb is a must
Only bring your girl if she thick in the butt
Eyes a little low, pill, hit and I'm numb
Tryna be lowkey, ho get to the front
Bitch I got haters all over the place
'Cause I'm out waiting on slow to the race
Yes I do get mine, let a bitch get by
Winnin' on this side, roll with the babe

(Uh, uh, yup, right) Uh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yup, yup, right)
Yeah, yeah, huh (Uhm, right)
Got! Got! Got got got got! (Uh, right)

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
Yeah, yeah
Pull up in a Lexus, just came from Texas
Yeah, she with me for the night
Stackin' like Tetris, flex on ya exes
Yeah, I'll be doin' ya right
Swang in a whip then I swerve to the right
Pour me a drink when we stop at the light
Make sure it's Henny and it's light on the ice
Since you got a lot of cake, tryin' to cut me a slice
Yeah, so I'm gone again
Stay doin' funk to my song again
Hooked, now she wanna ride along again
Now I bet that she won't ever say I'm wrong again, ooh
They don't like me but she do, ooh
Never ride without the tool, ooh
Give a fuck if you like me you still tryin' to bite me
I'd do that too if I was you, ooh

(Mm, yeah, uh, right)
(Uh, yeah, right)
(Yeah, uh, right)
(Huh, right)

[Verse 3: LexTheGreat]
Yeah
I don't got a whip but the bitch hit me up
In yo Hyundai Elantra ya got in a fight (fight!)
Tryna be lowkey 'cause bitch nosy
Drove fast, slow creep and got off at the light
Oh shoot, we just seen her man driving by (skrrt!)
Saw me, goddamn, we both bout to fight (aah!)
He swung so I punched him back in the eye
Now he laid out, give him props 'cause he tried (Oh god!)
Yeah, now I'm at her crib
She said "Fuck him, he a little bitch" (Fuck!)
If they ain't mind then I don't trip
No holdin' I go all in (That's right!)
Take no L's, just takin' wins (yuh!)
High off weed and lots of gin (Woo!)
So much, we gon' need oxygen (Yuh!)
Steady countin' Benjamins (Woo, woo, woo!)

(Yuh, uh, yuh, right)

[Verse 4: AJ Hernz]
Pull up in the Lyft with your bitch
And she paid for the trip
I might get lucky tonight
I cannot function if it's not a vibe
I fuck wit' you like I fuck with my rice
Ayy, Mexicana from the way (yeah!)
I'm just tryna pave the way (yeah!)
We ain't bouta gettin play (yeah!)

I-I-I-I can turn it on like a light switch, yeah
I can beat it up like I'm Tyson, yeah
G-get you ringside like a bad bitch, yeah
Get your tits fixed, Kardashian, yeah

Ice in my vein no I can't miss
Makin' it flip like gymnastics
Miss me with that fake shit
Hoggin' the lane while the paint drip

(Yeah, ay, huh, right)
(Yeah, ay, right)
(Uh, whoa, right)
(Hey, whoa, right)
