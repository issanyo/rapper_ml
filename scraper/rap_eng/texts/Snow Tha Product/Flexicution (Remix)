I be like ayy dios
I been woke even wit my eyes closed
Diles q sin quieren mas
Mira que esto va pa largo
Tiren barrio
Ride slow
Live fast better get that cash flo
Anybody wanna stand in my way i got people yellin whoop that ass snow
Snow Tha Product got fed up wit the shit
Life already hard enough as it is
I dont need these muthafuckas shadin me or talkin' shit about where the fuck i am
I been out here gettin cash on my own
Travel the country headlinin my shows
I ain't askin anybody for favors
You muthafuckers wanna hate on ms. snow
Man tell me bout it
I know how you feel about me
Lyrically i can threaten anybody's fuckin career
How you feel about it
Since we're being honest
I can give it all up
Have a couple babies when they learn to talk then they will spit some bars and
I can guarantee you that it's fire somewhere in they first verse they will say you garbage
Ima muthafuckin problem
Forreal
Money talks im talkin a mill
Mac is out don't gotta conceal
Mac is out don't gotta conceal
Top 5 I'm top 2
Talkn' spittn' bars n that grind too
Ya'll childs play like caiou
N by the way that was a haiku
Look
Goddamit Atlantic better get it together before strange hit em wit the tech
Slept on so long, got kink in my neck
I been thinkin it's best we relinquish the debt
Got it all in cash or I can write a check
Or ya'll could buy me lunch or yall can gimme desk n let me write for rappers yall do give press
I feel like Piper Chapman how much time is left cuz goddamn
