[Hook]
Now I'm on the phone talkin' with you
Cause I'm drunk and I miss you
And I know we have issues
But I called to say "What's up" and "What you doin'?"
"Who you there with?"
"Would you like me to come over
And remind you why we fell in drunk love?"

[Verse 1]
Okay we had a fight, so what?
Don't act like you never done me wrong, hold up
So I got mad and I called the tow truck
And it ended up costin' you 454 bucks
But, umm, you should of never yelled like that
And you know me, you know that I'll be yellin' right back
You know what I'm about and you know where my mind's at
And if you gonna disrespect me, then I'm gonna fight back
But anyway, yes I hit the club
And anyway, yes I did get buzzed
And anyway, yes I thought about stuff
And I realized I think I'm a little messed up
Cause I drank 5 shots, cause my girls said "eff him,"
"Girl you don't need him if he gon' be disrespectin"
"Girl you did right and I hope he learned his lesson"
I'm like "Yeah! Wait a second... "

[Verse 2]
Okay, don't hang up
I know we do this a lot, but wait up
I thought about it, and I don't wanna break up
And I was thinkin' maybe I can stop by later
And I can make you feel the same way
Cause I know you got me feelin' crazy
And you got me back and forth and my last resort is to drink and that just ain't me
And I know we argue
And I been trying not to call you
And it's been roller-coaster ride, and it got a lot worse when you walked in to the club and I saw you
So now I'm back to this, after I've been drinkin'
Back to you and I'm losin' my inhibitions
Maybe I shouldn't have called it like this, but I'm drunk and I been thinkin'...

[Bridge x2]
I'm in this punch drunk love
So I had to call so I could say "What's up? "
I'm trying to figure out if we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)
If we can chill (if we can chill)

[Outro]
Punch drunk love...
Punch drunk love...
Punch drunk love...
