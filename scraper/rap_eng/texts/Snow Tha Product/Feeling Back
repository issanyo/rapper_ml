[Verse 1]
She could have hella money, hundred stack
Gucci, Loui, Prada and a Birkin bag
She could have Tig ol' bitties, big ol' ass
Still won't guarantee you that you're gonna last
Just like I could find a man, with a 5 year plan
Get a job and a crib and a some plans with about two kids me
Yell at him to get my bills payed
And give me everything, I want it in my pay

[Hook]
I've been looking for someone to get my feelings back
I want my feelings back, I just want my feelings back
You can keep on looking for someone to get the feeling back
You want that feeling back, I know you want that feeling back
Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Feeling back, feeling back
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer

[Verse 2]
What'd you thought you could get?
Get a lil' thought real quick
Make the bottle pop with a little [?]
Get a pop and you're not gon' trip
When you find out that it ain't about the bitch
I don't know how real this is about to get
So just act clown, but I know you was out here with
A couple dumb hoes that still watching this
Cause the shit you felt when I was there was real there's no denying that
Your pride in the way, that's why you stay lurking where I be at
When the, who the, what the fuck you doing baby, why you act?
He like, "That your ex?", ooh I know I be mad!
Cause I get me a man with that car that you like
And I popped me a Xan and he gave me the ooh
And I felt aw damn it doesn't feel right so I mess with my best friend, she was alright
But they never been about that though
This shit is all about us
At the end of the day, we were never the same
And you know i'm right

[Hook]
I've been looking for someone to get my feelings back
I want my feelings back, I just want my feelings back
You can keep on looking for someone to get the feeling back
You want that feeling back, I know you want that feeling back
Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Feeling back, feeling back
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Feeling back, feeling back

I know you want that feeling back
Cause ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Feeling back, feeling back
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Ain't nobody gonna get you realer
Feeling back, feeling back
