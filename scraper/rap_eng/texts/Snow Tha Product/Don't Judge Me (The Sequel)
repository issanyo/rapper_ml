Verse 1: Drxga
Pickin em up
Fuckin em up
My flow, that's what’s up
My flow so wet, when I pull up to the crib, pump her full of kids, yeah
I don't wanna be judged so don't judge me
Imma jury now so don’t push me
Imma execute the clowns so don't get too mushy
My flow full of fury, murky for certain, i'm lurking
Waiting to murder an instrumental, boy that is for certain
I'm cursin' and hurtin', dispersin' rhymes through the curtain
I only think of you when i am lonely and sober
But now the curtains are closing, go home, homie the show is over
The locomotive, motive, motorboating, hocus pocus

Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign
Please don't judge me
No, please don’t say you love me
(I’m young and I'm dumb and I’m turning up
Turning up turning up
Please don't judge me
No, please don't say you love me
(I'm young and I’m dumb and I'm turning up
Turning up turning up

Verse 2: Drxga
The locomotive, motive, motorboating, hocus pocus, goosebumps, dr who and dr strange had a orgy party
The ruckus, erupted, resurrected the muppets, and then I killed em all again, yeah hoe that's the ruckus
A giant fall from grace, eleven stories, face
Planted into the sidewalk, tightrope walk, on the bean stalk
I have these thoughts, more then once, bitch I mean't it when I said i loved you more then once, for shizzle, cos whore we're done, after all we've done, keep talkin' shit, hoe, i'm gonna shoot you more then once, i'm bored with sluts, I've been through this more then once, ya'll hoes be the boredom sluts, yeah

Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign
Please don't judge me

Turning up turning up
Please don't judge me
No, please don't say you love me
(I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up
Turning up turning up

Verse 3: Snow Tha Product
Light skinned long hair señorita, rolling up sativa
Finally in the lime light, slice limes and tequila
Living like can you keep up, I'm on the beach in Rosarito
Yup I got my feet up, you wanna see then pull a seat up
Cause we bout to eat good, we been working for the past years
Life's about to have to pay me back for the past tears
Passing cashiers all of my Visa cards
I hand my momma hella bags and tell her these are yours
Now we afford to buy cause of my weeks of tours
Are having to finally pay me back cause yes I need couture
Now I need you boys to know you can keep the whores
Cause I ain't looking for a man, I make G's galore

Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign
Please don't judge me
No, please don't say you love me
(I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up
Turning up turning up
Please don't judge me
No, please don't say you love me
(I'm young and I'm dumb and I'm turning up
Turning up turning up

Verse 4: Snow Tha Product

Cause I'm bout to make it, about to take it to the majors
Man I'm tired of playing, I'm tired of having to being patient
We bout to eat good no more struggling now
We buzzing in town, my cousin and my brother been down
To run for the crown, we about to make em woke if they sleeping
Coming for y'all, we bout to make a toast to the weekend
Cause I got me a check with my name on top

Cause the turn up don't stop yea it don't stop tell em

Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign
