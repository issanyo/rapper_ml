[Pre-Chorus: W. Darling]
Right here face to face in your sheets
We're tucked underneath all these city street lights
Where everything starts with your kiss
Didn't I do it all for the nights like this
So I...

[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
What's a little liquor to a cold heart?
What's a little pill but a little number feeling now
It can never end if it don't start
You can never do it all, if you are never willing uh
Hold up I think my phone vibratin'
Slow up I think the whole world hatin'
Came up and now the whole view changin'
I've been up on game, I've just been waiting
What's a little change to a pocket full?
What's a little party when the work already done
You got that drink up in your system and it's audible
Words are getting slurred and now your vision kinda trippin'
If it's vibes you want then it's vibes you get
What you want, baby I'll do that
Glad you chose to be my new friend
What you tryna be and what's next?

[Pre-Chorus: W. Darling]
Right here face to face in your sheets
We're tucked underneath all these city street lights
Where everything starts with your kiss
Didn't I do it all for the nights like this

[Chorus: W. Darling]
Then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like...

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
What's a little liquor when you're feeling uncomfortable
What's a little high when you've been feeling so fuckin' low
Cause I've done told you
If it's vibes you want then it's vibes you get
I've been on you since I walked in
I can tell that you wanna come with me, what's poppin' then?
Don't gotta tell me 'bout your past, tell me 'bout your future
Got me feelin' sleepy, I've been fuckin' with them two cups
You done did it, I've been with it
Henny in your glass and you're babysitting, kill it
It ain't really nothin' but I'm on, yeah
You know latin girls and that Patron
And oh my god I'm talkin
Wonder if you've got someone at home, yeah
I know how it go when I'm on tour and got me watchin'
If it's vibes you want then it's vibes, yeah
We can go and hit the valet park, yeah
All I'm tryna do is get home and get comfortable

[Bridge]
When the light is so bright
You get a little bit
Little bit blinded
When you're lifted so high
You falling feels like flying
When you're lost in those eyes
Feels like you might be gone forever
So, one last kiss

[Chorus: W. Darling]
Then let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
(On a night like)
On a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this
(On a night like)
Now let it end on a night like this
On a night like this
On a night like this

[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]
Baby I could change your life, that's if you let me, yeah
I could let you spend the night, that's off the record
What you say, what you say, what you say?
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name?
Baby I could change your life, that's if you let me, yeah
I could let you spend the night, that's off the record
What you say, what you say, what you say?
What's your name, what's your name, what's your name?

[Outro: Snow Tha Product]
It ain't really nothin' but I'm on, yeah
You know latin girls and that Patron
And oh my god I'm talkin
Wonder if you've got someone at home, yeah
I know how it go when I'm on tour and got me watchin'
