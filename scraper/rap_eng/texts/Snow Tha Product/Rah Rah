[Hook: Jandro]
People like me, stay up
In my bed, I can't sleep 'cause I'm woke
People like me, play fair
Stay true, to my word 'cause I'm woke
People like me, square up
Fuck guns, run ones run up
People like me
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all

[Verse 1: Jandro]
I'm a savvy dude, I never mix my business with my pleasure
X all my competition, had no problem hunting treasure
Short fuse, and I swear I got a midget temper
[?] so just watch me sever
I know I move in silence, got 'em all baffled
Watch me pop off then give back like a charity raffle
Before I break my loyalty, I'll choose to break my bones
I don't affiliate myself with snakes like Indiana Jones
And please don't ever get me mixed with anybody else
I'm moving [?], pockets need to be obese like fucking [?]
And if you ask me where I'm headed then I'm pointing up
I use the heavens as my starting point, and that's my [?]

[Hook: Jandro]
People like me, stay up
In my bed, I can't sleep 'cause I'm woke
People like me, play fair
Stay true, to my word 'cause I'm woke
People like me, square up
Fuck guns, run ones run up
People like me
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Yo
People like me say fuck clout, fuck y'all
All I got is my word
People like you gon' duck out when I bust out all these facts
And feelings get hurt
People like you, shit
People like you ain't allowed around me
Better get from 'round me before I leave
I don't got an ounce of coward in me
People like you, the type to talk behind backs
'Cause all you do is front
People like me, start a business then run this shit
All you do is run
Tryna find common ground, but it's none
You a little bitch, a pussy and punk
Supposed to be a man, but you a bigger bitch than a bitch
Like sis, you got me fucked up
Look, you the type to bite the hand that feeds you
I'm the type to fucking split my plate
You can count my pockets, go and copy what I did
But don't forget bitch, we are not the fucking same yeah, yeah

[Hook: Jandro]
People like me, stay up
In my bed, I can't sleep 'cause I'm woke
People like me, play fair
Stay true, to my word 'cause I'm woke
People like me, square up
Fuck guns, run ones run up
People like me
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all
We just don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck at all
