[Verse 1: Snow Tha Product]
Got my ex callin'
Got my new one stallin'
Jobs ain't calling back
I got my back against the wall (and)
Everybody in my life lackin'
While I been all in
I've been here back and forth in traffic boy I be mobbin'
I've been tryin' to get the bag
I've been all in this job (and)
Bitch if you knew I work this hard then why all the talkin'
I've been chasing all this
Cashing these deposits
Trying to make an option
For me and my partners
So when I look back and I hear bitches with the talking
Why the fuck wouldn't I approach you haters with some caution
I got so much drama can't explain right now
But you wouldn't know it I've been on my wave right now, ayo

[Chorus]
What you say? (Oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway
They better off falling back (Falling back)
Falling back (oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 2: Castro Escobar]
Ay, Ay
I don't really care 'bout what they say
I've been having tunnel vision sippin' everyday
Too much going on
On the phone right now
Got these bitches in my business
But I'm gone right now (Ay, yeah)
I don't need that type of vibe
Keep a baddie on the side
Best believe she lookin' fine
Pop a pill, tryna leave
Yeah I do this all the time
I ain't wanna deal with nothin'
So I left it all behind and I
Went to the bar (Ay)
Whippin' the car (Ay)
3 in the morning
I'm swanging and swerving all up in the lot (Ay)
Yeah, said I'm gone right now
I'm just really tryna be alone right now, ayo

[Chorus]
What you say? (Oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway
They better off falling back (Falling back)
Falling back (oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway

[Verse 3: LexTheGreat]
Yeah
Lately I been feeling like this shit ain't working out
And lately I've been drinking, I been slumped down swear to god
Fuck all that bullshit that y'all be sayin'
I know I gotta leave and do my thang
I'ma pour it up, roll a blunt
Pop a bar in, slow it up
Keep the drama off my phone right now
I don't give a fuck, I'm in my zone right now
Yeah

[Chorus]
What you say? (Oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway
They better off falling back (Falling back)
Falling back (oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)
I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway

[Bridge: Snow Tha Product]
They better off falling back

[Chorus]
What you say? (Oh)
I've been out here vibin' higher and I ain't gon' fall (yeah)

They better off falling back (Falling back)
Falling back (oh)

I could give a fuck 'bout what they say
Yeah, it doesn't matter anyway
