Pum-Pumbaa are you nuts?

[Verse 1]
I don't know when you thought that this shit wasn't worth prioritizing or at least
Givin' my ass a heads up so I could continue with the way I used to be
I don't know when you changed it up on me, but I could've swore I never got the text
I could've planned this shit accordingly, I hate to nag and I hate to stress
Cause I haven't been up on my regular shit, man I was slowin' down a little to pursue this
I ain't a regular bitch, and if I wanted to unblock a couple numbers we could do this
But I heard that ain't how you get your man back, bring back my wild and ratchet ass back
Back to the nights I'd open my tab like Henny's on tap
You know you hate that, so hey
Anything you gotta say now, probably gonna be the time to say it
Hmm
I would like a fuckin' breakdown, when were you planning on fuckin' telling me
That ever since we started talking you been on your jealousy
But in the meanwhile you been talking to Penelope and Heather and Alicia and Stephanie and Melanie
And phone lookin' like a Petey Pablo song, offendin' me
And now I'm like

[Pre-Chorus]
Getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone

Getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone

[Chorus]
Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time, time, time
A fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time

[Verse 2]
I don't know when you thought that it would be appropriate to give my ass a little warning
That's annoying, right
Asking for the fucking food I ordered
I mean yes I'm too much 'cause I know that I'm tough and I'm not the submissive type
And I know that it's rough 'cause I made a few bucks and I stress 'cause the business tight
But that don't mean you get a pass to be hitting up Jasmine 'cause she got fired and she need a friend
She was in your class in math like way the fuck back like, what am I an idiot?
'Cause I been known the code to your phone, but I don't wanna go in it because I already know what I'ma find
I been seeing too much and I throw it to the side
Turned a blind eye at some point you're just blind uh huh
Oh you think I ain't seen that? Uh huh
Oh I shouldn't have to keep tabs? Uh huh
Maybe you shouldn't have led me on, I was thinking this whole time that we had something going strong uh huh
Oh I guess it's all in my head uh huh
Switch up to get in my bed uh huh
Funny only you have friends, but you check my DMs checking hearts that get sent like

[Pre-Chorus]
Getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone

Getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone

Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time, time, time
A fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time

[Bridge]
I been waiting for you
I been waiting for you
Let's stop fucking bullshitting, what the fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
No getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone

Getting attached
I'm gonna go
I'll be alright
I'm better alone


[Chorus]
Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
Cause you're a fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time, time, time
A fuckin' waste of time
A fuckin' waste of time
