Work
Work for it, work for it
Show me how you do it when somebody tryna pay for it
Work

[Verse 1 –  ?]
I said, baby quit playing, go and work, work
Let me bang it like my turf, I be the flyest nigga on earth, earth
YSL on my shirt
Louis V on my jeans, couple bad bitches my team
I love the way you move it, you got me drooling
That ass so stupid, whole crew gonna wanna do it
[?] no puedes controlar

And the way you pop it, you got it popping
It’s a knockout how you’re dropping, now can’t nobody stop it
[?] mi, solo para mi
[?] cama [?] mi

[Bridge – Ray J]
You working all night, you must be on the grave shift
You working all night, taking off like a spaceship

[Verse 2 – Payso B]
I said baby quit playing, go and work
Like you hot up on the spot
Work it like you up on the clock, clock
I could take you to the top, I could take you to the scene
Living life like you’re in a dream

[Verse 3 – Snow Tha Product]
He telling me to work for it, but I’m somebody you got to deserve to get
He like why don’t you twerk a bit
Cause I’m a pimp, I got game like a tournament
You say you love me like Rico
Tryna come with my PO
Said he loving my Cee-Lo cause little mama’s neck is on frio
I’m like all the bad bitches to the front
Throwing racks at em, they gon give us what we want
Stunting in the club, grabbed a couple stacks of ones
Are you working or are you working
She just tryna make some funds, that’s what’s up
Look I’m like paper, we got that

No chasers, where the shots at
Oh it’s bottles up, well I’ll pop that
Cause I gots that so it’s [?]
