[Intro]
Uhh, uhh
Uhh, yo

[Verse]
This ain't for bitches that want the tea
This for boss bitches that got the juice
I shouldn't have to tell you again
Bitch you ain't woke then we end your snooze
I don't be jumping from crew to crew
I don't be clubbin', lookin' for booze
I only go out if it's my tables
I don't need friends, bitch I pick and choose

And bitches talk out their neck but don't pop off
Get a little taste, finna make your jaw drop
Like hot sauce; y'all broads all talk, y'all know y'all fraud ass bootlegs, rip offs and knock offs
Sit down and walk off
Get out and watch our shit on the top blog
Been on the chop block
Y-y'all really pullin' no numbers, I guess the call blocked
Y'all been out here ridin' my jock and I get a top off

M-m
Bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch
I'ma tell you like this, this, this, this, this
I'ma need you to get, get, get, get, get-
Off my whole crew's dick, dick, dick, dick, dick
You gone figure out thiiissss (this)-
Whole thing can geettt (get)-
Real out of hand and bitch I'm thiinnk (think)-
Ing you should quiittt (quit)
'fore I get scandalous like Uhh

B-b-bitches in the game want beef
I would reconsider if it's aimed at me
Like Uhh
There ain't nowhere safe I see
You gone have to pray 'bout me
Hold 'em up like Uhh
Somethin' bout to make y'all weak
Somethin' in the air y'all breathe
I'ma hit ya like Uhh
Fuck around, fuck around, fuck around, fuck around, get y'all beat
Uhh, uhh, uhh

Shark up in the water
B-bitches in my way
I-I-I been on my own shit
Now they want my lane
Bi-bi-bi-Bitches tryna jack me
Satan, not today
Not if I can help this shit, I went through hell for this, it means y'all PRAY! Uhh
