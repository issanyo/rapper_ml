[Verse 1]
When they play my song, they gonna run it back
And when you see me then you knowing where the party at
Career went, full circle like a cul de sac
To all my high-school haters I’ve been heart attacks
Cause boy I come through, riding on a brontosaurus
And I drink a little liquor cause I’m out here touring
Pass out, so drunk, motherfuckers snoring
Bitches mouth stay running so I call em forest
Cause we got fucked up, girls roll the tourist
You would think by now we would act mature
But fuck that, yup yap in a bitch it’s portion
I don’t never give apology I act according
To the shots I took and the lines you snorted
I find myself funny but I find you worrying
Now catch myself running to a flight that’s boarding

[Hook]
But hey, good nights and bad mornings
But hey, good nights and bad mornings
Hey, good nights and bad mornings
Mornin, mornin, mornin, mornin


[Verse 2]
Let’s get drunk, so we can’t get blamed for shit
Take hella shots till we get the hang of it
A bunch of free bottles, ain’t no sense in wasting it
We be drinking hela Hennessy and blazing it
With hella white boys like Josh n Drake and shit
See this is what you living like when you be making it
Some people like you and some people be fake and shit
But free weed mean free blunts to the face again
I’m going outta this world and I’m back in orbit
I be getting lifted and the weed’s my forklift
We got hella substance and you can’t control it
I be spitting hella game cause I never forfeit
I be spilling hela beer on my fucking Jordans
Woke up with a mess that I can’t afford it
My camera man hovered and he still recording
Go ahead, get this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let’s make a bong out of water bottle
Cause I ain’t bring a pipe but I brought pot though
And the drugs in my rooms I feel like a capo
We in Tejas, but I’ma start a sideshow
Attention all you haters, get upon your job though
I been making money and I’m like "Que paso?"
You supposed to be stopping it but I guess you not so
Good at what you doing cause I’m getting Mars dough
I’ma drive to Tijuana just to buy some tacos
Cause I’m on every color and I got the passport
I got my reggie wanna but you walking out mode
Cause you hella fried so of course we not close
Me and my game tight like a fucking corset
We get drunk together and we hit them stores then
We can buy whatever, cause no money shortage
Now we have to pay for luggage when our flight is boarding
But hey, good nights and bad mornings
