[Hook x2]
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
I'm a good girl in a bad world I ain't safe in

[Verse 1]
Look, O'm gonna do this like a girl that needs to take control
So he don't gotta worry bout how low Ms.Snow can go
Just know that i can do any and everything and know
I'm Snow Tha Product, I put-I put-I put on the show
I got these chicks that wanna copy cause they know they talkin' about me
Boys ask me to call them papi, I say no boy get up off me
I pull up on paparazzi, wanna take some shots of mami
Strutting through the club and then I ride it like a Maserati
[?] got them intoxicated drunk
Popping and rocking got me ridiculously crunk
They hollering mami, got them excited, I'm like "Uh"
Too busy I'm like "Yooo"
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
I'm a good girl in a bad world I ain't safe in
So Imma be a good girl, I'm all about that cake because revenge is so sweet, and i can tell you how it tastes

[Hook x2]
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
Good girls shake it, bad girls get naked
I'm a good girl in a bad world I ain't safe in
