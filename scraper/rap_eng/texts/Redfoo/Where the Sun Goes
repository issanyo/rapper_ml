[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Lady, I've been watching you
Ooh, baby, I know you've been watching me, too
You're the type of girl
In demand and loves to dance
To make the boys go insane
If you're the type of girl
Drink in hand and loves the sand
Then baby I'm your man

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Let me take you where the sun goes
I can make your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby, we can leave our shadows behind
(Let Stevie get something now)

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
Baby, like animals in the wild
We could play all day and all night
Underneath the stars
And I'm the type of girl
In demand and loves to dance
To make the boys go insane
Yeah, yeah, I'm the type of girl
(Drink in hand and loves the sand)
So, baby, take me by the hand

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Let me take you where the sun goes
I can make your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby, we can leave our shadows behind

[Post-Chorus: Redfoo]
Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind
Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Yo, yo, let's go now
Now, beep, beep, beep beep
Guess who's rolling in the snowed out Jeep
On fleek, got next seat
If you wanna roll with me and be free
Ooh wee, let the games begin
Turn up, volume on 10
What a feeling, no ceiling
Hands up, hair blowing in the wind, uh
Two villains on the run
Yeah, two kids following the sun
Footprints in the sand, skipping rocks
Holding hands, knee deep in the white wash
It's getting late but we ain't done yet
To the Coast Guard, take our postcard by the sunset
Me and you sipping Malibu with a view

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Let me take you where the sun goes
I can make your fantasies come to life
Wherever the sun goes
Baby, we can leave our shadows behind

[Post-Chorus: Redfoo]
Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind
Whoa-oh, leave our shadows behind

[Outro: Redfoo]
(Sun goes, sun goes)
I'm gonna take you where the sun goes
(Sun goes, sun goes)
I'm gonna take you where the sun goes
