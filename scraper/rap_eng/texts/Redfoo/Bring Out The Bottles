[Verse 1]
I’m walkin' in the club with my hands up high tonight
On the dancefloor the girlies is lookin' fly
Yeah, It’s gonna be poppin’ tonight

The DJ plays the record and it makes the club go high
I’m ballin' in the VIP with my clique real 4th of july

[Chorus]

It’s gonna be poppin’ tonight
It’s gon’, it’s gonna be poppin’

Everyday we gonna get, everyday we gonna get, yeah !
And there ain’t no stoppin'
Shake that girl, keep the bottles poppin’
If I take that girl, then the panites droppin'
But I'll wait right here cause I see more options
I got it, hey
And now you want it, oh
And then you need it, hey
Because I beat it
Up, up, up make you scream for more
I drink so much gotta hit the floor
She dropped it low, I slapped it yo
And said it's Redfoo with the big ass-fro

[Interlude]
In her ear said :
It’s gonna be poppin’ tonight
It's gon', it's gonna be Poppin'
In the club I said :
The champagne’s poppin’ tonight

[Chorus]
Bring out the bottles, oh

It’s a celebration
