[Intro]
She broke my heart right from the start

[Verse 1]
This girl has taken me over
Like a Jedi, she's a mind controller
She gave me some, now I need a little more, yeah
She's the only one to make me scream and shout
Watch me

[Hook]
Lights out
Ooh, I'm dead
Lights out
Like a bullet to the head
Lights out
Look here, girl, just let me in your bed
Lights out
I'll be the only one to make you scream and shout
Lights out

[Post-Hook]
Watch me
I'm lights out

[Verse 1]
This girl has taken me over
Like a Jedi, she's a mind controller
She gave me some, now I need a little more, yeah
She's the only one to make me scream and shout
Watch me
I'm lights out

[Verse 2]
Yo, this girl cray
One minute she love me, the next she hates
She reminds me of Houdini the Great
I think I got her on lock, then she escapes
One hit got daddy wondering
Stop the sugar, stop funding him
Goddamn it, I'm in a conundrum
But when I see that bum bum bum bum bum bum
She knows that I made her my #1
Everywhere she goes, I'm on the run
She's got my nose all sprung
Lights out

[Post-Hook]
Watch me
I'm lights out
