[Hook: Redfoo]
It doesn't matter what I say, no matter what I do
Every little thing reminds me of you
It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
Every little thing reminds me of you

[Bridge]
Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you (4x)

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Yes, party people, we drop and feet go
To make your fist-pump, hands up and feet go
Crazy, look at all these ladies, tonight is going down
Going down, Mayday!
We party rocking' in this place for sho'
Every place that we walk in is the place to go
Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week
Sexy go-gos the way your booty bobbles to the beat it's like:
On and popping, ain't no stopping, that bass is knocking
Them shots are dropping, some of us came to celebrate
But most of us came to get away

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sky Blu]
I'm a heavyweight
Light on my feet, watch me levitate
Sex tape, watch me penetrate
Then I slap you in the ass let it resonate
I'm living with the finer things
Designer draws, and diamond rings
Go to the mall, lots of things
I stay the same, call it pocket change, nigga (Pocket change, nigga)
I never ever been a bitch, my last girl was, so player had to switch
Probably only with me cause I'm rich, now she only on my booty call list
Yeah, mo money don't stop the show
But she still can ride my banana boat
She still can ride my banana boat
Now her new nick name is banana throat
Clear it out
I'm the one everybody here about, man you're just here for now
So simmer down, Verizon flow, you hear me now
I'm always up to something, we got Goon in the house cause he my cousin
We got dimes by the dozens, but without you girl, I'm nothing

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Everybody's on the floor, I can see your hands up
From the stage to the door
Calvin Harris on the decks
LMFAO is on the checks
One, two in the place to be
It pays to be, what's happening next
Baby you look so fine, I can tell with that look in your eye
That me and you in the bathroom
Has crossed your mind
I rock a chain on my chest
Cause I'm fresh to the death
And everyday I'm shuffling, I'm like a soldier with these steps
It's on and popping, there ain't no stopping
That bass is knocking, the shots are dropping
Some of us came to celebrate, but most of us came to get away
