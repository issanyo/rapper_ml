[Chorus]
We gon' go as far as we can go
Nobody knows how it all turns out
We promise to party out of control
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out

[Verse 1]
I'm walking in the club like every night
If you're hating on me, you must be in the line
I been on my grind, now it's my time
To kick back and enjoy this vodka and lime
Yo, I got my Party Rock crew, we raging
Shuffle bot and Q in the b-boy stance amazing
Got a beat that rocks the bass man
Industry that tries to chase me
When it's me, I'm only racing
So you see I'm first place, man

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we at the club tonight
Good vibes and we feeling right
Everybody, raise your shots
Cause this is what we do when we party rock
This is what we do when we party rock

[Chorus]
We gon' go as far as we can go
Nobody knows how it all turns out
We promise to party out of control
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out

[Verse 2]
I'm like that long shot, 30 to 1, strong slot
Never carry a gun, but I'm gon' pop
Now I'm earning some and it won't stop
Won't stop, can't stop, the man's hot
#1 in the dance spot, yo
#2 is the place for you if you're racing Foo, face it dude
I like to shock ya, rock ya, drink some vodka
Shots up to my crew and you and to my Foo fans
Move into the movement, groove into the smooth synth
This is a deep abyss, I keep a fist pumping
And the bass thumping, and I see your hands up in the air
We got this place jumping, taking these shots like we don't care
Yo, it's all good, she wants it all wood
I see some cuties with booties, I think we all should

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we at the club tonight
Good vibes and we feeling right
Everybody, raise your shots
Cause this is what we do when we party rock

[Chorus]
We gon' go as far as we can go
Nobody knows how it all turns out
We promise to party out of control
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out

[Pre-Chorus]
I know we at the club tonight
Good vibes and we feeling right
Everybody, raise your shots
Cause this is what we do when we party rock
This is what we do when we party rock

[Chorus]
We gon' go as far as we can go
Nobody knows how it all turns out
We promise to party out of control
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining, shining, shining
We gon' keep shining 'til the sun burns out
