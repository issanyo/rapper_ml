[Verse 1: HRVY]
I met this girl on a Monday (ay)
She took my heart like a valet
Then like we're birds, she can fly away (ay)
And now everyday's like a holiday

[Pre-Chorus: HRVY]
And we'll sit in the sun all day together
Flip-flop, cocoa butter, music everyday
Sunshine, beaches and we'll pretend our love's forever
(forever forever)

[Chorus: HRVY]
Holiday (Here we go again)
Holiday (And I'll be with you)
Holiday (Oh na-na na-na na-na na-na)
Love you like a holiday
And we'll sing
Love you like a holiday (Let's go)
Love you like a holiday

[Verse 2: HRVY]
When I started with you everything was oh so simple baby
Then I got your number then I asked if you would play
And I know it's precious 'cause our time is on a limit
Love you like a holiday, ooh

[Chorus: HRVY]
Holiday (Here we go again)
Holiday (And I'll be with you)
Holiday (Oh na-na na-na na-na na-na)
Love you like a holiday
And we'll sing
Love you like a holiday
Love you like a holiday

[Verse 3: Redfoo]
Redfoo, lets go
Yo, when I walk the street
All the girls drive by and they go beep beep (beep beep)
Boo, when you with me
They get real jelly (who the hell is she?)
Yeah, that's my baby baby
My ice cream, my favorite flavor
The icing on my cinnamon roll
Then when you give me that sugar I go out of control

[Outro: HRVY & Redfoo]
Holiday (Here we go again)
Holiday (And I'll be with you)
Holiday (Oh na-na na-na na-na na-na)
Love you like a holiday
1-2-3, let's go!
Party Rock!
Love you like a holiday
Holiday (Here we go again)
Holiday (And I'll be with you)
Holiday (Oh na-na na-na na-na na-na)
Love you like a holiday
