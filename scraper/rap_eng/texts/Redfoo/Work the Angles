{*DJ Revolution scratches "Dilated Peoples"*}

[Hook: Dilated Peoples]
I work the angles sharp and precise
Dilated Peoples so you better build twice
{*"Act like ya know, not now but right now"*}
{*"Dilated Peoples.."*}

"The name is Iriscience"

[Iriscience]
I go through rivers (what?) so I don't leave a scent
I travel both directions but leave one set of prints
It's just a little trick, of the indigenous
Developing inner visions of what religion is
I caught the understanding and the underhanded
I plan to build my ship and man it to another planet
Under heavy surveillance, many different agents
Some are camouflage, others are very blatant
I study weapon systems and vocal fighting forms
I'm many moves ahead, the thoughts are highly formed
Like time times time is time squared
Went there, sayin "Rakaa you don't rhyme fair"
But I never dummy lyrics and they kick it to my people
It's about communication not a rappers ego
Messages I sneak in they seem to seep in
Mixed with alcohol and weed on the weekend
Shared among friends like various sins
One day it clicks it's no longer dim
Time release capsules humble the headstrong
Your thoughts of takin me head on are dead wrong

[Hook]

[Evidence]
{*"Evidence"*} It's the master of Aikido
I let go, karate confrontations
Evidence scientist in innovation
I locks on when I travels around planets
Smooth but got a rough edge like Wulitzer pianists
Display mucho attack, receive payments for the cadence
A in this, you get fit foul with flagrance
Free agents on the dotted line more hard to sign
Not easily impressed with gold mines and whole nines
I'm somewhere in-between never rushed and in a hurry
And when I swing my bat I don't think I'll miss like baseball
Furies the jury's hung, from verdict and got no chance
Dilated comes first the rest are second like Stu Lantz
Oh yes it get better everyday
The aged wine is my mind on vintage display
Unattended in this case
(The Ace two steps ahead)
Everyday is Mayday and best friends are Feds
But I know this that's why they closest
In a crisis situation you negotiate first
I'm perfectly focused
Strategic and in a zone
It was radar detected but my speed was unknown
Anonymity, that's my key to survival
Ev is not for Evidence it's for all the dense on trial
Just remember in this game it take two to tango
Don't go to them let them come to you
And work the angles

[Hook]
