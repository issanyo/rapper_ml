[Hook]
I'm too much
Girl, with a body like this, no need to do much
I walk in this bitch and I'm your new crush
Who's got a lot of bottles? My crew does
Cause we too much
We at the tables to ask fellas
This is for the fable
Cinderella, she walks in the stable
At the afterparty bitches wanna do us
Cause we too much

[Verse 1]
Now get yo ass up on the floor
Do that dance 'til your feet get sore
She dropping low, popping slow
These thots [?], she gone
She sipping on champagne straight from the bottle
She's living the fast lane, full throttle
We making it rain like we won the lotto
Now after party up in my grotto

[Hook]
I'm too much
Girl, with a body like this, no need to do much
I walk in this bitch and I'm your new crush
Who's got a lot of bottles? My crew does
Cause we too much
We at the tables [?]
This is for the fable
Cinderella, she walks in the stable
At the afterparty bitches wanna do us
Cause we too much

[Verse 2]
Now what you hear is funky fresh
It's Redfoo on the beat
And to the girl with the booty and the big ol' breasts
Come on, try to see your feet
Oh yeah, cause I'm too much
Working out at the gym but ain't too buff
Purped up at the club, blacked out
She twerking on me with her man passed out
Plus, his girl's a rental
Which goes against Redfoo's fundamental
I'm too hot, it'd be dumb to settle
I got all these bitches, need to run a kennel

[Outro]
Yeah, cause I'm too much, baby
When I walk in, I'm your new crush, baby
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, twerk it on the floor
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it on the floor
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it like a pro
Work it like a professional
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, twerk it, twerk it on the floor
Twerk it, twerk it, twerk it on the floor
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it like a pro
Work it like a professional
