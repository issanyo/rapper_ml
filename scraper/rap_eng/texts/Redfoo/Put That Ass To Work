[Chorus: Redfoo]
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
When you hear our song
Don't just bop along
Girl show me that thong
And put that ass to work
We got Ciroc
And patron on lock
If you wan' another shot
Then put that ass to work
Sexy girl I can tell your a rebel
Low cut skirt and five inch stilettos
Pink top
Piercing with heavy metal
And you're looking at me
Like whipped cream on jello
If you, if you, if you wanna go with me
Then you gotta be a pro indeed

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me see you shake it 'till you make it
In my phone book, then maybe I get you naked (Ow)

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Don't hurt yourself
I'ma let you stretch
Bitch shake that booty like was an etch-n-sketch
I love your wiggle
When your hips swivel
Looking so good you got my thang on missile
Heat seeker
Coming straight for you
Meet me in my room
1422

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me see you shake it 'till you make it
In my phone book, then maybe I get you naked (Ow)

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work

[Bridge]
Put that ass to work, put, put that ass to work (Stay on the grind)
Put that ass to work, put, put that ass to work (Like a 9 to 5)
Put that ass to work, put, put that ass to work (Stay on the grind)
Put that ass to work, put, put that ass to work (Like a 9 to 5)
Work
Work

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
Sexy girl all around the world
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work
