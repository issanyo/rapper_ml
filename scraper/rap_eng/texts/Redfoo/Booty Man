[Intro]
She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce, bounce, bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto
Up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce, bounce, bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto

[Verse 1]
Yo, tonight I got a party to throw
At the Party Rock mansion, gon' be gnarly fo sho
Yeah, me and my crew feeling restless
We need some more booties on the guest list
First stop is the gas station
I like to call it the GAS station
I always see girls bumping it up, stumble on up
I say "What's up?" and ask questions
"Excuse me, what you doing tonight?
I got a party at my crib, I'm picking you to invite"
Woo, she got a booty that's out the frame
I nicknamed it High Octane
I made it her laugh, told her some balderdash
And in a flash, walked away with the math
Next stop, Whole Foods
Me and the crew, we call it WHOLE Foods
It be cracking on the weekend
The only place you can find a big booty on a vegan
Her name was Shelly, tattoos and a ring on her belly
The only problem, that her arms are smelly
It didn't matter to me, cause all that jelly

[Hook]
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty, the booty
The booty man, booty man, booty man
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty, the booty
The booty man, booty man, booty man
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto

[Post-Hook]
She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce, bounce, bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto

[Verse 2]
Chilling at the Roosevelt, faded as fuck
I'm 'bout to go home cause I'm way too stuck
Too many guys, this party is dead
Then I see a big booty, eyes pop out my head
Like "awooo," I start shuffling
In the circle, I was hustling, bustling
I grabbed the floaty, I was dancing with the swan
Did the nae nae and hit the quan
It was the waitress and black stilettos
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto
Look at that pint of jello
I was about to say goodbye but the booty said "Hello"
I said "How ya doing?"
I had imagination conversation with her booty
"You wanna hit this" is what it told me
And that confirmed I'm better off as the old me
A straight OG, I ain't Loki
Want all the booties in the world to know me
Why?

[Hook]
Cause I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty, the booty
The booty man, booty man, booty man
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty, the booty
The booty man, booty man, booty man
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto

[Bridge]
What comes up must come down
Booty go 'round and side to side
What comes up must come down
Booty got me so high tonight
What comes up must come down
Booty go 'round and side to side
What comes up must come down
Booty got me so high tonight

[Hook]
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty, the booty
The booty man, booty man, booty man
In a high class place where the white girl ghetto
