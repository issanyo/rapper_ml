[Hook: Redfoo]
We came here to party (rock)
We didn't come here to fight
I say, we grab ourselves a bottle
And toast to the good life

[Verse 1: Sky Blu]
Just cause a guy got a suit and a tie don't mean he gonna tax ya
Just cause I walk with a limp like an old school pimp don't mean I'll slap ya
But if you wanna talk tough, and you wanna puff up, then I might just have to
But I ain't come here to clock your mouth, (no!) I came here to rock the house (ho!)
Yeah, I get crazy wild, anything for the fans to make them smile
Goose and girls, that's my style, if you think I'm a thug, then you in denile
But you know when push come to shove, we protect ourselves and the ones we love
Stay at home, sit and judge, or celebrate life and hit the club

[Pre-Hook: GoonRock]
Everybody just wants to feel good
From up on Capitol Hill to the hood
Often times we get misunderstood
But tonight's our night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
They call you suit and tie, you's a politician
They call me super-fly, I'm always with two bitches
You go to church ties, I grew up with them scriptures
You on your P's and Q's, I'm sippin' Jeezy Juice
We both get a lot of attention in the press
You sellin' books and wanna be the President
We sellin' hooks, and the flow is heaven sent
We both hustlin', so why we tusslin'?

[Pre-Hook]

[Break]
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
I came here to rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
G-g-get, get, get wild
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock the house
Rock, r-rock, rock - get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get wild
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get crazy
Get, g-get, get, g-get, get wild
