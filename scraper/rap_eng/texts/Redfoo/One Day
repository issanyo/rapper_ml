[Verse 1]
Sipping on this drink, got some time to think
About where I was, and where am I'm at today
I'm getting everything I ask for
Flying the world, filling up my passport
I'm in the zone, martini's strong, my time is short, but my money long
I'm getting everything I ask for, In the club, always keep my glass full

[Hook]
Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

[Verse 2]
Hey, everybody came to play
I love it when the DJ plays all my favorite songs
And everybody sings along
I see the pretty babies at the pool, but all I can think about is you

[Hook]
Money in the bank, my car brand new
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day
House on the hill, Hollywood view
I got everything I want but you
I might get you one day
I might get you one day

[Outro]
When I get you girl, you gonna be so in love with me
Every day, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
Every night I think of you in every way
And when I get you, I'mma celebrate
Hey, I'mma celebrate
I'mma celebrate
I'm gonna celebrate
Cause I'm gonna get you one day
