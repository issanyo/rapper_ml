[Hook: LMFAO & Natalia]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour
Let the party rock!

[Verse 1: Redfoo & Natalia]
Put your hands up
Everybody just dance up
We came to party rock
Flash your titties like Mardi Gras, HA
They call me Redfoo
I walk in the club with a bottle or two
Shake it, spray it on a body or two
And walk out the party with a hottie or two, oh

[Bridge: Redfoo (Natalia)]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget (won't forget - no)

[Hook]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour
Let the party rock!

[Verse 2: Skyblu]
Boom!
Guess who stepped in the room
SkyBlu, Redfoo and Goon
He's a party rocker from night 'til noon
And it's about to be a champagne monsoon
Baby girl, you look legit
Come to my table and take a sit
Open wide cause we're spraying it
Fifty six bottles ain't paid for shit

[Bridge]
I'm gonna get you wet
I'm gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget (won't forget - no)

[Hook]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour
I said
Champagne showers
Champagne showers
Pop pop pop pop it in the club
We light it up 80 hour, 80 hour

[Skyblu]
Party people
Now I want you to grab your bottles
Put them up in the air
Now shake, shake, shake that bottle and make it [pop]

[Outro: Natalia]
We're gonna get you wet
We're gonna make you sweat
A night you won't forget
Are you ready for it?
Oh
Oh
Oh
