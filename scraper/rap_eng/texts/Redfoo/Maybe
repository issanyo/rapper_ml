[Verse]
Maybe I wrote this song cause I had to
Maybe I wrote this song to pay the bills
Maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone
Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you
Maybe I wrote this song for the super fans
Maybe I wrote this song to show 'em exactly who I am
Maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone
Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you

Yeah, Jason on the drum

[Chorus]
All I can see in this world is you and me
Living and laughing and playing as one
But when I have to leave you, I realize that I need to
Look you in the eyes and say I love you

Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you

[Chorus]
Cause all I can see in this world is you and me
Living and laughing and playing as one
But when I have to leave you, I realize that I need to
Look you in the eyes and say I love you

[Outro]
Maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone
Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you
I said maybe I wrote this song for an excuse when we're alone
Maybe I wrote this song to say I love you
I love you
