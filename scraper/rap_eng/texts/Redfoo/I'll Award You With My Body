[Verse 1]
Hot flashes in your face
They call your name all over the place
What you see Redfoo with the animal print
When you move real quick hands up in the sprint
Yeah ! Whip that hair !
Turn around, stop and stare
Work it and it ain't hard to see
You got what it takes to be a nominee

[Verse 2]
Let's shake the tape
Does the red carpet ma-match the drape
I shake that body like a mount of Play-Doh
I peel that dress like a ripe potatoe
Skin tight all night
Sweatin' like we were just tipin' a fight
Finish last too much to handle
I got something big to put on your mantle

[Interlude 1]
And it ain’t a Mackerel
And it ain’t a Jackle
And it ain’t a fracktal
But it'll last forever
And it ain’t a sweater
And it ain’t pleather
More like a leather
Lets sing together

[Interlude 2]
Girl, I'm lookin' for a winner
(Who's hungry ?) For the dinner
And maybe just show me
Do you want the big trophy ?

Oh not a lobster a lozenger !
