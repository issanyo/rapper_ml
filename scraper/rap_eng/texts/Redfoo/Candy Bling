[Intro]
I still remember
That hazy September
I've been waitin' for somebody like you
To come back around

[Verse 1]
We would walk in the park every Saturday
Brand new all in love kissin' time away
You was all up on me, it was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple things
Anklets, name plates that you gave to me
Sweet tarts, Ring Pops
Had that candy bling
And you were my world

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ, play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

[Chorus]
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind

[Verse 2]
It was everything that I could do
To stay away
And I often reminisce
About the games we played
Oh yeah, it was tag, chase, spin the bottle
Them butterflies would last till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
And I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long

[Chorus]
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind

[Bridge]
I'm the same Mimi
Fame ain't changed me
Butterfly flow like Muhammad Ali
Wish I can bring you back like the O.D.B
Thinkin' about the whirlpools
Me you and Jack
No matter what I do
All the memories are stacked
Thinkin' 'bout 10th grade
Thinkin' 'bout 11th
Then you went Dougie Fresh
All the way to heaven

[Chorus]
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind
