[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
You might not wanna jog on this one
Get head away for the summer
You already hot, I’m already hot
No sweat, no under armor
Louboutin Spikes, or the big night
Holla back, if you need a spazer
Yeah, aight, the mr all right
Come around, with a few more karmas
Come here girl, do what I gotta talk rospetta
See me with lil’ mama, kinda make you jealous
Yeah be a honor, gotta say you special
Beat her like a drama girl, you better be careful
Comprende, what’s a bit late
Like Fred Rick I’ll be jet lagged
Calling on you this moment, this instant
What I do is just basic instinct

[Pre-Chorus]
You see me all over her, you want me all over you
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do

[Chorus]
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you, uh, uh

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Head start, you got that shorty
On your marks, 'til the shots get started
Can you level on the rocks Bacardi
Relay cause they’re at the party
Pass the bottles, level up get naughty
Full speed, hurry up, put your body
Track me thick cause ferrari
Meet a freak, build cause I’m sorry
You ain’t get the memo, BMA get low
See the finish the line, looking like like a limbo
Yeah we going we in, no night like tempo
There’s another bad chick make light most simple
Mr Vrenda, no beginner, first place, tryna make you winner
Yeah baby, my Brenda, I’ll be waiting in the spot descender

[Pre-Chorus]
You see me all over her, you want me all over you
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do

[Chorus]
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you, uh, uh

[Bridge: Redfoo]
Y’all
We in the spot, the club is hot
And if you wanna party rock, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Nonstop, the bottle’s popped
And if you want another short, say hell yeah (hell yeah)
I’m gonna run to you so you can have a little bit of fun with Foo
I know what you wanna do when I wiggle wiggle wiggle in my Underoos
Got you wet, dripping like SoCo
Never should’ve let you bounce on my pogo
Now you wanna be my Yoko Ono
So you roll stop actin like you don’t know

Foo!
I’m running through these hoes like Drano
But I keep it low pro, cause she’s my Maino (ooh)
I got your tickets, they’re on Fandango
Back room, no fro, I’ll be eating a mango

[Chorus]
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you, uh, uh
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna run to you, I wanna, I wanna, I
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong
I wanna run to you
(Wanna run to you)
