Yeah, yeah Cuando salgo a andar
Girls be looking like que duro está
Yo soy el cangri aqui, walking on the street
In my new lafreak, yeah
This is how I roll, animal print, pants fuera control
Estoy guillao con mi big afro
Y como Bruce Leroy, I got the glow yo

This is what I see (OK)
Todo el mundo para pa' mirarme a mí
I got passion in my pants and
I ain't afraid to show it, show it, show it, show it
I'm sexy and I know it
Soy sexy y lo sabes

Yo vacilando en el mall
Security just can't fight them off
Jangeo at the beach
I'm in a g-stro trying to tan my cheeks (What!)
This is how I roll, vamos ladies it's time to go
Nos fuimos pal' bar, baby cogelo suave
No shoes, no shirt, como quiera me sirve, watch...
