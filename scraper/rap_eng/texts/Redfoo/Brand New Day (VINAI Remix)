[Intro: Redfoo]
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
The sun is rising
It melts the pain away
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
And there's a silver lining
To every cloud that comes your way
(comes your way)

[Bridge 1: Instrumental + Redfoo]
Party Rock!
And this is what I gotta say

[Hook 1: Redfoo w/ Instrumental]
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
And there's a silver lining
To every cloud that comes your way
(comes your way)

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Wake up in the morning, rise and shine
I see my dreams in these eyes of mine
List my to-do's for the day, yo
Then execute for the payload
AYYYYY, HOHHHHH, I feel amazing
Then I read the headlines
I start to feel crazy
Looking at the news
It seems we're divided
But when I'm looking at you
I see us united (Party Rock!)

[Bridge 2: Redfoo]
And this is what I gotta say
In the words of Marvin Gaye
Only love can conquer hate

[Pre-Hook: Redfoo]
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
The sun is rising
It melts the pain away
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
And there's a silver lining
To every cloud that comes your way
(comes your way)

[Hook 2: Redfoo + Instrumentals]
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
The sun is rising
It melts the pain away
