[Verse 1]
Speak to me
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe
I should be running, but the heart's naive
And I expect too much
You were good to me
I left a scar that no one else can see
And now you're back here
And reminding me that I lost way too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back?

[Chorus]
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand here in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

[Post-Chorus]
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

[Verse 2]
Say my name
'Cause no one else can say it quite the same
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much
If I was cruel to you
Well just to hear it, breaks my heart in two
If there's a way to make it up to you
I wanna change so much, you know I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
And you almost said it back?

[Chorus]
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand here in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

[Bridge]
Stay with me
I really need to hear you breathe
If words can't speak, lay your body next to me

[Chorus]
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand here in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

[Outro]
More than a memory
Lame my apology
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
