[Verse 1]
What I need is you and me
Sucking and fucking each other, the birds and the bees
You know you hot, but you ain't got
A nigga like me to hit the spot
Ecstasy is what we'll be
Tell your clique, we finna dip
You're coming with me
Oh, we gon' party at the afterparty
It's just I'mma take you home alone before everybody shows up

[Chorus]
Cause you got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby
You got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby

[Verse 2]
Cruising and strip in the convertible, hands up
I'm losing my grip cause you so beautiful when you stand up
In the backseat, hair blowing in the wind
Girl, watch yourself before I jump back there and get up in it
Now I'm actually ghost riding the whip
Cause I'm fucking with you
If we crash, I don't give a shit, no I don't
Cause girl, you make me so fucking hot, I wanna burn up
The way you make up at the spot when we turn up
It's beautiful
Girl, yo booty's full like the moon in the sky now

[Chorus]
Cause you got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby
You got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby

[Bridge]
You got me so lit
You got me so lit
Come and take me higher

[Chorus]
You got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby
You got me so lit
Come and take me higher, baby
