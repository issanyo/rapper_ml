[Intro: Redfoo]
Party rock!
Take it to the hole, yeah, yeah, yeah like that
Redfoo, red do with the pipe hat, yeah
Turn it up, turn it up!

[Hook: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
I take it to the hole, it's Redfoo I'm aggressive
Four moves ahead, wrong dude to play chess with
I roll with the best click flow so impressive
Shots automatic, better get you a vest quick
(He's heating up!) Could have guessed it
They all compete and they all get bested
Why try to test it, just digest it
Spit so clean that's why I dress so fresh, kid

You see that girl over there she big chested
Let's start my motor boat, face nested
When I do that, she screams all festive
When you do that, she screams, "I'm molested! "
Now you are arrested
While we're in the club being most requested
Step up loud to be the next contestant
To go down town and to see what blessed with

[Hook: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up

[Verse 2: Sky Blu]
Yo, give me the rock, I'm gonna rain in 3-point range
Whether you like it or not
LMFAO, we makin' the shots
And that's burning cause my hands is hot
Your team is just like a sandwich shop, we be eating them up
LMFAO we be beating them up
Halftime, we be sweepin' them up
On the court, I be running amok
There's no such thing as D-ing me up
Shot clock, three seconds left, I'm just gettin' started
And yo team out of breath
I juke right, fake to the left, pop, shot, count it, all night
I'm gettin' threes like I'm...
I think I might just top the team
Cause I've got the green
That's how I play in the league
And now I'm gonna be MVP, Sky Blu baby

[Bridge: Sky Blu]
Party people, party people, party people
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up
Do my ladies run this party? (Hell yeah!)
Or do my fella's run this party? (Hell yeah!)
I said do my ladies run this party? (Hell yeah!)
Or do my fella's run this party? (Hell yeah!)
Let's go!

[Hook: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, every single thing I spit on you know what it's cost
With some of my diamond shit on, you know who the boss
Either way I style on them all day make way
Put a smile for the women unless they know I don't play
People movin when I wake up and possessin' the best shit
Always the first to do with introducing the next shit
I ain't talkin', I ain't even put they neck down yet
To tell the truth a lot of nigga's need a background check, yo
Could give a fuck about your cute buzz
I return in case you may know who the truth was
And when you on the soundtrack and you ain't saying nothin'
I'm in a club bottle-sippin' and the bitches is jumpin'
When we step up in the buildin' and you see how we get it
And watch all of my nigga's back 'till you know how we did it
Throw it all up in the street just see the kid on a roll
And let me bang with this shawty when I take it to the hole

[Hook: Redfoo]
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole
I beat it up
