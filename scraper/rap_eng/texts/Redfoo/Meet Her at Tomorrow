[Chorus]
Pretty girl always on my mind
When I try to chase her, I be running out of time
Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow
If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow
Pretty girl always on my mind
When I try to chase her, I be running out of time
Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow
If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow

[Interlude]
What we had was magic
What we had was magic in our love
What we had was magic
What we had was magic in our love

[Verse 1]
Our love is like two doves in flight
Two gloves fitting tight, true loves will unite
Our love is like chemistry, heavenly
Ivory, ebony, opposites meant to be
And you're the one I'm choosing
That's why I keep our love cruising
In time, we will be back together

[Chorus]
Pretty girl always on my mind
When I try to chase her, I be running out of time
Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow
If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow
Pretty girl always on my mind
When I try to chase her, I be running out of time
Yesterday, I set her free, my heart's a little hollow
If it's really meant to be, then I'll meet her at tomorrow

[Outro]
What we had was magic
What we had was magic in our love
What we had was magic
What we had was magic in our love
