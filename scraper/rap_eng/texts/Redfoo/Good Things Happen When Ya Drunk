[Hook]
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
Good things happen when you're drunk

[Verse 1]
Shake that booty like a handshake
Flip, flip, flop it like a pancake
Crank that back like a handbrake
Drop it, pop it, then stand straight
I'mma just be chilling at the VIP
In the c-u-t with security
WOO-WEE
I like what I see, that b-u-t POV

[Pre-Hook]
Now this is what they call the funk
If you ain't take shots then you a punk
No need to waste time
Getting turnt up off of moonshine
And that's how we roll, out control, up out the door
Party rock and roll, snatch your ho, then out the door

[Hook]
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
Good things happen when you're drunk

[Verse 2]
Good things happen when I'm drinking
Look at my walk, it look like I'm sinking
I ain't dancing, I'm creeping
And if a big booty bitch walk by, I'm peeping
I ain't ashamed, nigga
I ain't afraid, I ain't shit
Everybody 360 with the wrists
Refoo, 360 on your bitch

[Pre-Hook]
This is what they call the funk
If you ain't take shots then you a punk
No need to waste time
Getting turnt up off of moonshine
And that's how we roll, out control, up out the door
Party rock and roll, snatch your ho, then out the door

[Hook]
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
This what I do in the club
Party with my crew in the club
Drink all night long in the club
Take something home in the club
Good things happen when you're drunk

[Verse 3]
When you're on the floor and she dropping low
Good things happen when you're drunk
In the porta-potty at the festival
Good things happen when you're drunk
When you're backstage and it's all a haze
Good things happen when you're drunk
At the house party, everybody says
Good things happen when you're drunk
Come on, now
Good things happen when you're drunk
