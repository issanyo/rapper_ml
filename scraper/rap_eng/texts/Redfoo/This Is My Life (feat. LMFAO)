This is my life

When I hop on stage, they all wanna talk
One by one, they all on my jock
Stop! Don't be mad
Which one of you's comin' to my pad?
Ok, this is our everyday
A couple shots of goose, light the j
I live life like a lunch break in every way
Either the club or stage is where I play
And this whole thing is a game to me
I meet a lot girls from A to Z
It's Red Foo in the place to be
Why you so pimp? cause it pays to be

Ok, drinkin in the club
Ok, getting that groupie love
Ok, yeah we rock the spot
Ok, ok, ok, we hot

(chorus)
Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life
Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life

Now step, now step, now step
Now step, now step, now step
Now step, now step and pop
Step to left, and catch a groove
Bring it back to the right that's whatcha do
True, why you sassin' me?
Donny Fontaine, I smash the beat
Girls want me as there man, I be like "no"
Call me Willis, I got a different stroke
Right now, I ain't tryin' to have a wife
You gotta understand, this is my life
I left the wife and the son at home
I partied all night, and now im ready to bone
What? I didn't know you had a kid
I don't but I got a little big ass dick

Ok, drinkin in the club
Ok, getting that groupie love
Ok, yeah we rock the spot
Ok, ok, ok, we hot

(chorus)
Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life
Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life

We laugh are asses off as we crush that soda pop
Hyper colors like no other so just back up off
We make our beats in our garage
It's our life, it's not a job
We're the bomb, we turn you on
Hair so fresh from the salon
Now step, now step, now step
Now step, now step, now step
Now step, now step and pop

Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life

This is my life
Yup, I'm a maniac
Bringing the best of the 80's back
Hoooo! Rock the party, yo!
Workin' it out like cardio
Yup, we gonna get all types of freakay
Any special request? I'm the bedroom DJ
Got your ass out of breath like a relay
Your freak so good, I put your ass on eBay
I walk in the club like a million times
I spit on the mic like a million rhymes
I'm in that b-boy stance
When Preston rock that beat you dance
Dance, rock that beat you dance, dance
Rock that beat you dance, dance
R-r-r-r-rock that beat you dance

Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life
Everybody it's a party
I'm feeling naughty
Baby, this is my life
