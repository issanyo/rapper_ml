[Verse 1]
Juicy...
I walked into the party
I seen somethin' I never saw
Everybody was movin', groovin
Girls, they were dancin' on the bar
Now this wasn't no ordinary dance
Hey man why is everybody swimmin' in a trance?
I couldn't figure it out like your grandpa's riddle
I asked 'em what they doing and they said Juicy Wiggle!
(Now move your hips and dance like fish)

[Chorus]
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[Verse 2]
Woooo Weeeii!
Now I done just lost my mind
All those people wigglin' they stuff..
(Hey man, you gonna do the dance?)
Man turn down for what!?
Give me a shot (Woo!)
Another shot (Woo!)
Y'all ain't ready for me to show you what I got. (Woo!)
Then my body froze up, it was getting to my head
What if I can't do it?
Then everybody said...

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Two girls was shakin' it, I jumped in the middle
I asked em what they doing an they said
Juicy Wiggle!

[Chorus]
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[Verse 3]
Right about now..
We really gonn' have some fun! (Oh Yeah?)
I'm talking bout tickling ivory (Woo!)
But first, I need some 151... and a match
(Wooo Weeeii!)
It's time to light it up, lets go now!

[Pre-Chorus]
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ah, get Juicy
Ain't nothing wrong with making it jiggle
So when the beats drops everybody
Juicy Wiggle!

[Chorus]
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy
Get Juicy
Get Juicy
Yeah, get Juicy

[End Hook]
So when the beat drops, everybody Juicy Wiggle
Yeah, Baby
Wooo!
