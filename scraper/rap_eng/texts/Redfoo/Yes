[Verse 1]
I see my dream, son!
Every time I dive in my pool, it's hard to be humble
When I do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel
And come up on the other side in a Jacuzzi
Being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties
They give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is
I say go and call your bitches cause there's gonna be a party
Next they wash my body as a team
And they say "Foo, your royal penis is clean!"
And I'm like

[Hook]

Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'
Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'

Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream
Ev-ev-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

[Verse 2]
Wakin' up next to a beautiful girl
Step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
Grandma's cooking breakfast; she makes pancakes the best
I check my MySpace and I've got a lot of friend requests
Yes!
I get to dancing as I, walk through my mansion cause I
Own property from California to the Hamptons and I
Sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
Look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor Oprah
I check to see how my album's doing today
The group LMFAO goes double platinum, hey
I gotta party, man, that's how I live
So I take my elevator to the club in my crib like

[Hook]
Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'
Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'
Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'
Yes, it's on and poppin'
Yes, this party's rockin'
Yes, the cutie's shockin'
Yes and there ain't no stopppin'

Every day I see my dream
Every day I see my-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream

Every day I see my-every day I see my dream
Every day I see my dream
