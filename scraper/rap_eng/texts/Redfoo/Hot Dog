[Intro]
Disco Foo

[Verse 1]
I work out every day
"You sexy!" Yeah, that's what they say
I eat right and stay committed
"You lost 30 pounds!" Yeah, they say I did it
Now I don't care what you think
(I'mma do my thing tonight!)
I came to dance, came to drink
(Living that disco life!)
I burned about a thousand cals
Dancing, moving, shaking, grooving
So fuck what my trainer say
I'm planning to get a hot dog!

[Hook]
(After this club)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)


[Verse 2]
"Street meat", yeah, that's what they call it
And lately I've become a dogaholic
Now, some vendors be real and some be faking
"What, you ain't got no bacon?"
Now, I don't care what you say
I want my money back
You ain't got no onions, got no peppers
And that dog ain't bacon wrapped
Now, to get it right, I gots to go and search the boulevard
Cause 9 to 5 and on the floor
(I work too Goddamn hard)
Finna get a hot dog

[Hook]
(after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)
I'm finna get a hot dog (after this club!)

[Outro]
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
Street meat!
