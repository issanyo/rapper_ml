[Hook]
Oh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cry, show me what you got girl
You could be my new thang
Oh, the way that you move
Makes me go cry, do you love that drop girl?
You could be my new thang

Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy

[Verse 1]
I heard it's your birthday
Grab a drink if you thirsty
I can see that you need an OG
That I can do you the best and the worst way
Pop it like a go-go, drop it like a low-low
What's that? It's a go-pro?
So I can watch that back, HD, slo-mo

[Pre-Hook 1]
I don't care if it's the first date
I'll take you back to my place
We can skip first base
Cause a player like me
Tryna slide into home plate
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Santa
But she sittin' on my lap

[Hook]
Oh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cry, show me what you got girl
You could be my new thang
Oh, the way that you move
Makes me go cry, do you love that drop girl?
You could be my new thang

Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy

[Verse 2]
I heard that you single
Now you talkin' my lingo
Let's play casino
Bring four friends plus you
Bingo! Yeah ain't nothing but a flirt
The way you bouncin in that shirt
It's amazing how you drop it
Pick it up and still make it work

[Pre-Hook 2]
Yo body lethal, I might LA freak you
Goddamn, that booty fat
Sittin high up on your back
What the fuck, did they feed you?
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Apple
But they call me the Mac

[Hook]
Oh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cray, show me what you got girl
You could be my new thang
Oh, the way that you move
Makes me go cray, do you love that drop girl?
You could be my new thang

And you're the type that
Makes me wanna do thangs
And that's why I'm tryna make you my new thang

Hey bae I know we hardly met
