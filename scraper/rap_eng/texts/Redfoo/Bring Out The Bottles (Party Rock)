Shake that girl, keep the bottles poppin'
If I take that girl, then the pen ain't chopping
But I wait right here cause I see more options

I got it, and now you want it
And then you need it, because I'll be there
Oh oh oh made a swing from mall

She dropped it low, I slapped it yo
And said this redfoo with the big a-fro
In the ear said; It's gon' be poppin' tonight
It's gon', it's gon' be poppin'
In the club I said: The champagne's poppin' tonight
