[Verse 1]
Cruising down the strand like "What's up?" Like "What's up?"
Girlies in the sand, tan and buzzed, tanning butts
My favorite shoes on my feet, my shorts say La Freak
And my tank is a shirt that's cut (Chicka ahhhhhhhhhhh)
Everybody think I'm a star (He's a star)
Riding slow, sitting low with my monkey handlebars
And I'm weaving through the skaters
And tripping on them haters
Cause I'm doing it real extra large

[Hook 1]
I got a Koozie on my brew so the cops don't sweat me
They ain't tripping on what I'm sipping on
Cause it look like a Pepsi
Ask me what I'm doing (What you doing?)
Ask me what I'm doing (What you doing?)
Ask me what I'm doing (What you doing?)
Ask me what I'm doing
I got a Koozie on my brew so the cops don't sweat me
They ain't tripping on what I'm sipping on
Cause it look like a Pepsi
Ask me what I'm doing (What you doing?)
Ask me what I'm doing (Uh, what are you doing?)
I'm at the beach, cruisin'
I'm at the beach, cruisin'

[Verse 2]
Today is the day I just cruise
I need to roll to the store to get some more brews
And I look so automatic weaving through the traffic
It's a bad habit, but goddamn it, the food smooth
I pull up at the grocery
Cling cling, cling cling so they know it's me
"No bikes allowed!" yelled security
But with my beat so loud, I ain't heard the G
Two girls like, "Hey, Foo!" I'm like, "Yeah, baby"
Cru-cru-cru-cruising down the aisle
Weaving through the old ladies
That Corona is a classic so I put some in my basket
Pull up to the clerk, she said, "Paper or plastic?"

[Hook 2]
Now security is hooting and hollering
But I, I, I, I can't be bothered, man
I'm like, ask me what I'm doing (What you doing?)
Ask me what I'm doing
(Uh, whatcha doing? What the fuck you doing?)
I'm at the beach, cruisin'
I'm at the beach, cruisin'

[Verse 3]
Lying on the beach feeling buzzed
These two girls aren't naked, but I really wish they was
Then they say, "Let's go back to our crib
You see that beach house?"
I'm like "That's where y'all live?"
They say "We're house sitting for my parents friends"
I'm like "Oh, really" as I pulled down my lens
Winked and a blink chilling at the kitchen sink
Pouring two more shots, it's really getting hot
Proceed to go to the jacuzzi
Both leading me and they showing me the booty
I feel it's my duty, I feel it's my job
This is the moment where I look up and thank God
We all got ridiculous, my kill count increases
They said they weren't religious but I made them scream "Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus..."

[Hook 3]
Ay yo, Q! Yeah, I just went in and got two
Hey man, where you at?
I'm at the beach cruisin'

[Outro]
Yeah, ok, well shit, yeah
Yeah, I'mma go pick up some more brews
You know what I'm saying
Yeah, yeah, call Dave, call Ryan, call Garcias
Let's go man, where's the party, man
Yeah, we gotta stay down here, you know what I'm saying
So we can save the, the fire pit
Yeah, cause they, they filling up right now
Yeah, I'll be here, I'll get the wood, man
Oh, you know I got the wood
Yeah, let's go, say oh oh, ow ow
Say ooh ooh, say ooh ooh
Now party over here
Say what? Party over here
Say what? Party over here
Say what? Now party over here
Say what?
