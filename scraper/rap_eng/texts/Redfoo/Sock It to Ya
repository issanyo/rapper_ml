Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'ma sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Now slide
Now slide

I'ma just be chilling on the scene
If they talking sexy, they talking 'bout me
They be tryna bite me, I'm talking 'bout fleas
Baby, you excite me, I'm talking 'bout bees

Everybody checking what I'm wearing
When I walk up in the place and everybody starting
'Cause I gotta groove when I move
When I'm walking down the block
Feeling so good 'cause my socks

Now I'ma sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Now slide
Now slide

Tonight, we gon' party at my villa
Only bring hot girls, no chinchillas
We gon' party rock, girl, shots won't kill us
And when you go topless, please don't bill us

I don't really care about your Nike
You gotta take your shoes off at my house, baby, get lighting
We brought in many booze and party rock and getting hyphy
And all the girls are eyeing me 'cause the way I'm sliding

Now I'ma sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Now slide
Now slide

Now I'ma sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide

Sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, sock it to ya
Sock it, sock it to ya
Sock it to ya, now slide
