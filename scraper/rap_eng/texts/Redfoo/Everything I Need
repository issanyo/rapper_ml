[Intro: Redfoo]
Party Rock

[Verse 1: Redfoo]
Yo, when I walk up in the spot
All the chickies think I'm hot
And this is what I do
Take shots with my crew and I'm FaceTiming you
And when I roll up on the scene
It ain't my fault I'm in they drinks
And all I want is you
So don't be mad when I'm getting money with the crew

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Baby, you are everything I need
My shooting star, my cup of tea
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat
Baby, you are everything I need
My shooting star, my cup of tea
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat

[Post-Chorus: Redfoo]
You make my heart skip a beat

[Verse 2: Redfoo]
Yo, I think we need to talk
Let's go outside, take a walk
I know something ain't the same
I can hear it in your voice, I can see it in your face, hey
Why we always fight before I'm 'bout to take flight?
Baby, I'll be back in a week
Every time we break up, I can never get sleep, no

[Chorus: Redfoo]
Baby, you are everything I need
My shooting star, my cup of tea
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat
Baby, you are everything I need
My shooting star, my cup of tea
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat
Every time I feel you next to me
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat

[Post-Chorus: Redfoo]
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
You make my heart skip a beat
