[Verse 1: Redfoo (Lil Jon)]
Redfoo! (OH! LET'S ROCK!)
Yo! We in the club
We bottle poppin'
We sippin' that bubbly
We-we-we Party Rockin'
You got a big ol' butt
I can tell by the way you're walkin
But you annoying me...cause you're talkin.(STFU!)
Bounce on the pogo
Jump on the jack hammer
Get low low low
While I Instagram ya
Shhh, don't talk about it, Be about it
Work it and twerk it, and maybe I'll tweet about it
They'll read about it
And you could be winnin'
I said jump on the pole
I didn't MEAN your opinion
Girl I'm sipping on this drink
I'm tryna see what you got
Not tryna hear what you think

[Verse 2: Enertia McFly]
Look...I'm tryna get your fine ass on the dance floor
Girl I wanna see you get low
Go ahead and bring it up slow
You're booty in my hand is my new motto
Got the face of a model
Put your lips on my bottle
Let me see you take it to the head
Girl I know that you can
I don't wanna hear no
Girl have you heard of my new super friends?
Play-N-Skillz, Redfoo and Lil Jon they comin' in
And turn the party to a crazy mad house
Going all night until I just black out
After I do all that we can make out
Girl you know what Enertia all about
