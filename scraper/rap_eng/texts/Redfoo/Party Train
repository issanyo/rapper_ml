[Verse 1]
Yo, I need to know
Who came to turn up at their favorite festival
I need some people, some party people
To jump on stage and rage with your bro
That's why I'm calling all my ravers, best-in-candy flavors
Calling all my hipsters too cool to be my listeners
Calling all the scenesters with ironic t-shirts
"Say no to drugs", "Gay for pay" and "Free Justin Bieber"

[Hook 1]
"Excuse me, who are you? Excuse me, who are you?"
I am the conductor, the beat is your instructor
All aboard!
Get on that party train

[Post-Hook]
Get on that party train
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Get on that party train

[Verse 2]
I can feel I need to let loose, loose in your caboose
I need to drink some juice with some gin so I can win
And party with all of my friends
That's why I'm calling all my groupies
And rats that like them bottles
Calling all my duck-faced Instagram models
Calling all the cuties doing squats for their booties
And Snapchatters, I need more disappearing boobies

[Hook 2]
Ass, cash or flash, no one rides for free
Ass, cash or flash, no one rides for free (But me!)
I am the conductor, the beat is your instructor
Get on that party train

[Post-Hook]
Get on that party train
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chigga chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug
Get on that party train
