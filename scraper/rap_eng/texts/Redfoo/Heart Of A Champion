[Intro]
We go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, till we reach the top !

We go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, till we reach the top !
I said, we go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, hard, hard ...

[Hook]
It takes the heart of a champion
The fist of a fighter
Going the ditance to be the survivor
When you're losing, you're breathing
And then your body is sore
To be the last one standin'
In the eye of a storm !
It takes the heart of a champion, the heart of a champion
It takes the heart of a champion, the heart of a champion

We go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, till we reach the top !
I said, we go hard, we don't stop
Party Rock ! Let's go !
Let's get fired up !

[Verse]
We go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, till we reach the top !
I said, we go hard, we don't stop
We go hard till we reach the top !

Yo, you gotta start aggressive
Keep your feet movin'
You gotta really want it
With everything you're doin'
Plan your work and work your plan
I like to hit winners, it excites the fans
And if it gets tough (tough)
And you fall behind ('hind)
Thatâ€™s when you really focus
Positive mind !
You can come back and win and get the glory
This is what my daddy told me !

[Hook]
It takes the heart of a champion
The fist of a fighter
Going the ditance to be the survivor
When you're losing, you're breathing
And then your body is sore
To be the last one standin'
In the eye of a storm !
It takes the heart of a champion, the heart of a champion
It takes the heart of a champion, the heart of a champion

We go hard, we don't stop
We go hard, till we reach the top !
I said, we go hard, we don't stop
Party Rock ! Let's go !
Let's get fired up !
