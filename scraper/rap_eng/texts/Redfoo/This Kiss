[Verse 1]
I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention (your attention)
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention (forgot to mention)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you...
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're taking it way too far
But I don't want it to end

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss

[Verse 2]
You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession (my confession)
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension? (Feel the tension)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you...
I'm dancing to where you are
And your dancing to where I am
We're taking it way too far
But I don't want it to end

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss

[Bridge]
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't, I
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't, I
I shouldn't, I shouldn't
I don't wanna miss this kiss

[Chorus]
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
