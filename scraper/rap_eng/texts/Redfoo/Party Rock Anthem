[Hook: Maggie Szabo & Gianni Luminati, Ryan Marshall]
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
We just wanna see you...
Shake that!

[Verse 1: Gianni Luminati, (Ryan Marshall), & Mike Taylor]
In the club, party rock
Looking for your girl? She's on my jock, oh
Non stop when we in the spot
Her booty moving weight like she on the block
Um, here the drank, I've got to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black, half-white: domino
Gang of money, Oprah dough
Ooh, I’m running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow, rock and roll no halo, (we party rock!)
Yeah, (that’s the crew that I’m reppin')
On the rise to the top, no lead in our zeppelin, yeah

[Hook: Maggie Szabo & Gianni Luminati, Ryan Marshall]
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
We just wanna see you...
Shake that!

[Ryan Marshall]
Every day I’m shufflin'

[Verse 2: Ryan Marshall & (Gianni Lumunati)]
Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We get money, don’t be mad, now stop - hatin' is bad
One more shot for us (oh, another round)
Please fill up my cup (don’t mess around)
We just wanna see (you shake it now)
Now you wanna be (you're naked now)

[Bridge: Maggie Szabo, & Gianni Luminati, (&Ryan Marshall)]
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
(Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound)
Put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound
(Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up)
Get up, put your hands up to the sound
To the sound
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up)

[Hook: Maggie Szabo & Gianni Luminati, Ryan Marshall]
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good time
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time
And we gon' make you lose your mind
Everybody just have a good, good, good time
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Shake that!
