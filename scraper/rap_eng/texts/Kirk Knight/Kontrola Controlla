Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
My new broad, thats a fine chick
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
These bitches, they fuck and suck dick
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
The teacher teachin' arithmetic
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine
When you get that itch, adrenaline
And fools run up wrong, nigga I'm knockin out some teeth
If she not, I’ll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone, Breathe!

[Refren: Big W]
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga

Hit 'em up, piece on my side
Outside of Popeyes eating chicken and fries
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
I seen a man raise his hand on the stand, he testified
I just hit a lick, I’m telling you this shit amazing
Just call me Baby Jesus, ‘cause lately niggas be praising me
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
On sight, catch a charge I might
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite (5)
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
You niggas smoking sevens I'mma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh
Saying that Kevin's too aggressive, maybe one day he may mellow out
We gon get mac elevens and dog niggas (wipe me down)
I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh

[Refren: Big W]

My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafucking niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga

Shawty, you the hottest, love the way you drop it
So good I swore you went to college
Hundred karat deposit, to vacations in the tropics
‘Cause e'rybody know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You need never ever gotta go to yo' wallet
Long as I got rubberband banks in my pocket
Five, six rides with rims and a body kit
You ain't gotta downgrade, you can get what I get
My chick could have what she want
And go in any store for any bag she want
And, no, she ain't never had a man like that
To buy you anything your heart desire like that, yeah
