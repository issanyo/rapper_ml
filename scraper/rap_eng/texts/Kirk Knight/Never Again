[Verse 1]
4 AM, comin' off strong
4 AM, you ain't got nothin' on
Pissed off, then you headin' off home
My bed is where you belong (Belong)
I always have a great time with you, baby
I ain't really been myself, as of lately
So when you love me, I over-appreciate it
'Cause I don't know when God gon' put me on the pavement
Think too much, I'm just sayin'
When I'm stressin', my body be achin'
You know what to do, don't even gotta say shit
Turn you on, let me watch for entertainment
Ain't no remote location
Shrooms every mornin', take a day trip
You'd do anything to show the dedication
First one tellin' me that I'ma make it, yeah

[Chorus]
You told me, "Let's stick it out 'til the end," I know
Had to lose you to realize you the best, I know
Lately you've been stuck up in my head, I know
Got me scramblin', tryin' to make amends, I know
You told me, "Let's stick it out 'til the end," I know
Had to lose you to realize you the best, I know
Lately you've been stuck up in my head, I know
Got me scramblin', tryin' to make amends
But no, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again

[Verse 2]
4 AM, got you sayin', "Don't stop"
4 AM, we ain't worried 'bout a clock
But 4 AM, I'm really stuck in these thoughts
This is too good to be true, you want me for what I got
'Cause you got me back in, nothin' on but my socks
And if I get caught up with homies on corners
You packing your bags, fly across any border
We changin' our names and just starting life over
You love me so much, but I can't make the room for it
Too young for love, live a fast life maneuverin'
Know that I cheated, I'm tired of provin' it
Lookin' like a nigga caught no feelings for his old thing
Never let it get to the wedding ring
I turn her on, now she only thinkin' offspring

[Chorus]
You told me, "Let's stick it out 'til the end," I know
Had to lose you to realize you the best, I know
Lately you've been stuck up in my head, I know
Got me scramblin', tryin' to make amends, I know
You told me, "Let's stick it out 'til the end," I know
Had to lose you to realize you the best, I know
Lately you've been stuck up in my head, I know
Got me scramblin', tryin' to make amends
But no, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
No, no, no, no, no
But no, no, no, no, no, not again
