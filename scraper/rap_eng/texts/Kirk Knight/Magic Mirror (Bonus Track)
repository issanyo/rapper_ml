[Intro]
Self-reflect on wrongs just to lead me right
Magic mirror on the wall can I change my life
Self-reflecting on these wrongs just to lead me right
Magic mirror on the wall can I change my life
Everybody change they life

[Verse 1]
Smoke my last joint up to the city lights
Got a miss itty bitty tryna get it right
She from Cali I'm in *censored* I can change your life
I told her if she tired you can just sleep on the flight
Designer bag for every one of my sleepless nights
A cold blooded animal, always give her frost
As I reach my highest peak
Get bipolar for a minute but
Never on the ash, cause my service is authentic
Nigga life is a bitch, I deserve to back in
And every time I roll up I see niggas acting
Similar to Benjamin Button get younger with my time
Coming sooner than the game
I'm fly without the wings
Looks impossible to cage us, not the reason why I sing
And music is the motive yeah, that's the dope I slang
Refrain from the picture that these niggas made framed
So I'm up in the jet, new check, I'm getting green
What I'm saying

[Hook]
Self-reflect on wrongs just to lead me right
Magic mirror on the wall can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
Self-reflecting on these wrongs just to lead me right
Magic mirror on the wall can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
Everybody chang they life

[Verse 2]
I used to cry myself a river but now I just walk on water
I'm deep within that music, I'm feeling like undercover
Brother with hard choices in life will circle the other
Underground living, but only trying to build above us
My situation was cluttered
Piling, collecting dust
Gave me asthma, need company, mama crib was a must
Backstabbed to my family
I meant no harm, but any cause of victory
From a sacrifice I had to take a loss
But never compromising what I feel up in my heart
Can't dwell on the past, life's to fast for a thought
And protecting my neck with bulletproof, ascots
And my motherboard needed new expansion slots
So I'm working ten to ten, buzz a beater on the clock
I made my shot
And thats without a auto or a Glock
And I never looked down, I knew it's lonely at the top
So I pulled myself together, chin up, life's in my hands
Yep!

[Hook]
Self-reflect on wrongs just to lead me right

(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
Self-reflecting on these wrongs just to lead me right
Magic mirror on the wall can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
(Yeah) Can I change my life
Everybody chang they life
