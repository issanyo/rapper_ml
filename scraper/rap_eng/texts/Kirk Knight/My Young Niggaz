[Bridge 1]
Please enter my trap now
These niggas enter my trap now
It’s too late to back out

[Hook]
Bet I could do this in my sleep
My young niggas stay with the heat
Fuck yo bitch, then hit the yeet now
These niggas lie through their teeth now

[Bridge 2]
Through their teeth, niggas lyin’ all through their seat
Niggas lying all through their teeth
And that's the word on all these streets
Niggas lying all through their teeth
Niggas lying all through their teeth
And that’s the word on all these streets

[Verse 1]
Tell me, which man are you?
Do we gotta sell dope, or bang them hammers too?
Do you got to prove it all for the cameras too?
Black men, more like caged animal
I’m from the Brooklyn Zoo
Where my dogs at?
For the pigs in the blue
For the project rat, in the trap with the snake, but they’re both going to bite you
Probably won’t strike, but they goin’ try to
But they both gonna spite you
Get a text from the [?], come fight you
Follow me, follow me, follow me
To a fuckin’ death trap of my forced reality
Don’t forget to paint my picture when I’m gone
Read ‘em scriptures, read the motherfuckin’ Palms
Might want to take this literature, with ya
To the after-life, where it's probably gonna hit ya

[Hook + Bridge 2]

[Verse 2]
Is this the American dream? Or is this what the American seem to be?
Looking at the messages that my heaven has sent really make life feel so evanescent
'Til every single cent is spent every [?] better breath all this reefer in
Maybe then they can understand it, we'll damn near damage every single aspect in plain
Everybody coming all out in vein, when they screaming shit out they call out his name
It seems everybody want someone to blame, remembering 9-11, who forgot Hussein
It's a shame, cause I don't feel like calling no more
I should go to Italy so I could roam some more
Across city simile, microphone control
Feel it in yo' body probably go chromosome
Shawty head [?] give me dome or something
Stick it in till you feel it in yo' ribs or something
Same spoiled brat in a bigger crib or something
After all that I could say I lived through something
Fuck all that noise something big to come
Say you loved the people what you ever did for them?
Heater on my lap probably took the pig
Rep B-K like the second coming of BIG or something

[Hook + Bridge 2]

[Bridge 1]
You done entered my trap now, it's too late to fucking back out
You done entered my trap now

[Verse 3]
My brothers banged, I was a scholar
I knew them Crips but couldn't die for them blue colors
Them niggas murking, they murking, young nigga put a little bit of church in
Put God above my purchase, been the martyr before I was birthed
They say that I'm too young to be out thugging
But I know it's in my blood, cause all these niggas my cousin
Might pop the gat if you budging, hating you gotta love them
Staging up out in public, making loud noise with the bullet
But fuck it, fuck it, niggas still hugging the block
Contraband stay tucked it my sock, coppa mans they loving the watch
Maybe cause it's [?] let us go, knowing that I'm out for my gold
Sold out shows across the globe until my story is told, nigga
