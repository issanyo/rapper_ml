[Verse 1:Nyck Caution]
I'll paint a portrait before intercoursin'
And I show her that she bout' to get it
And I ain’t kidding with no gimmicks
And if that’s what you had planned, girl
Cut it out, shit we high so you down like all of a sudden now, uh
Man you talkin, get yo larynx cracked
I’m doing fine, go and tell to Leon Marin that

Staring at a parent trap
The dutch split like a marriage in the century that we live
Show you how it feels as a kid
To be real like Madrid and never be defeated, uh
Case closed, I’m spending my pesos
Rules we break those, and me

Worthless women ain’t getting shit, yeah
So we circus flippin' all of these tricks, uh
Don’t trip babe, you could get it in the morning
It’s Nyck Caution, oh

[Verse 2:Nyck Caution]
Leaking venom out the veins when I’m cut
Insane and abrupt, different ways to destruct
We go and take the corpses in exchanging for bucks
Wipe my slate clean, what you think this cape mean?
Yeah I'll be your hero, platter full of cheese
And I ain’t gotta fear yo, I'm battling with ease
Got a kalik by her weave, and a pallet for the greens
So I’mma feed her grass, making calories decrease
What you think about me now? Recipes devoured my esthetic
Isn't down with enemies that empowered this bullshit, so rise
Flower of this garden
Bitch if you ain’t for it you a target, pardon my misdemeanor
Just receive what I’m giving you
Showing that I’m living proof that you can envision too
So don’t go on ridicule ‘cause we got precision with incision
So it’s likely that we killing you
Fucking dinner food
