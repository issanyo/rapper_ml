[Intro]
Yo
Yo
Yo It's Chuck Strangers

[Verse 1: Chuck Strangers]
And I got dreams of spendin' Euros off of music shit
Know it sounds like loser shit, but all the deep talk, niggas is used to it
I've been in Los Angeles paying off the damages
300 dollars say you ain't live yet
Plus I'm taking side bets 'cause the Uber driver ain't arrived yet
Watch me take it back to Prospect
Chiefing by the lake house for [?] though super fresh
Skinny niggas vexed and my box logo is a Double X
I am the wagon that carries the band
Threw my last three thou' with a name of Sandra Bland
On my project cover I'm staring like Sandra Bland
Got my MP & my blunt in my hand
Just tune in to the temple that God gave me, the god lately
Been goin' hard baby grinding but it's all gravey
Just trying to chop the vinyl to a Mercedes
And two ladies, one from Puerto Rico one from Haiti
Both fine, both dimes, need Knight time
It's Sunshine

[Chorus]
(Scratches)
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
It's Kirk
I'm so down to Earth I feel like I'm in grave danger
These boys in the Bush don't wanna see the mad ranger
In Europe starting a new chapter just hit the pager
Parkside boy on camera with the nice taper
I'll make you sick dressed up in this fly shit
Five thousand for the fit like Gump Forrest go dumb with it
Leave 'em at odds I'm dumb wicked in Barneys I'm cotton picking
In the field how I make my dirty denim
Jedi mind with the force in him
I feel the breeze when I soar, hawk vision
I see the hate from a mile away
Mad you ain't make the cut quick asking for the fade
QP wake-and-bakes put me in the stone age
Stop hating, get money for a change
And I ain't talking minimum wage
It's way more to game to stay paid
In fact I learned to be the jack-of-all-trades
Uh, and shouts to my nigga Jay
From my Parkside niggas 'round the way
Nothing left to say

[Chorus]
(Scratches)
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly

[Verse 3: Chuck Strangers]
And my crib was the trap house
Niggas ain't sell drugs, but niggas had drugs out
Wasn't no hits taken, but definitely gave hits out
Countless bitches got fucked right up on that blue couch
Whole crew rock Bape, pull up to the shit tipped
We all look kinda suave, cold inland on some chill shit
Looking at my phone curving bitches that you chill with
Went to Cal's party just to see what the deal is
Shit was wild like some [?] niggas but that's too Brooklyn
You gon' go over head, but all my niggas gonna feel what I said
A fake nigga only seeing his death, a thousand times
I felt the climate drop mine
I got this beat off [?] shit
Give a fuck if you caught shit 'cause the beat too brolic
She perked up and seen me come like a comet
Swear I shoved it in her mouth and almost made the bitch vomit
Word to me, I'm wild like Dean Street in '93
I smoked away my home training
And now I'm in the future just memory laning

[Chorus]
(Scratches)
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
All up to Brooklyn, shouts the whole scene
Pro Era represent, we staying fly
