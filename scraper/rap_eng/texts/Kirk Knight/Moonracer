[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
I sit inside of a furnace and burn up my demons
Loaded Lux with a loaded cup and I’m ready to clean it
Ethanol inside of my gal
When I spit it in battle raps
Making ash of your cataracts
You can tell ‘em you seen it
Cobain spitting cocaine with a wiff of that teen spirit
Whipping these mean lyrics like beans in a green Keurig
Even the fiends fear it this is new addiction
Big L, the new edition, in the Danger Zone with every listen
Look at The [Big]ger Picture
Kid gets so hot with every drop got teachers saving my signature
My signature move is to move you with every minute
Forget admission if the people don’t listen to every lyric
Listen a leer is the speed I’m moving within my movement
You better move it before I impede and leave you broodin’
A beast, I’m Brutus inside the booth I’m sleuth
When I locate your favorite emcee and then pull him out of his Coupe
By his neck and knot up a noose
Leave ‘em hanging up like a dap when I rap and wrap up the proof
Just proving that over loops you can’t forget improvement
You can’t win if you always losing
But you always will as long as Jay Diem making the music
[Bridge: Jay, Jom, Terry]
And I just sit all alone
Just me and these songs
Moonracer Im the king of this island
The king of this rhyming
[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Better prepare your bars
There’s a kid at large from the psycho ward
Tyke in a title fight like a Tyson brawl
In lightning form
So bring my idols on with a Tylenol for they broken jaws
And my fist in gauze
And im out of the box, I don’t need no ring
I sing these blues like I’m BB King
And I’m still 17 but I be the king
Who can tell me different
You fall in love with every listen
Island of MisFits
Satan would pray against this
But every goal gets shot at
Question is- would you feel the need to take a shot back
Cock back quick leave em wasted in lines
Till you realize the only thing you wasted is time
But every goal gets shot at
Question is- would you feel the need to take a shot back
Cock back quick leave em wasted in lines
Till you realize the only thing you wasted is time
Till you realize the only thing you wasted is time

Ye
[Kanye West]

Rap the new rock and roll
We culture
Rap is the new rock and roll
[Interviewer]

[Kanye]

Its been like that for a minute
We the new rock stars and I'm the biggest of all of them
