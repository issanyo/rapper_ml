[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Killuminati all through your body
Like a 12 gauge shotty

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
And I'm still a beast with these flows
Feeling real low my tree self esteem roll
We drowning out Atlantis can't overflow beast coast
Be more specific next time you shoutin' loud a-mi-go
I am not the star? In fact I plan it all
Fuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar
Please don't leave your comment if you are not up to par
No names, putting you in a verse that's too far
You're mundane can't obtain, the knowledge in my brain
My set told me light you up so this that propane
It's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame
No escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne
You set yourself up for that one mane. The king of New York?
Ha! we ain't just gon' let that one hang
Last nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zone
The rest of the real niggas is dead and gone

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ugh from the weak shit
That I hear, no lyrical style come near me
How they gon' try to compare me to what's clearly
Barely, not nearly as rare as me
Swank make hands fold like a rare disease
"How thou art write this? Yo, it's scaring me!"
I got all these rap niggas fucking fearing me
Heard they was looking for war but ain't declaring me
I'm well aware, NY not Delaware
I'm the real king fella here, you more like Prince of Bel-Air
I'm clearing the air, might fire at will
These rap niggas don't want the static for real
Cuz they lines not adjacent to my spectacular skill
If you don't fuck with cinematic stand still
My life's a movie on the real, you can get shot with your hands on the wheel
With your pants at ya heels

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them
But fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun
I’m God’s Son, I’m Pac, Guru all in one
I'm what they predicted before I come
In fact I do it all for them

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$]
Killuminati all through your body
Like a 12 gauge shotty

[Outro: Kirk Knight]
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the realest motherfucker alive
And I'm feeling like the, like the, like the
Killuminati, all through your, all through your, all through your

[Skit: Buckshot]
I love the competition
Go against the beast coast?
I retired that level of it
And now you have to deal with a brother like Joey
Which is a 45 magnum with a knife at the tip
And a shotgun at the end
