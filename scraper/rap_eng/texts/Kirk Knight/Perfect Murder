[Intro]
Caution been a killer ain't no chorus on this record
If you call me, leave a message
I ignore you, just forget it
Caution been a killer, ain't no chorus on this record, uh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, y'all mother fuckers know the name Nyckie
Already told y'all on that Stat shit
And just to set the record straight, I'm back with a passion
The game is fucked up but still got you somebody to punch hard
Got you running home, "Mom I got my ass kicked!"
Assassin in the flesh, the blade hid in the hood
Just came with it, keep me low in plain vision
It's been a minute but, I feel like I became vicious
Blake Griffin with the rock, Thanksgiving in the kitchen
I'm eating finally, yeah they got somebody to burn a body
Heard the lane is open, got me swerving like I'm Ricky Bobby
If you ain't first you last, all that I know
Murder competition, I'm Ivan Drago, I got the throttle
Push can't break if I try to, fate won't surprise you
You don't want a plate more than I do

[Hook]
Got a taste, hunger started lurking on me
Got my face covered like the burner on me
This a perfect murder, this a perfect murder (Yeah)
This a perfect murder, this a perfect murder
This is what you heard of, what you spread the word of
This is murder, this was known before you even read the verdict

[Verse 2]
Strictly business bitch I'm Eric Sermon
I stay real, it's no pressure why we act assertive
Watch how you act, things is strange and it's a shift, a curve
Eleven in my thoughts, in my mind I'm a different person
Or a different Monster, I'm a different breed
Listerine fresh, Ice cold rap, Mr. Freeze
Riddle me that, riddle this, I clown little kids
Two-faced Puppets Hush Nyck the Ventriloquist
Talking on the internet, I be looking at it like
"Who the fuck is that guy?"
You feel me right?
Nowadays everybody act like we really tight
But really you was never part of nothing (Yeah)
Got you in ya feelings, Now You starting something?
Coming for the kings and we aren't running
Come into the ring if you want the punches
I know it kinda stings once it started buzzing
Money ain't a thing, I don't count the numbers
Got it just to get me out from under
Do it, say it, beef, I fillet it
Speak, then portray it
Reach, elevate it
This ain't happen overnight, I pre-meditated
This is what you do when you follow Revelations
Fuck you and your life, and you follow demonstrations
I would never do that man, fuck them if they hate it
Fuck them if they hating, I don't give a-

[Hook]
Got a taste, hunger started lurking on me
Got my face covered like the burner on me
This a perfect murder, this a perfect murder
This a perfect murder, this a perfect murder
This is what you heard of, what you spread the word of
This is murder, this was known before you even read the verdict

[Outro]
This is what you heard of, what you spread the word of
This is murder
This is murder
This a perfect murder
