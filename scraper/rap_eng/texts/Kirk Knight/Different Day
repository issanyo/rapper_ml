[Intro]
Different day
I woke up this morning on some different shit

[Chorus]
Different day, different moves to make
Different pay, no room for mistakes
Different bae, different jewelry
It's okay, this ain’t new to me (Prrrm!)
Different day, different moves to make
Different pay, no room for mistakes
Different bae, different jewelry
It's okay, this ain't new to me

[Verse 1]
10 thousand on a chain, it cost me nothin’ (Nothin')
Joey gift a Rollie just for hustlin' (Hustlin')
Fuck girls for one night, they end up stalkin' (Stalkin')
I don't need to smile to show I'm flossin’ (Flossin’)
Life a movie, Paid in Full, it ain't no bargains (Bargains)
Three thousand for the kicks, you know I scuffed ’em
Pockets on Chris Griffin, got me cautious
Laughin' at you haters, see my tonsils

[Chorus]
Different day, different moves to make
Different pay, no room for mistakes
Different bae, different jewelry
It's okay, this ain't new to me (Prrrm!)
Different day, different moves to make
Different pay, no room for mistakes
Different bae, different jewelry
It’s okay, this ain't new to me

[Verse 2]
You shoppin' in the store, this right here cost me (Cost me)
Global Entry, I'm saucin' through customs (Customs)
One of one, I'm a narcissist (Narcissist)
Always gettin' active in the function (Function)
Boy, stop actin' in the function (Function)
Talkin' all that shit, but you do nothin' (Nothin')
Got a tolerance for hate, that shit is toxic (Toxic)
Dollar signs the only way you catch me talkin' (Talkin')

[Chorus]
Different day, different moves to make
Different pay, no room for mistakes
Different bae, different jewelry
It's okay, this ain't new, new, new
