(Hook 2x)
Check my style, check check check it out
Check my style, check check check it out

(Verse 1)
I say, Fuck the world, and fuck the system we live in
I step on the mic, and spit this shit Im thinkin
My thoughts make me this
I be cookin in the kitchen
Turn the faucet off it's cold water, hot Im switchin

I step on the mic and spit on the stereotypes
You haven't heard yet? play me on your stereo
Mics I yearned cuz I needed a voice, Yikes!
I learned how to write my rights and wrongs
In form of these songs, strike number three
Uh, I can do more now
Finna be free, fuck that! i wanna do shows now
Yeah I got that lyrical but need the beats to be profound
Got this beat from Pro Era, shoutout to that pro sound
Can I live? nineteen years old, Im grown now
Only getting older no time to chill I go now
Should I give? or should I take whats mine?
I know now, get out my way
Watch my train of thoughts explore now and

(Hook)
Check check check it out
Check my style check check check it out (2x)
I been on edge, at the cliff i guess I must be
Vivid and raw persona always...

(Verse 2)
I take this pen, dip it in my heart and paint a dark picture
When the ones that mess you up the most
They once was riding withcha
Got no highs, only lows
Yet they never come and getcha
When I make it out alive, just know
I won't forgetcha, though
Fuck it! I don't need that shit
Got my wings to carry on
I don't need that bitch
Ain't nobody beg and plead
I don't kneel that quick
If Im living in a box
Do I leave that shit?
All I wanted was time and space
A place to do rhymes to face
These trials and tribulations with grace
Cuz if I stumble off and fumble
Get stuck in it, a maze
I'll be jotting every sentence
Spitting every phrase

[Outro]
I been on edge, at the cliff I guess I must be
Vivid and raw, persona always dusty
Always on edge, at the cliff I guess I must be
Vivid and raw...
