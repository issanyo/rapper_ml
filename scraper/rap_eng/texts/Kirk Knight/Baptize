[Verse 1]
Yo
This the type of music make your momma cry
Homicide is on the rise, she pray you follow god
But we never follow instinct, just pressure from the elders
And our hope respect is building
Karma around the corner, hope I play the block correct
Live my life surfaced
The world is ours soon I'll have a slot with Katie Couric
60 minutes 'til I'm popping
Never get trapped up in no box, break the locks, now we locked in
Yeah, pause it, back when we lost it, can't record the time from slowing it down
A bigger time would keep the life in order
I'm trying to keep my fucking light in order
Cause bills are piling and I spend my life a night recorder
Ain't got that mustard, I contribute to it
But I know when I will pass upon this shit I'm probably still losing
Cause there's nothing worse than talent wasted
Is back to aiming through the roof and hope my ammo breaks in
Then I continue past it
I'm trying to issue classics
I'm trying to be the symbol that's gon' to keep your dream inactive
It won't be easy but with simple it doesn't even matter
From my organs to amino acids, I'm a fucking fiend for passion
'til I redeem and eat, sleep and just put repeat action in
'til I collapse, I'll be attached to lead the legal factives
'til Imma bleed and reach, peaks they always told me that I would never come close to, never let those choose
Yeah, and now it's everything I thought it could be
You thought me anything I thought I could be
Tears falling down my dad's eyes
I grew up, ya son baptized, cherish what we have
Life never promised, get it while it's possible
Because anything is solvable (true)
You told me do what you do
And believe in yourself, way I'm believing in you
Just believe in yourself or I believe it in you

[Outro]
And I swear to everything
When I leave this earth
It's gon' be on both feet
Never knees in the dirt
You can try to stop me, cuz when I leave it hurts, it's far
Just lived your life, twice for mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let my family grieve
At the funeral parlor tripping tears down they sleeves
Give me any amount of time, don't let my family cry
But I don't wanna die
I been baptized, yeah
Tears falling down my dad's eyes
I grew up, ya son baptized, cherish what we have
Life never promised, get it while it's possible
Because anything is solvable (true)
You told me do what you do
And believe in yourself, way I'm believing in you
