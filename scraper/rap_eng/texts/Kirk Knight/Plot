[Verse 1: Jon Carlo$]

I've been plotting my temple throbbing, shit we making music
All y'all niggas confused and
We starting a revolution
Get yo ass up and get ready to salute this
It's just crazy how Brenda got a baby, shout out my nigga $wavey
On this road to riches, but my vision is blurry
Tell my mom don't worry, it was mid February
When I got the news, she losing her job and there's nothing I can do
Now put yourself in my shoes, how can I pick and choose
From containing all my views, life's a bitch but I still refuse
To let myself down in this small ass town, I ain't holding no grudge
Who are you to judge? it's just me myself and I when it comes to love
Now let me get a hold of myself as I push against this shelf
Who the hell was gonna help, got a bottle of emotions
Stop with the commotion, cause I'm plotting
I'm with yo bitch and I just treat her like an auction

[Verse 2: Cameron $wavey]

Yeah..
Plotting on a bigger picture then most of these lil niggas
Still a lil nigga but I talk like I'm living off of six figures
Still a lil nigga but I'm rapping like Grammy award winners
Spitting fire like kindles nigga I body the instrumental
Abusing the pad and pencil, eraser burning, tips chipping
Life's a bitch but the pussy good so I ain't tripping
Flow unprecedented, flow impressing bitches
Flow gone get the dough so now I fuck with lesser niggas
Broke niggas talk a lot, hungry niggas talking lots
Cars, clothes, hoes and the money yeah I want a lot
Me and my team praying that we get it, all hands in
First place in this race for the money, Grand Prix
Bout this paper i'ma chaser tell the money keep growing
Won't stop till my wrist and my neck like a DQ Blizzard, they snowing
But for now it's low budget, still on this rap hustling, keep going
Write these drugs and hit the stu, me and my niggas keep flowing
Flowing for the dough and the chase for dough has no end
Racing on the road man, the road to the riches
Get it by any means, I'm sacrificing bitches for benjis
Get it by any means, I'm sacrificing bitches for Bent-leys
Copping every pair of jays the 1s, the 4s, the 5s, the 6s, the 7s, the 8s, the 9s and 10 3s
