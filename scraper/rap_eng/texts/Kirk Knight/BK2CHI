[Intro: Kirk Knight]
BK 2 Chi-town one time

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Choose your words wisely, what's your status?
Go it in the bag let me coach ya
I'm the type to change ya apparatus
Still my mentality is hostile
Still ride around with apostles
Slavin' for chains, I'm just breakin' the ice
Speakin' of for household name
Always on deck, my hand on that pussy
She lovin' the prodigist, follow the captain
I know this is painkilling time
That's a major hardship to go sell
Life for me been so damn crack
Went from a broke nigga to an addiction in fact
Losin' some friends I bordered that shit
Immune to the bull nigga, I'm a rogue cell
Fine by myself
Absorbin' the money, the power, the wealth
Never goin' to change
I'm just weighin' out the options
Fast life turn us to a monster
Takin' a break, I don't even break a sweat
Only break bread with my niggas
A select few, life is pushin' buttons, reap what we sow

[Bridge: Kirk Knight]
No telling locations, just keep it remote
Just keep it remote
No telling locations, just keep it remote
Just keep it remote

[Verse 2: Martin $ky]
Yeah, what the hell going on in my city?
I feel like the fuckin' coldest, none of you niggas can see me
On the board or the mic or this life shit
Been on the journey, niggas earned it so it's priceless
Hit my nigga Kirk up, said I wanna hurt these niggas feelings
He said, dawg I'm fuckin' with it, we the illest, nigga
Hit them with the nuke, got niggas feelin' scared at their round table
Mean is this division, fuck it if they didn't see it
Oh, boy got hits, I'mma pack out the venue
Niggas eatin', you see it, I been all through the menu
Remember talking about all this, swear this shit it was written, allow
Me to talk my shit now that I got your attention
Damn, rollin' up my medicine
Welcome to the club, if you slept now you woke
I should be giving niggas lettermans
Pushin' out the vibes in you let it in
You could be vibratin' on a different plane, I been better than
Blinds down, these niggas hidin' from the heat
I done made my own lane, now it's clouds in the street nigga
Auto when it stings, two eyes couldn't see
Spending all my last dollars on some shit I don't need
These vices, I'm addictin' to shinin' on these niggas
They been running out of styles and your boy got a lease
Middle finger up cause you niggas wouldn't win 'em
In the early days tryin' make a month out a week
Oh God, why the come and try to test a nigga patience?
All that shit is over, blowin' flames when I say shit
Even with the squad you ain't in the conversation
Knew I was the illest, I ain't wastin' time debatin'
Better than my last time, better than my last shit
Chilling with a spliff on my lap, tryin' to hack shit
Crackin' codes mobbin', we was on our all black shit
Know your fuckin' worth, told them niggas I ain't average

[Outro: Martin $ky]
I know you see it, I got it (Got it)
Turning my thoughts into profit (Profit)
Young nigga ain't have no options (Options)
I had to get this shit poppin' (Poppin')
I had to make me a lane in this bitch
Never sleepin', I'm workin' all day in the bitch
I know that they feel me all day with this shit
Had to make me some dollars, get paid for this shit (This shit)
Paid for this shit, paid for this shit
Paid for this shit, paid for this shit...
