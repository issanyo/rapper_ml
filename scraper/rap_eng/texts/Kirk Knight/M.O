[Verse 1]
I think I need Visine, been hopping off so many red eyes
Now kids look up to a nigga like a need a picture just to put on my head I-
So I stick and move, onto the bed I-
I am a person of interest, I think I need all of my cred, I-
But this here debit (This here debit), watch me flex it (Watch me flex)
As I exit (As I exit), just to kill (Always)
Lethal weapon (Lethal, lethal), with my whole gang (Whole)
You half-steppin' (You half-steppin')
Fuck girls with fingers 'round my throat like a necklace (Like a necklace)
I'm used to the cold my niggas, born in the trenches (In the trenches)
This that new Kirk, heat for the street, for my Mecca
Sharp tongue I talk that shit that leave you headless (Cut you headless)
You get the message (You get the message)

[Chorus]
You heard the memo (Heard the memo)
This my M.O. (This my M.O.)
This that I have been the shit since from the get-go
You heard the memo (You heard the memo)
This my M.O. (This my M.O.)
This that I have been the shit man, this that I have been the-
You heard the memo (You heard the memo)

[Verse 2]
Ugh, fly on the wall, I've been buggin' out (Damn)
Stop and chase, runnin' up bank accounts
Still down to earth, guess I'm underground
New school, but this ain't no cap and gown
Only L here that we pass around
Paint her face now she look like a class clown
Fronted before, but yes I would've passed out
Finger fuckin', now she looking for handouts
Took a flight, landed in Moscow
Haters stay watchin' they ass out
Jordan shoe boxes, a stash house
Livin' my life 'til I pass out
Can't fuck with you dawg, I'ma hell hound
You washed up and you let your mans drown
Slide on your block, it's a man down
Slide on your block I'm the man now

[Chorus]
You heard the memo, this my M.O
This that I have been the shit since from the get-go
You heard the memo, this my M.O
This that I have been the shit man, this that I have been the-
You heard the memo (You heard the memo)
This my M.O. (This my M.O.)
This that I have been the shit since from the get-go
You heard the memo (You heard the memo)
This my M.O. (This my M.O.)
This that I have been the shit man, this that I have been the-
