[Intro]
Kirk Kneezy on the beat (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Uh, yo, this is for Steelo and Micheal Gonzales
I swear to God I might just get that shit tatted
I'm stuck in the field like it's NFL Madden
I swear I need bands, I'm not talking no wagon
Back to Backwoods, you know my lungs are black
And I lamp at you niggas, you know it's Aladdin
Fly nigga, never caught with the baggage
Only thing you could catch me with is passion
I pop an E and then a nigga start gassin'
I'm already me without all of the tablets
You think I'm the joke? Last one laughin'
When you see Kirk, know that he cappin'
She lovin' the links, had a chain reaction
If she a dime, gotta bag 'em and tag 'em
My life been a movie, it's time for that action
I do it bigger than a nigga still mackin'
Dressed to kill, fashionably late
Hellhound sent from the Heaven's gates
She fucked me on camera, no Q&A
She on a pill, fuck me on a Perc
Poppin' at least more than two a day
Altar boy where I had gone and prayed
Back then I didn't have a clue in faith
Broke ass nigga, expensive taste

[Chorus]
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
See something nice, and I'm running that
See something nice, and I'm running that
Lately I feel like a running back
Lately I feel like a woo (Brr)
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
See something nice, and I'm running that
See something nice, and I'm running that
Lately I feel like a running back
Lately I feel like a running back

[Verse 2]
Her pussy was fat, had a heart attack
I'm a legend already, back on the map
Only pictures be Dee with the camera flash
St. Paul's born, I'm like Dapper Dan
Mama taught me always see the evil
Always give back to the hand that feeds you
When you gettin' that shine bring it to your people
Homies taught me how to be illegal
No second thoughts in the first place
16, took a flight on my birthday
17, moved into my first place
Me and Jozif overseas, we don't parlay
Searchin' for freaks to come party
In Selfridges, I'm thinkin' it's Barneys
Autographing the fans with the Sharpie
Mercedes-Benz on the car keys
I was bad at math, still counting these blessings
I'm in my bag like I'm drawing my weapon
My first thought, never coming in second
I'm fighting this gin off, you thought it was Tekken
Uh, heavy dose, been nodding off
Not an athlete but I gotta ball
Swear to God I'm the one to call

[Interlude: Rell Knoxx]
Aye yo Kirk, where the fuck you at boy?
Yo, get out the 'stu and come to this party nigga
I'm deadass boy
Yo, I just played your record
Shit goin' crazy, oh, this shit goin' up my nigga
I'm 'bout to run it back like four, five times nigga
It's lit, let's go!

[Chorus]
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a running back
See something nice, and I'm running that
See something nice, and I'm running that
I just told Rello to run it back
Lately I feel like a
