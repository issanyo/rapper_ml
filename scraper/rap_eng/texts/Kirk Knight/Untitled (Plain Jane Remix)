Hopping out tha ‘cedes
I ain't got no babies
I don’t do no drugs
Cause i ain't got no plug

I’m a good kid
Like sid the science kid
I be making A’s so ain't no time to get them aids

[1] I wear my polo like its Nike
I got all that ‘preme hi key
None of the girls like me
Cold like the Vikings

I hop out the lexus
Pay no mind to my exes
That’s why they exe’s
You know I live in texas

Everybody duckin
Call this shiz No Russian

Got the hammer and the sickle
I might be in a pickle
There blood gonna trickle
There watch made of nickel

I hit them 3’s like Kyrie
No one can drive by me
My shooters stay with me
Now they got to pick me

I don’t fight
Future to bright
Higher than a kite

We strapped with them sharpies
Park my flippin car please
Throw them the keys

Hopping out the beamer
Your baby girl beside me
Looks like she decided

My role model X
I drive that model X
Said i’m bigger than her ex
Upgraded to the X
Just hit ur ex
Shoutout to big Tex

Called me a brainiac
But i be a maniac
Report card back
Parents impressed
We call that success
So they bought me a rollie
No tick tock, just rolling

[2] We stay with them Ray Bans
I got my own band
We be making hella bands
Now we got are own brand

I don’t drive a 570
Only a p1
Lambo just for fun

The Rarri got a Glock
Already cocked
Just hit 2Pac
I am the killer
Blood spiller
Body tiller
Ghost face killers
Bigge was no trouble
Shut up and take the shovel
Make the body’s double

My backyard like a graveyard
Ain't no slaves in this yard
Only in the black car

Only protection i wear is tha bulletproof
Not that other vest
I always pass my test
Cooler than Johnny Test

No steps back only forward
Clear train of thought
No time for them whores
Don’t slam my benz door
Or you’ll be on the floor

Parents raised me right
Only because i'm white
