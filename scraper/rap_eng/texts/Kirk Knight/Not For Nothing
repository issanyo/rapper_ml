[Intro]
Oh shit, cut so many off to the point I cut my arm
Oh shit, cut so many off to the point I cut my, huh
Cut the bullshit, cut so many off to the point I cut my own wrist
And that's no bullshit
That's no
Hol' up

[Chorus]
I sense it's not enough
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for nothing
I sense it was the drugs
But most importantly that's just how I function
I never stayed in love
'Cause the ones that stayed, they was good for nothing
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for nothing

[Verse 1]
Cruisin' in my Honda and my mind will always wonder
How much more should a nigga gotta do for the come up?
I'm so in sync with my killer instinct
I'm a star now, shit I gotta keep my distance from shitty propositions
Same eyes, lookin' at me different
Oh, now you hungry, you need a taste of my living, huh?
But now it's gettin' too expensive for you
Talkin' under your breath, but now you say you kidding now?
Do I believe it?
I don't, so I'n bob and weavin'
'Cause the way they perceive me
Is nothing less of a genius and I mean it

[Chorus]
I sense it's not enough
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for nothing
I sense it was the drugs
But most importantly that's just how I function
I never stayed in love
'Cause the ones that stayed, they was good for nothing
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for nothing

[Verse 2]
Sleeping on them couches on Heart Street
Walk inside the crib, Platinum plaques, my new art piece
And what it cost me?
Time I can't get back with this lottery
Success is hauntin' me
Every purchase that I make are apologies
For the ones that taunted me
Doubted me so much, made me feel like it's a part of me

[Chorus]
I sense it's not enough
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for nothing
I sense it was the drugs
But most importantly that's just how I function
I never stayed in love
'Cause the ones that stayed, they was good for nothing
I sense it's not enough
But most importantly this here not for-
