(Verse-Cheech Petro)
You Ever loss a loved love one in your life?
Meditating its a joke but the scene ain't look nice see
First is the silence an then the cold eyes from the family then u know somebody just died
Its a tragedy the pain going insane inside
His presence just knowing he won't be alive
The essence wanting a few seconds
Asking God why but he don't answer questions
Preliminary sessions puffin with my brethrens
My Mission is so vivid blessing from the heavens
I can see it I can't grab it its gon take patience
Meanwhile im on vacation chopping with the Haitians
Insinuating my position packed with an ass of ammunition
Times ticking get my foot in and I ain't missing
Ain't none different still Tipping and Politicking
Tyler was my nigha i cnt tell you How I miss em
This shit kills me I be thinking how would life be
If he was alive to go outside shoot hoops smoke blunts do whatever we want
Pull bitches I remember that night we had to run
The scary stories witnessing Lakers beating the Spurs
By a second dawg that shit left you hectic no words
All the times that we had all the times that we fought
I dun shed so many tears trying to write this song
Im analyzing my mind organizing my thoughts
All the instances and incidents im just an awe
Ain't no coincidence pastors living like rappers and all
So i just get up and grind i know one day ima Ball
Its like the Apple dont fall to far from the tree
In Reality success is  all we can see
Some nighas get overwhelmed, some nighas are dead in Jail
Some nighas be posting bail,  Bt i just worrry bout Cheech
Homie Its Nothing Kicking Swank a lil too Pompous
Down In Augusta They Say That This The Brand New Compton
Flexing And Taunting Getting Paid However i want
We on a Rampage F1G ain't gon never be done believe that

I can only imagine. The pain that your family suffered  If nobody dont You know I Love Ya
I can only imagine
The Hardships Of Getting Over Growing Up Cousin Without Ya Brother.  I Can Only Imagine
The Pain that your family suffered if nobody dont you know i love ya. I Can Only Imagine
The Hardships Of Getting Over Growing Up Cousin Without Ya Brother. I Can Only Imagine
