Never put a boss bitch under pressure
Used to make bands selling grams out the dresser
Uh, now it's 20 for the tours nothing lesser
It's effortless bring your bitch I undress her then I finesse her/
Young D.O
Shit, you outta focus if you can't see it
The hustle smooth like the kitty I got your man eating
The city with me i feel it, nigga i can't leave it
A couple scratches and bruises you watching a champ beat it
I'm stampeding on these bitches claiming I ain't real
Like they idols daughters ain't pulling up to get high and chill
Like i ain't polly with wang or getting movie deals
Like i ain't twist out your mans gave him a coochie meal
Leaving niggas in the dirt like a footprint
New cribs, penthouse, BX to Brooklyn
If you a nigga from the past you the past
Boss bitch in them jimmy choos, trues on her ass

Its The Don

Work coming in every hour, uh
Hoes can never disrespect don ain't no coward, no
My shooters clean you up they giving showers, yeah
Sweet bitch but I'm only smoking sour, uh
Burnt a couple bridges and some bands for this brand
Coulda been some right hands now y'all some fans on the gram
Got a movie in my mind, kill auditions like god damn
Doorman know we high but he just sticking to the plan
Niggas claiming that they hit, they be lying on they dicks
Then be crying for a flick
I should run them through the clique
If it ain't nothing talking bout them dollars that's a dub
Still finesse the whole world real bitches they show me love

Chea
