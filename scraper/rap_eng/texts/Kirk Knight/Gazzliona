[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Guess who's back again
I'm known to make a fucker lose oxygen
I get sparked off intoxic drops of gin
Wait, stop, drop it in, roll over
Is what I told her, donâ€™t play games, I can't console her
Hand it over to the Pro like a controller
We overload her 'til she froze up, it was over
The Pros expose her, her ex propose her
They be like, "You ain't that hot", I know
But they still knock my door askin' 'bout Jay Hova
My witness, label me, not the Cohen
I got the sickness, hit this, get fixed with the quickness, right
Another J, J blow like dynamite
The other day, I was poor, dine I might
Had nothing but a empty appetite
Now I live a crazy emcee rapper life
Big tings ah gwan, top shotta
Kill it every show, rank's up like Shabba
Mr. Lover flow, hot off the top like lava though
I'm too hot, still skillet the pot
Turn bass metals into gold
They ain't think alchemy before I go
Yummy, let me wrap up my meat then explode
Who am I? The fiery Pro

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
The prime suspect, still the odd one out (GET 'EM!)
I might lose my mind, I might fuck your spouse (GET 'EM!)
Steal it, go and take it 'cause I need one now (YEE!)
Who am I? Keep an eye on, don't lose count
She said nothin' lasts forever, keep comin' back hun
Give me hot propulsion through 150 suns
The image in my mind brings the masterpieces
Make hot feces, I like my plate hot, feast
And my theory is, E.M.V, word to my J
My achilles is livin' in a world where MC's is
Mass affected, Poseidon of rap
I can see it all happened with the raps I spawned
Citizen but I guess y'all watch, (?)
Give me a glass but I mazel tov
And one balled too hard, such a star
The energy I give off, I run conEd
Still money in whatever wall it's in
It's hard to sin, with my contract, it's hard to sin
So who am I to shock therapy
Phonetic, panic, dangerous, show-off, act static
