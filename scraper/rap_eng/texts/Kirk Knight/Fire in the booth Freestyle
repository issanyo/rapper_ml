Instrumental 1: Redman -- "Tonight's Da Night"

[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Mic check yo yo
Its the Jozif Badman
PE, Brooklyn look Check me out huh

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
These niggas they ain't  ready for the war
Know all about them niggas, close you drawers
Please put your bread up
We ain't gon' settle for no iceberg lettuce
Let us eat when it's raw
Or end up like venison meat in the street
They're not ready for beef
Let the fish burn in the pot, niggas all in the spot
When it turns 12 'o clock then, we'll be servin' the block
Yo cut this shit
Cause I'm the best in the sector
Get your ear buds to grip, then I dissect ya
Inject ya with my lethal weapon
Plant a mine in the deeper sections guess who's least expect it
Motherfucker please respect it
The last one to pull my card was easily dealt with
You felt it this shit wreckers can't be reckoned with
On tracks wreckin' shit, ask me why I'm reckless
Break a wrist, approach my demo with a risk
Brought my demo listens, I'm a demolition specialist
I got the blueprints to the shit Jay to the O-
If blue was a prince I'm still Joseph Ko-
Know they can't ever little bro me
No matter how big they blow, they still a little below
It's the P-R-O E-R-A, indigo with the killer flow
Guaranteed the realest that you ever saw

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
We ain't done, no way to London
Your lung done
One next question son is where you from
From dust turn to dust and dust turn to O
Never was a rusty type so I'm just pure gold, stainless
Clean sheets good arrangements
Already made my bed and laid in it
Now I'm against the say in it
I said it best I pawn in this game of chess
I'm a King Luther my mind is my weapon
And I'ma respect the shooter kamikaze yo
Kam kamasutra please my nigga use your mendulla
I stay perfectiona-uh no dementia not to mention
I keep that shit sapiosexual still rough around my edges
Service that ask tweety bird is this your favorite cartoon to blast?
I lost my style cast away brace myself lime now
Who's wide shook but now I'm free at last
Now whats the problem now, no tape, no album out
These bad muthaphuckas they talked about

Instrumental 2: Mic Righteous -- "In A Gang"

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
I stand juxtaposed to all my Pro's, realest illest niggas I know
See these fool's bitin' the flows, they even jooks the pose
I guess my CD really shakin' the coast
Could this really be the year that I feast, capisce?
Nothin to feast, the beast, I speak my piece
No niggas in the streets that heat seek for me, release and squeeze
Might put a Halloween between your spleen
Retreat or trickle down to your last pound of green, know what I mean?
Shit it's like taking candy from the babies
All of these now rappers are a bunch of Now and Laters
They too sweet, plus they lease their Mercedes
Can't be second greatest, I'm the best and def your favorite
My flow in-depth nigga, I got my wave up
It's either get your tidal waved, or you could be my neighbor
Cause if I can't eat, you can't either
I need to know, need the pizza dough fuck I'm spittin' ether for?

[Verse 4: Kirk Knight]
Smoke a blunt as my palm to the face a quick change
I'm banking my shot spray the maces never read reverchi
Don't sell me dreams actin' like a fuckin' banshee
Understand me rock in my ears so you hear
What I'm dealin' with simplicity is key upon my simple shit
One sock on the foot, other on the mic pap filtered me from these
Please ride the dark knight
Try to smoke me and try to [?] in a room full of roaches
Watch how you approach me
Getting antsy lies out the pennies
Seem seventeen old enough for [?] Huh!

Instrumental 3: Biggie Smalls -- "Dead Wrong"

[Verse 5: Joey Bada$$]
Imma do it for my city on this one
You ain't running with the apes yet
Apex at the empire state neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Now that's a real, real, real mind fuck
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough
I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows till it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody no, no
I don't see nobody no, no

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight & Joey Bada$$]
I look at the world like Donnie Darko
The flow cuckoo and I don't really care
I don't chuckle I don't smile
No fuckin family no friends and no attire
I be up in the black timbo up that's entire
Your attire my mic is never tired
It never retire your time's expired and you's a liar
I punch liars through my punchlines with the choirs
Bitches sitting quiet cause I had her on desire
Yo, I guess it's time to watch this citizen
Just come off straight up off the block
And become that star that everybody watching
Catch me on the red carpet
To be a citizen, are you gonna really sit or stand?
See it in the end on CNN and Channel Five again
Try to come all the way for first place
But I can't relate your time slate comin' back huh
You plates gone I comin' through
Never mistake Don with Jig want
With the beat with the flow he enticing
These niggas never like them
Yes he's so enticing
All these motherfuckers don't like them

Instrumental 4: Paper Aeroplane ft. Splurgeboys -- "WTF"

[Verse 7: Kirk Knight & Joey Bada$$]
I blow more O's than your circus
No wild with the churches
You see us lurkin' and I never make a purchase
Put my god over that see me I'm a maverick
Chillin' with the maverick the sabertooth we at it
Back at it we rapping niggas on the radio spazzin'
To my radio waves can't get my wave lengths gotta get it back huh
Right here man oh bring it back
Throw it like a baseball bat
It don't really matter where you at
Baby girl come fuck in the back
If you fuck in the back then
I guess that its mac
And I guess it's mac and I guess that
I got two stacks in my Cadillac
In the black and I got the drop-top too
Double entendre
I keep that three stacks
In my pocket in my wallet
With the wildsack
I call my aunt Sandra
Where my laundry at?
These niggas getting washed I don't need no starter cap
Wall of sin and all the sins
All the sins in the world couldn't
Even repent against him
