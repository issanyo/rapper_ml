[Intro: Sun Ra]
Teleportation, transmolecularization, or better still—teleport the whole planet here through music

[Hook (x8)]
I hit the ground and start running

[Verse 1]
Crash land and hit the ground
So hard, I hardly speak
No talking bout my origin
Leading my hunger like Victor Orban
If all of my acts of kindness are unseen
Being the light at the end of the tunnel
Beam me up, Scotty
Parallel next to a dream
Watch me fly back to  orbit
What I do is not done
Look how far I've come
I'm never looking back
Look at where my eyes can see
I'm in a rush against time
To add my legend to the map and see
These bars are guillotine
Like a synth in perfect key
Locked down by the king
Get out of my system with no assistance
We as individuals
Always pitch with pinnacles
It's not rap no more
This that negro, fucking spiritual
That astrophysical
In that instance stars are born
With that instinct
We just press the mic record
And let it run... and let it run
Let that shit run
I'm on check like Venus and Flytrap
It's funk, you will feel that after dark pack
If you ever smoke like me and that's a fact
I hit it running

[Hook (x3)]
I hit the ground and start running

[Bridge]
Don't ever look at evils
Just get back at your people
Sometimes villains are the heroes
Sometimes the heroes are the zeroes
Don't trust no one (don't trust no one)
Don't listen to no one (don't listen to no one)
Don't let life pass you by (pass you by)
Just trust your gut, it's all you got
Don't trust no one (don't trust no one)
Don't listen to no one (don't listen to no one)
Don't let life pass you by (pass you by)
Just trust your gut, it's all you got

[Hook (x8)]
I hit the ground and start running

[Outro: Sun Ra]
The music is different here, the vibrations are different, not like planet earth. Planet earth sound of guns, anger, frustration. There was no one to talk to on planet earth who understand. Equation wise, the first thing to do is to consider time as officially ended. We work on the other side of time…
