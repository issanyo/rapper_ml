[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Understand I spit a venomous rhythm
Not a veteran yet
But my pedal to the metal
Revin' up the engine
So dont get offended
When I zoom past ya'
Put numbers on the board
Blake Griffin break
Take every thing you got
When they play you like a little kid
When they hostile what does being civil get?
So dont tell me to chill
Dont talk to me about no bullshit
Cause thats what these mothafuckas be selling me still
I am forever rebuilt
Went from touring around the country to remembering chill
Surprises I get about my memory field
With an image its supposed to be an era we build
But its never been the same
Got a vision we can buy a spot on Beverly Hills
Load a budget and our pockets full of celery still
Commerce commas they teasing, I was coppin' a feel
Then they disappeared fatherless
Falling feel bottomless
Now im here and now is Pro Era
Middle finger straight to the politics
Time to make a shift
Restore reminisce never feel hollow
Start a genesis
Phil Collins still rock it
I know that we're gonna get it all back
Probably better than the first time
Let me get the words right
I promise we are gonna get it all back
Way better than the first time
And I put it on my life

[Justine Skye & Nyck Caution]:
I put that on my life (Repeat x4)
Sacrifice
Who the fuck you are
For who you wanna be
Tell me where you at
Where you really want to be
I just want to be
I just want to be
Free


[Bridge: Justine Skye]
I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be free (Repeat x2)

Free, free (Oh)

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
At times so persistent
I choose rise
Realize first instinct
See the truth lies behind the scrutinized
Could I be more precise?
My soul ain’t got a price
Only thing sacrificed is my regular life
Just because Im gettin' by now I’m gettin' crucified
Probably what I get for thinkin like am Jesus Christ
But I swear we just alike, in fact I'm on my third life
Know my second coming, saw that from my third sight
Plus last time I checked I swear I walked on that ice
Hard flows like liquors frozen
The kid is sick and then born
In a district four, in an always rained on apartment
Got to know the only thing them April showers show
It's time to grow, if the seasons come and go
People leavin' for them reasons that you never know
Heaven sent for their souls
Heavens no! It’s another episode
Ain’t on the same page, in fact I'm on the epilogue
I’m so epic though, heard I'm getting epic dough
Now I’m getting off the high powers in the stepping stones
That a mic check just demean the microphone
Now I need me some cream just to make it back home
I never neglect and I never regret
Never lookin back in retrospect on what I could get
What I forget?
‘Cause If you snooze you lose, coulda, shoulda, woulda, but you didn’t come through
True
I never say that I lose cause when I lose I’m wise
And when I win I’m happy just for that moment in time
So check the rhyme, please peep the message
I do it for the least effort, you can keep the method
Move for your mental, you should bite this
Chew it with the dental
Let your readers digest x4
Take one to the brain, take two to the chest
Let your readers digest x2
Can't die just yet
I put that on my life


[Justine Skye & Joey Bada$$]:
I put that on my life (Repeat x4)
Sacrifice
Who the fuck you are
Who you wanna be
Tell me where you at
Where you really want to be
I just want to be free
