[Verse 1:Joey Bada$$:]

Its the real
Yo yo yo
Sleepy flow
What it do, what it is
Let me talk to em
Let me get it with the kid
One time, one time for your mind
Yo
I keep a nine mm in my ahem
By my cerebellum yo
Let me clear my throat again
The flow felon
Sleep is the cousin of death, i tellem
I take a breath then i rest my head
A yo im already dead
And thats the fact of it all
Youll be in awe just but how factual it is
Huh
A ghost in my mirror couldn't see it more clearer
One day your hear next day you disappear
My six sense start tin-galling when theres a, feeling in the air
Get out the bed yo, theres dead people there
Super nature, see them through mother eye
Father time end up living me
Wondering why
The universal mind is just so controversial
Beware the light in sockets, if you blind it hurts you
The power from within is so divine
So why would i even think about this line
Huh
Gather roun, gather round
This is for my niggas who be holding it down

Im something like the chairman of the board
Ranting
I feel, invincible like McMahon
One of the last original emcees thats left standing on the planet
Strike like a meteor do, remedial damage dammit
Cats can't stand it, get they ass handed and branded
By the lyrical new york city bandit
True warrior like Rembrandt
Yo some cats claim they fly but really be landed
I really can't stand it
Huh
Let me take a seat, this a Rosa Park her bum
Now make some room for me
PE in your _____ leave a message and weep
Old hoes call me now, leave a message at the beep
I dont want to speak, baby i dont want to speak
I just wanna be, please let me be

Mother earth knows im naughty by nature
Calling my women queen
