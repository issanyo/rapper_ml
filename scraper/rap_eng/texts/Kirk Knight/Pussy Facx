[Intro]
Uhn, Yeah
It's another one, nother one
It's another one, nother one hits
It's another one, nother one
Uhn, Yeah
You ever get tired of that shit man like
You're everything I want and I need
But I just don't trust yo ass
You eeevol!
I don't trust you baby

[Verse 1]
Yo
Baby girl what the fuck am I supposed to do
I'm not sorry that I can't be true
A power you, shock me too
When I pull the plug
Elect the divine
You heaven sent & you godly too
No strings attached
What you said
When I was pullin' on the g-string
& you were just giving me head
But instead, fuckin' out here disgracein' me
Playin' me, you out here chasin' me
Our chemistry
Is charm, word is bond
It would last, breaking bad
But it's out of the charm, you holdin' my arm
Tryna go far
But you got tendencies
Like a maid, making sure your man is up to par
I got a grip as a shooting star
I would board your body but it's truly scarred
By them other dicks
But what I think is
You kinder than shit, in context
You my type a bitch
You my type a bitch

[Hook]
You my type a bitch
I don't trust you that much
You be suckin' niggas off
But you my type a bitch
You my type a bitch
You my type a bitch
You my type a bitch
You be suckin' niggas off
I don't trust you that much
But you my type a bitch
You my type a bitch
Beautiful
I don't trust ya
But ya everything I like
You got me paranoid in the head
You got me paranoid in the head
Beautiful
I don't trust ya
But ya everything I like
You got me paranoid in the head
You got me paranoid in the head
You got me paranoid
You got me paranoid

[Verse 2]

I know you screamin' that you hate the fact
& my faith to you is just act
You test my love
You my drug
Just want a menage or a late night skeet
No facade, get high
Reach the sky with her
But ain't no trust
Cuz this is just a fuck
& you think im scum
& you say im young
Say I don't know what a relationship is
Just how wet the clit is
Shit, get out my business
I like my own space
Said I like ya but you play it cool
Hold me down, when I need a boo
& Un-need-able
& I don't need a boo
& You say im wack
But you love it when I hit it from the back
& to that changes, fatal attraction
You hate me & I hate you
I love you foo, I love you boo
Cuz you my type of bitch
