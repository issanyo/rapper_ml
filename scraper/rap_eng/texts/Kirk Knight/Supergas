[Verse 1- Charlie Haylee]
Well Suicide is painless, so I'm about to aim this
Gun I steal from daddy, see me brandishing the stainless
I'm aimless, with nowhere to go
I've reached a new low, on their face see the glow
Wish this taste I could blow, away with this pistol
Cause it's the taste of despair and it hits like a missile
Because quick dismissal, is all I expect
If i defy my common sense, and do send that text
To someone who's simply better than me
Perfect life, perfect girl, perfect family
How can it be, that their lives are all so fucking great
Catch me staring at 'em, skipping stones across the lake
Wind in my eyes, qnd my eyes on her thighs
Fast she turns in surprise, as I suddenly crack
Take your subtlety back
Keep the knife in my pocket, Grey Goose in the sack
Drink before I attack
And for all these backstabbers, I'll be stabbing them back

[Hook- Joey Bada$$]
She left and broke my heart like twice
(twice twice twice twice)
Now everything is dark and it's fucking up my life
(life life life)
And I just wanna make it right
(right right right)
But I won't make it through the night
(night night night)

[Verse 2- CharlieHaylee]
Na never mind, who the fuck I'm kidding
I'm bout as violent as Betty, White kid just sitting
On the edge of his chair, run his hands through his hair
And see her do the same, dreams filled with her name
And he's the only to blame, Cause all he is, is a lame
About to go insane, train coming
And If she says no, in front of it he'll be jumping
Bass thumping, out the loudspeakers
The whole crowd pumping, but he's staring at his sneakers
Sitting in the corner, anger coursing through his veins
He could never kill himself, there's just nothing to gain
Except for fame, and rampant notoriety
For the one who couldn't fit into society
Lie to me, tell me that I'm not as fucked up as I think I am
Maybe we're all the same, all eggs in the frying pan
That is this cruel, cruel world
With it's fucked up guys, and it's fucked up girls
Supergas and skinny ties, lies
This is the shit that goes through my head
When I'm staring at the ceiling, laying in bed
And since the ninth grade, I could never sleep at night
I can only pray for hope and hold my covers tight
