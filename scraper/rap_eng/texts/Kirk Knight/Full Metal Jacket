[Chorus]
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Drip, drippin' from the gauntlet
Drip, drippin' from the gauntlet
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet

[Verse 1]
Remember when people banked on my misfortune
Money's still callin', pick up man it's urgent
Stuck in the cut like your boy was a surgeon
Can't take advice, I'm allergic
Any permission slips, yeah, I just forge it
Knewin' my momma couldn't afford it
In my mind, it cost a little extortion
Knew what time it is, I had to stop watchin'
Only food if you don't figure your portion
Introverted 'cause I don't do the gossip
Caught a grip, I gotta make me a profit
Sleep on the benches and beds with the monsters
Sit straight, my nigga, good posture
I'm tired of grievin' and starvin'
I need to eat 'til I'm lethargic
Fuck the world, I'm Mr. Marcus

[Chorus]
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Used to take shit to heart, nowadays real heartless
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet
Drip, drippin' from the gauntlet
Drip, drippin' from the gauntlet
All my blood, sweat, and tears
You can see that shit drippin' from the gauntlet

[Bridge]
I been contemplatin'
I been steady waitin'
I been contemplatin'
I been steady waitin', yeah
I became so heartless
I became so heartless

[Outro]
Full Metal Jacket (Full Metal Jacket)
I'm Stanley Kubrick (I'm Stanley Kubrick)
A nigga been heartless (A nigga been heartless)
Don't make me prove it (Don't make me prove it)
Just sippin' the Activis
Now I'm the new Huey Newton (New Huey Newton)
See so much pain in these eyes, I think it be stainin' my pupils
Full Metal Jacket (Full Metal Jacket)
I'm Stanley Kubrick (I'm Stanley Kubrick)
A nigga been heartless (A nigga been heartless)
Don't make me prove it (Don't make me prove it)
Just sippin' the Activis
Now I'm the new Huey Newton (New Huey Newton)
See so much pain in these eyes, I think it be stainin' my pupils
