[Intro: TheMIND]
What if we are shadows
Like versions of ourselves
What if we fight battles
Sail the waves looking for something else
When you dream, do you dream in colors
You see the world for what it is
Empty space, in this time, I'll be fine (If I, If I)
Go back to the future

[Hook: TheMIND]
Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Benevolent and heaven scented
How I was born onto earth
Adversary, a provider from God
It’s already scary and gentrified
Before I even grown to be 20
Blessings of adolescence
I made before, fine dimes and pretty pennies
Always putting my two cents in
So a nigga always watch what they say
But on the contrary, a nigga just see what the blend is
Feeding me happiness through a straw
Commissary blessings
But that ain't enough to boost for what I'm going through
Childhood friends passing away like fresh morning dew
Every day my mind is laced, strapped up
Protection on waists of Rugrats
Tryna find angelic sounds in this place
We shot for the stars, and we ended up with more case of color blue
Same shade as the pill I'm now forced to take
Screaming lord, take the wheel, hit the emergency brake
Never stop, voices in my head
And I hear them say

[Hook: theMIND]
Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
If time is of the essence
Type to take it out of context
Conflicts with imaginary enemies
I give cold stares, walking everything that illuminates fear
Battle you with myself
Stop trusting every help
As the lunatic
And they pray that the night fall
Even the clock got his hand together
Shade night a slave to [?]
I’m used to the music
Foot soldier on the beat street
Hoping I don't lose it, tho
Need your time of day
With the time nigga, I prove it back
Me in this fourth corner, poverty stricken solution
Mind reaching as high as pollution
Roaming as these ruins
Out of shape with this hex on me
And nowadays, I ain't feeling blessed homie
Showing you all my hands
Nothing on my person tell you ima bluff
Even on my last breath
Even when I'm out of luck
Even when my dreams stall
Even when my time is up
Screaming..

[Hook: TheMIND]
Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future

Seen it all, done it all, rise and fall
Ima still be here in the future
