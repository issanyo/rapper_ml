[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy]
Get it
Aye, this that fire shit
That spitting through that wire shit
That king, call me sire shit
Yeah, yeah
It’s gonna be some rough times
It’s gonna be some love times
Gonna be some hate times
Never will you take mine

[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I seen it all but the birth for my seeds
Too much purple man it hurt when I breathe
I’m tryna surf through the sea
Can’t swim but I roll through the deep
You know, Twelvyy wrote the code to the streets
I do this shit for the G's
I’m in the P'z pouring hennys for Steve
Lighting L's for Steez, it’s hard to tell
When your physical leave
I’m in the passenger, talking to my bitch by the massacre
Kill the game, then we move to Africa
There’s 47 shoots from my Brooklyn confidant
All my hitters nonchalant, quick to change your ambiance
I’m from Castle, hail savage with the battle tales
Average with the baddest [?] status make you made as hell
I'm a dragon with passion of a Samuel, Jackson with the strap
And yeah, I'm packin' if you couldn't tell
Catch you lackin' 'bout that action if you couldn't tell
Wish you well, now a nigga blacker [?]

[Hook: Chauncy Sherod]
I said, it's gonna be some rough times
But I'll be alright
Got this bottle full of sunshine
To warm me through the night
I'll be alright, be
Yes I will, I'll be alright
I'll be alright

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Born from the trenches, hotter than these bomb shells
Coated arm, Larry Hench and Bond and with these living tissues
Not doing well, knee deep in the situation
Needed so they [?] very well
Preaching that this park side, nigga made me believe to something to eat
Peter Pan always dishing out flavors for all the streets
Always respecting the elder, but never give up the seat
And life is but a tightrope, will remain full of petite
Balancing with desferal, call that Ying Yang Twin
And get chemically imbalanced when the kid starts spitting
That's the full bitten, when the price is right, we sell a dream
We was born on the rocks star, intoxicated [?]
Off the scene, wasted all the time tryna find our life
Thought the scenes of Robin life
Tryna find drug abused knees, something to lean on
So nigga, I'm just gon' keep on
Pushing like the birth of newborns
While others miss-carry the message that a nigga grew on
Thought they woke up, nigga, false alarm, we snoozed on
The grass is greener on the other side
Lord of the Flies end of the innocence
I call smell in the air, PH proof on
This for Steve, this for STEEZ
Don't forget Junior B, nigga

[Hook]
I said, it's gonna be some rough times
But I'll be alright
Got this bottle full of sunshine
To warm me through the night
I'll be alright, be
Yes I will, I'll be alright
I'll be alright
