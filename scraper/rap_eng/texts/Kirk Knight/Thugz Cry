[Pre-Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, just wanna be
I just wanna be, just wanna be

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Maybe I'm just like my brother
He's never satisfied
Why do we shoot up each other?
This is what it sounds like, when the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah (I just wanna be, just wanna be)

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$ & Kirk Knight]
I can't explain the pain (oh no) all I know is chains (oh yeah)
All I know is whips, and all I know is gang gang gang (gang gang gang)
Don't even know my name, and the place from what you came (ooh)
Niggas love to talk, but niggas never change (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Same thing, same faces on the news, this is nothin' new
This is what we knew, we still hangin' by the noose
It's written in the proof, time to face the truth (no no)
Niggas never wanna execute, niggas only make excuse

[Pre-Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, just wanna be
I just wanna be, just wanna be

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$ & Raury]
Maybe I'm just like my brother (maybe I'm just like my brother)
He's never satisfied (he's never satisfied)
Why do we shoot up each other? (Why do we do, why do we do?)
This is what it sounds like, when the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Welcome to the high plane, I'm so fly
Won't say my designer's name, know why?
Broke gunners in the wing, shit ain't been the same
Now we honor Jenner, James and the ring
Sweet Jesus
I pray for you non-believers
They say that you never see us
Turn around, sing "Pledge of Allegiance"
Nothin' went with this world
What are we to do with the story?
They gotta never witness your true ways
Better play victims or new slaves
What the hell is with them kids these days?
Get ya guns, the guerillas gon' bang
Treat us like animals in this race
Put that banana clip in your face
'Til you wash all their problems away
I don't plan on doin' laundry today
What's 50 bands to a man like me?
There's this but your whole life just trynna pay the shit back
Can't you see or is you blind?
Screen advertise corrupt your mind
Fill that TVs with so many lies
So many die overtime, hold so many lies, uh

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$ & Raury]
Maybe I'm just like my brother (maybe I'm just like my brother)
He's never satisfied (he's never satisfied)
Why do we shoot up each other? (Why do we do, why do we do?)
This is what it sounds like, when the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah
When the thugs cry, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be, I just wanna be
I just wanna be
I just wanna be free, yeah
I just wanna be, just wanna be
I just wanna be, just wanna be

[Outro: Kirk Knight]
No law, no law
Ohh Lord, ohh Lord
