[Intro: Rokamouth]
Beastcoast, Ya Kna ?
Beastcoast Animal, we are the super Pro's
Beastcoast Animal, we are the super Pro's
Beastcoast Animal, we are the super Pro's
Beastcoast Animal, we are the super Pro's

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I got her in a cobra clutch, she choke it up
Beastcoast baby, I'm an animal, you know what's up
And I don't mean to sound like a dickhead
But I supply the drinks so I already got her lips wet, so sip that
I can make the other two drip sweat
Forgettin' is a sin when the lick start settin' in
You can light a lickle spliff, if you wit it
Don't try to play dirty, it's better if you bring a friend

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
I'm the nigga that your bitch rolled and she don't wanna switch lanes
Take a lick 'till you make the main vein drip
Rub-a-dub-dub, I'm not a player I just crush alot
Queen Latifah: Are you gonna pass the dutch or not ?
Blood clots from smoking with jamaican girls
She so curvy, curve me, know it's Dirty
I'm not cleanin' up any time soon, do me a favor
Climb it boo, it's hot and you're thirsty

[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
Man, let me tell you 'bout this girl named rachel
She had a dinosaur smile plus had had the cakey
She said she love Apex but I was never with the fitness
Survival of the fittest, King of the spits like queen of the licks
Keep me lifted, I don't need a wingman
She wanted to be the number one, wait...hold on, suppose to
I'm supposed to hit it once like a monsoon

[Verse 4: Rokamouth]
I keep these girls in check
Remind em' what I do when I'm kissin down they neck
Better not go and hit my phone if I left
Or I'm on to the next, Bustin' cheeks when I flex
Shawty got vexed when I leaked on her dressed
But Roka makes it up when my lips on her breast
Little mama shiver, I be licking down her chest
I Ain't even do my best cause I'm giving her the rest

[Verse 5: Chuck Strangers]
Uh.......
And this a song about bitches
She go up and down like alpine switches
She had more L's than the New York Knickses
Screamin' fuck your schwap, this shit here prescription
Uh, and the pussy had me trippin
Call me Faja, when I hit it like the dutch
She was splitted, never call after I tear it down
Stole her loud
Now we crusin' while you losin' on the way to Dirty house

[Verse 6: NYCk Caution]
Dirty Hoes in they flirty clothes
They give me nerdy dome
Say they got a man but it really don't concern me though
Why you think you got that title for ?
You say that you not a whore
Why am I slapping on your spinal cord ?
Me and her converse, slippin' off my converse
Bandit with the bars, you should listen to this Con's verse
STD won't infect me, I wrap it up when I'm in it
Straight rip up the kitten

[Verse 7: CJ Fly]
I got a few sumchins, I think we got some chance
I never had a russian but she always goin' cum fast
I told her give it to me
She sent it, I smelled it
I hope she don't think this won't damage are friendship
I went in, now it's time to get out
I told her come to my house to show her what I'm about
Little do she know that I heard she was a ho
And I got word of mouth that she go down south

[Verse 8: Joey Bada$$]
Aye yo shawty, come toke this bud
It's the smokers club
She scoped the bus and got so stoked it's us
I'm done talking, spoke enough
Just hope to bust
I won't poke at love I'm a focused thug
Step into my office
Groupie broads can't keep of us
Only thing offered is major label offers
Cause I ain't with selling my soul and my sound
For some pounds and that pretty brown round

[Verse 9: Capital STEEZ]
Girl, lemme entertain your yin and yang
Or i'll dig my fangs in between your frame
If you really into kissing games
You're a fan of my masculine balance
Acrobats of unmasking your talents
Astrosex doesn't count if you doubt it
But I bet you can't wait to find out yet
Your blouse is closer than my house front
And a dime doesn't cost what an ounce does

[Verse 10: Joey Bada$$]
Sweet mother of pearls, and diamonds
Everything was perfect but the timing
From the underworld, came the young minor
Mining his own gold, finding his own soul
Ho try to make me fold, bitch play your own role
Ho's profound cause what the pro found
I been charming princess but you get no crown
And cause what a nigga blow down, so loud
It's funny gettin' high cause them chickens so down
