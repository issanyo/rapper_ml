[Intro]
Talk back to me
Even if you talk back to me
Yeah

[Chorus]
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Fell to my knees, I've been feelin' so weak
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
I can't believe that the stress gettin' to me
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime

[Verse 1]
Confidence, lost it
Prisoner, I'm held hostage
By self-doubt, I get lost and
You wasn't there on the prospect
Mind your business on the parkside, nigga
All the small talk just to get bigger
In my soul, I got to make figures
Fire in my heart, it get lit up
Party hardly, but yeah I'm the plug
Big OG homie, show me love
Wild lifestyle, hope I keep up, I can feel success in my blood
But bad company got me stuck, lately feel like sticks in the mud
Shrooms mixed with sixth of the mud, never satisfied with love

[Chorus]
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Fell to my knees, I've been feelin' so weak
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
I can't believe that the stress gettin' to me
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime

[Verse 2]
Smoke more than I eat
Head's in the clouds, still think on my feet
I'm just trying to find what I'm destined to be
But every time I find things testing me
Like momma need money, I spend it all on the rent
Lately my pockets look funny, I body these shows
Never showboat, I just roll, homies see me across the globe
Having talks to myself, happiness, health is your wealth
Any else under my belt, stains on the couch
She made the best of my time, make sure my lyrics are felt
Against all the odds, even when I'm at my prime
I know my skill is top shelf, I was askin' for help
Niggas just kept to themselves, jealousy right here and I could tell
Not my dawg, nigga you go to hell
Used to get pennies for my thoughts, been wishin' well
Now I get thousands, I'm stackin', just tipped the scale
I've been connectin' the dots, like I'm readin' braille
Percs got me trippin', you know I ain't kidding now
Came up from nothin', of course I just held it down
Every night I was just sleeping up on the couch
Had to check niggas, I knew they was out of bounds
Givin' cold shoulders, how my friendships simmered down
Time is money so I made every second count
Living the fast life, but been trippin', been in and out
I wanna cop two chains and match up the big amount
But before anything

[Chorus]
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Fell to my knees, I've been feelin' so weak
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
Rolled up the weed, I was depressed for some weeks
And I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime, yeah
I can't believe that the stress gettin' to me
Man, I swear I need
I swear I need some downtime

[Outro]
I swear I need some downtime
I swear I need some downtime
I swear I need some downtime
