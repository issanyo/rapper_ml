[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Yeah, my mentality is hostile
12 and I'm riding with Apostles
Beast Coast, nigga can't stop us
Henny straight blocking my chakras
This is but a dream, life is not what it seems
Seems like you gotta make a cut or get cut up
Or get cut by greed and jealously
Now you see, keep it supreme what you waiting for
Being that we are perfect entities
Before you steal my identity, then the end of me
Behind these lines, I'm trapped in my mind, forever B
Forever bein the lion's nest and you'll just probably just see

[Bridge 1: Kirk Knight]
In a nutshell we steal nutshells
From women not up to par but
Partly I kill every universe till I reach Stars
Starring at us present present day we still at fucking war
So my mom pick up the cases, don't judge me when shots go off

[Chorus: Kirk Knight]
Im screaming who want war nigga
They dont want that war
Im screaming who want war nigga
They dont want that war
Im screaming who want war nigga
They dont want that war
Im screaming who want war nigga
They dont want that war

[Bridge 2: Kirk Knight]
Shit your articles of clothing was an issue
With these magazine niggas talking shit, I'll load a full clip
Never face Defeat, but word up in the streets
We ain't free, don't sell me dreams
You ain't know that talk is cheap

[Verse 2: Dyemond Lewis]
Kirk be the nigga with problems
We gonna call Prob up, he gonna handle the problems
Vodka blocking my chakras
Bumping that Flying Lo and TOKiMONSTA
Ahh I gotcha
We superior beings, you seen how I been
Been living on clouds but this ain't no dream
Been riding on nimbus I'm out for the spinach
My bitch didn't like it then fuck you, good riddance
It's hard to stay sane in a world full of sinning
But, see, all I got is my niggas
Kreeper and Slacka, you know we mean business
Fucking gods on earth build and destroy it, our will is our turf
So don't get murked
Step through the door, you know feelings get hurt

[Bridge 1: Kirk Knight]
In a nutshell we steal nutshells
From women not up to par but
Partly I kill every universe till I reach Stars
Starring at us present present day we still at fucking war
So my mom pick up the cases, don't judge me when shots go off

[Chorus: Kirk Knight]
Im screaming who want war nigga
They dont want that war

[Bridge 2: Kirk Knight]
Shit your articles of clothing was an issue
With these magazine niggas talking shit, I'll load a full clip
Never face Defeat, but word up in the streets
We ain't free, don't sell me dreams
You ain't know that talk is cheap
