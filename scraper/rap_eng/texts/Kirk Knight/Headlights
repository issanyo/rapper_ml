[Chorus]
Deer in the headlights
You know we can't stop, right?
Blowing money out the window
Living life bilingual
A deer in the headlights
You know we can't stop, right?
You know we can't stop, right?
You know we can't stop, right?

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Wake up in the morning, that's a new mood
W-wait, wake up in the morning, that's a new new
W-wait, wake up in the morning, I'm feeling confused
Just a good son stuck in a family feud
Life's a bitch and father don't got no time for me
But I'm on the clock, steady patient, know my time's coming
Never miss, gunning for the top like I'm head hunting
So name your price, kill anything for this empty stomach
A new friend, I welcome a new enemy
Why I see the smile, always feel the fake energy?
Why I gotta text back niggas? I'm busy mentally
Why you look at my dreads and see another felony?
Why I preach cuh but relapse bad tendencies?
Why some of my childhood friends feed jealousy?
I guessed this the road that I asked for
Crash course, keep a bible on that dashboard

[Chorus]
Deer in the headlights
You know we can't stop, right?
Blowing money out the window
Living life bilingual
A deer in the headlights
You know we can't stop, right?
You know we can't stop, right?
You know we can't stop, right?

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Parkside, carry razors in my SBs
Just in case the law wanna test me
I need a paper, multiple choice, how to get the fetty
But the big homie said a nigga wasn't ready
Never overlook the underworld
Besides diamonds and pearls
Addictions sketchy women
Killers that's real life vicious
Stab your moms in the kitchen
And tell her son do the dishes
I know it's fucked how we get the riches
Still with spaceships, fuck bitches
Anybody fuck with us? Burn bridges
Account numbers not mine, still hitting
So don't forget, niggas would die for your position
So go and make the crack to keep us dope boys listening
The beast heat rock, you can go and make a living
Nigga fuck a block, worldwide's a better vision

[Bridge]
Ooooooo

[Chorus]
Deer in the headlights
You know I can't stop, right?
Blowing money out the window
Living life bilingual
A deer in the headlights
You know I can't stop, right?
Blowing money out the window
Living life bilingual

[Bridge]
Ooooooo

[Outro]
Hol' up wait a minute!
(Repeats until fade)
