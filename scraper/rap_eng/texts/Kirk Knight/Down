[Hook]
Down, coming down, drinks on me
I ain't tryna do no harm
Vibe, sun's settin' in just please just vibe with me
Now hold me down
Down, coming down, drinks on me
I ain't tryna do no harm
Vibe, sun's settin' in just please just vibe with me
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down, I hold it down)
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down)
Now hold me down, down down
(I hold it down I hold it down I hold it down)
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down)

[Verse]
I was in Juventus tryna invent this theory don't believe in dreams
[?] it seems closed captions to describe these memes
Angle myself, learned on the surf that I needed help
But I found a helping of MC's
Square boxing hell indeed, meet me at the house warming please
Find the twelve jewels of life now it's a brand new side of things
Higher man, just the finer things
Hey mama, I'm mixing things
I'm finding change, don't charge me shit I don't abide by citizen rule
Rules of the earth don't fuck with you
Mother earth flows in you that's why I have chosen you
Dance in the moonlight, she move and wine, pon de ting I'm groovin' groovin'
Drunk by the night, I'm moving
I'm shifting gears, life is driving me crazy so I'm here
But I really don't drink much, potion in my cup
Nigga I'm tryna get fucked up

[Hook]
Down, coming down, drinks on me
I ain't tryna do no harm
Vibe, sun's settin' in just please just vibe with me
Down, coming down, drinks on me
I ain't tryna do no harm
Vibe, sun's settin' in just please just vibe with me
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down, I hold it down)
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down)
Now hold me down, down down
(I hold it down I hold it down I hold it down)
Now hold me down
(I hold it down, I hold it down)

[Outro]
Can you tell me about the music you make?
Well the music, it's about feelings, not about what I know
It's about what I feel
If we lose feeling, then we really dead
Most people on this planet have no feeling, you know
And I bet you they don't care about each other
