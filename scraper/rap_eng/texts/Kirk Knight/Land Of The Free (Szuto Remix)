[Verse]
Look it's kinda funny, how ya friends say they down to ride
But when you with them they don’t see ya like you sorta died

Only talking bout the music tryna give ya pride
You wanna say some to their face but you tongue-tied

Just forget them, let them get it when their time comes
Tryna make it when you make it like they little crumbs

Shit I been typing for a minute I got sore thumbs
Been tryna practice with the rapping I got sore gums

I went solo like Cube left the rest of em
Its fucking crazy how my ass just accepted them

But nowadays I walk the halls just rejecting them
When I grad 2020 I’m forgetting them

Fuck the world, Triple six, Ion’t give a fuck
My whole crew not a crew time to pull the plug

Ion’t need em cause who finna pay the bills?
Getting rejected by me now, tell me how it feels
