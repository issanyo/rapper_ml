[Verse 1: Cory Miller]
We always wonder what it's like to make it to the top
But if you really on your way
You wonder what its like to
Get stopped
Cock Blocked
Angry in that coffee shop
With no job, No dreams
Caught in between
Failure that's serene
Charlie Sheen's opposite
No conglomerate
Full of shit
This guy really thinks he's it
Who the fuck is this?
Everyone wants to win, but don't nobody know how
Ask the real people doing it
I bet they don't know how
The come-up is a crazy thing
Just work hard
Hope and Pray
With all this talent in the world
I hope that we will make it one day
But after seeing so many stars getting shot down
I keep my mind focused ain't no way I'm gonna drown now...

[Hook: Cory Miller]
Ain't no way I’m gonna drown now X4

[Verse 2: Cory Miller]
You see that road you walking down
Snake hollow
Won’t follow
Rolling deep, well then bravo
If you make it just give me a call-o
Sike
My time is shallow
My pride gets valued
You act to valiant
You ain't no stallion
Yousa coward man
Making a plan
Taking a step
A bit of chance, yep
Calling my mans
Taking a hit
Thats in my plans, yep
Unwind the time
Try to make light of this fucking
Rock on the road
Fork in the road
With no where to go
Theres no where to go
We on the same road you and I
Act like I’m high, but I’m just fine
Lost in time, not asking why
Or even asking how...

There's only one thing that I know now..

[Hook: Cory Miller]
Ain't no way I’m gonna drown now X4
