I relate to the terror and scary nights
From irreparable paradise
Impaired with a pair of dice
On the tear when I tear and dice
Tongue in air like a pair of Nikes
Paring a pair of dikes
Pear-shaped Paris Hiltons from Paris preparing rice
Compare me to Jerry Rice
Carries and they're in tights
Perils a pear that's ripe
Not married but they're in like
Apparent they're parents fright
They parry but they could my suck my pair like a parasite
And perish I'm making money like Erick and Parrish Mic
Rare and I rarely write
Robert Parish you're scared of heights
Zeroes doubled scratch like errit (dj scratch) this era's new Eric Wright
Air their new eras those on the air who your era likes
You arrogant error typed
Make errands of Aarons see how they fare in a fairer fight
Varies very uzi variant baring tikes
On your ferry raise the fare and the fahrenheit
Are you ready? It ain't numeric or errant flights
Then it's petty rappers who have a head for rap inherit a hair of lice
Scratch vocabulary's a narrow sight snapped
Fuck America I'll fuck America Ferrera snapmare her right on their Frigidaire then pipe
Fact come on stronger than pallbearers for Paul Bearer bear it paw of a bear and it barely swiped
That's bad news bearers barons in Barons stripes
Bats that don't flap staring down stairway flights
Traps going nowhere where Wu Wear was what me and Wu'd wear apparel we'd wear alike
Matched got that off of merit you merit mice
Rats I'm tryna rip the hair off of Scary Spice
Tracks how's that bi-atch...
