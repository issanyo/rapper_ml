[Verse 1: Chuck Strangers]
I break hearts, a hundred bills on cheap thrills
I spend it all, fuck up my wallet, stay on refill
Your wallet on E still, bitches doing E pills
Chuckie he get free fills, at strip clubs throwing ones
Black and red 1s, blunt rolled with a cold one
My ex she been choosy, but I could give a fuck
I'm with Rocka smoking Lucys, life been getting better
Since they heard about the Era
They say Chuckie got beats, but his bars can be better
Well if you gon' suck my dick, make it wetter
Odds against Che is slaughtered
Bumpin' Midnight Marauders
Niggas smoking with your daughters
You ain't getting beats until I see commas
Niggas act up, there's finna be problems
For the most part but niggas don't be wildin'
And if she ain't got no rubbers, it's no backstage pass
Retweet a dumb shit and watch the bitch get gassed
And all my Prodies just laugh

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
From the block to the block
Keepin heaters shunned
Like the chromosomes losing ends
The cells gone wrong
All I see is D-boys, tryna hold it down
While I'm in the lab tryna take the crown
Puffin loud, coughing at the most high
Don't wanna see a coffin
At most fear, til I hit the fuckin office
Sign me up, then I'm off this
I'm tryna be a prophet, I done heard niggas lost it
I'm so far, loungin back, I'm sofa
Niggas tryna censor me out like SOPA
But the sensor is so on, observe through scaffoldings
Make niggas throw the towel in
But word to the green it's just 48 laws of powering
And word to the world I'm only a fuckin hour in
Praise to the holy father while ducking undercover
Why bother? Aiight [Water]

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
You should already know when I get it mic checking
If I feel threatened as soon as I step in
Use the mic as my weapon, Reload my mind
Fire my thoughts and then I recoil these lines
Whoop! d-boys behind, know what they tryna find
My nine, but that's my mind, you can't touch it
That's a crime, how can I restrain silence
I got the right to remain violent
I can't stay still what's ya problem with that?
They like chill, you earning medals but it's harder than that
Diamonds and gold on me, so vanity has got its hold on me
But any ice got cold on me
So they don't know who Isis is, this priceless shit
Got enough shine to get you enlighten with
Strike like lightning, cobras try bitin him
But cold blood's thicker than the ink you writin in
