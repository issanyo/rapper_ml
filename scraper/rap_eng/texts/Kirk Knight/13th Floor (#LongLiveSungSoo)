집으로 가자 to the 13th floor, to the 13th floor

Father up in heaven, the one of flesh and blood
Your flesh and blood were so cold the day we sent you up
Couldn't see you 'fo it happened. On each side across an axis
Never thought I'd see your ashes. For us all, they got the matches
You asked me to come with you
Now I regret I asked if imma miss you
I thought America was home
It ain't a home if you're alone
I was stupid shoulda known
You shouldn't talk over the phone
Ironically, that's how we last talked
I wish I coulda seen your face before you passed on
Pastor, a position I could never pass off
Actors at church fake in their actions
Dealt with kids at home and you dealt with kids at church
I kid you not. I'd grab the chrome if I knew how much you hurt because of them
Those two faces and backstabbers, they left you empty handed with cold feet, your body damaged. Damn it
All I could do was sit and watch while they put you on the cross
Treated you like you were God
But when you slipped they let you fall
Can't forgive religion, what it did to you
You were livin proof that it's livin proof
I blame God for killin you
Guess I ain't sinner proof. I'm a sinner too
I hope you can forgive me for choosin this way of living
Now I'm focusing on taking care of my mom and my siblings
They shot the sheriff. As the eldest son, I'm the deputy
I'm carryin' your legacy by treasuring the memories
Imma miss the time we spent working out in gyms
Long walks on the beach after burping out our grins
Vacations with hotels and nice dinners
Watchin movies 'til the neighbors come and fight with us
Always kept my letter top your desk over the sermon papers
Your desk top pic of us is now my wallpaper
Pride in your son. Every time I climb up the one to push me harder was you. I'm growin up
I had a dream after comin' from the funeral
I was at the apartment still in refusal
Rode the elevator to our home floor
As it reached 13 a light shined through the doors
It was you. Both of us still wearing suits
And I couldn't help but cry as I was embracing you
Hard to get my grip to loosen
Losin' somebody I grew with
But I didn't say goodbye cause I know this ain't the conclusion
I wanted you to stay, but I knew you had to go
So with every single day
I'm just glad the day is close when I get to see your face again
When I'm at that place again
I'll make you proud 아버님
We're doin well, your three kids and your 사모님
다시 만날게요 on the 13 floor, on the 13 floor

(Chorus)
See you on the 13th floor
See you on the 13th floor

집으로 가자 to the 13th floor, to the 13th floor

(Chorus)
