[Intro]
Ride for my niggas on site
Ride for my niggas on site
Ride for my niggas on site

[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
The flows is acidic
Cruising in a slow-ass Civic, I got gas, hit it
Hold up, cops passed, I stop, laugh, hit it
Jakes is snake lizards, if they smell they won't come hither
Nigga, I hisses at your misses
Slither down her throat, spit her up, (mmm) delicious
I'm too malicious, this one for my mistresses
In distress, cause positions that I put 'em in could stretch
Can't contest him, get the rude boy vexed
True shotta give him two shots, rude bwoy fi dead
Boom, bye bye in a batty man head
The sooner I die, sooner them gets ahead
So you do the math
Put the pieces to the puzzles like Voodoo in the trap
No strings attached
In fact, it's all connected in the sense, neglected in the
Cents, plus well collecting my respect

[Chorus]
They say we too loud, we need to turn it down
I copped a pound, now I'm 'bout to burn it down
Hotbox in this bitch know I'm burnin' out
And what I'm learning now is still more trees to go around
They say we too loud, we need to turn it down
I copped a pound, now I'm 'bout to burn it down
Hotbox in this bitch know I'm burnin' out
And what I'm learning now is still more trees to go around

[Verse 2: NYCk Caution]
Pick the weapon up and use it
Deceptive tactics never get between me and my music
Reason for that livin' condition you livin' a witness, a god with his mic
Starry nights ain't never come, cause they don't go where it's bright
So how the fuck can I go shine, when my constellation dim
I conversate with momma just to know where I begin
Then condensate yo' armor so it's weaker by your limbs
Blast the speakers when you speak up cause you bleak in measurement
Stay relentless if you get it
Second place is ours we're clocking in any minute (Alright)
Cause first is not imagined
They got me cursed with this new apparent future
That I will never reinsert my fuckin' balance
I'm a frog, you a cricket - once was just a tadpole
And I'm still a tad poor, trying to fix it
They ballin' with no limits, reckless in the Rari's
So how the fuck you expect me to be civil in Civics

[Chorus]
They say we too loud, we need to turn it down
I copped a pound, now I'm 'bout to burn it down
Hotbox in this bitch know I'm burnin' out
And what I'm learning now is still more trees to go around
They say we too loud, we need to turn it down
I copped a pound, now I'm 'bout to burn it down
Hotbox in this bitch know I'm burnin' out
And what I'm learning now is still more trees to go around
