[Verse 1: Chelsea Reject]
Yo, walking through the city that I like to claim is mine
Please don't try to talk to me if you're gon' waste my time
Awkwardly stepping all over these decrepit Rick's
Representing life is a movie leave them all in suspense
Momma heard that I'm spittin'
Askin if I been gettin' high
But I don't know the difference
Cause even when I feel low and I'm sober, I'm lifted
(Wait a minute, give it time, give it time)
I just gotta stay commited
This is the shit that I love
Really putting everything all align
So I know that I can't give it up
See I try to go to an Arts school
But I learned that the canvas is us
So I dropped out of that Art school
Fuck a degree I need a craft right now
Need to make life count
Mean something to me when I'm smoking that loud
I branch out, til he ain't fuckin' with me
Sooooo
Lookin' at the past current events like how could you be so cold
Love and marry so old
Even doh' I wouldn't dose 'em, like we good though
Ask me for a feature though

[Hook: T'nah Apex]
Ask me for a feature though
Look at me when you count'cho dough
Let you know that it's on the flo'
Burnin', burnin', burnin'
Don't come to me
Don't come to me
I'll drop a seed
I'll just sleep, stretch the week
Crumble under tread and feet
Don't come to me
I'll drop a seed
I'll just leave, stretch the week
Crumble under tread and feet

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
No honor among thieves these days
How am I suppose to feel these days
Phases change like mitosis
Who could come the closest to the finish line
Never studied but seem to osmosis
Knowing that the knowledge is more potent
But so different, feelin' like I'm suppose holster
'listic pigs throw the dirt on they name
Demons sayin' angels aim on people slavin' over stoves
Overdose ain't cracked up to be
But more unhappily mind states
Malady the crime rate
Like my salary man
That BK battery
Just taught to keep wildin'
Teach more violence
And I ain't buyin' it
Sellin' dreams, remain silent
Completely honest
Only good human being is a dead one by the farm land
Came from the dirt it's that dead man rising 'em
So when the sun shine
Know those for raids on parades
And start 47 stylin'

[Hook: Kirk Knight & T'nah Apex]
Don't come to me
Don't come to me
Don't come to me
I'll plant a seed
I'll just sleep, stretch the week
Crumble under tread and feet
Don't come to me
Don't come to me
Don't come to me
I'll plant a seed
Stretch the week
Crumble under tread and feet
