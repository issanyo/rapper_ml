[Intro: Nyck Caution]
Everything I spit direct so y'all really feel it
Finally got up off the wall, it's time to really kill it
Always keep your shit in check, you never know the time
That you finally pay the debt, that you owe your life
So until my last breath, I'll be on my shit
Do my best to make these dreams finally exist
But if I don't become the man I said I'm gonna be
Remember me for who I was, and not for who I couldn't be

[Hook: Kirk Knight]
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
I said I'm off the wall, I feel the flow within
I'm on my God of War, Kratos how I'm going in
Rock the cradle y'all been sleepin' on the kid
Rip the bib from 'round my neck and wrap a chain around it
It's Nyck Caution, spell it with a "Y" when you write it
Small white kid with the bars, he's a Titan
All right, I'll be up all night
This ain't nothin' new to me, this is what I call life
Off the wall, took my first step, wasn't very scared
And if I can make it here I can make it anywhere
It's my year every year, I don't make no resolutions
I just seek revenge, everyday is my retribution
I be on the record ruthless, when it rains it pours
I'm tryna weather through it, hurricane and storms
Hope my umbrella soothes it, either way I gotta grind it out
Livin' through the lows, time we started climbin' out

[Hook: Kirk Knight]
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in
I'm destined to blow boy, we gon' win
Off the wall, going in

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Off the wall, off the shizz
Paranoia ain't my only problem kid
Sell it to a mother in her stomach is a kid learning
That where I'm from that's just some regular shit
So, 'til then it's get it how you live
God forbid can't bring home the bacon 'cause I die from one of these pigs
Life's a gamble, take a risk
I'm callin' shots that don't miss, ya bitch we ballin'
Just to get the point across that we can't be stallin', money callin'
Livin' conditions revoking my primal instincts
Gotta get it even if somethin' ends up missin'
Prayin' to the Lord circumstances that a nigga given like
Way easy to sell drugs, fuck hoes forget love
Sip mud 'til I'm bed tucked, quit fightin' get your bands up
Keep Glock on extendo, no games it's Nintendo
You earn stripes 'til the bands show
Like a old head, I been grown
Off the wall, my energy through the roof
A nigga got a lotta things I need to prove
Turn up the gain, I got nothin' to lose
I keep too much to my self, I let it out in the booth
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like

[Outro: Kirk Knight & Nyck Caution]
I had to get myself, get myself, get myself, get myself
On it
Let's get it started nigga
