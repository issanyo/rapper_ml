[Hook]

Ride On The Block
Don't Talk To Cops
Get Rich Or Drop Dead
Fuck The Opps
Fuck The Feds

Nigga Play Wit Me I'm Puttin Lead In His Head
I Can't Fuck With You If You Ain't Bout Chasin Bread
Talk To Paper Everyday Nigga, Fuck What Hov Said

And All Yo Hoes Boring I Can't Fuck No Plain Jane

[Verse 1]

We Da Playaz Circle, My Dawg Tran Got 2 Chainz
I'm The Man Fuck You Sayin?
I Can't Play No Damn Games
It's 2018 I Can't Fuck If You Payin
Got The Fro With The Twists
I Look Like A Super Saiyan
Call Yo Uber You Ain't Stayin

Run A Train & Take Yo Money Like I'm AT&T
If You Ain't Got No Money You Can't Call Me For Free
Claim You From The Slums But Yo Hood Got Mo Gates Than Rock Lee
Young Black And Cocky Cuz I Know That They Can't Stop Me
Got That Green On Me Like Broccoli
We Voted For Her, But Y'all Call This Democracy?
Somebody Come And Talk To Me

Cuz Soon We Gon Get Tired Of Talkin
And That's When Bodies Start Droppin
You Hear The Shotty Start Clockin
And Then The Country Turn To St. Louis
And Everbody Start Robbin Like We In Gotham
I Promise You Don't Want Problems So Solve Em
You Think The World Revolve Around You
Until You See This Revolver

I Speak For My People Rebuking All Evil
(I'll Kill That Nigga)
We Gon Have To Kill Him To Make Sure That It AIn't No Sequel
(I'll Kill That Nigga)
Pimp Daddyy Flow Is So Lethal
My Niggas Live So Illagal
I'm Feelin Like Beanie Seigal
The Real Is Back

Uncle Shannon, I'm Sippin This Yak. Gotta Stay Off Them Blacks
Gotta Get To These Racks, From Wrangler Jeans To Truies At Saks
(Drip)
My Momma Lost A Lotta Money On Me But Ima Make It All Back
From Runnin Track To Runnin The World
Damn It's Fucked You Said You Love Her
Then My Niggas Ran A Train On Yo Girl On A Fuckin Trampoline
You Don't Even Be Fuckin She Let Us Know You A Dweeb
And I Heard She Suck A Mean Dick For Weed
I Don't Want No Used Throat Though I Just Want My Cheese

Aye, I Look Like I Play For Tennessee With All This Yellow On Me
Pimp Daddyy Wu Killa Bee
You The Only Ten I See
I Could Get You Addicted To That D
Have You Pullin Up On Me , Gas Tank On E
Ain't Nobody Finna Fuck You Like A Real Fuckin G

Luckily Baby Girl You Found Me

[Verse 2}

I Bust Through He Walls Like Kool-Aid, I'm Insane
No Cap In My Raps, Been Through Some True Pain
But I Found A New Lane
Johnny Tsunami I Found A New Wave
Made It Out The Dirt But Seen Worse
Heard Life Stories Sound Like They Was Damn Near Cursed
I Done Robbed, But You A Bitch If You Steal Out Ya Mom's Purse
Bout Action I Don't Rehearse
(Bitch)

All Black Wit Da Hoodie On And I Know She Know What's Up
Baby Girl This Is My Shit
(Na Na Na Na)

Don't Give A Fuck Who Rapped On It First
Whatever The Can Pay Me I'm Worth A Lot More Than
I Was Down Bad Gotta Run Up The Score Then
He Was Talking Mad Shit So A Nigga Ran Up And Scorched Him
Johnny Torched Him, Fantastic Four Em
The Thing Is I Been Duckin The Feds Like I'm Invisible
Susan Storm
She Call My Dick Mr. Fantastic It Like An Arm

Aww man...
