[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
First of all, Mr. Cooper
On these beats you need to make it feel more super
We need it like duper
MF DOOM or Lord Finesse?
Don’t know
Come through bring the fucking floss to your chest
It’s too much flaws in this shit, not even my style
I’m the type to might go wild, the golden child
From the BK borough, this shit is not thorough
I don’t like this beat
Make another one tomorrow

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
The room smell like buddah so light up some incense
And I’m worried about my future ‘cause my past was intense
Now a guys careers buzzing, cuz they think he’s insects
Pair of mid class bitches, have em cummin in sex
But they ours, sweet dreams, smoking sours, picking white
Bitches like flowers, gave Kelly a golden shower
With an R im over your head like I’m on to the next
These bitches is fucking me over and over again

[Verse 3: Chuck Strangers]
You can me Chuck but it's Charles to these hoes
The only fucking stranger that everybody knows
Man, life’s great
Me and my niggas fresher than ya
Kicks on release date, for Pete’s sakes, we in it
We told a friend to tell a friend now that strangers shit's a trend
Not a lifestyle or a movement, just some plans
That we drew up, used to be Che, but I grew up
Now meet Chuck Strangers, the motherfucking screw up

[Verse 4: Joey BADA$$]
Once and again, it’s the flow on the check-in
When I come through and I step in, gotta get the Wessun
This Beast Coast shit that I be reppin’
But you know I do it one time for my brethren
Never peep a flow second I come off straight the melon
Niggas got the shit to tell ‘em, they tried to tell him
They tried to erase them off the tomb
But they see us and we racing with the jewels

[Verse 5: Kirk Knight]
Checking my chakras, it’s total silence
Just watching, my mind extends
Thoughts cause what you call corruption
But a temple keep you sane
I’m sayin’ I don’t think I can live life this way
Where I got to ask my homies for gats instead of homework would home work
If life begins, I get lazy and I slip up
Like a dick inside a condom when I’m trying to fuck some pussy
You are what you eat, but I swear, don’t push me

[Verse 6: ROKAMOUTH]
Rap assassins, cruising right past ‘em, no actin’
All I hear is talking, see no action
Hit you so hard, you ain’t even know what happened
Went and lost your rank just for fucking with the captain, slackin’
Now you just stuck up, stuck up in the past tense
Absence…

[Verse 7: Joey BADA$$]
Ain't shit fly unless I rock it, fly like drop kicks
In cockpits, Red Eye fly shit, holding chopsticks
Yo, weigh your options: it’s either you hide your optics
Or it’s back to the block with your profit-less pockets
And I ain’t trying to be another hoodlum, cruel and gruesome
Knew I’d be a big baller before I grew some
Shooting on the cannon, been the last man standing
Let me keep flowing, damn it
You see I been the rhyme-slinging bandit
I came straight through and the legends just handed me
Say, “Yo, he the baby of the golden era”
So you know I should know it’s better
When I come through, and born this way
See I was born this way
And these fiends they just mourn this way
I get on in the morning and play

[Verse 8: Chuck Strangers]
You know how many joints we done sparked in Union Square Park?
After dark, ashing joints out on cop cars
My crew never gave a fuck before
Like Bush in ‘04, all we do is stay high
Shit those was some good times and shout out to Dread
‘Cause, shit, those was some good dimes
And we still live it though our haters lives difficult
Hate to see me winning we put our jeans behind our tongues
Because you know us niggas winning

[Verse 9: Capital STEEZ]
And they already know who I been
Third eye wide, they shouldn't let the flouride in, shit
Let him begin to blend in with the pen
And cut through it like the sun in the wind, shit
I got them wavelengths on point, let's make shifts
Mischief, causing a menace up in the basement
Hazmatic aura, I’m not the one to play with
STEEZ been tight with the flow since the slave ships
I’m the savior; he’s obviously gifted
Trigonometry analogies are twistin’ the system
13 different dimensions
And the rest get swept in quicksand

[Verse 10: Dirty Sanchez]
I could make it rain and they’re open like umbrellas
I’m flier than propellers; ain’t shit that you could tell us
Bitches that like to whine, we throw ‘em in the cellar
Give ‘em time to mature and hopefully they’ll come out better
Never promise marriage, still wetting the pussy
I’m that high definition so you can’t overlook me too
Eagle eye, check the bird’s eye view
An evil guys since my third tattoo

[Verse 11: Joey Bada$$]
I could tell you what it is; I could tell you what it isn’t
Hop in turnstiles, but I ain't trying to go to prison
I’m trying to earn a better livin’
Ain’t really asking for a lot
By the age of 25, I’m just trying to be alive so I
Speak my piece and sneak my trees
[?] into the cup where the D's won’t peep
I might tell your chick what’s up if the physique is sweet
And if the head right, I’ll be there every night

[Verse 12: Chuck Strangers]
Fuck school, I took a chance with show biz
Now it’s cameras where we go
Shoot a video, passing hydro to Roby Ro
Car on cruise control, look ma no hands
Niggas rollin' my watch showin’
You mad? It’s too bad
You stressed off them seeds in yo quarter bag?
My prodies roll something that you wish y’all had

[Verse 13: Joey BADA$$]
Call it bags, before I couldn’t afford the hash
But now I got like 10 Porsche, what's the stash?
Got the stash hidden. You see me?
These rhymes is forbidden, this shit is only when I get bitten
Come out of battle with flea bites, you know my feed right
Niggas don’t want it cause I’m that flea type
And I be in the sky with Skyder
Came back through, niggas tried to drink cider
I don't know, let me get the flow liver
The livest one, chillin’ in Bedford-Stuyvesant
They tried to pass me the livest blunt
Said, “How you ain’t gone just shine this way?”
Say, he the Sun God, so you know he had to do it one time

[Verse 14: CJ Fly]
Better check your specs cause you ain't seein me
I spit that crack so it make sense
Why I'm the negus who you fiend to be
Trying to be like me you niggas Tweedledum and Tweedledee
Flier than Tweetie Bird, tweetin’ words from a cedar tree
You see the G, no contest nor contestin’
Nobody can test this, I’m not to be f’d wit'
So fuckin’ with me, it shouldn't be on your checklist
It’s more like a death wish
I’m just suggestin’ that you jet quick to the closest exit
Before you end up getting your head split
