We some motherfuckin' MK residents, shit, killin’ the best of it
Hittin' president heads like hits spittin' censorship
Gold membership and Connecticut, that’s the residence
Fuck the rest of it, ain't no testin' it, we the best of it
School bomb threat, it's a suicide summer
Cause MK ULTRA takin' off like suicide jumpers
From slam dunkers to land gunners, we hand fun to
Man cause he understands hunger and can't wander up
Ain't no runnerup, 2nd place trophy cup
First to cross the finish line and still ain't comin’ number one
I’m punchin' lines like a highway hit and run
Ditch and duck, only hit the mic when I’m spittin' up
Lyrical acid tabs, into the aftermath and I'm spittin' raps
Straight from the soul, on everything I have
I’m itchin' bad like a drug addicted dad
For boom bap, I really need a fix of that, truest rap
I'm the one y'all laughin' at when you feelin' bad
Low self esteem got you makin' fun of all my tracks
I heard my tracks are wack, I'm laughin' back after that
I heard you listen to that wack sad faggot rap
You flat broke, no cash-flow, you lack dough
Whippin' lassos, you Castro to mad hoes
Flow master, my flows drippin' out like magma
So plasma drippin', that's a hit for you bastards
