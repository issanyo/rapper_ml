[Intro]
In the place ah
Young Dust in the place ah

[Verse 1]
Transform like Optimus
Know I gotta stay optimistic
But these niggas keep bitching
Penny for your thoughts but
You ain't worth listening
The Kirk Knight killer
It was giving them my christening
Such a contradiction, pissing the whole world off
The most god your lion kings get rolled off
This is protocol, ring bells
When I shake the globe
Get those off don't got to wave a mag
To show I'm living large
Shawty want beef too
Anybody fucking get it, don't forget it
Thief in the night in the light
I stole the show and I leave that embedded nigga
Sleep on me get wig by a legion
Nigga stop leeching, nigga start leading
Going through the darkest hour
Just to see the light of day
Vision Donnie Darko
Cheaper price for doomsday

[Chorus]
So I give 'em what they need
Something to believe in (x4)
So I give em what they need
So I give em what they need
So i give 'em what they need
Something to believe in (x2)

[Verse 2]
This ink just flows through me
Show you I'm way more than gloomy
Out of the site like George Clooney
Thinking so out the box, think I cross the line
Single order line when I'm addressing my prime
The only one realest motherfucker alive
Too many seeds in my flower of life
So son, understand any universe you spit
Wouldn't fit into my galaxy
Putting you to rest
The sweetest flow, giving you a sugar rush
Behold glorious lines bury us
Young dust trust, better believe
I won't ever stop 'til my Kinetic energy
Bring Zeus to his knees
For the weak MC's
Put the enemies to their knees
For the weak MC's
Do I give em what they need?

[Chorus]
