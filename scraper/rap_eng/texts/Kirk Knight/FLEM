[Intro]
Yeah, Kirk Knight what up
Yeah, I had to write on paper for this one haha
Yeah, uh huh, New York
Yeah, yeah, still got my cold and shit
Check it out

[Verse 1]
A lifetime supply of Adidas
Sneaker deal, getting Franklins like Aretha
Uncle did fifteen, still got him a visa
He got through Canada, next year is Ibiza
Oh now my Twitter fingers working
Album about to drop, had to warn 'em before I murk 'em
Kirk Knight on the beat (Kirk Knight)
Feel these vibrations through your feet
It's like a bad bitch with some bad toes
Cause I never felt defeat
And I never had to reach
Put in work the elite will fuck with me
I know y'all seen the Kanye tweet
Just as long as Jay and Kanye peep
Haha, that's fine with me
In time the world is mine, you'll see
I call Khaled for the motivation
He hit me with the cloth talk, he told me get some patience
I know I'm ill but I'm steady waiting
Already cooked the album up but I'm still baking

[Hook]
Kirk Knight on the beat right
All night, alright
Yeah
Come on, come on

[Verse 2]
Third year at Coachella
Phlegm still in my chest, I'm going gorilla
Flacko tell you how they did him, he sounded so fed up
Fergie here and next week we doing mo' better
Should have hit 'em with Work and Shabba
I better, New Levels and do it proper
I probably do strive and start to gossip
Bring Missy out, I'll probably bring Diddy out
Man I'm repping New York, they'll probably bring the city out
Probably get Janet Jackson to pull her whole titty out
Breakfast with a billionaire, Turkey Bacon at Diddy's house
I could have fucked my life up with the Bobbi and Whitney route
God bless 'em them drugs is a weapon
Yammy was so high that I had to learn my lesson
Man I came a long way from depression
To dealing with oppression, to higher upsetting
Trump win, I'm flying off the soil
I'm going back to where they treat us royal
All this fuckin' bullshit make my blood boil
Just know that I'll put it all on the line for ya

[Hook]
Kirk Knight on the beat right
All night, alright
Yeah
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
