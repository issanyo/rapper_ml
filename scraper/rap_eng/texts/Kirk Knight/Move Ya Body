[Verse 1]
Badass nigga, please don't disrespect him
They couldn't get a verse, he's too interesting
Punchlines hit 'em two times, first one slept 'em
Second one, crept in, pull 'em out of projection
And it's the resurrection
Of the boom bap rap in his new reflection
I am true to that that, dude you stressing
When I'm in ya section, know you feel the tension
Don't forget to mention him again
Lose your breath, in the flesh, dimensions i can bend
I ascend, probably hear me up in the heavens
Roll my pit of dice for a lucky number seven
I'm the number one threat
Kirk keep the track running, never broke a sweat
Yo i'm on the increment, when you get the news, man i jet
Rep that Beast Coast gang, my PE set

[Hook]
Shake ya body body
Move ya body body
Shake ya body body
Move ya body body
Shake ya body body
Move ya body, don't stop
Keep it moving
