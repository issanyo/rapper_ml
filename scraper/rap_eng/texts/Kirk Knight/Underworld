[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Kirk Kneezy on the beat, yeah!

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
I was gettin' my heart broke, now I'm the heartbreaker
She be drawin' pentagrams, she a soul-taker
When she took me to her room, all I saw was three six
I know that's what heartbreak is made of
3-9 on my wrist, bitch, hell upside
Cupid try to kill you, I'm in the crossfire
Demons come in handy like a spare tire
They put my life on the wire
Yeah, I'm gettin' higher and higher
Pill pop shorty, I do not need a lighter
Heart stop shorty, I'ma go out flyin'
Let me stop playin', bitch, I already died

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Here we go
It was all heaven just a week ago
Now I'm up in hell with my eyes closed
Gettin' sucked up by a devil ho
Takin' these pills on an empty stomach
It's like gettin' fucked up with the devil, ho
Fuckin' to my favorite heavy metal, ho
We know all the words so it's special
So so special
I loved her and let her go (go, go, go), fuck that
Maybe I'ma hold her close, get the fuck back
I'm about to overdose, and she love that
Story of a demon seducin' a young drug head

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Demon girl, how come you hold me close?
I like it, don't let go
You are my overdose
In the underworld, we roam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
-oam (roam)
