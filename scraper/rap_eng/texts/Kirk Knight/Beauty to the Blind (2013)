(Intro)

Yeah baby
This one's for you..
You know who you are..

(Verse 1)
The only lady I could ever share my dreams with
Or be seen with, and whatever route we take, let's make it scenic
A million pinches wouldn't make me believe it
Borderline bulimic
My appetite for you is real, bonita applebum
Change what your tribe is called, the quest is to put you on
Whenever I feel gone, she make me come back home
I guess you can say she turned the streetlights on
He stay on track and he right wrongs
She the reason that he write songs, forreal
Babygirl let's write our names in the sky
So the whole world will know about you and I
Love, love

(Verse 2)
Feelin' your style
You're more swank than Hilary's child
Murderous appeal, you're killin' me now
I know you feelin' how I'm unveiling your smile
Feelin' you with serums of the deep healin' of Chiles
You're really more than a memory now
Runnin' through my mind runnin' all your energy out, ain't it?
Well give me all you got and I'll hold it dearly
A young king, won't you come and be my Nefertiti
They say you only live once so what is life, really
If you ever left I, my life would become chilly
And it's alot of niggas trying to seem real as me
A bunch of mini-me's, you dealin' with the realest me
And as long as you're here with me
I promise to keep it 100 like a century
For the next 100 centuries
Because we was meant to be-come one identity, love
