[Intro: EyeDeeSwank]
'98 'till[x2]
'till infinity
I said this is how we chill from '98 'till[x2]

[Verse 1: EyeDeeSwank]
I said check this
Who these nigga's trynna' fex with
I came back with some tech shit not tetris
But i know some nigga's stacking bricks for the next rent payment
But i know it really isn't worth shit
Stay up on a pivot like a rolly chair
To avoid these snakes and demons
But they see him
He's making moves like game season
Tossing flows into the salad when they toss it no fake seasoning
Hot for niggas you repping thats faulty
That's why i keep a triangle of nigga's no illuminati
But we hating fuck the racist party
All these sneaky politicians probably setting up a racist party
Like y'all niggas retarded
Just started
No flow like his
He's spitting poets like artistics
Even if you study couldn't copy it
This one's for the niggas that's going to try to copy shit
Like do you roger that copy over
Loud lyrics make a nigga deaf he wasn't even sober
Sometimes these people never even know one
True shit behind the money because the feds'll never even show us
Like go check statistics
And fuck the wishlist
We getting rich off a hitlist
No dirty work but we killing beats of a hitlist
We killing beats off a hitlist[x3]
