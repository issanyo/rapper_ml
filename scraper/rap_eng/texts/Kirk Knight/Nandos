[Intro]
Yeah
Nowadays shit is crazy out here man
Gotta protect yourself, yeah

[Chorus]
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
That's what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
This what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me

[Verse 1]
Hundred bottles in the club when I land though
We was in the PJ flying high fucking up Nandos
Landed in Cannes for a couple bands, that was the plan though
We gotta get a couple model bitches we gon' fuck on the damn boat
The SLS got me dippin' out, we gon' fuck with the Lambo
The pigs fuckin' with me I'mma turn into Django
Let's ride on these niggas 'til Kirk Knight gotta speed up the tempo
This Hennessy got me fucked up, yeah I ain't feelin' my pain though
Feelin' my pain though

[Chorus]
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
That's what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
That's what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me

[Verse 2]
Fuckin' hatin' niggas damning my interviews
Fuck what you thinkin' my nigga? This USA shit get it critical
I'm not talkin' lyrical
I'm talkin' po-po-po that be shootin' niggas in the blues
Shit is so cynical
Call up a Uber now my little niggas will finish you
Now look what I did to you
Motherfucker don't you see that I'm ridin'
24/7 on the corner all my niggas they be all survivin'
Used to only hear ice cream trucks now all we hear is sirens
That's 'cause this fucking world only stuck on money and violence
Money and violence

[Chorus]
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
That's what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me
Load up the chopper and ride on your enemies (Trap)
That's what you get when you fuck with the family (Lord)
Roll with the fuckin' winners we the winner team (Trap)
You fuck with my niggas you gettin' the penalty (Lord)
Remember me
