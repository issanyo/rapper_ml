[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
I done had patience for this
I done waited ages for this
Wrote so many, I done waited, I done waited ages for this
Wrote so many pages for this
I done waited, I done
This is not rap, this is all mine, nigga
Parkside tatted on my heart, my nigga

[Chorus: Kirk Knight & Lucille Gotti]
I need to save you
But who's gonna save me? I cannot rely on you
I’ll be back soon (I'll be back)
I need to save you
But who's gonna save me? I cannot rely on you
I’ll be back soon (Ahh)
If life don't take my life away, if life don't take my life away
Then, I'll be back soon (I'll be back soon)

[Verse: Kirk Knight]
Slang in my grammar, only to the hammer
Brain scattered, glass floor, shattered
And the streets, hazard
And my knees, shattered
Need pockets, fatter
Bag pills, mastered
Whole clique, standard
Need moments, laughter
Tick-tock, staggered
My pain, gathered

[Chorus: Kirk Knight & Lucille Gotti]
I need to save you
But who's gonna save me? I cannot rely on you
I'll be back soon (I'll be back soon)
I need to save you
But who’s gonna save me? I cannot rely on you
I’ll be back soon (I'll be back)
If life don’t take my life away (If life don't take my)
If life don't take my life away
Then, I'll be back soon (I’ll be back soon)

[Outro: Kirk Knight]
Whoa, hey
Whoa, hey
Dum-dum-dah-dum
Dum-dum-dah-dum
Dum-dum-dah-dum
Dum-dum-dah-dum
