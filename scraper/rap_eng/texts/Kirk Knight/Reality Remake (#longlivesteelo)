Fourteen years before today I dreamed myself of something more
Since I was four I knew great things for me somebody had in store
My dad looked at me his hand on my back to pat me so happy I had a family
As happy as any can be
Long story short what I saw, was not a reality
Happy morphed into tragedy, family broke in catastrophe
Daddy was sent packing, so family was then lacking
And so that began the acting of a braty-ass happening
My imagination to date, is a creation of a generation
Of playing playstation, flippin' through stations
Searchin' for inspiration to keep me patient
As I wait on my hero's graces to bring me elevation
I hate wasting time, that's why I use mine wise
I'm up every hour of the night to figure out a rhyme
And I'm not even 5 miles close to getting signed
But I won't fall short of getting known before I die
That's why it might sound like I cry and whine
But you don't understand the fuel that fires my desire
My dad is the reason that I inspire to spit fire
And build up and empire of people like me
So we can together fly higher than ever believed
Steep loss of feathers so together we weep
My dad loves his kids like no one, has ever witnessed
Complete sacrifice for their lives, his only mission
Long hours spent in the kitchen washin' dishes
While my mom was in Las Vegas on a well-deserved vacation
Man fuck that
She leaves me scars beneath my skin, so deep you could all fit in
And to think that im part her kin
A wicked love that we shared
I felt stricken and scared I felt naked and bare
But still I'd taked in the air
This is the women who birthed me so tell me
Why does she hurt me and personally curse all the persons I put firstly
I yearn for her courtesy, mother won't you nourish me?
Mother won't you flourish with my father? That's my only dream
I'm eighteen now, but tell me how's it gonna be
When your daughter moves out the house and she's looking to me a spouse
Tell me
Do you even think about
The way I feel and how it pains me to even say this out loud?
I'm actin out now, I'm rappin' until I pass out
Pass me a towel cause' I'm out of this fuckin trap house

Although I've got some issues with my family
Without their offense to all my nonsense
I'd probably be lawless, I'd probably be Godless
Livin' on the streets usin' the cake that I can scrape
To purchase cocain and xannies
You can hate me, for who I am and what I do
But if I were you, I would save the hate and walk away
Cause' your words will not break me, or make me stray away
From the path that I have chose, repay those that gave my name
I know you feel the same, somehow, in some way
Cause' if you were me, you would wonder from where came all the distaste
Negativity will not stop me, my principles are Godly
I take comfort in the fact knowing those that I love, got me
Yes I can rap, as a matter of fact I practice
The fact is, this action out my mouth is that of class, this
Talent that I have is unmatched for who I am and the plan
Is to blast to the cap, and pass it back
You can laugh at, my attempts to flow like water
But you're only as hot as your ho, oh wait that's your daughter
I'm not startin' shit, just know that I got a lot of
Heart for what I do and for it, I would die a martyr
