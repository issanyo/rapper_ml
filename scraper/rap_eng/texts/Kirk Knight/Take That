Just got your text, like baby downstairs I'm here
She just told a nigga everything I need to hear
Living in the moment, so she never show that fear
Say no more let's go you know I take that shit from here

[Hook]
Straight from here (2x)
Just got your text, I'mma take it higher
Straight from here (2x)
Just got your text, I'mma take that, take that, take that

[Verse 1]
My three eye's open but I got mad cash
And a nigga out here tryna find a new thrill
And my new dime piece bust it open cock it back
So she show me how she act where my hand feel
Like leave 'em Blues Clues like a nigga fell
Let that ass tell a story like a Copperfield
Enough of playing baby let me cop a feel
Hit a home run then I get up outta here
Ditto
Always for the smart, cause I [?]
Only do the talk, get the face and the pillow
Took the hour glass, take my time, Black widow
And I pull the g-string like a nigga play the cello
On your high horse when you twerk in stilettos
Roll the next spliff don't got space for the filler
Text another one, now it's two one thriller
And they loving my brother, Call it Malcolm in the Middle

[Verse 2]
Working on her frame
Make the outer body fitter
Money on these shots and trips increase quicker
I don’t drink really
But you lost me I can’t think of
And she set the J-pickup while we’re gone for the picture
Picture
Picture
Picture
Mmm-hmm
Come through then I see her here for a little
Always catch some vices? like a nigga wasn’t nearer
And that flexibility you deserve a
Gold medal

I’m not your average statistic
I can throw a big tip if you kiss it
When I do
That crib go ballistic
Rub it on
Need that water resistant
Mirror tone ain’t doggy, you connect it
The way you work
You don’t need a commission
Higher than the pedestal your man be presented
Pull up right now
I don’t ever need an entrance
Entrance
Entrance
Entrance…
