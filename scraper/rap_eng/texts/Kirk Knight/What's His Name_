[Intro]
Was his name Freddie? Or was his name Travon?
They say we all the same, Maybe it was Daquan
Maybe it was-man the question is do they care dog?
Man they been buried the bodies time to move on
Was his name Freddie? Or was his name Travon?
Maybe it was Mike brown, they won't even know dog
By the time we hit the graves it'll be long gone
It'll be long gone

[Verse 1]
Shots through the window, bullets hit me home but they ain't een hit my Kinfo
No love for no popo, so go and cut that pig to a slice like kimbo
For real though
Feel as though I should by burners no burgers for my five guys
Cuz we in the days where the cops are doing drive by's
But I don't even get up out my seat
I'm too busy praying that the lord watch over me
But what am I supposed to do if they miss me go and hit my homeboy too
At the funeral they singing for you that'll knock me out the rhythm and just give me the blues
If I survive I can't let that slide
Peace is two fingers but I'll hold mine with five
It's the holy and the homies that been keeping me alive
So I woulda been snapped if they took one of mine

[Hook 3x]
Was his name Freddie? Or was his name Travon?
They say we all the same, Maybe it was Daquan
Do they know my name? Is my head on strong?
Or are they gone wait till I'm dead and gone

[Verse 2]
I just wanna thank Kendrick & Huey p
For taking out the time to educate me & honestly you up on that level to me
Cuz of you I know that education is weaponry
I ain't been through what you been through but I wrestled with the devil
When he come through I suplex him back to his level
Feel like Triple H, the undertaker ain't taking me
And I ain't gone look back and say they should be thanking me I'm used to no applause and no body guards
I just learned that to them being black is like being scarred and they can't appreciate the beauty of the burns that I earned and peal back the scab of the lessons I learned
I mean the music and the TV was all I need
That was my book bag & homework since 13
And what I seen recently didn't open my eyes cuz I been hip to the racist political lies
Throw my hands up I get smoked
I can't breathe the trigger squeeze to my throat
So when they make me bleed I hope that I provoke
This is no laughing matter boy like a bad joke
Then they wonder why I don't like police
He ain't pulling me over he pulling my destiny
And he can end all my dreams with what he kept on the hip
And still walk away from it no matter the evidence
They killed MLK for peace talk
So why was you shocked when Zimmerman walked
So you can see why we go and protest at town hall
But face it, thy only court they'll let us win in is basketball

[Hook 3x]
