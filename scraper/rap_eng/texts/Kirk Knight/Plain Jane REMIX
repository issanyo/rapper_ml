[Intro: Nicki Minaj, B insta G, A$AP Ferg]
It's lit!
Young Money
Shout out A$AP Mob
Ayo Ferg
Yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Herm√®s link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'mma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I fuck yo bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo hoe if yo bitch keep eyein' me

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane
Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

[Post-Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Yeah)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (You already know, Harlem)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens)
Suck a nigga dick or somethin' (Queens for the Kings of the Queens)
