Didn't you hear me dog?
Do you hear me?
Coming from Brooklyn
Yo

I ain't gonna front thought I was scoring
Since I escorted damn
So keep the lean pouring
I just wanna feel the room and I'm a put my clothes on
Before I hear another excuse like "I ain't really ready
And I don't want to rush"
So I was like "I don't give fuck I'm off it"
She tried to pull me back back down
Cause if you play with bananas
I gotta bring the mac out
And that's the end of the clip
Hopped out and dip
Walking home I'm just trying to figure out why I'm so alone
Cause just about everybody I come in contact like
"Why you always chattin?" or "Why you not maccin?"
Or everything I do is wrong or in the wrong approach
So let me roll the roach
Swisher twister now I'm somewhere in the stars
Hey hey just thinking
Why my head can't be straight like the lines on my keyboard?
Why everybody on me for?
And I guess I treat my girlfriend like that cause I'm coldhearted
But how can I if I never had a heart to start with?
I'm over exaggerating I'm just sayin'
How can I play ball and I ain't never played it?
And that's a fact
Like a dime domination
I'm just saying everybody moving up
And I'm at square one cause people hold me back
Like a strap on a bag like a snap on a hat like a trap to a rat
Man I wish this was a dream
In reality nobody mad it me
And my music touches everybody soul
Like Kirk you that new nigga that everybody bump
But for now just bump
Knock your head understand
Like this shit is abusive you know I'm the man ah ah ah yo
I just want people to feel me tonight
So a little bit of loco make you feel alright
So I'm a just dream all night hey hey all night
I just wanna chill and drink with my niggas
Slip to an odyssey take a trip nigga
I'm a just dream all night
Hey hey all night
Hey hey all night
Hey hey all night
Hey hey all night
