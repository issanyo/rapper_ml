[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yo peace to all the mu' fuckin' gods man
Mic check one two one two
Shout all that wack shit man
Mic check, mic check one, two one two
Pro Era's on the rise man, 93 till infinity
Mic check one two, one two
Cut all that wack shit in my trinity
My vicinity, the mic check of the gods

[Verse 1: Nyck Caution]
Check!
This the interlude, let me enter you
Kush and dinner food, got me feelin' cool
Let me drop the pheromone
Ey, can you feel the groove?
We at the studio and every night it be the same shit like a interview
Twistin' up alot, she fixin' up her crotch
Got the lean and ciroc for the dream that I got
I made it a reality, salary stock
Gon' expand like a galaxy, foamin' if you battle, sea
I move out start my aim, live
Right here at the highest point, science can't explain shit
So pack a frame clip, thats movin' pictures
Cause my movin' picture got you entertwined like a movin' picture
The mood is wicked, like those movie witches
And the bank ain't the only thing that gon' show me interest, right?
And theres no tellin' what its worth
When I'm gone I ain't dead, I just fell up off the earth

[Bridge: Nyck Caution]
(Pop The Switch!)
Brace yourself and get live
And we gonna make ourself through that light
Pace your health and get high
The limit ain't the sky, the limit is disguised
A cracked safe where my sanity is
I ain't a clone even though I wear a factory trim
Like them
Hangin' on, bandage to skin
Eventually we lose our grip

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
WOOOOO!
We the mad men of survival
Who's my rival? Get snatched up for your title
No I do, I do no life recycle
Breathe
