[Intro: Sample and T'nah Apex]
I consider myself a storyteller
I'm a writer, I'm a producer, I'm an author
I'm an actor, I'm a director
Let be able to go into these different worlds is very powerful for me
So I love to work
I don't know any other way
Part of it in the beginning was
I was running from poverty
I thought
Everything's messed up
I don't know what to do, where to go or look
Who I am?
Has to be
Pure
I'll get it, just patience
Work, earn, learning
Will he ever see to perceive me as other than pure

[Hook]
So check me in God (check me in, check me in)
Check me in God
To your gates, to your heaven, to your hymns God
Check me in, check me in
Check me in God
The streets dissect me by the limb
Check me in God (check me in, God)
To your gates, to your heaven, yo your hymns God
Check me in, check me in

[Verse 1]
Give me your soul, give me your beat
Give me everything I need just to unleash the beast
Darkest angel, but I come in peace
I flew over heads, I'm a traveling man
One sick motherfucker with a way fare plan
To eliminate the feeling of the devil on my shoulders
I remain a soldier, starving artist with composure
If X  marks the spot, give me three X's
Bare strength, hands like I hold them
More or less I mold them
I even turn my actions into diamonds if I smould 'em
Not a Simpson, but finally felt what home is
And my spirit needs fine tuning
A caveman and I'm finally a Conan
Ayo Peter, I'm also a Family Guy
So please, would you just let me in  the house tonight
I know the night is young and a nigga was still taking baby steps
Until the light, struck and everything became radiant

[Hook]
So check me in God (check me in, check me in)
Check me in God
To your gates, to your heaven, to your hymns God
Check me in, check me in
Check me in God
The streets dissect me by the limb
Check me in God (check me in, God)
To your gates, to your heaven, to your hymns God
Check me in, check me in

[Verse 2]
I'm just pleading for the right, my nigga
To walk heaven grasses and be alright, my nigga
Narrow my vessel like a Vascular constrictor
I'm the agent that was sent from rags to riches
To rise in pitches, but life's hard
I could really argue my linguistics of this shit
Who really are you to judge a man
Tryna make it in this day and age, G
Don't expect silver spoons the way I was raised
Tear ducts dried up, some people walk in the rain
Others get wet, I show you how to walk with the pain
Imperfect world, I'm an angel, the same
Same sin that was on Paul trying to make a name
Look, now I'm a ghostwriter like I'm Nicolas Cage
And the enemies and friends I couldn't mention a thing
I left behind a whole life just to turn a new page
Now I'm just trying to show you the ways

[Hook]
So check me in God (check me in, check me in)
Check me in God
To your gates, to your heaven, to your hymns God
Check me in, check me in
Check me in God
The streets dissect me by the limb
Check me in God (check me in, God)
To your gates, to your heaven, yo your hymns God
Check me in, check me in

[Outro: T'nah Apex]
All you [?] try to lie demands and offerings
But it has to be pure, be infinite
Like me and me
All you [?] try to lie demands and offerings
But it has to be pure, be infinite
Like me and me
