[Verse 1]

Paradise, Imagination
Imagine a spacing where my thoughts become illuminated
But what's that motivation, probably being the most hated
But hatred can be your downfall into most places
The highest ark get destroy by water, cocaine
Daddys, able body fathers, why bother?
I see corruption on every fucking street corner
How would i start my morning?
Grab a bag of weed, and inhale and exhale as i fill my soul
Holy smoke Matthew couldn't see this indo
Before info with this nympho
I would assure my innocence and become a rebel militant
Gather like Kindle but in fact just thoughts of sixteen year old boy
In the immature world in filled with diamonds and pearls
Infused by the government and domestic girls
Come take a tour of no mans land and
No man in the body of ice created by cold shoulders
Given to you in life
Taking shots of penicillin to cure the fear this ride....right

[Hook]
It's amazing
It's amazing
It's amazing
What's reality to you my friend
Tune the picture your frequencies
And come into this early hiatus (Hiatus)
Early hiatus (Hiatus)
Early hiatus (Hiatus)
Early hiatus (Hiatus)

[Verse 2]

Pondering from situations
Relaxing this meditation
I'm just saying ventilation
But in fact, you people that said i slack
Surrounded by your body of egotistic go-getters
That would do anything to go green and see that pussy wetter
How we taught to live as one but have our own agendas
Black on Black crime prime time while we sitting here
Worrying about each others wife trife niggas owing
And we fucking still paying rent
How them other niggas thinking large and I'm still thinking bout sex
Balancing my thirteen chakras understand this bet
With the man up just let my guardians take me to this hiatus
The pearly gates of this far fetched land debating
These scholars on they intellect seeing through my polar vision
Often makes you tense well lets get past the fact they off they step
Taking meals for sixteen years how you gon tell me bout this shit
Now tell me why ignorance is fucking bliss

[Hook]
