[Intro]
"The scene from Comedy/Teen film Scary Movie (2000), where Phil jumps off the school roof while Anna Faris aka Cindy Campbell yells out 'What are you waiting for?' and spins around frantically."

[Hook: TD Francis] (x2)
Sorry for the wait
But it take time to be great
Sorry for the wait ok
Sorry for the wait ok


[Verse 1: NUFF$AID]
Yeah
Sorry for the wait
But it take time to be great
When my brother got shot
The ambulance was hella late
Puttin' pressure on the wound
I watched the blood coagulate
We both shared the same womb
So I didn't hesitate
The bullet almost hit his dome
Thank God it wasn't accurate
Cops said your brother was a thug
But why the pig exaggerate
Got, one misdemeanor
Burger King ain't hirin'
So he run got the nina
And he got to firin'
It's lit homie
Like a candle on a dinner date
Got your nigga's mixtape
Sittin' on my dinner plate
At any rate
I'll reiterate for all y'all illiterate
My bars incinerate, humiliate and then obliterate
I'm killin' wack ass rappers
Like I'm tryna up the murder rate
These niggas high on stage rappin'
It sound like niggas yodellin'
I kill the competition
And I kill the horse that rode him in
Y'all need to get the fuck up out my house
Y'all niggas loiterin'
Word!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: NUFF$AID]
Sorry for the wait ok
I been tryna pave a way
I been livin' check to check
Got some shit on layaway
Livin' in the struggle
Tryna make it out from day to day
Forgot to eat my breakfast
But I ain't forget to pray today
I had a flu like MJ
Still hit them hoes with that fade away
My dress code on Dana Dane
My punchlines on Damon Wayans
My kick game on Liu Kang
My bitch game on Bruce Wayne
My paper game on news stand
Them Balmains
That's loose change
Touch me you lose brains
Fuck beatings and bruisings
My goonses will have your ass
Leakin' and oozin'
Ski masked up and laughing
Just for amusement
Cuz you the stupid nigga
All these hoes be bamboozlin'
No wonder why you losin'
You should drown in your confusion
And I have just proven
That you seein' me
That was just an illusion

[Hook]
