[Intro: TheMIND]
The rose lay in dead tombs
But please walk the catacombs
Letâ€™s see the fallen kings
Pray we don't die alone
One night can last a lifetime
Brought Cleopatra home
We had a one night stand
Woke up and conquered Rome
(Conquered Rome)

[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Seen it with my opticle
Hopped on the scene like an obstacle
And I'm looking 'round the joint, yeah that [?]
Baby, how much are you move? Impossible
I'm like, damn
Probably need a monocle
And I'm feeling prime time, yeah the odds is cool
So, let me just scoot right next to you
And I know that my moves feeling optimal
I said
What's the fear of our desire?
Our chemistry spell desire
Sooner or later the lust will find us
Chanel, MAC lip, all types of designers
So let me design this
We still striking together, oh my god
It's a perfect match
Defying your eyes
I can fathom how God made your ass here
I'm like
You addicted? Well I'm dope, I mean
So let's increase that shit
Like I never [?] when I'm in the scenes
I go down
Baby I know you
Looking like mine in a night gown
But in a tight dress
You got a Brooklyn nigga obsessed
Left fear at the door with the swank
No regrets

[Hook: Kirk Knight] x2
Seen you at this party
Surrounded by all your friends
I said "Baby, what's happening?"
She said "I don't want no man"
I said girl, just listen
This just my one night stand and
She said who the fuck are you?
Your knight in shining, understand
Damn

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]
Shit, looks can be deceiving
But I'm glaring at the one
Fell so hard kinda landed on my spot
Get touched like Omarion
Get your party on
Little bit of audience
To get your naughty on
Love in the air but your maskin'
You looking like you got a little secret
And a gentleman is just asking
If I, tap it for, one night
Beauty only skin deep
So poke right
Stroke to the strobe light
Dead wrong but it feel right
Out of sight when I hear the bassline
Did it
Maybe just a little deep with this
Only human nature that I'm watching
Mind, body and soul
And your body is banging
Crips and Bloods
And now they swear if you're a little gang related
Damn
Too much, had to say it
On occasion if that's blazing
Then your [?] heat
And your fluid saved me
She respond "You so crazy, baby"
I can tell
Tension was neck to neck
Sucked the life out a nigga in a triple set
Tipsy off the edge when I hit the set
Now I'm always playing hard to get
Damn

[Hook: Kirk Knight] x2

Twist your words so you can curve (him like, him like) x2
Twist your words so you can curve, curve (him like, him like)
Twist your words so you can curve (him like, him like)
Twist your words so you can curve, curve (him like, him like) x2
Twist your words so you can curve (him like, him like) x2
(Him like, him like)
