[Chorus]
I tell 'em, "I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag" (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Yeah)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil's)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, can't be a hot boy when you make those moves up off that burner
Hangin' on for my niggas, felt like Nat Turner
Always had heart, abnormal murmur
Cold shoulders made the fire in that heart warmer
I burn the sensation for better accommodation
Like my money had ash outside, need to see it cakin'
That's why I kept it short and sweet, sell Percs up through streets
No bank account, slide that money under my momma sheets
Can't let my bloodline become these blood suckers
Keepin' high hopes no matter what pressure I'm under
Always on the go, I'm guessin' I'm a distant lover
Eager, the bones so hard, you can't ignore the brother

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, "I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag" (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Yeah)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil's)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)

[Verse 2]
Since a baby, a nigga been crib hoppin'
I'm just tryna stack this money just to get the crib poppin'
Pops went missin', like I only seen him on milk cartons
So it's Percs and weed, hide it in my favorite Jordans
So it's "walk with me," if you tryna place an order
'Cause these cops is fleas, they be really tryna dawg a nigga
Like why you tryna frame me, boy? I'm tryna paint a picture
Tried to force a nigga hand and make me pull this trigger
But back on Lenox Ave. and church, I sold my first Perc
Back when Porter water used to quench a nigga thirst
Me and Rell in the field, that's a task force
Like we need more than a mil' on our dashboards

[Chorus]
I tell 'em, "I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag" (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Yeah)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil's)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
And I won't stop until I hit millions in cash (Mil)
I feel like I live my life out this duffle bag (Duffle bag)
