[Chrous]
Ride with the team, Yadadamean
Name on my neck—lace full of beads
Sniffin' the air, havoc what I wreak
When they drop the beat, get hyphy

[Verse 1]
Who dat boy dat rollin' in?
Shanga Goman going in
Mollywhop the instrumental, I just need some ink and pen
Red Lantern Atrocitus, lyrical apocalypse
Chuckin' up the dub, I rep the region where 2Pac had lived
East Bay, O-A-K, that's what I maintain
Black and brown bidness out of town bidness
All of our bidness lookin' plain jane
Panthers and protestors, they pushin' for prosperity
Policemen and politicians stay poachin' so they can't succeed:
Brothers and sisters slain
Streets flooded with crack cocaine
Now they got 'em gathered in tents like they camping
My campaign is that we need some damn change
Ancestors guiding me to make the moves to rearrange
Deep or depressed: SG plantain
Machete mind cuttin’ 'em down like sugar cane
Seed planting, it comes back full circle
Intelligent movement arising revolution, not the first though

[Chrous x2]
Ride with the team, Yadadamean
Name on my neck—lace full of beads
Sniffin' the air, havoc what I wreak
When they drop the beat, get hyphy

[Post-Chorus]
(Ride with the team, Yadadamean)
Find me mobbin' with my clique or somethin'
(Ride with the team, Yadadamean)
Mobbin' with my clique or somethin'
(Ride with the team, Yadadamean)
Find me mobbin' with my clique or somethin'
(Ride with the team, Yadadamean)
Mobbin' with my clique or somethin'

[Verse 2]
Told my bro at the DAMN. tour
That one day I would have my own damn tour
I’m my own oracle can’t nobody stop me
I'm sellin' out the Oracle whole city come and watch me (watch me)
Wrists on plain jane, kept losing all my watches
Make up for lost time until I am a fossil
Beat bang, head swang, thang sound colossal
Put it on self said, “Go off fam, ya gots to!!”
Pull up like a monster
Young Money was the roster
Realness, real spit, ain't no imposters
Charged up, bossed up, no time for awkward
You got the sauce, but I put mine out with the pastas
I’m going Ryu and Ken
One day show Ryu and Ken
How I just handle these words and the way I be moving in:
Round, front, back, side, side kicks, take two steps in
Cross, jab, elbow, hook, and a Shoryuken
That's a fatality, I stay casually killing all of these flows, you
Can’t fathom the way my patterns be drillin' through the floors, and
Brandon’s father said be like water, so believe that Imma erode, it's the
Earth shaker, give him some paper and it's murder whatever he wrote
Told the fam I got 'em, best believe that Imma spot 'em
Khaled said buy some houses, believe that Imma cop 'em
I’m castin' this lightning like Palpatine
So when I hit the top then I can look eye to eye with my parents from their balcony

Ride with the team, Yadadamean
Name on my neck—lace full of beads
Sniffin' the air, havoc what I wreak
When they drop the beat, get hyphy
Ride with the team, Yadadamean
Name on my neck—lace full of beads
Sniffin' the air, havoc what I wreak
I murk the beat, get Kirk, it's deceased
