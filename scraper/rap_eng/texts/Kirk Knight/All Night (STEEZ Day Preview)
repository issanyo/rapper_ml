[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
We at lost try [?] bank cards
Live fast, die young tryna get far
No bitch, my whip not a rental
Got rich off these instrumentals
Then I throw a little knowledge for the mental
For them niggas tryna catch him in his Benz slow
Niggas can't really see it like the tint's on
New drug what you been on? Let's get it

[Verse 2: Nyck Caution]
Since PEEP everything dropped influential
Been a beast, what the fuck I got to pretend for?
Check the show footage on the down around the world
Went to your event, shit was uneventful
Kirk quarterback, meet me in the end zone
Promise y'all don't want it
Any doubt in the air, shit, oh well, toss it
Bring it down anywhere, call me Odell Caution

[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
And we feeling ourselves, so don't do this often
When you cruise the night you'll proceed with caution
Tax free so the boy man I'll build your coffin
Front, get backhand like a U.S. Open
Never follow suit, 'cause my boys behind me
Haters always watch, know it's perfect timing
Said they ain't did, but they know they lying
Kill another show, crowd scream "Caught a body!"
Worldwide nigga, man let's have a party
Girls swinging tongue sweet serenade
They ask if I drink, I tell 'em "hardly"
Nigga [?] and some lemonade
Just got back to my apartment
She tellin' me her friends is on the way
Girl, take your shoes off my carpet
Just know you never good for a change

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
And we do this baby like, all night, every night
And my team riding with me like, all night, every night
All this green got me feeling right, all night, every night
Got some bad bitches with me like, all night every night
And we do this baby like, all night, every night
And my team riding with me like, all night, every night
All this green got me feeling right, all night, every night
Got some bad bitches with me like, all night every night

[Verse 4: Nyck Caution & Kirk Knight]
Been a minute since it was a game
And you feeling away
And I ain't never been the same
Got a picture to paint
I'm the heir to the throne
Man stay in your lane
You the king to the king, get slain
Still I feel like there's more to life
I wrote lines eight years, still more to write
It gets dark, sometimes I ignore the light
And my mama to rap, mortified
Yeah everybody live, but we born to die
That's why we get it done, we can't afford the time
Fortify I got stronger, wasn't even tryna go to war, I'm a Gorgo knight
But if I got to fight, I'mma slaughter right
You touch the fam', attack like Coraline
Fuck the bag, I put a body in it, my last name what it show is a warning sign
Start late, finish by the morning time
Nyck @ Knight, lil' Jesse, Kirk Walter White
Energy looking like I'm off the white
White kids like to call me awesome, right
Off the wall, I put it all aside
And I got to run the city ain't no cake walk
'cause all that sweet talk, we ain't got no reply
We off the grid with no days off

[Hook: Nyck Caution]
And we do this baby like, all night, every night
And my team riding with me like, all night, every night
All this green got me feeling right, all night, every night
And some bad bitches with me like, all night every night
And we do this baby like, all night, every night
And my team riding with me like, all night, every night
All this green got me feeling right, all night, every night
And some bad bitches with me like, all night every night
