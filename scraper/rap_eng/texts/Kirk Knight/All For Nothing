[Verse 1]
13 like Mississippi in the slave state
Stay slated to win
My witness blowing up
Got to maintain with the same slang
Same walk, nothing changed but the campaign
Use my mental like a metal itâ€™s a honor
I'm feeling bless the sky is not the limit
My talent is calling
God told me go ahead and do the best you can
You can't buy attention, you got to earn it
Young dust, young dust, still earning
Incense keep burning
Just saying this all could be for nothing
Too much to dream like excessive alcoholics
My addiction to this passion is impressing
That's the fruit of my label


Child's play, not a joker, nigga figure it out
On the robot 15, 16, 17 work
Nigga, I never felt the cotton colored shirts
It was only mountain gear
Nigga never had the perks
Nice as the drugs
Make it spoil, make it worse
But what if you came from the  dirt
Never less of a man
Understand situations at hand
But I still feel at hurt
If you feel me go on, say the words

[Hook (x2)]
This could be all for nothing
I did it all on my own
Niggas never showed ropes
Niggas just showed me the road

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the dark
Making fire to spark interest
Percentages and market prices that was invented
Venting qualms, living life like it's my last expenses
Powers in the pen
So each bar that I write goes for all of my kids, dem
16 a got a nigga got more dead than alive
Trial and error
But my 30 been ups and downs
Who am I now, twenty one questions
And no love, you no love found
Nigga, I'm next again
After current events, it was so evident
That it is evidence
Since they turned into nemesis
Look what's my back against
Back to back, self again
I don't know who to trust
Enter myself again
They had it pull me in
Every time I circle, pants up like Urkel
Flow ready to hurt you
But then again, all for nothing?
Like a dealer with the bad reggie
Now what am I supposed to do with all this work
Is there a worth for what's a dollar to a dream
Everything watchu mean, penny for your thoughts
Penny for your schemes, even [?] you gotta pay for it
Coming out the pocket, this time still antsy
Related to be, so when they ask me to reminisce
You can only catch a nigga just slanting

[Hook (x2)]
I said, this could be all for nothing
I did it all on my own
Niggas never showed ropes
Niggas just showed me the road

[Outro]
I did it, I did it, I did it
All on my own
