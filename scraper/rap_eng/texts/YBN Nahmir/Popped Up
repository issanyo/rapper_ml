[Chorus: Lul G]
Young nigga, so I gotta keep the Glock tucked
Keep a MAC that'll work a nigga block up
What the fuck you niggas saying, we'll pop up
Book your ass for that show and get you popped up
What the fuck you niggas dissing on these songs for
Jack who you out the way but we keep poles
Pass lil bro the chopper, watch you take souls
Hundred rounds in this bitch, make you lay low

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
I got a Glock and it hold thirty, knock a nigga down
That's for you pussy niggas loafing while you out of bounds
Fuck all that talking lil bitch, we gon' air it out
Hit a nigga block up, we gon' lay him down
Two Glocks lil nigga so that's sixty shots
Make a nigga turf hot when his body drop
Bounce out with that chop, make him Milly Rock
Rocking with that nigga G, 'cause he keep a mop
Ayy, niggas faking like they on some'
Quick to pop out on a bitch that ain't know none'
Ayy, what's a Glock to your lil gun?
Chopper kicking, get to spitting like he rev run
Ain't no nigga ever said shit to my face
Niggas Twitter typing, Instagramming, hella gay
Niggas tryna make a diss for a lil fame
But when them pussy niggas die, I ain't the one to blame

[Chorus: Lul G]
Young nigga, so I gotta keep the Glock tucked
Keep a MAC that'll work a nigga block up
What the fuck you niggas saying, we'll pop up
Book your ass for that show and get you popped up
What the fuck you niggas dissing on these songs for
Jack who you out the way but we keep poles
Pass lil bro the chopper, watch you take souls
Hundred rounds in this bitch, make you lay low

[Verse 2: Lul G]
Uh, nigga, lay low
Feds tapping in, lil nigga lay low
Niggas speaking on tour, I leave your face swole
Hundred rounds in this bitch, that's a case closed
Keep talking, it's gon' be another kick door
Ain't no dissing, taking trips, me and four four
Niggas flexing for them vids, you don't tote poles
Doing shows for a fifty where you can't go
He'll bounce out and let a nigga have it
What the fuck you niggas mean, born a savage
Niggas talking on the net, no action
Still Harden niggas, still rockin' with this plastic

[Chorus: Lul G]
Young nigga, so I gotta keep the Glock tucked
Keep a MAC that'll work a nigga block up
What the fuck you niggas saying, we'll pop up
Book your ass for that show and get you popped up
What the fuck you niggas dissing on these songs for
Jack who you out the way but we keep poles
Pass lil bro the chopper, watch you take souls
Hundred rounds in this bitch, make you lay low
