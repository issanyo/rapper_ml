[Intro: Asian Doll]
Brrr
Ayy, YBN shit, YBN shit
Doll gang shit
Ayy, hold up
(Heal)

[Verse 1: Asian Doll]
Big benz, big body, all my thotties friends
I ain't rockin' with these niggas, I got dead friends
All these diamonds around my neck, give me sickle cell
Asian Doll, I'm a savage, I'm so fuckin' ill
Put a Glock in your mouth, like a Tic Tac
Pussy boy, tried to run up, gott geta back
Draco hold a hundred, it ain't got no kick back
Sneak dissin' on the net, get your wig snatched

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
Four cars, four houses, nigga, for me
I was loaded, 4AM, we was four deep
Was feelin' good, so I went and copped a Rollie
These niggas tryna take my shine, I can't get cozy
Like I'm Casper, I'm the creep of the community
These rappers funny, 'cause they really think they losin' me
They need to stop it, need to stop all that buffoonery
A lot of money, and I spend that shit like usually

[Verse 3: Asian Doll]
Headspin, like a fan, money rubber band
For my nigga I'ma sin, lost my brother to the Pen'
Fucked up, cruisin' in a Tesla, now my check is up
Finesse a nigga like a burglar, can't chill, ain't regular
Real bitch from the south, and I'm reekin' like a pound
She don't like me, word to mouth
Asian knockin' bitches down

[Verse 4: YBN Nahmir]
High as a kite, ain't no flight, playin' for my life
Bitch thought she couldn't get the hands, 'cause she was a dyke
You chillin' at the house, sittin' broke, eatin' dinner pies
I'm prolly at the crib, eatin' steaks, like my nigga Clyde
Wednesdays, I change the Gucci to LV
I'm the man, it ain't shit that you could tell me
I'm Bah Humbug, lil' nigga, even with this money
Like how you walkin' around, looking bum and dusty?

[Verse 5: Asian Doll]
Ayy, bitch, why you talkin', postin' evidence?
Scared when the lights come out, they comin', better check your best
Freddy Krueger creepin' up, my Ruger, main bitch a shooter
Hopscotch, playin' with them dukas, hit medulla
Hunnid bands, on some clothes, I'ma get that
Ballin' with no budget, JuJu Gang so she gon' spin that
Take a nigga, selfish, other bitch ain't get no big racks
14 in the trap, auntie had me sellin' packs
Ridin' with my seat back, Draco got no kickback
Your nigga in my house up on his knees, I broke his Kit-Kat
Word to my mother, if you see me, better spin that
Bitch, you ain't a gangsta, tryna prove it in them big facts
Thinkin' big facts, I drop on the ice a stack
Jewelers on my line, they wanna flood me, it's a big sack
I don't fight, choppa with a knife, hit you out of spite
Nahmir get to fightin', change up on 'em, niggas want the hype (Brr, bitch)
