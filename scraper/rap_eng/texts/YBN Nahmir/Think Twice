Yessir
Ooh

[Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
Pull up in a Rari, can't drive it (yeah)
She want the dick, can't ride it (ooh)
Droppin' the bag and hide it (yeah)
Two-toned diamond (yeah)
Ooh, I got some ice
Fuck her once, I don't wanna fuck twice
Freaky bitch, ride the dick like a bike
Kick her out, tell that hoe take a hike
Pull up in a Rari, can't drive it (yeah)
She want the dick, can't ride it (ooh)
Droppin' the bag and hide it (yeah)

Fuck her once, I don't wanna fuck twice
Freaky bitch, ride the dick like a bike
Kick her out, tell that hoe take a hike

[Verse 1: YBN Almighty Jay]
Kick her out, make that hoe take a Lyft
Broke bitch workin' a double shift
I run with the bag you fumble it
I pick up the cash and thumb through it (yah)
Yeah, she playing games (games)
I put the Masi in two lanes
I spent a bag on a new chain
She got a real ass but her boobs fake (bitch)
