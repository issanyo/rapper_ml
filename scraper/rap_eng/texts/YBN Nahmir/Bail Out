Bro ready to bail around
Bail out too, nigga (on my mama)

[Verse]
Bitch you know I got guala
Stackin' these chips, I be gettin' these commas
Choppers hit 'em and they partners
Fuck they mama right in front of they father
AR bullets hit a nigga
My niggas really pullin' triggers
We pop out the cut and we sendin' them shots
No we not talkin' to niggas
Bitch I'm the shit, I cannot be no dummy
I'm fuckin' yo' bitch while I'm gettin' this money
Stacked up, and that clip it hold forty
I'm sendin' them shots if you callin' me shorty
FN, it came with a 30
If you try me nigga, I'mma do you dirty
Curb service, and I shoot like Curry
And the bullets rippin' through a nigga jersey
All about commas, we with the drama
Boy, we be ridin' Impalas
You slide to the ville, you gettin' yo' haircut, my broski, he hit at yo' barber
Cuffin' these bitches, boy you be drawling, know that lil' bitch she got mileage
R.I.P. Valley, we so turnt up, all of my niggas be wildin'
Keep it a stack for you niggas, who fraudin' and flexin' and lying in raps
Not from the trenches, roaches and rats, boy they be bigger than cats
No we not fightin' you niggas, we pullin' with choppers and ARs and MACs
Yellin' free Frank, we turnt up lil' nigga, until that lil' nigga get back

[Hook]
We come to your block and we air it out
Yellin' free all my niggas, just let 'em out
30 clip hit a nigga for standing out
We finessin' the plug and we bailin' out
We come to your block and we air it out
Yellin' free all my niggas, just let 'em out
30 clip hit a nigga for standing out
We finessin' the plug now we bailin' out
We bail out, whoa

Yellin' free all my niggas, just let 'em out
30 clip hit a nigga for standing out
