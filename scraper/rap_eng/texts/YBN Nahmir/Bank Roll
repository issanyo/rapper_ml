[Intro: KiingRod]
Man you broke ass niggas ain't never had a bank roll

[Chorus: KiingRod]
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)

[Verse 1: KiingRod]
New foreign's back to back, 'cause we countin' like that
I just blew through the bag, but I made it right back
I don't got the same worries but I still watch my back
Fuck niggas still plottin', we ain't worried 'bout that
Got these broke niggas mad 'cause I stay in my bag
Got these bum bitches trippin', 'cause I will not hit back
I'ma need a hundred stacks, 'fore I hit it from the back
I ain't worried 'bout you I'm in love with the racks
Got the stash at the crib I don't fuck wit' the bank
Keep the one's in the whip, I'ma use 'em for the tank
Don't try and keep up 'cause you can't maintain
Stack yo' bread lil' nigga stop tryna switch lanes (bitch)

[Chorus: KiingRod]
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
Man you lil' ass nigga's ain't never saw shit (ayy)
Drop the top on the Porche I might crash in that whip
I say, Rod you know we got these lil' niggas mad
'Cause we pushin' all these foreign's and we countin' all this cash
Ayy, Cuban links, Glock on me, drinkin' Hennessy
Let a nigga play wit' me then I'm sparkin' 'em
Ain't no talkin' in that car, no we sparkin' it
At his body, now they outline chalkin' it
Low key, lately a nigga been low key
You know I'm never lackin' I can't let a nigga rob me
Straight flock in, you know them bodies droppin'
Talkin' dead on the net then you know I gotta pop 'em
I got two chains on and my buffs on bitch (buffs on bitch)
All them diss songs, still ain't bust on shit (still ain't bust on shit)
Seen 'em type in all caps so he mad then a bitch (so he mad then a bitch)
Man these nigga's bankrupt, they ain't gettin' into the chips

[Chorus: KiingRod]
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)
Keep a bank roll wit' me, 20's, 50's, blue hundreds
I'ma keep chasin' money 'til my heart stop runnin' (gang)
Never lookin' back now, got my mind on the hundreds
Ain't no stoppin' us now, we done blew through a hundred (bitch)
