[Verse 1: NickyBaandz]
Bitch, time to run it up
Pour a deuce in that Fanta I don't give a fuck
Riding with my nigga Ques bitch[?]
Niggas talkin' down when [?] gonna fuck him up
Stretch a nigga out with that glizzy he's elastic
He on the ground lookin' like Mr. Fantastic
Swervin' up in traffic [?]
Glock hold 10 times 3 like mathematics
Nahmir run up back with the chop' pack a nigga out
Niggas talkin' down 'cause you shout what you yappin 'bout
Niggas say I'm broke, thats the shit I be laughin' 'bout
Like a bitch on her period, nigga, I be actin' out
Two .40's in the whip [?]
Slide down

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
Four Fizzy on my hip, you know Nicky got the blower
Run up on a nigga we gon' hit him in his shoulder
Bitch I'm hella geekin' turn me on like a motor
Lil bitch tried to fuck but her pussy got a odor
30 clip on a stick imma off that
Put a price on your neck get your chain snatched
Lil bitch run it up get my dope back
Strip your ass for your clothes we'll take all that
Pole hangin' out in public, nigga, fuck it
I don't give no fucks 'cause you know a nigga thuggin'
Sike a pussy nigga out if i'm thinkin' that he muggin'
Lil bitch tried to touch on my buff then I'm bustin'
Say, I just wanna fuck, I don't wanna talk
Pour a deuce in my cup, got me noddin' off
Lil Nigga think we sweet like some cotton soft
I up this big chop' get your body lost
Watch how I rock out with the pole
Try to touch on my bro imma let it blow
Smoke dope and you know I fuck hella hoes
I'm that nigga in my city just to let you know
I ain't never been no pussy, get that understood
Try to diss me on a song, I wish a nigga would
We'll pull up on his turf like a nigga should
We'll amp that bitch out bro what's really good
Nigga I ain't never switch up
Niggas talkin' down they must want to get they shit bust
