My mom tatted on my arm, 'cause she mean a lot
I ain't never had no dad, never had no pops
I was always on that block, clutching on that Glock
Only way you leave the gang if it's in a box
Hard nights, it was cold, we ain't have no heat
And my bro passed away, I was sixteen
Had to get off my ass and get off in 'em streets
We ain't even have no water in that fucking sink
But now I'm up and I'm a stay focused and get the paper
Had to get my money up, rocking with the stainless
Any nigga disrespect, brother he gon' spank him
And I ain't playing with these niggas, leave a nigga dangerous
Stitched lips, be quiet, don't say shit
Stick together, that's how my little niggas made it
And I ain't fucking with no bitch if she basic
She ain't fucking for the free, this a fee for this famed dick
Fuck
