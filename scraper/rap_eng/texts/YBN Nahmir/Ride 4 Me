Bounce out baby come and show you you gon' ride for me
Don't need no average chick just want one who gon' ride for me
And when I'm gone my baby girl, ye she gon' cry for me
She always keep it hunda, I guarantee you she won't lie to me
Bounce out baby come and show you you gon' ride for me
Don't need no average chick just want one who gon' ride for me
And when I'm gone my baby girl, ye she gon' cry for me
She always keep it hunda, I guarantee you she won't lie to me

[Verse 1]
And I can't trust these niggas (ay ay)
And I can't trust these bitches
Nigga speakin' on lil valley and Imma shoot that nigga
I'm only seventeen I bounce out with the ruler nigga
I've been coolin' for a minute, in my fuckin' bag
Niggas making diss songs, that shit was hella wack
Niggas dissing for the clout, they wanna diss back
But when the [?] on they put up with they bitch ass
Valley this and Valley that, nigga pull up
We in your section we ain't worried about your shooters
I catch you lackin' on my mumma Imma do you
Got my girl up on the sidey and she clutching on that Ruger

Bounce out baby come and show you you gon' ride for me
Don't need no average chick just want one who gon' ride for me
And when I'm gone my baby girl, ye she gon' cry for me
She always keep it hunda, I guarantee you she won't lie to me
Bounce out baby come and show you you gon' ride for me
Don't need no average chick just want one who gon' ride for me
And when I'm gone my baby girl, ye she gon' cry for me
She always keep it hunda, I guarantee you she won't lie to me
