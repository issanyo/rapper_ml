[Intro: Evelyn "Champagne" King]
Get up off of your love, baby
Get up off of your love
Get up off of your love, baby (get up)
Get up off of your love
Koast!

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Ayy, I said I only want one night, but I ain't gon' spend the night (night)
I ain't lookin' for relations, I'm just giving pipe (ayy)
Want a foreign bad bitch, ride me like a bike (bike)
I just want to hit it once before I take a flight (flight)
I said I only want one night, but I ain't gon' spend the night (night)
I ain't lookin' for relations, I'm just giving pipe
Want a foreign bad bitch, ride me like a bike (ayy)
I just want to hit it once before I take a flight (take a flight, ayy, ayy)

[Verse: YBN Nahmir]
If it's quick I'ma fuck with my shoes on (grrah)
Early morning, getting dome with the news on (bitch)
Rock out, 17 with my True's on (True's on)
I never leave the house without a tool on (grrah)
On my mama, on my mama like I'm TO (like I'm TO)
Can't smoke, gotta watch for my PO (ayy)
Lame bitch traded rent for a freak hoe (freak hoe)
Super soaker, but she cheat like a CLEO
I said, baby bring it back for a real P (real P)
She gon' drop, probably faint when she see me
I'm that nigga that your bitch love to talk about (talk about, ayy)
Try me, hit your leg, make you walk it out (grrah)
If it's beef, know what's up, we ain't gon' talk it out
30 clip in this stick, knock a nigga down
Nerd niggas, they gon' hate, I'ma do me
Let a nigga touch me, leave him 6 deep
6 deep in your bitch, watch your bitch splash
Young nigga, flip a block up with no mask (ayy)
Lil Zeke tried to flip, caught a toe tag
Seen the whip, hit the lights then got on that
Let me stop before I speak too much info (info)
Lame niggas gettin' stripped, call me Deebo (call me Deebo)
Treat the trap like guitars, call me Tito (ayy)
I'ma float, YBN with my amigos (ayy, gang!)

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
I said I only want one night, but I ain't gon' spend the night (night)
I ain't lookin' for relations, I'm just giving pipe (ayy)
Want a foreign bad bitch, ride me like a bike (bike)
I just want to hit it once before I take a flight (flight, ayy)
I said I only want one night, but I ain't gon' spend the night (night)
I ain't lookin' for relations, I'm just giving pipe
Want a foreign bad bitch, ride me like a bike (ayy)
I just want to hit it once before I take a flight (take a flight, ayy, ayy)
