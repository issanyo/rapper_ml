[Intro]
Ooh, talk to me
Ooh, talk to me

[Verse]
Talk to me big bro, I'm really missing you a lot
Lately I've been on the road, getting to the guap
Man the shit's so fucked up, it's almost been two years
Every time I hear your name, bro I shred a tear
I'm still like "why did they had to take my bro from me?"
When I got that phone call I said "you joking me"
But it was real, heart attack, no, they wasn't lying
Hung up the phone, then I walked out and then I started crying
Yeah, it fucked me up I skipped school for a couple months
It fucked up Glizzy too, man we was having bad luck (bad luck)
Nigga said I changed, but I ain't really give a fuck (ain't give no fuck)
The night was stuck with me forever, boy my life was stuck
I'm really sad that you passed, I was really mad (I was mad)
But now I know you in the sky with your mum and dad
I ain't never had no dad, but you was like my dad
The day you died, man, my whole fucking life crashed

[Hook]
I'm now in a world, it's just me and you
I feel so lost, 'cause I don't know what to do
Now what if I choose, the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you
So I need to talk to you, and ask you for your guidance
Especially today, when my mind is so cloudy
Guide me until, until
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Ooh, talk to me
Ooh, talk to me
