[Chorus]
Niggas hating like some bitches swear to god they be lame
And if a nigga run up on me in my lane he get changed
I don't even gotta up it my lil bro blow his brains
In a cut hitting stains I'm just doing my thing
Niggas hating like some bitches swear to god they be lame
And if a nigga run up on me in my lane he get changed
I don't even gotta up it my lil bro blow his brains
In a cut hitting stains I'm just doing my thing

[Verse]
Say if I up it then I'm blowing ain't no talking we on it
Try to ride me in my house and you gon leave with a toe tag
Mista Dee he got the whip but he ain't buy it he stole it
Rolling off of that dope pack while I'm sipping that cognac
Nigga tried to bring me out my last lil boy you a bitch
If you ain't down with your niggas guarantee you a snitch
And if you running your lips well that's how niggas get killed
Shoot your body in that trunk and leave you dead in that ditch
I'm not playing with these niggas I'm spraying these niggas
30 in the clip ain't bang these niggas
Run off dope but I bet I won't choke like a lil ass kid I changed these niggas
I'm one hunnid lil nigga I never switch up if I heard you got signed then it's bet on your luck
Lil bitch you run up and I bet you get plugged
And I won't give no fuck

[Chorus]
Niggas hating like some bitches swear to god they be lame
And if a nigga run up on me in my lane he get changed
I don't even gotta up it my lil bro blow his brains
In a cut hitting stains I'm just doing my thing
Niggas hating like some bitches swear to god they be lame
And if a nigga run up on me in my lane he get changed
I don't even gotta up it my lil bro blow his brains
In a cut hitting stains I'm just doing my thing
