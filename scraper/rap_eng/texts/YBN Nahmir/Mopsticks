[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
We got them mopsticks in the back
Run up lil bitch, you get clapped
We holdin' on them straps
Pussy nigga, don't get whacked
We slidin' with that MAC
Tell go park around the back
My niggas carry guns, why you runnin' with a bat?
We slide down with that slide down
With them mopsticks, we don't play around
Slide down with that slide down
With them mopsticks, we don't play around
We slide down with that slide down
With them mopsticks, we don't play around
Slide down with that slide down
With them mopsticks, we don't play around

[Verse: YBN Nahmir]
That choppa, choppa, go rat-tat (grrah)
Catch a nigga lackin', push his cap back
I'm the man of my town, I ain't pave my way
But if a nigga got problem, he can die today
Lil bitch, we got .40's, and big K's
