[Intro]
That's it right there, Gnealz
Aye
Gang
Aye
Ooh, B-Bighead on the Beat

[Hook]
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it
AK-47 and it's automatic
Talk tough lil bitch, watch ya get the clapping
Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it
AK-47 and it's automatic
Talk tough lil bitch, watch ya get the clapping
Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm never lackin', I keep running yo head
That choppa bullet is gonna knock off yo leg
You run up on me, then i'm leaving you dead
I leave you dead, if you talk to the feds
Gotta watch yo back, cause these niggas be snakes
The money come, then these nigga turn fake
You play with me, they find you dead in the lake
Not like the wire, find you dead in the grave
I got a TEC-9, it came from Bagdad, so they gonna flag that
Uzi from San Francisco, my homie pass that
This Glock turn you to a zombie, it give you whiplash
Speedin' off in the Hemi, that make he crash that
I'm tatted up, watch me fuck on your bitch
I could fuck her even if you was rich
But if you rich, then I'm takin' yo shit
Say you the plug, then I takin' yo brick
Say on my life, I ain't running from shit
You think it's static till yo bro meet the clip
Little nigga talking, 30 shots at his lip
We catch him loafing, 30 shots at his whip

[Hook]
They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it
AK-47 and it's automatic
Talk tough lil bitch, watch ya get the clapping
Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic

They ain't stop making guns when they made yours
All ya niggas do is type on them keyboards
We’ll slide and knock you out with them big toys
All my niggas straight jumping, fucking kill Roy
We ain't really with the talking, we gon let em have it
AK-47 and it's automatic
Talk tough lil bitch, watch ya get the clapping
Make a nigga disappear like it was some magic
