[Verse]
Bitch I been untouched
I'm that same nigga
And I swear to God I will never change nigga
Got that blicky on my hip
It go bang nigga
Shoot a nigga right in his fucking brain nigga
You could feel that [?]
[?]
Everywhere I go, bitch I got that .40 Glock
Run up on me it's guaranteed that you getting popped
And I thank the lord for my blessings
Cause rapping is my fucking weapon
I don't even got to fight cause I keep the blick
Keep the barrel in his mouth then I scoop the fucking trigger
Man these streets cold, I don't really give a fuck
That's why I keep my cool and I don't ever duck
And if I catch a nigga lacking then he out of luck
Throw it in his head then leave his body in the fucking dump
Bitch I'm still hot
Your girl already know that's why she on my fucking cock
.44 up in that [?]
Niggas act so hard until they dumbass get shot
And I'm still on the block, ain't shit change
And my big bro just caught a big case
Watch em blow, watch them niggas get erased
Blow em like a candle, put that cake right in they face
Ya don't really know how it be like in them streets
Born in New Haven but now I'm down south with the heat
Pull up on niggas my niggas leave em six deep
Thinking do I want that Benz or the new Jeep
Bitch I feel like Pablo, no Skywalker
And my new shoes, bitch I be sky walking
And your main bitch, man that bitch stay calling
I'm the fucking man so that bitch stay talking
Bitch I'm a fucking boss
Hell nah I ain't gone fucking fall
See them cameras and the flashing lights
I got bands nigga fuck a price
Fucked yo bitch then passed her to the bro
Said what you smoking that's that fucking dro
And I be in it like I'm rich low
And bitches loaf gang so it's fuck the hoes
See I'm getting to the fucking bands
And one day I'm a count [?]
I be calling on the beast, chilling in the sand
With a bad bitch yeah and she gone hold my hand
