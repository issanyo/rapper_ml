[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Know I keep my circle small, couple niggas, couple brauds
Middle fingers to the law, middle fingers to the law
Pour up some drank, yeah, pour up some drank
Fuck all the fake, fuck all the fake
You know we gon ball together, hit the club and fuck it up together
You my nigga, you my dog forever
If you got beef, I'm involved, my nigga

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
Runnin up hot, but the block cold
Testin, I be runnin through potholes
Chicken and waffles like Roscoes
Blow through the paper, no snot nose
Live for the day, only god knows
White diamonds lookin like Charcole
Fly to Vegas, I did it, no favors
Show haters I buy paintings at art shows
Got a condo down in the state, left 20 bands on a plain
Air BNB for the gang, on the same street as Lil Wayne
She wanna break and fuck the child support
Got it covered, all across the board
So much Gucci, need a sponcer for it
All the family drippin sauce and water
I'm with the gang, still with m
Right on the cort, by the basket
Got a bitch with me, she classy
I call her Angela Bassi
Ball, my nigga, Bugatti and all, my nigga
Ten at the mall, my nigga
Fuck up the moola, surrounded by shooters, I did it for ya'll, my nigga

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Know I keep my circle small, couple niggas, couple brauds
Middle fingers to the law, middle fingers to the law
Pour up some drank, yeah, pour up some drank
Fuck all the fake, fuck all the fake
You know we gon ball together, hit the club and fuck it up together
You my nigga, you my dog forever
If you got beef, I'm involved, my nigga

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
Been a minute since the tape dropped, fuck a bitch, I can't cuff thots
Went from Rommon nudels, red socks
Now it's money in the malebox
Niggas hating, cause I'm up next
Fuck that, cause I'm up now
Any nigga that be talkin that shit, bet you that nigga gon be gunned down
4 cooks in the woods, lil nigga, got yo bitch and she good
On the block day and night, lil bro, and you ain't even be in the hood
I run up a bag, and I chace me a cheque
Got me a tast, so you know I'm gon flex
Yeah, I'm flexin, I'm flexin the best
Young rich nigga, you know that I'm blessed

[Hook: Zoey Dollaz]
Know I keep my circle small, couple niggas, couple brauds
Middle fingers to the law, middle fingers to the law
Pour up some drank, yeah, pour up some drank
Fuck all the fake, fuck all the fake
You know we gon ball together, hit the club and fuck it up together
You my nigga, you my dog forever
If you got beef, I'm involved, my nigga
