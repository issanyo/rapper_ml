[Intro]
Are you ready for this?
I don't know, are you?
Not at all (laughs)
Aye, aye gang gang
Aye, aye aye gang gang
Aye, aye aye gang gang
Aye, aye aye gang gang
Aye, aye aye gang gang
Aye, aye aye gang gang

[Chorus]
Glizzy hella geekin' got the blower on them
Shootin' shit we rockin with extensions
Fuck a stock we got extended clips
Lil baby I'm the man I bounce out in a stolen whip
Lil baby hit my line she sayin' come and pick her up at 6
(What) I don't do it 'cause a nigga don't got time for that
I'm fuckin' hella bitches but I still gotta get a bag
40 clip I got a mac and I'll push you back
And please don't try to run up 'cause I'll lay you on your fuckin' ass

[Verse]
Say these bitches fuckin' with me now
They fuckin' with me cause a nigga getting hella clout
But I don't phase them baby girl you gotta move around
You always ask for money when a young nigga come around
I carry big sticks, yeah that's that big bitch
That choppa kick shit, run up get hit bitch
Stomp a nigga out talkin' imma knock them down
And if he talkin' gunplay he catch a hunnid rounds
Imma smooth nigga
But I still bounce out with that tool nigga
On the block give a fuck about school nigga
I'm the man lil bitch I thought you knew nigga
I'm just tryna get this paper tryna run my money up
And live good like yo neighbors
Aye lil bro you need a taper
Turnt tables flip that bitch
And now a nigga goin major

[Chorus]
Glizzy hella geekin' got the blower on them
Shootin' shit we rockin with extensions
Fuck a stock we got extended clips
Lil baby I'm the man I bounce out in a stolen whip
Lil baby hit my line she sayin' come and pick her up at 6
(What) I don't do it 'cause a nigga don't got time for that
I'm fuckin' hella bitches but I still gotta get a bag
40 clip I got a mac and I'll push you back
And please don't try to run up cause I'll lay you on your fuckin' ass
