[Intro: DaniLeigh]
You too broke for me, nigga, hahahahaha
Playback, yeah, yeah, ooh
Bongo by the way

[Verse 1: DaniLeigh]
Have the blunt rolled for me when I get out the booth
Last summer, was friends, was cool, now I ain't playin' with you
Started lurking, asking questions, I ain't got no time to waste
Sweating me like that ass been on ex all day
Wax off, Daniel-san, dang lil' baby made her way
Now my paper long, get new cousins every day
Long as my mama straight, I'ma be grateful every day
Praise my Lord above, watching them blessings fall on me

[Chorus: DaniLeigh]
Just too broke for me
What you want from me?
Kevin Hart, little nigga, you a joke to me, yeah
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate
Keep your broke from me, you way too close to me
You gotta hit a blunt to, hit a blunt to talk to me (Yeah yeah yeah)
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
You can't hang with me, baby, you ain't gettin' no money
I might finesse her out some butt, but she gon' leave in the morning
I had to boss up on the bitch because my old chick was boring
I can't be pulling out no Mazda, I get jiggy in foreigns
I'm a dog, hellhound, and you know I don't play
I got some girls out of Houston, from LA to the Bay
I can't hold no conversation if I'm not gettin' paid
Why this girl say she gon' leave, but whole time she gon' stay?

[Chorus: DaniLeigh]
Just too broke for me
What you want from me?
Kevin Hart, little nigga, you a joke to me, yeah
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate
Keep your broke from me, you way too close to me
You gotta hit a blunt to, hit a blunt to talk to me (Yeah yeah yeah)
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate

[Verse 3: YG]
Uh, I don't fuck with you niggas, you ain't drippin' enough
I had to kick them hoes out, they wasn't wit' it enough
In the streets I got smoke, my windows tinted as fuck
And I ain't goin' to get no backwoods, this YG blunt
Fuck out my face, in my heart, I got hate
Fuck out my face, or I'm fighting the case
Fuck out my face, that chick ain't late
Fuck out my face, you can't be late
Fuck out my face, I'm fucking your bitch
She fucking my face, I love that shit
Fuck out my face, I'm too rich
Fuck out my face, I'm a gangbanger, bitch
I need a bitch like Marilyn Monroe
I tell her fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
Fuck it up, fuck it up, ho
I give her my Amex and let shop out on her own
And let her run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, make her say "Whoa"

[Chorus: DaniLeigh]
Just too broke for me
What you want from me?
Kevin Hart, little nigga, you a joke to me, yeah
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate
Keep your broke from me, you way too close to me
You gotta hit a blunt to, hit a blunt to talk to me (Yeah yeah yeah)
Fuck out my face, you can't relate
Fuck out my face, ain't no way you can relate
