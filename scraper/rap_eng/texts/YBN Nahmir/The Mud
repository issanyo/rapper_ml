[Chorus]
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug
Watch how a nigga get out the mud
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug

[Verse]
Baby choppers big choppers in the back tent
My niggas quick, they goin' put your ass up in that casket
We be really about that life
You just acting, saying you won't smuggle
We goin' catch you up in traffic
Yeah we lying broad day with a big case
Stretch your whole lot cause we don't play games
Banana clips
I don't really need no fucking A I there
He go slidin' back and let the choppers sing
Real life, 12 side catch a homicide
Hey yo ass caught that flee when the bullets fly
Kick you ass like that Madarallie see you finna cry
You said your hands worked well I guess that was a fucking lie
Nigga talk they shit, I'ma let that taco blow
Lil bro he in the court with the 44
Roll up we'll smoke like it fucking dope
Like a snowman we will be will niggas?
And I posted on the block with that cute thing
Niggas real thorough we don't switch lanes
Wobbly niggas coming up of the big stain
Baby grill drop your man he on big lane
Whole foe in my court he ain't got me leaning
Pooping Xans bitch he ain't got me beefing
I got it on me in case a nigga wanna starter sneaking
Up this bitch and blow these bitches and leave a nigga leaning
When you see us boy, you better fucking bail
Cause all we do is take dub
Bullets rigged through your head, like some fucking nails
Dancing with the devil, I'll send to ass to hell
40 block in this bitch ion catch a hun
They can't ever catch me cause they never found a body
Who's in charge now, I'm back like free Ronnie
Niggas say he looking for me he knowsâ€‹ where to find me

[Chorus]
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug
Watch how a nigga get out the mud
I'm trying to be rich by dub
I'm just stackin' up my paper
I ain't showing bitches love
I ain't begging for it either
Imma get out the mud
Nigga get up in my way
You goin' have catch a slug
