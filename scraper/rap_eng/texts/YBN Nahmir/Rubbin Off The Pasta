[Verse: YBN Nahmir]
They Say Lil' Nahmir where you been at? I'm Just Passin' A Pasta
I been runnin' up a check, that's why these bitches on pasta
I been coolin', layin' low but I'm not takin' a pasta
But just know a nigga back and this time I won't leave
I been runnin' runnin' runnin' gotta check me a pasta
I got hunnids on my neck and I got Trues on my pasta
Niggas said I'm goin' broke well I just take pasta
I be speedin' in that foriegn with Five-O on my pasta
But I'm that nigga I will never change rubbin' off the pasta
Smokin' dank got a pasta in my lap I, let it bang
Free Lil' Tay know he keep a pasta but he not Tay-K
Up the chop and let it blow watch this bitch heat pasta
I'm that nigga
And all my young niggas pullin' triggers
We pastas
We let this bitch off until you feel us
For you niggas
That's always on IG with them pasta
Takin' pictures
Is you really gon' use 'em or you just loafin' for them pasta
You niggas really hoes and you be acting like these pasta
You niggas say y'all silent but y'all probably in pasta
Most the niggas that's around me throwin' pasta like they crippin'
But they do it for the twins free Lil' Corey and Lil' Pasta
But I'm rockin' with my pastas and that's mandatory
One up top like I'm Mozzy bitch I keep a pasta
You say I'm lakin', nigga try me shoot you and your shorty
I'm cookin pasta in the lab like I'm Rick and Morty
Forty poppa, hit mobsta, turn your brain to pasta
Hit a pasta, dreads swangin' just like I'm a pasta
Smokin' pasta and I'm zooted, walkin' in my pasta
Any nigga touch my pasta, nigga i'ma pasta
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck pastas
It's one up top up in that chamber better duck pasta
Niggas dissin' on Lil' Valley he get slumped pasta
We shoot his body then we lay him in that pasta nigga
I'm one hundo bitch that's on my pasta i will never fold
A nigga speakin' on Lil' Pasta then that nigga gotta go
I'm really small but I can fight but I'ma still up that pasta
You niggas think I'm pussy you gon' have to show me pasta
Police always in my fuckin' pasta, I don't tell 'em shit
I'm really rappin' 'bout this fuckin' pasta that I fuckin' live
But I be coolin', tryna focus on them fuckin' pasta
But if it's pasta on your head well I'ma fucking get it man
