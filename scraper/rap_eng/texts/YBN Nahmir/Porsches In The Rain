[Intro: YBN Nahmir & YBN Almighty Jay]
Ayy bruh, GPS say 5 minutes away
It's cool, it's good, pull up
Alright, bet

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (gang)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Grrapapapow nigga! Ayy!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (and I be stayin' in my lane)
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (we ridin' porches in the rain)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Ayy! And I got ice up on my chain nigga!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (I be stayin' in my lane nigga! Gang!)

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
I talk to bro before I sleep at night (before I sleep at night)
Before I sleep at night, he always told me grab the pipe (Grrrraa!)
I heard it's money on my head, can't let them take my life (let the take my life, Ayy!)
I keep a Glock up in the Porsche 'cause I ain't living right ('cause I ain't living right, ayy! Bitch!)
It's two 40's on my hip and please don't make me flash (don't make me flash)
I trade the Audi for the Porsche 'cause it be goin' fast (Ayy! Ayy! 'Cause it be goin' fast)
It's YBN, bitch you know we all about the cash (Squad! Ayy! All about the cash)
If rappin' stop then you know we bringin' out the mask (bringin' out the mask)
It's 2 AM, with the poles, me and gang slide (gang slide!)
Me and gang extortin' niggas, watch them niggas cry (watch 'em cry)
I don't really play with niggas, play with me you die (die)
Niggas sayin' that it's funk but they apologize (apologize)
Steel plate, 50's and them K's, I let it spray (Ayy!)
Think I'm playin', pumpin' in the club, they gon' spray the mace (spray the mace)
Free Lil' Grim, we was on the block 'fore he caught a case (Ayy! Ayy! he caught a case)
A nigga copped a Benz but I'm bringin' out the Porsche today (Ayy! Ayy! I'm bringin' out the Porsche today!)

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (gang)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Grrapapapow nigga! Ayy!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (and I be stayin' in my lane)
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (we ridin' porches in the rain)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Ayy! And I got ice up on my chain nigga!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (I be stayin' in my lane nigga! Gang!)

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Ooh
Drop-top, two bitches in the studio gon' give top (bitch!)
New watch bust down, the AP, not the G-Shock, ooh
Bitch, I'm a pimp like Pinky, yuh
Wrist on water Fiji
Ooh, that bitch actin' bougie (bougie)
But she still wear Bebe
Ooh, pull up and shop (shop)
Robbed the plug, spend a bag on a watch (watch)
That bitch a thot (bitch!)
She started choosin', walkin' round with the knots (walkin' round with a Glock)
Yeah, Gucci sandals (sandals)
I fucked your bitch in flip-flops (flip-flops)
My bitches bad, your bitch not
Kicked the bitch out, told her "Kick rocks!" (stupid bitch!)

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (gang)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Grrapapapow nigga! Ayy!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (and I be stayin' in my lane)
We ridin' Porsches in the rain (we ridin' porches in the rain)
That lemon in my cup and I got ice up on my chain (Ayy! And I got ice up on my chain nigga!)
They started skatin' on me since a youngin' got the fame
But I be stackin' paper, I be stayin' in my lane (I be stayin' in my lane nigga! Gang!)
