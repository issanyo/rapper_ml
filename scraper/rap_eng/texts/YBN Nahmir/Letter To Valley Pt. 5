[Intro]
Ayy
Mr. Bounce out with that .44 nigga
Ayy, gang

[Verse 1]
Real thorough nigga, I ain't never switched up
Couple niggas say I changed 'cause the big bucks
I ain't never change, I just see you leachin' on me
Got mad, now my niggas started speakin' on me
Ayy, it's a shame how they changed, nigga
Rockin' baby, so I'm stayin' in my lane withcha
Niggas turned they back on me but you stayed with me
Only rocking with a few like my nigga Glizzy
Nigga speaking on my name when I'm not around
When I'm around, they thinkin' 'bout how they gon' knock me down
But it's cool, I'm thinkin' 'bout how I'm gon' get dough
By any means and that's if I gotta kick door
You dependin' on me, well you a man too
Get off your ass and go and show me what that Glock do
Ayy, man this shit be so crazy
I ain't even no Blood, but my mind goin' brazy
Ayy, damn, this shit fucked up
My own man shot at me and missed, so he lucked up
That shit hurts, cause that nigga was my ten hut
Over a bitch, little nigga why you switched up?
Ayy, it's so crazy how these niggas is
Like I'm 50, I be watchin' out for many men
It's niggas tryna kill me just 'cause they done seen me up
Hatin' from my own city, keep that shit a buck
Say, on my life I'ma try to put this city on
But if I don't put it on, Clink got the throne
Niggas snakes in the grass, so my grass cut
And if my time come, bitch, I was really up
End of the day, I just do it for my nigga Valley
Why the fuck they had to put my nigga in that Caddy?
Ayy, broken hearts leave a nigga sad
When you died I wasn't sad, it just made me mad
Bro, we had so much shit planned out
Skippin' states, we was thinkin' 'bout them band routes
Niggas speakin' on yo name, tryna get some fame
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas, I got perfect aim
Labels steady hittin' up about some signin' shit
It's YBN, big brother, I ain't signin' shit
You always told me stay up and don't settle for less
I only listened to you 'cause you told me the best
Bro, that shit is so fucked up, why you had to die?
I cried a lot, now a nigga can't even cry
Ayy, no, a nigga can't even cry
I know you here but your spirit somewhere in the sky
Bro, that shit is so fucked up, why you had to die?
I cried a lot, now a nigga can't even cry
Ayy, now a nigga can't even cry
I know you here but your spirit somewhere in the sky

[Outro]
Man, R.I.P. my nigga Valley, man
Niggas already know how the fuck I'm coming behind my niggas
Nigga, R.I.P. Tutu, nigga, you know I'm fucking with Vallejo hard nigga
Shout out my nigga NickyBaandz, SOBxRBE, I'm fucking with the bay for real nigga
Nigga, stop playing with my nigga name before I get up with you nigga, that's on my mama nigga
And, Birmingham with it, duck your mother fucking taco, bitch
