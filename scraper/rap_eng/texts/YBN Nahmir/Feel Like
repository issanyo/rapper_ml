[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe, I done made it
Couple niggas turned they back, I'm just glad they faded
Me and Glizzy ran it up, bitch we finally made it
Platinum without a label, nigga, I'm the greatest
Fuck these niggas hatin', I don't give a fuck
Now all these bands give me paper cuts
Hundred bands, gotta run ya bag up
Any means, gotta get the sack up
Niggas bummin' while they need to chase bands
How you hate, then you wanna shake hands?
Straight funks, leave you in a big jam
They slide down in a black van

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Hit a block, you still on that
You really with static, we tote automatics
That Glock got kickback
I need my protection, I keep me a weapon
It's hot, you know that
Apply all the pressure, that keep me on level
You niggas want static should know that I'm clever
I'm smooth like a feather, I'm killin' me never

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
Bitch, I'm spinnin' the block
Still here, I bounce out with the mob
Money talk, let's go straight to the top
Niggas mad but they [?] is not, I'm speakin' the facts
You playin' them games while I'm chasin' the sack
Try to take mines, you get left on your ass
You talk money, but you don't got no bag
I'm gettin' the cash, so you know I'ma brag
Go to Wendy's, get a 4 for $4
I'm the same nigga, still number four
Still bouncin' out with them .44s
Still the same nigga at your front door (come play lil nigga)
Play heat and get wet
Got that Glock tray and that TEC
If he talk, it hittin' his neck, then I skrrt off in that 'Vette

[Pre-Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Hit a block, you still on that
You really with static, we tote automatics
That Glock got kickback
I need my protection, I keep me a weapon
It's hot, you know that
Apply all the pressure, that keep me on level
You niggas want static should know that I'm clever
I'm smooth like a feather, I'm killin' me never

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
2-4, bitch I feel like Kobe
