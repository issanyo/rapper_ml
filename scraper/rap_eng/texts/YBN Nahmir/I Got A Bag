[Chorus]
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye

[Verse 1]
I got a bag I love to flex
Counting up them bands
Hit my line up for that package
You know my shit the best
She like she just want a passport
So I'm like what you hit my line for

[Chorus]
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye

[Verse 2]
Pour sprite in my cup then I pour some juice up in it
And the police on my ass just because my windows tinted
If a nigga want that static my nigga Glizzy let you have it
Ain't shit change bitch I'm still on that block
And I'm pulled up
A nigga run up on me, he getting fucked up
Those .223s hit yo whip then you out of luck
Nigga want that static choppas gone light they block up
Bitch I'm about a bag now
I be doing shows out of town
Man these niggas wanna be like me
Cause I be fishing in my money deep
I be flexing about a bag
You my son, I make you call me dad
I'm a grind until I get a Jag
No, I'm a grind until I get a pad

[Chorus]
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye
I got a bag I love to flex aye
I am the man, I run through checks aye
And I be cruising in a Lex aye
You know I'm better than the rest aye
