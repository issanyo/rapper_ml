Lyrics from a snippet

[YBN Nahmir]
Where you at
I'm in the trap, too much bands on me
Young nigga don't know how to act
Get them racks, can't go work for none
Man most of these niggas be cappers
Yeah that's all facts
Most of these be fake and most these niggas be rats
Know they fo for the low they comin in where you at

[Comethazine]
