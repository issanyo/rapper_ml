To the neck so you know we hit him

Lately, a nigga calmed down a lot
Free lil grim i remember postin on the block

Dont sip lean but a nigga sip lemonade
Dont need a gun ill box cause a nigga fade

Beat a nigga ass really take a nigga chain
Bounce out lil foe with the chop cause i keep that aim

50 in his chop Glock thats a rumor nigga
When i play well i playa with that [?] nigga

Claiming you a shooter nigga where yo body at .223’s
Penetrate and knock a nigga body back

Fix the scope like a lil kid ball cap
Woah these bitch slide up with all that

Like Nicky said ‘fore rap we was [?]
Takin niggas out up in school just for talkin shit

I’m a p what the fuck do you mean bitch
Empty out yo pockets fuck wit me thats a fee bitch

Yeah I be famous but a nigga still keep sticks
Nigga touch my chain at a show he gon get killed

Thats on my life ain't no nigga ever hol me
All that instagram flexing fuck typing nigga show me

I had it on me when they caught me by my lonely
Shot first, not later, so them niggas couldn’t smoke me

I had it on me when they caught me by my lonely
Shot first, not later, so them niggas couldn’t smoke me

These niggas mad cause I’m getting all this money
And I’m flying all these jets n a nigga stay O.T

But ill still shoot a nigga at a mer—
