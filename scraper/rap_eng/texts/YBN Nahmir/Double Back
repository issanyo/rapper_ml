[Intro: YBN Nahmir]
Huh?
Brrrrat-bow-bow-bow
Huh?
Ayy, bitch

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spin the block, hit the block, then I double back
Niggas usin' pocket rockets, but we over that
That chopper kick is knockin' off your fitted cap
We carry pipes, fuck typin', we ain't into that
Real niggas on that nigga, where that nigga at?
Put some strips on that nigga, bring that nigga back
Pass the blower to my brother, get a nigga clapped
Chopper bullets hit your body like they Warren Sapp

[Verse 1: Asian Doll]
Chopper hit your body, make you do the Hammer dance
Add them numbers up, gon' weigh the dope like we the muffin man
I got ammunition for them bitches I'm not rockin' with
Say you want that smoke, I got that glow, I used to fuck with Xans
Came up passin' bitches like a gun, smokin' Cali though
Asian Doll the realist, bitch, we can't forget lil' Cuban though
Niggas wanna fuck us, but together we expensive, ho
Double stacks, countin' racks, reckless, pop up at your show

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spin the block, hit the block, then I double back
Niggas usin' pocket rockets, but we over that
That chopper kick is knockin' off your fitted cap
We carry pipes, fuck typin', we ain't into that
Real niggas on that nigga, where that nigga at?
Put some strips on that nigga, bring that nigga back
Pass the blower to my brother, get a nigga clapped
Chopper bullets hit your body like they Warren Sapp

[Verse 2: Cuban Doll]
Bitches never 'bout the action, don't get into that
And if that bitch was talkin' down, we gon' get her back
Ridin' with my Asian like we Haitian, we don't know how to act
Bitches see us, fall back, they just mad the Doll's back
Hundred bands on that boy, he a bitch now
YBN gang shit, kick that bitch out
Bitches must have thought it was a drought, but we rich now
Got my niggas ridin' with them .30s and them dicks out

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spin the block, hit the block, then I double back
Niggas usin' pocket rockets, but we over that
That chopper kick is knockin' off your fitted cap
We carry pipes, fuck typin', we ain't into that
Real niggas on that nigga, where that nigga at?
Put some strips on that nigga, bring that nigga back
Pass the blower to my brother, get a nigga clapped
Chopper bullets hit your body like they Warren Sapp

[Verse 3: YBN Nahmir]
Clap a nigga just for talkin' on that slick shit
Drive by a lil' nigga, get your whip flipped
I ain't duckin' no smoke when I'm in the mix
'Cause when the funk in my turf, I be shootin' shit
Bitches get to tweakin' and lil' Asian get to whackin' shit
Cuban got the .40, turn your nigga into cannabis
Body on the blower, bet my niggas finna vanish it
Nigga run up 30 shots and nah they can't handle it

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Spin the block, hit the block, then I double back
Niggas usin' pocket rockets, but we over that
That chopper kick is knockin' off your fitted cap
We carry pipes, fuck typin', we ain't into that
Real niggas on that nigga, where that nigga at?
Put some strips on that nigga, bring that nigga back
Pass the blower to my brother, get a nigga clapped
Chopper bullets hit your body like they Warren Sapp

[Outro: YBN Nahmir]
Spin the block, hit the block, then I double back
Niggas usin' pocket rockets, but we over that
That chopper kick is knockin' off your fitted cap
We carry pipes, fuck typin', we ain't into that
Real niggas on that nigga, where that nigga at?
Put some strips on that nigga, bring that nigga back
Pass the blower to my brother, get a nigga clapped
Chopper bullets hit your body like they Warren Sapp
