Stackin' up my paper gotta get rolls
No, I cannot be unless I gotta get dough
If a nigga going broke I hit a kick doe
Stacking all these fuckin' bands get me rich though
Stackin' up my paper gotta get rolls
No, I cannot be unless I gotta get dough
If a nigga going broke I hit a kick doe
Stacking all these fuckin' bands get me rich though

[Verse]
Pull up in a foreign
That's that newest shit
Rockin' on my jeans Glock up on my hip
Balenciaga's on my feet probably cost your rent
They say you only live once
So I take that risk
Takin' hella trips up outta town getting bands
You know that I'm that nigga now
Got my head up to the sky
My brother Pow yelling "Free DQ"
Big bro just hold it down (hold it down)
Mama told me "Yeah they foreign and that shit be boring"
So I'm chasing hella bags while you niggas snoring
V8 in my hemi got my engine roarin'
I'ma trade it get that Porsche 'cuz a nigga tourin'
I'm a boss and I'm young so I gotta flex
I'ma flex and finesse 'cuz I flex the best
But we aimin' for your taco you don't need no vest
I gotta keep a ? down 'cuz a nigga next
