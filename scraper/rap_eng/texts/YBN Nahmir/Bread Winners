Hoodzone Productions
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, gang, gang
Bitch, grrah, pow, pow, pow
Yeah, whatchu-whatchu, gang, gang
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, gang, gang
I ain't never breakin' bread with her
Gang shit

[Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
Take a bitch from the strip, to the bed
Make that hoe give me head, but I ain't never breakin' bread with her (I ain't never breakin' bread with her)
Niggas lame, they want beef with the gang
Tryna diss YBN 'cause they know we some bread winners ('cause they know we some bread winners)
Bread getter, double flip it, that's a bread dinner (gang, gang)
Head getter, she gon' suck it, she a head giver
One night with a bitch, and let my mans get her
No new niggas 'cause these niggas be some pretenders (gang)

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Yo' man a head giver, I'm a lead giver
I fucked yo' bitch, so I gotta let my mans hit her (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
30 clip in the stick if her mans with her (gang)
So yo' bitch let me fuck 'cause my chain bigger (huh?)
You say you get stacks, I'ma double that (I'ma double that)
I spin a nigga block, and then I double back (on my mama)
Them niggas know me like the house on the dead-end (on the dead-end)
Well that's the trap that, we used to make bread in (ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2: YBN Almighty Jay]
Like a nigga with a cane, I bring that stick out (grrah, bang)
Hit her hard from the back, It damn near blew my hip out (yeah, yeah)
Talkin' shit, the Glock a linebacker, how them bullets blitz out
Had 'em scared in the streets like he in the movie Get Out (bitch, gang)
Gang, broke ass niggas, get yo' funds up (get yo' funds up)
How yo' niggas shooters? Boy, they need to get they guns up (need to get they guns up)
Yeah, my main bitch a stripper, told that hoe to get her 1's up (bitch, get yo' 1's up)
Gang bangin' niggas up in church with them guns tucked (gang, grrah, bang)

[Verse 3: YBN Nahmir]
Bounce out with them titties, damn near knock a nigga block down (grrah)
Chicken, chicken, chicken, yeah, a nigga gettin' guap now (pow, pow, pow, pow)
You need to get yo' bitch 'fore that bitch get piped down (bitch)
Christian LB's, only shoes that I rock now (on my mama, ayy, ayy)
You tryna fuck a bitch that I been fucked (I been fucked, nigga)
The whole team hit, she done got ducked
Don't chase a bitch, only thing that I chase is paper (gang)
This money in my jeans, got me ballin' like the Lakers

[Verse 4: YBN Almighty Jay]
My chain shine brighter than a light strip (lane, lane)
Gave a hundred to the waiter, nigga, that's a light tip, ballin' (ballin')
That's why my old bitch is stalkin' (you stupid bitch)
YBN the Dream Team, money balls like Spaldin' (gang, gang)
I just wanna fuck, don't wanna cuff you, bitch, I'm sorry
Scratched her name off the list, and the bitch won't stop callin'
Poked a hole in my condom, bitch try to put me on Maury (hell nah)
I ain't dumb, bitch, drop the top on the 'Rari (skrrt, skrrt, gang, gang)

[Chorus: YBN Almighty Jay]
Take a bitch from the strip, to the bed
Make that hoe give me head, but I ain't never breakin' bread with her (I ain't never breakin' bread with her)
Niggas lame, they want beef with the gang
Tryna diss YBN 'cause they know we some bread winners ('cause they know we some bread winners)
Bread getter, double flip it, that's a bread dinner (gang, gang)
Head getter, she gon' suck it, she a head giver
One night with a bitch, and let my mans get her
No new niggas 'cause these niggas be some pretenders (gang)
