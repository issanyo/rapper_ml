[Verse]
Cash life, tell me you is really 'bout that cash life
Slide down to your block, slow down hit the lights
Nigga really talking beef, all my niggas we don't fight
So if you really want that beef, boy you better have a pipe
I'm just trying to get this chicken, niggas really want static
I'm the type of nigga who gon' throw you in that casket
Niggas saying they got crooked dough, we ain't matchin'
And if you are try to move, then my niggas let you have it
Bitch, lil' nigga that's that Doggpound
You now we got hella choppas with a hunnid rounds
Ay, it ain't shit to put a nigga down
Nigga trying to run, there's gon' be another man down
Had your mans [?] from a K-round
Make a nigga ears busts from that K-sound
Trap phones steady jumpin' in my way now
I heard the cops comin', so we gotta get away now
