[Hook]
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, then my bro do him dirty
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, hen my bro do him dirty

[Verse 1]
Say lil bro got the choppa, AKA YapaScopa
I see the money I'm chasin', I gotta get to the gwalla
Say your bitch she be callin', I swear that lil bitch she stalkin'
I don't got time for the talkin', if it's not money involved
Bitch I don't want relations, I'm tryna run up a check
I don't fuck with these bitches, they gon be good for the neck
Bitch I'm built up and ballin', you need to call you a ref
Because I'm flexin on niggas, because I know I'm up next

[Hook]
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, then my bro do him dirty
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, hen my bro do him dirty

[Verse 2]
Bitch just calling my line, instead I'm pressing decline
If you not talking chicken, then why you bangin my line
I am not wit no minutes, but you still wasting my time
And I'm not worried bout nobody, I'm just tryna get mines
Bitch I'm cutthroat and lawless, and yeah you know my bitch flawless
We catch an op in the field, it ain't no talkin' we sparkin'
My lil money is stackin', and you could see if he ballin'
And niggas fraudin' and talkin', until [?] often
I'm taggin' that bag gotta get to the cash
No competition you niggas in last
I used to be broke so you know imma brag
Got a Glock in the rari you know imma blast
Put a lil nigga right up in the bag
Try me then I'm squeezing the mags
Skrrt off in the muhfuckin jag
That's why you lil niggas mad

[Hook]
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, then my bro do him dirty
I smoke me a backwood, I pour a 4 of that lean
If you think that I'm lackin', I'm in your cut with a beam
Nigga try to run on me, I send a shot like I'm curry
And if a nigga want that static, hen my bro do him dirty
