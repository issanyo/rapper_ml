[Verse]
Applying on this pressure to you fuck niggas (fuck niggas)
When I blow this four-five you better duck nigga (duck nigga)
I ain't ready with that talking I'm gon knockdown
When I pop yo ass, I'm skippin' till you out of town (out of town)
I'm that nigga that your bitch loves to talk about
Every time I turn, my name up in your fucking mouth (bitch)
Ever since I touched a bow, I let that roll out
With nigga steady plotting, so I'm clutching on that choke pound
Since I'm light skinned, they think that I'm a fucking clown
Well let a nigga try me, I'ma blow him down
And my niggas smoke dope by the fucking pound
Put a brick on top of your head, my niggas gonna lace it down
Bitch, you broke, you still catching gray hounds
I be puffing, and yes, with the grey clouds
Niggas see 38's, cuz it's ok 'round
That old lady on the porch better not make a fucking sound
Boy, it's not an arcade, I don't play games
My side piece, probably your hoe, main
I was taught how to gun, how to maintain
Nigga, in it for that moment, ya that low fame
I'ma get it, I'ma show you niggas that I'm with it
I ain't high and I'ma blow some hollows at your fifty
Keep this money stacked back, and get another benny
AP girl, bucket back to London get my fucking hit, bitch nigga
We the reason why there's all these fucking bodies (bodies)
Niggas shooting in the area and never caught a body
Nigga, they jocking on my style, they wanna fucking copy
Whole time, they baby momma want to come and fucking top me
Niggas rapping about that shit that they don't do
These boys Super Saiyan like they Goku
Boy, you ain't my bro, I don't even know you
I treat you niggas like that little nigga, Scooby Doo
