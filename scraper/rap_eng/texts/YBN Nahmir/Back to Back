[Chorus: Almighty Savage]
I'm posted up with them niggas (yeah)
Niggas, they know how we bummin' (what's up)
I'm posted up with them killers (what up)
I'm givin' guns to my youngins (grrah)
My niggas don't [?], they wildin' (yeah)
We totin' things and they gunnin' (huh)
Lately I've been fuckin' models (nah)
They wanna fuck 'cause I'm stuntin' (huh)
I can't put a ring a bitch (no)
Just wanna fuck when I'm runnin' (bitch)
She wanna fuck me real good (yeah)
But she steady askin' for somethin' (uh-huh)
I'm back to back with these hits (back to back)
I do this shit like it's nothin' (whoa)

'Cause I got straight fire coming (yeah)

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Yeah, I got a beam on a Glock (whoa)
Got yo' bitch and she givin' me top (gang)

Fuck with me and lil nigga get shot (wet)
