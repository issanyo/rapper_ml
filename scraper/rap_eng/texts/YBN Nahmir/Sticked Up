[Intro: YBN Almighty Jay]
Every time that you see me, bitch I'm sticked up
Always got that stick tucked
Pussy nigga give it up
Ain't worry about no bih'
'Cause that pussy, she gon' give it up
Don't got to give her shit 'cause off rip
She gon' let me fuck

[Verse 1: YBN Almighty Jay]
Swervin' in that new body
Drop top that new 'gatti
Feelin' like I'm John Gotti
'Cause I don't fear nobody
I just got a new shawty
And I got her a new body
Burn off in that foreign, guess she hot, just like wasabi
Kicking off that flavor, kicking shit just like karate
I don't need no handouts little boy, bitch my crew got me
Plug just called my phone with the drugs 10-4 copy
Diamonds skated on my wrist like a nigga playin' hockey
Cashed out in the mall, everyday is my payday
What's that little gun? Oh, that's my mini AK, that Draco
Shoot a nigga in the face make 'em lay low
That chopper hold a hunnid K tho
Pull up on a nigga, let that gun go
Vraa-bang-bang like Tadoe

[Bridge: YBN Almighty Jay]
Who don't want no beef? Who don't want no smoke?
My nigga super savage, they'll kick a door
I flip that work, like I flip your ho
If she don't do the team, then she gotta go

[Verse 2: YBN Nahmir]
I got fame on my name, watch me do my thang
But let a nigga act tough, I'm blowing out his brain
Don't make me pull up on your block, and snatch your fucking chain
'Cause I show up to your shit and treat you like a fucking lame
Bitch, you'se a motherfucking cornball
All ya Twitter beefin' niggas, we ignore ya'll
Ya'll some little ass boys, man ya'll so small
I know your background, lil' bitch I'll expose ya'll
Draco bullets hit your whip
If you're talking all that shit, my nigga Jay up in the cut
Clutchin' on that .45
Slide down to a nigga block, hit 'em with a fucking Glock
Bullets hit his fucking top, somebody grab a fucking mop
Deebo when a nigga shit, then I finna fuck his bitch
Jay calling my phone saying: "Bro, let's go hit a lick"
I'mma go and grab a stick
Cock it then we finna dip
Kicking down the door
And aim a toolie at your daddy's lip
Get into his fucking cash
Yes I gotta check a bag
I'm in first while you in last
I'm leaning, but I never crack
Put you in a body bag
Now I know your momma sad
'Cause I had done fuck you up
And I'm the reason why you had to pass

[Verse 3: YBN Nahmir]
Niggas know, I'm not the one to be fucked with
AR-15 shots make a nigga duck quick (pa-pa-pa-pa)
All that Facebook talk and this gon' get you done quick (nigga)
I'm turning to a demon, when you put me in a fucking (in that what)
A nigga talking bodies, well let's talk bodies (let's talk bodies)
You gon' end up your like your mans, if you go on and try me (you go and try me)
Nigga steady looking for me, you know where to find me (you know where to find me, nigga)
Bitch I'm in the ham with a pole, nigga I ain't hiding (I ain't hiding)
Everywhere I go I got to keep a stick on me (a stick on me)
So if a nigga try me, light him like a Christmas tree (a Christmas tree)
My name popping, they be buzzin' like some fucking bees (skrr, skrr)
So I'mma slide down and bless your bitch like that bitch sneezed
