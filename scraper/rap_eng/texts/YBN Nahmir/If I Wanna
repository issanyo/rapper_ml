[Intro]
Gang gang gang
Skrrr
Glock
Gang

[Chorus - YBN Nahmir]
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said we finn race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said say we finna race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith

[Verse 1 - YBN Nahmir]
I'm stackin' chips, I'm stackin' whips
I'm stackin' bricks
Say my broski get up on him, then he better dip
And if I catch a nigga lackin, while he wit' his bitch
Ay, bullets hit his head. He caught one in the lip
Ay, bitches know my name, these bitches on my dick
Try to run up on me, bitch, I'll smoke em like a zip
Smoke em like some ziggy ziggy all up in my zip
Run into the bag, bitch I gotta take a breath
Don't make me call my nigga up and tell him load the mag
Boy have you ever seen what chopper bullets do to vests?
And we ain't aiming for yo leg, we hit you in yo chest
If we don't hit you in yo chest, we hit you in yo neck
Free my big brother DQ, and free my brother (?)
Can't wait til they let my niggas out them gates
Prolly smoking backwoods with my brother Tay
And don't forget about Lil Glizzy cause he got a K


[Chorus - YBN Nahmir]
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said say we finn race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said say we finna race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith

[Verse 2 - Key Glock]
I'll pull up in a Benz, leave in a McLaren
I got all these bitches staring, touch my chain, I dare ya
I just took my rollie off, then copped me a Patek
You ain't smoking on this (?), boy this shit embarrassing
It's Nahmir and Glock, nightmare on yo block
And we keep them chops, like a butcher shop
We the gang you not, and we got them knots
Hit him wit a dart, and skate off just like Bart
I don't really dance, but I got a milly rock
The chopper make you dance, knock a nigga out his socks
I don't really dance, but I got a milly rock
The chopper make you dance, knock a nigga out his socks


[Chorus - YBN Nahmir]
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said say we finn race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith
Say if I wanna Imma buy it
Imma spend my K
And we not really with that talkin'
Choppas hit his face
Say fuck'em, do the dash
First he said say we finna race
Hey, pull up in that beamer
Leave off in that wraith
