[Chorus]
Fresh off the block, call my doctor get a check up yeah
Private plane, helicopter when I flex up yeah (When I flex up yeah)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (In a Tesla)
200 racks in the dresser (Ayy)
50 when I press up
Flood the AP and the rolex in rotation
Post em up, on the gram, for motivation (Motivation)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (Tesla)
200 racks in the dresser (Ayy)
50 when I press up

[Verse 1]

Yeah, bitch its YBN, nice to meet ya
I brought the whole fucking gang on a date
Sorry for the wait ayy

[Verse 2]
I just put some [?] on a wraith when I race
These niggas reaching, yeah they talking, bitches creeping
Way too often, I be seeing these bitches frequent
Creeping, calling, [?]

Wavy young nigga leave em' sea sick

[Chorus]
Fresh off the block, call my doctor get a check up yeah
Private plane, helicopter when I flex up yeah (When I flex up yeah)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (In a Tesla)
200 racks in the dresser (Ayy)
50 when I press up
Flood the AP and the rolex in rotation
Post em up, on the gram, for motivation (Motivation)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (Tesla)

[Verse 3]
You can catch the back of my fucking hand if you mess up
Me, and my dogs, [?] doing, playing catch up
Poked a thottie, nasty thinking we need a check up
Kidding, I can’t touch it if it ain't ten or better
Where your papers hoe?
No lactose intolerant
I need my cheddar bitch all of it
All these lame hoes tryna ride my dick
Before I cum jump off of it
Been a boss since day one
Want beef? i gotta Glock, and a A1
I press up now, I can't run
Man tell em' where we came from

[Chorus]
Fresh off the block, call my doctor get a check up yeah
Private plane, helicopter when I flex up yeah (When I flex up yeah)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (In a Tesla)
200 racks in the dresser (Ayy)
50 when I press up
Flood the AP and the rolex in rotation
Post em up, on the gram, for motivation (Motivation)
Might do the whole fucking dash in a Tesla (Tesla)
200 racks in the dresser (Ayy)
50 when I press up
