[Intro]
Bravestar, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse 1]
I'm a young nigga, countin' up stacks
Spend a check, I'm guranteed to get it back
I'm smokin' pack, yeah that's how your boy relax
No free songs, yeah you know I'm finna tax
Ayy, ayy, watch how a nigga dab
I'm in a uber, I ain't ridin' in no cab
I'm whippin' bricks in the mufuckin' lab
At Benihana's I be eatin' on em crabs
Yeah, yeah that's how a nigga flex
Diamonds cost 20k around my neck
Yeah, bitch you know I gotta flex
Can't wait to get paid so I could cop that new Lex
Yeah, and bitch I'm really boutta bag
I'm only 16, rollin' in a Jag
And I'm, I'm hosting parties at my pad
My mom out of town, so I know she mad
Young nigga flee like I hit the jackpot
Got 2mil up in my stashpot
Walkin' round the mall, new shirt, new watch
Bought some new jeans, and they all top notch
Look at how a nigga live, yeah I live great
Big house, Big cars, ain't shit fake
Ayy, and you know I'm gettin' mad cake
A nigga might fuck round' and ice skate
Balmains, with some new Balenciagas
Ice walk, when I'm walkin' in my fuckin' pradas
Young rich nigga, so you know I gotta keep a llama
Fuck that talkin', lil bitch we all about that drama
Skrrt Skrrt, ridin' round' in a black benz
I see everything clear, with my buff lens
Fuck yo bitch, and now I'm finna fuck her friend
Turn her over like a slinky, watch that ass bend
Ayy, and lil' nigga I'm the shit
Don't think because I'm small, I don't be clutchin' on no clip
Ayy, a young nigga wit a stick
If you keep talkin' crazy, put that 40 to ya lip
And don't be selfish give back, to the kid that ain't got nothin' and they momma on crack
Ayy, and I'm posted in a flax
I'mma be like my uncle, you could call me "Lil Jack"
Spend a stack, it ain't nun to a boss
Cash out at the mall, I don't care about the cost
Ayy, and all this money that I toss
I put that on the boss, lil' bitch I'mma floss
Aye, but a nigga back now
Up that choppa, make a goofy nigga fuckin' back down
Ayy, ayy, fuck a 30 we got 60 rounds
Half these niggas in my city know I don't play round
New foreign every week, had to cop a Panamera with the all red seats
Now I got these bitches all on my muthafuckin' meat
Where was yall when a nigga ain't have shit to eat?

[Outro]
But I don't fuckin' know, and I'mma let it go
All these bitches gon fuck you when you rich and leave you when you broke
But that's how the story goes, I'mma stick to myself
Bitch, and go OVO (OVO)
But now I know (OVO), I know these bitches go (OVO)
They gon' fuck a nigga when you fuckin' broke (WHEN YOU BROKE)
They ain't gon fuck a nigga when you fuckin' broke
But I'mma stay by myself, bitch, and go OVO
