Ay, Ay, Ay, Gang, Gang
Ay, Ay, Ay, Gang, Gang
Ay, Ay, Ay, Gang, Gang
Have you ever had a dream that...that you um...you..SHUT THE FUCK UP!

[Hook]
Have you ever had a dream that you was countin' up mills
But then you woke up hella broke so now you like what the hell?
Ima stack my money up and Ima chase my dreams
And if a nigga in my way, He gon meet that beam
I don't do a lot of talkin', play with me then I spark it
And if you try to take my chain we leave you dead in a coffin
And I'm just tryna stack my money and just chase my dreams
Any nigga in my way, he gon meet that beam

[Verse]
Any nigga in my way he gon meet that beam
This uzi pop and hit a nigga its gon make him sink
I be coolin' up in traffic riding with my team
And for y'all niggas that be dissin', y'all ain't on a thing
Nigga run up try to rob me, With this Glock Ima pop him
And if I don't got the blower on me, then Alonzo gon drop him
I keep this money in my pocket, But I keep pocket rockets
And all the bitches be up on me cause a nigga be flockin'
You know a nigga be flockin', And all these niggas be jockin'
They wanna copy my style so in my eye they be mockin'
Gotta watch the surroundings, You gotta always be caution
Cause niggas hate when you flexin', And now they ask when to off you
So Ima always be smooth, Ima always be cool
Watch how I run up a check, Watch how I do what I do
I'm the man in my town, And bitch I don't fuck around
You try to play with my money, Well bitch I'm knocking you down

[Hook]
Have you ever had a dream that you was countin' up mills
But then you woke up hella broke so now you like what the hell?
Ima stack my money up and Ima chase my dreams
And if a nigga in my way, He gon meet that beam
I don't do a lot of talkin', play with me then I spark it
And if you try to take my chain we leave you dead in a coffin
And I'm just tryna stack my money and just chase my dreams
Any nigga in my way, he gon meet that beam
