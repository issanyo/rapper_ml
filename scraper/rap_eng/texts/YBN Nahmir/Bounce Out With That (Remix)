[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
(Gang)
Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, ayy
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (huh, huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (bitch)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)

[Post-Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (hell nah)
Off tops, new chain and my wrist froze (on the gang)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (huh)
Fuck a bitch and then I put it in a bitch throat (bitch throat)
Never give a bitch yo' phone, that's a no-no (hell nah)
Off tops, new chain, and my wrist froze (huh)
Loaded up, still bouncin' with that .44 (huh)

[Verse 1: YBN Nahmir]
Stop it, niggas knowin' that I drop shit (I drop shit)
Get popped quick 'cause them niggas that you rock with (rock with)
Like Jay said, bitch I gotta keep a chopstick (grrah)
Big stick, I bounce out with that mop stick (grrah, pow, pow, pow)
These niggas talkin', watch I pull up in that fuckin' Hemi (skrrt)
Tote automatics so I pass my lil' bro the semi (on the gang)
I'ma rock this lil' bitch 'til that tank empty (huh)
I'ma still blow that bitch 'til the clip empty (ayy, gang)

[Bridge: YBN Nahmir]
Bitch I'm a P (what), bitch I'm a G (huh)
Took that lil' bitch now that bitch off the leash (ayy, ayy, ayy, gang)

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (pass her to the clique, nigga)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, huh
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (huh, huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (bitch)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Aye, YBN I need a piece of this shit hold up
Aye, Gunna, lately I'm fucking everybody's bitch
Take they lil' shit and then I throw it on my wrist
I'm a outlaw never played the politics
In the Grammy's with a gun until they put me on the list
I had, two popstars in the same pic
Now them two popstars on the same dick
Ruthless, who's bitch did I have at Ruth Chris
Eating up two dicks like Twix? (tell 'em who it is!)
It's the Young Gun, one ton (aye, whoo!)
Suitcase full of Ben Franks in the trunk
Double X (gang!)
Gang in the flesh (gang!)
Bounce out with the pistol with the Moncler vest (boom!)
Oh you mad 'cause I'm styling on you
We eatin' Penne, all Italian on you
Three albums on you (three of them!)
Man you not really with this shits
You don't wanna go to war with the twenty one-six
Bitch I'm a G
Bitch I'm a freak
My bitch bring two bitches, bitch that make three, I say

[Chorus: YBN Nahmir]
Lately been on that fuck a nigga shit (fuck a nigga shit)
Take a nigga bitch and then I pass her to the clique (pass her to the clique, nigga)
I say, see me, I don't got no time for no bitch (time for no bitch)
I just get 'em for the bros, I'm just worried 'bout them chips, I'm a, huh
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (huh, huh)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)
Shot call, lil' nigga, I'ma stay wild (bitch)
Hot nigga, I belong in a dog pound ('long in a dog pound)
