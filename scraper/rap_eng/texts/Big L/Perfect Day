[Intro/Hook: Jim Jones]
And I’ve been looking at the stars all night
It got me thinking how can I get away
It got me thinking about a perfect day
And I could tell you something we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And I’ve been thinking how can I get away
It got me thinking ’bout a perfect day
She got the babysitter watching the kids
She gettin’ sexy and they're here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinking ’bout a perfect day

[Bridge: Chink Santana + Jim Jones + Logic]
We could be anywhere in the World
But we right here
We gon’ be right here
For this perfect day
Got me thinking ’bout a perfect day

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
My perfect day
No work today
Got me thinking ’bout the breeze when the sun get hot
On a water on the surface surface play
Nah no turf today
Told my man throw his work away
I got a foolproof plan
Make a couple of mill'
And I think it’s gonna work today ay

[Hook: Jim Jones]
And I could tell you something we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And i’ve been thinking how can I get away
It got me thinking about a perfect day
She got the babysitter watching the kids
She gettin’ sexy and they're here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinking ’bout a perfect day

[Bridge: Chink Santana + Jim Jones + Uncredited Vocals]
We could be anywhere in the world
But we right here
We gon’ be right here
For this perfect day
Got me thinking ’bout a perfect day

[Verse 2: Chink Santana]
No gunshots no caskets
No sirens flashing
No V’s no police
No handcuffs no rips no lashes
We drunk no crashes
Twist it up no passes
No sticks no skins
No seeds we blowing the finest grasses

[Outro/Hook: Jim Jones]
And i’ve been running in the streets all day
And i’ve been looking at the stars all night
It got me thinking how can I get away
It got me thinking about a perfect day
And I could tell you something we both know
We can hustle but the streets get cold
And i’ve been thinking how can I get away
It got me thinking ’bout a perfect day
She got the babysitter watching the kids
She gettin’ sexy and they're here all day
She gonna party all her troubles away
She must be thinking ’bout a perfect day
