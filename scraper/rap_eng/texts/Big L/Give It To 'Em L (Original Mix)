[Big L]
I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze
Playin' rappers out like striped Lee's
I'm smoother than velvet
My rhymes are well writ
You're sayin' L's this and L's that, get off L dick
Battles I refuse to lose
I choose to cruise smooth, like the blues
I never hear boos cause I amuse
Grab the brew and take a sip
I stay lookin' dip, mics I rip
Don't flip, we on the party tip
But you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you, but not with a telephone
I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black, white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L

I damage all opponents as soon as the bell ring
It's all about me, yo it's a B-I-G-L thing
The crown is still mine, I drop ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder stuff and couldn't kill time
And rockin' a crowd, I got it pat down
While D-Wiz rip shop in the background
Rhymes I make'll knock out your gold tooth
Fightin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
My style gets scarier
Battles? The more the merrier
You can't compare me ta, brothers from the area
Or brothers from other states, because this brother makes
Outstandin' lyrics that suffocates
Brothers from New York to the Bahamas
Rappers talkin' 'bout breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
The Big L's quick to make a chick lift her skirt up
Step to this and get hurt up
Word up

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L

MCs get taught a lesson when the mic is in my po-ssession
Rap's my pro-fession...no question
It's a fact I stay geared
It shouldn't be weird, that I'm feared
Cause my raps are rougher than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm def like Jeff
Right to left, my raps are badder than mornin' breath
Basin' in my face, I won't accept that
You better step back, before your eye be jet black
And suckers I'm a stiggedy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I hit hard from New York to Miami
Pockets stay swolled up like a eye jammy
I'm dropping science on wax while you kickin' riddles
I'm a Big Mac, you and your whole crew are Chicken Littles
To be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own poems
Or get your dome flown
MCs want no parts o' L
As I rip shop with Hip-Hop, the crowd starts to yell

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L

It's Big L, y'all
I'm living swell y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells y'all

Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
Let 'em have it L, give it to 'em L
