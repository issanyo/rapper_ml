I'm comin through y'all, with the Glock buckin
Ya whole block duckin
Every bitch that I'm fuckin with now is cock suckin
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin
Ya niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson and Boy George
I destroy broads with one verse
Nigga we could knuckle up or we could let the guns burst
L is the type, to murder your son first, to get my point across
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the powers
Y'all might as well join The Force
Where I'm from believe me, snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin daily tryna fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin pitchers in silk, gayed it up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch but I ain't rape the slut she gave it up
I runnin with Wop, you runnin wit me, we runnin together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front, the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill, ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin to Corle' you better be real
Cuz none of my niggas be lettin me chill
My crew be deliverin hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killin up shit in rap events
It's like, soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin the people yell
I'm rugged as hell
Brothers can tell, that none of y'all niggas is fuckin with L
When I'm that nigga ya ex-pect, to catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
