[Kid Capri:]
So put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on represent put it on, C'MON!

[Big L:]
Nobody can take nuttin from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast the shottie
Got more cash than Gotti (you don't know?) you betta ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skinz
And get endz and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, youse a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows, wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin wreck to the break of dawn
And it's on, yo it's a must that I put it on

[Kid Capri:]
Yeah, so put it on Big L, put it on
C'mon put it on, big fella put it on and on
Put it on Big L, put it on represent
Put it on, c'mon put it on...
