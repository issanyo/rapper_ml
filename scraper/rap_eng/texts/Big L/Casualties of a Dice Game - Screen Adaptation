POV REARVIEW: The car is still trailing, getting closer

As soon as Lamont hits a straight stretch of road he accelerates to about 80 MPH

The trailing car also speeds up until it’s right on Lamont’s ass

Lamont grabs his gun, takes it off safety

Without warning Lamont slams on his brakes causing the trailing car to slam into the back of his car

EXT. STREET

The two cars skid out of control, Lamont’s Acura fishtails then flips over onto it’s roof, screeching to a stop

The trailing car slams into a brick wall at about 60 MPH

INT. LAMONTS CAR

As the smoke clears Lamont crawls out of his overturned car
Blood squirts profusely from a deep gash in Lamont’s right arm, so he grabs his gun with the left arm

EXT. STREET - CRASH SCENE

Lamont staggers over to the totaled car, the Thugs still stuck inside, one of them screaming in pain, the other silent

Lamont looks through the shattered glass window, the passenger is dead with his face smashed against the dashboard, the driver badly hurt, covered with glass, legs pinned under the crumbled steel, screaming for help

Lamont shakes his head then shoots the driver three times
POP POP POP

Lamont stumbles down an alley, bleeding badly from several deep gashes

EXT. INTERSECTION

Lamont sees a cab parked on the corner. He stumbles across the street and gets in the taxi

INT. CAB

Lamont in the back seat bleeding all over

CAB DRIVER
(Hindu Accent)
Get out of my cab motherfucker!
Look at you bleeding all over my back seat
Get your monkey ass out of my fucking cab!

Lamont hands the Cabdriver a huge wad of cash, about $1000

LAMONT
Just drive muthafucka!

The Cabdriver steps on it, speeding off

CAB DRIVER
Shit man, you need to go to a hospital?

INT. BONES’ APARTMENT

Bones sits on the couch smoking a blunt, watching television

A toilet flushes
Just as the Stripper exits the bathroom walking toward the couch...

STRIPPER
Nigga, you ain’t got no toilet pap...

POP, POP, POP, gun shots rip through the door lock, as Lamont bursts through the door with a kick, gun in hand, bleeding everywhere

As the Stripper attempts to run past Lamont, he pistol whips her in the face
She drops to the floor like a sack of potatoes, out cold

Bones drops to his knees

Lamont puts the gun to Bones’ head. Fire burns in his eyes

LAMONT
Why Bitch!!!!?

BONES
(desperate)
Please man. Please
Don’t kill me. Come on dog

Lamont just stares with rage, blood still squirting from his arm

BONES
Please don’t kill me man
I’m sorry. I got money yo!
You can have it all!
I got twenty G’s right now in the...

POP
Lamont shoots Bones in the head, splattering his brains on the couch

POP, POP
Lamont unloads two more bullets into Bones’ lifeless body at close range

Lamont exits, the sound of SIRENS approaching

EXT. 141ST AND BRADHURST AVE

As Lamont staggers out of the building onto the road, a Police car skids to a stop

Two Cops get out of the car, guns drawn

COPS
(screaming)
Get down on the ground!
Drop it motherfucker!

Lamont starts firing at the Cops. The Cops fire back

POP,POP,POP,POP. It’s a full blown shootout

A bullet hits one of the Cops in the head, he drops to the pavement in a puddle of blood

The other Cop hides behind a big truck as bullets whiz by

Once out of ammo, Lamont takes off, stumbling down a dark alley, about to pass out

EXT. PARK - MINUTES LATER

Some teens play basketball under the lights, as two younger children play on the swing set

Sounds of SIRENS and a helicopter approaching the park

Lamont stands in the center of the playground
He drops his empty pistol on the ground, reaches his bloody hand in his coat pocket, and pulls out the huge, bloody wad of cash that he had won in the dice game

Lamont throws the wad of money into the air, scattering tens of thousands of dollars around the park, blowing in the wind

Lamont, a bloody mess, looking weary, falls to a sitting position, then lays on his back looking up at the sky

A bright light envelopes him as he takes his last breaths

POV FROM ABOVE: Under the spotlight of the helicopter, Lamont lays on the ground dead, as the kids at the park hurry to gather their share of the blood stained money
