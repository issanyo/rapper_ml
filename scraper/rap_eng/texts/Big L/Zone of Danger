Stealing runs rampant in Harlem
Gambling runs rampant in Harlem
All types of evils and vices that terrified our community
Run rampant in Harlem

The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them fagots diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles

I beat chumps 'til they head splits, then break em like breadsticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' Tecs, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects layin' threats

I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in hell
Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thievin' squad, and none of us believe in God

Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own

I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six
In the mix, straight from H E-double hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil son's way

Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man
Won't hit a girl well I ain't real cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill

I'm takin' lives for a great price, I'm the type
To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L smash stress, cause hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids
Be wakin' up cryin', yellin', Mommy Big L is comin' to get me

Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own

Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own

I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be runnin' up
Can I get your autograph L? No bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts

I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it
A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented

And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Aiyyo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special Ed so I suggest
You spread pretzelhead, 'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own

Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the danger zone
Where no man can withstand or hold his own
