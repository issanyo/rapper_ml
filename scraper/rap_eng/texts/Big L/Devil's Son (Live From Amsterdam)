Check it out now check it out now
Turn the mic up
Yo rewind it back
I like the way that went down
Rewind that shit one more time, fuck that
Let's go, one more time
WHEN I WAS TWELVE

"When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus" (3x)
"I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns"

I explain the story, check it out
Aiyyo five slash three o slash seven fo' (5-30-74)
A little bro' was born with the mind of a psycho
They first knew I was a crazy nigga
When my mother came home and found out I killed the babysitter
I did more crime in due time
Started my life of crime, about nine going out for mine
I made every little kid from my hood run
I was just like that little bastard from the Good Son
And my mind was past bugged
Dropped the blowdryer in the water while my moms in the bathtub
Then I just saluted as she electrocuted
They got booted cause that's another I executed
I was a child runnin' wild like a goosechase
Punish my dad I put poison in his toothpaste
Then I picked my infant sister up gave her a quick spank
Then dropped the little bitch in the fish tank
I invited company, murdered the four guests
Put a cap in each whore chest and ate their raw flesh
I tell the truth I ain't lyin' man
And right now I got my cousin Brian hand in a fryin' pan
Yeah
