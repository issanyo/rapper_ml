The flow I be pumping that shit ass flow mumble rappers say I be flushing and now my piss on the mumble rappers thrones had pipes standing up when they sit and now It's gushing, Call a plumber to go the kingdom and make em' be plumbing, Still Missing that bitch I was loving she was fucking stunning but as soon she lied to the public she I couldn't be trusting man so much shit she wanted to say about how our relationship wasn't working out but now we got in a fight now the things In her mind she wanted to say where gone and her head didn't look like a pumpkin now I'm here on the fuckin' throne with my blunt and we be puffing yet I'm still fucking hoes and I still feel uncomplete Without her and not cumming remember them days where I made hips moved they where thrusting and her body I was touching and fucking Dick was pulsing, I was rubbing and hugginf but as soon she didn't want to date we both where shrugging, Now I got two cards Life and death I'm shuffling my brains buffering I don't Know what I'm becoming I'm just cutting, My wrist slit I can't get no love hypnotized kiss, Still on the phone with her we still talking but I don't have the courage to Say "Miss you" Man I'm just gonna go to my comfort zone with a life storage supply of fucking tissues, My Life and numbness with sadness I can fucking combine, I'm just wasting for Death to come infront of the fucking line

[Chorus: XDIPX, Young Misty, Lil Cody]
