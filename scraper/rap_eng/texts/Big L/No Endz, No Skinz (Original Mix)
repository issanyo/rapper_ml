[Big L]
Let me get to the point real quick
When you're wearin' slick shit, chicks be on a nigga dick
When you sportin' fresh jewels and drivin' in a groovy car
All the bitches gon' sweat you like a movie star
To get in ya pockets, is what them hoes wanna do
But if you not rich, then the bitch is gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only get ass when you got cash and you're on a map
Cause if you're broke, you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough, you'll get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
If ya live alone, the bitch is gonna pack her suitcase
And move in, then ya start losin' all ya bucks
Soon you broke, fucked up and outta luck
Then she takes off and breaks North
Your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here, the good relationship's been torn
Cause when you're on top, everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play (no play)

If you don't got ends, you won't be gettin' no skins
If you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots (knockin' no boots)

Hoes in the nineties ain't nothin' but crooks
It's all about what's in ya pockets and fuck how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leavin' niggas for the next man, cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some bitches barely speak but always askin' for a dollar
And if you're pushin' a fresh Benz
They'll be your best friends
Yeah, as
Long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes sellin' jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin' 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you're dead broke, the bitches stop speakin'
Cause nowadays, hoes want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big dick
Cause when you're on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play (no play)

If you don't got ends, you won't be gettin' no skins
If you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots

If you don't got ends, you won't be gettin' no skins
If you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots (knockin' no boots)

I tell it like it is cause I'm a bold nigga
And I hate a money hungry ho, a.k.a. gold digga
Bitches used to treat me like a shit stain
Then I started to get fame and all o' that shit changed
It ain't even funny
Some bitches don't know me, sayin': 'Can I get some money?
Bitch, what's up wit' you?
Askin' me for a buck or two?
Like I fuck with you?
I'm lookin' nothin' like ya poppa
I wouldn't give a bitch ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl asked me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
You sweat me now cause I got dumb figgas
But I remember when you told me that you didn't fuck with bum niggas
Now I'm fatter than a goose down Woolrich
Paid in Full bitch, so save that bullshit
Y'all used to dis, but now y'all wanna kiss?
Yo D, yo I'm a break it down like this (down like this):

If you don't got ends, you won't be gettin' no skins
If you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be gettin' no ass
And if you're not clockin' loot, you won't be knockin' no boots (knockin' no boots)

It's like that y'all
And that's a fact y'all
I hit bitches from the back and don't give 'em jack y'all
It's Big L y'all
I'm livin' swell y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells y'all (bells y'all)
