[Big L]
I keep a stash full of cash puffin grass with a dash of some hash
Jeans be sagging off half of my ass
I keep it ghetto still I'm a fly fellow
I love the cuties nomatter if they dark skin or high yellow
My iceberg sweaters and leathers are raw
I'm getting chedda galore like never before
I can pull a dime quicker than Dillinger can pull a heist
I rock the blue face presidential full of ice
Me and my crew is sick like the flu
So what you gone do boo when we come for you HUH?
It ain't no calling time out once I climb out
The garbage can with two nines out and blow your spine out

How could you call yourself emcees? This is from the hood I know you feel me
How could you call yourself emcees?
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
How could you call yourself emcees? This is from the hood I know you feel me
How could you call yourself emcees?
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned

Ayo my whole entourage is large from here to Vegas
Imitators hate us cause we sport gators and flavors
Put snitches in boxes coppers and federals watch us
They tried everything in this world to lock us but can't stop us
I'm known for rocking tours picture me mopping floors
Only fuck with Kis and not the kind that be locking doors
What I recite be taking hours to write
So if you bite just tell your man what kind of flowers you like
I be that buck wild foul criminal who make the women smile
It's time to drop something new it been a while
And L is that nigga you expect to catch wreck on any casette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet

How could you call yourself emcees? This is from the hood I know you feel me
How could you call yourself emcees?
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
How could you call yourself emcees? This is from the hood I know you feel me
How could you call yourself emcees?
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
