[Intro: Akon]
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost, and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to everyday
Welcome to my sunny day

[Verse 1: Akon]
Block don't stop, always stay hot
No matter how the season scorch
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock, then I got popped
Realized I had to stop
Then I took time to explore a better way
Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

[Bridge: Akon]
Who'd ever thought that I would see this day (I would see this day)
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away (fade away)
Cause I was lost, and couldn't find a way (find a way)
And now I look forward to everyday (everyday)

[Hook: Akon]
Welcome to my sunny day, my sunny day
Everyday, better day
Welcome to my sunny day, my sunny day
Everyday, better day
Welcome to my sunny day

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I was born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Saw my first 9 millimeter in the ghetto
I got my first kiss in the ghetto
Playin' hide go seek with the girls in the ghetto
I wrote my first hit in the ghetto
Yo Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday-ay-ay
It's hard for me to let go, life in the ghetto
The night they blast my cousin, whoa
I had to find a way out the ghetto
Picked up the guitar, started singin' in the ghetto
Haters used to hate in the ghetto
Said I would have never made it out the ghetto
I guess that's why my cousin sold the yayo
Even though Annie said the sun come out tomorrow
But the ghetto stay dark
I never thought I'd ever see the Billboard charts

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Akon]
Been a long day, on my way
To my holy place to pray
Give thanks for every blessing given to me
I know there's more to see, more to me
No more living in misery
Cause this how I vision life to be
Search high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know there's a sunny day

[Bridge]
