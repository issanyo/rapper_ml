I need somebody I can call my own to call my home
Cause basically I'm all alone
Like a only child sitting quiet with a phony smile
Use to have friends but I'm lonely now and uh
My every morning, noon and nights are great and uh
It's kind of hard to live my life this way
I need someone who's true without the games and the funny ways
Someone who can turn my rainy nights into sunny days

[Stephen Simmonds]
My fate has been sealed, my fate has been shown
It's left me no shield, it's left me alone
The lonely one's weak, but doesn't lay down
The lonely one speaks when no one's around
It's cold when you're outside and warm when you're in
I've followed my instincts, so life is my sin
Love is my witness, love is my truth
Lord is the judge for me and for you

Since you left me, no longer sex me, straight up neglect me
