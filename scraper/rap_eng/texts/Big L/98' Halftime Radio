Ya'll cats like to stress them chicks, impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks, I sex them chicks
And send them home, Corleone known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm, pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the gray bm, went to the atm
Took a thou' out and later on I had to wild out
In da club knock some kid and his pal out
Afterwards, went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' what chick number I can dial out
Cuz its L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady, and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks, but I'm tryina sell records like Garth Brooks
So F em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips, keep my celly on, mega ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, I guess its Perignon
If the nana's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
I've been off the scene over 2 years, and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop an ill verse, so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first
I sport da bulletproof, fitted-hat, that attitude you betta get rid of that
Whereava u floss is where u gon get it at
What, stay strapped, go to sleep wit my steel
Makin figures while u broke cats is keepin it real
L is raps most livest cat, gettin stacks while u askin people "do u want fries with that"?
I rob fags in da staircase, no mask, bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase, keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without cash? No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the OJ trial

Yo while we hold gats, you hold knives
When you sold 8's, we sold pies
When you rode bikes, we drove 5's
There's no comparison son, it's just embarrasing
I'm runnin with some of the baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crap cats is holdin
Playa hatin, pushin stolen whips
We at the dice game rollin trips, out of town throwin bricks
Takin over, cookin up coke with baking soda
I buy hot jewels and ice it down, while you go to the jewelry store with short doe tryna bring the prices down
You better spread with them 30 dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on, knocked out cold, and pissed on
L is a heavyweighter with steady paper
You the type to go to jail for a petty caper
Then come home on good behavior
Talkin bout you no longa hard now cuz you a man of God now
Yo it's amazin, L is blazin, always been
Before I put the braids in, I use to let the waves spin
What you be sayin don't impress me at all
Them chicks you be jayin donit be sexy at all
Word life, to everything that I recite stand out
Go head and front so I can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw, L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce the law
You got sumthin to say, then cough it out
Cuz cats be wantin beef, but when you pull out the heat
They ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about, you was just fronting now it ain't nuthin
Ain't that sumthin, I should start bussin anyway
Put one of you punks in the ground
Ya'll cats be killin me with ya'll faces frown, jumpin around
Like you scared of L, not even, cuz imma be a thug until I stop breathin
Plus I'm runnin' with a real smooth crew that'll shoot at you
You wanna knuckle up, whateva, we can do that too
