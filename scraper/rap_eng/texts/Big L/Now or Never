[Hook]
It's time to make power moves and get the chedda
And buy the real nice things that makes life better
No foolish acts, moves must be clever
I'm down for whatever, I gotta blow son, it's now or never

[Verse 1]
I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smothered with cops
I must warn, my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond, we leave mics torn
Y'all brothers slept too long, now it's on
L Corleone will never flop, records are forever hot
Front on me, you better not
I keep the Barreta cocked
This goes out to my people's up town
Downtown, mid town, across town, and outta town
You see me flossin often, at all the club sites
At the bars buyin Cristals like they bud lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces get the digits, chicken heads get the wrong number

[Chrous]

[Verse 2]
Yo I announce facts
When I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot, got a spot on every block
Honeys that’s very hot get slid to the Marriott
95' was a beautiful year for L
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L
Whatever I write is gonna be tight
Cos if makin' hits is wrong I don't wanna be right
Never the less, the East is were my crew rest
We bust caps that go through vests
We only do what we do best
And that's cripplin' you brittle men
Since you wanna play rough, then say hello to my little friend

[Hook] {X2}

[Verse 3]
I like drop tops when it's hot
I like Lands when it's snowy
Bank account is fat like Joey
I'm not very religious, you wouldn't call me holy
Sometimes my hair’s corn-rowed, sometimes its fro-y
Spark up the you know what, pop the moey
L stay flossin, Presidential Rolly
Y'all brothers know me, I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks
And every girl I got looks like a model
If you ever see me with a chicken then she must of a hit the lotto
Uptown is my home, and where I roam
I stand alone, Big L Corleone got it sewn
Sellin' weight in and outta state to generate cake
The one jakes hate
Got homicide, runnin' out of yellow tape
I pack toast with infra red scopes, I turn crews to dead folks
If y'all fellas is playas, I'm the head coach

[Hook] {X2}

Word up son It's time to blow
Stack that dough create a better life for me and my fam knaa i mean
I've seen the ghetto all my life, its time i see some different
Get the picture... The big picture
