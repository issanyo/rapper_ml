[Big L]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, Big L
Uh, Corleone
A.k.a. Tommy Gibbs (hah)
Flamboyant Entertainment
D.I.T.C., forever
Word up
I’m tired of these punk niggas O
We gonna hit ‘em like this, check it out

[Verse 1:Big L]
Yo, while y'all standin’ on the corner, bummy and high
I'm out buyin’ the finest things money can buy
Cats frontin’ like they holdin’ but them crabs is broke
Chippin’ in for ten dollar bags o’ smoke
All on my back, because o’ the fame and the wealth
You male groupie, you oughta be ashamed o’ yaself
Plus I'm runnin’ with thugs who bust slugs at the heat
I be the MC who mad chicks be lovin’ to meet
And I'm not just a rapper, I got drugs on the street
I swear you never catch Corleone with Lugz on his feet
If you think I'm not as nice as whoever, then put your money up
Put your jewels up, whatever, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, punk, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead, make a lotta bloodshed
Turn your tux red, far from broke, got enough bread
Mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothin’ but-head

[Hook:O.C]
Go all out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)
All out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)


[Verse 2:O.C.]
True indeed L, I hear these niggas talkin’ out their mouth slick
Mad ‘cause they bitches all on our dick
Peepin’ us out at the bar, checkin’ out what kind of champagne we sip
Jealous o’ the ice on my wrist
We pop Don and Cris’, no less
Hard pressed motherfuckers chippin’ in for White Star Moet
Chicken heads flock around us, thug niggas protect us
At the end o’ the night, all the hoes want to sex us
While y'all stand stagnated with blue balls
You face the song, "You'll Never Find" like Lou Rawls, shit
How the fuck a nigga with two good hands and feet
Be a bum and not survive in the streets?
Get your weight up, right now, we ain't promised later
Do what you gotta do to get them big headed papers
Even if it mean you and your team pullin’ a caper
Instead of going out like Pushead & Black, straight up

[Hook:O.C]
It's time to go all out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)
All out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)


[:Big L]
Check it, my shit’s so hot, I give the mic a heat rash
I keep cash, you couldn't pay me to rhyme if the beat trash
I stay bulletproofed up, Benz Coup-ed up
When it's cold, I rock the mink or I’m Triple Goose-d up

[O.C.]
No doubt we're souped up, arrogant as fuck
Niggas can't touch what we holdin’ when it comes to the buck
I push the double R, ride through the city like a star
Dough bulgin’ out my pockets like my dick be hard

[Big L]
I gotta go see Poppi and snatch this brick up
But first I'm a smack this bitch up ‘cause she scratched my six up
I ain't the one to tax or stick up, cats get hit up
Frontin’ on me, y'all niggas got nothin’ on me

[O.C.]
Yo, let's double the cream and stick Poppi and hold ‘em for ransom
Keep the bricks, sell 'em all, triple the pie and some
Kill two birds with one stone, get full blown
Tango and Cash, live niggas, Mush and Corleone

[Hook:O.C]
Go all out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)
All out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!
(Alright, alright, okay okay)
