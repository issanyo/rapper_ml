[Fat Joe]
Diggin In The Crates 9-9
Don Carta bomb harder
Uh, still diggin ya'll
Yeah, Big L, yeah
Yeah, there's only one way for me to explain
The key to this game is longev, keep it the same
The seeds'll remain, only if they bringin the pain
Hip-hop won't stop like the heat in my veins
The streets know my name, Don Carta bomb harder
My persona is honored in the Bronx as my alma matter
I'm smarter than the average Joe, packin a flow
That's stackin the dough, bring the triz in the bag and let's go
It's Fat Joe, I'mma set it straight
If you do your hist. I exist through Diggin In The Crates
Bringin in the ace, had to stay up late
Playin the corners but never seen a day upstate
Til the day I escape or see Tone at the pearly gates
I continue to run shit even after the computer breaks
You know the rates, fifty-thou for every verse that's foul
As I bring rhymes to life like the birth of a child

Chorus [Armaggedon]
We all self-centered, it's our world you just in it
Check the VIP part of the club, flooded wit women
Push a plush tinted truck wit thugs in it
You never catch any one of us broke wit no dubs drivin the limit
It's our way of life, you in the game better play it right
Buy a house wit only my chains, so playa name your price
Fly nigga, since we was crawlin, you can ask our pops
You ain't really ballin wit that, so nigga pass the rock

[Big L]
Check it, my whole crew holdin
We all got rides wit extra features
It's a bunch of ya'll, one got dough, the rest is leeches
You probably mad cuz I be sexin divas
I should pull this pistol out and make you touch your sneakers
I'm on some cool out shit, but I will pull this tool out quick
And put some holes in your new outfit
You frontin hard cuz you whip a Range
But it's a 4.0, you nerd nigga, you heard Jigga now get your change
You ain't a willy you a small soldier
Give it up son it's all over
And you never sold a, pound of cane
You a clown wit fame, goin down the drain
All yo' shit sound the same
I'mma shine pop-o, cuz when you got dough your rocks glow
L got a hot flow that rap capo
I'm Uptown's smoothest, my first album left you clowns clueless
Sayin I'm wack, you niggas sound foolish
Niggas hate to see L bubble, they'd rather see L struggle
Cuz what they sell, I'mma sell double
You wanna see rocks, then look at L's wrist
If you see me in the club drinkin Mo' that means they don't sell Cris, what!

Chorus
