[Intro]
Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

[Verse 1]
Check it, my weed smoke is my lye
A ki of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high
With new clothes on I'm fly
Cars is whips
And sneakers is kicks
Money is chips
Movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes
Jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy
Cigarettes is bones
A radio is a box
A razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks
And jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck
If you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke
A choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note
A con is an okey-doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff
A bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, a burglary is a jook
A wolf's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F
If you got killed, you got left
If you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
"Hit me on the hip" means page me
Angel dust is sherm
If you got AIDS, you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease, then you got burned
Max mean to relax
Guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats
Critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub
A victim's a mark
A sweat box is a small club
Your ticker's your heart
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab
And heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

[Verse 3]
The iron horse is the train
And champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine she's a dime
A suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine
If you in love, that make you blind
Genuine is real
A face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl, that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing
Bleeding is leaking
Begging is bummin'
If you nuttin', you cummin'
Taking orders is sonnin'
An ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly
A cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly
Your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L, you took a loss
To show off mean floss
Uh, I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

[Hook]
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang)
That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

[Outro]
Yeah yeah
One love to my big brother
Big Lee
Holdin' it down
Yeah
Flamboyant for life
Yeah yeah flamboyant for life
