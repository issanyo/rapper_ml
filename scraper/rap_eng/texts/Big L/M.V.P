[Verse 1]
Ayo, spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend? A'ight, then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 2]
Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 3]
Battles I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
