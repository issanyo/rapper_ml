[Verse 1: 2Pac]
When I enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles
Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You're marked
Watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til its none left

[Hook: Big Pun]
"Thug Nigga" Keeping it blood my people is bugged
Heat you with slugs hundred deep in the club
"Big Poppa" The Big NORE and Pun
We're warriors from goriest and the most notorious slums
"Corleone" Thugs in the heart we bug from the start
Rugged and smart anyone who want it fuck it lets mob
"When the punisher ready" Just rest
Learnt from TS from god flesh

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G]
Frank White the Desperado
Used to rock the all-black Movado
The all-black El Dorado
All that and a bottle of Dom P
Niggas can't harm me
I keep the army
Is Brooklyn in the house
Without a doubt
I'm the rapper with clout everybody yap about
Check it out
Guns, I bust em
Problems with my wife
Don't discuss em
Coupes and Learjets
I lust them
Finger prints
I dust them
Recent address
Stuck you for your stash in your pissy mattress
Your Mom's an actress
Didn't wanna show me the safe
It's okay, she was old anyway
I display, Hot 97 rhyme-ready
Cocked Mac-11, line steady
Like Tevin Campbell
I'm Ready
To do what I do
Continuously to get money

[Hook: Big Pun]

[Verse 3: Big L]
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hard core life I toast to ex flaw
Therefore I live raw and went to war wit the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs were thugs got pot
Get swellin hops from sellin tops to the drugs spot
G's was clocked fat knots was in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
Cause we put the guns down and go one round
Wit the hands but man I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style, cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin worse than foul
I pack two techs in case ya crew flex
I wet up the set in a second yell whos next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn ya staff into a blood bath then laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you softer than jelly jack
I attack in black wit a gat and a skully hat

[Hook: Big Pun]

[Verse 4: Big Pun]
No doubt I'm from the X and I seen it all
Shorties wit dreams of playin ball for Seton Hall turnin fiends a full
From Meda ward to Sacuon the same sad song
Is bein sung, its like gimmie a gun and I'm back on
Joey Crack, Pun, TS, Bronx regulators
Stomp little niggas to death for tryin to imitate us
Yall could neva see us, be us, TS, kill da bs
Cause Pun got more guns and funds than Undeas
Un be us, I'm from the BX so I have to roll
Blast the 4 crash ya door smash ya ho
Hack off ya skull, I'm stackin heads like totem poles
Blow a hole in ya colon throw you from here to Fordan road
Blow for blow, I toe to toe with the toughest
Brung the ruckas to the roughest muthafucka its nothin but luckstress
My crews are cussin to bustin ass crushin glass
In niggas faces leavin traces of red out this bloody bath
