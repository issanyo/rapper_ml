[Intro x2]
Worldwide
Time to handle our biz
Down with the crew called diggin' in the crates

[Hook]
Thick is how I got my whole click to sound
Thick is how we gets down from town to town
If you didn't know this click can't be touched
If your click ain't thick you ain't fucking with us

[A.G.]
We on a world tour with Midnight Mauraders and such
I'm at the table like the Godfather smoking a dutch
Controlling the bucks, I roll with enough
Niggas that'll blow in the clutch
Not only holding we bust
The fat raps, so pass that and let me hit it
Got me gassed, black, skins was mad fat
She flipped it, Bronx is equipped with, niggas that'll rip shit
Studios get blown from D&D to Mystic
With this shit, I'll bomb the nation from a distance
The jewels, gotta have patience plus persistance
We rock glass like Rockford
Waiting for bottles to pop in the condo bottles get rocked
To sum up my career from bottom to top
Now we in the thick of it, and you don't stop

[Hook]

[Big L]
Check it, I be puffing blunts in the house sexing stunts on the couch
This year, a lot of frauds might get punched in the mouth
For when your wife see me, she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back, for real
Your whole team a bunch of pooh-puts who made a few bucks
Date a few sluts then y'all start running your lips a little too much
My whole crew wild, thick as new now
We go to clubs, hit the bar, and trip 2 thou
Other MC's ain't got a chance at all
Cause Big L Corleone is to advanced for y'all
Chicks can never walk away cause they like the sex
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
I'm a pimped-out nigga that walks with canes
Talk with slang, ball from New York to Spain
Haters E-N-V-Y me B-I-G
Cause I'm V.I.P. til I D-I-E, what?

[Hook]

[O.C.]
I spark light with the pen, drink O.J. with gin
Rock Tims with my laces untied
Cruise in the city on 17 inches, ride past wenches
Past the projects, thugs chilling on the benches
Profile low as if I had an ill vengence
Life on earth is just a death sentence
Fuck it, alpha omega, arm lega lega arm
With cold steel if you pose a threat to my neighbor
D-I double G I-N, I-N T-H-E Crates, lock shit times ten
Dive in, become part of a cliche, that art of an expert
Your honor from New York to Florida
Chicks rush the corridors, chicks try to star with us
Besides rolling thick my whole crew be marvelous

[Hook]
