Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

[Verse 1: Big L]
Check it, my weed smoke is my lye
A ki of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted, I'm high
With new clothes on, I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
A radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got rubbed, you got stuck
You got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is a okey doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it

[Hook] {X2}
"Speak with criminal slang" -Nas
That's just the way that I talk, yo
"Vocabulary spills, I'm ill" -Nas

Remix Rex dawg, uh

[Verse 2: T-Rex]
Check it
Your bank account is your funds
A bunch of singles is ones
Pussy is buns, toaks is your gun
Your smoke box is your lungs and your doge is your son
Spitting is rhyming, the bing is the island
Bling bling is diamonds
Stumped out is wylin'
Acting silly is childish
Beef is busting your man
Masterbations fucking your hand
The plot is a gun and a plan
Relationship is a one-night stand
Snitching is singing
Fighting is banging, chilling is hanging
My evil maintain it, from one crew to the next they're muturating
The double is Satan, bleeding is payin'
If you fly then you're stakin', a hoopties a Lincoln
If you frontin' you faking, cops is bacon
Pussy is drinking, cock-blocking is hating
You can't forget if you fall then you're fainting
OBT is the duds, DT's is cops
Rest in peace TO Big L, man your soul never rot
OGT

[Verse 3: Big L]
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine, she's a dime
A suit is a fine, jewelry is shine
If you in love, that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneakin' to go see a girl, that mean you creepin'
Smilin' is cheesin', bleedin' is leakin'
Beggin is bummin, if you nuttin you comin
Takin' orders is sunnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took a L, you took a loss
To show off mean floss, uh
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
