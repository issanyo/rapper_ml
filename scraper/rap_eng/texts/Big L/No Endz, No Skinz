[Verse 1: Big L]
Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 2: Big L]
Girls of the 90's ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man, cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke the girls stopped speaking
Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big....
Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 3: Big L]
I tell it how it is cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl, AKA: gold-digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got endz you won't be getting no skinz
And if you don't got money you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Outro]
It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm living swell y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells y'all
If you don't got endz, girls be fronting
If you don't got endz, they ain't giving up nothing
If you don't got endz, all the girls ignore you
If you don't got endz, they act like they never saw you
If you don't got endz
