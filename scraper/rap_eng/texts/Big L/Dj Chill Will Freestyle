I’m standing strong with my squad behind me
Whoever wanna see me, come to Harlem; it ain’t hard to find me
You might catch me on Lenox Ave, hopping in a Hummer
Look out for the new smash, dropping in the summer
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I’m a never be broke
Ya'll hoes see me on Soul Train, iced out gold chain
To hell with a piece of the pie, I want the whole thang
Rap I got sewn, front, get your spot blown
Punk, don’t be mad at me cause you not known
And right now I’m on top of the world
So when you see me coming through, put a lock on your girl
