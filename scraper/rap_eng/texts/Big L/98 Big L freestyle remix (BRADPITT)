I’m kinda tired… heh

Rest in peace BIG L> BIG JErM

I’m only holding it down cause I’m on top and you see me
If  You are not from my town and you rep it you will bleed
No gang, I am not a cliché like you lame kids; trying to play hip-hop
No fuck you this is what I live, Digging in the crates
You just got cut from playing, fuck one white girl
And leave ya baby momma hanging, I’m about my history
A beat I Kay Slay it. You bout to wave a white flag when I get done with saying this
Dis track naw' I got a quick southpaw homie
Think ya whole lunch meat, bologna niggas
I be cool with CityKings, 34 felonious
So just pack it up and go the fuck back homeboy
This the big game, you woke a couple sleeping giants
I expect a swift reply, but if I were you I wouldn’t try it
You leading some boys I’m a leader of men
Yall niggas corny like bieber and them
I’m seeded at 1 and you're seeded at ten
Dude u just suck you're mosquitoing them
No love for swaggots shove nerds in a locker
I Just do all black, and I talks hot water
I be spitting flames yall are fire retarded
And yea II fucked you bitch Maury said I ain’t the father
Yall can can kick ya dumb I’ma a little smarter
So you dis me if want niggas, I ain't even bothered
I’m starving, your token or Marvin south park shit
Got finger in the air for anyone who wanna start shit
TonieG the heartless, hardest of the artists
You bargain rappers, wack shit get it for a dollar
I do the John Mayer, I be good to your daughters
I’m a little more out there a little more high
And I’m the type of rapper to put the knuckles in yo eye
I’m not playing, this rap for real TonieG or die
Straight outta north boulder, 747 high
Peace my nigga Nizz, Gwap gang pilot
I’m drink shots with Big Nate and Eliseo on an island
It’s time the credits are Rollin, and your behind
And I’m behind yo bitch that what I call on the grind
What
