[Intro: Big L, Mr Cheeks]

[Mr. Cheeks]
All right, let's get it on
We don't bring nothin' but the phat shit in New York type shit
Know what I mean?

[Big L]
No doubt

[George Murdock, as Fatman from The Mack]
I've told you before... you're too big! You're getting too big! The word has come down, it's not healthy to get too big!

[Big L]
Yeah! Flamboyant Entertainment

[Mr. Cheeks]
Bringin' nothin' but the street themes

[Big L]
One-three-nine
Don't get it twisted, the hood come first

[Mr. Cheeks]
Ayyo Big L, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Check it!
My whole clique's theavin'
We roam the streets, cause it's stick season
This ain't the time to have your wrist freezin'
I might put the big gat to your six-pack
Click-clack, let me get that
Make it quick black, skip the chit-chat
I'm takin' it all, I'm not leavin' a cent
Want everything out your pockets coward, even the lint
You better not budge when I point the semi at you
What's that, a carat in your ear? Then give me that, too!
I'm like Death, you never know when I might pop up
In your hood and let the Glock buck and shoot your block up
Go ahead, call the cops, and I'll tear the cops up
Cause I don't give a hot fuck if I get locked up
Ya'll know nothin' about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin' rap game without L?
That's like jewels without ice, that's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ, or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The village without dykes or hockey games without fights
I never hesitate to buck my gun
One-three-nine, ya'll know where the fuck I'm from

[Hook: Mr. Cheeks]
Ayyo, hittin' niggas with the real rap, remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY
Me and my men high
Stay with cash, bring nothin' but the hotness
Ya'll niggas chill kid, we got this
Hittin' niggas with the remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY
Me and my men high
Count the chedda, bring nothin' but the hotness
Ya'll niggas chill kid, we got this

[Verse 2: Big L]
Yo, I'ma real wolf
That's why you always see my face in the hood
Others is phony, so they ain't safe in the hood
I'm from where the real hustlers pile dough
The home of rich Rich Porter, AZ, Alpo
Where they shoot dice and puff wild dro and talk fly
Throwin' game at every chickenhead bitch that walk by
That's how we live, everyday, all day
From one-one-o' to one-five-five, from first Ave. to Broadway
Harlem's soft? That's what they all say
Until they get murdered in broad day in a project hallway
You get cash, you get it your way
I get mines the fast and sure way: ski-mask and four-four way
Take some wolf to your crib and kick down your doorway
Go to the Hill, stick a aww yay for a brick of raw weigh
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him
Niggas don't want it with L, they be like: Anybody but him!

[Hook: Mr. Cheeks]
Ayyo, hittin' niggas with the real rap, remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY
Me and my men high
Stay with cash, bring nothin' but the hotness
Ya'll niggas chill kid, we got this
Hittinâ€™ niggas with the remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY
Me and my men high
Count the chedda, bring nothin' but the hotness
Ya'll niggas chill kid, we got this

[Outro: Big L, Mr. Cheeks]

[Mr. Cheeks]
We got this shit on lock
You know me, I be up on Big L's block

[Big L]
One-three-to-the-nine, kid

[Mr. Cheeks]
We be hangin' with my niggas
Every day I want the ex-po
Yo, do a show Uptown, Boogie Down

[Big L]
Comin' straight from the streets

[Mr. Cheeks]
Back to Queens, be the same routines

[Big L]
Corleone and Mr. Cheeks

[Mr. Cheeks]
Hold the fort
These niggas thought
We ain't comin'?

[Big L]
Yeah, Flamboyant

[Mr. Cheeks]
Representin' the Boogie Down
Man, tell me somethin'

[Big L]
Yeah, Flamboyant

[Mr. Cheeks]
We be comin' through
What you see? What!

[Big L]
Uh, Flamboyant, ya'll

[Mr. Cheeks]
Somethin' in the rear?
Yo we up in here!

[Big L]
Yeah, uhh, no doubt! Ha-ha!
