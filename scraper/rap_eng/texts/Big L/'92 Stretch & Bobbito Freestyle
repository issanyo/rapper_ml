[Big L]
Word, check it out check it out check it out
Bust it
MCs get taught a lesson
When the mic is in my possession
Rap's my profession. L is nice, no question
It's a fact I stay geared. It shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared cause my raps are rougher than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm Def like Jef right to left
My raps are badder than morning breath
With niggas deaths I'm the number one suspect
Cause I catch much wreck, 'specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedystar breaking them up and then taking they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be ripping the microphones apart
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic, niggas be like shorty hype
I'm smoother than Velvet, my lyrics is well writ'
You saying L's this and L's that get off L's dick
Rhymes I create a knock out ya gold tooth
Battling me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and drop the cool speeches
Nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers
One two, one two, rappers I run through
Fuck Karate, I practice Gun-Fu
The Big L is an assassinator
I grab the Mag and leave a fag leakin' like activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and...
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up
Peace
