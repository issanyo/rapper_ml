Welcome to "Animal House"
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'mma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a "Hello" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I wanna make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album #3 and
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently #1 at 3 with videos on MTV
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Hook]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high cuz we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high cuz we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire cuz what I propose is a resonation
Cuz the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and "ang" espacio

[Hook]

[Verse: Angie]
Look I'mma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant cuz bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearseals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio
Through the many years blood sweatin tears
Be clear happy to be here on the sequel I'm still workin
I know you got hate in your blood it's still hurtin

[Hook] - repeat 2X
