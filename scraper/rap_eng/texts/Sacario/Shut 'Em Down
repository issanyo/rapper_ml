It's a big deal now, It's official now
Shut 'em down.Wha'cha think we ain't got beats?
We got beats.anyway you wanna do it
Uh.Sacario.Uh
You ready?.Let's Go

Look at Shorty My nigga introduced us
I neva told a Shorty I said Dema la Puca
She said Orjay Flicka
But that's how I talk but see what I get though
I got the baddest shortys you see on Stretch-Lo
Can't let go You had to see me in Copa
Before E used to G shortys on Sodas
In Cub Vinals spit the same G on the sofa
In Club Red in Miami the G was even colder
Peep what I tell ya with the Sex on the Beach
In cup arm wrapped around the shoulder its over
And she knew what I was talking about
My games' sick (Like What?)
Like someone came and coughed in my mouth
I get tilted by the pound and of course on the house
And you know I'm from up North so I floss in the South
They want to know what New York is about
Cause they been sayin No Doubt before Gwen Steffani was out
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(you can't be serious.uh.Sacario)
Playa's ya'll play y'all position
I got so much game I need a license from the gaming commission
You in training listen I've been with famous women
Cause I ain't a kid I don't talk lame or diss 'em
When I see 'em don't even kiss 'em not on the cheek
Windows on the truck rolled up pockets is deep
Niggas tryin peak through the tints wha'cha you wanna see?
All you seein is the glow of the TV Believe me
I ain't wit the big crowds on the low like Chris Childs
Wanna hear me flow I can spit but only Crystal
Grippin a pistal know these niggas pissed now
Used to be stand up niggas now they just sit down
Look at this clown look who he's runnin' wit
No not Michel Johnson the only one who's runnin' shit
Be the type to take pictures in front of whips
I'm the type to have my girl kiss and bag another bitch

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

(This is how it's gonna be.uh.from now till forever)

Hey yo I'm Six One shorty know her man is little
I smell like Meakai she smell like a bag a Skittles
I ball shoot jump shots stand and dribble
Hit threes that mean triplets I'm in the middle
Big whips me and my nizzle for shizzle on the rizzle
I stay switchin my stizzle your style flow like a drizzle
I'm like a real bizzle that's bliz-ed
I don't walk if I'm not in a whip I'm on my pivot
You know metaphors I'm knee deep in
Niggas need to shut up they talk about like they got free weekends
I be on the Deacon cause its major like Lee when
That's all I know how to shorty you too young
Don't make me pow pow you and leave you with two sons
I'm not that type a foul dude when I'm on the line
Shoot five for five wit out even tryin'
Only time they call me small change when I come with dimes
Come On

[Chorus]
If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

If you really wanna I can Shut it Down
You just let me know and I'll show you how
If you ready now tell me you ready
(Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em Down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em Down)

Hahahaha
Ya'll Ain't ready for me
