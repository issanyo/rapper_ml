[Verse 1: Promise]
I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not (?)
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 2: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town

[Hook: Promise & Drake]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 3: Sacario]
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I’m not a rapper it's not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We don't like no fake, nada
Rappin' ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me
