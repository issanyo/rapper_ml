[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!!!
[Angie M] Oh yeah yeah
[Lil' Mo] Yeaaaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!
[Angie M] Uh, woo! come on, uh
[Lil' Mo] If I can go, with you
[Angie M] Yo, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can choose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states, where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Babe take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] And, since we 'bout to go, in a few
[Sacario] Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] Nothin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
And if I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
Nothing at all, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
