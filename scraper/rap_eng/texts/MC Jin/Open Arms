[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Ladies and gentlemen I need you to stop what you're doin'
So we can come together like a family reunion
Let the music take control I see your hands are groovin'
Gravitatin' to my soul I feel the spirit movin'
Hey hey I feel the spirit movin'
Hey hey I feel the spirit movin'
Hey hey I said I said
It's gravitatin' to your soul I know you feel the spirit movin'
I mean it's hard to put in words exactly what I'm feelin'
I'm tryin' to touch the sky so I'm reaching for the ceilin'
Wish I could share the joy with all men women and children
Nothin' else to say besides God is in the buildin'

It's like everyday's December 25th
To be with You is a gift
I'm so thankful for Your presents
I said I'm thankful for Your presence

[Hook]
We want You here we want You near
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
Arms wide open like I'm tryin' to land a plane
We waitin' for You like we chillin' at the baggage claim
I'm 'bout to lose my mind carrying a huge sign
That says Father God yeah we're so glad You came
Now that my heads right think I should let You know
Like a redlight I'm never gonna let You go
That's why I cherish this moment here together
Can't wait until the day that we'll be home with You forever

It's like everyday's December 25th
To be with You is a gift
I'm so thankful for Your presents
I said I'm thankful for Your presence

[Hook]
We want You here we want You near
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
Yeah Lord I bow my head and humbly welcome You in
The One who sent His Son to rescue me from my sin
Jesus my only Savior lover and friend
I can't see or touch You but I feel You like the wind
Amen! You only see the best in me
And You're here to help get rid of the rest of me
As we say farewell to our past
The last shall be first and the first shall be last
For the rest of my days the hours and the minutes
Down to the seconds Lord I want You in it
In the mean time we glorify Your name
Welcome You with open arms hoping that You'll do the same

It's like everyday's December 25th
To be with You is a gift
I'm so thankful for Your presents
I said I'm thankful for Your presence

[Hook]
We want You here we want You near
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms
Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms

Woo ohh woo ohh
We welcome You with open arms
