[Intro: Chris Belmont]
So so so precious
So so so precious
So so so precious

[Verse 1: MC Jin]
How you doin' my sister I don't know what you been through but I'm tryin' to get some clues
From the outside lookin' in all I see is a shell of a woman so confused
I couldn't tell if those on your feet are manolos or jimmy choos
So theres no way I can attempt to put myself inside your shoes
But never mind how I feel instead lets figure out how to heal your soul
Cause you throw on them high heels but deep down inside still feel so low
Searching far and wide just for someone to shower you with love
Listen closely and you'll hear the voice of your Father from above

[Hook: Chris Belmont]
Baby you are so beautiful
You don't need a thing
Don't you ever forget who you are
You're worth more than you think
I think you are
So so so precious
So so so precious
So so so precious
You mean the world to me I'll give you everything you need

[Verse 2: Heesun Lee]
You wanna know why I live like this
Why I feel like this
Well I
Wish you understood where I was comin' from
Wish you understood what I was runnin' from
You could talk all day about your father
Still no good man out there don't bother
It's gettin' harder to see good times wanna go and talk about my shoes fine
Wanna walk a mile in my footsteps see my life understand how it looks yet
No love in the household to save me
No love from a dude cause they played me
It's all about how I look come date me
It's how I live guess the clothes do make me
Maybe if I had a father to turn to
We could talk about love and I'd learn to
Be a better person when I face life it's a dream never know what it taste like
No one plays nice wanna win
They use you it's the world that we livin' in
Try and speak up no ones listenin'
Go against the grain instead of givin' in
It's real talk no one cares wanna prove me wrong lets compare
Every dude I was with didn't mind this
Only wants one things let's be honest
That's my life no reason to judge me
Don't talk about God that He loves me
Remember this when you wanna think of me
I'll make it somehow trust me

[Hook: Chris Belmont]
Baby you are so beautiful
You don't need a thing
Don't you ever forget who you are
You're worth more than you think
I think you are
So so so precious
So so so precious
So so so precious
You mean the world to me I'll give you everything you need

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
I hear you loud and clear yeah I guess you're right who am I to judge
Since I've done some of the same things that these men are guilty of
Hard to experience affection when you get treated like an object
I was just a foolish boy definitely not a man of God yet
I could make excuses but the truth is your feelings are numb
Praying you can let go cause following forgiveness healing will come
Just to win the world's approval you go the extra mile
And even though it's a rare sight true beauty lies within your smile
What's in that chanel bag besides the make up in your purse
Is pain and loss only the Lord can make up for the hurt
Been fightin' your whole life so it's hard to let your guard down
If only you knew how precious your are you'd trust in God now

[Hook: Chris Belmont]
Baby you are so beautiful
You don't need a thing
Don't you ever forget who you are
You're worth more than you think
I think you are
So so so precious
So so so precious
So so so precious
You mean the world to me

Cause baby you are so beautiful
You don't need a thing
Don't you ever forget who you are
You're worth more than you think
I think you are
So so so
So so so
So so so precious
You mean the world to me I'll give you everything you need
