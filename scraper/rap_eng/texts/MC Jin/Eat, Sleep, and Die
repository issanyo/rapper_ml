[Intro]
Somebody tell me why somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here to just eat, sleep, and die

[Verse 1]
Woke up this mornin’
The first thing to cross my mind asked myself this question
What am I doing with my time
On the grind
Grindin’ for what
A purpose I don’t even know
I just get up and go
Hope for the best
Is it a test?
Maybe so
So who got the answers
Not me but I’m searchin
And I’m certain every person that is workin’
Has a version
Of the truth
But what’s the use
Without no proof
We just arguin’ to argue nah I’d rather hit the booth
And let loose
Making use of these skills
Everyday is real
Just trying to pay these bills
Is that all there is
Or is it something bigger
Than taking care of yo business and counting all your figures
Questions keep on comin’ can’t just keep on runnin’
Gotta face the music
I do this and I love it
I was put here for a reason
I’m just trying to figure out why I know one thing
I ain’t here to just
Eat sleep and die

[Chorus]
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die
I know it’s just a lie
I know it’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die

[Verse 2]
You tell yourself
That they don’t know
What’s your plans
And what’s your goals
All that hate
Can take it’s toll
What will it take to
Save your soul
Trying to find some meaning
So you keep on dreaming
Which turn to nightmares they don’t fight fair
Still slay your demons
Screamin’ for freedom gotta keep fighting
‘til your destiny is fulfilled
Let your guard down on the battlefield
With a shattered shield might get yourself killed
I know what you’re thinkin’
You’re the captain of your own ship
So even if it starts sinkin’
No matter what happens don’t trip
Don’t take more than you give
What are you leavin’ your kids?
Cause even when you’re gone
Your legacy will still live
That’s called making an impact
In fact let it be known
That when it’s your time to go
You can’t take anything that you own
That goes for all of us
Universal law
The damage has been done
We can’t reverse the fall
You were put here for a reason
Trust me that’s no lie I’m sayin’ though
It can’t be to just eat, sleep, and die

[Ending]
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here to just eat sleep and die
Somebody tell me why
Somebody tell me why
It feels like that we’re here
To just eat sleep and die
I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die I know that’s just a lie
I know that’s just a lie
I ain’t here no I ain’t here to just eat, sleep, and die
