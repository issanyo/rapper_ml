My saliva ain't artificial, now this is real spit
Believers of the gospel, yeah that's who I deal with
Seen this try and find a way out, that's who I chill with
Go from 100 down to 0 so you can feel this
Slow it down
I was once cocky as can be
The only thing worse than that is false humidity
This is what you get at 5 in the mall
Last man standing, even the engineers gone
Step 1, take the beat and loop it
Step 2, say something profound or real stupid
Either way I guess it's worth pursuing cause if not here's what I potentially be doing:
Browsing WORLDSTAR killing my brain cells faster
If not I'm reading tweets between Lupe and Dizaster
Either options not productive to say the least so now I'm chewing on this beat
Lyrics spewing through my teeth
Lets keep it 100
Being faith is one
I've got 99 problems a lack of faith ain't one
'82 that's when I came into the picture
And my prime like [?] playing for the 76ers
Every ball is defined
Ain't no telling where these lines come from
Not even with *69
It's a 50/50 chance, it's either I'm wrong or I'm right
Noah flow, I can go on 40 days, 40 nights
Study the water report with Capone or Rodieaga
Protect your neck when you went to the 36th chamber
Broke the cash rules no longer blinded by the money
You know what they say, hindsight is always 20/20
I got 15 minutes better maximise on time, #JourneyTo1459
Think twice before you idolise a rapper like a hero, I ain't hating though just going 100 down to 0
