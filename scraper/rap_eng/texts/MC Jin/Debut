Shout out to the emojins
And the emojins only

Yo if you out here clout chasin’
I suggest that you just stop
Oh you ain’t heard watch the curve
There’s a new bias on the block
I know somebody gettin’ cancelled
If they dare call this a flop
What you sayin’ ?
It’s a bop
It’s a bop
It’s a bop
This is strictly for intellectuals
Please do not get it confused
If we ain’t mutuals then we ain’t cool
I don’t make the rules
Tryin’ to get noticed feel hopeless
But beggin’ that’s just not cool
‘cause guess what all you’ll end up
Is lookin’ like boo boo the fool
They keep askin’
Why are you like this
Is it a mood
I reply in fashion being extra is
What I do
Adopting sons and daughters
Left and right like I was mad
Now you see why
Chance ain’t the only one
To call me dad

I love you dada see you soon

Chorus :
Guess who’s coming
Guess who’s coming
They shookt I know it’s true
Guess who’s coming
Guess who’s coming
They wanna anti who
Guess who’s coming
Guess who’s coming
You’ll be wheezing when I’m through
Yeah I’m a skinny legend
And this is my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Welcome to my debut
Once I hit the stage
Watch the whole world
Say uwu

Second verse
Shout out to my ult that’s The Wife
She’s oomf plus she loves me irl
In real life
Tea for Three that’s my fam
Yeah we wholesome and we happy
If that ain’t relatable
Do me a favor please don’t at me
But this is where it’s at
If you want somethin’ that’s pure
You a multifandom go ahead
‘cause I ain’t insecure
All I do is kill the beat
Chicken wings is what I love
Sippin’ tea won’t be me
You see crying in the club
This ain’t a come back
Just a fun rap honestly that only took
A few minutes to do
Mc jin I’m your spirit animal
That you know you won’t find in a zoo
Back to the facts it get snatched so fast
You won’t even know where’s your wig at
Here’s a concept that ain’t complex
I did that

Chorus : x1

I know you could be anywhere
In the world right now but
Thank you for coming to my ted talk
Uh huh I just wanna say
Thank you for coming to my ted talk

Chorus : x1
