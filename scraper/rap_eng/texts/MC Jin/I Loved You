I can't believe you broke my heart
I loved you girl
Damn
I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)
I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)

Remember how it all came to be?
I ain't look for you
Your love came to me
You're the weed, the philly that takes my stress away
I see it clearly, like it was yesterday
It was December
One week before Christmas
Told Santa you had a man on your wish list
Then, poof, I magically appeared
The one you been waitin for it had to be for years
Wutchu want ma? That smirk's a disguise
Don't front ma, I see the hurt in your eyes
Sophisticated, plus she be workin them thighs
I'm right here, you ain't gotta be flirtin with guys

I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)
I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)

Other chicks talk shit cuz they jealous of you
All I do is talk to the felluhs bout you
She's the one that I'm quick to discuss
Look up love in the dictionary, see a picture of us
When she's not around I feel sick and disgust
I don't like the attitude? She's quick to adjust
You can ask her who she's with
Opinionated, but far from a choosey chick
A boughy chick, that's my main preference
Ghetto and classy all in the same sentence
Who woulda thought the one I fell head over heels for
Lied to my mama, prolly killin me or steal for
Would be the same one to shatter my heart
Into a million pieces like it don't matter at all
I gave you my soul and everything that came with it
All I got in return was a card with your name in it?
Damn

I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)
I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)

See time goes by and surely I've grown some
I'll never forget when you left me by my lonesome
Tears dry and I start to laugh
I got a bright future and you're a dim part of my past
Ain't it a shame cuz of the actions you chose
Switched my whole demeanor and now I'm mackin the hoes?
Got me thinkin chicks are a damn hassle
No bringing sand to the beach, I'm buildin sand castles
Lost your mind when you saw me on the screen
Blowin up my cell, actin like a fiend
When you see me at a show, you can call my name
But I'm tellin you now, it'll be all in vein
I ain't lookin back, don't try to act dense
You heard the hook, I LOVED you, that's in the past tense
I'm tellin you now, things'll never be the same
Here's a penny for your thoughts bitch, keep the change

I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)
I loved you
(I loved you)
But you left me all alone
(Why'd you leave me girl?)
