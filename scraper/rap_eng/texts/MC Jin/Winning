Annotate[Intro]
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil, for you are with me
Your rod and your staff, they comfort me

[Verse 1: Jin]
When they hit you in the chest you gon' feel this
They say I ain't the best well thats okay I'm the realest
Don't be fooled this man game is smoke and mirrors
What you hear what you see dont get caught up in appearance
Don't want to be a slave to my own image those days are finished (Lord help me)
I just want to see the big picture even if its by my selfie
You can have the world I just want the freedom ain't nothing ya'll can tell me
I know what your thinking (thats ill) (not uh) thats healthy
They look at us like "Lord they be winning" Nah we just over here keeping a tradition
See life can pass you buy better get up on that bus
I slow down and smell the roses ain't no need for me to rush

[Hook: Jin]
(Yeah) We gon' blow up when the times right
We were sent here to get your mind right
You see them hatin' because we gifted
We ain't even tryna be different

Yeah we still WINNING WINNING WINNING
We ain't tryna be different we WINNING WINNING WINNING
We ain't tryna be different we WINNING (hey) WINNING (hey) WINNING (hey)


[Verse 2: Jin]
