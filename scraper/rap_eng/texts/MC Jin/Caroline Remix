[verse 1: LudaKris]
Yeah
If this the shit I'm working with
Then I better find a helpful bitch
Cuz I ain't watching niggas like this
I'd rather be recording a song with Ludacris
I ain't new to this
This crazy shit
I ain't feelin it
Yeah
If I had to describe this work
I only use one word
Shitty as hell I don't recommend it
All the people do is talk shit
Dead niggas in the party
I'm so sorry but
You gotta learn I don't do this a lot
I'm like Jack The Ripper I never get caught
I only used dagger so no one was ever shot

[hook: KRNFX]
I ain't feeling it
This crazy shit
I ain't feeling it
This ain't it

[verse 2: Timothy DelaGHETTO]
Yeah
If this the shit I'm working with
Then I better find a helpful bitch
Cuz I ain't watching niggas like this
I'd rather be recording a song with Ludacris
I ain't new to this
This crazy shit
I ain't feeling it
Yeah
If I had to describe this work
I only use one word

You gotta learn I don't do this a lot
I'm like Jack The Ripper I never got caught
I only used a dagger so no one was ever shot

[outro: MC Jin]
I ain't feeling it
I ain't feeling it
I ain't feeling this crazy shit
I'm licking this girl in the tip
If a black boy wants to fight he'll get bit
