Get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And wherever you see us we gon' kick it, its all love (now I)
Get high get low
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And wherever you see us we gon' kick it, its all love

[Verse 1: Jin]
Now ma whole set get love
I'm in the Chi two steppin wit them thugs
And big man you can search all you want
But you ain't gon' find no drugs or no guns
Yea y'all can get weeded up, beated up
But don't eat it up this ain't a slow jam so I can speed it up (lets go)
I ain't sparkin a meadow
I jus want to talk to the ghetto
Bag the baddest chick with the sharpest stilettos
Im so influential, you so impotential
Man you gon' know what I'm workin wit
When I hold it against you
Destination vip you can follow us
But if it was the last sip well jus follow us
Shorty feelin my style because I'm humerous
Put me on cloud nine and its accumulous
Assume its us Jin, mista quick to diss ya
And Twista spit so fast ya lips'll blista

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Now I get high get low (get low)
Thick girls go and shake ya big butt (like this)
You in the club wit some some worldwide thugs
And whereva you see us we gon' kick it, its all love

[Verse 2: Twista]
When I come in the party betta get high
Cuz I pulled up in the platinum seven six five
Who say lyrical niggas don't know how to party
See me jackin up shawtys wit a grippin on her thick thighs
I like the way she workin that badunkadunk
Bouncin the fatty when the base go bump
She witness how Twista spit it
So now she want me to hit it
Cuz I'm blazin up the booth and raisin up the roof
I'm in the vip sippin on Cris' and Henn'
All the ladies is trippin cuz they can't get in
They see me ballin wit the Ruff Ryder homie
And say they only drink liqour nigga but now they want some Jin
Everywhere we kick it we got the club sold
International hustlas that travel the globe
Rockin the thugs makin hoes keep it live
It's the Double R connect and that nigga Twista from Chi
I'm fly

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jin]
We can definately kick it
I don't want to just stick it
If bein fine was a crime well I'd havta write you up a ticket
If you dance for me its sign jus like a picket
And I got two middle fingaz for all you critics
Never you in this someone so clever who spit this
I'm only here for one night so I mix some pleasure with buisness
Every few minutes
I drink a couple of shots
Take a dutch break it in half and fill it up with some pot

[Hook]

Now mama shake some
If they don't like it fuck it
They some haters (c'mon shake it girl)
Yo mama work some
If they don't like it fuck it
They some haters (jus work it girl)

[Hook]

(Jin 2x)
C'mon and shake it girl (like this)
Jus work it girl (like this)
