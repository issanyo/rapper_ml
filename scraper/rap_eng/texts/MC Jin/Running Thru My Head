[Intro]
You know I gotta say something

[Verse 1]
I often sit and ponder, what's the meaning of it all
Is it a conspiracy, am I set up to fall?
They say "you better slow down, you can't walk before you crawl"
I ain't walking, I am runnin', just ran straight into a wall
Multiply by four crossing in no time the star
That's precisely when I transform into a racking ball
Smashing any obstacles laying in my path
Even in depression I still find the way to laugh
I guess that's just a part of me, I mean that's just the heart in me
All up in my blood running through every single artery
Feels like everyone is tryna question my authority
Either I'm bugging, all the whole world is at war with me

[Hook]
And lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru my head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru my head)
Did you even hear a single word that I just said?
(Did you? Did you? Did you even hear me?)
Lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru my head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru my head)
Did you even hear a single word that I just said?
(Did you? Did you? Did you even hear me?)

[Verse 2]
Hiphop is not dead and I am living prove
I'm saving up to build the studio with the living booth
So I could stay in there, killing beats without a care
Only time that I would leave would be to get some fresh air
Check the irony, the father from the booth I leave
Each second actually, makes it harder for me to breathe
Without Hiphop I feel oxygen deprive
Shoot next time you might as well just lock me up inside

[Hook]
Cause lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru my head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru my head)
Did you even hear a single word that I just said?
(Did you? Did you? Did you even hear me?)
Lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru my head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru my head)
Did you even hear a single word that I just said?
(Did you? Did you? Did you even hear me?)

[Verse 3]
Is anybody listening? No am I talkin' to myself?
Talkin' to myself, talkin' to myself
Nobody's listening, guess I'm just talkin' to myself
Talkin' to myself, talkin' to myself
Oh well, I guess it's best, it's just me, myself and I
Split the pot 3 race to prove I ain't no selfish guy
I know you don' think this chance fell from the sky
The devil don't exist? Yeah that's one hell of a lie
If seein' this believin' once you see me in the flesh
One thing I'll guarantee is that you'll see that he's been blessed
I got a couple issues that might need to be a dressed
My mind has been designed and I'll be easily impressed
I wish that you would read between the lines that I express
To see that I am not at all defined by my success
Until then there's no disguise to hype behind the stress
I confess, I'm the one that got myself inside this mess
Everytime I hear the music the feeling is there reputing
And you are welcome to share instead if you care to use it
Everything will be just fine if my beep prepares to lose it
I know you hear the voices, I'm just here to prove it

[Hook]
Cause lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru your head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru your head)
Nobody even heard a single word that you just said
(Did they? Did they? Did they even hear it?)
Cause lately all these thoughts have been runnin' thru your head
(Ru-ru-runnin' thru your head)
Nobody even heard a single word that you just said
(No-no-nobody)
