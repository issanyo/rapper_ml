[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Rewind time to 04, first album about to drop
Label said we need that one single to make things pop
Back in the studio going down so official
With the mind before the takeover and H- to the -izzle
Sitting on the couch like "Am I really here?"
Just the two of us, not even the recording engineer
Was present, "you should check this out", I said "okay"
He hit a button on the MP, a sample started to play
A kid in a candy store, excited and amazed
I said, "yo that's fire", I mean what else would I say?
Knocked the joint out, got it mixed and mastered, this is it
Yeah even dropped the verse for the remix and it was lit
Vinyl pressed, eager for the whole world to hear it
BAD NEWS, Rockefeller won't clear it
Can't lie, at the time felt like a punch in the gut
Just spent a chunk of my budget on a album cut?
It suck

[Chorus]
We talk and we all sound confused (sound confused)
What's the truth, don't get lost in your views (don't get lost in your views)
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes, and I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes
I got two pairs

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
That's right, two pairs to show appreciation
Plus I got a love that's still in heavy rotation
The last time I saw you was a Dialated show
You was the opener, I was in the back row
When Jesus Walks drop, the crowd went berserk
I'm pretty sure, it was the closest thing to church
A lot of folks in the audience have attended
Then you became "Yeezus" and plenty got offended
I think back to that time at the stu' when it was just me and you
I was trying to play it cool
What if I didn't act like a stand
Instead of Kanye the producer, I saw Kanye the man?
Not to say we would end up BFFs
But, you never know though, butterfly effect
Could have ended up on your roster one day
But I'm making good music anyways
Ayy

[Chorus]
We talk and we all sound confused (sound confused)
What's the truth, don't get lost in your views (don't get lost in your views)
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes, and I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes
I got two pairs

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
And both pairs were a gift from my wife
Pirate blacks and the grey moon rocks, yeah they tight
Far from a high piece, that's not who I am
Man makes the kicks, the kicks don't make a man
This song ain't 'bout what's underneath the soles of my feet
I'm writing this to see how many souls I can reach
Is he a genius? Is he crazy? Depends who you asking
Maybe a bit of both, I can't justify his actions
Don't know him personally, but recognize his passion
The College Dropout, losing emotional attachment
Not many things in common, wait, I guess there's one
He's tight with Chance the Rapper, I'm tight with Chance the Son
Don't know what's going on inside the head of Mr. West
Anyone going through some ish, I'm wishing them the best
We all entitled to opinions, don't need you to invest
So pay me no mind, that's two pennies less
God Bless

[Chorus]
We talk and we all sound confused (sound confused)
What's the truth, don't get lost in your views (don't get lost in your views)
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes, and I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes (two pairs, two pairs)
I got two pairs of Yeezes
There's a path that we all gotta choose
Imagine trying to walk in these shoes
I got two pairs

I got two pairs
