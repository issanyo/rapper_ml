[Verse 1]
They say that it’s the root of evil
I guess thats kinda true
Just to get it
Look at all the things that people do
Rob steal kill cheat lie
Sell their soul
In the blink of an eye
Just to see their dollars grow
I don’t know
What about the hard working nine to fivers
Trying to make a honest living day to day
Barely survivin’
Bus drivin’
Kitchen cookin’
Cleanin’
Takin out the trash
Feelin like there
Ain’t no meanin’
But to try and get some cash go to school
Higher learnin’
That’s what they say you need in this society
We all tryin’ to succeed
What does success
Look like
How do you measure
The amount
I mean
Is it solely based on
The balance of your account if thats the case
I’m tryin to break the bank
I see you sittin on dubs what’s up with
That empty tank
To be frank
That’s just not healthy
You trying to get rich
Man I’m tryin to be wealthy

[Chorus]
If it don’t make dollars
Then it don’t make sense
All the paper in the world
And you’ll never be content
Whether falling from the skies or growing on the trees
You serve it like a master got you falling on your knees
Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money

[Verse 2]
It can change your life in a major way
How much did you make today
What about after taxes
What you got saved away
Let you hold somethin’
I thought you just got paid
How you rather be broke
Just to copp some Js
Who am I to criticize
I’ve been down that same path
Spend it faster
Than I make it
No hesitatin’
I paid cash
That was my goal in life
To have the freshest sneakers
But as as I get older
Things get much deeper
Who’s the richest
Not my business
Never check the forbes list
All they ever do
Is tell me you cannot afford this
Money ain’t a thing
Thats the motto
When you ballin’
Money’s everything
When the bill collectors calling
In the end though
It’s not like
You can die with it
Not to mention
All the things that you can’t buy with it
Love peace joy good health these are priceless
Never sell yourself short no matter what the price is

[Chorus]
If it don’t make dollars
Then it don’t make sense
All the paper in the world
And you’ll never be content whether falling from the skies or growing on the trees
You serve it like a master got you falling on your knees Love it, Money
Stack it, Money
Count it, Money
Fold it, Money
Spend it, Money
Want it, Money
Need it, Money
Take it, Money
