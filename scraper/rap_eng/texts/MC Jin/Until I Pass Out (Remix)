[Intro: Uncle Reece]
See I'm go worship until I pass out
See I'm came to worship until I pass out

[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Worship me with your life
That's what Jesus said
And he broke his body just so i can eat
Ya he's my bread
Started on my feet ha
Now I'm on my knees instead
And I'ma bout to lose control
Like Uncle Reece's dreads
Hit by the holy ghost
Blackout like a comatose [?]
See sometimes they take on the pros[?]
Naw not me I overdose
Ain't finish yet worship is my antidote
So I go hard in the paint like Michelangelo

[Pre Hook: Uncle Reece]
So I'm gon' worship until I pass out (there is no other option x2)
See I'm gon' worship until I pass out (there is no other option)
Cause we go

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Hard in the paint, hard in the paint, we go hard in the paint when we worship (4x)

[Verse 2: Reconcile]
I ain't cut for God
We ain't grown up in the church
I watch my family
Till the day I see the earth
To pride loss soul still running
Feel God wasn't for me
These thieves taking everything from me
Into the world somehow I blew it all
When you realize you're dying to see who
Killed your cost
I barely made it due
But I care so much in Christ now
Worship with my life now
Welcome to the lifestyle

[Verse 3: BrvndonP]
Lord I worship you
When I pass out
When the Devil come man I zone out
You the King of kings
And the Lord of lords
You my God
Uh man I can't worry 'bout what
Other people say, they didn't die for me
And I just wanna match my words
To put some good
To set me free
You make me whole, make me new
You clean my
Soul I lift my hands
And cry out to you cause I want
To go higher and deeper
So I

So I'm gon' worship until I pass out (there is no other option x2)
See I'm gon' worship until I pass out (there is no other option)
Cause we go

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Hard in the paint, hard in the paint, we go hard in the paint when we worship (4x)

[Verse 4: Eshon Burgundy]
I'm tryna worship till I'm all the way exhausted
What else can I do but turn his booth into a pauper
They say I got the juice I got juice will let me
Pavet like perfume upon the feet of those who preach
Now ain't that gorgeous Lord you so unique
I'm feeling weak I'm feeling noxious
Refuse to take defeat you let me creep into your fortress
Shower by your love drink the water from your facet
Now all of the above is what you do for every orphan
The rose grew from the concrete
Oh behold ark that pushed up like a palm tree
Calm leaf in the dark streets
Sharp teeth and hard speech
I've been through hell so pardon me
If you do let's show let's start off neat
But praise God on the streets[?]
Let's worship

[Bridge: Uncle Reece]
So I came to worship until I pass out (there is no other option)
Did you come here to worship until you pass out (there is no other option)
Brothers and sisters gon' worship until you pass out (there is no other
Option)
Brothers and sisters worship until you pass out (there is no other option)

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
'Cause we go
Hard in the paint, hard in the paint, we go hard in the paint when we worship (4x)
