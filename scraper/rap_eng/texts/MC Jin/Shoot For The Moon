[Hook X2:]
Make sure you shoot for the moon (Make sure you shoot for the moon)
So you can land on the stars (So you can land on the stars)

And they gon' know who you are (And they gon' know who you are)
And they gon' know who you are (And they gon' know who you are)

[Verse 1:]
Listen up boys and girls once upon a time
Lived a Chinese kid they told him he couldn't rhyme
There was only one thing that was steady on his mind
That's to try and get signed so he got heavy on his grind
Sharpened up his skills machete'd every line
Put 110% into it everytime
Made it to the finals but never obtained a ring
If he could go back he wouldn't change a thing
Seen the ups and downs not nervous don't regret it
Cause when you're flying high turbulence is expected
Why continue? only he knows the real reason
10 years in the game and guess what he's still breathin'
You may think otherwise some say he's a success
Either way he just knows overall that he's been blessed
Who's the Chinese kid you already might have guessed
They say you live and you learn time to put it to the test

[Verse 2:]
I know you got dreams that you been chasing for a long time
You been waiting but it starts to feel like such a long line
Before you know it it becomes a love hate relationship
Only just a few things that you can be so patient with "
I can relate to it all I gotta say is have faith with it
Before homeplate you gotta hit first base with it
An opportunity is only what you make of it
Your birthday only comes once a year so have your cake with it
Other than that don't try to steal an extra slice
It ain't a million bucks but I offer you this advice
Don't ever take a handout why would you when you can stand out
If you can t build a sand castle start with a sand house
Work your way up from the bottom to the top
You'll never get there only if you stop
All I'm tryin to do now is give them
Somethin' they can feel
Malik said it best "they can't deny it when it's real"
