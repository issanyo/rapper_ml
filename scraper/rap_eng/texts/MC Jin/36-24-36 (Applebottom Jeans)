[Intro:]
You Know... When It Comes To The Ladies...
I Think About What My Man Fife Dog Said...
Uh Huh...You Remember...
I Like Em Brown, Yellow, Puerto Rican Or Asian...

[Hook: x2]
Here's something that I bet you never seen (What's that?)
Asian girl in some Applebottom Jeans (Ok)
36 Uh 24 Uh 36 Uh, Baby Let's Go Uh
See Her From The Back N Be Like She Blazing
Think She Black, Turn Around Found Out She Asian
So Amazin What An Odd Occasion
I'mma Tell you This For your Information
I Like Em Brown, Black, Even Caucasian
But This One Got Me Standin Here Dazin
So Sick, Think I Need My Medication
This Is Not A Song, It's A Dedication
For My Nation, A Celebration
Its A Party you don't Need An Invitation
But Back To Whats In Front Of My Facing
Good God What A Beautiful Creation
I Don't Give A Damn What's your Reputation
You Independent And you Got An Occupation
I'mma Take you To the Club From the Basement
Then I Might Hit Up The Radio Station

[Hook x2]

I Got This Chinese Broad That Stays Out In The Bay
Leave Comments On My Myspace Every Single Day
Got A Korean Chick Who Stays Down In Texas
When Im In Town, Scoop Me Up In A Lexus
A Japanese Joint In Miami On The Low
She Said She Got A Man But He Out In Tokyo
My Viet Chick Got More Than Good Looks So U Know
I Ask Her Can She Cook and She Said Fo Sho
Got A 20 Year Old That Still Watches Nickalodeon
I Think She Half Thai And Half Cambodian
A Weed Head That Likes To Puff On A Killer Of Green
From The Phillipines, Love The Way She Fill Her Jeans
Asked This One Shorty If We Could Chat
She Told Me She Was Laos
And I Asked Wheres That?
Then She Proceeded To Show Me On The Map
I Said Thats Where We Goin Cuz Baby Thats Where Its At

[Hook x2]

What's That?! There She Go, Ok [x4]
Whats That? Ok [x8] (36, 24,36)

[Hook x2]
