[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Lord it's a blessing just to be able to praise You
You've given me so much there's no way I can repay You
When I think about Your love it's hard not to be consumed
You knew me before I was formed inside my mother's womb
Under Your supervision I was wonderfully made
The thought of it is mind blowing it's no wonder I'm amazed
I was created in Your image that's humbling just to say
You put me on this earth and know the number of my days
When it comes time for judgement the moment that I meet You
I only hope You'll recognize Your child when I greet You
I've been thinking 'bout it and I'm done with contemplatin'
The world is fading away so there's no time for waitin'
For that moment that I feel like it's finally right
I've been searching for joy only to find it in Christ
Yeah it changed my life when I made the revelation
That I am the masterpiece out of all of Your creations

[Hook: Kei Kei]
Broken
Look at my flaws and all
So many times I fall
Never out the potter's hand
God I don't understand
Me wonderfully made
Really me You died to gain
Not perfect but You love me
Cause You are my master
And I am your masterpiece
Ooh I am Your masterpiece
Cause You are my master
And I am Your masterpiece

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
Sittin' in the dark it'd be hard for me to write this
You said let there be light and filled the world with brightness
The plan in the beginning was for us to be as one
It was fine until man did what couldn't be undone
What's good and what's evil can all change in an instance
Once upon a time we didn't even know the difference
The Lord gave us free will that was part of His decision
We can only blame ourselves for what started the division
Ever since then man and God have been divided
Through the Way the Truth and the Life shall we be reunited
You allowed Your only son to die just so I could live
My life was up for auction You put up the highest bid
Only after seeking You now I understand this
A painting with no artist is just an empty canvas
I am Your masterpiece now I understand this
Cause without You I'd be just an empty canvas

[Hook: Kei Kei]
Broken
Look at my flaws and all
So many times I fall
Never out the potter's hand
God I don't understand
Me wonderfully made
Really me You died to gain
Not perfect but You love me
Cause You are my master
And I am your masterpiece
Ooh I am Your masterpiece
Cause You are my master
And I am Your masterpiece

[Outro: MC Jin & Kei Kei]
Lord You are our creator
We were wonderfully made
And even though we are broken
We are Your masterpieces
By Your amazing grace

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

Broken
Look at my flaws and all
So many times I fall
Never out the potter's hand
God I don't understand
Me wonderfully made
Really me You died to gain
Not perfect but You love me
Cause You are my master
And I am your masterpiece

Ooh
I am Your masterpiece

Cause You are my master
And I am Your masterpiece
