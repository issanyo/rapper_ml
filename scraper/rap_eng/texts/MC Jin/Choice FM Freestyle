[Verse 1]
Check it
Jin is the equivalent
Of the hip hop savior
It's a courtesy freestyle
For Friday night flavors
Ever since I was independent I wanted major
Well now that I'm major
I kinda want to go backwards
Cause the rap game is filled with nothing but actors
Trying to take me out, break my back like chiropractors
It's okay
Although I felt so neglected
I still was on my grind just to get some respect, kid
Check it
Ayo, the mic's when I wreck it
I guarantee I'll rip you in less than 60 seconds
Regardless if it's BET or live from Puerto Rico
Oh, can't forget I've gotta shout out all my people
When I look to the sky
I see them pearly gates
It's not if you from UK
Or represent the States
Hip-hop is hip-hop whether you rock kicks or flip-flops
Just make sure your rhymes are tip-top shape
In form
You think that I'm hot but I'm just warm
Cause when I elevate my temperature you know it's on
