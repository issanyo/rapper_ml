Go go go Obama Obama (Oh!)

Chorus
I don't know politics, that's no joke
But I do know that I get one vote
You wanna make chnage then you gotta take note
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Yo, yo,Dear Obama, Comma
First off this is truly an honor.I'm a supporter
I wannted to say how strongly I believe in your bipatisan ways
Red state, Blue state, That's kinda late
In your e1, it's only the United States
Your campaigne in 04 made an impact.Alone you opposed to war in Iraq
The other candidates can't lie.You still won the Senate by the landlide
Critics said we can't stand, Then you stood on the podium and told 'em said "Yes we can"
Now after the world is watching him after the Jack Ambramoff scandal. He vowed to clean up Washington
But he's out to do far more, as far as war.He's tryin' to stop genocide in Darfour
Who's better than, he's honest and never been hestitant
When it's time to honor veterians, as far as voting, he scrutinized the law
Just so nobody disenfranchises the poor
Chorus
I don't know politics, that's no joke
But I do know that I get one vote
You wanna make chnage then you gotta take note
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
We wanna live in a country with wealthfare reform
When healthcare for uninsured children is norm
Tougher ethics laws for those out to hurt us
Tax relief for low income workers
Rest in peace, Sean . These days are so violent
We need a statewide ban on racial profilin
Gasprices are outlandish.Might I suggust higher fuel efficiency standards
Terrorist treats got the whole world scared
And type of disaster , we must be prepared
Listen up the fact is real: Christians, Buddists and Muslims on Capitol Hill
Instead of separate State from the church
First you have to figure out what your faith is worth
Religion is what you envision.Don't need to be off limit as long as it's off limit
Soldiers happend to a liar. You know, politicians all in rhythm, when they clap into choir
Whether Allen Keys tends to agree or not, I thank God son is votin' for Barack
Go go go Obama Obama (Oh!)
Go go go Obama Obama (Oh!)
Chorus
I don't know politics, that's no joke
But I do know that I get one vote
You wanna make chnage then you gotta take note
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Dear Obama, Ima, Cynic. I admit World's got my patient limit for these gimmick
No matter what they spin it, it only takes a minute
Before I get lost and turn the TV off, But you came through speaking to the way I felt
Plus the way you dealt with the critics, I was with it
The only Candidate fanning the flame of hope
And I know they can't camera who didn't pan into folks
You got my vote speaking out your word.Preaching out the coalitions you built
The issues that you teach about Kansas to Kenya, Selma to Chicago
Calling us to lead,not just follow and nothing rings hollow
You've been through hard times.Truth is why people put their faith in you
And I speaking from my heart, I hope that you're listenin
No one else has been in the position that you're sitting in
Poised to make history, Rebuild trust
It's time to heal the wounds that defy all of us
I'm callin' all my people that are sitting up straight Barack Obama in 08
Chorus
I don't know politics, that's no joke
But I do know that I get one vote
You wanna make chnage then you gotta take note
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
Whatcha gonna do huh?(Take it to the Polls)
