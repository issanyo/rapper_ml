[Verse 1: MC Jin]
My goal was to get signed
My goal was to blow up
Guess what, when it happened, I ain’t even know what, hit me
Am I leanin’, Somebody pinch me, Am I dreamin’
Chain on my neck, my name on a check, life finally had some meaning
At least that’s what it felt like, felt right from the start, But little did I know I was slowly fallin’ apart
My goals were short term, drop hits, get hot today, I jus’ need a hit with Timbaland, Neptunes, maybe Dr. Dre
Neglectin’ my craft, I could care less about the art, All I’m tryin’ to do is to find the fastest path to get on the charts
Wasn’t always like this, is it the cash that did the damage?
Once upon a time there was a passion it was organic
Nights like this, I’m feelin’ like Eddie Kane
Missin’ my heartbeat, wasn’t ready for the fame
There’s power in his name, yeah His grace is sufficient
My only goal now is run this race until I’m finished, I’m in this

[Hook: D. Tropp]
The bright lights will turn you to a monster, at least that’s what they say
Is it worth what it’ll cost ya? When it’s thrown all away…
So what good is it to gain the world, gain the world, but not gain a thing
What good is it to gain the world and lose everything

[Verse 2: Gemstones]
My goal was a big chain
My goal was a slick range
My goal was a big house
Me and Lupe flyin’ jet planes
Some young girl getting’ stretched out
Every night drunk on champagne
Nose up with my chest out
Lord knows how them checks came
Stunt so hard, you flexed out
Sure enough, felt like X-games
Eyelids get no rest how
It’s no sleep when you in that left lane
And I kept sane
Made it out just before death came
Blessed I was almost X’d out
And would’a been had I missed that next train
Home but I still felt left out
Thought a new life would’a brought less strain
Was on Lupe’s cool tour stressed out
And thought sunshine would have brought less rain
If only somehow I had less doubt
If only someway I felt less pain
Depression on you to best out
Still broke cause you got less fame
Coulda been rich with a  guest house
But something within my chest changed
I ain’t get dropped
I backed out
I’m done, y'all can have this rap game
Sold my soul for a packed house
A few g’s and a lil’ scrap change
I’m runnin’ back Lord both arms stretched out
Forever I’ll praise Your blessed name

[Hook: D. Tropp]
The bright lights will turn you to a monster, at least that’s what they say
Is it worth what it’ll cost ya? When it’s thrown all away…
So what good is it to gain the world, gain the world, but not gain a thing
What good is it to gain the world and lose everything

[Verse 3: Mogli The Iceburg]
My goal was that prestige
My goal was to impress these
Critics and peers so I could make a little money
Maybe get enough to buy a couple car keys
My goal was that rapper fame
My goal was that big name with my big head and my soul dead
Til’ that light shown
And my heart changed
And that’s real
Listen, sit back and smile
Put a deal on the table
Ready to sign, I was willing and able
Til’ I had a talk with the head of the label
He said, don’t talk about God that don’t make money
That’ll cost money, that’ll take from me
Don’t you wanna blow, don’t you wanna know, What its like to be up at the top
Just sign on the dot, Huh? Started from the bottom now we in it till we win it
Only difference is the way that we gon’ finish
See the elevator goin’ up for anybody
Walkin’ with the Spirit
I just hope the people clear enough to hear it
So I give it to them with the lyricism
Cause the mission here is different
We just doin’ it to glorify His image
Not our own
Not because I fear Hell but because I love Him
And I wanna be up with Him when he sittin on His throne
So I’m sayin’, give me the rain, give me the pain, unashamed in the game
Boy the worst you could do is kill me
Goin' and puttin’ it down with the sound that resounds in the town
My identity in Him, that’s the real me
Yes Lord, it might have taken me a minute
But I’m, done with all that talkin’, Here on out I’m tryna live it
Indie
