It's how I gotta live my life
It's how I gotta live my life

[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Peace of mind is a dream that we can all chase
Until we're stuck between that rock and a hard place
Heart racin' anticipatin' God's grace
Firm belief He's in control that's what you call faith
Instead of walkin' by sight it don't take much to see
He's by your side He'll provide exactly what you need
Yes indeed all you gota do is just believe
Grab a shovel dig a hole and plant your mustard seed
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it (believe it so we speak it)
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it

[Hook: Joey Jewish]
It's how I gota live my life
Walking by faith
Though I don't see it know You got it on the way
Hit my knees
Humbly I pray
This is what I hear the Lord say
Plant, water, grow
Plant, water, grow
Plant, water, grow
Faith is so ridiculous
I believe in believin' in the Lord

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
The King has resurrected even though He did die
In order to be righteous faith is what I live by
With God all is possible how could you think not
My faith is so ridiculous I'm David with a slingshot
Conquerin' my giants His presence is so glorious
Always stand firm that's what the moral of the story is
Let the Lord take control get use to the unusual
The lame shall walk again the blind can see it's beautiful
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it (believe it so we speak it)
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it

[Hook: Joey Jewish]
It's how I gotta live my life
Walking by faith
Though I don't see it know You got it on the way
Hit my knees
Humbly I pray
This is what I hear the Lord say
Plant, water, grow
Plant, water, grow
Plant, water, grow
Faith is so ridiculous
I believe in believin' in the Lord

I know that You will always come through
As long as I'm believing in You

You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it (believe it so we speak it)
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it

It's how I gota live my life
Walking by faith
Though I don't see it know You got it on the way
Hit my knees
Humbly I pray
This is what I hear the Lord say
Plant water grow
Plant water grow
Plant water grow
Faith is so ridiculous
I believe in believin' in the Lord

I'm believing in You Lord

You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it (believe it so we speak it)
You shall find it if you seek it (find it if you seek it)
We believe it so we speak it

I'm believing in You Lord
Jesus
You're the One
I put my faith in
