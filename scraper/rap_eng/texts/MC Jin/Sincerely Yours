[Intro]
Yo
Sincerely Yours 2.0
What else can I say?
AMEN!

[Hook]
I'm back on my grind
Can't help but feel it's different in the back of my mind  (my mind)
This time it's a fact that'll you find
All I do is for you that's right I'm
Sincerely yours (come on come on)
Sincerely yours (say what say what)
Sincerely yours
Sincerely sincerely

[Verse 1]
Time and time again I ask the same question
Who am I? no doubt it got my brain stressin'
Even better than myself You know me well
And without my soul I'd be just an empty shell
So I take that back actually You know me best
I'm just tryin' to live my life with no regrets
The reality is I'm not the rightful owner
This life ain't even mine this body's just a loaner
At first I was lost blame it on confusion '
Til' I stood at the cross and came to the conclusion
Two options I can choose to be a fool
Or surrender my all and let You use me a tool

[Hook]
I'm back on my grind
Can't help but feel it's different in the back of my mind  (my mind)
This time it's a fact that'll you find
All I do is for you that's right I'm
Sincerely yours (come on come on)
Sincerely yours (say what say what)
Sincerely yours
Sincerely sincerely

[Verse 2]
See verse two is dedicated to a special woman
Who told me I could even when I felt I couldn't
I can see your face when my eyes are closed
You were there for me thru the highs and lows
From the moment we set sail it never was calm
No matter how rough it got you weathered the storm
That's just not your style to abandon the ship
You just wouldn't allow it if I'm plannin' to quit
I was struck by despair no doubt I was hit
Just my luck you were there pulled me out of the pit
You the truth no convincin' needed I been sold
Now watch me give this love back to you tenfold

[Hook]
I'm back on my grind
Can't help but feel it's different in the back of my mind  (my mind)
This time it's a fact that'll you find
All I do is for you that's right I'm
Sincerely yours (come on come on)
Sincerely yours (say what say what)
Sincerely yours
Sincerely sincerely

[Verse 3]
To the listeners your patience is so legit
I know that ya'll been anticipatin' for me to spit
Sorry I kept yall waitin' ya'll held me down that's deep
The ones I met before to the ones I'm bound to meet
The #nofanzone that's who this song is goin' out to
Ya'll are fam so how can I forget about you
Don't care what others do I ain't here to top that
What I'm tryin' to do is give you more than just a hot track
This is food for your soul I make it delicious
Comin' straight off the stove I'll even do the dishes
I wreckon it's just me and you nobody else
So if you want seconds feel free to help yourself     I'm back on my grind
Can't help but feel it's different in the back of my mind  (my mind)
This time it's a fact that'll you find
All I do is for you that's right I'm
Sincerely yours (come on come on)
Sincerely yours (say what say what)
Sincerely yours
Sincerely sincerely
