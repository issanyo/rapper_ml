I used to sit on your shoulders
Felt like i had a view of the whole globe right below us
I was young but still old enough to know
That my daddy was'nt rich but you had a heart of gold
These childhood memories are priceless
Far from perfect , you know how life gets
When did it all start to go downhill
When i realise that this passion i had found is real
You claim it was the worst decision i could ever make
To not chase it was a risk i could never take
Safe to say as i got closer to my dreams
The bond between us was just tearing at the seams
And so it seems the war is finally over
I'm older , but still that little boy thats on your shoulders
Loving me is all you've ever done
All i hear now are the words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Run a little faster
Stand a little taller
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Fight a little harder
Fly a little higher
I'll be there for you
Like a rock in a middle of a raging river

Sometimes you sit on my shoulders
And its a perfect view , of a whole globe right below us
So much to say yet words can't truly describe
How i felt inside the second that you arrived
A little bit of fear, a whole lot of joy
It still hasn't sunk in, man i got a boy!!
Can't even lie , im concerned in every way
I guess all i could do is learn everyday
To me and mommy you're our number 1
I often wonder what type of man you will become
You'll do great things , and that im confident
Always stay humble amidst the compliments
As for the ladies , save for the wedding ring
Always put god above everything
As long as im alive my job is never done
These are just a words of a father to a son

(chorus)

Maybe ya listening and ya contemplating
Cos its been awhile since yall had a conversation
A simple call, time to man up
Before you hit that last digit, quick to hang up
Feels like there's no way it can be done
Picking up the phone and it weighs about a ton
But , still not as heavy as your heart
Tryna make amends not sure when you should start
Even if you talk , what do you say , its a scary thought
Dont let pride get in the way , what a shame
Shared the last name yet you're strangers
No pain remains forever love can change it ( changes )
Need someone to lift you up when you fall down
Seperated , hesitate to tear the walls down
Forgiveness can heal when its all said and done
That goes for both a father and a son

(chorus)

So steady as we go
Yes there's always room to grow
All love will be a rock in the middle of a raging river
