[Skit]
[Teacher] All right students, class dismissed
[Children] Hey chef
[Chef] Hello children
[Children] So what's today's lunch special
[Chef] The same as it is every day
[Children] What, what is it?
[Chef] Country fried stake, followed by my chocolate salty balls
[Children] Ahw, nuts!

[Intro: Jin]
We stuck in this cafeteria they call the industry
Serving up the same damn thing
I bet you thought it would never happen, huh?

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again

[Verse 1: Jin]
The industry has got me fucked up
In the stomach where my ribs meat
Starving while I watch all of these other kids eat
I heard your signing bonus was a Lexus coup
I'm next in line, yeah Imma fight for the extra scoop
A natural entrepeneur, I was born on the job
Trade you half a biscuit for your corn in a cup
Most of y'all, they brag about keeping the heat close
I don't got beef, that's just yesterday's meat loaf
Damn, how can I put this delicately
Y'all is some leftovers like fronting like a delicacy
If they won't let me eat I will act on my own hunch
Forced once and for all yo to pack my own lunch

[Verse 2: Kev Nish]
This record be serving kids mystery meats
Same damn CD, week after week
With no nutrition nor ambition
The burger's getting hard and the jello's gibbling
The things that you cover with your government cheese
The kids that you're filling with your industry grease
If the cooks care less and cease or perish
Left out for days like peas and carrots
Peace from the far east now on your menu
Four foot boobs and your essential
Endent your regiment with the vitamin Jin
Put a spork in your mouth with a bite of FM

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
I'll be waiting in line
Rubbing my stomach 'cause I'm starving
Wasting my time, 'cause the cook is serving garbage
Plate full of empty getting dizzy like I'm carsick
Hunger pain made my brain take the kitchen hostage
Teachers never honest, keep 'em from the knowledge
Meals artificial, recipes filled with nonsense
Alarming the way they turn their face y'all
But I promise the staff won't eat this cold [?]
Shit is crazy more like boys' bathroom stalls
Better guard your plate 'cause I got a sticky paw
'Fore your fried chicken omelet and meals on the daily
[?]

[Verse 4: Prohgress]
I get the special of the day, goddamn I'm furious
I'm like John McEnroe, You cannot be serious
Changing up the menu and we're doing it right
So I'm throwing up my lunch to incite a food fight
Jug over the counter to catch the lunch later
Try not to attack with mashed potatoes and gravy
We ain't saving nothing here, we hailing a new year
So here comes the brand new flavor for your ear
Chilling FM the nuisence like Rayquan
Serving y'all food for thought fun with asians
Keep your hands high like you wanting some mo'
But this is where it ends, cafeteria closed

[Hook: Jin]
You are now tunes into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
You swaping hot outta rock greater spots
Since the days of fish sticks and tater tots
Four MCs with cocky flows
All you other rappers sounding like Sloppy Joes
You are now tuned into FM and Jin
We ain't never eating at the cafeteria again
