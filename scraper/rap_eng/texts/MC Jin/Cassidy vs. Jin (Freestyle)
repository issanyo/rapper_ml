[Cassidy]
You niggas is chick-made
I'm quick with my fist and a switch blade
Get brave, you will get a clip in your rib cage
That's what'll happen you act dumb
Silencers on the gat
It sound like I'm clappin a cap gun
I'm from where they dump heat
Dudes that want beef get smacked with the tool
Remove all of they front teeth
Man, once they send me all those shoot
You gonna take more shots than a photo shoot camera
Get led from the hammer, Put the toast to your head
You would have a stroke like Fred Sanford
It ain't difficult the pistol cripple you
The sig clap push your wig back like Mystikal's
Man, most of the, where my Burners at
One chrome and one burner black like Bernie Mac
And I'll body him and his female
I'll put a shell in her head like a bobbypin
Yeah, I'm puttin' rock on the stroll
A baller push rock and push cock in these hoes
And it's sweet to get a freak on my nuts
I got the smile when the crocodile seats in the truck
You mad cause you ain't eatin' enough cause your boss rippin' you off
Like the leaf on the dutch
You a nut, you oughta Earn your respect
You gettin robbed
Get a job, nigga earn you a check
You ain't fit for the grind
I don't nickel and dime
The strip get mine a brick at a time
The shit I spit in my rhyme shit I say in a conversation
Cats kinda on my pipe, but they kinda hatin'
One minute I'm hot, one minute I'm wack
But I finish a rap
And fifteen minutes of that
I hit the sixteen before Swizz finished the track
Make some noise, the boy from big business is back
I got that put it in your nose and sniff it
My record's like the directions to the road to riches
I knock down your door like Jehova Witness
And bring niggas in your crib like your older sisters
You can't hold your liquor, stop drinkin'
Cause you not thinkin'
But watch you sober up when that shot's stinging
And the box stinkin murder for hire
Spread your herb ass on the grass like fertilizer
I heard your album ain't get nowhere
What happened
I'm going Platinum like Sisqo hair
This so scary

[Jin]
Gotta have it for burnin' the mic
You heard that I'm nice
I spit the most absurd ish you ever heard in your life
Here's some words of advice that you should listen to
If you get offended, guess what
We're probably dissin' you
Are these cats for real
I'm the least bit impressed kid
They need to pass a bill
Have these wack MC's arrested
I've been blessed with a flow, spittin ever since
Some say I'm conceited, naw I'm just convinced
I ain't tryin to be a hater
Just say What I think
But I've seen better punchlines at the prom waitin' for drinks
Yo, I spit flames, leave you chokin' in hell
Me losin' battles
Picture Bow Wow smoking an L
Look at your wrists all limp, son I know that you frail
Probably drop the soap on purpose when you're going to jail
I'm on fire, so you know we're smoking more than blunts
And this ain't chicken pox
You can catch it more than once
Fake thugs talk about guns, get they stutter on
The only kind of toast they pack is the kind you put butter on
I see through they image like lingerie
They try to see tomorrow
But they'll be gone today
We're two different characters
Don't make me bust in your mouth
I'm god from Ios
You Marion from In The House
