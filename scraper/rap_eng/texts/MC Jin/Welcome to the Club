[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh

[Verse 1]
I been doin this for so long
Started out with just a dream
Something told me hold on
We gon make it to the top
Felt the world was sleepin on me
But I never stopped now they wakin’ up to smell the coffee
And it cost me
Whole lotta blood sweat and tears
Just tellin my own story
I call it the Wonder Years
Now I got it figured out and its never been the same
Uh uh
Bring on the money and the fame
That ain’t my motivation nah I’m quite the simple guy
But if I said I didn’t care about it that would be a lie
Maybe I don’t fit in
Who am I kiddin
Been waitin' my whole life just to get in

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me
Your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Verse 2]
Wait a minute look how far I came
From watching on the sidelines
I’m finally in the game
Now the pressures on but how can I complain
Ain’t this what I wanted tell me
Are you entertained
Cause when I had the crown you were claiming that you love me
Turn around and put me down
Now you thinking nothing of me
Okay thats cool
God bless you, Amen
I'd rather have genuine haters
Than a bunch of fake friends
So pardon me if I choose not to be around ya’ll
Just when things are looking up
You hoping for my downfall?
15 minutes, and it’s going by quick
I know you counting down the seconds like (tick tick tick)

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere

[Teesa's Verse]
Yeah you do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you
But the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you
Yeah you do what it takes for the fame
To rush up to you
But the clock ticks away
And the game is left up to you

[Chorus]
Welcome to the club ohhhh
Your minute is up ohhhh
Welcome to the club ohhhh
I know you see me
I know you see me your minute is up ohhhh
And I ain’t goin nowhere welcome to the club and I ain’t goin nowhere I know you see me
And I ain’t goin nowhere
