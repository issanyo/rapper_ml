[Intro]
This goes out to all my DSL users, cable modems
No 56k's, ya'll heard?

[Hook]
I download music
I don't buy music
No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been in the record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it
I download music
I don't buy music
No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been to a record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it

Last time I bought a CD was in 89'
Aight, I'm lyin'
But, yo, it's been a long time
Nowadays, I just go online
See what I like, right ‘click‘, and that song's mine
It ain't the fact I wanna see the artist cryin‘
There is just not even coming out worth buying
If I hear a song on the radio, that I like
I make sure I log on later in the night
Limewire, bearshare, maybe kazaa
I type it in and click search and “haha!
There you are!”
Ain't no escaping, if you try
Cuz' my modem is quicker than a blink of an eye
Illegal downloadin' is a criminal offense
Ain't saying I do it
I just say that's how it went
Rappers swear their shit is hot
But I won't spend a cent
You ain't getting my twelve dollars until I'm fully convinced

No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been in the record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it
I download music
I don't buy music
No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been to a record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it

My iTunes account, shit, I never use it
I just use my iTunes to store all of my music
Remember before the internet was here
Before CD's when cassettes was all you hear
Had to switch from A side to B side
Now all you gotta do is your MP3's ride
But it's not just the computer nerds doin it
Leaving it up to bootleggers to ruin it
I use to love the feelin‘
Rushing to the store
Picking up a CD that no body heard before
To all you rappers your hard work is through
The Chinaman, The Africans is got your art work too
Killing any anticipation you might of built
Listen clown, mess around and you might get killed
I bet you, you believe I'm hot
When I a get album number of the month, months before my album even dropped

[Hook]
I download music
I don't buy music
No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been in the record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it
I download music
I don't buy music
No way jose, unless it's my music
I ain't been to a record store in a minute
My ipod got like a million songs in it

See, I ain't trying to be labeled as a thief
I'm just picky with my music, plus I'm kinda cheap
Don't worry about what I do on my first week
I just listen to the rhymes and appreciate the beats
I'm trying to have a smash from the net to the streets
Without snapping my fingers or stomping my feet
That stuff is great, but I'm just not able
To do the same thing I'm trying to bring something different to the table
Last week my PC damn near exploded
Cuz from some bullshit I accidentally I downloaded
I'm not hating
I just don't like trash, damn it
And if yourself is trash, that's exactly where I drag it
Right in the trash bin
Cuz you are a ‘has been'
Delete you off from my hard drive. “Hey, that's Jin”
Next time you see me on MTV
Shout out to my homeboy, “waddup MP3!”
