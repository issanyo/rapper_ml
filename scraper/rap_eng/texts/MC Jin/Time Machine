[Intro]
What if, you knew then what you know now?
Or what if you know now, what you wish you knew then?
That's what I ask you
Lets go

[Verse 1: Jin]
A wise man once told me life is what you make it
Bare witness to the lies simply cause' the truth is naked
My thoughts are sacred yet I share em' with the masses
I intend to be around when the barrier collapses
It's dust to dust and ashes to ashes
Those that come up quick tend to be falling the fastest
On the cash-route, but for the paper they get lost
Not I, I rather let nature take it's course
The reality is harsh but it's gotta be accepted
Your fate has been determined, outcome is pre-selected
No telling when your breath's stoppin', and death's knockin
To enjoy every second is your best option
Treat every first time like if it's your last
I wish I could somehow go and revisit the past
Correct any mistakes, maybe right a few wrongs
I'd hit the studio just to write a few songs

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And Why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And Why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Verse 2: Jin]
For the sake of argument let's say I did find a way
And was capable of going back to any time or day
Like September eleven, then I'd have the chance to
Beg and plead until every last flight was canceled
Go further back to clean more than smoke
Warn 'em to keep a close eye on the floor of the votes
I'd tell martin and Malcolm how I respect they passion
To see change in justice, watch for the assassins
And meeting Bruce would be history itself
Maybe study Martial Arts with Mr. Lee himself
I'd tell Biggie to run the lights, don't stop, son
And Pac, somethin' ain't right, don't ride shotgun
The good die young, we all know, but how come?
And since we know why we can't change the outcome
I try to make a difference, but reality remains
That the script's been written, so my efforts are in vain

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Verse 3: Jin]
What about my future and the road that lies ahead
Should I take a glimpse or be surprised instead?
Think I'll sneak-a-peak, I see a road full of plex
No more gimmicks, critics say I'm more skilled, in fact
Hate to say I told you so, but honestly speaking
Finally got the respect I'm constantly seeking
After the acclaim think I'll settle down
One wife, two kids, I'm out the ghetto now
I'm lying to myself, my life's a complete waste
A bitter-sweet sorrow, that's just how defeat taste's
I has been forgotten, I'm yesterday's news
No longer relevant, Jin was expected to loose
Can't see that is my destiny so I'm lookin' past
My twenty-twenty vision blurred  through the lookin' glass
At last I choose to walk a path of my own
I've come this far but the other half is unknown

[Chorus]
If I had a time machine I'd go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
Andwhy not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow

[Chorus]
Jump in my time machine and go back in a flash
Tell myself "you ain't nothing but a thing of the past"
So let's go, ain't got time for none of ya'll to borrow
And why not? Cause' today is yesterday's tomorrow
