[Verse 1]
I’d like to take this moment
To tell y’all how I came up
But first let me tell y’all
Where I came from
In North Miami Beach
Born and raised
On the grind is
How I spent most of my days
Chillin’ out
Maxin’ relaxin’ coolin’
Kickin’ freestyles
Outside of my school and
Before LL was in the house
I picked up the mic
Mama almost knocked me out
Not a new jack
You ain’t get the memo wait
98 I was on my third demotape
No YouTube views
No Instagram
Had to hit that stage to
Convince the fans
Won’t lie got booed
Maybe once or twice
Never again
I must’ve been doin’
Somethin’ right
Could it be my desire
Hunger Games
I’m a one of one
You will find none the same
With skills required like you have never seen
I got that fire
Katniss Everdeen
See the goal was to get signed
Show up in headlines
Labels slept for awhile
Bedtime
Til I hit ‘em with that
Wake up call
911 emergency
Wake up y’all
Plan A don’t stop till they know my name
Plan B was simple
See Plan A
Gotta stay focused
To overcome what’s tough
That’s just how it is when you’re comin’ up

[Chorus]
I know you see me
Comin’ up
I know you see me
Comin’ up
That’s what’s up

[Verse 2]
I’m a father now
I love story time
Ready for it?
Here’s a Toy Story line
They say where you been Jin
I been right here
Just buildin’ up my buzz for a light year
Startin’ from scratch
Somethin’ fresh indeed
Cookin’ up tracks
Got a new recipe
A little bit of this and a little of that
Let it sit in the booth for 30 minutes
And it’s a wrap
The delivery is flawless
When I spit it that’s a fact
If it isn’t permission granted feel free to send it back
Shout out to Twista
A vet fasho
We did a song together and never met before
Sometimes that’s just
How the game goes
No pot of gold
At the end of rainbows
Pockets not quite
At the proper calorie yet
My biggest payout
Cashing a reality check
But the last thing I’m doin’ though
Is prayin’ for wealth
Cause I love the Lord way before anything else
In the meantime yo
I got business to do
‘bout to kill it
All that’s left is my finishin’ move
Stayin’ composed
While I’m still in control
Tryin’ to sellout these shows
Without sellin’ my soul
I seen the highs and the lows
Just to sum it up
That’s always how it is
When you’re comin’ up

[Chorus]
I know you see me
Comin’ up
I know you see me
Comin’ up
That’s what’s up

[Ending]
Ahh yeaah
Here’s the best part
The come up
Gotta enjoy it
Check me out yo
I’m comin’ up
Nah I ain’t lookin’ down
I’m comin’ up
Nah I ain’t lookin’ down
At this rate
I won’t even see the ground
At this rate
I won’t even see the ground
Change the game
Thats what I came to do
Change the game
That’s what I came to do
Change the game
Don’t let it change you
Change the game
Don’t let it change
Change, change
You, you, you
