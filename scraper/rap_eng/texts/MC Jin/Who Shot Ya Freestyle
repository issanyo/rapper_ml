[Verse 1]
They say you only get 15 minutes of fame
Well Jin is the name, and I'ma finish the game
Since I got limited time, I lay it on the line
If there's shit on my mind, I'ma say it in my rhymes
I been puttin' in work you couldn't ignore
Now that I got my foot in the door, I'm puttin' in more
Still livin at home I ain't go plat yet
Come thru sittin' on chrome in a throw back lex
I could pull up in a hooptie, y'all easy to impress
When it comes to groupies, they be easy to undress
Word of advice, to y'all up and comin' acts
Don't rap about bustin' gats if you never did none of that
They know when you tellin' lies
And just cuz you worked at a bakery
That don't mean you sellin' pies
If you ask me, half these cats that gotta deal
Couldn't make a hit single if they punched a dolla bill
It wasn't always buisiness, I started it for leisure
But now I spit bars, like it's part of the procedure
Don't wanna battle? Man what type of shit is this?
You so pussy, your rap name should be Clitoris
Claim you was rockin' the crowd, don't lie to me
I been to one of ya show's, thought I was at the library
Had to drop a pin, even heard the cricket's chirp
25 at the door, but that's just what the ticket's worth
When I get on stage, you know the baddest is here
Turn the whole entire club into Madison Square
Might come to your city, and leave a part of me
Got mad love in Philly, when I rock The Armory
They applaud for me, and that's the way it oughtta be
Whack ass rappers wanna puncture an artery?
With them soft ass flows, you ain't harmin' me
I turn your 16 into a four-part harmony, Bitch...
