[In background:]
Rain, Rain Go Away

[Intro:]
What's up this is Jin
On behalf of myself and Young Pope
We'd like to dedicate this song
To all the victims at Virginia Tech
Peace

[Verse 1]
April Sixteenth, early afternoon
'bout to leave home, but I'll be back soon
Was on my way out, sat down put on my shoes
Turned on some CNN just to catch up on news
My eyes couldn't digest images on the screen
The latest reports live from the scene
I can't describe it, the words ain't quite there
Something like a dream, more like a nightmare
I'm up in N.Y., they down in V.A
But it feels like they just minutes away
Victims paid the price at such a high cost
All those innocent lives lost
Your family and friends, they carry the torch
In your memory, they're in our prayers and thoughts
It's gonna be a while, the pain is here to stay
You're in a better place, look to the sky and say

[Hook]
Rain, rain, go away!
Come again another day
Rain, rain, go away!
Come again, again, again, again
Rain, rain, go away!
Come again, another day
Rain, rain, go away!

[Verse 2]
We all God's seeds, sisters and brothers
What could make a man, take the life of another?
Don't mean to get religious, but you'll be devoured
If you don't believe in some sort of higher power
That's the same song I'm hearing _ sing
Either stand for something, or fall for anything
Just have a little faith, you need to have faith
Sometimes that's the only way you feel safe
Every day's the same, yeah it's so strange
The world is so cold, I wanna make it change
If I see a chance, I'll try not to miss it
Call me a dreamer, guess I'm just optimistic
How long will it take? It may be a while
But it's all worth it, seeing a baby smile
I know you feel the rain, don't let it cramp your style
Cause you know the sun is right behind the clouds
