[Hook 2X]
Most of y'all all sound all the same
With your fancy cars and your diamond rings
Don't you know it's about to change?
What are you so afraid of?

[Verse 1]
The emcee, master of ceremonies
My pen be faster, how dare you phonies?
That temp me, run back and your cronies
Tell how I gently mack the tenderonies (woo)
The DJ, the crowd motivator (uh huh)
We don't crossover we cross fades
Outrageous, define motion
Record scratchin' me calamine lotion (yeah)
B-Boys, highest your hands reach (uh huh)
Bomb it with two aerosol cans each
This for the future, past and the present (yeah)
I'm takin' this rap thing back to the essence (let's go)

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 2]
Yo, I rip out your tonsil now you feelin' it (feeling it)
Hip Hop is dead, you responsible for killin' it (you)
I've been set to advance the death
Breath life into the game defend what's left (yeah)
They remind me of you (you), minus the deal (yeah)
You remind me of me (me), minus the steal (yeah)
Every new week comes a song
'Till the next one hit wonder comes along
Your videos on 106 and TRL (uh huh)
Does that mean that your shit gon' sell? (uh uh)
Honestly, this joint probably won't top the charts (nah)
Cause I ain't all up in the club and I ain't about to start (come on)

[Hook 2X]

[Verse 3]
Radio suckers never play me
It's all good; y'all don't pay me (uh huh)
Even though I wanna cash in
Rather have loyalty to Jin than royalty for spins (come on)
Sell your soul for joints and jams (yeah)
'Till you fall off and disappoint your fans
They'll let you know the minute you forget ('get)
You in it for the check or you in it for respect (both)
I'm try to get both and not feel to connect (yeah)
With each one of y'all so my sales are direct
And me not try to sound all righteous (nah)
I know a lot of y'all gotta feel just like this (yeah yeah)
