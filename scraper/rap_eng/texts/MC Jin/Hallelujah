Is this the grand finale?
It’s not quite over yet
Can honestly look back and say that I have no regrets nope, not a single one
Look at what I’ve become what’s that?
A grateful man
With a precious wife and son wasn’t even 21
My future signed and sealed by 24 lost it all
First was the record deal then my confidence
That went out the window too ain’t lookin’ for no sympathy I’m simply sharin’ all
That I’ve been through
You know I don’t like
To call you a fan
This can bring a
Grown man to tears
I mean the fact that some of ya’ll have been riding with me for
More than 10 years
I know one thing for sure
And two things for certain everything went up in flames
I came out the fire
And I am not the same person now I realize
That life is just paying back time that’s borrowed
See the fact is
We can all be here today
Gone tomorrow
Everything’s a test
Will I pass?
The Answer is divine
How can I express
The way I feel?
The first word to come to my mind
Hallelujah x4
Thank you, Lord Hallelujah x2
I said thank you, Lord Hallelujah x3
Okay this is it
One final second left
What shall I say with
My very last breath?
Forget MC Jin
You should get to know me
My name is Jin Au-Yeung here’s my testimony
I didn’t grow up in the church but God planted a seed
When my Aunt Cathy asked me in Jesus did I believe
With no hesitation
Or reservation
I replied
Yes I did
Truth be told
I was eight years old
What did I know?
I was just a kid
Years go by
My life story
I acted as my own author
Just chasin’ my dreams
Along with all the things
The world could offer
I can’t even lie
All the times
That I would pray
It was shallow
And only when I wanted something to go my way
The unconditional love
That He has shown
It leaves me on my face
He’s been so patient, so kind shown me so much grace teach me
How to serve You
Lord
I’Il follow for the
Rest of my days
Sing with all
My soul, my heart
My strength
I give you all of this praise
Hallelujah x4
Thank you, Lord Hallelujah x2
I said thank you, Lord Hallelujah x3
I can still remember
Sittin’ on that subway
Leavin’ the Ruff Ryders’ office lookin’ at that check
Thinkin’ to myself
Wow, this is actually happenin’ I’ve finally...
I’ve arrived; I’m here
And everything that happened after that was like a blur
Just...
It was so much fun
It was so much pain
And then ultimately...
Just when I thought it was comin’ to a end
My career was comin’ to a end my journey was comin’ to a end God, you picked me up and
You lifted me up and showed me that what I thought was the end was really just the beginnin’
So all I ask Lord is that
From here on out
That You be the center
For anybody that listens to this they don’t just hear
They don’t hear songs
In XIV:LIX
It’s not just a album
It’s my life
Amen
