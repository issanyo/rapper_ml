[Hook: Joseph Vincent]
When the lights come on
If you only have one chance
To say what you gotta say
When the lights come on
If you wanna die tomorrow
Oh, what would you do today
I live my life
I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can hold me back from my heart
I'mma ignite when I rise from the dark

[Verse 1: Jin]
Ladies and gentlemen
I need your eyes closed sealed tight
Don't think of this is rap
This is real life
Just so you can know
Exactly what it feel like
Going where you're going
But it just doesn't feel right
Stuck in this phase
Where you can't breathe, can't leave
Held against your will
Wishing you had hands free
Just so you can find your way
Escaping from inside the maze
Praying that eventually
Darkness will turn a brighter day
Imagine for a moment
That you could see the path in front of you
In fact everything above and under you
Do you stand still or do you your best to try and stumble through
Or take a moment to reflect it
Let it humble you
See life ain't just about to cause there's effect
The decision that you make determines what happens next
Hit the switch, and you can leave the past behind
But trust me when I tell you
It'll blind ya

[Hook: Joseph Vincent]
When the lights come on
If you only have one chance
To say what you gotta say
When the lights come on
If you wanna die tomorrow
Oh, what would you do today
I live my life
I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can hold me back from my heart
I'mma ignite when I rise from the dark

[Verse 2: Jin]
Uh what sights have we seen
When the light hits you right
When it might be extreme
Throw ya shades on and stay strong
No way to block the shine
This type of right you better all stop in time
It sort of like a light when it's flashing for a picture
Paparazzi, never see it comin' until it hit ya
Unexpectedly, eventually, you see it change
Things that once were normal to you start feeling strange
You realize the world is kinda upside down
Time to readjust, plus we must shine now
People all around wanna know what's goin' on
Last night my life changed
When it came the break of dawn
All I'm tryin' to do is share how I'm growin'
When I stroll up in the spot, you swear that I was glowing
I was never perfect, never claimed to be
And due time it'll all be plain to see

[Hook: Joseph Vincent]
When the lights come on
If you only have one chance

Oh, what would you do today

I chase my dreams
Oh, there's nothing you can say to me
That can hold me back from my heart
I'mma ignite when I rise from the dark

When the lights come on
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
When the lights come on
