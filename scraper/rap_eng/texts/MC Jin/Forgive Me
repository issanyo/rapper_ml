[Intro: Bizzle]
Yo, its Bizzle!
I know it ain't easy to admit when you wrong
A lot of us walk around like we ain't got nothing to ask for forgiveness for
So for those who struggle with it
I'll go first

[Verse 1: Bizzle]
Uhh! Lord forgive me for taking you for granted
Playing you for a fake and mistaking you for santa
Aching for the steak and not thanking you for manna
Straying when I have and just praying when I have not
Lord forgive me for running to the paper
Chasing the cash with plans and coming to you later
Hoping you forgive me feeling like I know you gon forgive me
So for now I'm going for the milli
Forgive me for the times I made a promise and lied
Saying I promise to God not being honest at all
Forgive me for taking advantage of women
Forgive me for claiming I'm saved and happily sinning
Forgive me for the times I was in the strip club with my cross on
Like I was representing you and had it all wrong
And try to make it up to you would be a lost cause
If i had to name it all this would be a long song

[Hook: Bizzle]
Lord forgive me
For I sin
Over and over again
Help me change my life
My life(x4)
I read your memories of my sin
Over and over again
I repent!
Lets Go!

[Verse 2: Bizzle]
Uhh! Lord forgive me for doubting Jesus
For wondering if you even exist sometimes and not believing
For acting to busy like its no time for reading
Then hopping on the Xbox for the entire evening
For cursing your name in conversation
For every sick thought that cross my brain while I was praying
Forgive me For falling asleep in church
Then getting a sudden burst of energy as soon as I leave church
Forgive me for sitting in traffic and complaining
Instead of praying for people involved in the accident
For turning the little homies into riders for me
Forgive me for letting Eve sale her body for me
And forgive me for everytime that i played the bully
And did somebody wrong because i knew they couldn't whoop me
Forgive me for praying for different stuff
And getting mad and losing faith because it ain't happenin' quick enough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jin]
Aye!
Lord forgive me but lately all that I've been facing
Got me thinking if I'm ever escaping these temptations
Accepting defeat with my back against the wall
You kept me on my feet even when i was meant to fall
Thank You
Lord forgive me for seeking the applause
Feeding my ego and clearly the victory is yours
See me and Bizzle we both got this one thing in common
Trying to shed some light on the truth when we be rhyming
Since you don't know what we been through don't judge us
If our chances still do so we won't hold grudges
Why bother?
Life is too short to live with regret
Plus our Father teaches us we should Forgive and Forget
Yet in reality its easier said than done
Especially when you ain't a preacher or a nun
So i pray for strength and forgive them in your name
And its only by your grace that for me you'll do the same

[Hook]
