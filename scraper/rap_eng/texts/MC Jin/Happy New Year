Today's a new day, I feel like I'm ahead
Guess who woke up on the right side of bed (me!)
What sparked this power, could it be?
That in my darkest hour, I'm lookin' on the bright side instead
Whatever the case I'm never gonna waste
Another second of my life I could never replace
On that note, I make every moment count
The pleasure I get measures up to no amount
I've felt the highest high, I've seen the lowest low
I'm somewhere in between, now which way do I go?
It's obvious the answer's the TOP
The only time it's goin' down is when I'm dancin' to Jock
Other than that, I'd be advancin' the lot
Ya see that, I just advanced another slot
And this here is the only chance that I got
You will remember me. Like it or not
I've been told whatever you do
Comes back ten-fold, sounds like a deal to me
Cuz if that's the case, then you get what you give
I gave it my all so I'm pretty positive
When the final score's in at the end of the day
They'll be like "that Jin did more than OK"
Yeah that's right, I'm makin' all y'all pay
For ever doubtin', so I ignore what you all say
You can call it a defense mechanism
That's how I deal with the intense skepticism
Could it be that it was a matter of time
I was winnin' too much others had to get shine
So when I got knocked off my high horse, they was waitin'
They start celebratin' my loss
Maybe I'm buggin', maybe I'm not
Either way I solidify the spot. I'm here, I'm happy
Who needs a reason?
I've been blessed, minus the sneezin'
I stay cheesin', when flix are takin'
It's a Celebration Bitches! Why you hatin'?
And I don't even really sip champaign, but somebody pop a cork so I can hit that thang
I know by now that I'm far from sober
Yeah I'm twisted but it's far from over
Far from broke, I'm richer than some
Ya'll was lookin' for the champ well this the one
On the road to success and he has just began
The ride's been kinda rough, but it's been fun
If I could go back and rearrange the plan
I wouldn't change a thing cuz it made me who I am
I could see past the mistakes
It ain't about how you get here, it's the path that you take
Wait, I feel great
I wanna wish ya'll a Happy New Year
I'm sayin' it's right around the corner
I'm callin' this year, two thousand and eight
Two thousand and GREAT
Cuz I foresee a great year
