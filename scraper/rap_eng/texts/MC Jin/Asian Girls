I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls galore
So put your on this napkin
I would love to make it happen
Holla at me at the corner store (Let's go)

Now if you think all Asian women are the same, you got it twisted
So many different dishes, all so delicious
Got this chick from Saigon, hundred percent Viet
Nickname is do-do cause her body is the shit
Got this chick named Renee, she's brune
Born from the Phillipines to the USA
A down ass shorty from around the way
Even got this Thai girl that says she rock my world
Got this cute Korean chick but she be gettin' me mad
Always beggin' me to buy her new Gucci bags
Yo, I get mad love from this Cambodian broad
But she just wants tickets to the Source Awards
Got this Japanese chick, won't let me get in her blouse
Cause I never take my Timbs off when I step in her house
I tell this Chinese chick to quit bootleggin' yo shit
But damn she be sellin' it quick (man!)
That's a Chinese girl, Korean girl, even got a Jap
That's fried rice and eggrolls, damn I'm gettin' fat
Sushi and Kim Chi, damn that's great
If I didn't eat with chopsticks
I'd scrape the plate

I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls galore
So put your on this napkin
I would love to make it happen
Holla at me at the corner store
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls I need
Hot damn it
Love how mami's eyes be slanted
And she ain't even smoke no trees (come one)

I got one question, where my Asian ladies at?
Dipped in Echo red or that Baby Phat
You know the type, listens to Hov and Big Poppa
Works in a nail shop so her fingers stay proper
I can't knock ya, with your hair all done
Lookin' fly and corn rows are wrapped up in a bun
Listen close, and bang this from to coast to coast
East to West, all types of freaks I bless
Heard in Cali, out in the Bay Area
Nuttin' but racin' models, shaped like Coca-Cola bottles
Back on the East, my Asian shorties lookin' cute
Rockin' Timb boots with the North Face goose
I got love for all flavors, so get your mind right
But I gotta put my Asian mamis in the lime light (of course)
I got love for y'all and I'm your favorite too
Be proud of who you are, this song's dedicated to you

I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls galore
So put your on this napkin
I would love to make it happen
Holla at me at the corner store
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls I need
Hot damn it
Love how mami's eyes be slanted
And she ain't even smoke no trees (one more time)
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls galore
So put your on this napkin
I would love to make it happen
Holla at me at the corner store (right)
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Asian girls I need
Hot damn it
Love how mami's eyes be slanted
And she ain't even smoke no trees

Uh, uh
I'm sayin', you know I got love for all of y'all ladies out there
I don't care if you're black, white, can't forget about my Latinas
But you know I had to show my Asian mamis some love
Let 'em know that they appreciated ya know what I mean
Jin's here, I love all of y'all
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
