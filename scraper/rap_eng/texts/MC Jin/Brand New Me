[Verse 1]
How you doin'? You might not recognize me
But guess what, that don't even surprise me
Lately, I've been through so much
But as you can see, I ain't lose my touch
Somethin' got me feelin' so brand new
Lookin' in the mirror like "Who are you?"
Not brand new in a bougie way
I mean brand new cause I'm so cool these days
And my team is too
Makin' sure my visions a dream come true
Just got another check time to make a deposit
Then pick somethin' fresh out of my closet

[Bridge]
A brand new 'fit some brand new kicks
You got your camera, then take some pics
You feel down well that's okay
Cause tomorrow is a brand new day

[Hook]
You know how I-I-I do
Don't worry 'bout me I'm-I'm cool
All I need is me and my-my crew
Feelin' like feelin' like I'm brand new
You know how I-I-I do
Don't worry 'bout me I'm-I'm cool
All I need is me and my-my crew
Feelin' like feelin' like I'm brand new

I'm brand new (hey, hey) (x3)
I'm brand new
I'm brand new (hey, hey) (x2)
There's no way you can't see
You're looking at a brand new me

[Verse 2]
Check it out yo, here's the game plan
If you feel brand new then this yo jam
Put ya hands up all across the land
No need to trip cause you know we fam
I'm chillin' so comfortably
In the midst of great company
Guess what, even if you don't know me
All you need to know is that I ain't the old me
And tomorrow's a brand new day
As long as I got God every things okay
Before the show, I gotta get right
Keep it fresh you know just somethin' light

[Bridge]
A brand new 'fit some brand new kicks
You got yo camera then take some pics
You feel down well that's okay
Cause tomorrow is a brand new day

[Hook]

I said you're lookin' at a brand new me
