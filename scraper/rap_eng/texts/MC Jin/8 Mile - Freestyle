[Verse 1]
I was bamboozled, fooled into thinkin' it was gonna be
All poodles, now I see a bunch of pits in front of me
No collars, chains off
Ready at any given moment to tear shit up like a chainsaw
Better bite before you bark
Yeah I was on 106, but that was just a walk in the park
So we on the same show
But I was on for 7 weeks before you even saw my face in a video
Only difference between you and me?
Is that heads is actually anticipatin' for my cd
Like 50 Cent, I got bigger fish to fry
And I'll give it to any rapper that wish to die
Used to never smoke
But now all I do is stay high
Chickens on my nuts sayin', "Jin you stay fly"
But I would trade it all, in a blink of an eye
So that when they speak of the dopest, you'll be thinkin' of thy
He say, she say, he sound like him
Get it correct, only rapper that I sound like is Jin
Come on, it ain't hard to distinguish
Even my Pops can tell the difference and he barely speaks English
Swear to God, he knows every one of my flows
If you don't think I got supporters, come to one of my shows
Comin' out by the masses, seen the line around the block
And I ain't even got vinyl out, you can't deny it, I'm hot
Chasin' me down the street, takin' pictures in a van
It's a thin line between a dick rider and a fan
Got love for all of y'all, especially those that love to hate
So when I got triple plat, I can rub it in your face
They 'bout to make June 4th a holiday in Asia
Cause a star was born and he got signed to a major
I'm down to sign autographs, it ain't a hassle
But just cause I don't got a pen, don't make me an asshole
Even Ava got fans, they stay speakin' her name
Caught her writin' on the 'lo, you think she sick as the fame
Hip-hop ain't just music, it's the way that we live
I pray I get to see the day that I could say to my kid
"Your father was one of the greatest to ever be heard
Pay attention, son, listen close to every word
Do what you should do, and I'm what you would do
See I did my best and that was all that I could do"
And none of y'all motherfuckers know what I've been through
