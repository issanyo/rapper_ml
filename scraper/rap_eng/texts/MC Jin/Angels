[Intro:]
You know I gotta say something;
The beginning and the end, what's the difference between the two?
I mean I'm still trying to figure it out
I know one thing
I'm just getting started
You know all that stuff that happened in the past?
I ain't even thinking about that
It's about right now
And it's about moving forward

[Verse 1:]
Uh, Check, Check, Yo..
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
The more it makes sense
The more they claim that I'm crazy
I had to be for them to see me this calm
All reality, uh-uh, no TV sitcom
My pure will got me stolen from Grace
Eyes closed, salty tears all I could taste
Fall on my knees
Fall on my face
They say put God first and everything else will fall into place
So I've heard
Wise words got me thinking
Gotta give it time to let it sink in
I sound confused, I know
For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world
Then lose his soul
For the longest I was riding high, cruise control
In my own mind making up the rules as I go
I swear it's not just my imagination
I heard a voice guiding me, navigation
Is it the road I chose or should I check the steering
Took a couple wrong turns, selective hearing
Is it fact or just my premonition?
I see what's going on now, High Definition

Nothing but lies, I was living that
Wasted like lasiks, it took me time to get my vision back
Learned to recognize the fakes and the true snakes
So called friends, you know the two-faced
All in my grill like a toothache
Still you never find me under pressure
Like the last drop of toothpaste
My mission is never been more clear
The truth is never been more near
But I know I can't do it on my own
So I pray you give me strength when I lift the microphone
All I hear is "Jin, What happened to the old you?"
See I could explain but I would rather show you
Word, check it out y'all

Cause actions speak louder than words
So it don't matter how I mix the nouns with the verbs
New fans are glad, God anointed my style
Old fans wanna know "What will I rap about now?"
Switch it up?
Yo, I gots to do it
The word is Jin's putting out Gospel music
See, I prefer to call it "Change-Your-Life" music
All in hopes that one day you might use it
Whatever they choose to label it, so be it
I proceed it
All I know is, I so need it
I'm certain that I can't rap forever
Before the curtain call I gotta get my act together

No surprise the wool over my eyes has been lifted
My entire perspective has been shifted
I can't call it
You can call it how you feel
Call it change, call it growth
As long as you call it real
I am no quitter
My journey's just begun
You are all welcome to follow, no Twitter

I know plenty of folks that wanna touch the gates of Heaven
Never been to church cause they can't relate to Reverends
Ain't no sense in me preaching to the Choir
Even with scorched arms
I'll be reaching through the fire

I stand firm
The enemy don't phase me
No need to wonder...
ONLY GOD CAN SAVE ME
