[Verse 1: HeeSun Lee]
When I rap you know I have fun with it
But I really do it 'cause I'm kinda nice with it
Stereotypes rather have me just doing dishes
But the flow and the skills just prove different
God gifted, He all on it
Change the game in a song, I'm on it
No more judging, I disowned it
Makes the world look shallow, don't it?
Hold it, this the truth I'm grasping
Never seen a chick like me I'm asking
Flashin' signs when you see me passing
Hope you get these words I'm blasting
These female rappers rapping like they got no sense in 'em
I'm here to change it up a bit, I'm hoping I can strengthen them
Hoping to put length in them so more ladies will step on in
And make a difference once 'n' for all, tired of us blending in
Through with it, not doing it
All the haters out there keep booing it
See, I got morals and a little bit of respect for myself
Won't ruin it
Applaud this movement, what an improvement
How many more will stand up and start doing it?
Gotta prepare for the challenges coming
We're one of a kind we're proving it!
Break out my shell, can you tell I'm hype?
This a new day, better get it right
Everybody shout with all your might
We breakin' stereotypes

[Chorus: HeeSun Lee & MC Jin]
Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
Go get yo' mind right
[?] get yo' mind right

Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
And get yo' mind right
Homie get yo' mind right

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
Time to get my mind right
Wanna know what I don't like?
(One sec)
Man, I feel like I've been stereotyped my whole life
Had me so tight, chip on my shoulders, can you blame me?
Tried every single way, threw everything my way
But still couldn't break me
It's your fault that my will is so strong
I guess I should thank you, huh?
While I'm killing this song
Feeling these emotions
Kill your preconceived notions
You have no idea of who you are approaching
Tatt on my neck, cross on my chest
Something that you prolly didn't expect
Used to be cocky and so full of arrogance
Thankful that my daddy keeps me in check
Next time you see someone, try 'n' see the whole person
Don't be so close-minded, hope you find it, soul searching
Hey yo, me 'n' HeeSun, both coming thru
Breakin' stereotypes, they ask me who are you?
I'm a Christian, I'm a father, I'm a son, oh, and I rap too

[Chorus: HeeSun Lee & MC Jin]
Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
Go get yo' mind right
[?] get yo' mind right

Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
And get yo' mind right
Homie get yo' mind right

[Verse 3: HeeSun Lee]
I see you looking at me crazy
'Bout to say something shady
But you dunno the first thing about me
Really wanna know, just come 'n' ask me
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
I'm a rapper, and I'm a Christian
Yeah, this a whole new lifestyle in the making
And I'll make it, don't mistake it
Gotta face that'll break every stereotype
Watch met take it
No stalling, better be prepared when the Lord start calling
Gotta put your all in, no half steppin', no redirectin'
This your place, better learn how to fall in
Yeah, read my bio, born in Korea, been quite awhile
Now I got this rapping gig that Jesus called me for, He dialed!
Never backing down I'll prove this
That an Asian girl won't lose this
See me rock on stages, write these pages
Show the world I can do this
Yeah and I'm OD-ing on this track
Never see me step back
These facts coming thru when I rap
Never take no flack
Don't take no naps
Don't fade to black
See me on the map
Everywhere I go make a difference
Never gonna stop praying that I fill in the gaps, gaps, gaps, rah!

[Chorus: HeeSun Lee & MC Jin]
Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
Go get yo' mind right
[?] get yo' mind right

Breakin' stereotypes
Breakin' stereotypes
I'm not my gender my color or my class
Breakin' stereotypes
We breakin' stereotypes
And get yo' mind right
Homie get yo' mind right
