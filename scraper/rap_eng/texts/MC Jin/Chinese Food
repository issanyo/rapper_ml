[Intro]
My life has been like
One long journey filled with a lot of ups
And definitely a lot of downs
Check it

[Verse]
I dedicate this verse here
To my grandfather who passed away earlier this year
At his funeral, I ran threw a box full of tissues
My tears are dry, but I still miss you
And I promise I will never forget you
These last six bars just made it official
Yeah, I know he can hear me
Even though he don't speak English, he can understand clearly
What his grandson is trying to express
It's tough but I'm trying my best
I remember as a kid just running with him
Every year I spend a whole summer with him
Visited him in the projects
And he knew I was intrigued by them shiny objects
Cutting a Rolex out of magazine ads
Tell me when I grow up I could buy one for my dad
So much energy, like me quite clever
These are memories I will treasure forever
Every now and then I still shed a tear
Walking through Chinatown I feel his spirit in the air
For your legacy I go harder
Tell my kids your great grandfather was a "great grandfather"
But let me walk you to this timeline
Take you back to my pops and mom's grind
They both immigrated to this country as teenagers
You know tropical American dream chasers
Immigrating blew up like disco
As we moving to New York then to Frisco
My pops said NY let's go
This was in the 70's when he used to rock a fro
Bell bottoms, pimp hat with the tilted brim
I seen the pictures and I still don't think it's him
Fast forward, '82 that was when he met my moms
Got married and had a baby too
That baby who? That baby's me - Jin Au-Yeung
My moms was wild young
Only eighteen a senior in high school
When I was eighteen, that was my school
I'm in charge of her life
I put that in every single bar that I write
Picture a young couple trying to get on track
What are the options a restaurant or laundry mat?
So they chose plan A
So I was at the restaurant every damn day
But I was only twelve, I justed wanted to play
When my friends would come, I gave the food away
I know it that bad for business
So I apologize now if it still makes a difference
I guess deep down I just hated the fact I felt trapped
And that was my way of getting you back
I can't go back in time and I hate it
But I can't tell you that your hard work was appreciated
See to the customer that just a plate of rice
But to my family that shit can save a life
It's more then Chinese food
It's a life story of a Chinese dude
And I ain't come here to tell you what to eat
It just food for thought over a beat
