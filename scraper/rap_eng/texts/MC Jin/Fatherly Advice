[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Look son this is important, I say this from the heart
You got that spark in your eyes, I can tell that you're smart
Forget the stars if you want, you can reach Mars
But first off, you gotta know how to count bars
It's easy to recognize a 16
Follow along and you'll see exactly what I mean
Ready?
Something, something, something
Something, something, one
Something, something, something
Something, something, two
That's the gist of it, every line is calculated
When flows change, it can be a bit complicated
We'll go deeper next time, when mommy's out of town
Cause you know, she don't want too many rappers in the house
Every now and then, there's drama and we fuss
It's not because of you, that's just how grown-ups deal with stuff
But when you find someone who captures your heart
You'd rather had bad times together than good times apart
Work it out, we always find a way
Make sure you tell momma "I love you" at least three times a day
Oh yeah, and don't forget to pray
And don't forget to pray

[Chorus: MC Jin]
I be always jumping on the mic
Talk about how I'm nice, and how I'm nice
Nope, no, no not tonight
I'm just trying to give some fatherly advice
I be always jumping on the mic
Talk about how I'm nice, and how I'm nice
Nope, no, no not tonight
I'm just trying to give some fatherly advice

[Bridge: MC Jin]
Hey if nobody's listening, I know you are
Right? I mean, you're my number 1 fan
I think

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
I'm still learning daily, so there's a limit to my knowledge
And no, daddy didn't go to college
Now don't think for a second that I'm saying you shouldn't
My only dream is for you to do what I couldn't
This may be a premature conversation here
Cause you ain't even starting first grade this year
I'm sure we might as well skip the birds and bees
When you're old enough I'm sure I'll get the third degree
It's never too early though to talk about respect
Show love to everyone, better to give than to collect
It won't be all sunshine, there will be rainy days
You see this piggy bank? Make sure you save away
June 1st, 2012, things ain't ever been the same
Every chance is a blessing, there's how you got your name
It's getting late, so go and brush your teeth
I'll tell you a bedtime story, and then it's off to sleep

[Bridge: Chance the Son and MC Jin]
Daddy, daddy (good night)
I want you to hear something (what you mean you want me to hear something?)
My rhymes (oh okay)
Now get out (let me hear it then)
Okay

[Verse 3: Chance the Son]
One plus one, equals two
I'm gonna catch a Pikachu
Two plus two, equals four
I'm gonna catch a Bulbasaur
My name is Chance
I like to dance
And I never pee my pants
When I play games, I always win
My daddy's name is MC Jin!
