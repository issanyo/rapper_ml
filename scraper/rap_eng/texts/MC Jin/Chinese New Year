[Verse 1]
My peoples keep their head up
In the truest display
Do what they gotta do
Just to get through the day
Back in Hong Kong
Where they grew up and stayed
Until they immigrated to the US of A
Chasin’ the American Dream
A ruff ryde for my pops
Guess what
He still shut em down
Open up shop
In the back of the kitchen
Makin’ wontons
Late nights out with my moms
Playin’ mahjong
See I was a young’n
But the culture was inside of me
Playin’ cards Big 2
Never want the diamond three
Every Sunday
It was part of the tradition
While y’all was at church
Dimsum was our religion
I’m on a quest for love
That’s just part of my pursuits
No matter where I go
I’m always stickin’ to my roots
Show you my world
That’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for me
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday

[Verse 2]
While we on the topic
I got something to reveal
Can I be real though
I mean really real
Cause at one point
Yo I was losin’ sleep
Thinkin’ bout the first song
That I ever released
Lookin’ back it was a
Lesson in my eyes
And if you never heard of it
Hey that’s just
A blessin’ in disguise
Learn Chinese dropped
Things never been the same
Credibility gone
Charge it to the game
Truly though seemed like a
Scene straight outta movie
I was in the studio
With 1/3 of The Fugees
It’d be a understatement
To say I was excited
So when Clef said that’s it
I ain’t hesitate to write it
I was barely 21
But that’s not an excuse
I got on my own two feet
And walked into that booth
To make y’all proud
That’s all I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for me
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday

[Verse 3]
Roll out the red carpet
Guess we’ve finally arrived
0% luck
100% drive
For your safety
I went through the crash test
Life is a road trip
Can’t rely on MapQuest
This is for my sisters
And my brothers strugglin’
Here’s hopin’ that
You can find comfort in your skin
Not better not worse
We just equally blessed
They say we fresh off the boat
Yeah the key word is fresh
Walk a mile in my shoes
Feel the pressure produced
When you’re mentioned
In the same sentence as Bruce
Leeway none given
Hard to fill a tall order
Almost drowned in the hype
Now I’m just tryin’ to be water
Chinese or not
This is for whoever will listen
Listen we are more similar
Than different
Unite us all
That’s what I’m tryin’ to do here
Cause for us
Everyday is Chinese New Year

[Chorus]
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But I ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday is Chinese New Year
Gung hay fat choy
New day new hope
But we ain’t new here
Lai see dao loi
Everyday everyday
