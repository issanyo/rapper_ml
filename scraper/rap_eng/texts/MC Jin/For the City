For the city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]
We rep the people with honor
Put the bomb marijuana
Like my mother and father
For the city
We say peace to the drama
Peace out to bad karma
'Cause peace is what I want
For my city
Ain't never become a thang
Just a one love dap hug family day
Give a dollar, take two, street hustlers do you
Nothin' comin' 'bout food when life is past due
Real dudes do the walking 'cause the streets do the talking
Real mommas do both and brew a damn good coffee
My city showed love to hucchi mamas and G's
Ordinary afternoons sunsets and palm trees
Hustle boobs to the roxy rocked it properly
Puttin' that work in for my city watch me
Rap world wide all for the west side
Throw your three fingers up at all times

[Hook: Kev Nish]
For my city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
For the city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
For the city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
For the city
We stay high, stay fly
For the city
Live good, Stay right
For the city

[Verse 2: Prohgress]
I'm from the city of angels
Everybody gotta drive
So the streets is dangerous
Drive slow or the cops will get ya
And sit back while I paint this picture
It's been my home for about two decades
Folks rock T and C to their tele teles
Always rep L.A
On they white and blue cap
Two in the morning ain't a place to get your booze at

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
And I love my block
With the dimmed out street lights
Thugs do they thing under the busted ass street sign
Better lock your car before it turns into a G-ride
Tourists taking pictures looking happy holding peace signs
G's catching cases just a couple blocks down
The LAPD got 'em serving beat down
We learning ghetto law but we had to raise hell
Now we all doing well tryna stay outta jail

[Hook: Kev Nish]
For the city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
For the city
We stay high, stay fly
Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
For the city
Live good, Stay right
We stay high, stay fly
For the city
Live good, Stay right
For the city
For the city

[Verse 4: Jin]
From the cities in the states
To cities abroad
I'm like that cool dude Benny
And city of gods
It's love when the city's at peace
Or the city's at odds
Either way I need to stay
Wherever I am within a five mile radius
From the night life, bright lights, and the craziness
Yeah, we live it up, so give it up
For-For-For-What?
The urban life, far from a suburbanite
A shot of Bourbon, twisting up the urban night
Makes things a bit easier to tackle
I'm from the orange state, now I'm in the big apple
The hip-hop Mecca
Bomb beats and concrete
When the time wear long Johns and turn on heat
Yo, the west is where it's at
I'm thinking 'bout going-going back-back
If I catch the 4pm to Long Beach I suppose
Catch could scoop me up right before the clubs close
On behalf of the Far Easty boys kings
Throw up three fingers y'all and make some noise for who?

Stay real, for real
Live good, Stay right
