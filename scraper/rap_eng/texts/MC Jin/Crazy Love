[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Tell me do you believe in love at first sight?
It catches you the moment you fall but it hurts like
If you were to ever lose it you would fall to pieces
No need to wonder yeah I'm talkin' bout the love of Jesus
See God sent us a gift in His son
Our Lord and Savior oh the magnificent one
To the nonbelievers I probably sound delirious
What's really crazy is I'm speakin' from experience
Traced back to the moment of my conception
After all these years I finally made the connection
Arms wide open His object of affection
Yet I kept runnin' in the opposite direction
Status of a master but You'd rather be a servant
Unworthy of Your love still my life you chose to purchase
Only when I found You my life was given purpose
Crazy in love so I'm livin' just to worship

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
Now that I got a taste of it I can never get enough
Through the ups and the downs when I'm down You lift me up
And if I ever fall again I mean when I do fall again
You're by my side just like a crutch
Your touch is unattainable yet as gentle as can be
Your love runs deeper than the sea
By Your grace I'll be swimmin' in it for eternity
Set my heart on fire then let the flame burn in me
Your greatness can't be matched nor can they mimic it
Try to count my blessings but it's unlimited
Infinite wisdom that only You possess
Stuck in my foolish ways but You don't love me any less
As I continue to gaze upon You on Your throne
Deserted by the world yet I know I'm not alone
Only when I found You my life was given purpose
Crazy in love so I'm livin' just to worship

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love

[Bridge: Uncle Reece]
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
I'm holdin' on
To Your love
Yeah

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
The more I think about it the more it blows my mind
How you manage to be so patient and so kind
Never self seeking temper under control
Even when You know I'm wrong You just choose to let it go
Always protective that's why I trust You with my fears
The hope that You provide allows me to persevere
Only when I found You my life was given purpose
Your love never fails so I'm livin' just to worship

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love
I can't control how I feel without Your love I go crazy
I'm crazy in love with You
No matter what I go through
I'm holdin' on to this crazy love

[Outro: Uncle Reece]
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
I'm holdin' on
To Your love
Yeah
