[Intro]
Yeah, I'm Chinese and what
Yeah, you know who this is, Jin
Let me tell you this
The days of the pork fried rice and the chicken wings
Coming to your house by me is over

[Refrain x2]
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese

[Verse 1]
This Hip-Hop shit could fuck up your head man
I know a bunch of Crips that love Redman
Blood Walk in New York, man, things done change
Stop, the Chinks be all over the game
This ain't Bruce Lee, I watch too much TV
This is a game of death when I aim for your chest
Too much cess got me seein' slow motion
Eyes barely open with a roach roastin'
And your girl, she loves the Jin ocean
Rub it on her body like Body Shop lotion
What's the commotion, you never seen me
The original chinky-eyed emcee
You don't want to step to the army
And Double-R rank refugee
And the barrel of the gun is gonna make you speak
Another language
And amigo I ain't talking about Spanish

[Refrain x2]

[Verse 2]
This one goes out to those that order four chicken wings
And pork fried rice and throw dice
In the hood, you think this is all good
Till the cowboys roll through like Clint Eastwood
I wish you would come to Chinatown
Get lost in town, end up in the lost and found
Eyewitnesses, you must be crazy
We don't speak English, we speak Chinese
And the only po-po we know is the pigs on the hood out in the window
Every time they harass me, I wanna explode
We should ride the train for free, we built the railroads
I ain't ya 50 Cent, I ain't ya Eminem
I ain't ya Jigga Man, I'm a chinaman
Ginseng in the palm of my hand
She looks surprised in the palm of my hands
You know what's next, safe sex
I'll be damned if I sleep in the flesh with the insect

[Refrain x2]

(Woman singing)
(Jin speaking Chinese: This one sounds good. Let's give her a call on the phone.)
Mr. Jin, you are the sexiest man
Mr. Jin, I love the way you do your things
(Jin speaking Chinese: Really)
Mr. Jin, you are the sexiest man
Mr. Jin, I love the way you do your things

[Verse 3]
The moral of the story is
Don't judge a book by its cover
I know you think he's fam, but he's really undercover
I saw his name on the affidavit
It was written in Chinese and this is what he said:
(Jin Speaking Chinese: The chinese restaurant is closing soon)
Bring about some local hooligans and thugs so
Catch them at midnight when they close the shop up
Reading the Ten Commandments, cooking the crock up
Biggie Smalls posters are all over the walls
If they think you'd save me the bullet, it's so over ya'll
Me, I'm just Jin just doing my thang
Just doing my thang, just doing my thang
Why is there beef everywhere I go?
I'm drunk skewing, can't we all get along
My ladies with the thongs, my thugs with the firearms

[Refrain: modified]
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Wyclef: all the ghetto)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Wyclef: all the suburb)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese (Wyclef: Refugees)

Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Jin speaking Chinese: dai lo)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese (Jin speaking Chinese: Hurry, get out of here)
Ya'll gonna learn Chinese
When the pumps come out, ya'll gon' speak Chinese

(Woman singing)

[Refrain]

[Wyclef]
The game will never be the same
(Jin speaking Chinese: I already played the game)
Double-R refugees
(Jin speaking Chinese: Let's go home)
First Chinese rapper
First Haitian rapper
Refugees
(Jin speaking Chinese: Chinatown)
(Jin speaking Chinese: I already played the game)
(Jin speaking Chinese: That's it)
