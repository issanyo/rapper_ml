[Intro]
Uh Jin

[Verse]
I treat this rap shit sorta like the NBA
Everytime I spit a rhyme is like shooting a jay
Fuck that scholarship shit my flow gotta be set
Straight outta high school number one lottery pick
I know the whole league doubting me
But lookie here I'm 'bout to make rookie of the year
'cause double R was scouting me
Got ma own jersey is a known fact
So when Jin go plat (platinum) you can have a Jin throwback
Now yo' ass can sit on the bench listen to ya coach cause
You trying to freestyle he telling you to post up
You got a deal but you bout to be a free agent
Ya technical fouls ya team actin' flagrant
You need help man ya albums on the shelf man
You ain't even the sixth you more like the 12th man
You that cat wit'cha warm up suit on the whole game
Giving High fives patting asses they don't no ya name
What a shame chasing somebody's balls
You that dude that wipe the floor after somebody falls
I'm a All-Star rhymer repping China
The Yao Ming of this rap game starting an empire
Like Jordan and Pippen Kobe and Shaq
Is like a triple-double everytime I spit on a track
Keep this heat blazing in the streets I'm amazing
Is the NBA shit nobody beats Asians
