[Verse 1: Erick Dayz]
Interrupting your program
We sponsored by The Of Most
[?] and [?] to share the light and call them cut throat
Constant reminder of the flesh, spirit is tough so Jewelee Oohlees left the chain off this bull, remove the muzzle (we've broke loose)
Free of violence, [?], we [?] about it
Keep the fro willies in their place and tell 'em read about it (fall back)
It's all youth, and they're hiding behind your back, sorrow
This is souvenir and we're fighting and many so [?]
What's the reason though
And we bow before His knees and 'fore we mobbin' in your regional
Mission but my feet are long distance from the [?] on a pavement
The page with
Swift to the victory and we skip trial but bullet grazed though
[?] after penetration, the amazing, new heart
Something in me ain't frontin' and we fighting 'til death
Your soul filling a void
We sharper than arrows
Used to be a sporty thief no picture on [?]

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Put me on the frontline
Through the blood, sweat and tears
Fighting for soul, it is what it is
This is my life
Oh, oh
This is not an event
This is everyday living
Straight & Narrow is the army, I'm a territory gift
And this is my life
Oh, oh
This is my life

[Verse 2: A-FLO]
This is a Heaven sent essence
Elegant with intelligence
I am the evidence of natural hip-hop eloquence
The path is narrow but I soldier on the straight line
He turned water to wine
And I need ya hear that, get it great vine
People say I ain't never gonna blow chowder, accept it because I ain't eating my gold, my gold
I'd rather the voice of a believer
While you are trying to hit us back I stay puffin' on a reefer
You ain't know the Lord with case T
So it turn to rust and then you wonder why you had know one to trust
Tried to fathom a beautiful passion
One you can't imagine
It's on the Lord I'm braagging
El Shaddai, Adonai, Yahweh Nissi, [?], Shammah, Elohim, Shalom, Jehovah Jireh
All props of the infinity trinity who delivered me from [?] praise His [?]

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Put me on the frontline
Through the blood, sweat and tears
Fighting for soul, it is what it is
This is my life
Oh, oh
This is not an event
This is everyday living
Straight & Narrow is the army, I'm a territory gift
And this is my life
Oh, oh
This is my life

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
You see the thing about jumping on this posse cuts
You got to keep a mind set like you cannot be touched
At least that's what I was told
So like a low scoring soccer game, there can only be one goal
To out shine
Whoever tries to rhyme with me
Self centred I was to blind to see
That ain't at all how I was designed to be
Now as long as God gets to shine it's all fine with me
You see these thoughts
We painted like it's art
That aim is for the charts
We aiming for your heart
Garbage in my mind it's time to take the trash out
That's why I'm on my knees and I worship 'til I pass out
The breathe of life is keeping me resuscitated
That's how I know me and Uncle Reece are both related
The blood of Christ covers my head with no regret
I step into the battlefield with hands covered in sweat

[Bridge: MC Jin]
Tears shoot from my eyes like a faithful arrow
Save my prayers, I'm walking on the straight and narrow
Tears shoot from my eyes like a faithful arrow
Save my prayers, I'm walking on the straight and narrow
Walking on the straight and narrow
Walking on the straight and narrow
Walking on the straight and narrow
Walking on the straight and narrow

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Put me on the frontline
Through the blood, sweat and tears
Fighting for soul, it is what it is
This is my life
Oh, oh
This is not an event
This is everyday living
Straight & Narrow is the army, I'm a territory gift
And this is my life
Oh, oh
This is my life
