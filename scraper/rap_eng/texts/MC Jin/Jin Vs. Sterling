Uh, yea, yo, yo, yo, yo, ay yo

Why you got me battlin' Bruce Lee grandson?
Yo, I'm a Star, he just a rookie
Leave rap alone and keep making fortune cookies

His mom was a menace to society sayin' "hurry up and buy"
In the hood is where they'll find yo body, dog

Look, I kick raps and spit fire, yo
He just kick and be like "hiya"
Dog I know why yo eyes is chinky
Cuz you keep starin at my pinky yo let's go
Holla back

Check your Timbs they probably say "made in China"
Don't make me get on this tip and straight kill ya
His name is Sterling cause all he rocks is silver
Dude, you, stop followin trends
Your girl must love alcohol cause she be swallowin' Jin
Yo imma bout to flip the script when it's comin' to it
Ay yo you see me spittin on the block you runnin' to it

I saw him breakdancing for spare change on 40-deuce
