(verse 1 )

Can you believe it , a whole decade has gone by
Since i dropped my first album , man time flies
Where does it go, nobody knows
I appreciate you all , for coming to the shows
Just to get front row , so that i can see your sign
Showing up hours early , didn't even mind
Cos when i hit the stage , nothing else matter
We were on cloud 9 , till my dreams got shattered
Felt like the spotlight , faded overnight
I can only blame myself , cos i fell into the hype
Couldn't admit it hurt , the game was so intense
They threw dirt on my name , but you came to my defense
Some abandoned ship , but you stuck around
Even supported the projects i put out underground
As far as my career , its like i crash and survived
All these years it was you that kept my passion alive

(chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family

( Verse 2 )

They talk about it , like it was just yesterday
Overwhelmed by the love that they sent my way
You know what blows my mind when they say ?
Jin i remember i was in the 7th grade
I used to watch you every week i was so amazed
Up there to compete , man it felt like i was on that stage
And when you got signed i got signed too
Yea thats why i'll always stand behind you
See that was something i was not prepared for
Still figuring things out for myself therefore
All the songs about getting drunk or smokin up
Never crossed my mind the messages you were soakin up
Didn't realise where i was till i was in it
Truth is , that was never me to begin with
Hopefully , we'll be face to face someday
And we'll both see how we have come such a long way

(chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family

(verse 2)

Lets connect , thats exactly why i came
Showing love , wanna hug , take a picture
Sign my name , sure thing , as long as i ain't in a hurry
Can always re-take it if the picture looks blurry
Hand shakin , hey no need to be nervous
Take a deep breath (huh ) none of us are perfect
I know you might have expectations
But i'm just a man , not to be idolized
I hope you understand..
So feel free to take me off that pedestal
I'd rather see you eye to eye , now there's a better view
We have lots in common , and all of it is real
Share the same emotions , that life can make you feel
Your support is unconditional , they dont understand it
Between me and you , i will not take it for granted
Reach out anytime , send a email ..
No offence though ..  thats my  g'mail(

Chorus)

You're more than just a fan to me x3
I think of you as family
