It's not that I believe
But that I am trying
'Cause It's the only,
The only thing I can do
I want to stay here
I still want to dream here
Even so, I know the time to leave
Has come near

Yeah it’s my truth
It’s my truth
That these scars are drawn across my skin
But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Even so, I still want to fight and win

Maybe I, I can never fly
Fly like those flower petals there;
Spread my wings in the air
No, I can't (Yeah)
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Even so, I reach out my hand,
Run like I just began, a bit more

In all this darkness I'm just walking, I'm walking along
My happiness comes up to me and asks me with a frown,
"Are you, Are you sure that you are okay?"
Oh no
I whisper, "No, I'm really not, I'm not. I'm so Afraid."
Holding onto the flowers tightly in my hand, I say,
"I-I'm... I'm just walking, walking along."

But it’s my fate
It’s my fate
Even so, I still want to fight and win

Maybe I, I can never fly
Fly like those flower petals there;
Spread my wings in the air
No, I can't (Yeah)
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Even so, I reach out my hand,
Run like I just began, a bit more

Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lie
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
Don’t cry
Wide awake wide awake wide awake
No lie

Maybe I, I can never fly
Fly like those flower petals there;
Spread my wings in the air
No, I can't (Yeah)
Maybe I, I can’t touch the sky
Even so, I reach out my hand,
Run like,
I just began,
A bit more..
