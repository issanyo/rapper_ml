[Intro: MC Jin]
No question I've been through so much
And ya'll feel like I've done so much
Yet I feel like I still got a lot to do
So here we go

[Hook: MC Jin]
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes
But ultimately I rely on His grace
(and what about what about you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes
In the end gota rely on your faith

[Verse 1: MC Jin]
I know what ya'll are sayin' Jin done lost his mind
But through out all this prayin' it never crossed my mind
Here's what I advise instead of tryin' to figure me out
Open your eyes it's time to stop livin' in doubt
I'm on a mission to exceed the expectations
And I won't stop 'til I reach my destination
We livin' in times where it's hard to survive
But not for a second do I doubt that God will provide
Whatever happens I trust that it's all in His plans
Cause my destiny lays in the palm of His hands
If it's in His will there's nothin' that can't be done
They tried to pull me under but I will overcome

[Bridge: MC Jin]
See life tends to put me in these situations
Waiting to see my reaction
And how I react determines how I'll overcome
What am I willing to do?

[Hook: MC Jin]
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes
But ultimately I rely on His grace
(and what about what about you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes in the end gota rely on your faith

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
For my oldself might as well start diggin' a grave
I been in prison minus the bars now this sinner is saved
Time to get my life on track I'm sick of livin' this way
No turnin' back at this point the decision is made
I ain't 'gon lie it won't be easy cause I been conditioned
To tune out the voice of reason it's time that I listened
At the same time tryin' to find ways I can help
Lost souls at the crossroads not just savin' myself
We've all been given options nothin' is mandatory
Freewill is a gift and it's self explanatory
If it's in His will there's nothin' that can't be done
They'll try to pull us under but we will overcome

[Bridge: MC Jin]
See it's not about you
It's not about me
It's about us
How we uplift each other
How we inspire each other
So what are we willing to do?

[Hook: MC Jin]
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes
But ultimately I rely on His grace
(and what about what about you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes in the end gota rely on your faith

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
You gotta really focus for you goal to be seen
You either want it or you don't there's no in-between
Never let no man poke a hole in your dream
Usually it be the ones that be low in esteem
I don't succumb to it in fact I'm numb to it
I face it then embrace it and never run from it
I get it all they're tryin' to do is slow my momentum
So I'll be stuck where they at but I don't hold it against 'em
The ladder of maturity I'm climbin' higher and higher
Certainly don't expect to see me fight fire with fire
If it's in His will there's nothin' that can't be done
They'll try to pull you under but trust that you'll overcome

[Bridge: MC Jin]
See the reality is you're gonna keep running into people
That tell you "you can't do this, you can't do that"
So here's my challenge
What are you willing to do to prove them wrong?

[Hook: MC Jin]
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes (yes I will)
I will do whatever it takes
But ultimately I rely on His grace
(and what about what about you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes (would you would you)
Would you do whatever it takes in the end gota rely on your faith
