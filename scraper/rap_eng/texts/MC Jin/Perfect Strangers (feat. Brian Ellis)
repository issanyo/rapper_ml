(Intro:)
Listen, I know we strangers and all
I mean, I see you all the time
But I never say a thing to you
Uhh, let's go

Gotta get the nerve to talk to you
Show you everything that we can do
All I really need is one more chance
Promise I won't let you down

(Verse 1:)
I seen you store, seen you at the flicks
Seen you at the mall, shopping some kicks
I even know you rock a size 5 in ladies
But I don't know your first name, that's crazy
And this the part that I find whack
We never even made eye contact
So next time I'mma make sure when we cross paths
I'mma look you in the eyes and hope you look back
Go in my book bag, pull out my notepad, jot down my digits and tell you to hold that
But that's just me talking fly
I probably end up watching you walk on by

(Chorus: Bryan Ellis)
I see you everyday and I know every single way you move
Perfect strangers through and through
Gotta get the nerve to talk to you
Show you everything that we can do
All I really need is one more chance
Promise I won't let you down

(Verse 2:)
Day after day, same bus stop, you could find me in my spot
2:55 on the dot, she shows up at 3 O' clock
5 minutes you're on, so you know I
Can't wait to stand next to her, side by side
It's not like I say hi, I'm on some dumb shit
You know, standin there, playin with my thumb shit
I want to just say, how you doin miss
But my brain's like, know how I'm aimless
That don't make sense, I'mma keep it real
That's just how it is when you're head over heels

(Chorus: Bryan Ellis)
I see you everyday and I know every single way you move
Perfect strangers through and through
Gotta get the nerve to talk to you
Show you everything that we can do
All I really need is one more chance
Promise I won't let you down

(Verse 3:)
I feel like I've known you for forever and a day
Before you do, I know what you're gonna say
You're favorite color's green, the heat's you're favorite scene
You love milkshakes but you hate ice cream
Which are you, a gemini or a cancer
With that body you're probably an exotic dancer
I'm just playing, for all I know
You're a college student, GPA 4.0
So, I'mma come back to the real world
Don't tell myself that you're not even a real girl
Just a figment of my imagination
If yous was real, we'd be having conversations

(Chorus: Bryan Ellis)
I see you everyday and I know every single way you move
Perfect strangers through and through
Gotta get the nerve to talk to you
Show you everything that we can do
All I really need is one more chance
Promise I won't let you down
