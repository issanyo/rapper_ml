[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Let me tell you how this all came to be
I was sittin' diggin' in the word Matthew 23
I'm thinking this is it, finally victory
Then the Holy Spirit hit quick convicted me
Could it be it's just all hypocrisy
I'm a modern day pharisee quite possibly
Tell me whats the use if I know the law
But the true living God I never knew at all

[Hook]
I got to practice what I preach
It don't matter what I'm saying on these beats
In the church or when I'm on the streets
Tell me whats the use if I don't practice what I preach

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
If thats the case I should expect the worst
No surprise why the word would reject the church
I mean why would you respect my turf
If I don't comply myself and resect it first
Brothers and sisters in Christ this is a wake up call
To myself included I can relate to y'all
Right now is the time I got to start living it
The last thing I want to be is a hypocrite

[Hook]

[Verse 3: MC Jin]
Make no mistakes its a must that I be honest y'all
Whats in the dark shall come to light thats a promise y'all
I know what someone say it ain't no surprise to me "I ain't a Christian so none of this applies to me"
Indeed, that's why off and from the start
I sincerely pray THE LORD will soften up your heart
Until then beware of any false prophets
Vicious wolves disguised as sheep that look harmless
Don't be fooled before you follow suit
I mean really take a look and recognize them by their fruit
The good news is even as I'm writing this
I realize only faith brings forth righteousness
Yet I can't neglect how I live and behave
Cause faith without works will only end up in the grave
Right nows the time we got to start living it
The last the you want to be is a hypocrite

[Hook]

[Outro]
Come on put yours hands up if you got to stand
This hypocrisy its got to stop its time to man up
I said this hypocrisy its got to stop its time to its time to
Come on put yours hands up if you got to stand up
This hypocrisy its got to stop its time to man up
I said this hypocrisy its got to stop its time to time to

[Hook]
