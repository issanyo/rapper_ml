[Intro/Hook 2X]
Back by popular demand
Doin what?
Goin each and every place with a mic in my hand
Who are you?
Tha emcee letting you know what I'm about
(and every year I gain clout and my name sprouts)

[Verse 1]
Check it yeah
Give me 15 minutes an L and a knockin track
I'll stroll in the booth and bring hip hop back
Return it to the rightful owners
When I go off the top its potent so what I write's a bonus
I shatter mic's and all type of opponents
You nicer than me psyche got you hyped for a moment
Leader of the pack shouts to my mom thanks
Try to catch me if you can like Tom Hanks
Colabos I'm bettin at least a G
At least you get out ?? like your ?? getting released
A beast your supposed to be pissed
I eat so many rappers got 'em on my grocery list
Ferociously I spit gross mc's to bits
And pieces the closer you get degrees get higher and all
Then I'm passed out after the show cause I'm flyer than y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They can never impair my wisdom
60 inch plasma just so you can share my vision
The crowd favorite throw in the towel save it
My style consists of various wild flavors
I spit lines that linger on your taste buds
I'm paid in full you can check my pay stubs
Started with the basics, not a penny
Just a dream chased it like a shot of henny
I did it but they hate when you brag
So my fitted still says 7 5 8 on the
Tag
Same size smart as I appear
The award winner for the most humble artist of the year
For the record I don't rap I chat with rhythm
And studied the art of human magnetism
Yeah I left but I'm back wassup here to stack my bucks
The emcee and I'm back by what?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Slowly I'm growin my status
Known as the badest on this microphone apparatus
Half the atlas been blessed with my presence
Upon entrance entranced by my essence
Hotness the loch-ness lyricist
Quick take a photo to prove that I exist
I can't help it my ora's slick
I score with chicks on a regular
Got 'em screamin like horror flicks
The more I spit get the media hyped
I'm a star can't you see I'm that media hype
Lyrically anything less will be insifice
You ask me the fame got a fee and a price
We don't care they been knockin us
To see me it will take more than a pair of binoculars
I'm on top of the list when it comes to rockin the spot proper uhhh
