[Intro]
(Per-per-per-perspective)
Yea, it's a new beginning
Hip Hop, one two one two
The Emcee
Check

[Hook]
They say hip hop's falling apart
But that won't stop us from calling it art
Yea we gotta hold it down as a collective
And make sure that they see our (per-per-per-perspective)
They say hip hop's falling apart
But that won't stop us from calling it art
Yea we gotta hold it down as a collective
And make sure that they see our (per-per-per-perspective)

[Verse 1]
Hip Hop ain't the same it's a shame they closed Rawkus
Disappointing like the Knicks to New Yorkers
All I hear is a bunch of lames and shit talkers
Where's the Kanes, Rakims and Kris Parkers?
Real MC's, are damn near extinct
Last time I heard some shit was Built for
Cuban Linx
Just think, other than that, the rest of the shit stinks
Better work out the kinks before your ship sinks
Sip drinks, get crunk, shake your behind
That shit is cool but it don't stimulate your mind
Time to take it back on some '91 shit
The De La, Tribe, Native Tongues shit
Can't forget that Onyx "Throw Ya Gunz" shit
And of course you know you gotta knock that Pun shit
I come from a era where cats would just spit
Now after 2 bars I'm ready to press skip

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I represent the last of
The dope MC's, that would never pass up
Any opportunity to rip your ass up
Don't let your mans and your fans have you gassed up
You really not that nice, it ain't hard the first week to go gold
When your
Label can cop half of what's sold
You can have the top 10 billboard spots
Keep that, either way I'mma still get props
The Emcee ain't got the throne naw not today
But I'm only bout 5 or 6 slots away, uh huh
I am the source being I'm that nice
Nas should've more than 3 and a half mics
Keep my craft tight, I know I can
No hit singles but I got die-hard fans
My instincts got me using the pen's ink
Not in a boy band but my flow is in sync

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On Golden Child tracks I'm at ease
To get my point across just like a trapeze
Stations charging flat fees
To get in rotation, you could put that in quotation
I said it, must be genetic
On the mic never bite my tongue
Give my pops all the credit
Corporate America can kiss my ass now
All they wanna do is milk the cash cow
Could care less if we end up deceased or in jail
Long as there's an increase in sales
I'm not a rap analyst, just a fan of this
Real hip hop from NY to Los Angeles
Matter fact, any longitude or latitude
Where they show the pioneers gratitude
And that's the attitude that seems most effective
But yo, that's just my perspective

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yea yea
The Emcee got (per-per-per-perspective)
Golden Child got (per-per-per-perspective)
Kamel got (per-per-per-perspective)
Get your own (per-per-per-perspective)
