[Verse 1: MC Jin]
I used to call the shots thought I was the boss
Only found my way when I realized that I was lost
The price I paid couldn't cover what it cost
Cause none of it compares to what He suffered on the cross
Picture His hands and feet both covered in blood
Just so you and me could be covered with love
He never needed us but we always needed Him
Jesus was crucified to redeem us of our sins
Yet I still stray from His love that's why it's killing me
Knowing that the Son of God died for me willingly
What a sacrifice never will you see greater
So I'll do anything to glorify my Lord and Savior
Now they crucify me too I guess it's human nature
But I believe in love I don't believe in haters
You can crucify me too please do me the favor
I still believe in love I don't believe in haters

[Hook: MC Jin & Chris Belmont]
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
I throw my hands up for the King
AY AY AY AY
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
Through all my joyful sufferings
AY AY AY AY

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
To all my brothers and sisters that are facing trials
I encourage you to be joyful face it with smiles
In your darkest hour the light will give you vision
Let the world see your lamp make sure it's not hidden
Life is a test and a trust whatever your decision
Time to bury the lies now that the Truth has risen
It's a sure thing no it's not a gamble
Cause He'll never let you deal with more than you can handle
Sometimes you might pray and the answer is a no
You need to understand that's just a chance for you to grow
Every obstacle you face brings you closer to His grace
Runnin' full speed ahead yeah it's suppose to be a race
Gotta have endurance if you wanna hit the finish line
When you feel like fallin' thats when you should begin to climb
Hold tight I promise in the end you're doin' fine
Cause in our weakness is when His strength can truly shine

[Hook: MC Jin & Chris Belmont]
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
I throw my hands up for the King
AY AY AY AY
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
Through all my joyful sufferings
AY AY AY AY

[Outro: MC Jin & Chris Belmont]
Yeah
I mean everytime I go through something difficult in life
I think about my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
And what He went through

The world will try to bring me down
But no matter what I will hold my ground
What they say and what they do
Won't change the fact that I will gladly suffer for You

The world will try to bring me down
But no matter what I will hold my ground
What they say and what they do
Won't change the fact that I will gladly suffer for You

Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
I throw my hands up for the King
AY AY AY AY
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
Through all my joyful sufferings
AY AY AY AY

Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
I throw my hands up for the King
AY AY AY AY
Lord knows that I been through some things
Still I rejoice and yes I sing
Through all my joyful sufferings
AY AY AY AY
