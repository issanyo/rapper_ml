[Verse 1: MC Jin]
I know what you're thinkin' man this track is tough
I'm just trying to get my rhyme on thats whats up
Where you been Jin oh you ain't know
Find me in the studio right next to the take out menus and plastic cups
Working on these records hoping to expand my reach
Goin' in but keepin' it cool like a humblebeast
Propaganda told me make sure not to lose my teeth
I appreciate the gem that's why I chose this beat
No concept no hook I mean nothing
Just whatever comes to mind I guess that means something
You might not find my rhymes to be extraordinary
But is my testimony unique more than very
Cater to the world that was my mentality
Now I serve the Lord and I don't even want a salary
From secular to gospel that's quite a change of pace
It's just a testament and sign of God's amazing grace
Once the spirit takes over I can't contain my faith
I hear the whispers let's hope he ain't the same as Mase
I'm not one to talk gossip like a tabloid
But yes we are the same cause I use to be a bad boy
Until the Lord pulled me out the filth
Now I'm walking on the straight and narrow like a set of stilts
And that don't make me better than the next man at all
I'm still a sinner I pray You'll catch me when I fall

Okay okay
Uh uh
Yeah yeah yeah
I should walk out the booth and get a sip of water right now
But you know what
Let's go back in

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
Check, I could care less if the world chooses to acknowledge me
So good luck if you're waiting for an apology
I know I may not be an expert in theology
The Lord's grace doesn't only fall upon on the scholarly
I ain't doin' it big no I am not poppin'
I just opened the door when I heard God knockin'
I'm only pickin' up momentum no it's not stoppin'
Big up to Rapzilla shout out to Jah Rockin
They celebrated when the old me was laid to rest
Do I appreciate encouragement and prayers yes
Every last bit of it plus the fellowship
Left a legacy at Legacy can't wait to hit up Flavorfest
If you thought I vanished then you better do your research
Back on 106 rockin' a B3ARFRUIT t shirt
Speaking of bearing fruit God has been so kind to me
Allowing me to find work in the midst of this economy
Last year I married the woman of my dreams
This year we had a son wait this gotta be a dream
If not I must have died and this is a taste heaven
I'm still alive it's Jeremiah 29:11
I know You got plans for me and it's not to harm me
Even if the enemy attacks with an entire army
Go ahead and make your move if you think I'm bluffing
Yet without GOD I am nothing
