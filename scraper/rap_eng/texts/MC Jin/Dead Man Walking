Yo...

They want the punch line, battle raps,
I mean I had the title, you can have it back.

That line was said so egotistically,
I never gave it back, it got stripped from me.

Truly a blessing, what it did to me,
learn more lessons from defeat, then victory.

Like how to take a loss, humility,
what happened next though, the rest is history.

Glad they stopped me, it was going to my head,
Instead, I'm declaring that the cocky Jin is dead.

Don't put to much weight, on reputation and face,
expect to get let down, when expectations are great.

They use to accuse me, of relying on my race,
what they gone say now, I'm relying on my faith?

See that's fine with me, I was designed to be,
I kill my old self, who wants to die with me?


[HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)


[MC Jin]

Yo...

They want the party, getting money reps,
I had fun with that, but I'm done with that.

See I ain't opposed, to having a good time,
but what I compose now, are more then just good lines.

I use to dream, of getting five mics,
now every sixteen, I'm praying that you find Christ.

For the cheese, on the dotting line... I would've signed twice,
that's what I get, for following three blind mice...

Desperation, it was going to my head,
instead, I declare that paper chasing Jin is dead.

Seeking riches, I let it measure what I'm worth,
wasting time.. storing up, treasures here on earth.

Only to be destroyed, I can't fake the image,
so I'm prepared to see my fan base diminished.

See that's fine with me, I was designed to be,
I killed my old self, who wants to die with me?

[HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)

Five years ago, I met Jin for the first time,
we crossed paths, like church signs.

I was plotting on my bible,
suddenly, I'm shaking hands with my idol.

Three years later, me and Jin cooking tracks up in the stew,
cooking up tracks, boy it feel good.

Shot the video in Hong Kong, plus we did a show,
that's why I call him big bro...

I'm a dead man, dead man,
tryna to get ahead man.

Learning my ways,
I was listening to redman,

Back then, all I cared
was pouring up the remy.

Nowadays, I'm rapping with a purpose,
tryna make ends meet.

I don't know why, but sometimes feel empty,
I waiting at the gates, for entry.

Want to give it up,
but my luck won't let me.

I'm out with the old me,
so God don't tempt me.

(Yeah)

[END HOOK]
I know it don't make sense, due to recent events,
I ain't been the same since, I know you must be convinced.

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.

I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING)

I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin,
I put the old me in a coffin.
I put the old me in a coffin.


I'M SO ALIVE (STILL A DEAD MAN WALKING.....)
