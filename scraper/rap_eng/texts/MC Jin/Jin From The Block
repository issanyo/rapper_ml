They say I changed, I'm still the same

It's about time, I got my chance to shine
Droppin' advanced lines, designed, to enhance your mind
Most of these rappers say nothin' like pantomimes
Shorty stay tryin' to get up in these pants of mine
I move cautious
Like parallel parkin' Porsches
Smoke blunts the size of Olympic torches
Heads ain't seen me in a minute
And they think I lost it
They be like, "man Jin you shoulda signed to Rawkus"
Shoulda, coulda, woulda, that's all in the past
You saw me in the Eve video, havin' a blast
Not sure which way I'm headed now
Switched my styles more times than J-Lo's wedding vows
First it was Diddy, then the Spanish dude, you know the dancer
If things don't work out with Ben, then Jin's the answer
I just can't help it, I'm a slut
I know Jenny Gonzalas from the block
But she don't got the same butt
Yo chill Jin, yeah that's my name, what
Like my dick after a lap dance, I done came up
Don't let the whip and the fresh wardrobe decieve you
I'm still the same dude reppin' hard for my people
Rims clean, tints be illegal
Since Fast and the Furious 2, they callin' me Jin Diesel
Even though the flick doesn't come out for a while
2 weeks before that you find it on Canal
I'm doin' my thang, focused on money
But it just don't seem right like I'm focused on 20s
Haters steady tryin' to blow the smoke out my fuse
Don't wanna see me win, man they hopin' I'll lose
I'ma end up chokin' these dudes (why?)
Play though guys but they be pussies like fallopian tubes
Don't be mad cause I'm hot
I'm still, I'm still Jin from the block
You can find me in Chinatown a lot
I'm still, I'm still Jin from the block
Don't be mad cause I'm hot
I'm still, I'm still Jin from the block
You can find me in Chinatown a lot
I'm still, I'm still Jin from the block
