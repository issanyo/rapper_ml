[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Lord I thank You for Your time and how you show me favor
I know You're listenin' to each and every single prayer
Despite the fact I've wandered You still had my back
And I'll admit it's been a while since we've had a chat
It's not that I don't enjoy our intimate conversations
I've just been caught up in some things and now my mind is racin'
Overwhelmed by these situations that I'm facin'
Instead of seeking You I'm relyin' on replacements
In the end all I find is a sense of false security
When all along You're the One that's been securing me
Slowly coming to my senses I just need a moment
You're quick to come to my defense as I receive atonement
With that said to deny Christ would be absurd
My undivided attention is what You rightfully deserve
You see right through me so it's hard not to be real with You
Wish I could turn the world off and just be still with You

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Nothing in this world will ever take Your place
Or come between me and You
With everything I'm going through
I just gota keep it real with You
I wanna turn the world off and be still with You
Because I'm still with You
I don't wanna move or even lose another second here with You
I will be still

[Verse 2: MC Jin]
In this crazy world we live in it's no wonder life can get so hectic
Especially when you're making use of every second
The need to stay busy combined with the unexpected
The perfect recipe for precious things to be neglected
I'm talking 'bout the things we cherish and we love in life
For me it's many things but most of all my son and wife
Nothing gets more priority than the two of you
I dream about our future and the things that I can do with you
I know it gets tough time is just slipping away
When I'm walking out that door and we're wishing I could stay
Chance you might not understand yet but I wouldn't be suprised
If you did cause sometimes I see it in your eyes
Dont be sad daddy's just away he's not gone
There is difference I need you and Mommy to be strong
Ya'll see right through me so it's hard not to be real with you
Wish I could turn the world off and just be still with you

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Nothing in this world will ever take Your place
Or come between me and You
With everything I'm going through
I just gota keep it real with You
I wanna turn the world off and be still with You
Because I'm still with You
I don't wanna move or even lose another second here with You

[Bridge: Uncle Reece]
I will be still
I will not move from here
I will not be moved from here
Let's put the world on pause
We can put the world on pause
We can put the world on pause
We can put the world on pause
Yeah

[Hook: Uncle Reece]
Nothing in this world will ever take Your place
Or come between me and You
With everything I'm going through
I just gota keep it real with You
I wanna turn the world off and be still with You
Because I'm still with You
I don't wanna move or even lose another second here with You
I will be still
Oh
