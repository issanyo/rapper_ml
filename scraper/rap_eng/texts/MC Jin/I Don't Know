[Intro]
Yeah
Oh jun a ruff rider
What's going on?

[Chorus]
I don't know why everybody's talking bout me
Is he really gonna be a hot MC
Asking if my albums gonna flop
Wondering if I'm gonna hit n go up top
I don't know why this worlds got so much hate
If there was that much love it would all be great
But there ain't and its making me strong
If y'all real than you gonna be feeling this song

[Verse 1]
Since the last time you saw me on TV blazing MC's
My life turned around - did 180 degrees
There's a couple of key issues that i gotta address
Plus a lot of bullshit to get off my chest
Everybody's got opinions that they wanna contest
I listen to most of them and ignore the rest
Some confess that I'm hot
Some stress me a lot
Saying that I don't deserve all the success that I got
Is it me or does it seem like they obsess with my jock
Either that or they just jealous of my props
All it took was hard work and
Ask around who's nice and they'll mention my name
Is he the best in the game the question remains
Will he ship numbers or is he a one-hit wonder
Y'all can't talk about me, y'all don't know what I've been through
I just wanted to rap look what i got myself into

[Chorus]
I don't know why everybody's talking bout me
Is he really gonna be a hot MC
Asking if my albums gonna flop
Wondering if I'm gonna hit n go up top
I don't know why this worlds got so much hate
If there was that much love it would all be great
But there ain't and its making me strong
If y'all real than you gonna be feeling this song

[Verse 2]
Before I even dropped any material I had a lot of critics
What I gotta do to prove to y'all that I'm not a gimmick
Eager to check my numbers when my sales start to cash in
Seems like y'all want me to fail with a passion
My own people hating my eyes are deceiving me
Can it be, some of them don't even believe in me
Damn first you mad there ain't no Asian in the main street
No doubt
Now there is one you say hes sold out
Face it you don't hate the fact that I'm rhyming
You hate the fact that you ain't in the position that I'm in
I'm a pioneer it ain't no mystery
Look
I got my own chapter in the Hip Hop history book
Oh and by the way in case you didn't notice
All that hating your doing is keeping me focused
Besides hating is bad for your health
At the end of the day I'm still asking myself

[Chorus]
I don't know why everybody's talking bout me
Is he really gonna be a hot MC
Asking if my albums gonna flop
Wondering if I'm gonna hit n go up top
I don't know why this worlds got so much hate
If there was that much love it would all be great
But there ain't and its making me strong
If y'all real than you gonna be feeling this song

[Verse 3]
I can't explain what this game is putting me through
You wouldn't understand man put your foot in my shoe
Walk a mile - shit you couldn't even walk an inch
Same pace, that's all it takes for you to relate
It ain't about right or wrong
Be the same cats that love my freestyles and say I can't write a song
Plus he's signed to the R don't he run with thugs
What he gonna rap about now huh guns and drugs
Nope I'm just gonna do me
Witty cat plus I'm a true MC
I proved to be
Give the streets my music
I've paid my dues I got receipts to prove it
You can't refuse it if its hot its hot
Actually I'm flattered you say I sound like Marshall Mathers
I know Eminem but I'm not wack either
The only reason you compare me to him is cuz I'm not black neither

[Chorus]
I don't know why everybody's talking bout me
Is he really gonna be a hot MC
Asking if my albums gonna flop
Wondering if I'm gonna hit n go up top
I don't know why this worlds got so much hate
If there was that much love it would all be great
But there ain't and its making me strong
If y'all real than you gonna be feeling this song

[Outro]
Yeah haters y'all keep me going
Y'all keep me strong
I need y'all
I'd like to thank every person that ever hated on me
I don't know where id be without y'all
Shit I couldn't have wrote this song if it wasn't for y'all

[Chorus]
I don't know why everybody's talking bout me
Is he really gonna be a hot MC
Asking if my albums gonna flop
Wondering if I'm gonna hit n go up top
I don't know why this worlds got so much hate
If there was that much love it would all be great
But there ain't and its making me strong
If y'all real than you gonna be feeling this song
