[Verse 1: MC Jin]
Dear non believer
I know you're like not this again I can't relate to what you spittin' Jin
At least not the way a Christian can
That's how I know it's only by the grace of God that your listenin'
Truth be told I ain't sayin' nothin' new
Just my testimonial so you can hear my point of view
This ain't about religion need I remind
So when you say you ain't religious well neither am I
The commandments ain't just a set of rules its a set of tools
Use properly and gain life that you will never lose
Fear not God was plenty steps ahead of you
Sent His only son to die for your sins instead of you
This might be the definition of what crazy is
Tryin' to explain the gospel to an atheist
What's the confusion this is conviction
Ain't no denyin' it now God is my addiction
Some say His name and try to use it vain
Just know no matter what Jesus loves you the same
Although I know it's true at times I choose to bite my tongue
Cause enough self righteousness can leave a man numb
Thankful for my creator I place no one above Him
But I simply can't force you to love Him
My heart says to love you and not to play it safe
I'm thankful cause your non belief reaffirms my faith
Hey

[Outro: MC Jin]
Yes and I thank you for listening
That's what Crazy Love and Ridiculous Faith is about
Amen
