[Ya Boy:]
Hey mama
Ya Boy getting paid mama
Remember, it didn't use to be this way mama
But look, ya son driving Escalade's mama
And after them shows ya son getting laid mama
I don't know What It Is Mayb The Like Me
But Ive Been Suffering So Long Huh, The Shit Is Frightening
People Are Star Struck, Im Gettin Starbucks
But Last Year I Couldn't Afford Starbucks
I Went From Honda Cord To Driving Large Trucks
Didn't Really Have A Name I Couldn't Charge Much
Nigga's Overlookin The Bay But That Was Our Luck
Now I Got Sumthin To Say And They On Our Nuts
I Used To Hustle On The Block Sellin 10 Shots
And Now Im Tradin My Stocks At The Rim Shop
And The Shit Dont End No Its Not Stopping
Im In New York With Jin We Got The Set Popping

[Hook: Ya Boy (Jin)]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(Its Time For Me To Come Up) [x4]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(If You With Me Get Up)

[Jin:]
I Speak For The Mc's So You Can Understand Him
1 - 2 battles now they call me 100 Grand Jin
Accept The Fact That You Can't Win
Its A Done Deal Now That I Linked Up With Ya Boy In St Quin
You Know Cats Will Talk We Just Here To Get It Poppin
And Let The Bay Watch Like David Hasselhoff
Then Go Global With It Hit Your Part Of Town
But You Can't Reach The Sky If You Dont Start From The Ground
Can You Blame My Confidence?
In 4 Years I Rocked About 36 States And 5 Continents
Thats All On The Strenght Of My Flow
Only Suckers Who Measure Skills Based On The Land Of There Dough
I Represent The Graphieus Ask My Man Kay
He'll Tell You Right There Im Only 1 Hit Away
But You Never Know, Shit This Could Be The Song
Its Time To Come Up Ive Been Down So Long

[Hook: Ya Boy (Jin)]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(Its Time For Me To Come Up) [x4]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(If You With Me Get Up)

[Jin (Ya Boy):]
So If You With Me Out There Then Please Stand Up
(And If You Hustlin Work Then Put Your Grands Up)
But If You Get Locked And Put On A Stand Stuck
(Remember Snitchin Ain't Cool Dont Never Give Your Mans Up)
(And For My 9 To 5 Workin I Ain't Mad At You)
Single Baby Mothers That Gotta Be The Daddy Too
(This Is The Anthem For The Struggle In The Grind)
Its Jin
(Ya Boy)
Its About Time

[Hook: Ya Boy (Jin)]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(Its Time For Me To Come Up) [x4]
Ayy Ive Been Down So Long ,So Long, So Long(If You With Me Get Up)
