[Round 1: Danny Myers]
You been in God mode? fuck that, this nigga just tryna seem hard
I'll bring four in (foreign) pussy back like he tryna get a green card
These bars?
Forget it, in my waist is where the banger looms
Y'all seen how I trained X man, now I'm in Danja room?
The pain consumes, but I'm back with several enhancements
The .40 take out his ribs cause this Maryland man sinned (Marilyn Manson)
When yall hear them, it be a bunch of filler, see these niggas playin'
I throw sharp rounds off the gate like Ninja Gaiden!
You got beef in yo heart? Well bitch nigga you not alone
We move in on 'em with no agreement... that's a squatter home!
I'm a rider Zone, I'll find out where you be at and yo position homie
I do this, by having niggas tail (tell) you like they snitchin' on me!
The Smith is on me, you see in 2 years what I've accomplished?
Being from the West and killing the East is what I encompass!
I don't know where my mind went, I just know I'll commit the crime tense
All because of small words, I promise they'll never find prints
Before you would begin a verse, you used to have dinner first
Then three battles later, that gypsy hit you with the Thinner curse
Face a winner first, nigga you done ran into a freight train
It takes a big dog to show you you ain't great, Dan'!
The 8 bang, I'll catch em with his bitch, I'll let the kids observe
2 shots...they sink next to each other like "His" and "Hers"!
This the word, you no brother's keeper even through bloodshed
Well look at yo career, and look at yo brothers....nuff said!
A year ago, I was liable to send shells
But nowadays beef with me entails...
A coat hanger through ya stomach draggin out ya entrails
Then flying a jet over ya house releasing a cloud of Chem-trails
We got a problem please don't let me get near trey
I'll blow off a nigga ear and tongue over hearsay
If I flash it, I might as well kill you, I'm puttin lead in ya face
Cause even if I'm missing you I'm still catching a case
The beef is back, the heat'll clap til his meat detach
Choke em from behind with a shoe lace...
That's the sneak attack
I keep a strap, with these sub machines we ain't bogus
That extended gives us 70...to ours (72 hrs) like a 3-day notice! BarGod
Bitch I really hustle, I move zones, I've earned my splendor
We from the same the crew, but right now I gotta burn a member
Nigga God sent you here
But I was taught when you receive unsolicited mail you return to sender!
Remember, these young niggas can't rap with me
Cause I'm bout to turn 36 Zone...that's the key (ki)
I shoot up ya house, ya innocent mother be in a blood pool
Bullets be crackin the walls like a drug mule
Wait...Crack in the walls? Drug mule? It's hopeless you rookie
When you behind these bars you better have something dope in you pussy

Ya sources were right, I did say fuck My Brother's Keeper
Ima fuck yo bitch and when I'm done I'll let my brother keep her!
The snub'll reach ya, I'll walk up on you and fire 3 shots
The rounds of fire were mentioned in the Bible...I am Enoch!
I'm from Cali, but these bars register in other states
It's only right the DMV gave me another plate
I'm fuckin great, and you on the ground with this shit
Thank the Lord he don't got another round of this shit, yikes!

[Round 3: Danja Zone]
On the 7th day, God rested, think about that…cause I really want ya’ll to hear me out
Cause if you susceptible to sleepin, you susceptible to dreamin
So tell me…what you think Gods have nightmares about?
Now if you even think you know, I want you to answer me then
And if you don’t it’s cool, but in a minute, I’ma ask you again
For now, I’m back in attack mode
Some asshole, said I look like dude from Martin, which is factz though
Should recognize the KING in the middle, of speakin in riddles
Yea nigga, I’m Nat Cole!
Act bold, the gauge’ll lift him
Fried a grape, a month later, Danja back in California raisin niggas
Errythang I say is vicious, my nina clap wit no legs
But my Dame kicks, like I’m bringin back the Pro Keds
You ain’t better than Ooops, Day, J, Magic, Jones, Ced
That's Nitty, Kannon, 4-0, Trez
You in the, lineup so far down, we can’t see you like B. Magic’s fo’head
That's why we did this in ya city
Danja, made ya, eulogy, in a gated community
And he still defenseless against me!
But since we, gon begin there nucka
It's apparent I been killin…I’ll make ya men end EZ like a Menendez brova
You faggot you
Not street enough for this avenue
Gut punches, hand ova his stomach
Losin is absolute!
To rap wit you, is overkill
Give him a can it could show who real
Wantin wreck, A broken grill’ll give him that total feel
Thinkin bein hood, in genetics, dese punchez’ll fuck up a nigga motor skills
No forreal, won’t switch, I’ma use the same
Fist, a contusion came
Then I’ma bring it back like a boomerang
Bruise him, the abuse and pain,’ll look like he tried, to kiss the side, of a moving train
Fuck who you paid, I can’t control ya money
But that alone shows, you can’t compare ya lil hungry, to 3rd world country
Trust me, my hunger been, from 1 to 10, a hunnid den
They think I suck my stomach in
They can’t grasp the bars, I get across, I punch within, a jungle gym
Try to write, like I write, you might, just lose a fuckin limb
It’s tough findin, Blood Diamonds, so some content, with Jungle Gems
Kids, you got a bunch of them
Don’t wanna see them? Keep mugging den
A dome shot’ll make it hard to thank, and wonder when
Any nigga that stare’ll (sterile), draw a blank, can’t fuckin' leave or see their son (seed a son) again
I'm gunnin them, I mean what else is there to talk about?
Knew we'd meet, he'd freeze up before cooking, maybe you shoulda thought (thawed) this out
If there was even a slight chance of doubt
So let me ask you again what do Gods have nightmares about?
The answer is terrorist attacks if I'm not mistaken
For a rack (Iraq) he fucked, Danja's code name Saddam-a natrix
So for the sake of conversation, why would you bring the BarGod to the spawn of Satan
The abomination, next time you contemplating on that line don't ever cross that
And before you even mention a nigga, say where your bars at?
Off with his head, make some noise!
