Sometimes I be thinking to myself, its like it could all be over in the blink
Of an eye. So I cherish everyday of my life, every minute...matter fact every
Second

It ain't hard to imagine the shows over only curtains is left
Cause in this world the only thing certain is death
Til' my last breath breathed it makes no sense to be torn
Cause every seed sent to be born we eventually mourn
Vent through these songs fuel in my tank
Couldn't see me going out unless I fill in the blanks
You could call me pessimistic for facin the facts
Never will I have regrets of ever wastin a track
The only time I can escape and relax forget my sins
Then reality sets in
Searchin for light haunted by ominous tendencies
While Im in the dark fightin anonymous enemies
If I do so become a memory I
Wanna give some last words to remember me by
So I roll it light it smoke it think it write it
Step in the booth recite it and pray that you like it

[Chorus]
I might not see tomorrow so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write
Tomorrow ain't promised so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write

Apparently this is where the insanity ends
Bid farewell to my parents family and friends
Tell 'em I loved 'em and just to be proud when its done
One day we'll reunite beyond the clouds and the sun
When ya time arrives theres no where you can run
Hide duck dodge just be prepared when it comes
Life is like a vacation maximize ya stay
Gota enjoy it even when the skies are gray
Sometimes I wonder are we disguised this way
Like if I left would it be grief and sighs today
A few "i miss you" cards begging for new means
Then its right back to your regular routine
See all I ever asked was to be heard and accepted
Never thought about the many lives I effected
But now the plot thickens cause the clocks tickin'
Prolly won't be 'til I perish 'til my musics cherished

I might not see tomorrow so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write
Tomorrow ain't promised so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write

This the last lap last chance to be respected
Honestly I lasted longer than they expected
See Im the last of my breed
Copped a twenty so this blunts the last of the weed
They say "he who laughs last shall laugh hardest"
But if you laugh first you still laughin regardless
At the bar last call for alcohol
I wish I wasn't sober that's all for slackin' off
Top five dead and alive that could exist
Be content even if I made it last on the list
Witness how Im hurtin these hot beats
So even if Im last Im certainly not least
Get up no time to sit in your seat
Here the ink hittin the sheet then the vocals grippin the beat
I mean every word from the last to the first line
So make it last like you hearin it for the first time

[Chorus]x2
I might not see tomorrow so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write
Tomorrow ain't promised so its on tonight
Gota make sure its something that they gone' recite
Imma say what I say whether Im wrong or right
Cause this just might be the last song I write
