Chorus 2x: (Kanye)
I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with

Verse 1:
Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West
Mid that is, so basically the Chi, M.I. is up in the mix
We in the game now, it makes perfect sense
The kid that dropped outta college, the other never went
We take turns doing our one, two's and yes yes yalls
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast yall
Mr. West what do you think is the best?
(Take em backstage, get aquainted that's what I suggest dawg)
When it coming to spittin G, I'm one of the best yall
She look goods, smell clean and she had fresh draws
Naw, that's too good to be
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me, no!

Chorus 2x: (Kanye)
I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with

Verse 2:
I got a.. way with words, I use words in ways
I convince birds to come out they cage and play
Polly want a Gucci parka, ma what did you say?
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today (hey)
But anyway though, she got it on smash like mashed potatoes
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo
Lay low, got play-doh, stash the payroll
Ain't no credit card, spendin cash on Rodeo
And me, I'm at the Slausson Swap Meet
Lookin for a pair of air 1 and white tee
She want champagne, I got Sisco and Kool-Aid
Why go to the movies, let's watch the bootleg

Chorus 2x: (Kanye)
I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with

Verse 3:
Girl I don't wear Prada, never met Gucci
Or wore Ver-sake (Versace), all is too boozie
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton
But if I see a L and a V, I'd think that its on
That's what my old chick used to clash with me
(Jin, why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)
Actually, you should be happy I purchased that
I take this as a sign, you don't want the matching hat
Huh, I'm too gutter, you more Parkay with yours
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame
I got a new significant other cause plans change

Chorus 2x: (Kanye)
I gota love that's better then
You ever was, you've never been
No good for me, I guess I was
Just way too hood for you to be with
