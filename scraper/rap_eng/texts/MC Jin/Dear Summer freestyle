Nowadays if you don’t go platinum or gold they call you a flop
I’ll be happy if I sell a hundred thou when I drop
Took the stupid route first but the knowledge I got
Told me independents are makin 4 dollars a pop
And less hands in the pot equal bigger amount of funds
You ain't gotta be a math wiz to figure out the sum
True indeed I realize the grind’s a lot tougher
But yo I can’t see me working at Blockbuster
Or serving pasta at the Olive Garden
Taking orders at Red Lobsters I beg your pardon
No disrespect to the waiters service but
That’s not me I was born with a greater purpose
I walk the earth's surface searching for souls
That feel worthless give ‘em salvation thru
These verses
My motivation has never been fame or fortune
I’m just like you dealing with my pain in portions
What I thought was a vision became distortion
Adopted my own style the same as orphans
I came to a fork in the road but that’s life
Where backstabbers will get ya with ya own knife
You only live once so never think twice
Unless its to consider if it's really worth the price
Bare with me if you’ve made it this far that was 24
There's only 20 more bars
Of reality that’s undeniable only the truth I’m
Supplying you never know who you could be lying to
So I make it a habit to be elaborate
Kick the facts that’s genuine like the finest fabric
I gota be hard on myself
Doing this beat justice similar to Mr. Carter himself
Our positions are different his career is at its peak
Chairman of the Board I’m still waiting for a seat
Don’t get it twisted I ain't here for no hand out
Its crowded in the game so I gotta stand out
A million artists freestyling on beats I prolly
Do one let ya'll wait for the album release
You can call it what you want I’m far from being cocky
I’m just trying to sell my 100,000 copies
Sit back relax scratching my crotch
While you chasing majors I might cash in with Koch
Im trying to teach these kids bout supply and demand
Don’t be surprised your favorite rappers buying his fans
Bottom line my music ain't for the simple mind
So if you an idiot keep ya 12.99
