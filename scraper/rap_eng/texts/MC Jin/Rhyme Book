It started with a rhyme book in the sixth grade
The main objective was not to get paid
Always knew things would turn out this way
Center of attention, bright lights, the big stage
Due to my complexion they kept a eye on me
Shoulda did the math earlier, now that's irony
No need for comparing stats
Question is would they have cared if I was black?
Can't lie, chose a narrow path
You can recognize a pioneer by the arrows in his back
The name Jin synonymous with spittin'
I kicked down doors, all my big fans won't tell you different
Now I got a fam to feed, though
Need that real bread, not that wheat toast
Put it all on the line like a free throw
And when the beat drop, I'm going beast mode
The fire I spit, you would think I lit a matchstick
Far from a freshman, I don't belong on that list
I used my words to infect your students like the bird flu
The school nurse too, that's how you make a class sick
So-called rappers got me the least bit impressed
I put 'em in a crunch like tryin' to put ya knees to ya chest
And while y'all searching for the keys to success
I just pick the locks, we are the streets in the flesh
I been the underdog but never unprepared
Stop saying your joint bangs, I've had it up to here
Cleaning out my attic, ain't got it all upstairs
Ya crew is straight outta Minecraft, just a bunch of squares
I'm a glimpse of greatness, my potential is enormous
Check the skills I display, this is a peek of my performance
Denzel in Training Day, '96 Jordan fade-away
After guzzlin' two gallons of Gatorade
Safe to say I paved the way for a lot of up-and-comers
The industry is Sudoku, they just lookin' at the numbers
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how
I keep from goin' under, keep from goin' under
The original message was loud and clear, somewhere
Along the way it got cloudy and nearly disappeared
All you need now is a laptop and some beats from the net
I plugged my mic into my boombox
With the dual cassette decks
Hip-hop is for the youth, that's who it truly is serving
Only right to pass the torch and continue the burning
Know where you came from, that's the root of the sermon
'Cause I bet LeBron can you tell you who's Julius Erving
When Kool Herc planted the seed at Sedgewick and Cedar
You think he knew that he'd be giving birth to future leaders
My rhyme book was more than just a place to write lyrics
Nobody's listening but I knew every page would hear it
I knew every page would hear it
I knew every page would hear it
My rhyme book was more than just a place to write lyrics
Nobody's listening but I knew every page would hear it
