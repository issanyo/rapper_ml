[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 1]
I still remember those nights just layin’ in bed
Hands behind my head starin’ at the ceilin’
Wide awake dreamin’
Just to make sure
I’m alive not dead
Eyes bloodshot red
All I ever wanted was to change my life with this pen
It was bound to happen
Felt it in the pit of my stomach I just ain’t know when
So I kept on pushin’ kept on climbin’
It’s not like I had options
I was crushed
I was let down
But I’ve come too far to think about stoppin’
These opportunities might just ruin me
Maybe my time has come and gone
No point in dwellin’ on what’s be- yond my control
I got no choice but to carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for

[Verse 2]
Seems like a nice life right
Center stage well take a peek at what’s behind the curtains
Cause when the bright lights burn out it turns out
Blessings are burdens
I ain’t complainin’
I’m just sayin’ can I vent some of my frustrations
Being Christian
Being Asian
Trying to live up to your expectations
I mean it’s one thing to think you know me
Give me space though you dont own me
Why is it always
In the most crowded places I feel the most lonely
The load is heavy
My shoulders ready
In my weakness He is strong
I close my eyes and pray see the cross was carried so I gotta carry on

[Chorus]
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
I have carried on so long I can’t recall
How I’ve come this far and what it all was for
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on
Before you run gotta walk before you walk gotta crawl
Carry on
Carry on
Before you fly gotta fall before you fly gotta fall
Carry on
Carry on
