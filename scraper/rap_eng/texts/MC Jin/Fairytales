[Chorus]
Fairty tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairty tales are dust but I
I believe in us

[Verse 1]
Yo, picture me 23
Whole life in front of me
Have you seen
How to be a player
Bill Belamy
That was me
Just kiddin’
Maybe not
To the same extreme
Naw
Had a few ladies on the team we first met in PR
It was cool
Can’t say we saw sparks fly second chance in NY
Killed my set
Got off the stage
A superstar in the flesh
Her demeanor though
Far from impressed
Now usually
My game is on point
When I’m in action
Can’t lie
Her lack of interest
Was quite attractive obviously she was not a fan
As the convo continued
Our fairy tale began

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairy tales are dust but I
I believe in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us

[Verse 2]
I’m so traditional
First date
Unforgettable
Two adults
Watchin’ The Incredibles
Every weekend it was movie and a dinner
If it ain’t broke
Don’t fix it
Knew I had a winner
When it came to my career
She always had my back
Never abandoned ship she was Rose I was Jack
When the call came from Hong Kong
We were unprepared
Rackin’ up miles like Clooney things were up in the air
We were literally on opposite sides of the earth
While she was puttin’ on her PJs
I was gettin up for work
Somehow we made it work
But not with ease
She turned a boy into a man and so I got on bended knees

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us

[Verse 3]
We tied the knot just a few years ago
Where?
In Puerto Rico
Hooo!
Beachside
Kept it low-key
Maybe you ain’t get the news
Time flies
Chance just entered his terrific twos
I’m married with children
A feelin’ I can’t explain
I guess it’s like scoring four touchdowns in one game
Things ain’t perfect
We fight and fuss like every couple does
But I’m glad I have a partner
When it’s time to knuckle up
From the heart she’s more than just my wife
She’s my best friend my worst critic
When it’s dark she’s my source of light
And everyday is the start of a new chapter
As they lived happily ever after
Yeah

[Chorus]
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe in us fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
Fairy tales are dust
But I, I believe (I believe, I believe) in us
