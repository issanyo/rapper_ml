[Verse 1: Ne-Yo]
Something like a stranger
Long time, no see
I've been in a film or two
But it's you that's acting Hollywood lately
I've been watching from a distance
Yeah, you poppin' in your snaps and on IG
See you livin' life but girl it's been a minute
Since you checked up on me

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Oh, oh, oh
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to not hit my phone
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to up and get gone
It ain't like you to not pick up when I call you
It ain't like you to just not be home
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
Tell me why you gotta be so, be so cold

[Verse 2: Problem]
Something like a stranger
Long time, no see
It's been hard to find you lately
Like we playing hide and go seek
I can read the signs, baby
I think you found another me
But that could never be, baby
But it seemin' like you don't agree (damn)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Oh, oh, oh
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to not hit my phone
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to up and get gon'
It ain't like you to not pick up when I call you
It ain't like you to just not be home
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
Tell me why you gotta be so, be so cold

[Verse 3: Terrace Martin]
Playing games is not the things I do (no, no, no)
It could be just me and you (yes, yes, yes, yea yea)
Notice how you treat me
Disrespect is what you do to me
Tables always turn
But for now I'm learning

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Oh, oh, oh
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to not hit my phone
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
It ain't like you to up and get gon'
It ain't like you to not pick up when I call you
It ain't like you to just not be home
It ain't like you to be so cold on a nigga
Tell me why you gotta be so, be so cold
