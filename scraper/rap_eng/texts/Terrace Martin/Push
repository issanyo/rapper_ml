[Verse 1]
People… we need to come together now
Confusion all over the world, just look around
Open your doors and your windows now
Cause the sun is going down on you
It’s starting to lose its shine

[Bridge]
But like the flowers need the rain
Just like seasons change
Go as far as you can and just PUSH

[Hook]
Push (8x)

[Verse 2]
People come and people go
Caught in a breeze
Can’t find no direction and no stability
Said it would be nice if we could all just get along
Like the hummingbird singing her song
Something’s in the air, we need more humility to cause we don’t even care

[Bridge]
But like the flowers need the rain
Just like seasons change
Go as far as you can and just PUSH

[Hook]
Push (8x)

[Bridge 2]
I don’t understand
The purpose of dividing lines
Look inside of your hands; you’ll see it’s the same
2
They can say what they like
Nobody cares who is wrong or right
The fact is that you’re my brother and that will never change
3
Don’t you want to be free
Like the leaves falling from the trees
There’s no difference between you and me so just……PUSH
C’mon now
Break down
Keep on moving, Keep on moving, Keep on moving, Keep on moving
Keep on moving, Keep on moving, Keep on moving, Keep on moving
Adlib growl: ayeeeeeeeyayeeeeyayeeee Yaaaaaaaaaah
You got to push (if you wanna grow)
You got to move (if you wanna grow)
You got to love, love, love (if you wanna grow)
You got to push (if you wanna grow)
You got to move, move, move, move, move, move, moooooooove

[Bridge]
But like the flowers need the rain
Just like seasons change
Go as far as you can and just PUSH

[Hook]
Push (8x)
