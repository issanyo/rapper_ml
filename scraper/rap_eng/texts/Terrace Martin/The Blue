[Chorus: Buddy]
I wasn't lookin' for a lova
But I found you (ooh)
I didn't wanna feel the way I do (the way I do)
But I still do (ooh)
Baby, you
Came out of the blue
Darling, you
Came out of the blue

[Refrain: Buddy]
Ooh, Everybody call ya mama, call ya daddy
We about to get it started in this mothafucka
Hey, tell 'em bring anotha bottle of the Henny
And a bottle of Moscato in this mothafucka

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Hey, ooh baby you caught me off guard
I never had a love quite like your's
And it's hittin' me down in my core
First I had doubts, now I'm sure
Yeah, and I never thought that it'd be like this before
You're the one I adore
Let me love you some more

[Chorus: Buddy]
I feel the magic when I'm kissin' you
This is somethin' new
(Ooh) I'm thinkin' back on how I first met you (first met you)
I don't have a clue
(Ooh) Baby, you
Came out of the blue
Darling, you
Came out of the blue

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
The sky is blue and I am too
I'm eyein' you
I wanna be inside of you
The way ya dance, take a chance and let me talk
And let me get ya higher, boo
My buddy, way too cool
Lil' cutty, get a shot of Moscato and lil' mama get slutty
On the real though
Let me tell ya how I feel though
She ain't fuckin' wit' no weirdo
So back the fuck up out my face
Straight out the bottle, I don't need no chase
I wanna freak witchu
For a week or two
Surprise, open ya eyes, peek-a-boo

[Chorus: Buddy]
I wasn't lookin' for a lova
But I found you (ooh)
I didn't wanna feel the way I do (the way I do)
But I still do (ooh)
Baby, you
Came out of the blue
Darling, you
Came out of the blue

[Refrain: Buddy]
Ooh, Everybody call ya mama, call ya daddy
We about to get it started in this mothafucka
Hey, tell 'em bring anotha bottle of the Henny
And a bottle of Moscato in this mothafucka
Ooh, Everybody call ya mama, call ya daddy
We about to get it started in this mothafucka
Hey, tell 'em bring anotha bottle of the Henny
And a bottle of Moscato in this mothafucka
