[Hook: Tiffany Gouche]
Before you decide to leave it behind
Once, twice, go
You're moving too fast and you can't rewind
Once, twice, go

[Verse 1]
It's a new era
Two steps ahead, and I'm ready for whatever
Life ain't easy, I took a few fair ones
Move in silence, my legacy is making sure that my beats
And my heart's in sync, doing me is really all I can do
The elephant in the room, either you're with me or not
Friend or foe, really, they be hard to spot
I play to win, why ask "why?"
It's about the element of surprise
Old soul, I could show you right
Black, white, or even gray, what would you decide?
But, yo, people walk around with their high hopes
Head in the sky, living life with their eyes closed
Remember, you could stop but time won't wait
So if you ain't got a vision, what you here for?
Momma said, "Just pray, and be patient"
Man, I'm just sayin'

[Hook: Tiffany Gouche]
Before you decide to leave it behind
Once, twice, go
You're moving too fast and you can't rewind
Once, twice, go

[Verse 2: Punch]
No rear-view mirrors, no recollection of scars
I'm stearing clear of all my flaws
I don't even wanna remember
Just give me space, I'll be gone 'til November
Forever young, a born sinner
I wish Mike was here, so he could see [?]
Unfold before my eyes, I'm tryna fight back tears
Bittersweet memories, mixing iced tea and Hennessy
Lord, protect my enemies
Which is me, I'm dyin' to find a proper energy
I need a direct current, what-if's constantly reoccurring
My 3 chords can't fold, I'm just reaffirming

[Hook: Tiffany Gouche]
Before you decide to leave it behind
Once, twice, go
You're moving too fast and you can't rewind
Once, twice, go

[Verse 3: Terrace Martin]
Me no pick up the phone
Can you blame me, call me crazy?
Man, just leave me alone
Peace of mind is needed
Why you interrupting my zone?
Homie, can't disrespect my business
And my children with your negative tone
It's principles, cause I don't wanna have to pick up the chrome
So chill, and let's keep it cool
I be doin' me, and you do you
Opportunity knocks, so don't miss a queue
How you executin' your mission while you watching the tube?
Fool, slackin' on your hustle
Can't be mad, man, it's all on you
Real talk, no denying the truth
Got my city on lock, homie, that's the key
Do my mic' sounds nice
Check, one... two... three... Chord... Fold

[Hook: Tiffany Gouche]
Before you decide to leave it behind
Once, twice, go
You're moving too fast and you can't rewind
Once, twice, go

Hidden Track: "Can't Help It (Michael Jackson Tribute)"

[Verse 1]
Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

[Verse 2]
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I cannot help but love you
It is getting better all the time

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

[Verse 3]
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles in your eyes

[Verse 4]
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I am so glad I found you, girl
You are an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I am so glad I found you, girl
You are an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
