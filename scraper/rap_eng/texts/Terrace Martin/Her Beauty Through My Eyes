[Verse: Pharoahe Monch]
Left a couple of bars open for you, that's how much
I bought the bar, left it open so we can chill in the cut
Cut, not meaning the end of the scene
But in the cut, 'cause I'm not really into the scene, haha
Internet connection would probably be the meme
We connected intellectually but her body was mean
And she like West Coast, Maad Circle, and Ice Cube
Glenlivet with one circular ice cube
She said, "My advice to you since you're a polite nice dude
Is candlelight to put me in the right mood for night moods
And tight grooves that might move me
Like the circle of life to write to, I like you
And this is intimate, sensual, it's beautiful
But I'm just hoping that the sentiment is mutual

[Keyon Harrold]
She is just what I seek
Captivating, alluring, unique
The next 40 years is right in front of me
Mesmerized by her eyes
Two galaxies, they take me in deep
She's a queen
One eternity is not enough for me
Her beauty through my eyes
Eyes, eyes
Her beauty through my eyes
She defines what beauty is
With no regrets, I connect
