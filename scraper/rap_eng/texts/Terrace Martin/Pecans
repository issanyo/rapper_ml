[Intro: Smino]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Smino]
We cut like apple pie, uh, My lil' papaya
Make me wanna Paypal ya, fly ya lil ass to me
Aw yeah yeah, R.S.V.P
I got that thang acquired, make ya sing
A Choir, quiet just riding, now she bussin' Pe-cay-ans.. Pecans
Porsche Cayenne, interior cayenne
Hands diligent, did it for the defiant
And niggas tryin', tryin' with no finance, cut from the finest
The other day my cuzzo hit my phone
Said he just hit a lick so good I'm like my nigga, pause
He laugh and say for real dirty I just wanna ball yeah that my dawg
He in a jam until Cruella free us all
But never forget them days no gas hop out and push the car
And never forget the wages they payin' Ma
I'll never forget the way they try and take away the arts from the heart yeah, yo start, yeah the north side
Sativa burn smoother than a Porsche ride
Plus I'm off that chocolate water, lit up like a Porsche light
Tryna dodge the pork lights
WOOWOO state troop SHOOSHOO black youth its on the news Momma still gotta get interviewed, Fox ratings boost, I stopped paying dues, cuz I'm like bitch I'm payin' who.. just sayin'
I owe it all {?} lied to my pops niggas got to the guap till I walked And felt the crunch in my socks
Now I think about it, shit, I had one pair of socks
Now I'm on beaches with these bitches
Got me like, fuck wearing socks
I'm a artiste, I'm sensitive, like ice on tea out the pot
I cook it up, I'm nice and seasoned, work from spring to July
I'm never fatiguing, give me a reason, I get beat in the clock
I'm loving my youth I got a sweet tooth I got you too for you

[hook: Smino]
We cut like apple pie, uh, My lil' papaya
Make me wanna Paypal ya, fly ya lil ass to me
Aw yeah yeah, R.S.V.P

I'm off the brownie, you stumbling baby
You probably think I'm the shit
