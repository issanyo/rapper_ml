[Verse 1]
Lets spend this day together
Loving each other
Lets been seen together
Loving each other

[Chorus]
All we have is love and time
I'll make your plate and you'll make mine
All we do is laugh and talk
Together
I just want to be together
Forever with you(x3)
I just want to be together
Forever with you
Together
Forever with you

[Verse 2]
Your heart, your mind, your body and soul
There is no place i'd rather go
Or be
I'm here for you
Nothing else i'd want to do
(I said nothing else i'd rather do)

[Chorus]


[Outro]
I just want to play for you
Baby, can I play for you?
Forever with you(x3)
I just want to be together
Forever with you
Together
Forever with you(repeated)
