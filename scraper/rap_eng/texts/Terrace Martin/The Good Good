[Verse 1]
Days like these are days I love
Runnin round going nowhere
Glad I get to steal all your time
Smilin cuz I know that I’m the one that makes you smile
Love the way you say my name
And how you laugh at all the stupid things I say
It’s all lovin`, no hate
Hangin with you while you're hangin`, hangin` on my arm (And I like it)
Your hand on my back while we drivin`, drivin` in my car (And I like it)

[Chorus]
This is the good, good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good, good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong going strong
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Anytime I’m feeling alone
There’ll be a text from you on my phone
Just to say you’re thinking of me
And when we are apart I know it’s only me you see
Love the way you have my back
And how when I make no sense
You still understand
When nobody else can
Hangin with you when you're hangin hangin on my arm (And I like it)
Your hand on my hand while we kissin kissin in the dark (And I like it)

[Chorus]
This is the good, good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good, good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong going strong
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)

[Bridge]
All this love
Is the best drug there could ever be
And I get high on you and me
Anyone can see
This is the good, good

[Chorus]
This is the good, good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good, good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong going strong
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)
This is the good, good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good, good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong going strong
Gotta keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it going on (yeah)

[Outro]
This is the good, good
This is what people look all their lives to find
And baby we found it
Right on time
This is the good, good
And now that we got it
We gotta keep it going strong keep it strong
Keep it keep it goin` on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin` on (yeah)
Keep it strong keep it keep it goin` on (yeah)
This is the good, good
