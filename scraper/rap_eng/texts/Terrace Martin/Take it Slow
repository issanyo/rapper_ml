[Intro: Rapsody]
Slowly, baby
Take my time to get to know you, baby, baby
Hold me baby
I'll wait however long to hold you baby

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
Dancing at the party
Don't slow down, hold my body
Hold my hand, whisper in my ear
"Where yo' man?" I said I'm single and I'm in college
He said he likes smart girls and that he from the islands
Gave him my number told him "make sure that you dial it"
Watched me as I walked away, you know your girl stylin'
Playing playlists off Tidal
He text me soon after I have to admit I got excited
He asked if I was tired, I waited and sat in silence
I know the code, but I was feeling bold, so I went over
We talked about religion, I'm a witness of Jehova
We talked about sports and all sorts of things on the sofa
The sun was coming up, I took the bed, he took the sofa
I told him take it slow, baby
You'll get to know me
He said I'm worth the wait
He agreed and he would show me that
Slow, slowly

[Bridge: Rapsody]
Slowly
Hold you baby
Hold you baby
I'll wait however long to hold you baby, baby

[Interlude: Rapsody & D.R.A.M. sample]

Cause I really wanna show you somethin'
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good

[Verse 2: Rapsody & D.R.A.M. sample]
What up boy? Oh ok, oh, you into retros? I got those
I got the 8's and 11's and, I mean, I mean whatever impress you
I mean, I'm just sayin'
I just wanna impress you, I got tickets to the game
And a shirt with your favorite team
I mean more than the rest do
I bought this new fit cause I want this night to feel special
And I paid the most for Uber, the black truck
Look hun, I just wanted to impress you
We can kick it, chill, it ain't gotta get sexual
I ain't the type to give it up fast
If you respect that then I'm sure it will impress you
To know I like you and I just wanna impress you darling
I know all the words to Prince too
I take my feelings back if you say that don't impress you
I like it that you hold conversations, that's intellectual
And you don't take yourself too serious, that's impressive too
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
It's important we communicate
Wait, I wanna impress you, I got the grapes
Wait, I wanna impress you, I got the 8's
You ain't just a regular friend to me as of late
And before I been feeling this way since MySpace
And I ain't like none of them other girls you used to date
You laughing but I wasn't impressed with your bad taste
I'm being honest, look I saved you ok?
Look I was hoping maybe you would try with me when
Bruh bruh split
Or maybe you ain't like I was a tomboy then, hmm
Or maybe you ain't think I was as pretty as them
Now you like maybe I shoulda came and said something back then, true
And I just wanna impress you darling
So what you like, the movies or walks?
A lit restaurant or home cooking at all?
A comedy show joyride or somethin' else special?
Look baby boy, I'm just tryna impress you
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make you feel good
So is you with me
And I just wanna impress you darling
And I just wanna make feel good
So is you with me
