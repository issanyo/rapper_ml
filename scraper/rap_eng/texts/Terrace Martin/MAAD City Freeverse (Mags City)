[Intro]
This town I run my nigga
315, that's my home my nigga
FBC is what I rep my nigga
Mags, bitch

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a flight, this here first class
First you subtract all the phonies, add your money, simple math
Never been a one to brag, I'm just speaking from my past
First I fuck her then I dash, guess I'm learning from my dad
This right here is tragic, flowing like a savage
Hey, they ain't talking cramps when they I say I be spazzing
Plus that kush got a nigga eyes low
[?] bumping and drive slow
Satan is my time hoe, what the fuck you think I grind for
Since a youngin' I was always told get them bucks
Said her life ain't been the same since (bleep) and me have fucked
But it's looking like I made it, the key to this is patience
If ya'll started from the bottom, I guess I started from the basement
Homie, why you always hating, mean-muggin with all them faces
Half my homies [?], other half caught some cases
But my brody doing well, so you know they making bail
If they saying I ain't hot, guess it's because I'm raising hell
Like, the old man or should I say amen
Since Jesus left this earth, I ain't fear a man
Faded behind up in the club, bitches doing the rain dance
So that's racks and racks, and that's a fact
Scream out "who that?", they yelling that's Young Mags
And that's a damn shame these chicks don't know my damn name
FBC OE, you niggas all know my campaign
I'm riding around on my side of town, that's the [?] bitch, so you heard this
These lames get on my nerves but I make all these lames nervous
So back up before my niggas start to act up, you get clapped up
Then wrapped up, then packed up, then shipped off
Watch me as I lift off like Space Balls or Space Jams
All these bars up in the booth, feeling like I'm caged in
Trunk sounds like a caveman, bass that he's just banging
Got this critics on their toes like I'm screaming hang ten
(Lean) Well surfs up, I'm bout' to join that surf club
Bad bitches catering, it's only right they serve us
My niggas ain't no joke, it's something you outta know
If you fuck around with them fuck arounds you get hold up, nigga
Tell Bravo to roll up nigga
Trying to smoke that sticky
315 be my home but also know as Mags City, muhfucka
