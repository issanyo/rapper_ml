Yea Compton, yea I mean that shit
Goes to be Dr Dre not DJ Quick
No disrespect to him but that's the realest shit that I could spit
Even he feel that shit
Because everybody goal is to be on top
If it ain't, the next question is why not
'Cause I could be getting work out, it don't squacks
'Cause the sentimental first week, if not I flopped in my mind
'Cause when the mils come I will switch
Yea, real niggas say real shit
Yea, ain't got shit to hide from
I'm Compton, they already said I'll die young
You get thirsty a thirsty to drink
I'm a little closer to 30 than you think
That's why I'm on point like a cold head
Feel good when P Lo call me old head
Yea so this is The Separation
I'm the motherfuckin man in the speculation
What? Ya'll came to lose, I came to win
They say it's kindred? Shit I gotta go in here
Shit, using the words as my weaponry
Law of reverse, don't know who comin at me
So can I ride with that shit?
Deuce to the 4, this that Comptown shit, he know
Diamond Lane over everything
And I'm yo bitch dream like the wedding ring
Yea, I keep her wedded, forever rain
And it was the same before the cheddar came
Mark, here's Martin, we back at it
Yea, with baby mamas, they're back at it
Feel like I'm seeing the same lines
Still I don't know what it feel like to have em all cool at the same time
Shit was fucked up
When I look at my kids I'm like I lucked up
I wouldn't trade em for nothing
To keep em safe I'd spend eternity with Satan
Uh, that was harsh huh?
My bite much bigger than my bark bruh
I'm feeling I ain't winning
See if I can push a few milie back


[Outro]
Problem
Diamond Lane
What?
So I did something
Word
Wuddup my nigga?
Aye man
So what you think man you 500 or what?
Alright bruh but that white cheese game you run in here we got it
So about making memories
You gonna make the connection bro
Man we got connected my friends in the high school with me
Diamond Lane is bigger than any music group you ever seen
This situation is bigger man
I just want the people to know it
Man I don't something man, talk to me
Shit man
Nigga today it's all about the music
Aye nigga
Straight up
Man I fuck with this tape
This shit go
(Diamond Lane)
