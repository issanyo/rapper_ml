[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Hold up, hold up, serve me while I roll up
Made a million dollars so my money hard to fold up
Came to get it popping now my homies trying to pour up
Ain't for wasting time so baby girl it's time to grow up
Grow up, grow up, drinking till we throw up
Throw a couple dollars then I throw a couple more up
Get a hundred thousand as soon as my niggas show up
Started from the bottom you just tell me when to go up
Standing still but all my diamonds dancing, dancing
Flirting hard what I'm gonna do with all them chances, answers
I'm gonna put my hands on your hips and waist and turn ya around
Give your lips a taste, you say you loving them skinny niggas
I'mma give you a demonstration, smoking loud like the rasta nation
Tatted up like a crazy person, say that you got work in the morning
Young Khalifa gonna make it worth it, 9-11 my Porsche be skirting
9-5 I'm putting that work in, breaking backs your eyes be lurking
In the morning thighs be hurting

[Verse 2: Courtney Noelle]
I just want to get right back to you
Tell me what you want me to do
I love when you pull me close to you
I can feel that you want me too

[Hook: Courtney Noelle]
Cause it don't take no rocket scientist to know
I wanna love you baby
And it don't take no psychologist to know
To know that I am crazy about you
You're the only one to me, you got me
You got me, yeah, you got me
You're the only one I need, you got me
You got me, yeah, you got me

[Verse 3: Courtney Noelle]
Everyday I get to spend with you
It's the only thing I want to do
Every time you make me feel so weak
When you tell me you're in love with me

[Hook]

[Break: Courtney Noelle]
All I wanna do is love you
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to brass for you?
Baby I belong to you
Anything you want from me
You got me

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Man fuck them little niggas, I'm the nigga!
Been the muscle car blower on killer
Niggas so hard, so loud, the whole neighborhood hear it
So good told your friend now she wanna come with ya
Call Young Khalifa the boss
You came in your panties was on night, you taking them off
Them hoes cannot come to my section, they run to my section
Show me the time of my life and maybe you can come to my section
Come get it off, say you need it all
Ain't have you a nigga come fuck you so good and so long
Call Young Khalifa the boss
Your panties were on when you came now they off, whoa!

[Hook]
