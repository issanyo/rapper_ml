[Intro: Tiffany Foxx]
Yeah, uh
So seductive
Uh, come on

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
I'ma shake this shit so I can come up quick
I might bounce it too hard, I might break this shit
I'ma go and act a fool, put my hand on my hip
Then drop it like it's hot and lick my lips
You can tell I'm from the Lou' from them watching my back
Let me show you how I do before your girl get back
Wanna see my face by my knees? Picture that
Might as well pay a fee 'cause the ass is fat
T. Foxx in your radar, chillin' at the bizzar
Jolliette in my hand, my hand in the cizzar
Feeling like a stizzar, wait, I am a stizzar
Dog house aroung my nigga, love around the yizzard
The way I pop them thangs like I'm fit to bust scene
Go head and riot niggas 'cause I'm fit to make a scene
Drop down and get my eagle on, got you in my zone
Asking ya niggas, do she have some panties on?

[Hook: Young Walt]
Why don't ya pop it on the floor?
Girl, shake that shit
Turn around dip it low
Girl, shake that shit
Let ya knees touch ya chest
While you shake that shit
Shake that shit, shake that shit

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now all the ladies in the place with the style and grace
Small waist, big booties with the pretty face
I love it how you wizzork, tight mini-skizzirt
Do it 'til it hizzurt, invited to the chizzurch
Tell all your friends that the dog's in the Louie
I bet a hundred dollars that they all wanna do me
Foxx is a cutie, better yet a beauty
Rolling with the house, yours truly
Can I get a shot of the plizzo, before the bar clizzos
Take you to the plizzad, lay you on the flizzoor
Two for the money and one for the shizzow
Keep it on the low, here we go, here we gizzo

[Hook: Young Walt]
Why don't ya pop it on the floor?
Girl, shake that shit
Turn around dip it low
Girl, shake that shit
Let ya knees touch ya chest
While you shake that shit
Shake that shit, shake that shit

[Bridge: Tiffany Foxx]
You can't deny this, I am the flyest
I know you wanna fuck with me
When I come through it's all about me
And you mad 'cause it's all about me

[Verse 3: Tiffany Foxx]
From the time I hit the club, I create a fan base
'Cause I'm known for acting up, being in your man's face
Four carrots on the pinkie, Cavali on the waist
Plus he heard I'm kinda kinky, so now he wanna taste
So now he wanna play in the Foxx big leagues?
I'ma throw it in his face, you know I'm a big tease
Planning trips oversea's, now he handing over these
Gave him a tipdrill, now he handing over keys
Please, I'll show you how to do this, hun
All in your mind and it's only half past one
'Cause the moments ours, been here for hours
Did you shake it like a motherfucker? Girl I know I was

[Hook: Young Walt]
Why don't ya pop it on the floor?
Girl, shake that shit
Turn around dip it low
Girl, shake that shit
Let ya knees touch ya chest
While you shake that shit
Shake that shit, shake that shit
