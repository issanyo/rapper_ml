[Terrace Martin]
I saw you standing over there
I wanna get to know you
Let me take you by your hand
And let's go somewhere

[Hook: Terrace Martin]
When you start to warm its close enough
I’ll take my time won't be in a rush
And you will see I'm the man for you
So let's stop playing and do what you do
One night or it can be forever
One night or it can be forever

[Phonte]
So outlandish, so bon voyage to Atlantis
So 1982 bumpin' Outstandin'
When she come to Raleigh she call me Uncle Charlie
Take it from the rear I'm her Gap Bandin'
Missed the plane on purpose, trying to act stranded
And talk about how she miss Tay
It is way out of the league, but gotta leave cause she used all her sick days
I know you're probably used to dudes that lie a lot
And take you to the mall, trick some doe, they buy a lot
Sayin' they take to the higher spot
But steady be getting their browse on like Chrome or Firefox
Looking for the next spring chicken is a hell of the life
But it really ain't living
You a hell of a sight but I really ain't trippin', cause it's the hell of the night
If y'all feelin', sang with 'em
Let's go!

[Hook]
When we stop to parties closer now
I'll take my time of being around
And you will see I'm the man for you
So let's stop playing and do what you do
One night or it can be forever
One night or it can be forever

[Terrace Martin: talking]
I’ve been really feeling your energy for the past few minutes we have been in this room toghether
I've tried to talk too, I've tried to sing it too
I think it’s about time I play it to you

[Terrace Martin: Saxophone]

[Bird and The Midnight Falcons]
Close enough
Be in a rush
I'm the man for you
Do what it do
Oh baby let's get down tonight
Ohhh
Baby don't hold out cause I'm in need of love
Really really really love you baby
Really really really love you baby
Oh baby let's make love tonight
Really really really love you baby
Really really really love you baby
Really really really love you baby
Oh my goodness
