[Verse 1]
You the one that’s responsible, remarkable
Honourable, always in control
You’re daddy’s pride with your momma’s eyes
Love ‘em both sorta like I love my life
They created you so the praise is due
Up high cause he favoured you by makin’ you
My compliments inside you is where heaven is
Beautiful and suited too, brighten up the dark
So I’mma nickname you star
Can I call you Mars? Or maybe Venus?
Nothing’s between us on this earth
But it’s God first
So every time you right by my side, God work

[Hook]
And you’re my little star
I see the way you shine
Don’t go too far now baby
I need you

[Verse 2]
Long walks thinking and planning our future (I need you)
Rushing tryna get home thinkin’ what I’m gonna do to ya (I need you)
Knew that it was you to trust, you can turn the Luther up
I must admit it girl you go the smoothest touch, got me stuck
And that’s alright though, I’mma let go, love’s in control
So let me ask, is you cool with that?
It’s you in fact cause you got us on a plateau
I can’t go back to the playa way of thinking
A queen like Billie Holiday, my inner being
Taking giant steps like John Coltrane [?]
Jump in the boom and me replacing your name with mine
This ain’t a game cause everything that I’m sayin’ sincere
You’re here with me not entertainin’ them lames
(Ooh, star, I love the way you shine)
See you appreciate the little things, actually
When the revenue was short, you’d be holdin’ up the fort
Beauty and compassion need balance any man would need
Though the future’s lovely, look at what my eyes see
Me giving you a seat to mark the beginning of we
Follow I take the lead, a little Jo and Jodeci
Spinning while I kiss your cheek, know my heart is yours to keep
(I’d do anything for you)
Yea you got it, boo
Lovin’ every side of you I receive the bright of you
(Oh yea), and I be there for you
Hard work and soft on you sweet like a summer foo
Stacked in the pants, yea, somethin’ like an Amazon
Gotta hand it to ya girl, ya everything a man want
And I’m thankful

[Hook]
