Fresh kicks on
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah on
Ah, ah, on
Fresh kicks on

[Verse One] [Terrace Martin]:
Kick game stupid homie, stepped off the kizzurb
Two flock of homes so I'm gone like the bizzurb
Smelling like izzurp, Snoop Dogg heard
Got me on super coture with the nizzerds
Air Force candy with the custom painted low
Adidas looking clean like a Grammy on the flo'
In and out the Beamer, fresh up out the cleaners
You got a mad shoe game, but mines much meaner
Terrace Martin is a pro
Every time I step up out the house is like a show
Every time I rock, I rock the Nikes right
And even when I'm posted, the kicks out of sight
Don't call the po-po, hi-tops cocoa
Got your boy grinning, dipped in linen like Yoko
Fresh out the box, orange tops with the socks
Sewed in for the jocks but I'm cool and you're not

[Hook]:
Fresh kicks on
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah on
Ah, ah, on
Fresh kicks on

[Verse Two] [Murs]:
It's Murs and I'm all about my Nike SBs
If your shoe game is weak then don't test me please
Brown, orange blazers but I don't wear them often
All the Blood homies going crazy at the Slauson
My Crip partnas they like my T-19s
It's a Los Angeles Dodgers thing, know what I mean?
Headed up to Earls, Crenshaw and Exposition
But watch your step, these is limited edition
What we can't look good? Fresh kicks in the hood
Tell you where I got 'em, yeah, you wish I would
Hunted like a bounty way out in Orange County
The white homies keep me ultra fresh like Downey
Don't try to clown me I got 50 pair
A shoe rack longer than Nipsey's hair
The homeboys jock and the chicks just stare
And if they got them at the mall, then I don't care

[Hook]:
Fresh kicks on
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah on
Ah, ah, on
Fresh kicks on

[Verse Three] [Murs]:
I got on my De La's, listening to Fela
Jordan 13's, from back in the day y'all
Blue, white and gray with the shoelaces braided
I got Red Hot Chilli Pepper kicks, stop playing
I got shoes you never seen before
So I know my kicks are more clean than yours
F-R-E-S-H
Break out your toothbrush and get your shoe game straight

[Hook]:
Fresh kicks on
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah on
Ah, ah, on
Fresh kicks on
