[Hook: Lloyd]
When I see you in the sheets I hear you calling my name
From side to side, to ignite your flame
And I know if I can get closer
You would let me in your life

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, talkin' and textin' on the telephone
And I can't wait to get home, sip the wine and grab the pint of Patron
I'm thinking about what we do, when it's just me and you
I'm kissing and I'm licking, plus I'm hugging and I'm rubbing and I'm sticking every spot that you want me to

[Bridge: Terrace Martin]
Holding you tight
For the rest of the night
And when you wake
Breakfast on your plate
For you, me and, you, me and, for you. Yep, I wanna be your servant
As long as I'm with I ain't really trippin', rubbin' on them thighs and proceed to lick the kitty-kitty

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
Now we just got done eating
And a little bit of freakin'
Kissing and huggin' too
Gotta get dressed and go to work boo
It's just like yesterday
I'm missing you like crazy and I see your face
Meet me at the studio at two o'clock
And I will clear the room and give it to ya non-stop
(To you)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
When I see you in the sheets I hear you calling my name
Oh, oh yes I do
And I know if I can get closer
You would let me in your life

[Saxophone Solo: Terrace Martin / Ad-libs: Lloyd]
Oh baby, oh baby
Calling my name
I hear you calling my name

[Hook]

[Ad-libs: Lloyd]
Calling my name
Closer, oh yeah
To let me in your life
To let me in your life
