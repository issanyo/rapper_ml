[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Verse 1]
You keep me up at night
To my messages, you do not reply
You know I still like you the most
The best of the best and the worst of the worst
Well, you can never know
The places that I go
I still like you the most
You'll always be my favourite ghost

[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think it's getting better
And then it gets much worse
Is it just part of the process?
Jesus Christ, it hurts
Though I know I should know better
Well, I can make this work
Is it just part of the process?
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts
(Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, it hurts)

[Chorus]
You need a big god
Big enough to hold your love
You need a big god
Big enough to fill you up

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Interlude]

[Outro]
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Pull down the mountain, drag your cities to the sea
Shower your affection, let it rain on me
Don't leave me on this white cliff
Let it slide down to the, slide down to the sea
Slide down to the, slide down to the sea
