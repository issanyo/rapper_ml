[Verse 1]
Passport, buspass
Plane ticket, first class
Long walks, far runs
Bike rides, make love
(Make love) make love
(Make love) make love
(make love)
Sun set, moon light
Fresh air, feels nice
Two of us, one mind
Leave the Mac at home, and the phone too
Let me hold you, and show you
And give you all my...
Attention babe (attention babe)
Attention babe (attention babe)
Attention babe (attention babe)
Call your friends tomorrow, shut the world out
You my girl now, my girl wild
Full body rubs, from head to toe
Till ya love below.. skin glow

[Hook]
Lets get away, get away, get away
Lets get away, way, way
Lets get away, way, way
Lets get away, way, ohhh

[Verse 2]
Champagne, home cooked meals, you the real deal
Feelings, are real for you
Hand in hand, all eyes on us
Overlook the sea, im looking at you
You looking back at me
What you worth to me, is priceless
See I might just, I might just, wanna wife you
I like you, I love you, I love you.. I love you

[Hook]
Lets get away, way, way
Lets get away, way, way
Lets get away, way, ohhh

[Outro]
Lets get away, get away, get away, get away
Leave the hate away, let's get away
Bring the love back, lets get away
Lets get away, get away, Leave the hate away
Lets get away, get away, I love you babe
Lets get away, lets get away

[Hook]
