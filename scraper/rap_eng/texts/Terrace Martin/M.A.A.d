[Verse 1 - FLO]
Gotta sit and think I convince my brain I'm living great
Dipping in this paint it's a false reality that I just create
At the city gate if you sense it's fate that's a risk you take
And I slip and it's a raise when I sip this drank lip stain how'd I get this way
I lost my mind my sanity in exchange for an awesome time
And I bought the lie should'a known this life would come at the cost of mine
When I cross the line often I'm apologize for the way that I talk to my
Family but I damage me and I suffer the loss of mind
When I start demise falling down way down in the ground where the coffin lies
And my target lock bullet hole to the head suicide in the parking lot
At an elementary school where the children at man I outta stop
Need to chill where the filter at for the thought I drop better call the cops
Off into another lonely night
Every time I close my eyes I can see a polt of guys
Good and evil no room for the two to coincide
Hot or cold I've been both no use to go inside
Blood boiling out the pot melting through the snow and ice
Loud voices make 'em stop need a U.F.O. to fly
And I'm seduced by your women clothed in white
All she wanna do is dance say she feeling so alive got me
Spinning round Russian Roulette roll the dice
My my my my chips down truth is over priced
I ain't feeling no remorse I ain't taking no advise
Captivated the sensation got me begging for a slice
Forbidden fruit upon my plate I been aching for a bite
They can't keep me here forever I'm just staying for the night
It's not a habit I'm no addict why you hating you just jealous
I ain't screaming you been yelling I ain't crazy who you telling
Dreaming of breaking through this cell and
Maybe split a few civilians vertebrae into a million
Tiny pieces I don't even need a reason to excel
At being evil I'm the villain **** the world is my rebellion
So sick of the B.S. and I'm just up
Victory left in the dump truck p.s. that was some luck
I'm in the Prius yelling one love with a gun tucked in my waistband
Run up and I blah blah wussup wit yo face man
Waist land I'm livin in I can't stand I'm giving in
To this hate and the reminiscence of a great man
The primitive and this A sand is imminent
I create madness and I been sitting here for days in a straight jacket
