[Verse 1]
Here I am again
In the same old space
I should really be by myself but
I just can’t bear the pain, no

[Chorus]
Give me your body
Give me your body
Don’t hurt nobody
Don’t hurt nobody
I want every single dose of ya, baby
Love me ‘til I’m numb
Love me ‘til I’m numb
It’s never enough
It’s never enough
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
And I don’t wanna come down from me
Baby, do that thing again
Please don’t stop
Need it all right now like I never had it
Your love is a drug
I’m your new addict
New addict

[Chorus]
Give me your body
Give me your body
I won’t tell nobody
Won’t tell nobody
I want every single dose of ya, baby
Love me ‘til I’m numb
Love me ‘til I’m numb
It’s never enough
It’s never enough
Oh, it’s never enough
It’s never enough
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Outro]
Here I am again, oh
Here I am again, oh
It’s never enough
You should
It’s never enough
