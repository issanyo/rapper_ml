[Intro: Kent Jamz & *Joon*]
Yeah
House party
House party
*We gon' turn this bitch up like Dr. Dre*

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
It's feelin' like the summer time and this is my song
Ain't nothin' wrong with a house party, a house party

[Verse 1: Kent Jamz]
Sup my homies in the party
Nah we ain't sippin your Bacardi
Half a burner in the trunk if you starchy
Bitches playing games like Aatari
Boogie in the [?]
Rollin' up me and my niggas
We just tryna meet some new bitches
Pull up to the club til' midnight
Real niggas don't
Pull up to the club til' midnight
Real niggas don't
Ain't nothin wrong with a house party
Ain't nothin wrong with a house party

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
It's feelin' like the summer time and this is my song
Ain't nothin' wrong with a house party, a house party

[Verse 2: P]
Poor girly, its time to party
Thank god its Friday I can go outplay
We ain't tryna start shit, nah hardly
I prolly pull to the spot hella tardy
Puffin on strong
You know we got the bomb babe
No matter what a hatin' nigga gon' have something to say
Niggas girlfriends trippin' off of molly
She single for the night
Acting hella naughty
Me, her and her best friend [?]
She let me hit it fast like a ferrari
And now she love me like thats what they all say
Well I can't take you home girl, I'm sorry
Now I'm hella paranoid, hella paranoid
Hoes keep calling my phone
Think its time I go home
But next weekend its on

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
It's feelin' like the summer time and this is my song
Ain't nothin' wrong with a house party, a house party

[Verse 3: Joon]
A nigga slumped landing on a lil hotty
And she just called me "boo" thats my gotti
Man imma take her pretty ass shopping
But she can't get nothin' but a keychain and some [?]
Who left the food table all sloppy?
Man you gettin' blunt, got turned into hot wings
Man niggas ain't shit
And bitches prolly worst
Thats why they turnt
But we gon make it work
This shits poppin'
Now homies got the [?]
I ain't have to say it if you got it
Man I hate it when the phonies always spot me
Hit me with the "the musics trippin"
[?]
Let it go, let it go
Man its always a tick
Let it go, let it go

*Gunshots*

[Hook: Kent Jamz]
It's feelin' like the summer time and this is my song
Ain't nothin' wrong with a house party, a house party

[Outro: Kent Jamz]
It feels like I'm back home
When I look in your eyes
Ain't nothing wrong
Meet me in your daddy room
You know what I wanna do
