[Intro]
(Uh)Give These Niggas a glass of water
Or maybe they need some Cola
Or a bad bitch named Zola
Skin Mocha
She Flaming like Nova
And yeah she do yoga
She not snake like Cobra
Pussy bring coma
Yeah that shit Coca

Ahhhhhhhhhh, Shit!

[Hook]
These niggas on it so thirsty, thirsty
The hoes they be boppin' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty

[Verse 1]
She summer time fineeeeeeeee.(Ha!,Yeah!)

And OV Yen just stepped up in this bitch
Yes I'm bout to kill this shit
This beat I'm fucking feeling it

Sorry Kendrick and Cyhi
As I perform Drive-by, upon this cadence
I'm drum-line on that beat and pussy
Yes I'm fucking flagrant
My niggas smoke a nick bag of funk
Before them cannons blatant
Say hello to satan
Brookdale got a new patient
Yah momma impatient
Cause yah body bout to be

Vacant of a soul. Your shit cold
My shit cold, nigga my shit cold
Yes I am without control
As I pull bank roll out my bi-fold
And perform light shows with the mic though
I might be walking like Michael

I'm basically a disciple
My iPhone note is my bible
It rappers suicidal
Who entitled you best rapper in the book?

Nigga look. got you shook
You should've stayed in them books
Or worked McDonalds this summer
Let me pull up in black hummers
And let yo bitch be my plumber

We knocking like Gin Rummy
She off the Gin and the Rummy
I think she just popped a molly
That sweat running down her body
Woulda thought that bitch spoke Somali
Soon be smoking on that holly
Out in Bali
With a bank account that'll Ali
Any of you basic niggas

Face it niggas, I'm the shit
And Imma need some moist toilets
Before I get back to it
Shittin!

(Yeah, Ok)

[Verse 2]
Ok I'm back to it
Munching on this Carro-it
Looking like bunny wabbit

Its duck season
So I'm feasting
Hold my head high like a beacon
For these achievements
I'm in the garden of Eden
Better go get the better Deacon
I'm dancing with demons
And tricking with witches
On the road to riches
I'm evil, I'm vicious
I'm burning down niggas bridges

Relentless
Bed-Stuy nigga on a killing spree
Yes I do this shit with ease
Nigga please

When you walk by don't say shit to me

Only real nigga alive dat strives to be a winner
Fish filet ass niggas
Y'all bitches is on the menu
It's sad when niggas compare me to Kendrick
I'm a beginner
Dez niggas been in da game for a minute
Should I continue
My bars could carry a lot of monkey niggas to they pinnacle
My lyrical is cynical
Betta watch as I fucking spit at you
You against the wall like Mystikal
Run you like an elliptical
Make you need fucking clinical
It's pitiful

You can call me cunning
But you can't call my bluffing
I ain't bluffing
I'm just shunning sack rappers who ain't quite stunning
It's been a very long time coming
So tell my niggas roll me up something every time I come through, through, through

[Outro]
These mixy niggas on it so thirsty, thirsty
The hoes they be bopping' so thirsty, thirsty
Haters they be watching so thirsty
