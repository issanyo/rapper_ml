[Intro: Terrace Martin]
Welcome to here my dear
Oh who am I? I'm Terrace Martin
No not Terrence not terrence, Terrace Martin
But that's Overdoz over there by the way
Oh him with the P-hat? That's Wiz Khalifa

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yahh
You know I'm high till I die when I roll through
Walk right past ya nigga I don't know you
Brought a couple g's and my niggas all g's
I'm just really trynna see what a couple of these hoes do
Got a bottle in my hand and a blunt too
Little model act bad but she want to
Heard i got ends yeah that money I spend
Tell her if she got friends and she rolling they can come too
Yah, but don't say shit
Love how ya ass move like a earth quake hit
Kush in my lungs I'm higher than a space ship
Different color diamonds on my chain on some space shit
You should be drankin so fill your cup
Don't know about you but me I'm getting fucked up
And if things go how I need them to go
I'mma have me a bad lil bitch in my truck, yah

[Hook 2x: Overdoz & Terrace Martin]
Since I don't know what else to say
I guess I'll just roll up another one

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Gotta Pittsburgh fitted and my chucks on
Lookin for a bad bitch, so I can get sucked on
Need me a champion, shawty gotta win
Drinking all night don't matter what I gotta spend
Homie I get high, so a nigga just senseless
And I'm real fly, so my hoes are expensive
I'm a young guy, getting dumb riches
So I don't got time for the hood rat bitches
Yeah, see how I ball no fade away
These yellow diamonds and my charms while the haters hate
Them hoes fight for ya boy like Flava Flav
Take you home, bend you over like a paper plane
You look good in ya outfit
I'm tryna see how that thang look when you out of it
I'm gon' live how I live
Take a bad lil' bitch to the crib

[Hook 2x: Overdoz & Terrace Martin]
Since I don't know what else to say
I guess I'll just roll up another one

[Verse 3: Overdoz]
You know I'm high till I die when I roll through
Don't wear fitteds homeboy cause my throat too big like Goku
But I keep a bitch on my team
With her ass so big that her jeans wear is like a [?]
And she with the function, so you could probably poke too
Baby leave your weed at home cause we don't smoke boof
Bless me with some throat while I roll to
And I'mma stroke that thang like a real loc supposed to

[Hook 2x: Overdoz & Terrace Martin]
Since I don't know what else to say
I guess I'll just roll up another one
