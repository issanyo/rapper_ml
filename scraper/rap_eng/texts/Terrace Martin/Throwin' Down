Anchored, big Snoop Dogg, oh boy
Pass me my moonshine, nephew
Haha, yeah, you are about to witness something
You never thought you would witness before
Rock out with your motherfuckin' cock out

Rollin into town to see all my friends
Hit a bottle of jack and a few dead ends
You better leave your girl back at home
Cause if your rollin with us your gonna leave alone

I've said it at least a hundred times
We got Texas soul and the Dogg that rhymes

Hey, just pass the moonshine
Hey, everything is just fine
Hey, hangin' out in the sun
Throwing down and just havin' fun

Throwin bottles and cans till the party ends
Sleep away the day so we can do it again
The phones blowin up were out the door
Gotta pick up the boys from the liquor store

I've said it at least a hundred times
We got Texas soul and the Dogg that rhymes

Hey, just pass the moonshine
Hey, everything is just fine
Hey, hangin' out in the sun
Throwing down and just havin' fun

With the high of Rick James and the fly of Sly Stone
I'm laid back in the sunshine
It's Anchored, Snoop Dogg, one time
For the selecta, chiggy checka
Shoot my own scenes the directa, connecta
Fired up, in the winter time
I'm going down until I hit the finish line
I never quit, yeah this is anotha hit
Aww bitch nigga, I created this
I made a grip and took a chip
And rollercoaster took a trip
And take a picture, look at this, look at this
Eh eh, if you can see what I see
I mix a bag of that coffee with a sack of that weed
I enter through your mind and put you at ease
And you can tell cause it smell like a gang of Christmas trees
Compelling to read, see I'm a felon indeed
I like my weed with no seeds, breakdown
It's the throw down, go down, you know how we roll
Anchored and the dogg pound

Hey, just pass the moonshine
Hey, everything is just fine
Hey, hangin' out in the sun
Throwing down and just havin' fun

Throwing down and just havin' fun
Throwing down and just havin' fun
Throwing down and just havin' fun
Hey
