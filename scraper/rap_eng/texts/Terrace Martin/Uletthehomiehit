Probably never fall in love again (Probably never fall in love again)

You let the homie hit
Always got to start some drama, You let the homie hit
I bet you never told ya mama, you let the homie hit

I’ll probably never fall in love again (Probably never fall in love again)
Probably never fall in love again (Probably never fall in love again)
But I’m the bad guy
But I’m the bad guy
Probably never fall in love again (In love again)

Hot damn hoe here we go again (Hot damn hoe here we go again)
Every chick I meet the homie done went up in (every chick I meet, every chick I meet)
Can you please let me know what you thought we could be
(Can you please let me know what you thought we could be)
After you lift your legs to the world you bring, you problems to me
Expecting my arms to be
As wide as your knees
But I'm straight, put that pussy back in your jeans
I don't wanna be involved in no way, shape or form
Not even a chain letter should pop up on my screen
[?] with the bathroom seat down
The homie told me that your head game weak now
The homie told me that your head game weak now

[Kent Jamz]:
You let the homie hit
Always got to start some drama, You let the homie hit
I bet you never told ya mama, you let the homie hit

I’ll probably never fall in love again (Probably never fall in love again)
Probably never fall in love again (Probably never fall in love again)
But I’m the bad guy
But I’m the bad guy
But I, But I
Probably never fall in love again (In love again)

Man these hoes is a trip
Fine as hell but you ain't worth shit
Having kids like it's hittin' a lick, you ain't trynna do nothing but get famous off pics
A couple bands will make a boujie broad strip
Come in baby let me rub on your tits
Your best friends is haitn' why they alwasy gosspin'
They let my bros hit, why they even talking shit
My momma told me let the hoes go (damn)
I wish I can but good don't drive me loco
Now what you wanna do baby?
I beat the pussy up, hope you don't sue baby
You got some hot friends? Bring em through baby
Fuck them other niggas, you know were the truth baby
And if you fall in love, I'll drive you too crazy
When I'm done, I ain't wifing shit
