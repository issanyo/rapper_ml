[Verse 1: Mozzy]
Yeah, who I'm 'pose to turn to for guidance
I feel like I lack a lil' knowledge
I know I never make it to a campus of a college
We the ones used to pick on the scholars
I been too concerned with gettin' dollars
I been too concerned with all this Gucci, all these Robin's
I been too concerned with tryna move all of this product
Product of my environment or how I was brought up
My patna still in the hospital, his body shot up
Look at who they brung in the office after Obama
I ain't even vote, I know I'm part of the problem
At the same time, I'm showin' you how to prosper
Came up from nada to shoppin' at Ross and Nautica
We came up from nada to shoppin' at Ross and Nautica
Mama say she proud of us, proud of you too mama
'Cause now I know what you been through mama

[Bridge: Mozzy]
Pain never heals, I done ran out of pills
I be scared that it's real, what I say about this is
Hit my dougie in the field, made it here without a deal
Tryna run a nigga pennies when I'm worthy of them Ms
I just roll with my people to Beverly Hills
Even them tricks thuggin' for years, baby it's real
Lot of wear and tear on me, from all the homies we buried
When you take field trips, you better know where to kill

[Interlude: Phora]
Yeah, I mean this shit crazy how far we came, right?
Just lookin' back on this shit like, man
No king should ever stop us
Yeah, uh, look

[Verse 2: Phora]
See you might take a loss, but you live and you learn
They say the ones that you love are the quickest to turn
And the more you play with fire, then the quicker you burn
I ain't concerned with that, hit the gas, dip and I swerve
My nigga aye, tryna turn this bucket to a Benz truck, aye
Me and Mozzy tryna get these Ms up aye
Took some Ls been tryna get my wins up
God lookin' down but I been gettin' my sins up
Word to mama, she pray for me on the daily
Know this lifestyle is wild and I drive you crazy but
I'm all in like I'm tryna own the casino
I just feel like my life is movie by Scorsese
Look at how far we came, this shit is crazy
Used to have to spread Top Ramen, how could you blame me?
All this money couldn't take away these scars
But I guess they are only there so we don't forget who we are, right?
