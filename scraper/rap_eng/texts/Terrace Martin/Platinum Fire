[Chrous: Arin Ray]
Just what I had in mind
The perfect kind
Ahead of our time
You and I
What I had in mind
Just what I had in mind
Just what I had in mind
Just what I had in mind
Just what I had in mind
Just what I had in mind

[Saxophone Solo: Terrace Martin]

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Just what I had in mind
The perfect kind
Ahead of our time
You and I
What I had in mind
Had in mind
Just what I had in mind
The perfect kind
Ahead of our time
You and I
Had time
