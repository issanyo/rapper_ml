[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
I’m looking at your pretty face
Smiling from across the room
Baby can I know your name
Thank you for the number we’ll talk soon
Your conversation’s right, girl
I usually don’t call on the first night
I can’t control where my heart goes
Eyes closed but I see your sweet spirit though
There’s no rush, I wanna take my time you the one

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You’re the one, you’re the one
Baby, you’re the one I want
You can have my love, have my love
Baby, you can’t have it all girl

You’re the one, you’re the one
You’re the one, you’re the one
You’re the one, you’re the one

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
A little time’s passed
And I really wanna make it last
So tell me what I gotta do
I wanna be the man for you
Baby you can relax
Naughty thoughts going through your head as you lay back
Just give me the hand and hold on tight to me girl
If you let me love you, baby we could share rooms
So what you think of that, all truth know gang like that
All you gotta do is say yes, all you gotta do is say yes

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
You’re the one, you’re the one

[Outro]
Buying season
I work hard, earn hard
I got what it takes to get whatever I want
And it's you
Nah for real, no spoof, no spiel
And if I know what I know
Then you want me too
You did not win me
So you can't lose me
Loving you is my choice
All other options are through
You see, I threw them out once, twice
Now they're gone
Not blinded by selfish love, I know what page we on
Man, this love was a sleeper
And some call me a keeper
You can call me what you want because
I know me love, and I'm a leader
And some follow my steps
And move like I do, but they bank accounts in love
Is bankrupt so they use lusty deals
And old spiked heels to keep you in their space
But freeloaders get expensive, and renters never stay
Well not for long, but me?
Well I can't help how I feel
I mean, even if I could, it wouldn't do no good
See, I've licked and closed the seal
Signed the finer paperwork, finished up in that scroll
I got you baby, long haul
You ready for me? Let's go
