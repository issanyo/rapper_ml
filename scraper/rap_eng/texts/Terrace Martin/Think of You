[Verse  1]
What i dreamed wasn’t real until i met you
What i felt the first time i ever date you
I used to stay up late Listen to Mary Jane
Remember girl this May

[Chorus]
Got you in my mood
Baby yeah come over soon
Sometimes i do Think of you
I do think of you

[Verse  2]
What i felt the first time i ever laid you
I used to stay up late listen to Mary Jane
Remember her this May

[Chorus]
Got you in my mood
Baby it ain’t over
It ain’t over
Sometimes i do think of you.
I do think of you
