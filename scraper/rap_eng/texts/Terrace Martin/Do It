[Chorus:]
How she really wanna do it?
F*ck her till her body stay fluid
She Aaliyah ‘94
I’m a leader, she a student ooh
I’mma have to tell her man to move it
Gave her game and she was really with the movement
How you really wanna do it?
Like that or this, or that?
How you really wanna do it?
The top, below, the back
How you really wanna do it

[Verse 1:]
Know who you’re f*cking with, Bentley like the Chinese government
I ain’t with [?] sleep, f*ck again
And pray she never hits me up again, not you baby
Yo shit crazy
Nails, eyes, bags on fleek
How they even gonna weaken me
Like the Westwood Eastwood
The ego make her come after the ‘D’
I admit I hit her bareback Winnie the Pooh shirt
Roommate introduced her then I done and deuced her
She told me she a friend, I’m thinking yeah right
I need a red light
She moved away, I needed attention
A hooper got his check and she needed admission
And I ain’t hate her
I tell her get a bottle [?] the fish
And bring it to the nigga who done touch her how she feels

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Now I don’t need your eye contact
Cause I can read the signs without navigation
You be getting high off contact
Ooh but get this, I can show you what you missing
And I can go without a sentence
When I said this would you come along?
Blowing up your phone, I can tell you been done wrong
With them dark shades on
Hey you remind me of Aaliyah back in ‘95
Yo patches be your leader, show your wild side
I hope you get Amnesia when you get side-eyed
Just this one time, don’t let this fly by
I know they make the rules like I’m Jewish
But I’mma let you drive this time I got insurance
Yeah I know we both under the influence
But as long as you cover me we’ll get through it

[Chorus]
