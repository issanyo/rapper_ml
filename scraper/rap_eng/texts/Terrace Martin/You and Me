[Verse 1]
Now I’m sure if we could understand the beatings
Like a marching band inside the yard
Of every voice and piece the melody, that speeding chord
Hold it all in, it’s really the heart
I know it’d just be simple baby, coulda started that way
If it started with love, what are you gonna do?
I’m right here where you are
And I’m playing my part
Harmonizing with yours
And it's perfect, oh

[Chorus]
That’s all we know, is you and me
That’s how they’ll know, it’s you and me
So, let’s show them growth, that’s how we grow
Just you and me, I’m giving the world
To you baby, oh driving you crazy
Oh

[Verse 2]
Now I’m sure if we  could speak in tapestry
And record the dream  of our consciousness
It would reveal the secrets of our life and mind
And live in perfect peace across the world
I know it’d all be simple baby, wouldn’t have to wait
There’d be no heart to break, what are you gonna do?
When all you can is trust, do you have the strength?
Are you gonna wait? Forever is too late

[Chorus]
That’s all we know, is you and me
That’s how they’ll know, it’s you and me
So, let’s show them growth, that’s how we grow
Just you and me, I’m giving the world
To you baby, oh driving you crazy
Oh

[Bridge]
We float around then we conquer the hour, then we
Come to an aisle then we contemplate the vow but see
We come around then we figure it out did we come
With all the power to lead come build your destiny

[Chorus]
That’s all we know, is you and me
That’s how they’ll know, it’s you and me
So, let’s show them growth, that’s how we grow
Just you and me, I’m giving the world
To you baby, oh driving you crazy
Oh
