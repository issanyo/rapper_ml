[Verse 1: YG]
First, you find a house and scope it out
Find a Chinese neighborhood
'Cause they don't believe in bank accounts
Second, you find a crew and a driver
Someone to ring the doorbell
And someone that ain't scared to do what it do
Third, you pull up at the spot
Park, watch, ring the doorbell and knock
Four, make sure nobody is home (knock knock)
They gone, okay it's on
Don't be scared, nigga, you in now
If the police come you gonna find out who your friends now
That ain't me talking, that's your mind playing tricks on you
You're conscious cause you know you got 9s with 2 clips on you
But fuck that, motherfuck that plasma
And fuck that laptop, go and get that jewelry box
You tryna get paid? Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson
They'll give you cash back in the same day

[Hook: YG]
Meet the motherfucking flockers
Make money-money, make money-money-money
(Make some noise if you've ever stole something in your life)
Take money-money, take money-money-money
Don't be ashamed, it's okay, baby
Make money-money, make money-money-money
Make some noise if you ever stole a dollar out your mama purse
When she wasn't lookin while y'all was in Church
Take money-money, take money-money-money

[Verse 2: Tee Cee]
Niggas don't know the history 'bout the flock
Put the flathead in the door, pull it, make it go flock
Hit the first drawer, grab a nigga some socks
That nigga in the car better be listening to that box
Ay, I ain't staking out shit, nigga
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe and ding-dong-ditch
Ain't a safe I can't crack, nigga, that's on Crip
I'm with my Pirus from Compton, we gon' pass and get rich, ayy!
50 racks, three niggas, Sixteen-five a split
Let some weeks go by we at the dealership
I never took notes, nigga I need the pink slip
Hit Icey, macking up for my bullshit
Spent about ten cash
We jumped into the whip and did the whole dash
D. Loc my nigga, my nigga
Hit my first lick, pass with my niggas, ayy!
