[Intro] [Murs talking]:
Y'all ready? (Nah. They ain't ready.) Drink up. It's Melrose
Aye, y'all white boys thought y'all had this all shit to yourself
But like, now the niggas is starting to come into the club and y'all be kinda nervous
Cause we dance on beat. And your girl dance on beat. So she wanna dance with us

[Verse One] [Murs]:
Hey white boys!
The niggas is back
It's not about gold chains, triggers and gats
Baggy jeans, white tees, fitted caps
Me? I'm from the days of Hilfiger backpacks
So
Let's slow it down
Grab your white girl cause it's going down
Got a white chick who love my ass
Suck my dick and she pay cash
I'm so crazy
That's T. Martin, it's Melrose baby!
Now let's talk about race relations
Your lips, your tits, my dick, your face and
Huh
That's so awesome
I'm from Pico he's from Slauson
So bossing
So clean
Now throw your hands up if you over 18

[Hook] [Terrace Martin]:
It's no surprise
Look at all the women in this light
So many wanna hop on this ride and they don't wanna get off, you know why?
Cause I'm hot to def, I'm on fire
Just too fly, just that type of guy
Hands up in the sky girl
Have a ball, we don't mind
Hey ladies (hey baby!)
What you wanna do (get crazy!)
Hmmmm
That's exactly what I thought
Just remember this thing girl when you start
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop
Go
Don't stop

[Verse Two] [Murs]:
Ahhhhh
So many white girls, so little time
Now I gotta try to fit 'em all in my rhyme
Blond hair, brunettes, red heads, black
Shoulder tattoo, shake it up from the back
Panties from pink, Hollister I think
I'll eat it all night if your shit don't stink
Oooooh
Brazilian
Topless, top of my building
No tan lines, so perfect
After sex then she goes surfing
Ha ha
I'm in a different world
I'm out the hood messing with different girls

[Terrace Martin]:
Like Puerto Rican, black on occasion, Caucasians
Skinny and big girls, Asian persuasion
Light and dark, it don't matter to me
Baby just have a job and suck with no teeth

[Hook] Terrace Martin]:
It's no surprise

Have a ball, we don't mind
Hey ladies (hey baby!)
What you wanna do (get crazy!)

[Bridge] [Terrace Martin]:
Black girls just go, go, go
White girls just go, go, go
Asian girls just go, go, go
Puerto Rican just go, go, go
If you a girl just go, go, go
If you a ho just go, go, go
Hoodrats just go, go, go
West coast just go, go, go
