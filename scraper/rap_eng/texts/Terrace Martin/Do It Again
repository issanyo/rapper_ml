[Intro - Wiz Khalifa]
Yo, this ya man Wiz Khalifa, yo La Leakers, where the fuck did y’all find this one?
I had that one zipped up with the good shit

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar]
Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey “press play” while I press up on a girl
In the midst of the smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She’ll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that’s power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin’, drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That’s real big, pop my collar, pop that lid

[Hook - Terrace Martin]
Flashin’ lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, heads is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
Smoke like this 'til the sun come up (the sun)
We’ll do this 'til the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard 'til the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favorite song
This girl that’s dancing on me ain't got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don’t tell
Anyone about us, I’m here to party all night

[Hook - Terrace Martin]

[Bridge - Wiz Khalifa]
Come to my section (my section)
And down some of this liquor
Then tell me what it hit for
Gon' be some things I don’t remember
So take some camera phone pictures

[Bridge - Kendrick Lamar]

[Hook - Terrace Martin]

[Outro - Kendrick Lamar]
(Los Angeles Leakers)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Where the fuck did y'all get this record from, homie?
