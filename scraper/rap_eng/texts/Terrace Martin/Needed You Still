[Verse 1]
I've been travelling the wild
Feel like the return
I'ma go a little bit numb
I feel so high
High
But I'm too far away
Somewhere you won't hurt

[Chorus]
Where are you when I need you still?
Will you be around?
Where are you when I need you still?
Will you be around?

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Where are you when I need you still?
Will you be around?
Where are you when I need you still?
Will you be around?

[Verse 2]
Like the drums beat
When I'm needing
Like an old grandmama needing a sweater
Sweat beading since you been away, internal bleeding
Memories racing through my mind
Pulled over by one time
'Cause they was speeding
But one time we were greedy
We were meeting, we were eating
Miss me or miss me not
Food for thought, we were feeding
Romeo and Juliet, deadly plot
We were praying to Jesus
Better give us one more shot at playing boat or bird or dock
So we can stand back in each others shoes
Walk a mile instead of three thousand
Jagged rocks and ragged socks
As long as the world is not too lonely to look at clocks
They remind me of how much time has passed
Since we last took a walk
Since I seen you last, the cat took my tongue
Left me nothing to talk
When I'm needing like the drums beating
Needing you to bring back the chalk
So we can outline the love
Flirting with ash to dust
Feel like a vast land between us
A nomad feigning for romance and a bus
I feel like the last man with no meaning
My heaven been in hell for months
I put faith in no man but in you, I trust
Hell, they could hold you ransom for seven billion bucks
I would pay with interest if it meant the angels would let you up
If it is what it isn't, fuck a visit
Do time in solitary time in solitary confined lock up
If it came with a conjugal touch
What is this?
I mean, I'm in need of you
I'm crippled, I need a crutch
Since you been gone Cupid done tripled in this punch
Butterflies too far gone to call home my guts
All I got is some lines of poem
And some etcetera such and such
I'm a word but hard to recite
I'm a bird but hard of flying
I'm a dead man but hard of dying
I'm addicted to holograms and reunited
Or maybe the man the bag lady is finally finding
Maybe Erykah Badu gon' make a remix called
Maybe boat to you too heavy to be riding
I'm six
I'm at an autograph signing
But nobody there to do the signing
I'm lonely like Ginuwine without his pony
I wonder if I'm the only
So much distance, feel like we phoney
Like we never really exist
Like when we FaceTime you be like "who is this?'
We stuck between a rock and a hard kiss
Running out of luck with the hard kicks
But when you were here, I was every king
When you went away, I wasn't a thing
I was a bad keyboard player
Out of tune with God on the Lord's day
Half the way not here, no more to say
I always wonder when he jumped out the window that day
If he thought 'dang, I shoulda stayed'
I need you but it was too late
I need you, how I feel when you in a different state
I need you, feel like I jumped that same way
I need back, back in the day when we was young
Before you went away
But I got hope we will rise again and repeat back to the one
Like when Glasper played
I'm done
