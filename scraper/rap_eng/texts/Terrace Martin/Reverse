[Verse 1]
Can you park right there?
I just wanna sit here for a minute
I don’t know when this moment will happen again
So let me live in it
Breathing your air cause when you’re not here it’s different
I wish i could turn back the hands of time

[Chorus]
I’m really not trying to make you miss this flight
But it feels out right can we just reverse?
Reverse! Can we go back to the time
when we wanna make it work
It hurts. I don’t wanna move forward
Say it’s not alright
I don’t wanna move forward
Say it’s not alright

[Chorus]
Reverse Reverse !!
Can we go back to the time
when we wanna make it work
It hurts. I don’t wanna move forward
Say it’s not alright
I don’t wanna move forward
Say it’s not alright
