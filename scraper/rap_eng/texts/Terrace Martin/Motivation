[Hook: Brevi]
You can be my motivation
Everything I need, I need
Don't be scared, baby
Baby, love can't hurt you
Love can't hurt you

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Can't hear what these niggas talking about sayin' they're dope
Cause I'm twice that ill
If this was the 80's we'd be diving fast, doing coke
Cause my life's that real
They say what's good, it ain't always good for you
And when you live fast, normal shit it should bore you
When you're a boss, you got niggas in the hood for you
And when you're rich, you got a chef to cook your food for you
On the road gettin' blow, on the plane for some days
They say when I smoke illegal, I made a killin' off of this shit
That mean that crime pays
Bitches see the sparkles in the club and start givin' it up
Niggas see how these hoes all trippin' about those
So they start gettin' it

[Hook: Brevi]
You can be my motivation
Everything I need, I need
Don't be scared, baby
Baby, love can't hurt you
Love can't hurt you

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoke weed like a Marl-ay
I'm boss and they do whatever I say
Treat everything like it's Friday
And we're rolling up weed like it's Friday
Y'all ain't really on the shit I'm on
30 bottles in the club and you smell that strong
Smoking weed on the highway
Saying "fuck what you think, I did it my way"

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
My life's still a dream to me, and I don't wanna wake up
Dreams come true, I see, I became what I'm supposed to be
Passport missions, world-class musician
I'm on another high
Baby, take my hand so we can touch the sky
Now hop in my spaceship so we can fly way out
To a planet called Love where there's no hatin' allowed
Where negative energy don't even exist
Just close your eyes and enjoy the bliss of real love

[Hook: Brevi]
You can be my motivation
Everything I need
Don't be scared, baby
Baby, love can't hurt you
Love can't hurt you

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoke weed like a Marl-ay
I'm boss and they do whatever I say
Treat everything like it's Friday
And we're rolling up weed like it's Friday
Y'all ain't really on the shit I'm on
30 bottles in the club and you smell that strong
Smoking weed on the highway
Saying "fuck what you think, I did it my way"
