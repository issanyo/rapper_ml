[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's lets talk talk bout bout love
Let's lets talk talk bout bout trust
Let's lets talk talk bout bout you
Let's lets talk talk bout bout us
Let's talk about our love
And when it's said and done
Gimme some of you you (4x)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Baby got a nigga feeling like kid again
Make the homie wanna go and have a kid and then
Marry on an island probably on a private boat
Total silence while we gliding on Hawaii's coast
Body of a goddess
Brains of a Harvard student
Her intellect can intercept the brightest star moving
Hear the horns playing?
They playing for that girl
I ain't playing I plan to go around the world
Might settle down
Like fuck bitches
Call the homies up
I'm in love nigga
Can you believe that?
She gonna follow where my lead at high off life quit then relapse
You heat them horns playing?
They playing for that women
She think a nigga on
I think im on to something

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh
And so I ask my
How it feel to be with somebody that you define
As the perfect human that shaped under his design
God almighty
Golly you probably over-shadow sunshine
Man I feel sorry
For them hoes thats playing catch up inside the city
Or catching feelings when they hearing that you fucking with me
Or I'm fucking with you, that vise versa
I'm feeling it, you killing it where them big hearses
You hear them horns playing?
They playing for that diva
Im paying for that Rozy, im paying for that refeefa
Cuz this a celebation
Im seranating every occasion now peep my cadance
I break it down love
You break it down love
Then bring it back up
Fuck in front of the mirror break it till we get bad luck
You hear tham horns playing?
They playing for that queen
I think im really on
Cuz she on my team

[Outro]
In the beginning it always good
Until..
