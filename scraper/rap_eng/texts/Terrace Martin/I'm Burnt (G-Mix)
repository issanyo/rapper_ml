G-Mix!

(Chorus)
I'm Burnt, errbody sayin' I'm Burnt
Nigga you should see when I'm turnt
Homie I'm Burnt, burnt, burnt the fuck out
Ya'll ready know what I'm bout
You know how I'm Burnt, cuz I got that FIRE
You know how I'm Burnt, cuz I got that FIRE
You know how I'm Burnt, cuz I got that FIRE
And the whole goddamn world keeps tellin' me that I'm Burnt!

Verse 1 (Snoop Dogg)
My music's so loud like the 15's in the coupe
Got a new routine, fresh fruit
Like to be sweated and pitted too
Turnt up, what it do?
Smokin' dope, count my revenue
Mectric, Electric Avenue
What it do one stop cause he got that (UGGH) that make a nigga heart stop

Verse 2 (Daz)
2 G's, DP
Mini Monster, you know about me
Caddilac on chrome, two toned
Sittin' home alone with a brand new phone
I'm original, life stays coated
West Coasters, sippin' Hen getting toasted
I like the way she hood and I like the way she think
But the only problem is if the bitch's pussy stinks

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Roscoe)
Yo it's R to the Bat, scars on the tats
I pull up at the front tell em' park it in the back
I'm Burnt, more than Half-Baked I'm crispy
Flavour of the month, no flavour on the blunt
Havin' money out the ass is a blast
And all we get to do is smoke weed and talk trash
Puffin' Hash till' it sends my moustache surrounded by...

Verse 4 (Problem)
My diamond lane chain swang hang and it's glitterin'
Fucked my ex bitch bare down and caught clymidia
Yeah that's burnt, burnt like a fire, I'm higher
Than the fucking voice of Mariah
Roll it like a tire, all fours on the long freeway
In the diamond lane can you see may
Problem, for those who don't know about 'im
I'm the nigga walking round with all the smoke comin' out 'im

(Chorus)

Verse 5
I'm down on blues, In the club on shrooms
Old School, take it back, Mac Milly chrome tubes
Chrome feet, lowkey, OG on gooms
Like the callin' games on him standing in the corner like tombs
Twerk, work, look at how she flirt
When me, Snoop, Daz , Problem go burnt, so burnt, so burnt
Have no fear, I told her come ere and put my dick in her ear

(Chorus)
