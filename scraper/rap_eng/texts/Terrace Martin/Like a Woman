[Verse 1]
I was in an empty space
Avoiding your love never gave me grace
Spending all my time away
Better to want you in retrograde

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

[Chorus]
What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm saying things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you caught me, remind me of my beating heart
I'll be your Venus if you are my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman?

[Verse 2]
Speak to me incredibly
Unfolding my arms 'til I'm in the deep
You bury me shamelessly
And leave me to want inescapably

[Pre-Chorus]
And how do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?
How do you love?

[Chorus]
What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm saying things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you caught me, remind me of my beating heart
I'll be your Venus if you are my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh

[Instrumental Bridge & Harmonization]

[Chorus]
What makes you make me feel like a woman?
I'm saying things that I thought that I wouldn't
And now you caught me, remind me of my beating heart
I'll be your Venus if you are my Mars, yeah
What makes you make me feel like a woman? Oh
