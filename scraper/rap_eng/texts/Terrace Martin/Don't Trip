[Verse: Preston Harris & Terrace Martin]
God will always love you forever
God will always love you forever
That’s as easy as this is baby
You don’t have to try so hard
This love is right there inside,  and it will never part
God will always love you forever
I came to tell you something real
No matter wherever you live
God will, I guarantee
God will always love you forever
Even with your crying eyes beautiful
Don’t let go
God will always love you forever
And don’t that feel nice
A love that never expires
A love that takes you higher
God will always love you forever
With arms open wide
Comes love reconciled
God will always love you forever
And He’s always on your side
Even when you feel alone like no one even cares
God knows
God will always love you forever
All this and I’ve been right there
Wondering who
Could ever love me
Well let me tell you
God will always love you forever
Do you know, do you know that God will
Always
Always love you?
And I tell you the truth
God will always love you forever
Forever and ever
No matter what you’ve done and what you think you do
He’s got some love for you with your name on it
God will always love you forever
He’ll never forsake when you think you made
The biggest mistake, baby it's ok
Watch what that love can do for you
Always love you forever
Love
