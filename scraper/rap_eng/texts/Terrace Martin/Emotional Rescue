[Verse 1]
Is there nothing I can say, nothing I can do
To change your mind? I'm so in love with you
You're too deep in, you can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's house
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Yeah, baby, yeah I'm crying over you

[Verse 2]
Don't you know promises were never meant to keep?
Just like the night, they dissolve off in sleep
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, baby, yeah I'm crying
Oh baby, I'm your child baby
Yeah I'm crying, crying, crying, oh baby
Like a child, child, child, ohh crying baby
Like a child, child, crying baby
Yeah, I'm crying, crying, crying

[Verse 3]
You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet Pekinese
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, I was dreamin' last night
I was dreamin', dreamin' you'd be mine
I was cryin', crying like a child, baby
Yeah I was cryin', cryin' like a child, baby
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine, all mine baby
You could be mine, mine, mine, you could be mine, baby

[Verse 4]
I'll come to you, so silent in the night
So stealthy, so animal quiet
I'll be your savior, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Yeah, you should be mine, oh mine
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
