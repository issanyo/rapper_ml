[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar]
You can fuck my bitch, you can have my ho
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can smoke that kill, you can push that dope
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can steer that wheel, hit the gas and go
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can fuck my bitch, you can have my...

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
I make a scene around me, hit the corner, heaven, hell
I come from pimpin', bangin', baby momma rockin' yayo
Was always Grandma's baby, moms always kept in veil
I swear my cousin want me bangin', settin'

[Verse 1:  ScHoolboy Q]
Nigga fuck all that, tryna go my road
I can take you back nigga, 'round '04
You can do clown dance, I'ma rob that store
You can paint your face, I'ma kick down doors
I'ma shoot my gun, I'ma free my locc
I'ma sell her tongue, I'ma tan that coke
I'ma dark my lungs, I'ma heal my soul
I'ma stack my bread, I'ma cop that boat
I'ma get them M's, I'ma whip that ghost

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar]
You can fuck my bitch, you can have my ho
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can smoke that kill, you can push that dope
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can steer that wheel, hit the gas and go
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
You can fuck my bitch, you can have my...

[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
I make a scene around me, hit the corner, heaven, hell

Say yes to dope, cop that Enz and o

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Kendrick Lamar]
You can fuck my bitch, you can have my ho
Get yours, get yours, get yours by any means
