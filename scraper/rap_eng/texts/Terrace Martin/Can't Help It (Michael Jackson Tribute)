[Verse 1]
Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind

[Verse 2]
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I cannot help but love you
It is getting better all the time

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

[Verse 3]
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles in your eyes

[Verse 4]
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I am so glad I found you, girl
You are an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no

And I am so glad I found you, girl
You are an angel in disguise

[Chorus]
I can't help it if I wanted to
I would not help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
