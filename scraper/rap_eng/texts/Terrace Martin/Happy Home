The more I give, the more you want
Is this good for the both of us?
Is it for the both of us?
Feeling like I've done enough
I just want a happy home

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
Nothing in life is free
I'd do for you, but would you do the same for me?
Always taking and never giving
My expectations are really hard to reach
So where we going?
Curtain closed, no emotion
Consider you my omen
Hindsight, I realize you've been shifting focus
My thoughts, you control them
Giving you plenty was pretty tricky
Took me for every penny
Willing to provide you with anything
You presented yourself while I was catchin' feelings
Take, you was fakin' so you could save face
Go back to where you came, from it all
What a loss, gotta pay the cost cause you're a freeloader

[Hook: JaVonte']
The more I give, the more you want
Is this good for the both of us?
Is it for the both of us?
Feeling like I've done enough
I just want a, I just want a happy home
I just want a, I just want a, I just want a happy home

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
Your lease about to end in a year
All the building we did
How do we co-exist?
Opportunist you hear
Your intentions to be here today was a higher bid
Still, with no intentions to buy
Actin' like you was riding with me
When you was really surviving off mine
I shouldn't even be surprised, blind to it, now I'm
Heart broken, living for the moment
Posing 'til you got what you wanted
Situation was sold, but it's over now
And you're on the move
Only the loyal kind win, that's necessary
Here but it's temporary
Knowing you wasn't ready to be real
So you kept me guessing
Without a way to clean up the mess that you left me
The renter

[Verse 3: Terrace Martin]
Now you get all the respect
Invested forever, check you out, you the best
Together we endeavor toward the future, I'm blessed
To have met the woman who'd never let me settle for less
You're down for the long haul, well, me too, boo
We connected, you're genuine, a vessel for truth
Everything within my being I can share with you
Fully prepared for whatever, whether money or food
It's no longer mine, it's ours
It's 50-50 surrounded by unconditional love
I found that I ain't too proud to give it sincerely to you
Cause you go out of your way, you're faithful
I'm really grateful that you're staying, the buyer
