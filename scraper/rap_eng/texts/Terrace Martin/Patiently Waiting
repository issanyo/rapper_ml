[Verse 1]
It’s been a long time since I held your hand
Girl I've been waiting turn like this I don’t understand
But I'm patiently waiting for you to come home
Where your love still stands strong
So let’s try again till we get it right
Tonight is the night Let me hold you tight

[Chorus]
Coz it’s been a long time since you’ve been here
And I'm patiently waiting for you to come home
Back again
Hooooo

[Verse  2]
Night time is the right time to be with the one you love
But doing what I do ain’t no telling will I'm gonna
Be home to you
Till sometime you get worried
You think I'm out there doing what to do?
And all I'm doing baby is working
So I can spend my life with you

[Chorus]
it’s been a long time since I smelled Josie
I'm patiently waiting for the time to come again
Girl I need you  I need you here with me
That’s why I'm patiently waiting for you to come home again.
