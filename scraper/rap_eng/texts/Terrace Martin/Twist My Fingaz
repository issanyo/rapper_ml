[Pre-Hook]
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside

[Hook]
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands

[Verse 1]
Why all these rap niggas wanna be bloods?
Never see them in the hood only see them in the club
Ask Snaz I snuck in with the snub, and I just left the block
Had the homies say I'm dumb
What's up with that, shit
Nigga I don't fuck with that, shit
I'm 'bout to pull a Suge Knight and press the issue on sight
The real bloods either get a check or we own your ass
I went to sleep flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low cut and wear my socks like a cholo
I coulda got a Ghost but I went and got a Lo-Lo
Cause copying off you rap niggas is a no no
I can hop out solo, tucked is a 4-4
I probably need three more, cause these niggas is emo
And see my altitude, they have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?

You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride

Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside

I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands

[Verse 2]
Hold up, I really got something to say
I'm the only one who made it out the West without Dre
I'm the only one that's about what he say
The only one that got hit and was walking the same day
I tried to pop first, got popped back
Got hit in the hip, couldn't pop back
Pass me y'all Buddha strap
You know we pop that, so please
Don't call me no rap nigga (Why?)
Cause I be in the spot strapped nigga
All facts nigga, I don't wax nigga
You put Compton, I put Bompton on the map nigga
I heard they wanna do a background check
I got a mil in the cut, that's a background check
(Damn) and watch how they count my pockets
And get mad when I hit them with the "I ain't got It"
Gave you the game, now you think you popping
Alright fuck y'all, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out...
