[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real (x4)

{Verse 1}
I promise that I know you very well
Even if you lied when I couldn't even tell
If you wanted what's best and kept it real
Wanted an out just couldn't get the feel
Of livin' in that world that come with plan A
You never needed B cause A was a guarantee
And plan C you never had to think of what it was
All I know is since your last dude you hate love
You hate him, you hate when you hate her
You hate so much even all of my love hurts
You hate your feelings when I treat you like a queen
You hate when you might not fit inside your jean
You hate that tip of the trip you paid for
You hate ..... but I wonder who paid more
You hate my hand whenever you need help
So what's this love got to do with it if you still hate yourself?

[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real (x3)
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

{Verse 2}
I promise that I know you very well
My homie till' I die plus we both fell
In that same situation that comes stale
We both sell green and we gotta pay that bill
We livin' in that world that come with plan B
Cause plan A can only make another mistake
We both tried having success to plan C
But it all crumbled glad you don't hate me
But you hate them you hate when you hate her
You might wanna love but all of that hate hurts
You hate having no cars and presidents old
You hate when these fast women try to take control
Of everything you might love, but you hate beef
You hate these streets you hate duckin' police
You hate the 8 hood, might even hate it to death
So what's this love got to do with it if you still hate yourself?

[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real (x3)
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

{Verse 3}
The reason why I know you very well
Is we all hate our situation can't you tell?
The day we all try to cover up and conceal
Our pride it only makes it harder to deal
When livin' in my world don't have a plan B
I can't do A cause A ain't for free
And plan C is an exaggeration like a buzz
I'm a little buzzed up but I'll tell you about love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much even though the love hurt
I love first verse you the girl I fell for
I love second verse you the homie I'd die for
Burning like my desire for hip hop and rap
I'd die for the both of you so I guess it's a rap
I love that so much I don't love anything else
But what's this love got to do with it if  I still hate myself?
Now it's not to the point where I hate everything I do love
I just hate that my life is inside a drug
And she might hate me for using without reason
He might hate me for selling out a whole season
Should I hate myself whenever I ball out?
Should I even care about the streets we talk about?
Hatin' money, power, respect in my will
Cause even with that, that shit don't make me real

{Outro}
And you know. The day that we realize that. The only thing really real is God. And he's the only one who's gonna have your back in the end. People killin' stealin' all of the above. But if you ain't got that you ain't got nothing

[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real (x3)
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)
