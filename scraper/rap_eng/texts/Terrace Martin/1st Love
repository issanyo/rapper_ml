I grew up on Wonder Years. She was Saved by the Bell
I was Boyz in tha Hood. She was ATL
Used to sell weed to her roommate, that's how we met
Old girl didn't smoke, but she had jokes on deck
No disrespect. It's just the way it was
She clowned cause I was broke and always said Cuz
I would clown her for always saying Shorty and Yall
She smiled every time I did my little Southern drawl
Calls became frequent, we'd hang out on the weekend
Started feeling like she's the one Ive been seeking
Didn't take it far. Third base at most
Never sealed the deal, but came real close
I knew that if I hit it, I would have to stay committed
And I was young, 21, man I just wasn't with it
Knew what was coming, and you can't run from it
When a feelings that strong between a man and a woman

She said she wanted more than a friendship
But I wasn't willing to bend
I said I wanted friends with benefits
But I was only trying to pretend
I didn't want you (want you), need you (need you)
Really wanna make you mine
I would never mislead you, look at how I treat you
But girl, you gotta give me some time

So the first time we did it, it was alright
But soon I was creeping to her room every night
Something like magic, I felt I had to have it
Just the right fix to kick my chick habit
You know its always better when youre lovers and close friends
It started getting deep. I kind of felt closed in
I went out and made a stupid mistake
I stopped returning calls, went on a few dates
Of course it got back to where I knew she'd be hurt
But she didn't even trip and that made me feel worse
She showed me all that love after I did her dirt
Now I'm feeling like Im the scum of the earth
She left for break, and didn't leave her number
I thought about her every single day that summer
A sucker, for trying to keep it on the under
Said next time I see her, I'mma tell her that I love her

[Hook]

But girl, you gotta give me some time

Woulda swore I was student the way I was waiting
For the new semester to begin
The very next day I ran up to campus
And ran into one of her friends
I made small talk; I didn't want to seem lame
Or too anxious, but when I said her name
The tears came. She started to break down
I can still see the look on her face now
Through the tears, I could hear Drunk driver
Crash, accident, there were no survivors
She trying to continue to describe it
But just couldn't take it and she ran off crying
Lying if I said I wasn't filled with regret
I cried for three hours sitting down on them steps
But even though youre gone, your memory lives on
And for all I did wrong, I dedicate this song
To my first love
This for my first love
