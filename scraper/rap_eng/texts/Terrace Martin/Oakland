[Verse 1]
You know you should know that I love you
You should come back home sing
My heart is in you it’s in you babe
Nothing new babe

[Chorus]
We know what happened in Oakland
Remember Oakland baby ‘coz you know
But the love you make is real
Can’t be lying my heart keeps crying
When I'm in Oakland and I'm in Oakland
Ooohhh

[Verse 2]
Couldn't keep fighting but I get tired of it when I'm in Oakland
That I want you back babe
Said I want you back and that you’re proud of what I did
But I'm not too proud to be back in Oakland
I'm so sorry
I know (I know) she’ll have known that if I left and
Couldn’t come back now
I know I hurt us I hurt you
I hurt you
Hmmm

[Chorus]
What happened in Oakland
Think of Oakland now
You know what happened in Oakland
Think of Oakland now
Letting hold you somehow

[Verse 3]
Can’t keep lying my heart keep crying when I'm in Oakland
When I'm in Oakland
Can’t keep fighting but I get tired and they were not in Oakland
Never meant to make you cry
Never meant to say goodbye
I gotta keep holding on coz love’s so strong
Better don’t you walk away
Don’t walk away (don’t walk away)

[Outro]
Goodnight again please stay
I can do better
I can do better this time
Ooohhh ahhhh
Oakland
Said I'm sorry babe ooohhhh
Ooohhh yeah
