What you say hammer? Proper

[Intro]
Where are the real women? (8x)

[DJ Quik]
This raps grand national
Dj Quik and Jon B

[DJ Quik]
I ain't down to Earth I'm in a stratus and I love it
Too many broke haters in the city not above it
Yea I'm self-made, that's a scholar
If you didn't listen one in one thousand gettin' free
Where is your tuition
I think I need a maid
Cuz I'm kinda getting paid
And I don't feel like cleaning up
I'm going through a phase
So I look for all my days
To be enjoyed with a women like me so..

[Jon B & DJ Quik]
Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies)
Show me the real women (Where are you ladies)
Where are the real women? (Where are you ladies)
Show me the real women

[DJ Quik]
I drink Pellegrino water guess it's something about the bubbles
Do you want the simple life or do you want trouble?
Do you want the hood or do you want the good?
And don't you wanna be treated like classy women should?
No imitation Louie, Diamonds like Club Louie
Closet overflowin' all Jimmy Choo's shoey
Float you like a buoy
Spend without a limit
I'm seeking out the woman that them other women mimic
So Proper

[Jon B & DJ Quik]
I need a proper girl (Proper)
Proper love (Proper)
Proper touch (Proper)
And someone, with a proper smile (Proper)
Proper style (Proper)
She got class
Proper Woman

[Jon B & DJ Quik]
Where are the real women? (Where you at?)
Show me the real women (Where you is?)
Where are the real women? (Where you be baby?)
Show me the real women


[DJ Quik]
..and furthermore
I give you space let you breathe
Won't be tugging at ya sleeve
I ain't peeking in your phone
I'm mature, I'm grown
And although you got your flaws
We won't make that an issue
I take you to the mall and hold this Louie purse against you
See how it match your shoes and how it change ya mood
All your girlfriends see me as a really player dude
I show up to your job with the keys to something new
And leave you hella happy that's exactly what I do
The world calls me Q
But my letter don't work unless it's followed by a "U"
You, will never find love in the club
No, neither will I too
And that's cool
I'm just being me, baby this is what it do


[Jon B & DJ Quik]
I need a proper girl (Proper)
Proper love (Proper)
Proper touch
And someone (Woman)
Proper style (Proper)
She got class (proper)
Proper Love
Proper Women

Where are the real women? (Where you at)
Show me the real women (Where you is)
Where are the real women? (Where you is)
Show me the real women


[DJ Quik talking with Jon B background vocals]
