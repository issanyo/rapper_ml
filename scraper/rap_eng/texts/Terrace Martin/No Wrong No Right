[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
No wrong no right
Don't know why it's so hard to let go
We should've called the quits a long time ago
Feeling like we both get a half alone
I could do bad on my own
Even laying next to you it don't feel right
Expectations are too high
I'm not meeting yours you ain't meeting mine
All I really wanted was a happy life
So baby can we please sign?

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
All of this back and forth
Don't really run this course
At first we were so supportive
Now we treat each other like a couple of orphans
Dysfunctional everything
We build this outta order
No hopes of getting better
If this is whatcha wanna do I might al well let'ya
Perfect novel baby I refuse to settle
I medicate myself but ain't no numbing this pain
Studio on a plane but really ain't no escape
Still calling home through
For whatever's worth
I'm sorry it's too late for all of that now
And that's when the fighting starts
You say things I say things too
We let our pride get the best of us
This ain't what people in love do

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Girl it's your sign and then my sign
Girl it's your sign and then my sign
It's true
No wrong and no right

[Verse 2: Terrace Martin]
So baby can we please stop?
All of this back and forth stepping
There's no moving forward
See our relationship died a long time ago
It's like a ship I couldn't keep afloat
I hear that love predicts all things but now you and me
Different day same song
We are not in sync
I turn the music loud
See if I could tune it out
Too many reminders we ain't working out I said
I said love don't hurt but emotions do
Tried to keep it cool should've kept it moving
But I can't refuse it wanna see us happy
Wanna see you happy even if it's without me
That's real

[Hook]
