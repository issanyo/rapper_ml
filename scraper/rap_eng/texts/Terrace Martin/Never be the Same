[Intro: JR Castro]
You know what I want you to do
Keep Coming
Don’t stop

[Chorus: JR Castro]
Till you can't come no more
Oooh Baby
Till you can't come no more
Bet ya that I can drain ya
Till you lose your mind
Followed by your voice
On a mission to keep you moist

[Pre-Chorus: JR Castro]
Till you can't come no more
No more
Can't come no more

[Verse 1: JR Castro]
Do you like R Kelly?
Hit you with that 12 play
Give each other head
Listen to Sade Sweetest Taboo
Send you to outerspace
Like its your Independence Day
Till I Break all your records girl
Ooo it’ll be our anniversary

[Pre-Chorus: JR Castro]
But it will never be the same again
I sincerely apologize
But it will never be the same again
Once you hit this crack you’ll be coming right back
Back to back

[Chorus: JR Castro]
Till you can't come no more
Ooh Baby
Till you can't come no more
Bet ya that I can drain ya
Till you lose your mind
Followed by your voice
On a mission to keep you moist

[Pre-Chorus: JR Castro]
Till you can't come no more
No more
Can't come no more

[Verse 2: JR Castro]
Do like 112?
Peaches and cream Anywhere
Gotta have you like oceans 12
Your water splashin everwhere
Show you im the heavyweight
I got the title .......CHAMPION

[Pre-Chorus: JR Castro]
You think you Can handle all of this
But it will never be the same again
Same again
But it will never be the same again
Keep your legs shakin from this love makin
Body Breaking

[Chorus: JR Castro]
Till you can't come no more
Ooh Baby
Till you can't come no more
Bet ya that I can drain ya
Till you lose your mind
Followed by your voice on a mission to keep you moist
Till you can't come no more
No more
Can't come no more
