[Hook: Terrace Martin]
I'm the realest nigga here, nigga
Take a picture while I'm here nigga
Throw that money in the air nigga
Atelier's all I wear nigga
You can smell a nigga winning
And you can see a nigga livin'

[Verse 1: Terrace Martin]
Toast, from day one we came a long way
I'm in it for the long haul, I take no breaks
You never see me sweat because I'm always
Focused on stacking, gamble takin' chances
Tryna be bigger than what my mama imagined
Smashing through the jungles, see the homies was brackin'
Yup, but on the other side my environment same sirens same riders
I redefine what dope is don't believe the hype
Spraying and ringing they weak these niggas is jiving
All lies, we wine and dine
You niggas out of your element go and tell 'em Dom

[Hook: DOM KENNEDY]
I'm the realest nigga here, nigga
Take a picture while I'm here nigga
Throw that money in the air nigga
Platinum Chanel is all I wear nigga
You can smell a nigga winnin'
You can tell a nigga livin'

[Verse 2: DOM KENNEDY]
They talk it I did it
They lost it I get it
Tell them little niggas be cautious I'm with it
Porches I'm with it, the horses come with it
Sixteen bars the choruses come with it
Married to the game but divorces come with it
Jealousy, envy of course it come with it
Sittin' right with it, nigga gettin' nice with it
That's my old shit I was just being light with it
I'm buying all these girls drinks for the night with it
I can't take her with me I ain't bein' tight with it
Third row in Vegas see me at the fight with it
So exit Crenshaw and make that fuckin' right with it

[Hook: Punch]

I'm the realest nigga here, nigga
Take a picture don't be scared nigga
Throw that money in the air nigga
You in the presence of a rare nigga
And don't be mad a nigga winnin'
When you see a nigga livin'

[Verse 3: Punch]
Don Corleone chromosomes
Sierra Leone diamonds I call them blood stones
No conflicts when I got 'em on
Oblivious to niggas I'm in my own zone
Lost in the sea of monotony
It's all the same I understand it's psychology
The rearview mirror is always clearer
Than the windshield, there ain't no future in the past
You lookin' back still
Whether good or bad it happened and it's over
And that's real
Time moves forward get off the treadmill
I overstand you understand still

[Hook: Terrace Martin]
I'm the realest nigga here, nigga
Take a picture while I'm here nigga
Throw that money in the air nigga
Platinum Chanel is all I wear nigga
And don't be mad a nigga winnin'
And you can see a nigga livin'
