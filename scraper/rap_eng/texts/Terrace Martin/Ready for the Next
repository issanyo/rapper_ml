[Chorus]
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
It's all about respect, yeah (about respect)
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
Talk about the past, I'm relentless (I'm relentless)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready for the next

[Verse 1]
I come from the rubble and I (and I)
Know about struggle and I (and I)
Know when it ain't much left (left)
Like how we gon' feed ourselves? (ourselves?)
How we gon' pay these bills? (bills?)
I want my family straight (straight)
Gotta give more than most (most)
I gotta be more than great (great)
I'll make it through, no time to lose
[?] life (life)
Practice more and give my all
Until I get it right (right)
And do what it takes to be (be)
The better me (me)
And win a championship (championship)
And make history
Krizzle

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
It's all about respect, yeah (about respect)
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
Talk about the past, I'm relentless (I'm relentless)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready for the next

[Verse 2]
I'm on a higher level (level)
Despite the negative vibes (vibes)
Dodging hate and confusion (confusion)
Tryna stay alive (alive)
Tryna keep my vibes (my vibes)
Tryna heal my wounds (my wounds)
Tryna up my worth (my worth)
I gotta pay my dues (my dues)
I need to see this through (through)
For all the nonbelievers (nonbelievers)
That didn't think I'm all (I'm all)
Now I'm an overachiever (overachiever)
But look how they greet ya (they greet ya)
I hope you make it too (too)
I'm just tryna win (win)
When they want me to lose (lose)
Krizzle

[Chorus]
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
It's all about respect, yeah (about respect)
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
Talk about the past, I'm relentless (I'm relentless)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready for the next (for the next)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
