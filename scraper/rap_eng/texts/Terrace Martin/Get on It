[Chorus: Bad Lucc]
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it
Let's go

[Post-Chorus: Bad Lucc]
I bet you like that
Mean when I bite back
I bet you like that
Mean when I bite back
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
I ain't scared, I'ma fight back, yeah
Take this money, get the hell away from me

[Verse 1: Bad Lucc]
Linda, Keisha, Michelle and Donna
Got a bag for Monique, a bag for Fonna
I got a bag for Dolce, bag for Ronda
Bag for CeCe, a bag for Vonda
Got a bag for Mani, bag for Deb
I got a bag for celebs, got a bag for 'em
I got a bag for more, a bag for lo
Got a bag to show, so I can bag some more

[Chorus: Bad Lucc]
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it
Let's go

[Post-Chorus: Problem]
I bet you like that
Mean when I bite back
I bet you like that
Mean when I bite back
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
Gon' shake it like you tryna get loose on me
Here's your shot, girl, take that
[?] in front of me, just like ahh

[Verse 2: Problem]
Turn it round for me, drop it back, bend it over
Baby, I just wanna fuck, don't wanna kiss, don't wanna hold ya
But I got a couple things that I really need to show ya
But I might get money, ain't got time to get to know ya
So baby, like what's up? Girl, what's up?
Oh baby, let me grab that, back it back, back
Lord knows that's a fat fat, that's a fat, fat
Oh, look at that, that, look at that, that, oh

[Chorus: Bad Lucc]
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it
Let's go
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Get on it, get on it, get on it, get on it, get on, get on it
Let's go
