[Verse 1]
Yeah
Hey, I remember when
I remember when I was just a kid
I was just a kid tryna get big
Now I'm gettin' big, gettin' real big, ooh
Play another gig, droppin' new shit
Yeah, buncha bullshit, problems still exist
Damn, tryna figure out how to live without
Yeah, gotta shake it off, gotta get it out
Yeah, when I get it I'll give it all away
Ha, when they not involved, niggas gon' hate
Ha, I don't fuck wit' y'all niggas anyway
Naw, I just pray that I'll make it home safe
Aw, yeah

[Chorus]
La da da da da (la da)

Everyday a little more pressure
I'm goin' do ome real shit

I be goin' through some real life shit
I been goin' through some real life shit
Yeah, I been goin' through some real life shit

[Verse 2]
Man, I want some mo'
I got to make, money everyday
We can't even relate, uh uh, no way
These hoes up in my face
Get out, my face
Hennessy wit' no chase
Man they throwin' my case
On my heart and my soul, dawg we gotta get paid
Gotta get out my crib, I'm tryna cop me a new one
Tryna cop my mom a crib, my daddy one too
Mo' money to the court, I been livin' in debt
I got my homies and my sistas and they all need my help
I'm tryna make up my mind, I gotta make a decision
I'm just a regular nigga, on an irregular mission
Tryin' tell 'em like

[Chorus]
La da da da da
Nigga it's more than the music, shit
(La da da da da da da da) I be goin' through some real life shit

[Verse 3]
Fuck it! Spend my last on some drugs
I'm hittin' up all my plugs, I'm goin' out to the clubs
My rent is due on the first, I keep on breakin' my phone
Tickets on my car window
I can't take this shit no mo'
I ain't thinkin' about you
Way too focused on my dreams
I need less of what I want, I want more of what I need
Listen up, I got a little confession
I got some problems wit' women
I just be tryna get in 'em
Don't really wanna be wit' 'em
I can't be catchin' no feelins'
Thank God I ain't got no children
Because I'm still tryna figure out if I'm livin' right

[Chorus]
La da da da da (la da)
La da da da da da da da (la da)
Everyday a little more pressure
I'm goin' through some real shit
La da da da da
It's more than the music
(La da da da da da da da) I be goin' through some real life shit
I been goin' through some real life shit
I been goin' through some real life shit

[Verse 4]
Shit

Never knew enough
Now I'm mannin' up
I done had enough
We the human race
Fuck Donald Trump
And that nigga's son
Say it to they face

[Chorus]
La da da da da
I be goin' through some real life shit
(La da da da da da da da) I been goin' through some real life shit
Nigga it's more than the music

(La da da da da) I be goin' through some real life shit
(La da da da da da da da) I been goin' through some real life shit
It's more than the music

Take a deep breath, nigga hold up (shit)
