[Intro]
Look here
Life should be a party
And love should be a session;
Our love
Welcome to the after party;
Sho' is glad ya' here!
Sho' is glad ya' here!
Woo!

[Verse 1]
Never had ambitions in the world
To be a great big superstar
Still wanna get money out the ass
Ride around in them gangsta cars
And it don't take much to get me through this crazy world
I may splurge on diamonds and pearls
But I'm still just a simple girl
See I
(Toast 'em high, put it in the wind!
Makes me numb, so I feel Heaven!)
Pray to God that He leads my way!
Thank the Lord for another day
And I
(Try to find my lyric in song
Hold the melody, make it last long)
Oh, 'cause life's too short to be
Caught up in all that goes wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
See, 'cause all I want
Is to live my life
Be free, stay fly
Oooh

[Chorus]
They say life is a party!
If it is, then we might as well
Dance until the DJ won't play another song
Oh!

[Bridge]
'Cause the world just keeps on spinning
'Round and 'round
Whether your ships going good
Or going down
And the birds, they keep on chirping in the trees
Because they have everything and so do we
And so do we
So do we
So do we

[Refrain]
Do things that make the whole world sing!
Spread love
Live without hating!
Do you no matter what they say!
Live your life!
[Repeat 4x]
