[Hook]
I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

[Verse 1]
I'm in a two-door
I'm in a new lane
I'm counting new money
I need a new name

[Hook]
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

[Verse 2]
They moving too slow
We on a new plane
So high it ain't funny
Your love is insane

[Hook]
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything

[Outro]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh my nigga?
This RockABye, I run, my nigga!
