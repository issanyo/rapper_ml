[Intro: Terrace Martin & Will Roush]
You and me, that's not good enough it could be
Us and we having fun, celebrating, come and see
[Will you let me, I'm Will Roush, will you let me have a good time, come on man!]
Take your time and go back, the best things in life are free

[Verse 1: Will Roush]
Let's have a good time, unwind
Yes I'm feeling as fine as the sunshine
Pants sagging in the Volkswagen, no crime
Just shagging and getting mine
I'm the man, baby, don't you agree? Yeah
Want the best of the best, come with me
Everything about Will Roush is free
Free time, free mind, free CD?
No, gotta recoup
Test flung, I be feelin' like a wife snoop
I want a brand new Benz and a ben coop
With a Pimms cup filled with a smoothie made from fresh fruits with a straw in it
Oh man, I'm all finished, the rap game I'm all in
The best things in life are free go get it

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
You and me, that's not good enough it could be
Us and we having fun, celebrating, come and see
Take your time and go back, the best things in life are free

[Verse 2: Will Roush]
I'm the true Big Willie 'cause spending's what I do
Taking trips to over seas, you could bring your whole crew
And I could bring my whole crew and we could do what it do
Fresh fruits, Gucci suits and a little grey goose
Oh we can sit on back (back), recline and relax
Watch the California sunset with me and T. Mat
Or go down to the A and chill with Stat
I got a gang of home boys for your girls in the back

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
You and me, that's not good enough it could be
Us and we having fun, celebrating, come and see
Take your time and go back, the best things in life are free

[Verse 3: Terrace Martin]
Yeah, I say step to the left (left) and step to the right (right)
Wave your hands in the air if you're feeling alright
I say step to the left (left) and step to the right (right)
Wave your hands in the air if you're feeling alright

[Chorus: Terrace Martin]
You and me, that's not good enough it could be
Us and we having fun, celebrating, come and see
Take your time and go back, the best things in life are free

[Outro: Terrace Martin]
You and me, that's not good enough it could be
Us and we having fun, celebrating, come and see
Take your time and go back, the best things in life are free
