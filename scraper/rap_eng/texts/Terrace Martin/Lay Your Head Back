[Intro: Problem & (Chris Brown)]
If you're ready for a real nigga, baby, please come up, come on (yeah)
If you're ready for a real nigga, baby, please come up, come on
Wassup, baby? (Oh, woah)

[Verse 1: Problem]
Once I unzip, it won't conflict, no no, no red light, let's go
Right where we need to, wanna eat you, prepared your feeble
Uh, you prepared your feeble, your man gone shit, I'm tryna see you
When he leave, yeah, I'ma swing through, I'ma bring a little drank, little drugs girl
You already know what this gon' lead to and I'ma do what I need to
Girl, them tights so see-through, go 'head and take 'em off, bounce on me 'til you make it soft
Fuck the condom, I'm going raw, oh yeah, yeah, I'm off of my drugs and you know that
Phone ringing, fuck her that's a throwback, that's a new thang, and I'm looking for a brand new boo thang

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
So lay your head back, wassup, baby?
Spread both of your legs, baby, so lay your head back
Come on, girl, let me deep inside ya, so lay your head back
And just let it come on down, I got you, baby, just let it come down, ooh

[Verse 2: Problem & Chris Brown]
Fuck in the house, we could do it in public, feel it drip when I rub it
I'm inside and you love it and you ain't even trip, when you found out I fucked on your cousin
But that was a long time ago, your body cold, I'ma wear it out like a designer coat
Pop that thing from the deep, oh, you won't find a young nigga with a wilder stroke
For real, oh, woah, has his own career, smoke this joint right here
While we riding round to Aaliyah, your man a bitch, Madea
So I know why you fucking with me now
'Cause I'm hitting and licking that cat 'til that motherfucker meow (meow)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Tank]
So lay your head back, will you tell me all the freaky things you are?
Spread both of your legs, baby, so lay your head back
Come on, girl, let me deep inside ya, so lay your head back
And just let it come on down, I got you, baby, yeah, just let it come down, ooh
You gotta give me something, babe (so lay your head back)
Lay your head back, lay your head back
Lay, baby, lay, baby, lay (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Can I take over from here? Head back, your head back, baby

[Verse 3: Tank]
Go to the bathroom, go wipe that thing down, lay down, I got you, my time's in charge now
Lick it up, lick it up, 'til you fall out, beat it up, beat it up, make you call out
Sit it up, sit up, out of my mind, when enough is enough, I wanna hear you scream and shout
Shit's about to get real, thirsty and I need water
Gonna need a refill, drinking all of your water
How you know what to do? Tell me, baby,who taught ya?
Tell 'em, girl, what it do, tell 'em Teezy taught ya

[Outro: Chris Brown]
So lay your head back
