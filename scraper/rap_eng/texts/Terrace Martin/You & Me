[Verse 1: Preston Harris]
Now I'm sure if we could
Understand the beatings
Like a marching band inside the art
Of every voice and piece
The melody,that speeding chord
Hold it all in; its really the heart

[Bridge: Preston Harris]
I know it'd just be simple girl
Coulda started that way
If it started with love
What are you gonna do?
I'm right here where you are
& I'm playing my part
Harmonizing with yours
And its perfect

[Chorus: Preston Harris]
That's all we know
Is you & me
That's how they'll know
Its you & me
So lets show them growth
That's how we grow
Just you & me
I'm giving the world
To you baby, driving me crazy

[Verse 2: Preston Harris]
Now I'm sure if we
Could speak in tapestry
And record the dream of our consciousness
We would reveal the secrets of our life and mind
And live in perfect peace across the world

[Bridge 2:Preston Harris]
I know it'd all be simple girl
Wouldn't have to wait
There'd be no heart to break
What are you gonna do when all you can is trust me?
Do you have the strength?
Are-are you gonna wait ? Forever is too late

[Chorus:Preston Harris]
That's all we know
Is you & me
That's how they'll know
Its you & me
So lets show them growth
That's how we grow
Just you & me
I'm giving the world
To you baby, driving me crazy

[Bridge 3: Preston Harris]
We float around
Then we conquer the hour
Then we come to [?]
We come around
Then we figure it out
Then we come with all the power, Don't leave
Come build your destiny

[Chorus: Preston Harris]
That's all we know
Is you & me
That's how they'll know
Its you & me
So lets show them growth
That's how we grow
Just you & me
I'm giving the world
To you baby, driving me crazy
