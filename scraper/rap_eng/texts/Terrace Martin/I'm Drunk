[Verse 1:Kurupt]
Bitch I think I’m drunk

I’ve been drinking all nite and I think that I’m bout to fall down
I think that I’m drunk
Its been shot after shot and I think that I am feeling them all now, bitch I think I’m drunk
I think that I’m drunk
Half a bottle to the face fore I feel in

I need to get to the bathroom room check my pocket for my money feeling nutty its cashew damn
Bitch you got a fat ass smack it like Fat Al fuck it bitch I think I’m drunk
And now don’t give a fuck about nothing

[Chorus:J. Black]

[Verse 2:Kurupt]
And this room won’t stop moving I'm going in circles off a purple with two shrooms

Plenty of chicks and slucking tonight when the patron is up  in them right rope em to a bar she  like

Then get the fuck out my way

[Chorus:J. Black]

[Verse 3:Kurupt]
