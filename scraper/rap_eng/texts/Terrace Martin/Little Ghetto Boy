Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha' gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsiblity?

Will you spend your days and nights in the pool room?
Will you sell caps of madness to the neighborhood?
Little ghetto boy
You already know how rough life can be
'Cause you've seen so much pain and misery

Little ghetto boy
Your daddy was blown away
He robbed that grocery store
Don't you know that was a sad, sad old day?
All of your young life
You've seen such a misery and pain
The world is a cruel place
And it ain't gonna change

You're so young
You've got so far to go
But I don't think you'll reach your goal
Young man, hanging by the pool room door

Look out ...

Little ghetto boy
When, when, when you become a man
You can make things change, hey hey
If you just take a stand
You gotta believe in yourself and in all you do
You've gotta fight to make it better
You'll see how other people will start believing too
My son, things will start to get better

Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better
Everything has got to get better...
