[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Sometimes I really lose my patience
Everything is sour, uh
It's my darkest hour, uh, yeah
Sometimes I really lose my patience
But it's alright
If I got you back, uh

[Verse 1: Arin Ray]
What the hell am I supposed to do?
When everything seems like it ain't right
I'm tired of worrying about all this bullshit
I just wanna chill and get some daylight
Dealing with some shit I ain't used to
Tryna fight the pressure but it takes time
I just gotta ask what would you do?
'Cause I've had enough

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Sometimes I really lose my (Yeah yeah) patience (My oh my)
Everything is sour, uh
It's my darkest hour, uh, yeah
Sometimes I really lose my patience
But it's alright
If I got you back (Uh)

[Verse 2: Arin Ray]
See half the time, half the time, it's
The little things that make me lose my mind, yeah
A thousand ways to say a thousand words, but shit
I usually say the things that make it work, but
Why should I have to hold my breath yeah?
Why should I have to hold my breath?
'Cause the only thing they want
Is to test me now
I know you see it bae (Ohhhh)

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Sometimes I really lose (Oh my) my patience
Everything is sour, (Yeah) uh
It's my darkest hour, uh, yeah
Sometimes I really lose my patience
But it's alright
If I got you back (Uh)
