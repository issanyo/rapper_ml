(Intro: Iamsu!)
Yea
Yea
Waited my whole life for this
Yea
Uh

(Verse 1: Iamsu!)
I said I’m cut from a different cloth
Raised in a different era
Leadin' the revolution, I’m virtually Che Guevara
Shouts out to Ray Guevara
Lyrics that uses terror
He doesn’t leave my mental, I’m walkin a straight and narrow
Makin' historic music, while rockin some apparel
And labels that caused house notes
Pink dolphin tones
Feel the blim quotes, said life’s a bitch
It’s murder that she wrote
So you can find bravery in my bravado
Tryna live up to that rapper from Chicago
That hopped out of that Benz out in Prago
Spit coke and shouts out to Pablo
But I’m more of a Picasso
Fuck a hater, they could die slow
My mind stay in survival
I got a bro that ride around with the bible
Uh, and he’s far from a preacher
So I hope this message here reaches him
Uh, shit I hope this message reaches me
Me and Chief, we communicate through frequency

(Verse 2: Mani Draper)
Dismissin' the preacher where we were sprayed at
He pulled on him, she stopped him like where the bread at?
Keep it prayer with that collection, I’ll take care of that
The 1%, I can make, they ain’t even aware of that
Allow me to play Scorsese for out dearly departed
Physically hit, but that don dada won’t touch you for father
Fuck livin, born to lose, why even bother?
Too many die young, bitch I gotta go harder
Freaky set cup, to hell with remorse
The way Sue christened from dawn, I said to hell with her corpse
Stuff 'em in the door, man the truck should be big enough
All in one take, same weight, nigga fuck the part
Soon I’m to go parted, ways with my heart
Started getting closer and closer, guessing that was a start
Light 'em up, say when, watch me tear em apart
All in honor,I killed two, so don't compare us at all
Nigga
