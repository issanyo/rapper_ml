[Intro: HaLo]
There it goes
I was looking for it, there it is
There it goes
Alright, here we go
Here we go

[Verse 1: HaLo]
Scandinavian bottles and Granddaddy Kush
Immaculate wardrobes, you had to look
Fox head furs from furlough, I'm double booked
Out of town with the subtle crooks
Double Dragon action
Fire breathing the interaction
Pure satisfaction of unknown passion
Bar crashing, tire slashing, and car scratching
My heart Alaskan
Love I was never asking
Biltmore grass, I double dip in the stash
Wine tastings, I bring my own glass
Potent hash, how long the zone last
Audi 6 chrome dash
Understatement, it's fast
Talk trash and make it rhyme with great design
Black Jedi with the force
Lightsaber shine
Breathe, slow down, take your time
No race, it's an acquired taste
You should savor mine
Be the change you want to see is my favorite line
When I'm quoting Gandhi to mami before we bump and grind
Last summer we summarized our subtle rise
Suckers tried to stunt got knucklized
New born's cry, the look of a mother's eye
That's how I feel about my art
I'm always surprised and astounded by the sounds when I'm around it
Founder's fountain of youth
Drum looping, we're about it

[Bridge: HaLo]
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow

[Hook: HaLo]
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Money stink mink, with the Kissyfur

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Pretty bird flew right into my screen door
Glass look invisible
Look, peep how I'm rocking my Kangol like a HaLo
Wings of a angel, body so heavenly
I'm down to catch a felony
Especially when the melody is telling me
The recipe for flowing so steadily
Is witty unpredictably, my talent and natural game to bag a dame
Another track [?] and mane you make it sound fly
Silky, the flows is milky
Undisputed rhyme King of this mic ring
Dare a motherfucker to swing
Swords cling at the battle of the rapture
Fans that will kill you
Pretty bird scream for these microphone fiends
Legendary hip hop classic, we mastered
Burn like sulphuric for those who want to hear it

[Bridge: HaLo]
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow

[Hook: HaLo (Talib Kweli)]
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird (yeah)
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
(yeah)
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
(yeah, what!)

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
I said "smile baby" She said "I haven't smiled lately"
"It's been a while, I got trials, I feel like God hate me"
I told her "count your blessings, not your problems"
Forget all our differences, what do we have in common?
Disparities, and our similarities, cause casualties
All in her heart cavity, battling like the Maccabees
The way a mack would be
Attacking all her faculties
It's deep, I'm like Philippe's them other cats is Applebee's
She make them bow down like the Japanese
Stealing hearts like a villain notorious
So dastardly, so nefarious
My boy's dapping me, it's hilarious
Shorty on fire, like a chariot
I guess a gritty verse it meant to be
The pretty bird may could return as the phoenix, eventually
I guess a gritty verse it meant to be
The pretty bird may could return as a phoenix, eventually

[Bridge: HaLo]
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow
Say it loud, wack and you proud
Jump, scream, and shout it
Brother we don't allow

[Hook: HaLo]
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Word around town the whole city heard
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Falcon flight nights
You can give me hers
Pretty bird, pretty bird, pretty bird
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Fly into the glass when your vision blur
Money stink mink, with the Kissyfur
