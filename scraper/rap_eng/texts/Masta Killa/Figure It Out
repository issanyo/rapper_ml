[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
This is hip hop melody, we goldy sprinkles of greatness
Jazz horn trumpets spoken word instrumental
Silk suit, Cuban link cables candlelit tables
Turntable spin 9th Wonder bling classic
This Wu-Tang style that I’ve mastered, hand crafted
Utensil poison that pencil skull portrait’s
For you to picture mentally, blessed is the anointed
That punch to bring balance, serving universal justice
Reflect like the sky be blue
Peace to Zulu it’s Boom Bye Bye to your head
Respect to Buju, my ninja star ginsu
Catch me at the Bonnaroo
My mic assassin murda crew, throwing down invincible
Brother it’s the principle, respect due

[Hook: HaLo]
You need to figure it out, baby let’s figure it out
Figure it out baby, let’s figure it out
Give it a whisper, give it a shout
I figure we can figure it out, what it’s about
Figure it out baby, let’s figure it out
Figure it out baby, let’s figure it out
Give it a whisper, give it a shout
I figure we can figure it out, what it’s about

[Verse 2: HaLo]
I smelt the fire in Babylon when a kid got his travel on
9th let me tag along, miles from the vagabonds
Ventriloquism deep in the system
I never listen I was blind to the prism
Shine and glisten, a gold glitterin’ griffon
That make dreams come true but your souls are missin’
I sold missions the rise
Who rose with him, they rose a cold switching stories a old Grisham
Nose twitching a penny pinchin’
Not many listenin’ about foreseeing the vision
Chocolate crunch crown a calibration creation
Celebration of that lifetime occasion
Formulation of fornication on vacation
Safe saving my information that combination
This Obama nation my conservation’s a compilation
Momma waiting, hope she ain’t a patient
Resin is regular, our buds are better huh?
French inhale baby and taste the plethora
I rather you instead of her but
I make do with what I can, the casualties of man
Fight or flight I know you ran, drone scan
Called her from overland, they watching brother man
Fight or flight I know you ran, drone scan
Called her from overland, they watching to figure it out
Said they watching to figure it out
But never mind me, I’mma figure it out
Never mind me I’mma figure it out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Median]
Dumbed out for the free, duh
Release, dum, dum, relief
Minimalist dip the socially explicit
Implicit pure gentleman derivative raw
Breathing just to live all season fisherman
Reel them in a clip, pick, vision future tense
Edit, invent just to vent a bit
List the benefits, list the benefits
Whistlin’ a whim, more moms and a pop
More hot shots, more cop, more locks
More lax keys water hot more to rise
Order those [?] yea, go outside
More positive, acknowledge the pop more defensive
For the pisser, dignity lives here
Elegant residents say the sky’s lit
Then witness the thunder comfort where I lay the fitted

[Hook]
