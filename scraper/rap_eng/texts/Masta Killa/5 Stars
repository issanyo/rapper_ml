[Intro: 9th Prince]
Yeah, yeah
Master Allah Self Hate
Shaolin cipher heat, niggas
For my militant soldiers
Yeah, check it out, yo, yo

[Verse 1: 9th Prince]
As night falls the commando's teams seize the palace
Fiercely assault commands the volts
Explode in the air like lightning bolts
We ripping out your spleen
At battlegrounds like the dense jungles of Philippines
Drunk monk sip O.E. out the canteen
Men at war with guillotines
Safari of Japanese troops not waiting
All you hear is bullets penetrating
Deep like the assassination that almost killed Reagan
War troops in army suits with spiked boots
Lyric proof brutes camouflage the haunted igloo
Eskimo commando dressed to kill in camo
Black Rambo I civilize for ammo, bulletproof parachutes
We motorate helicopters with green bags of loot
Bloodthirst heroes after Vietnam we made the wheelchair
No fear, warfare at its highest [?]

[Verse 2: Beretta 9]
I snatch up defeated troops in desert Timb boots
Camouflage like the sands I locate in Iran
For war be the issue, elite crews and God jewels
Snipers on the rooftop, watch out for the pit bulls
We waited till sunsets and moving like ninjas
Camouflage masked avengers, y'all niggas best surrender
We servicing your weapons we be the Armageddon
Killarmy bring on board this military acquisition
Your crew will take position on the seven seas mission
Beretta 9 be wild like convicts in San Quentin

[Hook: 9th Prince]
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters

[Shogun Assassin]
Let's go to war with break beats, my battleground is in the streets
Shogun Samurai Assason the professional spectacle
Mental terrorist plant a time bomb in your ear
And hold your brain for hostage
Killarmy equipped with detonating swords
Captivate the crowd leave 'em praising the Lord
In the Asiatic War we chop heads off
Like General Monk and his swordsmen
The reason is burning season my brothers is guilty of high treason
So I decapitate them as they lay motionless bleeding on the canvas
I put away my weapon which is stainless

[Break: 9th Prince]
Yo, it's the 5 Star General

[Hook: 9th Prince]
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters

[Break: 9th Prince]
5 Star Generals, word up

[Verse 3: Dom Pachino (9th Prince)]
Here's the non-carnivorous lyricist rhyming protagonist
Absorbing thoughts through my elements rip out your pancreas
Try to exit and get caught like a venereal disease
Niggas freeze before I squeeze
It's impossible to run when I'm done
Dom Pachino the son saving my universe now awaiting trial
Unidentified profile got you sewn like a textile
Lyrical navigator exploring different worlds
Mxyzptlk style (yeah) equipped with a vest
Killarmy vigilantes got MCs marked for death
Evil targets taking their lives like Grand Auto Theft
Then motivate like Dr. David Banner
Moving in bulletproof air crews with CB scanners
I channel (Five Stars) my life can never be a manual
Unpredictable historical like a Greek oracle
Words pronounced plural and shot through my [?]

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
Science is the study of all things knowledge their sword swing
Guns go off from the east wing
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
Who's resting? You've been summoned to awaken
A nation of sleeping giants who are clients to the devil civilization
Migration expands my plan to the maximum capacity
(Five Stars) Nothing can hold me
From launching out over the Earth then disperse
Ritual darkness niggas return
Unscathed and at ease and as you were
But the thought of not being able to breathe and leave
These worldly possessions have MCs fret to step in my direction

[Hook: 9th Prince]
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters
5 Star General giving killing orders
Militant assassins surround the headquarters

[Outro: 9th Prince]
Word up, militant assassins
