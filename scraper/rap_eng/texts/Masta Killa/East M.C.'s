[Masta Killa]
All Gangsta and Fellow MC's we now meet
The Threat is now a actual fact and that's the least
The Lion paw rippin' your Jaw dismantle face piece
You may not have heard or seen
My Murder One Team, Something's best untold
Crime Related - I am who I am so fuck it if son stuck it
We all ate a plate of the best - sipped the fine Grapes
My Rugged Lifestyle is survive - I don't Apologize
Hustlin' is the road I chose, there's no Compromisin'
When the Guns is drawn, shots fired
Son, all my killers is fam, nothin' hired
Ya'll faggot niggas wired for sound, before the things blast
Wait for the Train to pass, Man face down
We straight from the Murder Capitol Town
It goes down - Daily on the regular
Dressed in Assassin attire, the bullet proof wrap
Strap 'em wit the Bomb to his body, ain't no comin' back

[Victorious]
Yea, yo these dudes out here ain't fightin' no more
You either dump or run, or go to the law
Me I take it to the further son, it's Murder One
Maneuver the rugers, I call 'em Ferguson
You force my hand, I'll take you off the Earth wit Guns
Justify Homicide that burden is done
I drink that redrum straight out the faucet, your boy lost it
I'm on the belt park where the Ratchet I toss quick
I'm a Boss Bitch from that Beast New York
Where that cheap talk get you outlined in Chalk
Step out of line, we put your thoughts on the Sidewalk
You popped your top lock like we popped the Corks
You can catch me in the South on approach wit them Choppers
Or Bring out them Helicopters
Your boy gun dame is hella proper

[K.Born]
Yea, so masterful, the flames burn hot
Comin' for the kill, faggot niggas head gets chopped
And get rolled from blocks and gets slapped out spots
We in N.Y. keepin' live Brooklyn lick off shots
Make 'em duck tuck, roll real slow don't stop
Til they get it and flock, See I aim for top
Now Y? don't ask why, just move wit my flow blow so-so
Watch how careers gets stopped
My Pop spit the seed and I swam stream, strongest and broke through
Raised by to a General - Physical is holdin' weight
And leadin' the way like a Freight Train
But I jump fast, nigga you here ? You Sure ?
Ain't no horse play, don't play
Murder wit my Minds spray
Give y'all fools lessons of war, no more
From every Land on this Planet Earth
And waters all across, truly yours, the Flames, the Force

[Free Murder]
The Name's F.R.E.E. M.U.R.D.A
My nigga, Aye! The name is Free Murda
Killings is no limit even without C-Murder
We take and keep burners, we don't give it back
It's like the Blocks slow it's hard to get rid of that
Kinda mad wishin' he should've had bigger Gat
Not this little shit could fit in my Fitted Cap
Matter of fact give 'em that, Make 'em do somethin'
But really though yo he ain't gon' do nuttin'
Bangin' me, I popped your bitch and now she shot up
The Name is Free and that's the opposite of locked up
I have you wacked up, they call the Cops up
You need a housing worker have that blood moped up
Yea I'm like WHAT ? wit my Glock up
I'm a nut like the shit I get off cock sucks
I just popped up and already done wit you
Should've bring your Pops hop, the way I been sonnin' you
Came wit your thing, you can't fight you'se a lame nigga
Under the wing like lights on the Plane Nigga

[Killa Sin]
Yo, fuck all the small talkin'
Get on your job or get the walkin'
Major League Batters in here, you steady balking'
The Mack maul cats like dogs or botched abortions
Make blood pour like bottles of bubbly popped the corks on
The war's on
Better believe I get my Stalk on
+Artist of The Year+ enjoy the fall - long
BONG! when it's all said and done I be long gone
Hong Kong gettin' my Cock wopped thru my Long Johns
Same song all around the World like 'Pac did it
Caught a lil half a hundred gram wit the Cop wit it
The Grass that I stashed in the Dash, hit the Block wit it
The Glock that I brought along for the ride, got knocked with it
Now I'm up top tradin' bars with my box niggas
Wit Two Strikes against me ain't no room for the Third
Even the Cops get it, got niggas watchin' they Misses
Doin' a middle harm Legs cocked in the air
Screamin' "Yeah" like Lil John
Should've pawn like Carm styles is on potty train
Shotty's bang, bodies slained, got niggas that could get it on
