[Intro]
Perverted Monks style
'99 style, knowhatimsayin?
Coming at cha, this how we do

[Verse 1: Afu-Ra]
Paraplegic, my fighting stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much Chi horrific
To be specific, I'm coming through with jujitsu
Bone crushing bone breaking as I get into
Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damaging nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains reading scrolls
Holding it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinning kicks, side kicks and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

[Hook 2X]
It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seeing through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it moving factor
Sword swinging the temple mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bed-Stuy
Wing Chung from Lafayette, Stuyvesant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featuring Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Beez disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinning roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

[Hook 2X]
