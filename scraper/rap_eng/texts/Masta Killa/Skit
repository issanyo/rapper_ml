[Intro]
The Buddha Fist and the Lohan Fist trace from the same
Basic technique and when competing against each other there is little to choose between them
But, the followers of the Lohan style want it more
Power for themselves and used their new masterâ€™s help to eliminate all other contenders
The Buddhist style followers resisted
There was much conflict in the fighting world
