[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Man Allah has blessed my life so beautifully
Its like selfish to complain about the storms and the rain
When all life that sprang, came from the rivers that ran
Refurbishing all land, Listen
I swam to completion of self satisfaction
Wanting for nothing, at harmony with everything
Knowing that, but bring all living things
A cycle that spins 360 like Michael
An angel screaming for peace but unheard
The people were asleep in the dark
Worshiping what they know not
Easily lead to the slaughter of the butcher
Stop, look and listen
A new birth awakening
A blind baby, saying please save me
And raise me righteously

[Hook]
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
See everything is a copy or replacement for the natural
Dieing never taste so sweet
Its just the way you dress it up
See meat been dead for weeks
Blood seeps from the plastic out the freezer
It leaks till you freeze it back
Like a body, if its nots been embalmed and packed
You know the recipe, cancer disease et cetera
You might say damn son put on some weight
He looking real good, on the inside he dieing slow  like America
Then you hire brother Obama to clean your house up
What a mess generations of incest came from the cades of the west
My newly written slang, speech from the east
Brings fulfilment to each one
That I might teach one, i heat up the meal before
Serving the hungry, for those who may come
Who are worthy, to sit among the righteous
To live life

[Hook]
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be

I repeat see its all natural god its all natural
See this rhymes all natural the mic can be
No shake powder protein in my phsyique
No creatine animal meat
I repeat see its all natural god its all natural
