[Masta Killa]
{*humming the beat*}
I awoke from oppression, I began to write for y'all
Truth from a speck of light
I chose to bring belief to those
That hunger for the food of thought
Cuz this is the life we chose
Fool's gold tempt many and led 'em astray
Others watched them go down
They was afraid to speak on it
Some never recovered from the mental enslavement
I came greatness
The world wasn't ready to face me

"Never.. the God too clever.. never.. he seen it comin..
Never.. the God too clever" ] Masta Killa

Now this wicked brother Cal
Ordered them to cover their faces painted with smiles
And they came, from air, land and oceans
I watched as the sides of good and evil was chosen
Everything seemed to move in slow motion
People ran frantic as herds of wild steed
Their minds like rabbits, souls like deer, fear was felt
And when the radiation melt the eyes from their heads
I fled seeking cover to find none
Triumph a selection played by RZA
Buildings crumbled
Missiles and bullets whistled, the Earth rumbled
Water filled tunnels quickly from both ends
Trucks dropped from buildings that swayed from high winds

"They thought he would slither.." ] Masta Killa

[Masta Killa]
Trees buckled like knees
Continuing to build and break the seventh seal
From the sky came fiery hail, trains derailed
Horseman hooded with sheets shaped in concrete
War of the lion, voids thunder when I speak
From their finger came lightning, striking the beast {*thunder*}
Jail cell broken by the wise words spoken
Gun smokin'.. it's the def poet quotin'
