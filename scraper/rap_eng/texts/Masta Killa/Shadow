[Intro - Mont Jake]
I'm a - I'm a - I'm a shadow
I'm a - I'm a - I'm a shadow

[Verse 1 - Mont Jake]
I'm a shadow
Sucking light from the ground
Born from a window
Giving hope a taste of gloom

[Verse 2 - Mont Jake]
I'm a shadow
Following light in sorrow
My moment will be found
As I lay on the ground

Verse 3 - Masta Killa]
P Gordon
Yo Cruz we taking big money this year

Iâ€™m on a private Island to record my album
Out of the shadow, gonna roll a platinum
Somewhere out in the West Indies
Laid back chilling under the palm
On private beaches, blowing trees
Pitch up in the shadow of a top model
Or be in a shadow, in the shadow
Like Carlo Gambino, over the shoulder of Frank Sinatra
All the mobsters in the shadows, getting money
Nah, we ain`t braggin'
We just stacking plenty of paper
Blowing the vapour
All in the maker, shadow lover
Mary Jane girl, shadow dancer
Im a Leo, she`s a Cancer
Rich dinero, [?] you can call me Theo
Wait that don`t sound like Killa flow
Motherfucker my flow is that cash flow
I need a hundred a show
That's what I came for
If ya`ll can`t afford me, ya`ll won`t see me
Only on TV, or out of the shadow
Sick apparel, double barrel
Flame and arrows
Have gun, will travel
When I speak you know it's heat
My shadow technique can never be beat
Don`t push on me as far as green that makes your head spin When you [?]

[Verse 4 - Mont Jake]
I'm a shadow
Following light in sorrow
My moment will be found
As I lay on the ground
