[Intro: Masta Killa]
Uh, Y'all niggas should have some of this shit right here boy
It's that good shit
Uh, it's just...1-2, 1-2, replace the beat
A-yo; a-yo, check-a, check-a, check-a
Check it out
Uh, motherfucking

[Verse 1 Masta Killa]
I was feeling lovely, pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction mad slow
Thinking, should I step to the motherland?
And rep who? The Wu-Tang Clan
Another thing, beyond the fam I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on the blunt tip
It's been two weeks since I last sparked
Stepped in the Grand Resort
$25 Dollar fee, plus I.D
But a brother like me Executive V.I.P
Word! Took a bar seat
Had a tall glass of Hennessey and Peach
She turned to my left, seen this chick, she was slamming
What you do kid? I examined her
Pushed up, tried to bag her for her name
What happened? I didn't have the..
Overwhelmed by the scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yea, Ha ha
It was Startel The God Jamel, he had a bone
A blunt of that ill shit
I said, "pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone"
He passed it, took one pull, I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fantastic
Reapproached the weak cypher
Did you surprise her? Tranquilized her
Bagged her for her name and address
Slid to the rest, achieved mad success
Ha ha, yeah

[Hook: Startel God Allah]
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Flyest broads, hottest cars
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Hottest bars, fuck you frauds

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
I was at a night club, shorty grilling with the mean mug
Ain't showing no love, it's all good
I'm ready to float inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm, all I needed was a hydro bone
Guess who came down the block stumbling drunk?
I forget the brother name but he had some skunk
Took out the blunt, put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale ‎– without pertaining a cough
Exhale ‎– you know like two pulls and all
Stimulated kind of toxie, but don't sleep
You know we got the drop, one shot wit the heat
Some brothers be smoking that weed of the week
But never me, just strictly the Ganja
Sinsemilla in your area

[Hook: Startel God Allah]
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Flyest broads, hottest cars
We don't front, we run things
Here to tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Hottest bars, fuck you frauds
