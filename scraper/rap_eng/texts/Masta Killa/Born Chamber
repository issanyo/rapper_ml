I've taught you for three years instructing you in my Poison Clan techniques. We live here in seclusion so we can talk about the clan. The point is I had pupils once. Is that a fact? What are there names? Where are they? I don't know their names now. When they left they all took new names, as the whole idea was to keep their identities a close secret. So even they don't know each other's names. And while they were here they always wore masks to avoid being known. I worry about what there all doing. What I taught them could be used wrongly for evil to hurt men. So then I would like to make sure this hasn't been the case and you will do that for me. Teacher, how will I find them if they've changed their names? And to make it harder they won't show their skills they'll keep them hidden unless it is an emergency. If bad you must kill them
