[Verse 1: GZA]
I wiped the chrome off with the dustcloth before I bust off
What's the cost, life loss?
High price to pay for a small reward
Kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad
I provided the jumper cables through the booster mini-packs
Based on the drama unfolding in the track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth, then act upon it
Or feel the fire's full view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
Y'all niggas are like kids, flashing plastic tools
Unaware of the multi-year dynastic rule
What?! Stupid!

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Without a doubt, it's in the heart
Where the best darts were written
Sitting at the window of the Grand Old Earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
Cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wander the streets and experiment with devilishment
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode
The battlefield haunting, the daunting
Wu-Tang dance, deadly emits six pence
Spiral, rifle barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrap stifle, survival
Tribal, title - Secret Rival
Article subliminal message throwing
Bitch niggas hoeing on labels
Mic cables, capable of slowing down jets on deck
Fucking you straight through continuously
Justice, the war of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat
Drama builds, it's the street prophecies fulfilled
Bitter chill currents to the invited
Bang for the phones, live niggas on their way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn
