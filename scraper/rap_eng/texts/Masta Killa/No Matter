[Hook: Rocki Evans]
I’m tryna see what’s between your thighs
You might feel something if you just close your eyes
So good, yea you make a nigga wanna cry
No matter baby, I will fly
No matter how far, love
No matter how far you are

[Verse 1: HaLo]
Across seas, climbed over mountains
Traveller, seeker of youth fountain
News mounting we true bout it
Boo bouncing out of the blue, figured out it was you
From Kalamazoo, the walk and stare
Scare raising your hair an amazing affair
Goosebump in the moonlight blurry the glare
Giving ghosts a good reason to appear
What a mirage, weaving word collage
Even out the odds, a taste for a taste
Feel the muscles in your face relaxe
Unwind, one time, erase your whole mind
Black sand beach, fall in love with your feet
The wind whispers in your ear to creep
What you doing? Don’t speak
Words might ruin what this passion pursuing, babe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Shit you are my distant star
No matter how far I produce light
Then recite it through the rhyme mic
Receive it in the bearer of life
You are my shining diamond
I’m cosigning down payment on arrangements
To take you, mould you and shape you and date you
Why would I play you, I made you
Think it through, you and I slide in Dubai, so fly
Sipping on whatever you do, I hold the Dom P
A spliff for that OG
Watching you dance so exotic to the music
Seductively you loosen your blouse, I’m 'bout to lose it
Talking dirty lingo, we tango to the beat of the maestro
And sit back let the time flow, you know

[Hook]
