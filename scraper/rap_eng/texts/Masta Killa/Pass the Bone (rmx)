[Intro: Masta Killa]

*Inhales* Ahhhhh
Ya niggas should have some of this shit right here boy
This that good shit
Yes yes ya'll. One two, one two...
In a place to be...*coughs*
Aiyyo *coughs*
Aiyyo, check it check it check it *coughs*
Check it out

[Verse One: Masta Killa]
I was feelin lovely, pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction mad slow
Thinkin Should I step to the motherland
And and rep who? the Wu-Tang Clan
Another thang, beyond the fam I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks, since I last sparked
Stepped in the grand resort
Twenty-Five dollar fee, plus ID
But a brother like me, Executive V.I.P. Word, took a bar seat
Got a tall glass, of hennessy and peach
Turned to my left, seen this chick she was slammin
What ya do kid? I examined her
Pushed up, tried to bag her for her name
What happened? I didn't have the...
Overwhelmed, by a scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yeah, haaa
It was Startel the God Shamel
He had a bone, a blunt of that ill shit
I said pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone kid, pass the bone
Passed it, took one pull I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fan-tastic
We approached the weak cypher
Did you surprise her? tranquilized her
Bagged her, for her name and address
Slid to the rest, acheived mad success...
Ha Ha.........yeah

[Chorus: Startel God Allah]
We don't front, we run things
It'll tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Buy us broads, hottest cars
We don't front, we run things
It'll tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Hottest bars, fuck them frauds

[Verse Two: Masta Killa]
Outside a nightclub
Shorty grillin' with a mean mug
Ain't showin no love it's all good
I'm ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Mmm, all I needed was a hydro bone
And guess who came down the block stumblin' drunk
I forget the brother name but he had some skunk
Took out the blunt put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale, without pertaining to cough
Exhale, you know like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie but don't sleep
You know we got drowt one shot with the heat
So brothers be smokin that weed with the ?lite? but never me
Just strictly the ganja
?Since we mania?
In ya area

[Chorus: Startel God Allah]
We don't front, we run things
It'll tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Buy us broads, hottest cars
We don't front, we run things
It'll tell you one thing
Run through town like stars
Hottest bars, fuck them frauds
