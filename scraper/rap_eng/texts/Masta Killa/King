[Verse 1: Big Remo]
Ain’t no Bugattis round here, just a old box
Swishas on deck twistin’ up the whole box
Today was wonderful I came up on a few rack
The definition of a G bring the truth back
Yea the groove’s back I’m on the panoramic life
Nightime vision in my shades and it’s damn near night
Yea, I put a hunned on this smoke bag
Smell like an onion in this smoke bag
Get yourself toe-tagged, niggas so fast
Run up with your ass, I run up in your whole ass
No disrespect to your ass but mami want it so bad
I stick ‘em like post-its Re texas hold ’em

[Hook: Big Remo]
I’m the king, said I’m the king
Yea I’m the king of rock, there ain’t none flyer
And I won’t stop rockin’, I won’t retire
I’m the king, said I’m the king

[Verse 2: Big Remo]
It go, Kash, if you see what I’m smokin’ now
Take two and pass nigga, blow it out
I know it smell loud, but really it sweet
My spot on cloud nine y’all know I put up my feet
And I’mma have a drink, I’m on the ground black
My [?] I love her for that
I’mma call up my connect and get up on a few jars
Last time I seen her had to run a nigga two large
On that Jamaican fruit, he call it fruityard
And now it’s martian green, it gets you Bruno Mars
Yo, listen I be on that Khalifa shit
Ain’t nothing silly though, yea said

[Hook]

[Verse 3: HaLo]
Come up for air shorty, take it easy mama
You ain’t gotta impress me, slide it cooler than Gretzky
To the rules when it’s messy, keep it true would you let me
Disrespect you like how most rappers rap about in they songs
If we do get along can I Vietnam bomb
Surprise you with witty charm
Flip another response to her messages
Lessons is prerogative, prolly twist a piffery

Disappear, no forgettin’ me I’m slippery
Musician, claim I’m in need of a muse
Just an excuse for her in my swimmin’ pool
Rap perks kinda cool, never stop rhymin’ fool
Do it every day, all the time and my dude it go

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Microphone blue and the flow is so fluid
Just cool you, just some catchin’ up to it
Hot liquid drips the lyrics hit the pavement
Like daisy cutters through the basement
Taste the aftermath of my iron palm blast
My five daily [?]
Who could last the session with my Cherokee chief
See my wallaby Indian mocks
Watch me shadowbox, 52 locks blocks tomahawk
Ox chops technique street sweep
Yellow tape, white sheeps gun smoke somethin’ dead
My chess game blow you out my frame
So by any means I be the royal lion kings
Son I’ll be the royal lion king

[Hook] 3x
