Oh, I'd love to talk with you, talk with you

[Chorus 2X]

[Masta Killa]
It's a special dedication, to all of my lady friend
Whether you Caribbean, from any other island, them
I touching, on the scene, make the meanest gangsta roll lean
Gun clean, stay fresh, her breasts all natural
I'm impressed, her body all actual
She undressed, flexed, pretty round brown t'ing, from the back
Horny facts, fat, fat, fat, fat
Sexy Maxine, she fiend for the killing
Christine, she fiend for one killing
Sexy Justine, she fiend for one killing
And sip the Guiness, burn ganja weed
Look out for breed, picnic to feed
Me sip Guiness, burn ganja weed
Look out for breed, picnic to feed

[Hook 2X]
