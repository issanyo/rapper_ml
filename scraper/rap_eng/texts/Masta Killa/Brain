[Chorus: sample from "Pinky and the Brain"]
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain

[Masta Killa]
Heh, yo, party people gather round, watch the God get down
The sound's so rugged, measure the erection
It's raw when I'm sexin' your brain
Cherry cream beam leather seats, lean
Goose in the canteen, dutch leaf green
Block wit a chocolate, ship a mil', box it
Moms and pops it, plan to be seventy five, live and kicking
Jewels drip in the heat, rippin' with a young sweet
Something in the passenger seat
Ivory Queen Bee got the Old Man feeling twenty three
Power-U fat as a peach, I'm Chief Jay Strongbow
From the east, come due Allah, what a beautiful squall
Through the Cartier tints, I seen her from afar
She in her mink trench in her panty and bra
Smooth in silk, naturally built, soy milk breast
Gas at the 'hess, slit it to the rest, undress

[Chorus]
