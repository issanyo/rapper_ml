[Pre-Hook: Paul Banks]
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren

[Hook: RZA]
If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of things you would not misconstrue
Baby, let me into your heart, I want every part of you
Down to the itty bitty molecules for particles
If you just give me a chance
I'll show the god in you
We could go back to the garden and do what lovers do

[Bridge: Paul Banks]
I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread

[Pre-Hook: Paul Banks]
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren
You leave me on fire when
You lead me like a siren

[Hook: RZA]
If only you could see everything from my point of view
You would understand the truth of this and you would not misconstrue
Baby let me into your heart, I want every part of you
If you just give me a chance, I’ll show you god in you
And we could go back to the garden and do what lovers do

[Verse 1: Method Man]
You know I party like a rockstar
And you can catch me eating guppy at the shark bar
I see you Irif what up Allah U Akbar
8 million stories in the backseat of a cop car
But I don’t need to go to jail I already got bar
Cut the coke with the baking soda I rock hard
For no charge or debit we call em flash cards
We flashin money in here, call that a flash mob

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Check the dark star status, see the rhinestone jacket afar
Meth, R and P, my guitar string bleed’
Rhyme superstar on the weed
RZA-Ra striking the keys, it's like heaven sent

[Outro: RZA]
I want everything
This world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
Love in my bed
It's my daily bread
Yo I want everything
That this world can give
A nice car to drive
A nice home to live
Money in my pocket
And love inside my bed
And I praise the lord for my daily bread
We rise and roll rock and roll
Trying to find a pot of gold
To free from the strife of today’s economy
Trying to find a pot of gold
Trying to find a pot of gold
