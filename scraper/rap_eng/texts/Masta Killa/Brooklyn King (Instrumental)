[Masta Killa in Whispery Voice]
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
This is how I do my Thing

[Verse 1]
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling

Dare a motherfucker to swing
Lose arm, I'm calm stayin' heavily armed
Well protected, Heart rip cage chest is slowly plexus
Rugged Profile peep honey child checkin' my style
Quick Wallets are fuck, slick wit it talk, East New York
Get a guns buck, back them down
You know the sound, when they see auto spit fully
Baron Bully, Timberland Boot, Black Hoody, Fitted Black Skully
You still on that bullshit, I can't get it out of me
Why should I switch the Prescription ?
The Whole World vibin' to what I'm Prescibin'
Keep the Jam livin'

[Masta Killa in Whispery Voice]
Ding, ding, ding, ding
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing

[Hook: Masta Killa]
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling
Dare a motherfucker to swing
You know his Thing
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding

[Verse 2]
Uh, we ain't goin' home 'til the last blood's gone
Head strong enough to break Bone
Peace to the God y'all boned
Tell Universe to love and scent
Missed seein' him on the Ave. a little longer and bent
Yea it's another day in the Hood
I got my Money from the Block
Now I'm gon' cop somethin' fly
To rock for the rest of the Week
Prefer heart, not the drop slippin' of to the beat
Not the sweet smellin' sex in my Passenger seat
Pretty feet on my Dashboard sippin' her drink
Pretty Brown Eyes, Pretty Brown Thighs
All Wise Intelligent Eyes
See you spread Butterfly, Pretty ass high
Slang Supreme Marble, I beat the Terrible Reign
Dirty South, Carolina Game, cockin' again
Hear the Guns bust, can be spittin' like this
High risk for MC's vocal anesthetic for your head Rush

[Hook: Masta Killa]
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling
Dare a motherfucker to swing
You know his Thing
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding

[Verse 3]
Now you see how the Crowd response when I get on
You'll neva last in this Square when I enter
Brooklyn - also known as Good Lookin'
Crooklyn - slidin' through your Central Bookin'
Knocked on the Friendly charge that got dropped
So I copped po' basin' wit the Five year pendin'
Can't count the Blessin'
Caught another case in the mix, Now I'm stressin'
Power to the People to Sequel, spark the people
See you at a Town near you, Comin' WU
