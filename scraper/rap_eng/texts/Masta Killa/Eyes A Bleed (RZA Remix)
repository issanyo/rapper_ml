[Intro: Bounty Killer]
Yeah yeah! YEA YEA YEAH!
Lawd a mercy
Well I and I a old herbalistic, and
This one is very enthusiastic because the world say dem want it, and
I-ses and praises to whosoever plant it, I gotta chant it
Well!

[Hook: Bounty Killer]
Smoke the weed so til me eye dem a bleed
And if I can't get the chronic, well the Killer a leave
Alaska and di skunk, I smoke dem deh by di trees
Hand me the weed because New York a freeze
Police smell mi weed and ah swarm me like bees
Dem nah get the stick, the dropped leaf or the seed
Well fi the weed, I have a personal greed
Alaska and the skunk, go get me dem please

[Bounty Killer]
I ask, who gonna be my sponsor?
Seh back this argument, say dem must legalize ganja
Believe a now me ask and never get any answer
Dem come wit cigarettes weh only give you lungs cancer, I heard
It give ya mouth bad odor
Some bwoy dem send fi needle and some snort the powder
Jamaica was brand as the land of ganja
A guy a look coke, send him go live a Colombia

[Hook]

[Masta Killa]
Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector
Wu-Tang sound control America
One operator, one selector

Those unaware would not knowledge the square
I linger in the air like smoke, but I'm there
Hard to di-tect yourself
When you can't see clear through the rapid feed, them collie weed?
Original ganja plant, dem bear seed, the aroma
Got me callin my connect, I need a donor
To lace me with pounds from Arizona, the elusive
Bounty and the Masta exclusive
Many entertainer want the chance to bust
But it's only with the Gods I trust, do I puff
Burnin bush from in front ho
Lampin on the Bay of Montego
To a far wind, bringin wallabee Clarks to the starvin
There's no escapin the soundclash
Gun fire shot, I make it hot at Sunsplash

[Hook]
