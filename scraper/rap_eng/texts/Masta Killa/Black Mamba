[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
BLACK MAMBA!

[Chorus: all]
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!

[RZA]
Yo unbreakable steel sword swingin', face the Black Mamba
Deadly Vipers, squeeze ya life out like anacondas
In the story, off wit ya head, the scene is gory
Single-edged steel blade designed by Hattori
Hanzo. You see the signature above the handle?
Try to strike out, you get ya arm dismantled
Chief of the Yakuza's wicked like Medusa
With Crazy 88's too, 'bout to meet ya maker

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty Bastard swordplay
Dirt McGirt be pickin' up skirts on 4th and Broadway
Japanese bitch be suckin' my dick
Puerto Rican hoes be lickin' my split
California Mountain Snake on the bed
Be givin' my head while I'm countin' my cake, crushin' up an 8th
Of that snow white shit, in the Pussy Wagon not hittin' the brakes!

[Chorus]

[Masta Killa]
Baaaaaamm.. hidden swordstyle hits, I wish
A nigga would test the Black Mamba, in a spit like the coma
Fill his Copperhead with the hollow tip lead
Yo.. who wanna dance with the fertile lands' deadly state?
Cottonmouth sticky from the Af' gooey
Blowin' smoke through the Viper Pit
Hold a listener tight, mic constrictor
Words from the theater, swift as Krishner

[Chorus]
