[Intro: Masta Killa]
Yeah
Funk Flex spin it back for me
DJ Clue, Desert Storm with me
Kay Slay stay stuntin' with me
My man Tony Touch come ride with me
Yeah, [?] rock this with me
And uh, Felli Fel from the whole wild West
Gettin' this money, that's how we be

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Yo, the High Chief Jamel Irief takes the stage
When I speak the hell I speak, lift the gauge
White chalk rappers
Slight talk, knife hawk, fight that rapper
Ruck the master, call me the fifth dan
Pop shit and chop bricks quick with his swift hand
Can't enter the venue, the fuck is your wristband?
Whole shit is stinkin' and sinkin' in quicksand
My worst verse better than the best
My best verse better than the rest
The rest of the rest need to rest
I suggest you all fall back 'for I mess up your chest
P!, I am the best
Brook Brothers in the casket, I'm fresh to death
I go knock on ya door like Jehovah Witness
Witness the gun spun son I'm wicked, uh
Gift of Gab, my gab is gifted
I say the right words, you be stabbed and lifted
All white knife, the Mercedes is black, kid
Gun popped, you get shot through babyback ribs
I'm the best at rap
Brownsville so you stepped that crack, motherfucker

[Chorus: Masta Killa]
Sean P is down with me
P.F. Cuttin' is down with me
Wu-Tang Clan is down with me
Gettin' this money, that's how we be
Brooklyn is down with me (Bed-Stuy)
East New York is down with me
Flatbush is down with me
Brownsville is down with me
Crown Heights is down with me
9th Wonder is down with me
Gettin' this money, that's how we be
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yo)

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
We keep it hip hop, socialize
Clean out your ears, open up your focal
Point me to the MC
Thinking he can pull his microphone out against me
Get your hands up, keep rising 'cause I can't stop, it ain't no top
See the flow is non-GMO, an orchard of witty unpredictable
Wise words growing organically
I spit cases of water refined, alkaline lines
Combined by design of rhyme, it's now food for
Multiples publishing and royalties is loyalty
And pays systematic on time
One time for your motherfucking mind
See the 22 points on my Universal Flag, designed
Combined with the relevance of intelligent, it's tolerant

[Outro: Masta Killa]
Yeah, yo
Yo peace to my whole universal hip-hop nation across the planet
You know what I mean? Peace to my people that rock, right?
From New York to Jersey, Boston to Philly
Connecticut to DC, (Staten Island) Baltimore to NE (New Hampshire)
[?], (Detroit) South Carolina gets down with me
Kansas, Atlanta gets down with me (Denver)
Miami. Jacksonville, Cashville, Louisiana, Seattle, New Orleans
Chi-Town down with me, H-Town
Getting this money that's how we be
LA is down with me
Dallas, Oakland, San Franc', Italy, uhu, Switzerland, [?]
London, German, Paris, getting this money that's how we be
Holland, light it up [?] day, Amsterdam y'all light it up [?] day
Getting this money that's how we be
African, Nigeria, the whole South America, you know
Cosmic Kev, Greg Street, Delaware
Sway & Tech, Kid Atmosphere
Down with me
