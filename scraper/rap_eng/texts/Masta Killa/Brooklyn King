[Masta Killa in Whispery Voice]
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
This is how I do my Thing
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing

[Hook]
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling
Dare a motherfucker to swing

[Verse 1]
Lose a arm, I'm calm stayin' heavily armed
Well protected, Heart, rib cage, the chest and solar plexus
Rugged Profile peep honey child checkin' my style
Quick wild as a fuck, slick witty talk, East New York
Hear the guns buck, backin 'em down
You know the sound, when the semi autos spit fully
Baron Bully, Timberland Boot, Black Hoody, Fitted Black Skully
You still on that bullshit? I can't get it out of me
Why should I switch the Prescription
The Whole World vibin' to what I'm Prescibin'
Keep the Jam livin'

[Masta Killa in Whispery Voice]
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing

[Hook: Masta Killa]
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling
Dare a motherfucker to swing
You know his Thing
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing

[Verse 2]
Uh, we ain't goin' home 'til the last blood's gone
Head strong enough to break Bone
Peace to the God Jah-Born
Tell Universe to love assent
Miss seen him on the Ave. with Lil' Ron gettin' bent
Yea it's another day in the Hood
I got my money from the block
Now I'm gon' to cop somethin' fly
To rock for the rest of the Week
Prefer the hard, not the drop slippin' of to the beat
Got the sweet smellin' sex in my Passenger seat
Pretty feet up on my dashboard sippin' her drink
Pretty Brown Eyes, Pretty Brown Thighs
All Wise Intelligent Eyes
See you spread Butterfly, Pretty ass high
Slang Supreme Marvel, Irief the Terrible reign
Dirty South, Carolina Game, cockin' an aim
Hear the Guns bust, canvas I'm spittin' like this
High risk for MC's vocal anesthetic for your head Rush

[Hook: Masta Killa]
Ya'll cats know how I do my Thing
Brooklyn King that'll snatch your Bling
Dare a motherfucker to swing
You know his Thing
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing

[Verse 3]
Now you see how the Crowd response when I get on
You can neva last in this Square when I enter
Brooklyn - also known as Good Lookin'
Crooklyn - slidin' through your Central Bookin'
Knocked on the felony charge that got dropped
So I copped the probation wit the five year pendin'
Can't count the Blessin'
Caught another case in the mix, Now I'm stressin'
Power to the People to Sequel, spark the people
See you at a Town near you, Comin' Wu
