[Intro: Kurupt]

Yeah, you know
The problem with most of these niggas nowadays
They ain't got no respect
See, life ain't just about all that other shit you lookin' at my nigga
You know, I love it on the Westside
That's why I pose with the homies, we smoke, drink, raise kids and make this motherfuckin' money
You hear me?

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]

My killa Cali gangsters a ride for me
Got brothers in the bay that'll die for me
Got the best weed smoke choke no seeds
Mexicans, crip, blood we all one seed
Shout the game, Snoop, Cypress Hill, B Real and real soldiers
Like Pac I still Feel
So I still ride dirty with the 5th steel
Got Kurupt young gotti with the semi shotty
My brother Power in the Maybach counting big money
The Cali sunshine but it ain't all sunny
Brothers dieing everyday and I pray for them
Falling soldiers in my heart where I still hold them
I feel I owe them
My brother coming home
On parole looking swoll
Young and old time to get gold so let's roll
These words that I write and recite is from the soul

[Verse 2: Kurupt]

Indo weed, extra green
Texture, extra, orange and green
Next to Inspectah Deck it seems
The reala Masta Killa and young gotti
I got to hit New York and push pass the kush hash
Big Snoop and Daz want to push past
Indo weed, and feeling fine
I'mma do this shit as well then again at nine
See, I'm cut from a different cloth
Got it? Got it?
I'm cut from a different cloth
Bodyguard hard, you niggas are soft
See you niggas ain't loyal
You don't know how stay down and play your position
Get a new fitting
Fitting the function, you's an undercover clown
I was born to push a concrete line
I change lives, I enhance my eyes
I'm Magneto, Magneto, aniyo
The one that can pose the metal at all times
If you look, you find
Close eyes to blind
Look
