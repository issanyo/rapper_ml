[Verse 1: Boy Backs]
Eh-yo, I'm fresh off the airplane, running through the airport
Six hours jet lag now I'm smoking Newports
Rent a car Trans Am, now I'm on transport
I can drive reckless, insurance full tort
Rap is my hobby, racing is my new sport
Backs on the mission, y'all better abort
I never cop pleas I just take it to court
Catch me in the projects still drinking a quart
Sitting on crates, my cocaine is great
My weed even better we never smoking that [?gredda?]
Pure garbage, Backwoods and baggage
With Tommy Green I'm still spending that cabbage
Pull a pistol, still letting 'em have it
32 sub you can call me Magic
David Blaine I'm back simple and plain
Prisoner of war, I'm rap's John McCain

[Chorus: MoeRoc]
My OGs told me, said my OG told 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
Said the OGs told me that real
My OG told me 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
I said the OGs told me that real

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Peace yelling drum the kick, Killa [?Murdy?] Clique
Billion dollar motion picture, figure niggas
Thousand dollar baller, riches kill snake and snitches
Diamond pinky ringing for the bitches
Listen to the greatest rap murderer, East Medina warrior
Snow-colored Benz in the winter, Wu forever
Don't you ever think we ain't forever, still tougher than leather
Still taking money, monumental words
For the mental still lethal, spit fly shit seasonal
Major League, universal song rang regional
But still in these concrete streets where life is so real
I still set sail for my peoples 'cause I see you

[Chorus: MoeRoc]
My OGs told me, said my OG told 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
Said the OGs told me that real
My OG told me 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
I said the OGs told me that real

[Verse 3: Boy Backs]
Double Benzes, we ride bumper to bumper
Rims on every wheel, you rolling with hoodville
We so ill, y'all cats is no thrill
Anybody in the way get turned to road kill
Die slow, my team is on go
We 55 deep and wearing that logo
I'm a lion born a Leo
And you know I got soul but never a Ne-Yo
Y'all rappers is broke like T.O
Better off running up in the bank like Cleo
Set it off, I'm quick to let it off
High grade weed and a bottle of Smirnoff

[Chorus: MoeRoc]
My OGs told me, said my OG told 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
Said the OGs told me that real
My OG told me 'bout money
My OG told me 'bout life
My OG told me, said the OG told me
I said the OGs told me that real

[Outro: Masta Killa]
Wu-Tang forever, nigga
Wu-Tang forever, nigga
Wu-Tang forever, nigga
