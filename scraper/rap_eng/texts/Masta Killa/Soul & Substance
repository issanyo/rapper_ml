[Hook] (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?

[Verse 1]
I stimulate life and matter in my circumference
None could ever match my palm, I'm calm
So you know when I blow the bomb
It's gonna quake something like a migraine pain
It's gonna ache something stopping all motion
You could never move against the energy intensity
Knowledge my reality
Everything flow mathematically in order
My universal gravity pull is magnetic
Peace Allah victorious, Shabar B. Glorious
Mentally the mind see every speck of dust
And every cubic square inch
The God magnificent build and make the rhyme still back to the paper

[Hook] (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?

[Verse 2]
That's word from my Soul
I came to bring gold from the trader, he stole
And left you with a promise that was never fulfilled
I build and make the Earth quake
Catch a thought before it escape and write it down
I'm all so blessed, these words I manifest
My universal flag on my chest, Sun, Moon, Crest
Govern by the God of course, cause I'm a star black to the core
The mic so hot, it a blow the Fahrenheit
It's only one day, but I love it at night
Yo, let me build with you for a second

[Hook] (x2)
My guitar string sing
Make me wanna like, spit that thin, thing
When I'm on the mic talking to you, how you like?
