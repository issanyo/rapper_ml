[Intro]
Peace; this is the motherfucking high chief Jamel Arief
I represent the Wu-Tang Clan kid
Tony Touch, 50 MC's
Wu-Killa Bee collaboration
For the nation...

[Verse 1]
Intriguing to the ear, but bitter to the heart
As I begin to take part in the art of dart throwing
Starring the Wu-Tang swordsman
Day two breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in revines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathe through underwater wreaths
The enemy walks above, I remain subterranean in mud
Off-shore banks tanks approach the location
Bombed by the circle of death formation
Communication lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
And large in helmets of shrapnel, fragments of shell
Inhale these highly venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hands of the chief's command volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
The fences are down, knowledge material lies through the sound
Revealing the skill that causes the ground to tilt, feel the tension
Blistering quills are scorching
You could never stomach the eruption of god dimension
Science is the study of all things
Knowledge my sword swing, guns go off in the east wing
It's a blessin' to deliver this lesson
Who's resting? You've been summonsed to awaken
A nation of sleeping giants who are clients to the devil's civilization
Migration expands my plan to the maximum capacity
Killarmy, nothing can hold we
From launchin' out over the earth and disperse
In the triple darkness niggas return unscathed
At ease and as you were
But the thought of be able to breathe
And leave these worldly possessions
Have emcees fret to step in my direction
