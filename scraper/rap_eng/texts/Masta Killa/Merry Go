[Hook: HaLo]
On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town
On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town
You deserve a crown, best in the town
Queen of the sound, best in the town
You deserve a noun, best in the town
Queen of the sound, Mary hold it down
You deserve a crown, queen of the sound
Mary hold it down, on my merry way
On my merry way from her merry go round
Mary hold it down, best in the town

[Verse 1: HaLo]
My people like “word up”, my people like “word up”
Shorties with they skirt up we kill it and shoot the hearse up
Brothers like “act right”, brothers like “act right”
Hit ‘em with that mag life flash light for the act right
Live from the session, had to make ‘em guess huh?
This is not a lecture, live from the sector
Jam’ with the passion the heart reflect the fashion
We could get our bash on, brass knuckles to bash on
Here and there we takin’ it everywhere
The room with heavy stares, your petty cares
Now and then, here and there we takin’ it everywhere
The room with heavy stares we piss on your petty cares

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Put thought together like punches, build quotes, combine notes
Every sentence properly cemented
Asia like black spliffed it
Young gifted with the gab as my brothers say
Feng shui I lived the realm another day, it’s still real
I await the thought it takes shape far from the mind
Then design a rhyme that I bore into existence
Simplistic, nothin’ complicated
No set dated, long I waited, supreme clientele
Pizza chit bang 4-5-6 and the dice
You know my rhymes slice my mic cock his head shot
My whiz hold a pretty Glock heads bob, beats knock
Son, this is show shot, blow until your speakers pop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Charlie Smarts]
Ok, turnin’ on the stereo, murder at the Marigold
Shootin’ at the stars, burnin’ at the burial
21 gun salute, punks uncomfortable
What? What? Fuck the booth, rappin’ in the casket
An underground nigga, shit, Shaq made a classic
Nigga love the sound when the killin’s by a masta
Me and my niggas livin’ already
Supposed to be dead or in prison already
Can’t see me like sous storm
We do it up until anomalies is the new norm, learn somethin’
Slap a kid with a book light, turn somethin’
E’ryday and send him on his merry way

[Hook]
