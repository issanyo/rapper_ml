[Intro]

{​​​​​Sample: Money, money (4x) }​​​​​

[Verse 1: M-Eighty]
Let's take it back to the blacktop
Mags on le Donna
When the boom box hittin' bong
I play your position
Know the ledge got some juice now
40 ounce get loose now
Holler at some crazies
That believes the other crew's sound stealing
Gold chillin heads up to the ceilin'
Constantly revealin' hip hop Will ya stealin'
Through the veins and the buzz stream the goat scream
Enough cream gunnin' [ ]
For a million, keep 'em comin
Back for more, reservoir dog raw
With the raw bagged up under the floorboards
Pure uncut dope, unmarked bills
Bad gold cables and the [ ] grills
Drop top Mercedes with the shiny chrome rims
See hip hop was even bling bling back then
Don't think for one point materialism's new
Just because you ain't acknowledge the old school
True I'm livin' understand every [ ]  a livin'
Gave birth to a wizard, [ ]
On a mission goin day by day
While we hood I'm God playin' , play by play

Now pray

[Hook]

{​​​​​Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}​​​​​


[Hook]

{​​​​​Pull out your money
Pull out your cut
Money, bitches, cars, clothes and weed
(Money, money)
Even if I fail I land on a bunch of money}​​​​​

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Guns and drugs and thugs hold it down in the slums
Smuggling crumbs, dope fiend bodies is numb
We might beat you it's stolen, we don't know where you're from
Got goons all around yeah, like over a 100
Sober and blunted, running now, soldiers is cunning
Moody was stubborn, even pull a tool on each other
Lay your house flat, leave with your cheese from your mousetrap
Then ride out back to the hideout where we count stacks
Papered up, fresh out the barber shop, tapered up
Hoes used to front on 'em but now they all vapoured up
Cake is us, this is good cush, take a puff
Must I remind you need a grinder just to break it up
Back to the murder plot, heard he got robbed
And flossers lied same night you heard he got got
A boss he was not, cross me and it's off with your top
Rock you with cops and trespassing and locking your blocks

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3:  Masta Killa]
My world winning lifestyle, never smile much
Nothing personal it's how we grew up
Ghetto life, city lights, corner hustlers who trying to escape it
Street violence where the weak won't make it
Recognizing life is real and currency is needed
But it gets taken if you can't defend it
Early manhood fast lane, slinging cocaine to make your ends meet
Mother weak younger song laying in the streets
Beat the murder charge acquitted
Bounce to the next state where they're rockin, bank stoppin everything
Heard him singing, contract on his head
Like Tommy Wink for real

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4:   Cappadonna]
Whether I'm rich or poor, I'ma still want more
I've been tryna maintain but I'm still hardcore
I be in the streets all day, 4 in the morning
See these all the time, I'm ignoring the warning
I'm a hustle hard nigga, you can hear my holler
Used to be into madness, yeah I came from under
I'm a project zero nights and all that fly shit
Plus I get it free, I ain't always gotta buy it
Fuck y'all niggas ya don't even gotta try it
I'm Mountain  AC, I feel like I'm retired
I'm a family man now and now I'm the wisest
I don't play no games, I keep my eye on the misers
Little children take notice, little niggas take note
Real niggas get paid but never end up in state clothes

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5:  Canibus]
There are no words to describe what I see with my eyes
They brains are fried, they just be believing the lies
They locked up inside the law, always talkin' bout they hardcore
Nigga you ain't even inside cyber secure
Til I bust down your door with a 44 inch chainsaw
Force your jaw, pitch like a claymore
I don't give a fat rat's ass about the price of that gas
I'm already strapped for cash
Lake Placid swamp gator habitat
Canibus Brad Pitt World War Z bugout bag kiss
Capricorn Asian pass
M-Eighty in the Situation Room talking to the top brass
50 magnification
100 millimeters looking at the space stations workin' out the equations
Sinkhole black hole bubblin' Cajun, tough as the raven
My jumbo gumbo gumbo taste it
Nothing can save him, face it, you suckers wasted
Soldiers sold, now you havin' trouble with the payments
La lay loo lay lo with Lupe's laces
Ain't no little geegaws uncreate my creations
That's why I keep pace with energies beyond my displacement
Hoping to give faith to the faithless
20 gold shillings with the illest of the Almighty siblings
In the village organizing the pillage, niggas
