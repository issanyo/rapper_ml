[Verse 1: Masta Killa]  (x2)
Intruder alert, sound the cymbal
This be the war of the Shaolin Temple
It's time to re-stack my gun
We the ones that'll come through and smack sparks out your art
With the exception of a few that respected it for what it was
Sick venomous syndrome - studied many styles
But this tactic I've adapted and made it my own
Feeling rightness at it at home
Splitting your head with the chrome
He's one who sees he's a threat
He couldn't have made it through
All the vaccines and quarantines
We hit him with explosive gases
So he couldn't teach the masses, but still
Who came in the name of Wu-Tang to nourish the brain?
