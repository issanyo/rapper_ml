[Intro: Daveed Diggs]
SB, what up
Hellfyre club, what up
It's Clipping, bitch
Tell them something they don't know

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
The thing about murder is it's a mess
The thing about hiring killers is payment is stressful
The thing about living long is regret
But shit, sometimes you just got to pull the fucking trigger
Prophetic profiteering pop a pill in a park
And wheeling around on a Segway calling it a metaphor
You on that next shit
What you get shit
A synthetic sense of being
Stop on a hill in the dark and dealing
What sounded like deadweight
Calling up Jennifer she on that X shit, no sex shit
She sells Cialis by the seaside out the sixth floor balcony apartment
He bows when he enters a touch of class 'fore he touch that ass
And she never suspected the geriatric motherfucker would pull something fast
It was the last move he ever made so
Needless to say she was on some not today shit and
Even it came when you met up with her for the date like
Damn, if you had any game at all it could have been a hell of a weekend
But instead you got stabbed in the fucking chest

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Cause you ain't know who the fuck you were dealing with
Talking about your dough like it's bakers in the building, bitch
You couldn't even blow if the dick was in between your lips
Cock back, cop that, drop stacks, run motherfucker
The baller's in the building
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Give a fuck about your feelings
Unless you
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know

[Verse 2: SB the Moor]
Yo, the old nigga's dead
New nigga step up, never gave a fuck
Living in his head
Bitch texts some cops sharing Milky Puffs
But he more about his bread, uh
So when he had heard the nigga had knitted up red
Carte blanche motherfucker
He had a couple of bumps and his nerves was lead
Headed to the HNIC's eyes
Ice tea, he driving on the 101, tired of asking nicely
She said "Get your ass some paper, life's pricey
And if you want this pussy, get with it, fit it with ice
Icy is always better, that's the way that I see it"
Damn, she right though
And this shit is flight or fight, bro
But the flight ain't getting you nothing
So you better stick to the night, yo
Get your ass some nighttime vision
And no no one hears your plight, so
You best turn lead to steel
Better go and get your ass right, go
Walk through the door, doorman laughs (hahaha) but he don't say nothing
He probably thinking he bluffing
Soft nigga who stuffed with stuffing but he God damn serious, ughhh
Nigga probably thinks he's delirious, ughhh
But the bomb strapped to his chest gonna explain how damn clear he is

[Hook]
Cause you ain't know who the fuck you were dealing with
Talking about your dough like it's bakers in the building, bitch
You couldn't even blow if the dick was in between your lips
Cock back, cop that, drop stacks, run motherfucker
The baller's in the building
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Give a fuck about your feelings
Unless you
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know

[Break 1: Spoken]
Is that the kind of work you want?
Aren't you going to try and stop them?
You can't stop the Hellfyre Club

[Verse 3: Nocando]
I feel like a young Heihachi Mishima
My bloodline is the product of demons
Fucking with this young Hollywood model
She don't so drugs so she probably bulimic, alright
I'm sliding through the city intravenous
Smelling like a struggle and feeling like completion
I'm too seasoned, don't rhyme without a reason
Give me 300 million Rupiah, yea I'm feeling Indonesian, right
Look into my iris you might glimpse my soul
My best friend just got off a high risk parole
We've been through ups and downs in life's give's and go's
Don't fuck with us tonight cause we so happy we could fight

[Hook]
Cause you ain't know who the fuck you were dealing with
Talking about your dough like it's bakers in the building, bitch
You couldn't even blow if the dick was in between your lips
Cock back, cop that, drop stacks, run motherfucker
The baller's in the building
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Give a fuck about your feelings
Unless you
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know

[Bridge 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Hell, remember when we was young and we used to go "ahhhhhhhh"?
(Get your bottoms off)
(I'm the negative type)

[Verse 4: Open Mike Eagle]
We all assorted bones thrown in a sack of flesh
I wonder what that actress gets for being on The Bachelorette
I don't know what's on all my broken rap cassettes
But I won't trash them yet
And I don't know why
I'm in a crew with all solo guys
We got our own secret language
Plus our logo's fly
I really think so
Like I was turning Japanese
I also think you can make poison from churning appleseeds
So don't drink with me
I ate a Gummy Bear recently that put me on every possible frequency
I bet you didn't know that shit
Mission accomplished
This is a pompous missive--admittedly, it's dishonest

[Verse 5: Daveed Diggs]
If the skeletons in your closet are having a quincea√±era
Then it's probably time to open the fuck up
Full disclosure: there's foolies tucked in every crevice you ain't searched
And your mind is a prime candidate to merk if you would let it
So better run trick (run trick)
Cause the game ain't a game no more it's a fucking gun trick (gun trick)
Click, click, hear that in a dream
With the team that mean on the tongue quick
Tick, tick, it's a bomb in the basement
Basically stay in the sun, bitch
Cause the vitamin D isn't necessary
Bitter bite on the mind,  a reminder of times
You done  bit off more than you can chew
Should have known this was about monsters
They wait in the closet for you
And you wait in the dark for enlightenment
Frozen in a warrior two
How's your chakra, bro?
When you cock the four and peel back your skull like platanos

Pop pop
And it goes, and it goes, and it goes (and it goes, and it goes)
And again
Pop pop
Get low, get low, get low (get low, get low)
Gonna pick out a halo, shit
Chop chop
Did you know, did you know, did you know (did you know?)
To be static does he make the automatic go (RAWK)
And the body go drop
And the party don't stop
Liquor shot, give a motherfucker props

[Hook]
Cause you ain't know who the fuck you were dealing with
Talking about your dough like it's bakers in the building, bitch
You couldn't even blow if the dick was in between your lips
Cock back, cop that, drop stacks, run motherfucker
The baller's in the building
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Give a fuck about your feelings
Unless you
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
Tell them something they don't know
