[Verse 1]
Fuck time, young forever
Get money, get money, don't get better
Get dead, get martyred, get stupid
Get high, get low, get useless
Get up, get beat down
Get a deal, get a camp, get around
Get a main bitch and a mistress
Get a tattoo, get a face lifted
Get a whip, get two
Get three, fuck actin' brand new
Get money, get money, don't get better
Fuck time, young forever

[Hook: Ezra Buchla]
Real

[Verse 2]
Fuck fame, keep it one hundred
Get money, get money, then stay blunted
Get a stash house, get a trousse
Get a runner, get some knocks, get a new connect
Get a Jesus piece, get some church shoes
Get a good taper, get a good dude
Get your mom a crib and your man's and 'em
Get a lot of kids, give a grands to them
Get an empire, get a driver
Tinted windows, get new attire
Get a name, get it out
Get the game, get the clout
Get money, get money, and stay blunted
Fuck fame, keep it one hundred

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck running, stay strapped up
Get money, get money, get backup
Get stupid, get paid, get killers, get laid
Get yours, get faded, get realer
Get a plan, get a hustle, get locked
Get out, get high, hit the block
Get money, get money, get backup
Fuck running, stay strapped up

[Hook]

[Outro]
Fuck time, young forever
Get money, get money, don't get better
Get money, get money, and stay blunted
Fuck fame, keep it one hundred
Fuck fame, keep it one hundred
Get money, get money, and stay blunted
Get money, get money, get backup
Fuck running, stay strapped up
