[Verse 1]
Cumulus clouds sitting up high
Shape-shifting aimless and slow
The breeze is easy it moves by
Timid more whisper than blow
Telephone wires they buzz live
Blackbird is frozen in flight
Low-hanging Sun makes a orange sky
Silhouettes in a back-light
Black shingled roofs are all bright trimmed
The trim the same on the windows
8 year old girl color caramel skin
Pink barrettes and color pencils
Stares, her mouth open and eyes wide
As the crowd gathers below
They heard the shouts and they knew why
Grab cellphones pressing record
Blue uniform and a badge on
Showing no fear in his eyes
Stands in the street with his gun drawn
Military issue .45

[Hook]
Times have made a choice of what to keep and what to throw away
Everything ingrained comes to a point so sharp could cut a piece a day
And it bleeds on the ground, keep your knees on the ground where they belong
Keep your knees on the ground where they belong

[Verse 2]
Brown boy sitting on his knees with his eyes shut
Hands behind his head fingers woven pinkies up
Saying he ain't even doin' nothing what you want
They threw him on the ground when he called them all punks
Retro blue and white Jordans tongues out
Over the black jeans cuffed just the right amount
To make them bunch by the calves how he like
Just ran out of boxer briefs so he wearing tighty-whities
With a white t-shirt and the breeze catch it just so
Pressing it tight against his chest so the red hole
Is getting wider and the blood is soaking in the fabric
And pooling on the ground he looks down automatic
And the dark pavement gets darker when it's wet
He's losing balance slow with his hands on his head
So his face hits first and his eyes go dead
And the air is sucked out of the world with his last breath

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One side is sneakers and wedge heels
One side is boots with a steel toe
One wants to shout the way they feel
One told "feel nothing and move slow"
A line in riot gear waving glass
Full head to toe body armor
A line of paper signs waving flags
Crying for dead sons and daughters
The training said "Here's the enemy
Prepare yourself for the war
When they get violent you'd better be
Ready to defend the corps"
In come the tanks and the AK's
Protestors running for life
8 Year old girl crying loud at the window
Not a single cloud within sight

[Hook]

Go ahead and make your peace baby go on and get your piece
They swore to keep the peace and it is shattered into pieces
And it bleeds on the ground, keep your knees on the ground where they belong
Keep your knees on the ground where they belong
