[Verse 1]
The chance that he ever reaches any place
Suitable to support life in his lifetime's pretty low
(Get low) Pretty low, (Get low)
Pretty low (Get low) pretty low (Get low)
And the chances of him of ever seeing anybody that he knows
Are even lower so he's making up his mind to just go
(Let go) Just go, (Let go) just go, (Let go) just go (Let go)
So it's one shot in the arm (One shot in the arm)
Hazy in the head (Hazy in the head)
Set the timer once (Set the timer once)
Lay down in the bed (Lay down and)
Close the hatch trying to clear your mind
Cause nightmares and alarms blowing kill the time
If you have a God say something sublime
Deep breath and leave it behind you ready to
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) Be right here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up
(Jump) There'll be no here when you wake up

Slow blood
Slow blood
Slow blood

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in sleep is a brainstorm and the EKG spikes
And the nerves fire like flies lightly then die slightly each night
Alright alright alright
It's an artifact apparently, similar to a muscle memory
And he grabs her ropes and chokes back songs
Like tears, like stars, like gears, and moving pictures
Picture perfect, paint a perfect picture
Perforate it, rip it up into a thousand jagged edges
He's embarrassed of the love he has for things you never knew
Didn't you know? Happiness is waiting at your door
In a sleek black dress and a kiss that says "hello"
And a thick black mess and a mom that says "don't go"
And a cul-de-sac so cold it'll hold you close
When the stores all close and the clothes so thin to begin with
When the wind rips they blow

[Bridge]
Pretty low, (Get low) pretty low, (Get low)
Pretty low, (Get low) pretty low (Get low)
Just go, (Let go) just go, (Let go)
Just go, (Let go) just go (Let go)

[Hook (Paul Outlaw)]
Slow blood (I follow the stars when the sun goes to bed)
Slow blood (Everything I've ever known is long dead)
Slow blood (I can't go back home cause I wanna be free)
Slow blood (Someone tell the others what's become of me)
