[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
As the speakers clip
Turn that bitch up
I'm just trying to spit my raps
And get my dick sucked
We done came to L.A
Trying to get bucks
So I could spend them on
Something to put in this cup
Fill me up, gas tank on E
And so is she
And so may we
Menage a three
Or is it really six of ya?
I've been compensating for
Double vision and listen, ahhh-
Which way to the front door?
I've been here for way too long
I got here at four
And it's four now
Or do I mean eight?
Fuck it, there go my partners
We finna levitate

[Hook]
Trees like a motherfucker
Drank like a motherfucker
Which motherfucker wanna
Try and break a motherfucker?
Wow, like who the motherfucker now?
I'm so turnt up can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Nope, can't turn me down
I'm so turnt up, please turn me down

[Post-Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
I need my shit loud
I need my shit loud
I need my shit

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
We looking for the downest bitch
The bottom as we call her
The follower like a doctor
Prescribe it
Hands off, man avert your eyelids
Or get the full magazine
If you feeling like subscribing
Powder like a motherfucking snowstorm
Bitch say she wanna keep her throat warm
I told her better drop it low as it go
This sterno is no norm
Well drink and I need to see something, baby
How to go get it is nothing, baby
We're nothing
Where'd you go? Where'd I go?
Shit, I can't feel my legs
I need another one, pass me the-

[Hook]
Trees like a motherfucker
Drank like a motherfucker
Which motherfucker wanna
Try and break a motherfucker?
Wow, like who the motherfucker now?
I'm so turnt up can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Nope, can't turn me down
I'm so turnt up, please turn me down

[Post-Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
I need my shit loud
I need my shit loud
I need my shit

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Okay for real, though
The light's out but I still glow
I can't see but I still go
I'm chill but I could kill, though
It's nil though, it's nado
These chicks say they're from Oslo
Brought white girl by the Costco
I said I like mines raw, though
They ripped up their rubbers
I said bitch you must be trippin'
I'm dippin' dottin' Is and crossin' Ts
And it ain't trickin' if I want it
I wanna marry, fuck there I go again
The dopest motherfucker ever tumbled out fallopians

[Hook]
Trees like a motherfucker
Drank like a motherfucker
Which motherfucker wanna
Try and break a motherfucker?
Wow, like who the motherfucker now?
I'm so turnt up can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Uh, can't turn me down
Nope, can't turn me down
I'm so turnt up, please turn me down

[Outro: Daveed Diggs]
I need my shit loud
I need my shit loud
I need my shit
