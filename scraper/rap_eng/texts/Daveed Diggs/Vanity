[Chorus: Deep, unidentifiable voice]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Moving me like the academy
Groupie on me like a fantasy

Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Painting the town like a canopy
They mad at me
Mad at me
Mad at me

[Verse 1: Utkarsh Ambudkar]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Feel the humanity, ah
Pain is the canopy, ah
Blood is the canvas
Egos that brush that I paint with
Feel the sound of the bass hit
While I drown in the fake shit

Oooh Weee

Sweet smell of the validation
Meet me down in hell with the ovation
Who am I?
Just a man with an obligation to sell every bit of insecurity for the compensation

Ayo that image is my alter
It’s my concentration
Those filters never falter
Join the congregation
Yeah this bodies what I offer
Yeah I’m ready for slaughter
Make me what you wanna
Come and lead me to water

Give you all that I have for the bag
Make it so heavy it drags
Make it so heavy that it breaks my back
Make it so heavy that it breaks my fucking back

Yeah, this is my life
And I’m a ruin it
But they gon say that I looked fucking mighty fine doin’ it

[Chorus: Deep, unidentifiable voice]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Movie me like the academy
Groupie on me like a fantasy

Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Painting the town like a canopy
They mad at me
Mad at me
Mad at me

[Verse 2: Rafael Casal]
Yeah
Look at me
Look at me

Oh man I’m cheffin' I must have a cook in me
Was complicated now accommodated
I guess I’m inpatient that’s the crook in me
I catch a feeling a week
Drop all the pills in the sink
I spin my wheels on the brink
Skid off and think they get someone else in the mink and it’s gone in a blink

Vanity
Vanity

Somebody gotta be shining
When it’s you, you feel like a giant
Take it away and I’m violent
I feel like I’m faded to silent

Apathy
Apathy

My mind is a divided calamity
Fuck what you askin' me
Where is my addy
My gun is untucked and I’m hunting for casualties

That’s what happens when you come from hood shit
You wonder who got the audacity
Fuck with my family try to unravel me
Hand me the gavel I’m judging them so fucking happily

Ugh

And who could say I’m eating so pardon my souffle yeah
I’ve combed down like tupé when I read up like I’m Pusé
Get it poppin' like I’m on a crusade
Mobbin’ like it’s Friday on a Tuesday

Some choose between what you should do and you could do but I always choose to do it the two ways

Yeah

[Chorus: Deep, unidentifiable voice]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Movie me like the academy
Groupie on me like a fantasy

Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Painting the town like a canopy
They mad at me
Mad at me
Mad at me

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Uh
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

God only knows what is living done took from me
Moments of modesty stolen the crook in me up on the stage got ‘em cookin' and jukin' and Millie rockin'
Fill me pockets with pennies
The panties dropping pussy popping
Got plenty of pretty options I process no Pentium

Here I’m a mac, get it crackin' for anyone who ever doubted I
Hop on this bandwagon and take a ride
I’m a pied piper these kids hyphy
They likes on my twitter be feeding my
Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Let me talk candidly been buying jackets like kids buying candy
My sanity gone but God damn it I’m fly and the man in the mirror clearer than he ever been

Loving the shine in my skin
Loving the sheen on the jewels
Loving the weight of the watch
Loving the way that the fools
Who used to be reaching for tools now holler for high fives
Then talk beef like five guys
Then see they girl with eyes wide fantasizing I’m spreading her thighs wide and why not?

I feel death in my blindspot
Just like every brown body outlined on the sidewalk
So while mine walk
I'ma drape it in the best
So everyone look at the armor and ignore the hole in my chest (uh)

[Chorus: Deep, unidentifiable voice]
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Movie me like the academy
Groupie on me like a fantasy

Look at me
Look at me
Look at me

Vanity
Vanity
Vanity

Painting the town like a canopy
They mad at me
Mad at me
Mad at me

[Repeat of Chorus: Deep, unidentifiable voice layered with Rafael Casal's?]
Look at me

Movie me like the academy
Groupie on me like a fantasy
