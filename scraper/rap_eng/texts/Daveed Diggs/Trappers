[Introduction]
Yeah, okay
Get back
You already know what it is. Woo!
Chukwudi Hodge
They even know you make beats, breh? (Word becomes flesh)
Khalil Anthony Peebles (Haha, yeah!)
Let's get it

You know, there’s a lot of shit talk
Going on in the rat cave right now (you know?)
Personally, I’ve got other things on my mind, man (say that shit)

[Verse 1]
Now talk shit if you want, for real I'm only rapping
I stay out of traps, why everybody trapping?
And maybe I'm just hating, because I'm on these beats
But there's more drug dealers on MTV than in the streets
And that don't make no sense, you ask me how I feel
I think we all be tripping too hard on keeping it real
Personally I like my music to take me away
I get reality outside my window every day
And every day is deadly, it's war just getting dressed
And every morning worthy of the Gettysburg address
My address in the east, my coast is in the west
That coat of arms is heavy, so some prefer the vest
Maybe I rock it too, that look is kinda hot
Although I think a better strategy is don't get shot
My nigga, don't get locked up over dumb shit
Ass all up in Rita because you have some little funk shit
Some day my tongue spits, it's just a dumb show
I ain't no puppet, I do go dumb though
Dumb as a nigga smart, smart as a nigga grown
And grown enough to know nobody cares about these poems
The poems are instrumental, the instrumentals knock
So whether or not you understand it, everybody rock
Go ahead and clock in, I got it locked up
Now talk shit if you want, but I don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about what they say to me
Oh these motherfuckers playing games as far as I can see
They do what they do but they cannot tell me what I gotta be
They put trappers on TV (Woo)
They put trappers on TV

[Verse 2]
Now talk shit if you want, for real I'm only rapping
This will not change the world, when this drops nothing happens
This music's only pop, I hope you're entertained
Don't care what you believe, don't care what set you claim
Long as you claim it loud, when you come to my shows
So it's irrelevant, we're artists, this is how it goes
I tell you when to go, you tell me that it slaps
I'm right back in the laboratory cooking like it's crack
And I'm an addict too like any rock head
Plumbing the bedrock, sleeping on rock beds
We built this city on it, progressives pity on it
Conservatives can't serve it up and so they shit upon it
The war on drugs, the war on terror, war for any season
A war inside and yet you ask when we war, what’s the reason?
Why y'alI be battle rappin'? Why do y'all carry guns?
We learned this shit from you, you think it's just for fun?
Well shit, you right it is and tinged with innuendo
Satire tongue-in-cheek and coon it up to the crescendo
This game like a Nintendo, sometimes it's just for Wii
But still we put it in the air for everyone to see
See me and now you don't, here today gone tomorrow
I want my money, shit, wherever it goes I follow
I know it's hard to swallow you thought you knew the kid
But it's coincidental that I share a name with Diggs
Go ahead and get it started, but I'm not the catalyst
I am a fictional character, I do not exist
I know you looking at me for truth, but shit you outta luck
Now talk shit if you want, but I don't give a fuck
Realest shit I ever wrote

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about what they say to me
Oh these motherfuckers playing games as far as I can see
They do what they do but they cannot tell me what I gotta be
They put trappers on TV (Woo)
They put trappers on TV
