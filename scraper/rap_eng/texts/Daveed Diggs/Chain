[Verse 1]
Got a year’s paycheck hangin’ on his neck
Gotta floss for the bitches
Got a wallet full of money and a new Rolex
And the low-hittin' switches
Gotta put on for the block he got brought up
And all the blocks just like it
Gotta find more traps in every city that he visit
Show 'em how to get right shit
Got a neck tattoo and a hat with a leather brim
Teardrops on the face
Got a Chevalier and a vintage Jay's
And a Louis briefcase
Got the Comme des Garçons cologne to drop on
Neck smellin’ like gold
Got the taper fresh and the Tom Ford pressed
The A/C on cold
Got a text of the light from a number that he didn’t know
Gotta pull out the celly
Got a message sayin’ he was dead if he tried to go
Gotta look like: "Really?"
Gotta feel like: "What the fuck is this shit 'bout?"
These hoods so triflin’
Gotta show 'em how to step they life up a little bit
All they think about is fightin’
Gotta laugh at it, really, ain't nobody gonna do shit
All these wannabe thugs
Got so much cash, 'course they gonna wanna hate
These kids need hugs
Got an itch when he put the gas pedal to the floor
Somethin' didn't feel right
Got a bullet through his brain, and he didn't feel anything more

[Hook]
Don't act surprised
When a real motherfucker come around and take yo' shit
These streets got eyes on every corner, they watchin' you
When you flash yo' jewels (Tuck yo' chain!)
Don't act surprised
When a real motherfucker come around and take your shit (Tuck yo' chain!)
These streets got eyes on every corner, they watchin' you
Watchin' you

[Verse 2]
Got a half a key and a squad of goons
Got killers on payroll
Got ecstasy, got good kush, too
Got a plug in [?]
Got a small spot in the same hood where he hustle
Everybody know Cooper
Gotta respect the man who take care of the family
No trouble on the stoop, where he got
Rottweilers that bark wild
At night when you might step close
Got deadbolts, got lead posts on the beds
Keep a Beretta close to his headboard
At night when he is sleepin’
Don’t you even think about creepin’ on him
He squeezin' 'fore when he reason
Mouth still 'cheese'-in'
‘Cause he got a death wish, since he was a kid
No reason to stay here
Got money, look what that shit did
Got a whole block in fear
Got hoes lot got clear
Got dro, got sincere
Got wifey right, got in a fight
Got a little tight, got too hype
Gotta get out, gotta get air
Got a standin' tab at a local bar
‘Cause they know he good for it
Gonna wish he’d seen the approaching car
Creepin' on some slow shit
Got his chain on still, 'cause he walked out fast
And forgot to tuck it
Got to the door, when two shots blast

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Got a man at home, ain’t doin' shit so she stroll
Got babies too and she ain’t givin’ em up
So bankroll is a must, gotta muster up
Gotta knuckle up sometimes, gotta get them bucks
Buck back when the bullshit get too rough
Gotta keep a motherfucker up
Gotta ride rough, bumpin’ that E.D.E
All these lil' bitches prolly [?]
Gotta look out for the P.I.M
PB&J for little Tyrese
Got a money tree stashed in the mattress
Gotta be the world’s best actress
Gotta flash tits, flash dance
Gymnastics, jazz tap tap tap
Switchblade in the bra strap
Gotta stay strapped, gotta stay fly
Gotta stay around this motherfucker who stay high
God knows why
Gotta have a baby daddy somewhere
Gotta go out and decompress
Gotta go out or be depressed
Gotta be the best, gotta be stressed
Got a fat gold ring, class of 2003
Got a long, gold chain, danglin’ to the belly
Got a button open on the top
Two from the bottom
Got outside the club, flossin’ click-clack
