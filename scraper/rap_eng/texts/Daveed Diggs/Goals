[Hook: Rafael Casal]
I just wanna live a little bit of my goals
I been at this for a minute now
Who are you to come and tear us down?
I put on for my town, my town
(My town, my town)

[Verse 1: Rafael Casal]
Uh livin' on the floor on the mattress
Carpets got burns from the ashes
Smoke loud and I'm proud of the practice
My girl go like the furly ghost
Gig hard and she swerve the most
Gold fronts while she stunt on you hoes
Bay girl bay girl they caught the smokes
Bay girl slay girl they got the votes
Keep my mind so simple
Only buy, no rentals
Keep my money quiet, no info
I ain't a crip but my currency crypto
I got my mind on the motion in here
This flow's not mainstream cause they came and stole it
We from the Bay just keep giving out game
I say it's time we took ownership
Uhhh

[Hook: Rafael Casal]
I just wanna live a little bit of my goals
I been at this for a minute now
Who are you to come and tear us down?
I put on for my town, my town
(My town, my town)

[Verse 2: Clyde Carson]
Heard that I been rapping for a minute
Where I'm from ain't got the tendency to feel it
Too much sauce to conceal it
Cup running through but keep spillin'
Feelin' myself like I'm M.D
2Pac soon as he just got free
I been dope be careful don't OD
They all just wanna hang out with the OG
Oh no
Got another rapper that I'm hearing
Tryna sound like he's from here again
Oh whoa
I could feel the work that I've been doing paying off
Obviously it's apparent
No show
It's a lotta talk, errytime I come around
Swear to god I never hear it
More dough
If you ever heard anything I ever said
Know I'm only bout the winning

[Hook: Rafael Casal]
I just wanna live a little bit of my goals
I been at this for a minute now
Who are you to come and tear us down?
I put on for my town, my town
(My town, my town)

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
My town might outrun the whole race and
My town might outgun the whole nation
My town, night out clownin', go crazy
Lights out fight, my town don't like waitin'
For you to catch up what we sayin'
Don't like my town, why is you stayin'?
Ride round my town, floss and you payin'
One way or another we takin'
All of your shit, call that tax when
You on that ho shit
We got stacks but
You do not know shit about what GOAT is
If you did not grow up around Oakland
Left the Bay when I was 18, dummy
Came back at 22
Four years was enough to know
I had way more shit left to do in
My town
