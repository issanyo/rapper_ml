[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Look
They say it's gonna rain today
Weather.com on my stupid smartphone got me fucked from jump
Maybe it'll wash these stains away
Streets littered with police tape cause something jumped off last night man, ok
I voted on the second it's the fifth and I'm already impatient for change
I got rent to pay
Ducking my fucking landlord
He a'ight but really I got nothing to say
Rips in the bottom of my jeans
I can't blame the gene pool
Plenty of my peoples is doing good
Sips from a bottle of that lean
I don't do it often but somehow today it sound good
Pick who to follow in my dreams
The hare or the hatter
Which is better to snatch me a good Alice
Either I'm stressed or I'm crazy so it seems
Tea-time today ain't bringing me nothing but new malice
Chalice up, pedal down got me feeling free
I worry about my DUI you worry about your IUD
Tonight I gotta fuck to feel something
C'est la vie
Sometimes you look at life and really don't like what you see

[Hook]
I just gotta get out--

--of this moment
The rain makes the windows a pretty worthy opponent

Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me
Please don't let me fall

In all this trying to get it all
Sometimes you find the [?] hit the wall

I don't wanna slip down

Where this takes me
I'm strong but the fall might break me

Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me
Please don't let me fall

In all this trying to get it all
Sometimes it seems like there's no one to call


[Verse 2]
Car won't start
I'm officially an artist
And I go through my day playing who can front the hardest
Turn on the TV, see a cop who shot a kid
Getting seven months' sentencing for everything he did
Now I'm blowing the situation out of proportion maybe
Cause I want to blow my city up so folks see that I'm crazy
And I probably won't blow up artistically because I'm lazy
And it's the same reason I ain't throwing this brick till someone pays me
Wow
How's that for priorities?
Apparently honest is something I can't afford to be
I'm Charlie Parker scrapple from every apple afforded me
Cause Honeysuckle Rose is exposed as bourgeois absurdity
Okay, just got too deep for two minutes, get two beats not two piece too many offending my true minions
I mean listeners
I mean fans, I know you are
If you knew I was this crazy would you still make me a star?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My cell phone is long distance
Ain't that some shit?
As hard as I rep the Bay I should probably change the digits
But everybody already knows this one
This one's got somewhere to go, this one
This run's gonna be the longest run
This one is one of a kind, as mama said
And mama sighed
And mama, can I borrow a five until the 15th?
And this one's gonna make it big baby
Diversify your egg baskets maybe
Easter's looking light
This year I blame the bunny
And we right back to that hare/hatter mad ain't that funny?
How my songs are as circular as my logic
As my track
As the disc I feel slipping every morning in my back and I'm pissed
At my body
At odds with my chances
Trying to write songs to make people do dances
But this morning I'm just working on standing, you dig?
Instead I hit the snooze button again

[Hook]
