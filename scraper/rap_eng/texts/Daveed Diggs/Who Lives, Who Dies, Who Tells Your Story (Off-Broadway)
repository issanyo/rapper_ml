[ELIZA]
"My very dear Eliza, this letter will not be delivered to you unless I shall first have terminated my earthly career to begin a happy immortality.  I'd need not tell you of the pangs I feel from the idea of quitting you and exposing you to the anguish which I know you would feel.  Nor could I dwell on the topic lest it should unman me.  Fly to the bosom of your God and be comforted.  With my last idea; I shall cherish the sweet hope of meeting you in a better world.  Adieu best of wives and best of women.  Ever yours, Alexander."

[WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[BURR]
President Jefferson:

[JEFFERSON]
With Hamilton gone, I dismantled the Federalist party
He did leave us with good credit though
I got Louisiana on sale

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[BURR]
President Madison:

[MADISON]
He was in a position to enrich himself a thousand ways, and he didn't
Does that make him foolish
Or honest?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[ANGELICA]
Every other founding father story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

[BURR]
And when you're gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?
