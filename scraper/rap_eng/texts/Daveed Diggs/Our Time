[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Cold winter
Sittin' on the table, cold dinner
Wine gone but the lipstick mark on the glass let him know you had more than a
Casual acquaintance
With whoever you had left with at 2:15 in the PM
Plus you been ignoring all his DMs
And the last text that you left said you'll see him on the weekend

"Oh, you talk about love like you mean it," he sings to himself
But no, that's a man and he just got to see it, babe

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
You pay no attention to the way the blinds seem to move when there isn't a wind
Or the silence you get when you answer blocked numbers
You already know that it's him
Underwear on the floor, girl
Lead him right to the door, girl
And that necklace he gave you that you said you loved
Was all tangled and tore
And his world was too cause his world was you
When you tryin' to fight another world war
What the fuck did you expect a man to do?
Swallow it all, did you swallow it too?
He wonders and wallows and waits in the closet

[Nailah Middleton]
There's something about you, you got me
I don't know about you without me
It's gotta be me and you forever, love
It's our time
Come here babe, come here babe, come here babe
It's gotta be me and you forever, love
Now come here babe, come here babe, come here babe
It's our time

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Hot summer
At the payphone for the blocked number
She walked there fast cause she know you would always answer
Unless you was gettin' some ass
Fuckin' cute little laugh at the end of your outgoing message
As if nothing matters at all while she over here stressing to death
Does she have bigger breasts or just give better head?

"Oh, you talk about love like you mean it," she sings to herself
But no, she a woman and when something changes she see it, babe

[Verse 4: Daveed Diggs]
Tell the next one you with not to trip off the rips
In the tires or that thing might want to block certain numbers
Cause sooner or later you know she gon open the satellites
She stops by the window of the Walgreens
Her mascara a mess of a mask
Gonna pull out a tissue but instead pulls out a phone for a text
And the flask rattles round in the purse
A reminder that medicine is already there for the taking
And the snap when she puts the cap back
She's convinced is the sound of her heart breaking

[Nailah Middleton]
Every night you've got me dreamin'
Don't wanna wake up without you
Sleep don't come easy for me, this is your time
Every day I wait for sundown
Hopin' that you might come back round
Just turn around I am waiting there for your lie

[Nailah Middleton]
There's something about you, you got me
I don't know about you without me
It's gotta be me and you forever, love
It's our time
Come here babe, come here babe, come here babe
It's gotta be me and you forever, love
Now, come here babe, come here babe, come here babe
It's our time

[Nailah Middleton]
There's something about you, you got me
I don't know about you without me
It's gotta be me and you forever, love
It's our time
Come here babe, come here babe, come here babe
Come here babe
Come here babe, yeah, come here babe, come here babe
It's our time
