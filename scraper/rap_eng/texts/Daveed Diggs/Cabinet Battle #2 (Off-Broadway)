[WASHINGTON]
The issue on the table: France is in the middle of their own revolution. Do we commit aid and troops to this alliance or do we declare neutrality? Remember, my decision on this matter is not up to congressional approval. Secretary Jefferson, you have 45 seconds

[JEFFERSON]
-clears throat-
When we were on death’s door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Uh, who provided those funds?

[MADISON]
...France

[JEFFERSON]
In return, they didn’t ask for land
Only a promise that we’d lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I’ll remind you he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smelling like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh!!

[JEFFERSON]
Oh, uh, and if ya

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
Don’t know, now ya know, Mr. President

[WASHINGTON]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
Secretary Hamilton, your reply?
45 seconds

[ELIZA]
Let it go!

[HAMILTON]
You must be out of your goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?”
"Oh… I can't hear him, he's super dead!”

[WASHINGTON]
Enough! Hamilton is right

[JEFFERSON]
Mr. President—

[WASHINGTON]
We’re too fragile to start another fight

[JEFFERSON]
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

[WASHINGTON]
Sure, when the French figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em

[JEFFERSON]
The people are leading—

[WASHINGTON]
The people are rioting
There’s a difference. Frankly, it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Draft a statement of neutrality
