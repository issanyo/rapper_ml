Born in the winter and cold chillin'
The fire in the belly of burnt building
Started with the roof and it worked down
Went from a block to a whole town
Moved from the town to the big city
Built out of bricks so it felt gritty
Hammer to the bricks 'til they break down
And slang them rocks to the folk now
Started with a gram from the OG's
Went from a gram to a whole key
Doors open quick when you knock right
Knocks on the block with a hot pipe
Pipes bring the water to wash in it
The water come right to the faucet
The facets, too many to keep track
Walk it to the track where the freaks at
Peek at where people don't speak at
Or speak out or they knockin' teeth out
Molar, amoral immortality for the colder
The polar's your humanity can be written
Is spittin' the bars are behind them
Bangin' on tables and tattin' the line on your chest
Where your secrets are kept tight
Say it with your chest when you get right
That shit's a mess but shit, that's life
Back to reality, bad price for juice
So you keep buying drink
Just drink so you don't have to think much
The blink of an eye and you're faded
Dark coming like surrender in Vegas
Hit the light 'cause it's better to pretend
Keep rapping, don't let the beat end
Just keep rapping, don't let 'em see in
Just keep rapping, like it was breathin'
Just keep rapping, beggin' 'em please, man
Just keep rapping, all in your knees, stand
Just keep rapping, don't let the beat end
Keep rapping, don't let 'em see in
Just keep rapping, like it was breathin'
Just keep rapping, beggin' 'em please, man...
