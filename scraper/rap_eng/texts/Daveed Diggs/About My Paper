[Intro 1: Voice Over Radio]
Attention everyone:
This is an emergency broadcast
The unpleasant noise you are about to hear coming from your radio is not a mistake
Please do not turn off your radio but turn up the volume on your receiver as high as it can go
So that you can make the sound we broadcast as loud as possible

[Intro 2: Daveed Diggs]
Yo
Hey now, don't put nothin' else
Yeah, just leave the drums, just like that
I don't know, I like it
I fucks wit' it watch
Hold up hold up watch
Look
Right here

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
I'm locked
Loaded up Yoda to the turf
YOLO to the finna answer to your Google search
I'm perked
Amplified
Wired off this kombucha from a city would guarantee
There's fifty niggas that'll shoot you for no reason
Season bets sneezin' out yo Nasonex
Reason to your logic out of pocket with that [?] breath
Meanin' I breathe bullets
And meanin' and lead pullin' this heap
For a meter or so up out of my sleeve
Come up out of your sleep
Dreamin' like Freddy gon' getcha
To wake up to a dawn wit' Diggs eatin' niggas with every lecture
Hannibal Lecter
Cannibal, yes sir
Cliche handler and scandal servin' expert
Candle her distressed words leaving from they breath nurse
Heavin' in they chest, knowin' D go' need to flex
Time bomb ticking kicking rhymes song spittin' nigga
Ridiculous tripping though he grinding when he grittin'
Timing when he sittin'
Choosing when he pick him
Chosen when they lickin' lips
Frozen when they kiss him
You know we on a mission bring that bass shit back
Baby get up out the way and let that bass shit crack
Like it back when Diggs dig it can ya holla like Leroy?
Check my name check me sway the original D boy

[Chorus: Big Sizz]
I'm about my paper
You can catch me on my block
Sprayin' 16 bars a pop
I'm about my paper
Nigga go hard at the streets
Gettin' money every day of the week
I'm about my paper
Scraper turned up sideways
City to city on highways
I'm about my paper
Niggas say "I don't go"
Every day your chick jack my flow
I'm about my paper

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Nigga I'm a hustler
You sink me to the bone
Think of being a customer
I'll charge you for a poem
Swing you when you break some bars
And bring it to your home
Spittin' all these bullets
Push them straight up to your dome

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Paper rock scissors cut a rapper so vicious
Eat 'em up delicious gonna' dirty these dishes
Diggs, ya figure huh, wishin' for a trigger huh
Happy as a snicker
What a tragedy to split ya wig
Wear it out with what words
Grits guts, verbs
Rip ya sores
Vocal chords oh so sore
It's a drought in the Bay
You can catch me on tour
I skipped Yay slang and went straight to slang bangin'
Gangs on the turf I don't care what they sayin'
Chains danglin' I'm a wrangler man stranglin' game
With a new single that he done sang in the pen dang
And the pen game, exquisite, isn't it?
And what I been sayin'
Is bigger than a ziploc can hold my lips locked and loaded
When his Glock explode
Know Diggs talk I'm quoted for the world
Me and Unc Hus bus' truth
Take it from the block to the booth
Take it from the booth to the stage
Take it from the stage
To all the fans watching on the Youtube page
See them haters get mad when they Getback squad up
They say it's bad for the kids well pick that child up
Don't see no reason for you gettin' hot as you got
What I just showed 'em how to flip that product
Shit

[Chorus: Big Sizz]

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]

[Bridge: Daveed Diggs & Big Sizz]
Diggs
Sizz, my nigga
Say me?
Yeah
Sizz
A'ight, get on this shit bruh gimme some of that waterfront
Get me some gasoline to spit
I need some water on it
I spit gasoline!

[Verse 3: Big Sizz]
Always on my job like I'm on top of the buildin'
Money is my girlfriend I think she catchin' feelins
Bitch I'm from the water but I don't be swimmin'
Could be from the freezer 'cuz I'm always chillin'
All about my paper like a paper shredder
That pussy's so good I just can't forget her
Yeah she hot but I don't sweat her
Always pull out so I don't regret her
Swag real heavy
Drink real strong
Yes I'm here
But really I'm gone
Back back to the money, where else would I be?
Broke broke motherfuckers never ever see me
Imma get money boy Imma die tryin' to get it
You wannabe players gon' die tryna' hit it
Nigga you could have her 'cuz I hit it and I quit it
It's the gasoline spitter how else would I spit it?
See ya!

[Chorus: Big Sizz]

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
