[Intro: Daveed Diggs]
Uh
What you know about it
Go boi

Raphael Casal
Getback
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
My city got a million rappers, why? (tell it)
Coz we talk game same way the hawk fly (ok)
Plus for Gs these bars is alibis
I didn't do it I was in the studio, right?
Ugh (ha)
I ain't a killer but I understand
I ain't a dealer but I know a gram (right)
I don't conceal 'em but I know a man who do and I ain't mad at him
Get your money nigga
Shit
(Get your money nigga)
This is big bucks shit put your wrists up (put em up)
All that ice must be making you a sick fuck
Not e'rybody built their houses outta bricks but (what)
The market crash e'rybody wanna flip, huh?
And you ain't ever seen me in a trap before
And you ain't ever seen me strapped running from the po
My family has been destroyed by the crack so
Don't see how I can glorify it in a rap tho
I do love crack rap slap it in my car
Rollin' through the dirty thirties tryna look hard
This is probably why I feel outta place
Making music that make white college kids feel safe
(Speak about it)
So what you're left with is a combination of a scholar and a lack of forty acre compensation
And I'm rapping for a title they can't take back
So what nigga
(So what nigga)
Gimme that

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
They don't really wanna say my name
But they gotta if they wanna talk about this game coz I
Gimme that
Gimme that
Go boi
They don't really wanna see my town
But they gunna if they wanna talk about this sound coz we
Gimme that
Gimme that
Go boi

[Verse 2: Raphael Casal]
Hey yo
God I'm good
Bay boy warming the col' world
I'm comin' hard like a chick with her toes curled
Welcome to the yard pitbulls and pinchers inserters
Pitchers and snifters sip yers for bros hoes
If that your chick it's yo' girl
She's on a motherfucker and I'm loving me some OPP
Keep it lowkey don't provoke the OPD
We say why when we enter like it's county G
Tryna learn me the way of the fam and not the whip but the opera monster that keeps creepin' in the strip
I'm baggin' me a leaf from the rafters
I ain't schemin' til actors quit dreaming of being this kind of pimp
You talk a big plan but damn I don't see it
Don't talk I just do I mister bean it
I seen a lot of big losers wanna beef it
But I'm Bueller suckers as you were
Leave it

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Fiends wipe your sniffles
Boy ballin' like wiffle (wuh)
Got the game crippled like a baby need a nipple
Call me elmo coz I'm tickled
When I leave suck a spickle
Gettin' crazy with the nickel
But don't worry coz Im fickle
So you know I'll be right back
Look at the crew name (uh)
Getback bring the fire like butane
Light your pipe like your life likes the new game
Heavy's dead already since the levy truth stain
And truth hurts like a cymbal don't clear
But it's only money honey stop looking so severe (yeah)
Revered like Paul warn em all Diggs coming
Stand tall swing rap axe black Paul Bunyan
Blue ox running through
Crew socks cruising too
You not losing this
Dudes no illusionist
Who's hot who's not bruised your contusion
Still confused lemme school you
Getback's the conclusion
Pull up a chair nigga find you some space
Me beatin' the snare mean a change of pace (uh)
See this is probably why I feel outta place
Tryna make the same music e'rybody else makes (tell it)
So I make shake right
Gettin' my cape right
Lettin' them know they ain't right hatin' the bay
I got it pumpin' through my blood make your boy go dumb
Find me runnin' anywhere you hear these drums like

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
