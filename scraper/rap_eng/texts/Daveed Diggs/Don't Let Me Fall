[Intro: Daveed Diggs and Moe Green]
Don't let the days of your life pass you by
Sometimes it's just one of those days, you know?

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Looks like it's 'bout to rain today
Weather.com on my stupid smartphone got me fucked from jump
Maybe it'll wash these stains away
Streets riddled with police tape cause something jumped off last night man, ok
I voted on the second it's the fifth and I'm already impatient for change
I got bills to pay
Ducking my fucking landlord
He a'ight but really I got nothing to say
Rips in the bottom of my jeans
I can't blame the gene pool
Plenty of my peoples is doing good
Sips from a bottle of that lean
I don't do it often but somehow today it sounds good
Pick who to follow in my dreams
The hare or the hatter
Which is better to snatch me a good Alice
Either I'm pissed or I'm crazy so it seems
Tea-time today ain't bringing me nothing but new malice
Chalice up, pedal down got me feeling free
I worry about my DUI you worry about your IUD
Tonight I gotta fuck to feel something
C'est la vie
Sometimes you look at life and really don't like what you see

[Hook: Lauren Nagel and Daveed Diggs]

I just gotta get out--

--of this moment
The rain makes the windows a pretty worthy opponent

Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me
Please don't let me fall

In all this trying to get it all
Sometimes it feels like you done hit the wall

I don't wanna slip down

Where this takes me
I'm strong but the fall might break me

Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me fall
Please don't let me
Please don't let me fall

In all this trying to get it all
Sometimes it seems like there's no one to call


[Verse 2: Moe Green]
Bankrupt city
Everything closed down downtown just a bull town, where's the life?
Tuesday through Saturday
Three AM, clocking in
Chump change pocketing
Dream they stopping here
My fear's dropping tears in front of peers
Let me out
As a child I was put down to get down
Walking for a reason so I marching for the beat my son
Praying on the daily standing looking for the reason
The bills ain't paid, they late
They been to my car
The pain in my heart but I practice looking hard
The life on Sonoma Boulevard, live raw
Who make it out
Who they are
Who the truest are
One life to live
No soap, live dirtier
Working on handling a heart without hurting her
Moe Green signing off
One day, problem solved
Till then, the aches and pains?
Walk 'em off
Free

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
My cell phone is long distance
Ain't that some shit?
As hard as I rep the Bay I should probably change the digits
But everybody already knows this one
This one's got somewhere to go, this one
This run's gonna be the longest run
This one is one of a kind, as mama said
And mama sighed
And mama, can I borrow a five until the 15th?
And this one's gonna make it big baby
Diversify your egg baskets maybe
Easter's looking light
This year I blame the bunny
And we right back to that hare/hatter mad ain't that funny?
How my songs are as circular as my logic
As my track
As the disc I feel slipping every morning in my back and I'm pissed
At my body
At odds with my chances
Trying to write songs to make people do dances
But this morning I'm just working on standing, you dig?
Instead I hit the snooze button again
(Come on man)

[Hook]
