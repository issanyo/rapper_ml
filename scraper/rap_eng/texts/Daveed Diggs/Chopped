[Intro: Daveed Diggs]
Yeah
Uh huh
Look

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
I got the squad in here (in here)
Brought the muhfuckin' mob in here, boy
We been on our job this year
So run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped), chopped (chopped)

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Uh I got the juice now
Fuckin' with me 'cause I got the juice now
Y'all been busy picking out your fruit
I been trippin' 'round the world spittin'
Stackin' up this loot (ow)
Still nobody know me though
They just know we got a style they never heard before
Wanna consolidate it to a word they know
But they ain't got no language for this shit that we been slangin'
Ho, it's danger though (know that)
Sugar water and Prozac
Suckin' up all that sweet shit
Tootsie Rolls like you Kojak
Well fuck it, who loves you baby
These suckers been tryna play me
That's lotto with hollow tips
If you pickin' bones, don't be lazy
That Jenga stack is looking wobbly
Like a gust of wind might come in and fuck up your whole monopoly
The problem is you thought this was a game from jump
I came in about my bid'ness, took aim and pump
Go 'head, pick up the pieces (pick up the pieces)
Pray to your painfully average white Jesus
A fear of failure and hell is the basis of your thesis
Come talk to a real monster, let me show you what a beast is

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Got the squad in here (in here)
Brought the muhfuckin' mob in here, boy
We been on our job this year
So run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped)
Chopped (chopped)

Uh I got the juice now
Oh, you wanna squeeze me for my juice now?
You talking Genghis shit but where's the proof, boy?
Run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped), chopped (chopped)

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Doors open, rolling down West Grant
Yes ma'am
Curve 'em like a question
Mark I got a deadpan
Demeanor at the moment meaning try me
Son your ass so hard it make your mama high five me
I be all up in your blood like a IV
Ivy League credentialled back when ooh I think they like me
Made dem boys a franchise
I was standing man size
Mayonnaise sandwich in my hand thought I was damn wise
Landed on my damn site wiser now
Catch the wizard rising out the earth see
Check the competition in the hearse see
Check the checks deposited for verse three
All the words they paying for are just me tryna burst free
Bird out the guitar solo more Charlie Parker on the alto
In the whip to Vegas and we just passed by Rialto
Me and my dogs we hungry and we comin' for that Alpo
All of us got bars so heavy they like "Where the Valco?"
But these muscles au naturalle
Watch me flip some bullshit into a cash cow
Milk the game for everything she worth and then back out
Pail in hand you palin' in comparison, so back down

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Got the squad in here (in here)
Brought the muhfuckin' mob in here, boy
We been on our job this year
So run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped)
Chopped (chopped)

Uh got the juice now
Oh, you wanna squeeze me for my juice now?
You talking Genghis shit but where's the proof, boy?
Run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped)
Chopped (chopped)

[Verse 3: Rafael Casal]
Yuh, yuh
Fuck a popped collar (woo)
I'm a Rotweiler (yuh)
Ready and rotten off o' the toxin with a subdued posture (yuh)
Evolved and often I'm a new monster
Been a minute since I had a Bruce Banner moment
But don't confuse calmer (no)
With a weeping willow
I'm a sneaky silhouette
Slippin' through your window leaving
Swimmers on your bitch's pillow
Gentleman until I'm pushed to corners (yuh)
Then I gotta remind 'em what kind am I from this Northern California
Slinking forward over this sink I just threw up in
Told Shawn I was done with Robutissin
But listen up I doesn't
Feeling vindicated but I know my thug is bubblin'
Hood in you is always cookin' underneath these public functions
Public discussions just pushing my buttons
Who are these trumpin' supporters?
Are they confused or concussioned?
Is this the KKK or have they just been sippin' the Kool-Aid?
Why do we follow the devil? He just money and toupees
I'm from the water, underrated nation 'til I'm done playin'
Then got a bodyback waiting for anyone claiming A1
If you ain't one, I suggest you vacate the station
I've been patient, but you better pray
They don't let me up in this new formation 'cause
I'm your favorite rapper's most hated rapper (yuh)
If I get on, he ain't sure he making playoffs after (ooh)
Juice boys got the best brew
And I hate to toot my own horn
But I mean bruhmp motherfucker bruhmp
Yo

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Got the squad in here (in here)
Brought the muhfuckin' mob in here, boy
We been on our job this year
So run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped)
Chopped (chopped)

Uh I got the juice now
Oh, you wanna squeeze me for my juice now?
You talking Genghis shit but where's the proof, boy?
Run up if you wanna get chopped (chopped)
Chopped (chopped)

[Outro]
Rise and shine, Mr. Hoskins. You don't wanna be late
