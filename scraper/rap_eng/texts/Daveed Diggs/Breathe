Breathe
Let it out
I'm awkward by nature, not by choice
At times it feels dangerous to use my voice
In a room full of strangers
Speaking can feel poisonous
Lungs too collapsible
Can't be too boisterous
Why pay attention when they mistake tension
For poise
Breathe
Let it out
Breathe
Let it out
Breathe
Let it out
And with every feeling that makes a shadow of a doubt
Breath is a blessing
You do it from the moment you bounce up
Breathe and you breathe
And you scream
And you shout
And you dance cause you're able
To make the ceiling the table
Your inhibition a fable
My love, time for the cradle to rock
Breath is more than a clock that is ticking moments
Clock constantly tocking
Until the second you stop
Don't stop
Breathe
Let it out
Breathe
Let it out
Inhale, exhale
The weight doesn't make sense
All it entails is living so why we so intense
We in rarified air
We make it in
Two breaths
Let the breath be the way we move the body and mind past
A statement of purpose
Let every breath be an opus
And open to overturn owed to the obvious
Who would be anybody in motion
Please keep the body in motion
Embodying motion
We bottled emotion
Too often you sang
Oh cry me an ocean
But this song is delicious cause it treats the wounds
You got scars
I got scars too
The tissue will make us hard
The tears wash us anew
We are harder than doubt had bargained with
Been battling with the truth
We put bars on the windows to keep us off the roof
Same bars in a kids room so they don't pop the rules
Same bars that I'm spittin in hopes it'll make us move
And remove the bars that are blinders
So we don't see what you do, what you do
Oh don't drop the sign
Then bring to the face the smoke to the lung
The facts of a race great that's yet to be run
We can start any day
Why are we waitin for the gun
We can borrow our way back to the place where the drum claps
Mistakes that become gravity
Wait for the world purpose
It's pulling us all
And ain't it better to jump baby than wait for the fall
If you go down swinging they singing
The pallbearers
The Marshall will bring all the beads out
And march with me
That's as tight as it goes with the flow
Yet the puppet is coming so you might as well blow
A hundred miles of running
And don't nobody know there's nobody that likes trying to swallow you whole
Push it back
Push it back
Go
Push it back
Let the sweat from your back be the water for your action
Push it back
Push it back
Go
Push it back
Ain't nobody pushing on you but you know I got your back
Push it back
Push it back
Go
Push it back
Let the sweat from your back be the water for your action
Push it back
Push it back
Go
Push it back
Let the sweat from your back be the water for your action
You got scars
I've got scars too
You got scars
I've got scars too
You got scars
I've got scars too
The tissue will make us hard
The tears wash us anew
We are harder than doubt had bargained with
Been battling with the truth
Your scars are beauty marks, but don't let em define you
