[Intro]
Only talking the fliest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only smoking the finest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only fucking with dimes and shit (Wear the wounds)
Only rocking designer shit (Wear the wounds)

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Just getting money but they call it trapping
What the fuck did you think was gonna happen?
Turn into hunters, they shooting gorillas
Just going hunting they calling them killers
Killing the game like he shot up an -opoly
Fuck up the hotel, your board walk is toppling
If you ain't a designer you're broke or you're crazy
Pockets are swole like they having a baby
This shit gonna pop
Everyone hitting the block
Whipping up chicken they spit in the pot
Step on it quick
Get it off like you was jerking a dick
Grip on it tight
Try not to fall off the cliff mothafuckas this slick cocoa butter all over the skin robbing you while they grinning in your face and taking your paper
You look like a marked and they question your gangsta
Stack up the counters, they might take you serious
Either that or you bloody they ass, period

[Chorus]
Only talking the fliest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only smoking the finest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only fucking with dimes and shit (Wear the wounds)
Only rocking designer shit (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
The fire is lit and it's burning too fast
They calling it rapping but really it's gas
Seeing through you is like looking through glass
Crying Mr. Cellophane looking ass
Fuck what you talking, you really ain't serious
You a joke like (?), delirious
So many whips it's The Fast and The Furious
Monkey-ass motherfucker lookin' Curious George in the stores
Women just looking for (?)
Gentleman drinking of course
Stay on the course
No names they talking in code like it's Morse
*bleep* got down on the floor
Reach for the 2 little drawers
Shoot up the dressing room first but still lookin' for more
That's how it go when you live in the (?)
It ain't a Black Card if that shit is declining
Fuck what you selling, Ain't nobody buyin'
You ain't got that work then you should be applying

[Chorus]
Only talking the fliest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only smoking the finest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only fucking with dimes and shit (Wear the wounds)
Only rocking designer shit (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
$300 sneakers, $500 jeans
The thin (?), they actin' out a dream
The jeans were baby blue, the t-shirt was cold white
He was wearing red by the end of the night
Everyday you be hustling, everynight you be huddling
Caped up with someone cuddling trying not to get up again
But the alarm start ringing, you leaving and telling lies
To the girl who's not believe the lack of lust in your eyes
Getting brain ain't a thang, getting fly is
Getting paid, it's the way, get the fly shit
Cause you getting paid, (?), you is
So they jumping off the roofs, seeing who the fliest
Out on the corner early, a pocket full of Rocks
Last night they took out Curly, they bloodied up his socks
Talk to the brothers downtown, they all up in they stops
Uptown they call up Ricky to knock him out the box

[Chorus]
Only talking the fliest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only smoking the finest shit (Wear the wounds)
Only fucking with dimes and shit (Wear the wounds)
Only rocking designer shit (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

On that mouth full of diamond shit (Wear the wounds)
On that (?) big timing shit (Wear the wounds)
On that fuck up yo mind and shit (Wear the wounds)
Only rocking designer shit (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)

Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you
Seeing right through you (Wear the wounds)
