[Intro: Phillip Best]
Can you do the chickenskin swim?
Can you do the chlorine gargoyle?
Can you do the chickenskin swim?
Can you wriggle like an eel?

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Drop it down when it hit the blood
A milligram in the eyeball, good enough
Gotta love it, tho, it don’t hurt no more
But the problem is, you’re too vertical (Get low)
Let it penetrate, a little bit of pain
Never hurt nobody, better work your body
Better than the last motherfucker wasn’t nobody
But he left a lot of fluid on the floor, no sorry

[Chorus]
Don’t move, get slapped
Can’t run, bring it back
Tighten up, stay strapped
Make it red, make it clap, clap
Clamp that mouth shut, bounce for your boy
Rip for your girl, scream for your life, beg for a minute
Live it like you might not get another one
The loving in your body only the beginning of it
Let 'em know that you can show off, show off (work)
Show off, show off (work) Show off, show off (work)
Show off, show off (work that shit)
It’s all right, it’s okay, work all night, cry all day
Come inside, you gotta pay, you know that you wanna play

[Pre-Chorus: Best]
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel

[Hook]
Wriggle like a fish, girl, wriggle like a snake, girl
Wriggle like a worm, girl, wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a fish, girl, wriggle like a snake, girl
Wriggle like a worm, girl, wriggle like an eel

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Is it tight enough, is it wet enough?
Got the Novocaine, is it dead enough?
Gettin’ fed of what, is it rent to bust?
Is it everything you thought of in your head, trust
You wanna shake something or somebody might break it for you
What you wanna break, it wasn’t in the conversation
You always hoped to experience domination
Wriggle it right and you might get an ovation
An orgasm, but be patient
It won’t happen with no waiting
They want action, they been chasing
You been flashing, so ass up

[Hook]
Don’t move, get slapped
Can’t run, bring it back
Tighten up, stay strapped
Make it red, make it clap, clap
Clamp that mouth shut, bounce for your boy
Rip for your girl, scream for your life, beg for a minute
Probably shoulda hollered if it was’t what you wanted
But you got the world waiting, now to prove to everybody
You could show off, show off (work)
Show off, show off (work) Show off, show off (work)
Show off, show off (work that shit)
It’s all right, it’s okay, work all night, cry all day
Come inside, you gotta pay, you know that you wanna play

[Pre-Chorus: Best]
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel

[Hook]
Wriggle like a fish, boy, wriggle like a snake, boy
Wriggle like a worm, boy, wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a fish, boy, wriggle like a snake, boy
Wriggle like a worm, boy, wriggle like an eel

[Bridge: Daveed Diggs]
He been a bad bad boy
She been a bad bad girl
Talking’ bout you bad, sad boy
They want you have that girl
Where you get that ass, huh
What you doing with that, huh
You done let it out, huh
Can’t have it back, what

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Slide to the left like it’s lube on the floor
What a beautiful move when you reach for the door
Like they woulda made the straps loose enough for that
This ain’t your first rodeo show
Maybe you better act like you know how to ride it like a pogo
They don't want me slow mo, don’t stop (go, go, go)
The moon calypso, but use the pole, tho
Then flip the whole show, and drip like Soul Glo

[Chorus]
Don’t move, get slapped
Can’t run, bring it back
Tighten up, stay strapped
Make it red, make it clap, clap
Clamp that mouth shut, bounce for your boy
Rip for your girl, scream for your life, beg for a minute
Everybody wanna be a star but don’t nobody wanna work it
For the privilege, you better just get into it
And show off, show off (work), show off, show off (work)
Show off, show off (work), show off, show off (work that shit)
It’s all right, it’s okay, work all night, cry all day
Come inside, you gotta pay, you know that you wanna play

[Pre-Chorus: Best]
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a

Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like a
Wriggle like an eel

[Hook]
Wriggle like a fish, girl, wriggle like a snake, girl
Wriggle like a worm, girl, wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a fish, girl, wriggle like a snake, girl
Wriggle like a worm, girl, wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a fish, boy, wriggle like a snake, boy
Wriggle like a worm, boy, wriggle like an eel
Wriggle like a fish, boy, wriggle like a snake, boy
Wriggle like a worm, boy, wriggle like an eel
