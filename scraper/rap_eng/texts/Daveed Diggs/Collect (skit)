[Intro: Operator and Daveed Diggs]
You have received a collect call from
(It's clipping, bitch)
To accept this call, please press one now
Or to reject this call, please press two
Thank you for using CTI
Go ahead with your call

Ayo, alright, I gotta make this quick, look

[Verse: Daveed Diggs]
On the run and it don't stop
Guns up in the dope spot
Cocaine dream, what they call that, a hope rock?
Skip stones you know walk water like Jesus
With a mouth full of pills cock harder than trees is
Wood on the dash
THC in the hash
EPT in the snow
YKK up the cash in the duffle
Master the shuffle of most hustlers
Too Hollywood to be in the hood with the customers
Copping is customary after coming through customs with a kilo for these hoes who smuggle the drugs in
Thugging is in the blood
The blood is left on the pavement
These blocks is diseases and no, you can't save it ho
It's clipping, bitch
