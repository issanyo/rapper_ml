Getback
Diggs got the block on fire like a riot
Holler Rodney King and pillage motherfuckers, Iâ€™m a pirate
This rapping is my cannon, this scraper is my ship
Send them to Davy Jones and watch a ghost ride the whip
Strip the beat and I beat it like Michael Jack
Son of a bus driver, I'm steering this here rap
Commandeering a whole year with peer-to-peer fear tactics
Do not fear what you hear on my MySpace, nigga that's practice
Mo'fuckers need to step up their praxis
I got mouthpiece couldn't give a fuck what the facts is
You know the deal, stay black, death and taxes
How'd you know [?] sans fat suit
If you get that reference you's a nerd like me
Not like Pharrell, my quirk's for real
Won't hurt my sales, ain't got a deal
So for now imma be spitting whatever I feel, nigga
I feel like whilin' and I feel like smokin'
I feel like "You feel me?" Nigga, that's Oakland
I feel like shootin', I feel like scrapin'
I feel hella sorry for you suckers that's hatin'
I feel like
I feel like can't nobody see me on the spittin'
Cause I be getting out of body with my written
And I don't care about your 20/20 vision
I feel like a lot of hard artists started bullshittin'
And I'm stepping in it with my size 12s
On my town biz, staying fly as hell
Show my ass so the world kiss and tell
Me what they want, like I was a wishing well
Throw a penny, get head for my tails
And it really ain't got shit to do with record sales
Don't push weight but I might sing scales
And I tip 'em when I'm flipping these scripts like yay-oh
Hail to the chief
You know I got that fire get you higher than a leaf
Shit, it gets you higher than the god of your belief be residing, so it seems
That you Jesus-loving sinners might just want to pray to me
Cut the middleman, call me skittleman
Cause I rock them candy colours and my car be little and
Well shit
I be little like [?]
Put my CD in your deck and watch the Plymouth Rock
Like a rockstar
Like a comet
So sick with it watch for the vomit
Feeling shorty filling a gin and tonic
I feel like in the morning imma make her a omelette
I feel like really they ain't ready for the Bay
But still I got them feeling every word I say
I feel like pumping some 40 and 4-Tay
"I'm feeling myself!" Word up to Mac Dre
Somebody call a doctor
This schizo's on some sus but tomorrow he'll be Wagner
Fresh like I swallowed a whole bottle of Binaca
Hit the right spot, you can feel it in your chakras
Got my khan game up, call me chaka
Seeing is believing in this world of John Proctors
It's child's play how my melody get into you
I tell them what they want to hear and blame it on Miss Tituba
Scapegoated African, so I does
Whatever I want, and ever am what I was
Why try to be it when a real high [?]
[?] be whatever I is
Huh, shit
Two steps in front of the two-step
And brethren were [?] my fingertips they call me a Theremin there I'm in it again
Diggs did it again, like Diggs did it again
Tell them play it again Sam-I-Am, high on pot
Rapping fancy nigga, you don't know what you got
Know it or not, you know it ain't a poet who got
This much disdain for this game, I'm flowing a spot
Look
Like an H-bomb
Like disaster
This future has to come faster
Feeling the ceiling and peeling the plaster
Baby stop kneeling, I just bait the master
I feel like people be so funny 'bout this rappin'
Like it's only certain words that make it happen
But imma bring some new shit back again and crack it
For whether you're cap-peeling or whether you're backpacking
Getback

Goddamnit
