[Verse 1]
Don't move nothin', statue
Shooter 'bout to go nuts, cashew
Need cash off the books, past due
Real cheese for the cooks, rat food
He got drums for that ass, get fucked
Get your face rearranged, Nip/Tuck
Do heavy in the streets, big truck
Get money, get money, that's a stick up
Your wallet or your life, choose one
Come up off the lettuce, crouton
You been sleepin' on the shooters, futon
No donation on computers, move on
Clerk's shittin' in his drawers, skid row
Thought shit was just a hood game, skip rope
Shooter read the face real quick, CliffsNotes
Kissed the shoe with the .45, mistletoe

[Hook]
Shooter, shooter, shooter, shooter
You don't want it with a shooter
Shooter, shooter, shooter
Cause he got guns and the shit gon' bang
Yeah, the shooter brought guns and the shit go bang
Hands up, got guns in this bitch, go bang
Motherfucker better run when this shit go

[Verse 2]
Hangin' off the rooftop, King Kong
Bullets serenade the streets, theme song
Ain't takin' no hits, clean bong
Just need it in an outlet, three-prong
Tired of puttin' in work, weekend
Now we gettin' it shine, sequin
Silence on the gun barrel cause he's sneakin'
Found a spot the pigs can't get to him, vegan
Look at all the folk runnin', marathon
Like they ain't got baggage, carry-ons
Killin' is the best medicine, diagnosis
Got death on his breath, halitosis
Choppin' people like they veggies, Top Chef
Like a game at a carnival, Wyclef
Think you're playing? Just watch, Timex
Cameras roll cause he hot now, Pyrex

[Hook]
Shooter, shooter, shooter, shooter
You don't want it with a shooter
Shooter, shooter, shooter
Cause he got guns and that shit gon' bang
Yeah, the shooter brought guns and the shit go bang
Hands up, got guns in this bitch, go bang
Motherfucker better run when this shit go

[Verse 3]
Got a towel on his face, mophead
Gettin' money in the desert, hot bread
Wish he had a way home, bread crumbs
Drink himself into a coma, red rum
Solider's eyes playin' tricks, sandwich
Need to get more info, bandwidth
Bunch of signs there to read, pamphlets
But that was not to be, Hamlet
Enemy jumped on his back, monkey
Wasn't leavin' no scraps, junkie
He was wavin' his hands, krumping
Whole body like soup, dumplings
Wavin' AKs at him, step team
Finna blow his ass away, jet stream
Leave his brain in the sand, head trips
Caught his ass on demand, Netflix

[Hook]
Shooter, shooter, shooter, shooter
You don't want it with a shooter
Shooter, shooter, shooter
Cause he got guns and that shit gon' bang
Yeah, the shooter brought guns and the shit go bang
Hands up, got guns in this bitch, go bang
Motherfucker better run when this shit go
