Got a world wondering when it’s all gonna burn
Warnings are warm as the block is getting hot as a perm
Get it straight my niggas ain’t waiting for turns
It’s time to take it
Our place in the line ain't a concern

We trace our lines to the 80’s where they threw out the razors
Cutting the white on the table was for ballers and players
Our parents still in the hustle burned the rock into vapors
So hard demeanors when 80’s babies gas on you haters
An era defined by cracks and whether to slip into 'em
We transmitted to the beat and
Then we eat to the beats like communion
Embody these wafers wavering wave at them with the rilo
And stay so deep in the cup
We drink blood and call it mosacto
What up gansta

You really want to bang your set
When we rep gangs chained to tracks
And swing raps like mallets
Its arm and hammers built the ground
For which these crews fight
Though none of us own shit so it's nothing to lose right

You seeing this mobbin' on your television
You can close your eyes, but you’re gonna have to listen
The mouthpiece is a gun, the speech is the ammunition

The camera’s are rolling, and the lights flash
The footage is golden when the night's clash
Capture it quick, we livin' the life fast

Yeah real shit nigga
Out here fingering the kill switch
The bills killed a nigga in the DOA
So when the repo came and sent me Cobain
I made a bed of bones of all the rappers I admire
So that even when I’m sleeping
I can still find inspiration in their fall
Because everybody fall off

I’m at the fiscal cliff face, jumping with a sawed off
Shoot all these fake fly suckers it’s now all's lost anyway
So we can parlay with this molotov cocktail mixologist
Rock sales, and bottom bitches, cock fights
And nigga riches, rock ice, and tunnel vision

Eyes front, focus forward, feed the phenom
Your attention the game can change
I will father invention
Me and Miss Necessity got a thing going on
I keep fucking that chick til your new style is born

You seeing this mobbin' on your television
You can close your eyes but you’re gonna have to listen
The mouthpiece is a gun, the speech is the ammunition

And every Sunday morning we play dominoes with death
Counting spots upon the table
Slamming bones with baited breath
Knowing it’s not enough to build a house
The nigga to your left has the four fold
Waiting for them snake eyes to surface
Here surf sex, there's sleep aid to the infinite insomnia
A whole generation awake immune to marijuana
Cause that’s baseline and that’s nice
But the angles are never right
And we spangle the red and white
With the stars and blues we write

I been howling wolf and sheepish grinning
Look beneath the beating, bleeding, seething city
See we’ve all being G'ing since we were teething
And while searching for the meaning
Misdemeanors of the fleeing folk
Running while holding still
Cup of purple posture leaning

And poets postulate posthumous
The who, what, where and why
But the how escapes us all because our souls are too old to cry
So we banging the best we can
And we doin' it looking fly
And we celebrate independence by shooting guns in the sky

You seeing this mobbin' on your television
You can close your eyes, but you’re gonna have to listen
The mouthpiece is a gun, the speech is the ammunition
