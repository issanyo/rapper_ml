[Intro]
If ever you find yourself beaten and broke
And can't feel the whip for the weight of the yoke
And fear that the night will not turn into day
Remember the darkness will show you the way
It's a long way away, it's a long way away
And Iâ€™m all alone along a long
Long long long long long long way

[Verse 1]
Inside the mind of a man is a massacre
Made up of many a miniature message
And misses the most of it
So convoluted, design for disaster
It's making the best of a universe
Far too expansive to cope with
And he never chose nor was chosen
By metrics that make any sense
And the senses are numbed by emotional stresses

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Verse 2]
Who got time on a string, on a finger?
Nothing to remember but the passage of it
Who got time to let anything linger?
Where it hovers, surely you will learn to love it
Who got time for this love shit anyway?
Gotta survive, isn't that mess enough for him?

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Verse 3]
Set a course, it's a bet upon an endless
Roulette wheel odds are ungodly
As are the odds of the body
Making it through and surviving the gravity shift
The gravitas of which is lost
From the lost thoughts of a being ch-ch-chopped
To a bite size in the light eyes
Beggin' don't eat the messenger
The messages and SOS and other S's
In the language where it goes

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Verse 4]
And somebody gotta keep watch where the watch stops
He talks about his pops in polarity
Fingers fantasize of rocks there will never be
"Land ho!" likely
Lest a hole in the mantle of Heaven
He's demanding the evidence for something
That maybe never was for anyone
He's missing something pretty
He's missing where the air tastes gritty
He's missing the splendor and misery
Of bodies, of cities, of being missed

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Verse 5]
Flesh is weaker than the metal, it is true
But the metal's being moved into a thing it doesn't do
Circuitry is only serviceable as much as it is used
So why don't you use it? 'Til you use it up, abuse it
It is strong, it can take it if you can't
Your sinews are more intuitively designed for dance
Well, it set up a random course safely away from suns
Four-hundred and twenty-three
By a hundred and twelve by fifty-one

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Verse 6]
Inside the mind of a man is a mystery, made up of these centuries
Of mistakes he believes are important to be
Part of his DNA, calls it history
Species with memories longer
Don't bother with sweating the old shit
Maybe it's this time-bound conscience
That keeps him out pushing through nothing
With only the hope brought on by this belief that

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Bridge]
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go yet? Let's go
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go yet? Let's go
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go yet? Let's go
Are you ready to go yet? Let's go

[Hook]
There must be a, better place to
Be somebody, be somebody else

[Outro]
