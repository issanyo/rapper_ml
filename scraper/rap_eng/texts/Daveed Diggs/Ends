[Verse 1]
Ok, watch them birds fly south for the Winter (Winter)
Reup (Rea)
Sofa cushion money for the dinner
Crank that heat up cos the winter's getting colder
The globe is getting warmer
The block is getting hotter
Younguns sippin molly water
Holla, Hallelujuh
A little dab'll do ya
Then gather dapper in the best, a hoody fresh
And full of foolies fully-blockin, pistol-cockin, gansta-walkin
White tee-rockin, gold teeth option, mouthpiece-talkin,White Girl-hawkin
Got the tools, who need a fix
(You? You?)
This shit gon' roto-root ya
You got two choices be the body or the shooter
Both embody a maneuver
(True, true)
Has the ghetto matured?
What they said was manure
Now call it ghetto couture
So it's best to make sure
Ya hood is ghetto de jure
Instagramming the guns
Youtube the roach on the floor
Fuck it
Who is ready to die for it?
The fame that you know is golden
Your face on a t-shirt mean you won and the game is over

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was a middle of a story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot up in the air
See where it come down
See where it come down
Don't look now

Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was somebody in this story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot it in the vein
See if you come down
See if you come down
Don't look now

[Verse 2]
Calluses from counting money
Get a machine
They callus anyway
Skin is a dream
Skin of the teeth
Skinning the beast is easy
You sleeping on peoples skin if you really a G
Murder for sport
Watch the murder report
On the tv with a scorecard and a forty of course
Fantasy killer killing the time
Till another reason to kill up
Another dream come around in this rodeo show
She ride like only a ho
Could and these haters around you talking that bell biv devoe
But if that pussy is poison then the whole block will be dead
It end coz fucking is too personal
You just getting some head
Is nobody get in close
Tongues
Reach it the most
They say the sticks and the stones shit
They forgetting the toast
Bullets hurt worse'er than all that
If they tracing em all back
To the same ones that say you keeping you safe
And it's all bad

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was a middle of a story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot up in the air
See where it come down
See where it come down
Don't look now

Once upon a time
Once upon a time there somebody in this story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot it in the vein
See if you come down
See if you come down
Don't look now

[Verse 3]
Eyes closed
Hands up
Don't look and don't say nothing
Yeah you getting got
But they don't know that you ain't got nothing
Broke robbing the broke
And there's broken pieces of sanity on the floor
Scattered for sure
Jigsaw in the brain
Rorschach is for psychos
Ain't nobody crazy in here
This where logic is vital
The vitamin of environment
Is providing desire for vicodin
And fueling fire for violence
Calling it whiling
While they while away another
The wild claim in profiles
The files on all these hustlers
And they can't catch what never was
And everyone here been a ghost since day one
Say something bitch say something
Everyone's at a loss for words
They wonder why the raps are full of floss and boss and murderers
Cos killing shit is less painful then feeling shit
And the dead can't be defendants
Why live old without a pension

[Chorus]
Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was a middle of a story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot up in the air
See where it come down
See where it come down
Don't look now

Once upon a time
Once upon a time there somebody in this story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Shoot it in the vein
See if you come down
See if you come down
Don't look now

[Outro]
Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was a moral to a story
But fuck it, they need some ends
Scream it in the wind
See who come around
See who come around
Don't look now

Once upon a time
Once upon a time there was an ending to this story
But fuck it
