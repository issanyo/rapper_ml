[Verse 1]
How did you end up here?
Everything seems so clear
Something you must have missed
Why are you laying there waiting for him to say something else?
Nothing is left to say
All that is left is pain
Still, you do nothing but lay and he swear that it’s all a lie
How many tears to cry?
How many times to wake
To silent hostility posing as sleep that you thought would fix?
All of the stones and sticks
Hurled at phones and bricks
And figured this time will be different but clearly it’s all the same
Didn't he call your name?
Once or was that in a dream
Feels like a million years ago, what was it yesterday?
What did he swear you say?
Something 'bout "houses plagued"
Pride and prejudice swinging, a trial you’re always on
You know it won’t be long
How much you can be wrong
Before he realizes you’re human and you got a heart of your own?
Everything here is stone
Break you down to the bone
One day he’ll wake up and you will be gone

[Hook]
This is hustler shit
No love lost
Just blood, no talk
Guns tossed
What’s in a name?
Keep it out your mouth
Swallow your tongue
What you talking ‘bout?
What side is you on?
The game don’t wait
What set you claim?
The same old state
And it’s beef if you want
So jump, motherfucker
Jump, motherfucker (x4)

[Verse 2]
Blood is stuck to your hands
Thought that that was your man
Man if they knew your thoughts
Locked in a box of indifference and there was no getting out
Getting it all around
They know who run this town
But they don’t know who running you when you running from everything
What’s a mob to a king?
Emperors got new clothes
Naked and crying and holding on, what were you fighting 'bout?
Into the lion’s mouth
Never could keep it straight
Something ‘bout being invisible; how could he let you be?
Angry and go to sleep
Give you the coldest stare
Now he is laying there, motionless; why does his chest not move?
What does he wanna prove?
Weren't you always true?
Didn't you give up everything so that you could make it work?
God, he is such a jerk
Daggers don’t mince no words
Why not just end it out here and they’ll never talk shit again
Remember when you were friends?
Everything has to end
But why is it always so sudden with him?

[Hook]
This is hustler shit
No love lost
Just blood, no talk
Guns tossed
What’s in a name?
Keep it out your mouth
Swallow your tongue
What you talking ‘bout?
What side is you on?
The game don’t wait
What set you claim?
The same old state
And it’s beef if you want
So jump, motherfucker
Jump, motherfucker (x4)

[Verse 3]
Two men dead in the street
More vendetta, more beef
Household should be discreet
Dignity gets in the way typically when they’re so alike
Why must these boys all fight?
Guess it’s just in the blood
Just territorial animals; space has been running low
Where else is there to go?
Other than underground
Six feet is perfectly adequate; bring out the yellow tape
Outline them on the street
Of morning’s glooming peace
Nothing is left for the day but the dawn

[Hook]
This is hustler shit
No love lost
Just blood, no talk
Guns tossed
What’s in a name?
Keep it out your mouth
Swallow your tongue
What you talking ‘bout?
What side is you on?
The game don’t wait
What set you claim?
The same old state
And it’s beef if you want
So jump, motherfucker
Jump, motherfucker

[Outro]
This is hustler shit
What you switching for?
No office do business at the liquor store
What’s in a name?
Keep it out your mouth
Think it’s a game?
Shit, walk it out
No birds in the house
We talk metaphor
Keep your flag out
Semaphore
And it’s beef if you want
So jump, motherfucker
Jump, motherfucker (x18)
