{Calvin and Hobbes / Intro}
[Calvin]
Hobbes, old buddy, I hear the call
It's time for us to play a game of Calvin Ball

[Hobbes]
Calvin Ball!

[Calvin]
Yeah, Hobbes, it's the game of the day
Where we make up our own rules, and then we play
Rule #1, you can only be characters from a movie

[Hobbes]
...or a comic strip

[Calvin]
Or a comic strip, but after that just movies

[Hobbes]
...or a TV show

[Calvin]
Or a TV show, but that's where I draw the line

[Hobbes]
Rule 2: take your favorite scene
And then you make it rhyme

[Calvin]
Rule 3: When the scene is run
Move on to another one

[Hobbes]
A musical medley we put together
Just to get it done

[Susie]
This game sounds fun. Can I do a famous moment from history?

[Calvin]
Get out of here, Susie! That's a terrible idea!

[Hobbes]
I think that is such a great idea, Susie!

[Calvin]
That's not something anybody wants to see!
So, let's get the etiquette evident
Now that I said it I'll bet you
Will have to agree

[Hobbes]
What's about to happen
Has not ever happened
A rappin' theatrical movie medley

[Calvin]
We're doing it all in one take

[Hobbes]
There's so much at stake

[Calvin]
There'll be some mistakes, we'll see

[Susie]
We'll be in the building, they 'bout to be killing it
We gotta give them all our energy

{Alice in Wonderland}

[Mad Hatter and Mouse]
A very merry unbirthday to you

[Alice]
A very merry unbirthday to who?

[Mouse]
A very merry unbirthday to you

[Alice]
To me?

[Mad Hatter]
To you

[Mouse]
That’s who!

[Alice]
A very merry unbirthday

[Mad Hatter]
It’s true
A very merry unbirthday
All day and every day until your birthdate
So basically I’m saying that ya been late
I'm mad heated, mad hatted
Mad green and I'm ecstatic to be
Sitting sipping tea and trippin'
Time is chasing me
I may need time to shoot the breeze
I'm making no apologies
As you can see

[Alice]
Pardon me, well, I didn’t think

[Mouse]
You didn’t think?
You didn’t think?
You didn’t think?
Sit down and have a drink
Without thought you have no right to your voice
If you voice your opinions then you always have a choice
If not, you're one of millions
Little minions who's contingent
To give into the conditions
Of a dominant existence
Are you listening?!

[Alice]
Oh, why, yes, I’m obsessed
Curiouser, I'm curious, sir
Make believe makes beliefs so furiously blurred
Incurably absurd with every single word
I’m delighted to decipher the insane from the obscured

A-L-I-C-E, that's me
Knocked on a door that had no key
So I looked through the hole and it turned on me
And I dropped down, dropped down

[Mad Hatter and Mouse]
Low!

[Alice]
Down the rabbit

[Mad Hatter and Mouse]
Hole!

[Alice]
I've been wandering through Wonderland
And wondering who'd understand
I don't do what I'm told

[Mad Hatter and Mouse]
Oh!

[Alice]
See, I drink, drank, drunk that potion
And I shrink, shrank, shrunk, it's potent

[Mad Hatter]
Well, just sip that cup, move down, drink up
It's a tea party, let it soak in

[Alice]
A very merry

[Mad Hatter and Mouse]
A very merry

[Alice]
A very merry unbirthday

[Mouse]
Birthday

[Mad Hatter]
Birthday

[Alice]
To you-ou-ou

{Kill Bill}

[Bride]
Innocent and victim, I’m coming to kill 'em
Innocent and victim, I’m coming to kill 'em
Can’t call me a villain, I’m serving revenge
Plate is getting cold, hate is getting old
Did as I'm told, now I'm looking for ends
Looking for them, they don’t know I got Hanzo
Welcome the blade, domo arigato
Bury the grave, tell me but hey
But I think of Pai Mei and I build my defense
Innocent and victim, I’m coming to kill 'em
Innocent and victim, I’m coming to kill 'em
Innocent and victim, I’m coming to kill 'em
Can’t call me a villain, I’m serving revenge

{Dancing In The Rain]

[Don Lockwood]
Name's Don Lockwood, a silent movie star
But I have some deeper dreams of talkin' screens and fast cars
The ladies always fakin', trying to take my fun to make it
[They be] breaking my heart
Love affairs

Then this lady Kathy danced into my life
Though we [?] Lena Lamont I would never start that fight
She’s [fresh to this test] she’s envisioning new sights
[?] with the best I want to taste she’s got that bite

Romance must be heard, but I can’t just speak about it
The rain [?] pitter patter imma start it
A rap chance this tap dance to sing ‘bout this love
Want to shout it out loud mouth about dropped from sky above

I’m singing and tapping in the rain
Forgetting broken hearts and cold pain
Enjoying her warm heart and refrain
Just singing and tapping in the rain

[Tap Dance]

[?] feelings forgive me [?] temperament
Kathy [is prophetic] for the betterment
She’s ahead of it
She knows I’m in this lane
I could never be the same
'Cause she came into my life now I’m rapping in the rain
I’m singing
Forgetting broken hearts and cold pain
Enjoying her heart and refrain
And rapping in the rain
