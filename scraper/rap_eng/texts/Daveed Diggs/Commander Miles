Told you man the whole city getting weird (Haha)
The more of them pop up, the more of us disappear (Oh)
And the peer groups still dipping out, we ain't scared (Uh)
But we missin' though
Homeless out here just pissin' bro (tuh)
Camped out out front the liquor sto' (Uh)
But I keep wondering where all the liquor go (Ayy)
It's a coffee shop now (Shit)
Lattes and espressos
Hard problems out here, a lot of stuff we gotta wrestle with (Uh)

[Daveed Diggs]
It's a bit of a mental shift
Be careful on the scene though

[Rafael Casal]
City feelin' like a seesaw (Huh)
Can't believe all the kinda things that we saw (Ooh)
Shit I remember growing up, that was streets raw
Now all I see is paws and dogs (Haha)
Lil', pocket-sized purses (Yeah)
Bitches in 'em (Haha)
Carried by bitches, who ain't tryna catch the rhythm (Yo)
They want the balance but they don't want a motherfucker like me so they tryna get me up out they body like an exorcism
(Woo)
They can catch the vision

[Daveed Diggs]
This what the town used to be about
Pitbulls and shepherds (Uh)
Now it's about little dudes and littler sweaters (Haha)
All yellin' at 'em "Bro, get your shit together!(Haha)
You look like you ain't even trying, do better!" (Haha)
