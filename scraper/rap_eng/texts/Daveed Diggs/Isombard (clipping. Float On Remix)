[Intro: Daveed Diggs]
(What?)
(What? What?)
Float on, float on
(What?)
(What? What?)
Float on, float on

If you can't walk then run
Try to get across the bridge, boy don't jump
Smile for the camera, have you some fun
Pill popping 'til it take out the sun
Double cupping 'til the whole world go numb
Double cupping 'til the whole world go numb

[Daveed Diggs]
Na na na
Fuck up your funds
Money stacked so high, gank your ones
But it lean in heavy, stick out your tongue
Take this, it'll make you feel wonderful
Of the juice, he got none
Tell your man stop looking, them real guns

[Daveed Diggs]
Now now now
Get out the way, slime, (They shoot)
Fuck it it's time to paid, slime, (Stop moving)
They been turnt up four ways, slime, (You ruined)
They gon' get you some baseline
Come out it's play time
Riding around they getting it
Rim's low they stay high
Say "Hi" to God
That motherfucker ain't make time

[hook: Daveed Diggs]
This life is so, so fucking cold
Just try to float
(What?)
Na na na
Outside they bang, police with gangs
Just try to float
(Float on, float on) Na na na
(Why ain't you gettin' this huh?)
This life is so, so fucking cold
Just try to float
(Float on, float on) Na na na
They let you hang, despite your name
Just try to float
(Float on, float on) Na na na

[Daveed Diggs]
Squares guess, life's quick, lil' snitch, fuck what you heard
Only circles in your circle, the fuck up with these nerds?
Can't nobody get faded like you? That's absurd
All these motherfuckers out here slurring their words
The smoke rings, and that coke finger, that nose bleeding, that purge
That ice cloud, and these nights loud, and the pipes blazing that herb

[Daveed Diggs]
Keep it goinâ€™ until
You see the sun coming up
You hope they don't think you done
You're fearless, man, out for the fun
Looking for the love, you won't find none
Slow motion for the hope that she come
To the hotel, pop that like gum

[Daveed Diggs]
Now now now
Keep that count straight, slime (Don't lose it)
Oh, you thought the night was really going to wait, slime (They moving)
It's some pitbulls at the gate, slime (Be cool)
Either bite back or get ate, slime
Quit pillow talking on FaceTime
Riding around, they getting it
Only talking that baseline
Say goodbye to your life
Those motherfuckers erase time

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
This life is so, so fucking cold
Just try to float
Na na na
Outside they bang, police with gangs
Just try to float
Na na na
(Why ain't you gettin' this huh?)
This life is so, so fucking cold
Just try to float
(Float on, float on) Na na na
They let you hang despite your name
Just try to float
(Float on, float on) Na na na
