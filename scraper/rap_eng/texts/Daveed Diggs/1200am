[Intro]
The moral altitude of man is directly related to his aptitude for self-preservation
On the brink of a type 1 society, the question becomes
How effective is self-preservation against ourselves?
And what happens, when the foundations we've built crumble
And new heights are just out of reach

[Verse 1: Signor Benedick the Moor & Daveed Diggs]
Step one in a matrix: don't think that you could ever make shit
Cause shit'll make you and shit'll break you, but shit, you could never break shit
Step two: repeat step one, but this time like you mean it
It ain't no sweatin', no half-steppin', no analyzing yo' dream shit
Step three: never turn on the TV, Big Brother is watching with glee
In his eyes, on the prize and the price of your life and your lies are the things people believe till you die
Step four is get ready for the forgetting and forfeiting
Of everything you stand for, these are the demands and of course it's
Four horses in the form of the force is moving through space
Dragon in the sick quarters torches, look at the abyss through our portals

[Chorus: Signor Benedick the Moor (& Daveed Diggs)]
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
(everyone asleep, everyone asleep)
Virus in the code while there's niggas in the street
(niggas in the street, niggas in the street)
Loops in the system, can't nobody miss 'em
(can't nobody miss 'em, can't nobody miss 'em)
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
(everyone asleep)
Sleep tight my baby, there's no need for you to cry
Your life is laid out you live it till you die
If they tell you different you tell 'em to walk on by
Foolish pride

[Verse 2: Signor Benedick the Moor]
Pixelated pistols, computer-guided missiles
A rose of 40 thistles arose of 40 issues
Mamma grab the tissues, baby grab the iPad
Shawty say "I miss you", niggas say "oh, my bad"
Another bitch off the screen, sniffing blow, sipping lean
What the fuck do I mean? The matrix is make-believe
The matrix is make-believe, the matrix is make-believe
The matrix is make-believe

[Daveed Diggs]
Welcome to the world of make-believe and you can take your shoes off at the couch
Slip into some slippers, grab a cup of tea, inhale the steam into your mouth
Open up your senses, zone into the moment, that is what it's all about
Relax away your inhibition till you realize never was there any doubt

[Bridge: Signor Benedick the Moor]
I'm your mother, I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga in the alley
I'm your doctor when in need
Want some coke? Have some weed
You know me, I'm your friend
Your main boy, thick and thin
I'm your pusherman, I'm your pusherman

[Daveed Diggs]
One time for the pusherman, one time for the pusherman
Two times for the pusherman, two times for the pusherman

[Chorus: Signor Benedick the Moor]
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
Repeat all the same shit and I was knee deep, on the edge
Maybe you should leave, creepin' out, carry the screen, takin' a motherfuckin' seat
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
Virus in the code while there's niggas in the street
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
There's oops in the system, can't nobody miss 'em
But it really don't matter though 'cause everyone asleep
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
Everyone asleep
Calm me down homie, calm me down, calm me, calm me down
Everyone asleep

[Verse 3: Signor Benedick the Moor & Daveed Diggs]
Nothin', these niggas ain't nothin'
I'm [?] so why they all frontin'? Why they all frontin'?
They sittin' here, fuck it
[?]
I keep 'em on guessing and waiting, these niggas need anew lesson
So who need a new lesson?
Step one in a matrix: don't think that you could ever make shit
Cause shit'll make you and shit'll break you, but shit, you could never break shit
Step two: repeat step one, but this time like you mean it
It ain't no sweatin', no half-steppin', no analyzing yo' dream shit
