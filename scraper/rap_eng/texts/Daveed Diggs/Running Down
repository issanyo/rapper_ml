[HOOK]
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down, down, down

[VERSE 1]
If I’m tumbling down
Could I count on you
To tell me that
I can easily
Find an answer
That I’m bound to
But I just wanna be fly
Shouldn’t I have other cares?
Lookin’ at you in the sky
You give me nothing to run with
So I go down
And after a while, I love it

Others have died for you
Understand that I have tried for you
Prayed every day
And I ride for you
While other sons of yours lie to you
But to try to wear the crown’s
The only love I’ve ever known
So I keep on chasing frowns
I’m running down on my own, yeah

[HOOK]
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down, down, down

[VERSE 2]
I’m up in the sky
Punkin’ the clouds
Hunting for the one who brought me around
The ground I left
Had to be y’all
Cause people down there
Still passin’ their doubts
So run like I wanted to share ‘em with something
They scared of becoming someone out the norm
So they don’t like to see me
Not care and perform
There I’m war between the base and narrow the storm
The rain comes down like a metronome
When I’m left alone
Don’t fault my lines
Sometimes they creak when I get trombone
Get it? Blown
Get me a stone
Got quite a Goliath to triumph
Then I got a shot with the records I sling
I could be king
But once a giant
What if I’m too high and lose sight of things?

[HOOK]
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down, down, down

[VERSE 3: Daveed Diggs]
Metaphorically speakin’
The nine is cocked
Watching my life
Like the years of a clock
I’ve seen it all before
This footage is stock
Like chickens, we flip ‘em
The grandfather clock
Claws, paws
The pendulum’s stuck
Just right of the center
My rhetoric’s fucked
So I can say nothing
That isn’t considered legitimate
Listen, my n*gga, I’m just
A rapper, not Jesus
Why must I be this
Politically conservative beast
No homo, no love
Begging, blowin’-dro drug
With no reading, no reason
No pleasin’ nobody
I’m tired
Race like a demon ‘a speed
I be needing to take
Just to keep up
Me? I needing a break
The big one is coming
They tell me
I wait (It’s too late; we already)

[HOOK]
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down
Ya see me running
Ya see me running, running, running on
Down, down, down, down
(Ya) down, down, down, down, down
