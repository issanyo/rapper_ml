[HAMILTON]
Now I can write a revolutionary screed until my fingers bleed
But action’s gonna bring us what we need

[ENSEMBLE]
Yes indeed

[HAMILTON]
Tonight we plant a revolutionary seed
And watch it twist and weave and grow
Until we choke out every weed

[ENSEMBLE]
Yes indeed

[HAMILTON]
Let’s grab those cannons with our legendary speed
Keep in step with me, the leader of this gang, are we agreed?

[ENSEMBLE]
Yes indeed

[HAMILTON]
Stick with me

[ENSEMBLE]
Yes indeed

[HAMILTON]
Til we’re free

[ENSEMBLE]
Yes indeed

[HAMILTON]
Say goodbye to the life you used to lead

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
Ladies and gentlemen!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
The moment you’ve been waiting for!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
The pride of Mount Vernon!

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
George Washington!

[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

[ENSEMBLE]
What

[WASHINGTON]
Outmanned

[ENSEMBLE]
What

[WASHINGTON]
Outnumbered, outplanned

[ENSEMBLE]
Buck buck buck buck buck

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta make an all out stand
Hey yo, I’m gonna need a right hand man

[ENSEMBLE]
Buck buck buck buck buck

[WASHINGTON]
Can I be real a second? For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel second?
Now I’m the model of the modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin’ letters to relatives
Embellishin’ my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I’m leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look
We are outgunned

[ENSEMBLE]
What

[WASHINGTON]
Outmanned

[ENSEMBLE]
What

[WASHINGTON]
Outnumbered, outplanned

[ENSEMBLE]
Buck buck buck buck buck

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta make an all out stand
Hey yo, I’m gonna need a right hand man
