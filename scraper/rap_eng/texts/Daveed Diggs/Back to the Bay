[Intro]
Nestled in an enclave in Cali
Where demonstrations and rallies
Have a long history of making waves and tastes
Shaping language and style substantially
Standing for the best in the wake of the worst tides
We've seen in a long time
From a long line of lyricists, linguists, and yes, panthers
Not to mention regular people so inundated with game
That the slang rivaling Shakespeare seems common
As it should
Here where Gertrude Stein claimed there was no there
Has grown a scene which has newcomers clamoring to understand
And get a piece
And they holler at fever pitch
And confidently riding the crest of this epic sound wave is a team that in true Bay fashion redefined the rules of the game
And then made the new ruler undeniable
And as a new season begins we prepare to bring it back
Bring it back, back, back, back

[Chorus]
Back to the Bay
Finna bring another one back to the Bay
Show the whole game how to act in the Bay
Squad stacked in the Bay
You can hate but you can't ignore the facts in the Bay

[Verse]
Look the earth we stand on is Klay
And the turf we claim is carefully placed
On a strong foundation, a nation
And watch us paving away in amazement
And the sweat breaks out with a smile and a head shake
You can taste the spice
Chef Curry, cooking up look at em shook as they know their ankles may break
And they could rant all day
Got Durant comin' over to play
But real talk? Who wouldn't want to live in the Bay
Best place in the Golden State
Face the music, hyphie
But never lost the blues and the polka
The gospel of Matt Barnes
Yeah, we still believin'
Stand tall, stay centered
That JaVale McGee
But they key thing, no matter what their eyes seen
They can't see us, we dream in Draymond Green
Cooler than Pachulia's stare, we gets busy
But stay calm and drop bombs like Iggy
We way too Jiggy, we way too focused
You know this, from the O to the So' to the Valley Jo' to San Jo', this
Isn't metaphorical around here the town and the crowd gets
Call it Roaracle how loud is the town business
Loud enough to shut 'em down
Loud enough you feel it every time we come around
Loud enough to shake the ground and still keep 'em flocking to Oakland
Keep talkin' while we win another trophy

[Chorus]
Back to the Bay
Finna bring another one back to the Bay
Show the whole game how to act in the Bay
Squad stacked in the Bay
You can hate but you can't ignore the facts in the Bay
