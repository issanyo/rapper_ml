Daveed Diggs (singing): Rubber Duckie, you're the one
You make bath time lots of fun
Rubber Duckie, I'm awfully fond of you
Voh-do-do-de-o!
Rubber Duckie, joy of joys
When I squeeze you, you make noise
Rubber Duckie you're my very best friend, it's true
Daveed Diggs (Rapping): I got my Rubber Duckie
I'm in the tub with bubblies
He isn't very fuzzy
I know my Duckie loves me
Call up my homie, Ernie
The orange one, you heard me
Yeah, he is the best, and I am on a quest, to get him in here early
I need that duckie with me
I'll have a bath time it's a- gonna be iffy
If I don't see him, man, I won't be nifty
Oh, I'm just feeling dirty, so I guess I'm feeling wordy
Where's that duckie, man?
I need him here, right now, squeeze him, you heard me
Squeak!
Ernie (Singing): Rubber duckie I'm awfully fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooond of youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
