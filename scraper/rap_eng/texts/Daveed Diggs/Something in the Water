[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
There’s something in the water
And everything we spit wet
They keep telling me it’s something in the water
And I ‘em they ain’t really seen shit yet
It’s something in the water
Born bright but the light bent brilliant
Bay boys been above the wave
‘bout business and banks and straight off the building
I’m feeling myself
And numb to the rest
Dumb is a choice
When the world go blind and deaf
Got my ASL co-sign, thank you Maria
Never claimed a gang but it’s dope watching homies
Twist fingers when I pull up
Stylish, got my NY stylist
See me on TV in Comme de Garçons
Soon as it wrap I am back in my Warriors
Cap on a flight back home
And my home holler "go boy, get it, just please don’t forget us"
And I sandwich time tryna get this lettuce
Couldn’t stand with my grandmother Jessie
She took her last breath, I was on set doing hella extra

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Look at the desert we made
And everybody know its, nowhere else to go, so it’s home
Look at the desert we made
And can’t nobody see the way it used to be

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
It’s something in the water
And everything we think wet
They keep telling me it’s something in the water
And I tell ‘em they ain’t even had a drink yet
It’s something in the water
Swam out from a town that was drowning
Came back with a bucket and a bullhorn
And people act like I’m the only nigga shouting
The rush for the land is loud
And every other voice drowned out
People dog-paddle just to stay above it
While there’s new money laughing, yelling "who let the dogs out?"
And I bite vicious, but their chains tight
And the oak trees traded for shade from the high rise
And the eyes might not adjust to the new light hue
Swear it used to be a black town
Chinaka laid my career with those words
Her back is stronger than mine
Maybe she’ll give our city the height it deserves
I am just a wrecking light now
Honestly, it’s too much on me, I can’t see the road up ahead
Homies say I should buy Cartiers
But they won’t keep the salt out, think I should get goggles instead

[Hook: Daveed Diggs]
Look at the desert we made
And everybody knows it, nowhere else to go, so it’s home
Look at the desert we made
And can’t nobody see the way it used to be

[Interlude: Daveed Diggs + Emmy Raver-Lampman]
Look at the desert we made
And everybody knows it, nowhere else to go, so it’s home
Look at the desert we made
And can’t nobody see the way it used to be

[Verse: Daveed]
So they keep saying
It’s something in the water
And everything we own wet
They keep telling me it’s something in the water
I can tell that they are gearing up to go get a piece
Lakeshore or the Bottoms
Uptown Temescal and the problem is
Half of these neighborhoods didn’t exist before
You felt a drip and got thirsty there’s something in the water

[Interlude: Daveed Diggs + Emmy Raver-Lampman]
Look at the desert we made
Where money sucks everything dry
Where culture is liquid and currently in short supply
Where what we once called a community suddenly gets monetized
And once again soil is tilled on our backs
Just when we thought we were out
When picking cotton becomes cottonmouth
Look at the desert they called it a drought but

[Daveed]
There’s something in the water
And everybody wanna taste
Rolled in on the high tide
And now the sandcastle’s erased
There’s something in the water
And the well’s dried up
But we at the function double cupping like we don’t give a fuck
And there’s something in the water

[Outro]
Look at the desert we made
And everybody knows it, nowhere else to go
So it’s home
