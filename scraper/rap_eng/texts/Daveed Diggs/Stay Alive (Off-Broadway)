[ELIZA]
Stay alive…

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay alive…

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen his Excellency so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.”
I shoot back, "We have resorted to eating our horses."
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalry’s not coming

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
That’s right

[WASHINGTON]
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

[WASHINGTON]
Outrun

[HAMILTON]
Outrun

[WASHINGTON]
Outlast

[HAMILTON]
Outlast

[WASHINGTON]
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast

[HAMILTON]
Chick-a-plast!

[WASHINGTON]
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]
Raise a glass

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day’s a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev’ry day
“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
And ev’ry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand
