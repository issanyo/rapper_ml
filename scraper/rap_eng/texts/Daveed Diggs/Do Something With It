[Chorus]
We been held back from the beginning
System organized to keep us from winning
You can recognize a moment when you're in it
I'm in it and I'm tryna do something with it

Do something with it
Do something with it
Do something with it
Do something with it

Nothing was given to us so we gon' go get it
Winning don't matter if you don't do something with it

[Verse 1]
Let's not be confused about the plan:
They tried to say that I was three fifths of a man
And at least that was an amount
They tried to tell us that a woman didn't count
So why we act surprised by the stacked deck?
We pay for every step: blood, sweat, snapped necks
Mama used to rock a snapback with the X
I didn't get it at the time, I hadn't read his text
He said "By any means," and me, I misunderstood
Sick of being ignored, we wallowin'[?] out in the hood
And I respect it if you venting your rage
But I'ma focus now on trying a change

[Chorus]
We been held back from the beginning
System organized to keep us from winning
You can tell a moment when you're in it
I'm in it and I'm tryna do something with it
