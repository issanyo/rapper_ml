[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Gods
Flesh is hanging in sun
Purple sky and this war
Women shooting their guns
Men protecting their shores
Running red as these ships
Made for cargo and death
Is a taste on the lips
Kissing any ground left
To the sky with them all
Not a one left on land
Traded in for steel hauls
And they singing like:

[Hook: Choir]
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid-

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Three siblings happen to be gods
And they fight as siblings do
The world was only water then
The universe was fresh and new
Enefa poisoned Bumbaâ€™s food
Wants just to see what he would do
He vomited the sun which dried
The water leaving land and soon
After came Moon and stars and animal
And man of many hues
The white one in the image of
A sickly god would get his dues

[Hook: Choir]
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid to-

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Man walks Moon and he makes time come to a standstill
One gloved hand, diamonds are flickering like candles
This one slip, registered worlds away in vandals
Raised to find this race of beings that could handle
Time inside other bodies so they could sell it
The one thing in the universe no one held yet
Gifts in blood that had been shed as long as time had
Time and he are inseparable in his mind, sad
He must carry the burden of being the one
That time chose, situates him in front of the gun
Talk that talk, stay outta the head and become the best
When times stops, then for him finally there can be rest

[Hook: Choir]
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid to die
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
True believer, I know when I'm goin' home
I've been afraid to die

[Bridge: Paul Outlaw]
Been afraid to die
Been afraid to die
Been afraid to die
I've been afraid to die
I've been afraid to die
I've been afraid to die

[Outro: Voice synthesizer]
Pale gods told me to my face
O yes, Lord
The place I seek I never find
O yes, Lord
True believer, I know when we going home
True believer, I know when we going home
True believer, I know when we going home
I've been afraid
