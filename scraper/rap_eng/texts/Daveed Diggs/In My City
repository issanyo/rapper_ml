[Mistah F.A.B.]
Ooh yeah (Mistah F.A.B.)
Party like it's 1999
Who is shawty, cause she mighty fine
Her friend is ugly, she is not a dime
Shots fired, Columbine
Ooh, I'm sorry, please forgive me
Keep it under like Sydney
Tryna to shove it in her kidney
She get higher than Whitney
Fastrak, watch her speed through
Like to drink, smoke weed, too?
Hard to kill like T2
Ice cold, I'm a igloo
I got the city on fire
[?] gon' keep it lit
Ask the streets, I'm no liar
They gon' say [?]

I'm from the city of Oakland, I'm from the city of trees (ya ya)
I'm from the city of gangsters, I'm from the city of thieves (ya ya)
I'm from the city of pimps, I'm from the city of players (ya ya)
I'm the man in my city, in my city, I'm the mayor
I'm from the city of game, I'm from the city of paper
I'm from the city of Warriors, I'm from the city of Raiders
I'm from the city of Short, I'm from the city of Hammer
Oakland, California, we the West Coast Atlanta

[Interlude]
Where you from, where you from?
Better scream out your city!
Where I'm from, where I'm from we go dumb
Yeah, dumber than Diddy
Havin' fun, hella fun
Come and get busy
But just know that we don't play that

[Hook]
In my city
We don't play that in my city (in my city)
We don't play that in my city (in my city)
We don't play that in my city (in my city)
Know that we don't play that

Rest In Peace to the God
