[Intro]
Stab him in the throat

[Verse 1]
Tryna turn it into something (tryna turn it into something)
What the fuck he been discussin’?
He looking schwifty, man you shouldn’t trust him
That sucker’s schwifty, man you shouldn’t trust him
Only came to show out, so the wrist is lit
Step up in the club, if the bitch is thick
Bouncer know the clique, so they get in quick
Hopped up out the whip, same color Pickle Rick
All up in the function with the blammer tucked (blammer tucked)
Bouncer is a factor, better dap him up (dap him up)
Slide a couple green ones and he backin’ up
Shawty bad as fuck and wetter than an aqueduct
So she walked in free too, then that jaw-jackin’ ol’ motherfucka come up actin’ a fool
Put his big hand on her big ass without checkin’ if it was cool
She looked him dead in his eyeball and said, “You got til the count of two”

[Chorus]
That man gon’ end up dead (dead, dead)
He bumpin’ his flappy folds to the feds (feds, feds)
Plus she a hitter, he don't know (know)
He got caught slippin’ and she stab him in the throat (throat)
He outta pocket, you should stab him in the throat (throat)
He keep on talkin’, you should stab him in the throat (throat)
He stuntin’ like he hard but he ain’t trained to go
If he ain’t solid gonna stab him in the throat (throat)

[Verse 2]
This one turnin’ into something (this one turnin’ into something)
What the fuck he been discussin’?
He lookin’ schwifty, man you shouldn’t trust him
That sucker’s schwifty, man go on ahead and bust him
That’s why you keep the pepper close
That habanero have him leakin’ Szechuan right there on the floor
That’s why she always plan to have a knife, the club is goin’ hammer right
The chopper got no manners, certain standards that a man abides
An eye is for an eye and so the crime can match the punishment
He out there sayin’ every line so she gonna take his tongue from him
That way this canary won’t be singin’ much (won’t be singin’ much)
He bleedin’ out, you hear the bubbles when he breathe and stuff
That’s what happens when the paper trail is too long
Go through his pockets, text him family on his new phone
So they can figure what to say up on his tombstone
And that’s the way the news goes

[Beat breakdown]

[Chorus]
That man gon’ end up dead (dead, dead)
He bumpin’ his flappy folds to the feds (feds, feds)
Plus she a hitter, he don't know (know)
He got caught slippin’ and she stab him in the throat (throat)
He outta pocket, you should stab him in the throat (throat)
He keep on talkin’, you should stab him in the throat (throat)
He stuntin’ like he hard but he ain’t trained to go
If he ain’t solid gonna and stab him in the throat (throat)

[Outro]
Stab him in the throat
Stab him in the throat
Gon’ stab him in the throat
Stab him in the throat
