It's all in the water now, wash
Sin sticks to the skin quick
Round here to keep the skin thick
Cause if that shit reach the vein, then it's toxic
Tock, tick, tock tick
Tickle me pink, riddle me this
How do you fill a cliche with a middle finger and kiss it as a promise?
I'm on this rock 24 years now
Seen rain fall, puddle into pools
Yes I'm
Following, focusing on one drip
Maybe a quick slip of the tongue
Flipping it till this your own shit
See, round here, nobody owns shit
So if you own this statement it makes your vision a stone wit
Every bit as much matter as the bone or the gristle or that muscle hustle for that fatty tissue
Is you is or is you ain't ready?
Personally it's hurting me to be fed up with fetty for sure
Dedicated to know the weight of a teardrop
Here, stop for a minute
Catch your breath, breathe deep
We got time
Matter of fact, that's all we got left
Minus the breath and rhyme reside and the treble clef
Who's the deafest?
Fuck it
Who's the definition of it?
Fuck it
What are we defining?
Fuck, I was fine before I started thinking
Grandma was fine before she started drinking
I saw the sign and then I started blinking
Fell off the line and now I'm on the brink
I've lost the stink and Mapquest doesn't match my destination
Smash chest before a manly ritual
Damnit, I'm a fucking rap star
The social conscience only slaps cars about as much as insecurity
Don't tell me how to do my job man, I do it well
Just tell me what I need to do to make my record sell
Don't sell me on no magic, cause I don't believe in spells
I'll see y'all rappers and politicians in hell
It's all in the water now, wash
It's all in the water now, wash
It's all in the water now, wash
