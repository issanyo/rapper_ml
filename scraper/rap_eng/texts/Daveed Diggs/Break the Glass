[Verse 1]
It's too cold, be cool, ice cold
Kill up a few more, or let 'em be cool
So why don't you just speak on it?
These fools, they froze, but this g's lonely here
And gotta be working for... oh, whatever
Why the fuck you wait on the coats for?
The life binary in Morse code
Ain't really a life, right?
It hurt though, it feel like a voodoo curse
So you scream every so often to break up the monotony
You feel me? No, fuck your feeling
A real motherfucker here is tryna fuck for real
Like something's here but fuck it though
He ain't gon' feel for a while, he ain't been real for a while
So it gon' kill you to smile? So it gon' kill you to die?
Or do you just stop?

[Verse 2]
Shit maybe, you don't even know that shit crazy
Be OG and go, and get away
See, you already know they can't hate if they don't ever wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Please wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
I'm so tired of bein' alone, I'm so tired of goin' home
Won't you help me, won't you help me?
This ain't healthy to be held to blame
Once you help me, now you abandon me
What you're tellin' me by not tellin' me?
Anything, anything
I'd give anything if you'd say my name
Don't you play with me, it's an emergency

[Hook]
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
Time to break the glass
