Skitzo
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Simmer
You might just wanna simmer
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Before I go
Skitzo

[Verse 1]
I’m just a hippies’ baby
Born about the eighties
The Boomers' juniors sucking psychedelics out their hooters
Must have been in their milk
Peace-loving tripping balls
Had us growing up different
Yup, limpin' up and down them halls
Heard I came out with a blunt in my mouth
And a lean to the left
And a clean little cleft in my chin
Felt like it fell in
Built like it built in
Built up to a meagre million
Got a fixation on tryna fix fake shit
Room full of lies, club full of fake tits
Mother loved p-funk
Daddy was gang shit
So I was born on a low ride space ship
Out here promoting love
With a pistol on me so what?
When 'em hoodie’s up won’t catch me slipping pimping best of luck
Busboy brilliant, stockroom ratchet
Pushing a pack of the pills fast, shit
Just trying to come up on an extra buck
Had a couple bad ones baffling anyone who be wonderin' what the women I be lovin' look like
Strippers, skaters, painters, PhD-candidates and celebrity lookalikes
PETA demonstrators, pickets protests so left so sweet so blessed
Ah yes, so somebody say something outta pocket
Why you gotta talk shit
Watch it

[Pre-Chorus]
I got what they wanting
‘Cause I change it up so often
Skitzo
Feel so Guns N’ Roses
I could love them or could off them

[Chorus]
Skitzo
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Simmer
You might just wanna simmer
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Before I go
Skitzo

[Verse 2]
I’m happy
I’m feeling glad
I got some papers, grapes and songs I made and they all in my bag
Got the roaches fumigated but face it they common as crack
They just like haters, you could smoke them but they crawling on back
I know ‘cause I was raised to see faking
Had the eighties never seen Reagan
Wouldn’t be no fiends hanging on my street begging
Yup, crack era babies lie to my partners need training
But I can’t blame mo'ney
Get money made slanging
Might as well keep banging
Got no filter, God I’m lost, gassin' like the Holocaust
Womanizer, dick supplier, my cocktails are Molotov
Mugging at the next dude
While helping mama with her bags
Tryna avoid the drama but what the fuck is he looking at?
Mafioso get so loco
Ma stronzo, sui giote
No la lengua
That’s what they all be pledging on my lines
Like they fucking betas
Hey, can’t we all be friends?
No?
Well get the fuck up out my way then

[Pre-Chorus]
I got what they wanting
‘cause I change it up so often
Skitzo
Feel so Guns N’ Roses
I could love them or could off them

[Chorus]
Skitzo
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Simmer
You might just wanna simmer
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Before I go
Skitzo

[Pre-Chorus: Rafael Casal & Daveed Diggs]
Whoa, whoa, wait up, wait up, wait up, wait wait
Is that that motherfucking Diggs over there?
Hey, yo Diggs Imma need you
Yeah
Good

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Look I’m just a baby hippie
Thug so what I got a pistol with me
Put it at your temple, pray my fingers ain’t feeling too slippery
Ever since he was grinchin', guess that made me the Lorax
Sadly, lifted away one day ‘til we met up in Whoville to make more tracks
A pastor preaching sin, eating peaches for hours
Then I fuck her face off, patiently layin' her up on a bed of flowers
And you can count the ways it’s wrong
But shit I’m only rapping
Mindlessly babbling
The greatest statements that have ever happened
Both knees walk in this line, paranoid as fuck, terrified as shit
In the back of our mind we know someone be coming for every motherfucker who’ll be on that real spit
Tryna tell me Pac and B.I.G. weren't skitzo man the fuck you talking
The direct effects is Dear Mama and All About U bumping on the same Walkman
But they don’t remember that post-digital, post-critical, post-race, post post modern
Post [?] post like posing for a picture we'll be catching up in post production
This how we function as a modern myth for your consumption
Got the subs up in your trunk bumping like I’m a personality descending from on top of the hood jumping

[Pre-Chorus]
I got what they wanting
‘cause I change it up so often
Feel so Guns N’ Roses
I could love them or could off them

[Chorus]
Skitzo
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Simmer
You might just wanna simmer
Simmer
I think you need to simmer
Before I go
