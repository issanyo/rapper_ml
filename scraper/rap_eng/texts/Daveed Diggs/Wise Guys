Movin’ up the ladder, movin’ up the ladder
Movin’ up the, movin’ up the, movin’ up the ladder

Movin’ up the ladder, movin’ up the ladder
Movin’ up the, movin’ up the, movin’ up the ladder

[VERSE 1]
I’m just searchin’ for love
Mama, give me a hug
I want to be the closest thing to you
If none above
I also want to be free to go be me at the club
But I don’t like payin’
So see me where we frequents be plucked
Line is out the door
Beam me to the bar
My spaceship is loaded up
But I cloaked it as a car
I’m just some okey-doke
But I am cloaked up as a star
While I’m sittin’ in a Saturn
Pretendin’ that it was Mars

Yeah, I need my space
In this universe
Wearin’ this uniform
Of a rapper from this Earth
Breathin’ and emceeing
While exhalin’ Van Halen
Puttin’ chains around my woman
So she knows that she comes first
She ain’t my possession
But she want me to seem close
So she’s wearin’ what I’m wearin’
So people know that we dos
Two birds of a feather
Fly far together
Shittin’ on you from above
When we flyin’ by in Coach

Teach me, train me
Tell me to roll over, but
If you think I’m bitch
Watch how quick I kill my owner
Oh, the leash don’t hold me
Bite the hand that feed me
If it taste like poison
I ain’t no pony
I don’t give free rides
Only Billie Jeans I’ve ever known
Were some Levis
All the enemies I’ve overthrown
Got to think twice
Never made it back to my throne
When they revise
Who the fuck are these guys

Movin’ up the ladder, movin’ up the ladder

[VERSE 2]
But if I was gone
The haters would have won
And new haters
They get made
Every occassion I perform
The stage can’t support much bullshit
It might break and purr everyone shoe
Thirty faker pourin’
So I call up Lauren
“Could you get the girls
And meet me for a band meetin’
At the center of the world
Where we could trim some hedges
And rethink the way it twirls
Cause I’m not gettin’ the spins I want
And these just make me hurl”

The globe is the carnival
I am the ferris wheel
Thinkin’ that I’m Bueller
Just tryin’ to get through the carousel
But it’s nothin’ new
Just a sideshow full of clowns
Claimin’ they are ghostin’
When they know they’re headed underground

Dead man walkin’
Blind man riot
Deaf man rappin’
If his mind get quiet
Death is an adventure
Guessin’ I’m gon’ like it
So when I’m out of breath
Bet that I’m gon’ try it

(Who the fuck are these guys?)
Movin’ up the ladder, movin’ up the ladder
Movin’ up the, movin’ up the, movin’ up the ladder
(Who the fuck are these guys?)
Movin’ up the ladder, movin’ up the ladder
Movin’ up the, movin’ up the, movin’ up the ladder

[VERSE 3: Daveed Diggs]
There he is on my
TV, here am I
Eating my cereal
In my boxers and a tie
Just the result of my
Psychotic uni
In unison producin’
This confusion that is I
Why not
I be strapped to the sky
Polyglot plot to
Lessen the space between my
Self and the top
Where they drop from
Hard to make a splash
When you droppin’ from the bottom rung

Got ‘em from the Bottoms to the Commons
With a pollen tongue
Pollinate the game
But they don’t smell me
Where I’m fallin’ from
Fallin’ in, ballin’ men
All fall down
Harder than all of them
All call town
Home, homie
Here’s where I reside
But they don’t know me
Apparently, I’m hiding
So I go
Over the top
Listen, when I’m rhyming
And my clothes
Bright as fuck
I bet I get a sighting

And that shit help my views on the YouTube
Usin’ it to boost my illusion and my crew’s too
Sue me for the lies
But peruse me with your eyes, fool
Hopin’ to be known for what I am before I die
I’m
