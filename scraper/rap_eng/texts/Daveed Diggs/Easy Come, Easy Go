[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Yeah, everybody tryna be a boss, not me (yeah)
I don't need no muhfuckin' employee (yeah, yeah)
A one-man, rubber band stand
Rockin' beast on a beat like a cop on a street
But I'm not no Johnny Law
Johnny Walker to the jaw
Talk a broad up out her bra
Brought her back behind the bar, better back up, bruh
I'm broader than Barrington
When the levee break you need a vest
Best leave me alone lest I divest you of your life, but I digress
I buy Red Stripe, I eye tigress, ice bag a'ight
Aye aye, captain, I'm first to mate
You sloppy seconds, get a plate
I play the part of party rocker well, I paint it like a Rockwell
I rock a welfare line like I was headlinin' at Rock the Bells
Raisin' up the bar these jumpers is far below
They want a rockstar, why you playin' Guitar Hero?
They wanted 'Pac, y'all brought a hologram, man, neato
But unless he back for real
I don't see no rapper hard as me though
And there ain't no reason why you all gettin' so Pacino
When I'm countin' my dinero, leaning Lennon, that's a Beatle
Or a revolutionary, red like the blood on my block I bleed
And I walk like crip and I talk like Pimp
And I rock like Rick and I got my keys in the lock like
Keys to a rock, I'm a flip my talk
And I take my time and I take they dimes
And I make they minds irate and I write
And I wait for the rest of the world to find my pace
And I pace in the room, need space like the moon
All these fake cartoons, get up out my face, get up off my case
'Cause I ain't seen a box yet I can't break, bitch

[Hook: Daveed Diggs & Rafael Casal]
It's like they really tryna see me though
I don't know what the fuck they want to see me fo'
This rapping shit is easy come and easy go
This rapping shit is easy come and easy go
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(I put it down in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)

[Verse 2: Rafael Casal]
Everybody wanna be a CEO
I'm your only hope, sorry to be so 3PO
Oh, you ain't vibin' with me? Fine, bye bye and delete me, hoe
But I might fly by on your TV while you tweet up another reason
Nobody believin' in all the work you puttin' in
Or how you deserve a look or how everybody's sleepin' on ya
Or how you're better than everyone you know livin' in your area
But still stare and glare at the next motherfucker
Fallin' all up in your feelings
Now you better go and get all that in check, motherfucker
No respect for a sucka
Rub a bit o' Robitussin on your neck, motherfucker
Yo shit rock, Chris Rock, get that shit snatched by this brick top
Kick thick rocks, we big stoned, this old henge is a peak blinder
My whole clique in this pink binder
We paid to act, you still freestylers
Don't fuck with that kind and don't pay them no mind
And don't know them, no co-sign, no card at the cookout
No call when the commas are kickin', we boppin'
You slide in the DM, we leave it on read
While we giggin', we in our position
We Cuarenta sippinâ€™, that's our demolition
We hittin' up 40, he says. "Y'all gotta stunt harder"
Don't go big then why bother?
So it's bang bang with the Bay slang, let it spray like AK
Then quick put up a hand like I'm Dave Blaine
That's game in the land of the pimp game, hats better tip, man
My OGs have double O'd, we the OGs now
We don't let no one pull our card now, we deal those things out
Even when the chips are down, I will bet big on this crown
See royalty is about loyalty and boy, are we down
Oh boy, are we down why would we come fuck with you now?
Hit you when we need it, help wit' missin' pieces we found
Oh, it's funny how your frontin' put you right in the back
Say it's a movie, this a movie man, how funny is that?
Bitch!

[Hook: Daveed Diggs & Rafael Casal]
It's like they really tryna see me though
I don't know what the fuck they want to see me fo'
This rapping shit is easy come and easy go
This rapping shit is easy come and easy go
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(I put it down in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)
Easy come, easy go, easy come, easy go
(You know the town in this motherfucker)
