[BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[JEFFERSON]
Ev’ry action has an equal, opposite reaction
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab’net’s fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we’re breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don’t print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in
This bitch is askin’ for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this asshole so we can at last unmask him
I’ll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While no one watching, he got Washington in his pocket

[JEFFERSON AND BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
You're never invisible
You're never denied
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[MADISON]
I used to write with him, imbibe with him, and ride with him
I find myself on this side of a sizable divide with him
Now set your sights on a scenario where every Hamiltonian plan is implemented
That's where we're headed
He’s doubled the size of the government
Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size
And taxes? Yet he acts as if he has exclusive access to the facts
But the fact is we can't relax
He likes taxes so much; can we enact an asshole tax?

[JEFFERSON AND BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
Look back at the Bill of Rights

[MADISON]
Which I wrote

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
The ink hasn’t dried
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[JEFFERSON]
Let’s follow the money and see where it goes

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON]
Because every second the Treasury grows

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON]
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamilton’s misdeeds

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON]
This immigrant isn’t somebody we chose

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON]
This immigrant’s keeping us all on our toes

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON]
Let’s lower his stock in the eyes of the nation
With misinformation!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
First we diminish him
Then we finish him

[JEFFERSON]
He wants to reinstall the king!

[MADISON]
He's secretly getting it done!

[A WOMAN]
I hear he's George Washington's

[TWO WOMEN]
Illegitimate son

[A MAN]
We don't know where he's really from

[ANOTHER MAN]
We have to stop him soon

[HAMILTON]
They're saying my mother's a negress

[COMPANY]
I hear he's an octoroon

[ANOTHER WOMAN]
He wants to confiscate your property

[YET ANOTHER MAN]
What will you do?

[YET ANOTHER WOMAN]
He wants to abolish slavery

[MADISON]
That one's actually true!

[COMPANY]
No!

[MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON]
They'll follow his money and follow it through

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON]
Now follow his followers and see what they do

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON]
Let’s show these Federalists who they’re up against!

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Southern motherfuckin’—

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Democratic-Republicans!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
And if you begin to feel pity and shame

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Remember that Hamilton's doing the same

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
He's digging for dirt, he's looking for every time we lie

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Everybody's got something to hide!

It must be nice. It must be nice

[MADISON]
Follow the money and see where it goes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
It must be nice. It must be nice

[JEFFERSON]
The emperor has no clothes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Washington knocks us down, we take it in stride
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
