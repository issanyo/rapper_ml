[Intro]
Our mothers were pregnant African women thrown overboard while crossing the Atlantic Ocean on slave ships. We were born breathing water as we did in the womb. We built our home on the sea floor, unaware of the two-legged surface dwellers until their world came to destroy ours. With cannons, they searched for oil beneath our cities. Their greed and recklessness forced our uprising. Tonight, we remember

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember how deep it go
Started from the bottom
Y'all remember how deep it go
'Fore y'all had to come back, deep
Y'all remember when it used to be deep
So deep, so, so deep, ayy
When y'all swim up out yo' mama while y'all mama was asleep
So deep, so, so deep, ayy
And y'all remember when y'all had the dance floor lit, dark
No two-step, deep, y'all don't even sweat, deep
As deep as it gets
Dreaming dead asleep and keeping time
Y'all heartbeat, deep, y'all heartbeat, deep
And all the fishes had they eyes bugged out
Cause y'all dancing underwater and y'all don't get wet
And the dark smelled sweet and y'all tails touch reef
Y'all feed off the bottom, but now y'all remember

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember
Y'all remember

[Interlude 1]
Pressure outside the vehicle: 832.2 bars

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember when the deep got hot when y'all move on up
How y'all used to argue 'bout the water getting warmer
Still y'all loved a little bit of light up in the deep
So deep, so, so deep, ayy
Y'all remember saying how it couldn't be them two legs
Cause y'all came from two legs
And y'all mamas would've loved y'all if they could've breathed
But they wasn't ready for the deep
So deep, so, so deep, ayy
Y'all remember when the first blast came
And the beat fell off and the dreams got woke
And the light bent bad and the fishes belly up
And them coral castles crumbled 'cause they wasn't quite enough
And conversation used to break like the floor quake
Like the bleached bones and the fin friends fled from they home
But the blasts wouldn't stop 'cause they wanted black gold
And them no-gills had to feel it 'cause they couldn't be told

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember
Y'all remember

[Interlude 2]
Ocean salinity: 35 PSU. Water pH: 7.91

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember when the regime changed
That no pleas, no calm seas, let the water rise
So deep, so, so deep
Oil slick upon the sleeper was an awful thing to realize
If the two legs wanna wake the dead
They gon' have to bring more fire, y'all is closer to the earth
So deep and y'all was talking how to get up in they heads
And got to bein' real inspired circumstances of the birth
Has got y'all feeling like an army, better yet a navy
And they gone gave y'all the blessing now y'all going crazy
They live with green up on the surface but they ain't deep
That pistol shrimp could knock a two leg off his feet
Y'all perfecting the steam void to rip up they ships
They using sonar as second language, y'all fluent with it
And all the dreamers is woke now, but nightmares swim
But everybody hear that "bloop" know y'all coming for them

[Chorus: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember
Y'all remember

[Interlude 3]
Surface water temperature: 308 Kelvin

[Verse 4: Daveed Diggs]
Y'all remember when the call went out, ayy
No deep, no more deep, sunshine
Y'all remember when the call went out, ayy
No deep, no more deep, sunshine
Y'all remember feeling wind up on your skin
No deep, no more deep, sunshine
Y'all remember how it burned in the beginning
No deep, ride on 'em, ride on 'em, ride on 'em
Y'all remember seeing sun across the surface on the day that y'all first came up out the water, so, so deep
How the breaking of the surface showed the sky without a border and the air is so much hotter, so, so deep
How the woke dreamer screamed and it rose tides
And the waves stretched up like a mountain high
And the no gills gasp and they closed eyes
And they pray to they gods and they ask why
And then y'all cry too 'cause y'all recognize mama in the faces of the ones that y'all were terrorized
They were sisters and brothers, they were the babies born up out the water
Not connected to each other
Not in knowledge of the one drop
But they had to learn today
Y'all had one shot, let the sun burn today
Let them feel the dark even deeper today
Make a two leg a believer today
Let them know that they done woke a sleeper from a sleep, so deep
That y'all been dancin' without any feet, so, so deep
Here's the nerve that they struck with a blast
That they broke with a drill, that they burnt with the gas
Y'all remember, so deep, sunshine, ride on 'em
Y'all remember, so deep, sunshine, ride on 'em
Y'all remember, so deep, sunshine, ride on 'em
Y'all remember when y'all had to let 'em breathe
Ride on 'em, ayy
