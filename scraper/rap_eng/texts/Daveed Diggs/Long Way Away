[Chorus]
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
And I'm all alone
Along, along a long way

[Verse]
There's no use in crying
No reason to wait (Long way away)
We'll not again meet
'Cause the distance is great (Long way away)
But look to the stars
Where the sun is long gone (Long way away)
And pray that your children
Do not sing this song

[Chorus]
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
And I'm all alone
Along, along a long way

[Chorus]
It's a long way away
It's a long way away
And I'm all alone
Along, along a long way

[Outro]
