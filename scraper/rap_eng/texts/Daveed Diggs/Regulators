[Hook 1: Rafael Casal]
Can I choose how I live?
Kind of car I should whip?
Kind of job I should get?
Yeah, man I call bullshit
Oh no, you regulators
We the new regulators (yeah)

Can I choose how I live?
Kind of car I should whip?
Kind of job I should get?
Oh no, you regulators
We the new regulators (oh no, no)

[Verse 1: Rafael Casal]
All your new shit sound the same
Guess, now we all do cocaine
Long hair, don't care, guess I'm Cobain
Ain't gonna be no fucking gain if there's no pain
Okay, cut it open, grind it up
Spread it, pack it, roll it, load it up
I just need my potion in here
And then kill 'er well, kill 'er well, kill'er well
Uh, arigatou
Sunglasses look like I got me your [?]
Attitude look like I'm snatchin' your ho
Mentality far too advanced for that though
Oh, got my own [?] you can visit
Used to be on Henny now we just Jamison it
Rockin' like a motherfucker, I ain't got no limit
I'm a headbanger, boy, get wit it

[Verse 2: Daveed Diggs]
Codeine, codeine, yeah we need that
Double cup everywhere that we be at
Ain't tryin' to feel nothin' but these raps
Y'all sleep, can't breathe, get a C-PAP
Pssh, that's that shit
Whatever you want bruh, pass that shit
They playin' my song bruh, slap that shit
I look like I'm all a fact of fiction
Diction too good when I ain't lit
So I stay lit but can't say the same shit
E'ryone else sayin' the game, spit flame in the ear
She at home playin' wit her clit
Y'all made the blueprint too basic
Then regulated the way we can make it
Bay Boys been busy setting fire to fake shit
Up in the crucible, meltin' this heavy metal
Been bettin' against this forever
Bitchin' it's time to settle
