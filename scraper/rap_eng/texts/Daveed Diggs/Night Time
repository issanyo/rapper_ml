[Hook]
Work all day ‘till my feet get sore
Keep on working ‘till the whistle blow
Oh, when the night time come
It’s on when the night time come
Wear this mask on my face all day
Smiling like I’m loving doing what you say
Oh, but 'till the night time come
It’s on when the night time come

So pops drives a bus for fifteen years, right
It’s at the very least the obvious cause of his tendinitis
The thinning of the hair, allergies to common fare
Contribute to the development of his cold stare
(Gangsta) Gentlemen, (listen up)
Ladies and transgressors
I appreciate the offers of all your subversive efforts
But to alleviate the scoffers and haters and other jesters
I'mma relegate myself to the more obvious F-words
Fuck this job, fuck my boss, fuck your finance
I give a fuck about these motherfuckers when I dance, so
Friday night I cut a rug like I’m weaving it
Staring at the clock waiting for five in the evening, shit
I’m leaving it immediately till Monday comes
Errybody meet me I see ya fiending to feel bass drums
We can unleash all these beasts building from biting they tongues
Take to the streets twerking on freedom and a little bit drunk
And singing...

[Hook]
Work all day ‘till my feet get sore
Keep on working ‘till the whistle blow
Oh, when the night time come
It’s on when the night time come
Wear this mask on my face all day
Smiling like I’m loving doing what you say
Oh, but till the night time come
It’s on when the night time come

Suit it up (yup)
Who the flyest (you?)
Me I’m biased (true)
But really ain’t nobody stepping out fresh as I is (okay)
Call me Osiris (yup)
King of the living dead (right)
I been a ghost for five days now I’m reanimated (come on)
And it’s a shame
To waste so much of myself on the game
With no clear winner or empirical reason to play
Me, I’m a player
Who doesn’t have a prayer
Shielding my eyes occasionally to escape the glare
Cause that man in the mirror look filthy
I don’t really know him but I know he tryna kill me
I am not his skin so he always tryna peel me
But having him in my heart makes my warm blood chilly, feel me?
Fuck it, I’m American working class split persona
Party like a rockstar, introverted loner
Cubicle complacent but wait 'till I get on
You gon’ see a monster walking out the front door of his home
Singing...

[Hook]
Work all day ‘till my feet get sore (feet get sore)
Keep on working ‘till the whistle blow ('till that whistle blow)
Oh, when the night time come (when it coming)
It’s on when the night time come
Wear this mask on my face all day
Smiling like I’m loving doing what you say
Oh, but till the night time come
It’s on when the night time come

Ain’t really over it has just begun
We gonna be alright when the night time come
I don’t wanna think about where you from
I just wanna see your face when the night time come
Tired of tryna figure out what I might become
I just wanna sing my song when the night time come
Please don’t ask me 'bout all the songs I’ve sung
I’m just trying to get by till the night time come

[Outro: Frank from Men In Black]
You humans, when are you gonna learn that size doesn’t matter? Just cause something’s important doesn’t mean it’s not very very small
How small?
Tiny. Like the size of a marble or a jewel
