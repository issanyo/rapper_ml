[Intro]

[Daveed Diggs]
Breath of fresh air from a fairly fresh place
Fresh jeans, fresh kicks, and a fresh face
Old school to these freshmen and it tastes fresh squeezed to these morning streets I be OJ

On BART listening to MP3's of these other MC's trying to figure how I'm different than
Better than, Flip it then
Let me be explicit and say "fuck you" anybody that ain't Get Back specific

Not to be a hater but I feel like something greater than
Aligator face away from the game that I'm playing in
Bass-hits for these base-wits in the basement I'm basically based in this base from the bay shit

And they wanna say
That the bottoms is the bottom but I'm calling it the top
If they feel me then I got em on that Morrison
Music for this Tony I'm pursuing act a fool for your amusement and you don't know why I do it

I do it for my town, I do it for my gouda
I do it for my favorite artists so pardon my Sula
I do it for my pupils dilated in they schools who learn to cooly talk their shit cause they been treated like manure

My family for sure, who taught me to maneuver
And said embrace your contradictions cause nothing is truer
I'd let you be the juror but you lack all the facts
Cause I'm under-represented cept for my voice on these tracks

I'm picking up the slack of a bunch of lazy ears
Thinking I'm just making noise, blood I've been around for years
Shaking spears, kissing babies, making peers listen lately
They say "Diggs, you on some other shit" I tell 'em,"Maybe"

Other than what?
Other than Pac, other than Jay?
Other than B.I.G, other than Jeezy, Weezy, or Drake?
Other than say, a 40 Water although I keep my collar popped too?
Other than Keak although that is often what I rock to?

Is there anybody else you'd say this other shit too?
Am I gon be "other" whatever other shit I do?
Maybe I'm just other than famous
Maybe I just have to accept that that's where I'll remain

But if that's true
It won't be due to lack of noise making I'm a hammer these lyrics till the songs break pavement
I'm a cook these bars till the streets smell bacon
I'm a pig eating everything that's there for the taking

I'm making these statements just to get it on the record
If you should hear it hold me to it this is not a lecture
This is more a call to anybody within earshot
That from now on like it or not this nigga Diggs is here I got

A squad that a mob
On the game at the drop
Of a dime and its time
That you all know the name
This the Get Back behind me now watch how we game
"Hi I'm Daveed Diggs and I've got something to say"

I'm tired of worrying whether or not you will like it
I'm tired of tripping off whether somebody gon' buy it
I got a lot to holler, some bad, some good
Keep listening you'll witness something (fresh from the hood)
