[Verse 1]
Yeah
Beat wrecker, chip off the old block
Got the whole block trippin' off the flow, got
Block leaders takin' breaks from the blow
When I make them speakers bleed, block
Shit, let's go
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
Call me Ishmael
No Moby Dick
Slanger ho's know me, sick
So them chicks make me soup
Super Chef got the recipe to resuscitate a recessive pool
Genetically-engineered to exhibit a rapping fool
I'm the smartest nigga going stupid that you ever knew
Newest nigga to do it
Nike shoe and the boots bit
Busting the bluest Billy
Derivative cool shit
Pool stick, rack 'em up so I can break walls
Future soothsayer, Magic 8 Ball
But it's rarely black and white, I exist in the gray
Like a cloud hanging over the Bay
Watch for the rain!

[Chorus]
When you hear the man rapping, get your ass to the floor
I try to keep it cool but I can't take it no more
Let the haters hate and tell 'em they can come, too
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
And it's spreading 'cross the world
Now what the fuck you gon' do?

[Verse 2]
Rise and shine, the mantra of the rapper
Floss, go hard, shake babies, kiss rafters
Bandana, ace, deuce, chucking up the deuces
Drop the index to impress empresses with my rudeness
Like "wow, he really don't give a fuck"
No, baby, I don't
Maybe your baby done away with inhibitions
And during intermission he come back on a mission
To missile the middling milieu of narrow vision
So I'm hood to the marrow
Crunchy to the tarot
Black to the sparrow
Be the wheel to the barrow
The gang can hop in if it wants, I will carry it
As long as we all honor that that image is some scary shit
Cats say I'm too abstract for these beats
I tell 'em they a little too Georgia O'Keefe
And I am no Claude Monet for our day
Not impressed, nor impressionist
Nigga, I don't play

[Chorus]
When you hear the man rapping, get your ass to the floor
I try to keep it cool but I can't take it no more
Let the haters hate and tell 'em they can come, too
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
And it's spreading 'cross the world
Now what the fuck you gon' do?

[Verse 3]
They say "philosophize on trees falling in the forest"
Me? I'd rather bust three verses and a chorus
If no one hears your songs do they still make a sound?
Shit, I slap 'em in my own ride scrapin' through the town
That's a profound statment
Speakin' of that scrapin', when you make the bottom of the barrel
The heavy rotation
And tell us there's no choice, like we ain't got no voice
You finally heard the music like "what a beautiful noise!"
I've seen women faint in the crowd when I'm spittin' bars
I ain't no Michael Jackson, they was just giggin' too hard
Now that's the real power of this Jes Grew shit
Cause whatever noise you was making really didn't do shit
It was already intrinsic, intuitive when you witnessed it
Now I'm getting into it, brewing stew in the thick of it
To the wallflower or the whitewashing sounds:
You ain't gotta get dirty, but you will get down

[Chorus]
When you hear the man rapping, get your ass to the floor
I try to keep it cool but I can't take it no more
Let the haters hate and tell 'em they can come, too
They say I go - Shit, yeah I do
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
They say I go, nah nigga, I Jes Grew
And it's spreading 'cross the world
Now what the fuck you gon' do?
