[Verse 1 : Skepta]
I did a grime tune with Diddy, what did I get?
50 word article on the back of the paper, 1 2 mic check
Come again, I did a grime tune with Diddy but nobody weren't singing my praise
Then I released a porno video they put me on the front page
So find me on the tallest building in the country singing as loud as I can
I feel so alive and I couldn't give a damn bout any person who ain't part of the plan
Like it or not, the world is ours
Tell the police and security guards
When you looking for Boy Better Know better look to the stars
We'll be

[Hook]
Standing on the roof
And we ain't coming down, down
Unless you tell the truth
And spread it all around the town, town
We're standing on the roof

[Verse 2 : Shorty]
You would've though that I would've stuck to the music
No one used to care about Shorts
Then Shorty come on some new shit
See I'm on the top of the roof
With a mandem blazing a zoot
The truth is most man don't like me cause they girls keep calling me cute
All over the house, did you see that?
The whole UK couldn't believe that
Now they call Shorty a pornstar
...? a negative feedback
...? when I go I drop short notice
Slowly paved my way
Life looks much better from up here
So I think I might just stay

[Hook X2]
