[Intro]
Sounds of the Sir

[Verse 1]
If you can't see then you can't see clear
Grime takeover it's a peak year
If you don't do grime then you can't speak here
London sound not for the weekend
Boy Better Know we come from the streets here
Smoking weed drinking the sweet [?]
I was on road when you was on road but nobody took me for a chief there
Can't spit like this too much energy
Old school like Bossman Remedy
They're just pissed when they look at the scene
Man can't see them man in a legacy
Don't wanna see no bait guy breading me
Let me live my life live yours let it be
Shorty this, Shorty that
But man won't book them for 20p

[Chorus]
Yo, I'm like what's going on
Walk in the rave like, what's going on
Jump on stage like, what's going on
Everybody's getting brave now what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
I'm ready to ride out what's going on
Come straight to your hideout what's going on
Don't act like you don't know what's going on

[Verse 2]
Nuff man wanna talk about flows, but they're using my one
This flow weren't made in Taiwan
More like N17 in my [?]
Flow sick like ginger beer and white rum
You can't see what I see with the lights on
Jammer said "Jump on Lord of the Mics"
I was like "make sure you get me the right one"
They can't write what I type with my thumb
Every lyric that I write you can see that
Every lyric that I write is a clean fact
I don't lie about guns like an eediat
I don't lie about things that I don't do
Fam I don't lie on the streets like these tramps
Never had a [?] and I had about 3 shanks
Raving with straps while doing some deep skanks

[Chorus]
What's going on
Walk in the rave like, what's going on
Jump on stage like, what's going on
Everybody's getting brave now, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
I'm ready to ride out, what's going on
Come straight to your hideout, what's going on
Don't act like you don't know, what's going on

[Verse 3]
We're the best who's asking
It's bait look how I flew past him
I've been patiently waiting last time
But now manna come through barging
Fuck that I'm putting my leg and my arm in
I'm on a serious ting no laughing
A lot of man have come and gone in the game but
But manna still lasting
Comfy like a sweet [?]
Don't act like you don't know what's gwarning
When you see us man in the rave
You woulda thought that they just saw Bin Laden, madting
Man's still hating on Shorty, sadting
But I'm still out here moeshing
Nowadays man talk more than the girls
Boy Better Know I had to deal with their emotions (moesh)

[Chorus]
What's going on
Walk in the rave like, what's going on
Jump on stage like, what's going on
Everybody's getting brave now, what's going on
What's going on, what's going on
I'm ready to ride out, what's going on
Come straight to your hideout, what's going on
Don't act like you don't know, what's going on
