Man ah been doing this from day one

[Verse 1: Jammer]
Tell a man calm down, tell a man seckle
I get a reload when I say neckle

And when I say yeah
DJ pull up the tune like yeah
Gun fingers in the air like yeah
Boy Better Know for the rest of the year

[Verse 2: Hyper]
You're not from my way
Step on the manor and you'll get sprayed
From a Mac-10, Uzi or A.K
Clap, 1 (clap), 2 (clap), 3 (clap clap), pray
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, pray
Any breh that step in my way they'll pay
Open them up, feel no way
Guts on the floor all on display

[Verse 3: D Double E]

Mess with me
Bullets run out your kidney
Bullet hole the size of 1p

Cos they got pressed up and their arse look nice
But their insides ain't nice
Hit that with two rubbers, I'm nice

It's all bless innit
As long as you don't get fresh innit
Roll to the shubz in a blacked out jeep
Well it's all for the best innit
Your girl, I like her breasts innit (ah)
Love to see her undress innit
Took her to my yard just to watch TV
Next thing you know I was sexing it
