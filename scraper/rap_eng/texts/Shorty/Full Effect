[Verse 1: Jammin]
Tek wah and left wah?
Ayy, Rooney, money man ah mek
If I came to your yard with the something
Ayy, Rooney, money man ah tek
I don't wanna talk and bicker
I don't wanna squeeze on the trigger
Tell a boy cool and simmer
Before blood's flowing like damn river
These tomatoes better catch up
Don't see locks on my head but I'm a rasta
Yeah, you're a-lyin' like the one in Madagascar
And I might sing to your girl like Sampha
Man ah came from the boxes
Show me where the box is or you'll hold a box quick
Box inna face
Oh, what? Is that it, yeah? Alright
Mek them know

[Verse 2: Frisco]
Yo, Dangles, tell the DJ
Play this song right now or it's bare shots
Big 45 make your whole team clear off
War with Fris? Get your headside tear off
Out to those that don't do grime anymore
TBH, that's their loss
Man said he's prepared to die for his bredrin
Cool, then both of you can share shots
Hennessy in my plastic cup
Make sure the weed plastic elastic up
And if I say MAC, dun know
Try know there's gonna be a massacre
Full effect, spread the word
Real badboy, I still rep the curb
I'm no gussy, I kill MCs in a hurry
So they best [?]

[Chorus: Jammin]
Top shottas are back
In full effect
In full effect
In full effect
Top shottas are back
In full effect
In full effect
In full effect
Top shottas are

[Verse 3: Shorty]
Years later, man are still moeshing
Look at the haters, still sulking
Look how my paper keeps folding
My iPhone just can't stop roaming
I'm on 100%, you're loading
I get along with my shit, you're moaning
Step back if you're not rolling
We've come to end daylight with the Romans
Trying to spread my sound like Logan
Show them about my streets
Let the whole world know about my peeps
You know heat bars, you know hype beats
You know stage shows, you know bright lights
Blood, sweat and tears in the nightlife
Gotta make sure I'm on the right vibe
Cause right now, it feels like the right time

[Chorus: Jammin]
Top shottas are back

In full effect
In full effect
Top shottas are back
In full effect
In full effect
In full effect

[Chorus: Jammin]
Top shottas are back

Top shottas are back
