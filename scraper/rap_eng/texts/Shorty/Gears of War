[Verse 1]
Still here with the people I came with
Still got the same flow but I trained it
It's bait that I'm Grime's most dangerous
It's bait that my flow's contagious
They wanna be like uuuuuuussss
They ain't got the heart or the patience
Merk man in a rave merk on the station
BBK stick together like [?]
Shorty sick with the flow from ages
Been hotting up mics for a hot sec
Took a little bit of time now I got rep
They all know my name when I'm on set
Now they're watching me close like Ofsted
They wanna know who I fucked if I got head
Pray every night that my enemies drop dead
I've got time but I ain't got a lot left
Got a lot on my mind that I've not said
Some things just don't need repeating
Used to stay in my bed till the evening
Light a zoot still felt like I'm dreaming
Fam I was counting dots on the ceiling
Now I'm counting Euro or Sterling
From Ayia Napa to Berlin
Every time I get on the stage I'm merking
At the same time I'm learning
You never thought that I would get this great
You never thought you would see me in this shape
You never thought I'd be selling them mixtapes
Got your judgement wrong what a mistake
Lyrically you're a dumbbell I'm [?]
I'm one of the best get this straight
If you don't like me you must have shit taste

[Hook]
Stay humble, stay focused
'Cause out here we're surrounded by jokers
'Nuff man wanna talk about straaaaps but they can't kill a locust
Stay humble, stay focused
'Cause out here we're surrounded by jokers
'Nuff man wanna talk about straaaaps but they can't kill a locust
Stay humble, stay focused
'Cause out here we're surrounded by jokers
'Nuff man wanna talk about straaaaps but they can't kill a locust
Stay humble, stay focused
'Cause out here we're surrounded by jokers
'Nuff man wanna talk about straaaaps but they can't kill a locust

[Verse 2]
Shorty, old school like kiss chase
Done a lot of things that I can't take back
Done a lot of drugs but I won't take crack
Used to beat bare back now it ain't that
'Cause I've seen bare man in the same trap
Now they've got a yute with the dumb shit
Always arguing over dumb shit
A life contract with some dumb bitch
Life's fucked up like it or lump it
Make sure you're positive at all times
Negative people have small minds
Do what you wanna do live your life
Do what you wanna do do your grind
A couple man still talking but they're small fries
You can ask C4 everyting's alright
Every time I drop my shit there's more flies
Any time my man spit that's more lies
Nah we don't believe what you say though
We don't believe that you've got an AK bro
You're not a Top Boy, you're not Kano
Just a washed up guy with the same flow
Never gonna make it never gonna make dough
I've seen a lot of guys doing this ting
But I never hear my man's tunes on the radio
Never see my man there on a stage show
How you gonna try fuck with the greatest
How you gonna try fuck with the playlist
How you gonna try pray with an Atheist
How you gonna try fuck with the team
You ain't got enough characters in your status[?]
See my bars them unite the ravers
Gunfingers, Air Max trainers
