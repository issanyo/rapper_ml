[Verse 1: Frisco]
Tell a man make way for the system killer
You got cuff 'cause you're too damn inner
I don't jingle bells, I ring the bells
I eat emcees like a Christmas dinner
On the first day of Christmas, she said to me
You know what, forget it, I'm sure that you get it
Jme made the beat, when I heard it, I said "That's me"
It's all festive, banter
I like ice in my Fanta
Big time money banker
Wrapping up more emcees than Santa
And I just want you to remember
This one's for the 25th of December
We show love on my corner
But it's straight gunshot for an informer

[Verse 2: Jammer]
Run in the yard and kick down the Christmas tree
Kick down the Christmas turkey
I'm a big man but I'm not thirty
And me and my G's dem are certi'
Boy Better Know
Man have got the Christmas flows
Flows dem are cold like Christmas, ho, ho, ho
Phone my line for the snow
See me in North London like show, show, show
Me and my niggas dem are winning like... (Go, go, go)
DJ pull it back like... (Bo, bo, bo)
Man have got bars and flows
I don't wanna tell them... (Shut up)
Wrap man like Santa (Shank him)
Gucci in Alanta
Yeah that's how I'm feeling

[Verse 3: Shorty]
We are the kings
Don't eat turkey but I sing hymns
Don't eat anything that's got limbs
Don't ask me if I want any trimmings
I go to the barbers if I want trim
Pigs in blankets, straight in the bin
Dash them mince pies out of the tin
Santa Claus, I don't know him
I just robbed six geez for about five rings
Man better know theirself
Can't take Shorty for Christmas elf
Too much eggnog's bad for your health
I'll box those Christmas cards off the shelf
You must be bluffing
If you think man eats Christmas stuffing
I will start acting like Jme
Elbow drop Rudolph, it's nothing

[Verse 4: Jme]
Man get shook
When I jump down the chimney, covered in soot
You can't walk one step in my shoes
You can't put your foot where my foot's put
Draw for the paintball gun
And spray man with M&M's and Minstrels
Round here the bells don't jingle
Fly kick the man with the beard and wrinkles
Mandem, show me the signal
Simple, man will get wrapped like tinsel
Whacked in the head with the Christmas chair fam
Open your presents, smash that Kindle, dead pixels
Man can never go pop, are you mad fam?
Pop, that's pistol
Pop, that's pimple
Pop, that's Pringle
Pop, that's Christmas number one single

[Verse 5: Skepta]
Man have got me on a Christmas ting when you dun know already, I'm a Halloween man
Heard about the big fat guy with the white beard coming to the house, still haven't seen man
Light the fireplace, fuck that shit
How many years are we gonna wait for the prick?
Told mum I'm sorry but Jason asked me and I had to say what it is
So tell Santa, cancel the Uber
Who bought the gifts this year? That's Junior
Dex said that lateness ain't greatness
The world is our's now, should've come sooner
Man ain't getting a better present than the SkAirs
And really and truly, I'm just tryna see the new year
Gotta wait another six days, fam it ain't fair
