[Verse 1: Frisco]
Ay Rude Kid
Rolling about [?]
Suit black, cap, 110s and a big flat
If you fuck with my vibe
Somebody getting skied
I'm as high as you like
You'll make me put down the mic
Come around and settle your hype (Settle)
When you hear this on your CD Jay, Jme and [?], that's BBK (Boy Better Know)

[Verse 2: Jammer]
Serious serious
I call this Jme
That's why they can't run a day with me
Man are high off of life like Jme
These pussyholes wanna spray with me
But I tell pussyholes don't play with me
Man are so high
Roll by wavy G
80's baby, class '90

[Chorus x12]
I'm so high

[Verse 3: Jme]
High, passively
So much smoke in the air right here, I swear this bassline's slapping me
Make the crowd cheer and clap and scream
Man wanna hate say I'm crap an'
He's not rapping
He's not trapping
Bruv shut your mouth before I start slapping
Can't jump on the track because man's lapping
Whoosh

[Verse 4: Shorty]
The weed that I'm strapping's kush
When it comes to smoking a dubplate
Bust that strap, my ting, my own way
Unorthodox like No Lay
Sometimes I get so high rudeboy, don't wanna come down for the whole day
You got bars but your flow's got no shape
If you ain't levelling then don't spray

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Rascals]
So high
Living on a plant for the whole night
I was really raised on the roadsides
I lived the high life
E3, Lon
Spin an MC if he tries hype
Yeah I'm on a wave, real grime
And I've been around from day
And it's boy better know [?]
And a boy better know when they see my team

[Verse 6: Frisco]
And when you see my team, it's a mad thing, trust me
(Skied) That's what you get if you touch me
Six million ways to murder the riddim and you know I ain't gonna let you down, you can trust me
Wear into your MC life in no time
I ain't taking cheque from no guy
So high, no tide when I roll by
I'm the pote guy
No lie and you know why

[Chorus]
