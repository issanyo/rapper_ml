(Chorus)

Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
And pass it around the crew be cause the crew be all that

Hey yo, hickory dickory dock I'm under the Brooklyn block yes
Who's the next to testify and try and penetrate the vest
Diggatie do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do I draw back my bozac
I take it in track and give it a smack and cuttin no slack, jack
Okay here I go shorty tap the forty O smash
To a pass, if ya crash make a dash to the trash
Tap the cap, have a lot and not a lot, not a little
Don't grade upon the label take a guzzle, don't dribble
I got the supercalafragileisticexpialadou-cious
You're comin too close a to this, I get fero-cious
Coax this rhyme, smoke this rhyme hype
When we rockin upon the mic, we rock the mic right
Pass the funnel to the tunnel, I get busy till I'm dizzy
Never pass it to get fizzy cause the god gets busy, who is he?
Damn just pass it cold the cipher
When I hit the dread spot I buy a can of Red Stripe, so

Chorus (Repeat 1x)

Well I be comin' around the mountain with my ho Suzanna
I'm peelin off the caps like the hicks in Alabama
Check the grammar and the stamina I'm tootin' on my horn
Timberland boot stompin' forty drinkin born
Malt liquor chug a filter let me rip it then I kick it
Tap it once for my brothers sip it then I sip it
So xerox the zip code, I'm in the mode, perfecto
Hallelujah here I go, watch me flow and let go
Trouble shooter smoke the buddah rule like a dictator
Used to hit the fader now I play the commentator
So let me swing it from the rhyme to the concrete jungle
With the King Areis Mackin, rulin' over knuckle
Heads to the bed, cause Right Said Fred
Lock em up with the beeswax, kick it to em dread
Yo, pass the peas please party trooper, party stop
64 will give ya more if ya scammin on the block
Red top, red top, bust open krill's dope
But if you're drinkin too slow you might kiss the steel toe
Just keep the cypher movin' everything's be fine
And the forty's stops here till I finish my rhyme

Chorus (Repeat 2x)

Balance on the beam, here we go team, hype!
Pass the mic down the line, on time, drop the rhyme
I rope a rope-a-dope smokin with the red beam scopin'
Pull a magnum body back and leave a back bone broken
So was a bend a trend I'm sendin and I'm cruisin' for a hit
When I'm just sittin' in the outhouse droppin mad shhhhhhhh
Quiet on the set while the crew be gettin' wrecked
And if your stunned by the bunch I have a hunch you should step
So pass me the crazy straw and let me do the Q-Tip
What is a forty if I can't take a sip?
Sometimes I drive slow sometimes I drive fast
Sometimes I'm on E sometimes I get gas
So check the stress sure to step to the left
With an OE tap on the top, pass it back
Give a tap to the child, pass it, sorry, keep it goin
Down my throat I keep it flowin, styles keep growin'
We don't brown bag it, the label be showin'
And we don't give a damn if the hoes be knowin'
From the drip to my lip I like to pass it with a grip
Shorty-Dog is in the cypher, so you better not skip

Chorus (Repeat 2x)
