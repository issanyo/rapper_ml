5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting
Everyting's live

[Verse 1]
5 foot 5 with a low cut
I look young but I'm a grownup
Come a long way since Too Many Man
Now promoters are ringing my phone up
I remember when I got no love
Sitting at home like a doughnut
Now they say "Shorty's siiick"
They can't believe that I ain't thrown up
Done so many shows that it's normal
Newcastle back down to Cornwall
Sometimes I gotta tone it down
Make sure my vocab's formal
Go Bruce Grove, get my haircut
Girls say I'm cute like a teddy bear but
See now I get bare teddy bear love
Mash up the ting then clear off

[Hook]
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting

[Verse 2]
Who's better than the crew I spray with
Who's collecting the wage slips
Who's been around since face [?]
Who's running it up I can't take it
Man see me and think that I made it
I can't blame 'em, I've made changes
But I swear to God I won't change this
To go back to the roads that's brainless
Now I'm sitting in the 5 star hotel
Smoking weed with a showgirl
She only met me in the club
But she feels she knows me so well
Pop off the phone start moeshing
Then get my back rub with lotion
I'm on a quick ting not on a slow ting
Then I'm gone again, ghosting

[Hook]
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting

[Verse 3]
They heard me on Logan's, merking
They're hating but it ain't working
I used to dream of having a name now Shorty ain't any person
I sat down I put the work in
Non-stop work like a servant
I never knew much about this music game at the start
But I'm finally learning
I learnt from the best no breh
Boy Better Know 'till I'm there
I dare these likkle waste MCs violate the team I rep
Mind how you walk watch your step
'Cause you never know what to expect
Yeah I'm talking to you, you, you and that [?]

[Hook]
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting
5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting's live, 5 foot 5, everyting everyting

[Outro]
5 foot 5
Everyting's live
I don't wanna go jail so I don't hide
I just wanna be the best so I write
5 foot 5
Everyting's live
I don't wanna go jail so I don't hide
I just wanna be the best so I write
5 foot 5
Everyting's live
I don't wanna go jail so I don't hide
I just wanna be the best so I write
5 foot 5
Everyting's live
5 foot 5
Everyting's live
5 foot 5
Everyting everyting
