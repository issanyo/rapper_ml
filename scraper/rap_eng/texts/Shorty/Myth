[Pre-Hook: Blay]
Piff
Every tune I write is potent piff
Every tune I've heard of yours is shit
Run your mouth, you get boxed in the rib
I can have man flying in the sky for a drib
These mandem don't care where you live
Tom-Tom's got man calm in the bits
That guy there was far from a Sith
We can all tell you're a pagan myth

[Hook: Blay]
When I wrote your name on YouTube, myth
When I wrote your name on Google, myth
When I wrote your name on iTunes, myth
When I wrote your name on Amazon, myth
When I wrote your name on Yahoo, myth
When I see your name in public, myth
Wait, is my man taking the piss?
About you rep grime, you're a blatant myth

[Verse 1: Blay]
I don't know these niggas
Matter of fact, check my iPhone registry
You will see I don't phone these niggas
Everybody wants P but
Nobody wants to put work in and grow these figures
I went back to the lab with nuttin' but piff and vision
Man didn't listen, I will spin MCs
Till man's sit-down pissing
Vision could never be who you are dissing
Fuck that, I ain't coming back with a backpack
On my back, slap everyone in your snapbacks
One box, leave him on the floor with a bad back
Everybody's rough till the yard gets ransacked
Got niggas that I couldn't even ask for
Have the whole rave swimming on the dancefloor
These man don't know about potent piff

[Verse 2: Flirta D]
When you're onstage, they're like "who's th-this?"
When I'm onstage, they all know what it is
Some of them signed but they still sound shit
Compared to the mandem, compared to the myth
You could ask Riv, Big, Napper or Shizz
Ask H and Dan, I've been doing this
All you man do is ruin everything
We bawsy as fuck but not doing anything
Sorry, I didn't quite catch your name
Was that you, bastard? Didn't catch a wave
Wanna hype up? You can catch a flame
We can do it old school and I'll smack your face
You ain't fucking with Shorty, Flirts or Blay
Violate, I'mma send a man to space
You're a myth, not in a type of way
You're just shit and a pile of waste

[Pre-Hook: Blay]
Every tune I write is potent piff
Every tune I've heard of yours is shit
Run your mouth, you get boxed in the rib
I can have man flying in the sky for a drib

About you rep grime, you're a blatant myth

[Verse 3: Shorty]
You're a blatant myth
Nobody cares who you are
No human, no computer
No schoolkids wanna hear you bar
No girls wanna roll with you, rudeboy
Even if you had a new car
You've got no plan, got no future
And that badboy act don't suit ya
It don't measure up, even with a ruler
Got bars that your girl sings
Got bars for the skets and the church tings
Bars for the guys that are hardworking
The name's Shorty, check the status
Bare go-getters here, no waiters
They tried to catch up but they can't catch up
But the flow's that fucked, fam, I'm like laters

[Verse 4: Skepta]
Yeah, yeah, let me spark this loud
Take two draws and I pass it around
When I touch mic in a dance, security's on the dancefloor
Just tryna calm tings down
When you touch mic, I'm like "ah, this clown"
None of my niggas are feeling your sound
I'm big in my city and I'm big in your town
Said you're the best, them man are like how?
Man wanna war with the Lord of the Mic (go on then)
My man must wanna die (go on then)
I'mma have to slew ten guys
And remind pussyholes how I got my stripes
I got porn stars that just wanna drink
Video girls that just wanna bun
You do videos, girls don't wanna come
'Cause in my last video, I was looking oh so piff
