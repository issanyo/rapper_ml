[Bridge]
And there's a
Million voices
And there's a
Million voices
And there's a
Million voices
And there's a
Million voices

[Verse 1]
I can be on my way home walking, or drinking tea in the morning
Or with Boy Better Know touring, believe me blud I hear voices talking
At first I thought it was nothing, saying to myself "Shorty you're buzzin'"
Then one or two turned into a dozen, it's weird the main one sounds like my cousin
But I can't be the only one with this, it's a little bit more than a sickness
I don't wanna be that guy with a slit wrist, so I act like it don't even exist
I could have went mad time ago, but I ain't crumbled like biscuits
It's too deep for a doctor to fix this, much more than gonorrhea or syphilis
Blud it's a deep ting, but Shorty ain't no weakling
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming, 'cause I can't see no one but I hear speaking
But I can't go crazy, or lose myself like Slim Shady
My dad went jail in the eighties, that's why I weren't your average baby
But, but maybe, I shoulda listened to Jamie
When he said all of this smoking and drinking, one day it's gonna fuck up your thinking
I didn't listen to him back then, now it's all starting to sink in
God forgive me for my choices, 'cause I hear a million voices

[Hook]
And there's a
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices

[Verse 2]
I know that I'll be blessed though, I know I'll be okay
See these voices help me out all day, they help me write "yeah that's BBK"
Plus they help me get out the way, in sync when they started to spray
It was me, Skepta and Potts, there was much more than a few shots
See your voice helped me get out of that one
A real gunshot, not a cap gun
A voice once told me to laugh not fight when the racist's call me 'black scum'
See I coulda been locked up, or I coulda been dead
Even back then when I went to bed, I had a million voices in my head
As I got older, some of the voices got colder
Like "Shorty go get a gun", I just laughed "ha, joker"
The voice I hate the most, turned me into a smoker
Made me lose all my dough on poker, made my mind twisted like yolk
Sometimes I try not to listen, sometimes I wish I could kill them
But I can't make a decision, so i just wait on a voice
Sometimes I don't know if it's the right choice, it's much more then a few noises
God forgive me for my choices, 'cause I hear a million voices

[Hook]
And there's a
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
First there was one then there was two, (And there's a) now there's a whole crew
Million voices
And there's a
Million voices
