[Verse 1: Jammer]
Listen
Boy Better Know is a team
Me and my G's are living that dream
Man can't play with the cream
Man are in the whipping excursion inside the whippiest cream
Me and my G's we skeen, gotta stick to the routine
Cuh manaman rep for the scene, keeping it real is the theme
Dem man run out of steam
Dem man run out of gas
Dem man run out of cash
Dem man run out of shells
Dem man run out of mash
Man are old school like CK Flash
Walk in the dance with the camera's flash
Don't know why man are acting flash
Thinking you're Gordon, but you're not Flash
Thinking you're Gordon, but you're not Ramsay
Thinking you're Marcus, but you're not Ramsay
Thinking you're Marcus, but you're not anti
Draw for the ting, get your jawside mankey
I compete all the girls you fancy
So you better dab on your girl like [?]
Dem man are weaker than [?] Bambi
Mum will get bottled up just like brandy

[Chorus: Jammer]
Don't play around with the cash
(Don't play around with the cash)
Chilling with Dex and [?]
(Chilling with Dex and [?])
All of my Gs on gas
(All of my Gs on gas)
BBK, we got it on smash

[Verse 2: JME]

[Chorus: Jammer]
Don't play around with the cash
(Don't play around with the cash)
Chilling with Dex and [?]
(Chilling with Dex and [?])
All of my Gs on gas
(All of my Gs on gas)
BBK, we got it on smash

[Verse 3: Shorty]

[Chorus: Jammer]
Don't play around with the cash
(Don't play around with the cash)
Chilling with Dex and [?]
(Chilling with Dex and [?])
All of my Gs on gas
(All of my Gs on gas)
BBK, we got it on smash

Don't play around with the cash
(Don't play around with the cash)
Chilling with Dex and [?]
(Chilling with Dex and [?])
All of my Gs on gas
(All of my Gs on gas)
BBK, we got it on smash
