[Hook: DJ Maximum] (x4)
Dem manna move shaky, shaky, shaky
Us manna move gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1: Newbaan]
Rifle a wave, rifle a claat
Rifle a murder dem bomboclaat
Little fool, lest we donâ€™t make di war start
If you run inna di crowd then di croud haffi part
All if you run inna di childrens park
Mi a kill yoo right deso cause me nuh have no heart
Shots bite of heads like a baby shark
And bend up him bloodclaat body like fork
Yeah from a war me nah chase
Me a fight till me dead like Scarface
Portmore, Waterford a di war base
Q-Tips for all who have hard ears
Real killers nuh response

[Hook: DJ Maximum] (x4)
Dem manna move shaky, shaky, shaky
Us manna move gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Skepta, yeah
Touch down in Kingston, Jamaica, yes indeed
Me and my G's bunnin' zest in the streets
You can see us, lookin' lean up
Screaming Nicodemus rest in peace
Coconut fresh from the tree
Oh yeah Carline tell Ninja bless for the weed
Before you spark it check for police
I stain a boys garms like Fanta
Lyrically I bring the goods like Santa
Where's my laptop? Pass my adaptor
Said they wanna clash, I said "Alright rasta"
Yeah, cause like Mister Palmer
I got little 'tugs that'll run upp in your house if you diss the master
You nasty rasta
Girls suck me off and you kiss them after

[Verse 3: Lay-Z]
Yeah, fried fish in a festival
Touch down in yard and a couple man spit, still feel like I am the best of all
Frisco said should we link down with Soundbwoy, I said like "fam I will test them all"
I will link down any MC that moves shaky round me, there's no time to rest at all
Met a couple dons who though they were always right, now look I've left them all
Heard a couple dons are looking for me and my mates, try and now I ain't stressed at all
Walk with a Jesus piece, but if we should meet, try and know you ain't blessed at all
Went from the student straight to the teacher, just know man never left the school

[Hook: DJ Maximum] (x4)
Dem manna move shaky, shaky, shaky
Us manna move gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 4: Jammer]
Yo, listen
I was in Jam down chillin' with family
Land of Bob Marley, Michael Manley
I was by the sea where the beach is sandy
Manna got the apple on rum and the brandy
Us man are wavey don
None of my dons move shaky don
See me with ninja, the dons have dons
Any violation, bust gun like gong
Come on [?]
I got a 16 bar that will shell them
Put in head that'll saw them
Man respect heaven and hell then
Say you know bad man, bell them
I don't wanna hear man talkin'
Leave a MC dead by the weekend
MCs wanna try and jump on my wave
But they're all gonna drown in the deep end

[Verse 5: Frisco]
I'ma big what?, big who? big mic man
I'mma flow dem
I got flow for days so likkle man better act like you know man
Creps lookin' all barbaric, Konan
Touch down in Jamaica, ring the link' dem, tell'em the mandems in town
Man wanna scream out, shout out man, but don't know who you mention Jim Brown (shaky)
Kill MCs as a past time
Draw somethin' out of the archive
Bandana, spliff full of weed and grabba
On the veranda, yard side
Me fall of that's a far cry
I come to shine like star light, alright
R.I.P. if you're prayin' on my downfall
If it's teef get more than a mouthful

[Hook: DJ Maximum] (x4)
Dem manna move shaky, shaky, shaky
Us manna move gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 6: Solo 45]
Capo, there's 206 bones in my body
Nigga there's not one shaky bone in my body
Tottenham man in Jamaica
Cold Heineken, open shirt up
Parts can't click with badman
Bun off the talk, some Ricky Lake-a
It's just me, me, me
I really squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Girl at the bar just slipped me her number
She wants to beat, beat, beat
Some time it's bad boys can't chat to me
Ain't scared of anything, heart's too clean
Between you, your God and pillow
Know you're a idiot, know you're a chief

[Verse 7: Shorty]
Yeah I'm finally here
Yeah I'm back in J-A
BBK on the island, make way
Landed then went out on the same day
Me, Solo and Lay-Z at the front row
Vibesing, the rest of the crew on the same wave
Little bit of high grade, little bit of Wray Wray
Got my head spinnin' real fast like a Beyblade
Lick off your head like an AK
I'll make Ninjaman know a [?]
You better listen when the dan gorgon ah talk up
Met [?] apartment
Chillin' with U-Roy in his front garden
Let man know what's gwanin'
Big spliff and a rum punch in the morning
BBK and J-A on a hard ting

[Hook: DJ Maximum] (x4)
Dem manna move shaky, shaky, shaky
Us manna move gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
