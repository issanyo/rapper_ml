[Intro]
Come on ladies, come on ladies, one pound fish [x3]
One pound fish, one pound fish

[Chorus]
Have a, have a look, one pound fish
Have a, have a look, one pound fish
Very very good, one pound fish
Very very cheap, one pound fish
Six for five pound, one pound each
Six for five pound, one pound each
Fish today, one pound [x4]

[Verse 1: Shorty]
Five-foot-five, on some deep shit
Used to get no love, now they're like, "he's sick"
Everywhere I go, yeah, they wanna hear me spit
The most improved MC on the scene with
Five of the best out now, so leave it
Used to sell a little bit of weird on the T strip
Pushing my weight, yeah shank in my jeans bit
Now I go Spearmints, they give me a free strip
They can't sit in the chair that we sit
21st century kings, believe it
Anything you want out here, you can achieve it
It's just a likkle harder, than the previous
It can get a likkle darker, when the heat spit
I don't wanna see nada, but a P flip
I don't want no drama, with an idiot
Shorty, Skepta, J, one pound [laughs], moesh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, I'm a self-made G, from my hood, called Meridian
Made it out the hood, now I'm tryna make a million
Real grime nigga, like Elijah & Skilliam
Pussy violate my family, then I'm killin' em
My niggas get straps by the wholesale
Manchester niggas told me they got a load of shells
Touchdown, shout Holly Flynn, that's my homegirl
Me and Shorty smoking cheese in the hotel
Leave the hotel, looking like a pigsty
Go North Wells, check Wiz Rob and Big Kai
Dancefloor packed, so we bought a table
I make it back tomorrow, and I put that on my label
Diamonds on my mouth, and I look so icy
I don't play games, but I'm playing with your wifey
I told her "Don't touch, keep your hands off"
No handjob, I'm going in like a bank job

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: JME]
Well well well, yeah fam, it's Jamie
If you wanna see me on stage, pay me
I don't drink or smoke
But I bust bare joke, so everybody thinks I'm wavy
Milkshake city, milkshakes, I like them
Roll Sidneys before the night ends
But if I got a booking, just jump in the whip
And let's roll to the dance, alright then
Get to the rave, dancefloor is now packed
Some girls stink of BO and cowpat
And after the dance, when I jump in my car
They try jump in my car, allow that
Every man blazing zoots, except me
Didn't conform for them to accept me
But when belly empty, now everybody wants the one pound fish
Ya get me

[Chorus]
