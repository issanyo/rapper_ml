[Verse 1 - Solo 45]
(Yeah , Uh) That pagan , World Star  that pagan (X7)
BACK THE FUCK UP NIGGA , OR I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF
DICKHEAD (DICKHEAD) , BACK THE FUCK UP NIGGA , OR I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF (DICKHEAD)
There's a problem in the building, a bunch of fucking pagans
DICKHEAD (DICKHEAD) , BACK THE FUCK UP NIGGA , OR I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF (DICKHEAD)

[Verse 2 - Frisco]
I'm so BBK, me and my team run tracks like a relay
If a man thinks I won't pop off my new ting fam you would get an action replay
25 teeth in your frame no delay, I'm the ting no he say she say
Them man are some weekend bad man and some big waste man in the weekday
MC's get munched i'll dead them all , i'll end them all cos to me they're edible
Incredible like General Levy , MC's falling to me there's several
Give me a buff ting that's flexible, back shots gotta go in hysterical
No lies i'm the same i'm both sides , I won't lie my patterns symmetrical
If you think you're ready then come fam , I will get man bunned for less than one grand
Furthermore you don't want beef like a herbivore, you best tie up your Nikes and run fam
Won't sell out the ting like some man, conspire against me what a dumb plan
See my darg in the background can't put the strap down , he's just itching to bun man
Kill'em all in, all the alphabetical, i'm credible, send guys to the medical
If it gets technical, it's peak for you , Frisco's offence ain't defend-able
So go against my team ain't sensible, legendary like one of the expendables
Salute to the general, big dutty stinking going on terrible

[Verse 3 - Jammer]
Leave MCs in pieces like Reeces
I was feeding the thousands like Jesus
I was doing way too many features
Don't fuck up the bass like tinny speakers
When I spit my bars it's an energy burst
So you'd better check your energy first
Boy better know that I ain't talking sweets when I tell 'em that a star will burst
