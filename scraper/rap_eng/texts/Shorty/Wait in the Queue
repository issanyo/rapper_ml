[Intro]
Shorty,
Moesh,
Rah its been ages,
mans been everywhere though,
seen everything, mad stages, mad languages, it's crazy,
mans still got this though,
Yo

[Verse 1]
Gunfingers, airmax trainers,
take two two pics for the ravers,
man in the ends think that I'm famous,
cause I move more major than the majors,
nuttin' ain't changed got a little more papers,
can't lie got a little more status,
circles tight I dont wanna see strangers,
man are ungrateful, done with the paigons.
I told dem man laters, violate once then it's over,
my young buck just bought a revolver, dying to let off a shot like Solskj√¶r,
you're gonna need more than Jesus Christ, gonna need much more than Jehovah,
you're gonna need more than yoda, more luck than a four leaf clover,
scrap that lets talk about [?]
or when us man shutdown sonar, this year mans travelled all over the globe, done more air miles than a soldier, didn't wanna listen back then when i told ya, name a crew that's going on colder,
this ting that we do,
it ain't new,
check out the Boy Better Know folder,
always high never sober,
If im not rolling then I'm drinking,
if I'm not talking then im thinking,
if you're not floating then you're sinking,
don't jump on the wave, try get brave, nah it's not that day,
we're not in the same league or the same wage,
us man are living the dream on the stage,
we're not on the same page,
call us grime monarchy,
man know now ironically, stuck to the sames rules same policy,
right now man are playing monopoly,
man might take over your property,
right now fam there's no stopping me,
man know man do this properly,
it's our time now obviously,
so many years getting parred off,
if you wanna book B-B-K now, its gonna cost you a leg and an arm off,
we've been merking 'Napa for years, you can ask them or you can ask Marcus.
(oi ask dem man dere man)
Been there done that seen nuff dramas, thank God that I come out the good side,
I just wanna live life on a good vibe,
see me out having a good time,
eating good, drinking the good wine and it's all in good time,
all eyes on us that's a good sign,
now watch real G's from the hood shine,
but we're not the good guys,
but we made it thru,
who's leveling up, fam name me a few,
who's better than us, fam name me a crew,
I've been on so many flights this year, the aircon gave me the flew,
straight after the flight, I'll be blazing a zute,
I'm in the front of the line, you better wait in the queue.

[Outro]
Wait in the queue rudeboy
Yeah
Nah stand there
Yeah
