[Verse 1]
So much on my mind to say, so much on my mind today
Shit, I don't even do coke, but I'm like a line away
Sitting in bed, lying awake, with a spliff the size of my face
I quit smoking about five times last week, but fam, I just like the taste
I've got so much love for the family
What I said on Blacklisted was real, but it's like man don't understand me
And want me to go on a solo ting with a big 45 like Andy
Show these man that I'm not a pansy
Don't wanna make a man's top go cranberry
But I can't say that I won't if I'm angry
There's only one plan, fuck a plan B
