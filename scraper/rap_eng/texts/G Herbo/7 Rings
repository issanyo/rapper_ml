Gotta keep my head up while I'm walking I know niggas watching
I'm chasing gwuala while they plotting I can't let that stop me
And M.I.A yo down collage riding mosiradi
I came from Essex speeding high c it's just me and Molly
Call for that check I'm gone pull up dolo I don't need nobody
Nobody try me yeah you Know I'm gone catch me a body
Just came off tour all sold out shows no sleep caught me a zombie
I was up all night just counting 100s foe nem fucking thoties
And when you up all of these niggas wanna be ya partner but ain't nobody fuck with me when I ain't have a dollar
Cause I ain't been in the streets I been stuck on the grind guess niggas act like they want problems I just been busy doin me can't wait to buy some Chopper's

[Verse 2]

Big G herbo call me thousand killed a thousand rymes
Young nigga grinding touched a thousand like a thousand times
My moma told me you one thousand
I got tired of lien
I accept life and everything come wit it down the line
Yeah you real you a hunnid you a thousand nigga
That's the reason why you always around yo niggas
You gone sore up to the top and you gone drown wit niggas
Yeah you gone ride to the finish pound and pound with niggas
You ask yo self what you gone do when it go down wit niggas
You worth a hundred thousand worried bout a thousand niggas
A hunnid cash you just breathing you can hardly live
I watched a quarter mill poof and I ain't hardly spend
