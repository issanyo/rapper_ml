[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
I'm from the corner of no love, down the street from dyin' hopes
Shortys grew up by that stove, want nothin' to do but buy their coke
Me and broski, girl they clockin' fiends shopin' hug the block, that's not an option
Bitch, I got rich off that profit and that's real life
Trappin' down, that's real life, they [?] that's guild life
Yeah, not tryna kill life like how the fuck you kill life?
Pray he get that appeal tonight, what if I sign my deal tonight?
Take a couple mil tonight, I wounder what I fill my life
Police always tryna read my rights like ridin' with that cane right?
Nigga wanna take my life like I don't wanna lay at night
Kiss my sister in the morning, I'mma do that if she mornin'
Any sense of threat I'm blowin', it ain't no tellin' where I'm goin'
Father, god, forgive me for my sins
I'm just tryna win, only you know where I've been
Only I know who I am, and alone is where I stand
Funny how the first to fuck you be your family and your friends, nigga

[Hook:]
Stronger [?]
I will love you even more
Ooh, I'm thinkin' back
And [?]
[?] you
Baby where you--
Never looked at me
Now the light inside of me
Ooh, I'm thinkin' back, and you know baby

[Verse 2: Pappi]
I consider us different when truthfully that's no different
My skin tone's the same, completion shows a little [?]
Oh cuz I stood up on the curb I was tryna get in shit?
My mama never married my pops [?] no tuition and
Everything I learn I learned just like a fisherman
Cast my real out on whatever hook I'm dealin' with
Grandma used to put me on games with a intuition and
Never stop roll though I changed a few missions and
I see why Mr. [?] never hunger out Benjamin
Cut a few off that was only there for the benifits
And I'd be damned  if they even order me off my dental plan
I ain't [?] settle for a little bit
I've been doin' this since the shorty with me
Workin' hard for what I got, more than 40 a week
And you'll probably never understand this life I live
Unless it's my life you live

[Hook:]
