[Hook: Lil Bibby & Lil Herb]
Im a no limit nigga
That's my motha fucking gang
(No limit nigga)
Who I'm riding with?
All my hittas
Where we at?
We on 79th, we on 79th
Im a no limit nigga
Thats my motha fucking gang
(No limit nigga)
Who I'm riding with?
All my hittas
Where my niggas at?
We on 79th, we on 79th

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Big bucks i get bucks
You got bucks we stick up
Act tough get hit up
Get laid down then picked up
I be riding in my new thang
Listening to my old shit
Catch a nigga lackin'
I'ma feed his ass the whole clip
Dump and tell him "hold it"
Better stay focused nigga
You don't really want them hittas on yo ass
You don't wanna see Lil Bibby in a mask
Hopped out broad day and bust a nickel on yo ass
Riding in the Jag and I gotta bad bitch
No Limit the team we got shooters like the mavericks
Gotta have a lot cause I ain't really never had shit
Pull up on sixes have the haters on that mad shit
Bitches wanna taste me, say I look tasty
Yo mama wanna rape me, haters wanna erase me
Niggas scared to face me, all my niggas hittas man
Just copped me a ruger man, y'all gon make me shoot a man
Riding through the hood bitches yelling out "you the man"
Go into the booth and just change like superman
Marcus got the hammer, Folks is gone nail 'em
Shout out my boy Herb, broski what you gotta tell em

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
What they call me? Young killer Heron
Light a nigga top off, leak him like a tampon
That's I'm a Boss shit, this ain't I'm a boss bitch
Cock off me some thousands, you go in a coffin
Catch you in the dark and clap
Hit you with the largest gat
.44 park it back, you ain't gotta answer
What shorty go as hard as that
Now I'm gonna tell you, nobody other
Under 18 fucking somebody's mother
Leave a grown bitch wishing somebody loved her
Never raw dog I'm using somebody's rubber
I be on the block where you watch for under-covers
We don't rock with the police, we don't call them motherfuckers
Anti-CPD, if you think you flossin' we might cross you; CP3
Running with the cannon do some damage, rest in peace
Shells fuck up your face and visit your wake just to see
Bring a couple cans or two, maybe extra hands to shoot
Case he got some friends to shoot the streets say I'm grimy
Well bitches think I'm handsome too, mami got a baby tech[?]
We could be the handsome crew
Clips the size of dynamite, I'm ready for the title fight
He say he a die for this, fuck it he gon die tonight
40 with a laser, up the paper or you die for pipe
Send him to the after-life, doctors not reviving him
Stupid, you gone die for life, wait how can you die for life
Just know that you gone lie with Christ
Sell a couple bricks now my wrist looks like its mackle ice[?]
Y'all ain't never heard of a shorty this hot
Seen a 120 thou through a 46 shot
Ride up on a nigga block, let the 46 pop
That's a nigga gettin' dropped, bada-boom and his watch
That's 2 birds with 1 stone, if you heard then I'm on
You leave me with 3 now its 2 birds and 1 dome
I gotta eat, so in the street I'm taxin' niggas ass
And I'm a beast so if you want beef I'll max a nigga ass
Bitches love the fact that I'm a rappin' nigga now
And my pockets getting fat now so I'm attractive to bitches now

No Limit
