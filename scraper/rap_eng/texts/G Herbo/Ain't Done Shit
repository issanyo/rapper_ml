[Hook – YGG Tay]
Why you talking like that? You ain’t done shit
Why you walking like that? You ain’t done shit
That little bit of hype, you ain’t done shit
I had business all night, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don’t blow up at the clothes, don’t blow up at the hoes
You ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don't blow up at the fans on Instagram, you ain’t done shit

[Verse 1 – YGG Tay]
Why you acting like that? You ain’t done shit but run your mouth
You ain’t got a car, you ain’t got no money, you ain’t got no house
It’s that Instagram, that Instagram pumping niggas up
Yeah you got her number and you took her out but you ain’t even fuck
You been in DC and Miami once, now you taking trips
Copped an ounce or two, now you running round talking bout some bricks
Fuck out of here, you need to lay down, you need to take a seat
That little bit of shit, I make your life savings times 3 a week
Think I’m lying, go ask the plug ‘fore they boss my team
You known for nothing, we known for fucking and sellin' hella yay
Like I said, you ain’t known for nothing
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t doing shit, we know you bluffing

[Hook – YGG Tay]
Why you talking like that? You ain’t done shit
Why you walking like that? You ain’t done shit
That little bit of hype, you ain’t done shit
I had business all night, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don’t blow up at the clothes, don’t blow up at the hoes
You ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don't blow up at the fans on Instagram, you ain’t done shit

[Verse 2 – Lil Herb]
You ain’t posted on the block, you ain’t out selling blocks, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t putting no ops, [?] hold 30 shots
Forty clean up a block, riding round dirty mops
Fuck a little bit of hoes, now you think you on top
I ain’t cuffing no thots, she only love what I got
Telling me she in love, no you not, she in love with my Nas
Riding four X 6s, Mercades, E way going crazy
And your bitch drew a dick eating babies, sipping Ace, I be lazy
And this Gucci, this Louis, this Prada, Fendi Hermans, and these Robins ain’t shit
That’s these lil niggas problems with stuff in the gram
They want to be famous, not rich
Why you spend all your dough on that bitch, why you ain’t put your bro on that lick
And I’m gone off a four and that crush nigga, pour up some more of that shit

[Hook – YGG Tay]
Why you talking like that? You ain’t done shit
Why you walking like that? You ain’t done shit
That little bit of hype, you ain’t done shit
I had business all night, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don’t blow up at the clothes, don’t blow up at the hoes
You ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don't blow up at the fans on Instagram, you ain’t done shit

[Verse 3 – YGG Tay]
You ain’t done shit, cause you’re lazy nigga, you sleep too much
You went in at twelve, I went in at three, I don’t get enough
Them little bit of lights on high G got your head bent
You ain’t never made a dub with a first, man I really did this
You ain’t touching 36, boy you ain’t cop 1000 Gs
You ain’t talking shit but we all know you a wannabe
If you did do it then it wouldn’t be up for discussion
You know how to lie, other than that, you ain’t good for nothing

[Hook – YGG Tay]
Why you talking like that? You ain’t done shit
Why you walking like that? You ain’t done shit
That little bit of hype, you ain’t done shit
I had business all night, you ain’t done shit
You ain’t done shit, you ain’t done shit
Don’t blow up at the clothes, don’t blow up at the hoes
You ain’t done shit
