[Intro]
Uh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Nigga tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Uh-huh


[Chorus]
Nigga tell me what you done for me
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me

[Verse 1]
My lil' niggas blood thirsty
Yo' lil' niggas blood suckers
I treat mine like blood brothers
They get nothin' but love from me
Pass out all these choppers, watch them cut up like a motherfucker
If you want that beef shit we got all you need like Fuddruckers
Best keep your head up, niggas get wet up
Drop twenty-something hollows in his sweater
Everybody over here totin' Berettas
We'll go twenty-zero if you let us
If you wanna get up, I will whatever
Quit all that talking and bet up
And everybody over here gettin' some money
Shoot 500 and bet up
Herbo who does somethin' for you?
Nobody never
Who gon' take somethin' from you?
Nobody ever
Tell 'em I see you around, get wit' the schedule
If that nigga out of bounds get him together

[Chorus]
Nigga tell me what you done for me
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me

[Verse 2]
Nigga what you done for me?
Never shot no guns for me
You know we do that for fun homie
Leave the house everyday with one on me
Run my block 100 Ps for 200 Gs
Have young niggas buyin' jewelry
Pullin' up in B's
And young nigga you don't owe nothin' to me, I just wanna see you eat
Only make sense I do somethin' for you, niggas ain't do nothing for me
Stack that shit up for a month or two 'til you get comfortable
Probably never tellin' you get comfortable, nigga, I ain't do nothing for free
Nigga tell me what you did for me
Like I said, blow this SIG for me
Or I'm like "Lil' bro, do this bid for me
Go load up that ratchet, nigga
Aye, go swerve this brick in traffic, nigga
When you finished, then go clap a nigga"

[Chorus]
Nigga tell me what you done for me
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Tell me what you done for me
Show me somethin' you done for me
Nigga, what you done for me?
Never got nothing done for me
Never hear no love for me
Never shot no guns for me
