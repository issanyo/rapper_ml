[Intro]
Haaa, G-Herbo, humble beast nigga. RIP all my niggas man

[Chorus]
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone

[Verse 1]
13 I'm in the books, I'm playing basketball
By 16 I'm cool with crooks and lettin' ratchets off
But let's rewind, go back in time, this how it happened ya'll
On the east side of the Chi, straight full of madness ya'll
Straight full of pains, snowstorms and rains
Straight target practice dog
But back to story, me? I was just a shorty
See stayed in the slums, two parent home
But moms that's who was close to me
Pops was cool but I was everything I wasn't supposed to be
In the streets, ditchin' school, murder, drugs around me
Rappin' it just found me, thank God it wasn't the county
Buncha shootouts, lucky that them bullets went around me
God was with me, jumped straight in that water, it ain't drown me

[Chorus]
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone

[Verse 2]
Long live G-Fazo, Vito, Cheeko, C-Mo, Pistol, Kobe, Rock
Blizz, Richie, white folks, cracks, playboy, yeah my broski Capo
The herd is real, the couple of names I didn't say I'm gone and stop
The shit I've been through made me heartless
All my feelin's on this Glock
And damn Cap, we was just ridin' through the town
Smokin' out the pound
30-40 down
Heard that shit, it made me sick
I'm still fresh from out of town
If I'm comin' home to that how I'm supposed to put it down?
They don't understand my struggle
They don't care what I've been through
Kobe they don't know me and you was on the block
Up tweakin' all night right before they hit you
And your moms still calls all the time
Said she wanna hear the tape soon as I get through
And she know what my shit gone do
So she don's mind waiting till a nigga get through
All this shit on my mind and I'm only 19
Can't believe how a nigga get through
Every line that I spit shit true
They like why you ain't drop shit new?
2013 songs I ain't ever even drop man
And me and Cap got some hot shit too
'Member bein' in the stu' all day
At the hood all night on some hot shit too

[Chorus]
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
