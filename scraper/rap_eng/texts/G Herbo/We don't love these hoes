[verse 1 Herb]
I don't love no hoe, that's cause I'm a dog
These bitches call my phone, I don't pick up at all
They want me cause I ball yea bitch I spend it all
Spend money like a boss, I don't shop at the mall
These boys want me to ball, at clubs they want to brawl
But we don't fight at all bro let that 40 off
These bitches on lil herb they love the way I splurge
When she get on my nerves I kick her to the curb
On to another bitch I got her suckin' dick just cause the way I spit come suck a rapper dick, bitch suck a trapper dick I spend them racks for shit six eight the stack I hit and I bet it back I miss
