[Herb]

I'm a EBK nigga and a No Limit Monsta
If you look wrong get ya face knocked of ya
Bitches call my phone cuz me and Fivee did a song
I just tell her come along, make her bust not a problem
If she come along you know squad gotta bone
100 niggas do her wrong then she might need a doctor
Squad get it on, Essex block that's my home
Check the VitoCity vlog, you see lights, helicopters
Fuck the police cuz we runnin these streers
You might see me on the ave totin pipes with the rastas
Mally he a rasta, Mally he'll blast
If Mally spot ya, sorry but he got ya
We ridin smoking ganja
Lurkin for the oppas
RIP ROC, posted with the 50 choppa
Shoutout 50 shot
Bullets make him diddy bop
We pull up on any block
And we let them semis spark
We got the city hot cuz we young niggas wildin
Buy alotta poles, we addicted to the violence
Pull up on the set, shootin techs with the silence
Bitch nigga won't hear shit, but the sirens
Skeet off, drop the heat off
Tell her hold a deep jaw till my meat soft
Whip started self up like a default
Pull up on him, all white with the see saw
Like a rich nigga, 17 worth 6 figures
Squad making noise lotta niggas tryna get with us
Keep a small circle cuz he might be a snitch nigga
Team no talking, big poles for a bitch nigga
Catch me on the road doing shows, tryna get richer
Or might be with a Folly boy shooting at a brick nigga
Everybody killing, middle fingers to a bitch nigga
Free lil Webb on gang, thats my lil nigga
