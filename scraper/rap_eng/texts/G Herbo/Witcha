[Intro: Lud Foe]
KidWond3r, you made this beat? dang
Gang, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, ayy

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm that nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who gun bigger
That nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who guns bigger

[Verse 1: Lud Foe]
You see me in the club flexin', I bought all the ones
You ask marks, you YSN, we got all the guns
Fuck the plug, we rob him blind, we need all the funds
My bitch a drug trafficker, she make all the runs
That bitch ain't bad then I won't fuck her, she out of lucker
I know she plottin' on my duffle, I'm not a sucker
Put this dope right in my engine, it got the muscle
High speed, the police see us, they eat my dust up
Lethal weapon on me, Danny Glover, my chopper Russia
She got ass, get it from her mother, I serve her brother
Eight balls off white, 'cause I'm a hustler
My kilo saran-wrapped, my dope smothered
In my trap I take catnaps, I'm no sleeper
Nigga fuck your plug, shop with me, and get it cheaper
Smokin' on some potent reefer, you smoke sativa
Bitch I'm ballin', fuckin' on the cheerleaders

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm that nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who gun bigger
That nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who guns bigger

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I'm that nigga that'll make your life a decision, if I say, they hit you
You ain't never think fo'nem was gon' get up with you, 'til the whip up itchin'
Wake up, reel a nigga, go fishin'
We gon' kill a nigga on prison
But we got on gloves and shit when we get at you
So ain't gon' none of that shit be a mystery
On the block, 2010, we was hustlin', tastin' two
Yeah we was servin' that bitch like Mystikal
I was tryna tote that bitch like igloo
Ran up the sack and I bought a lil stick or two
Dope got the fiend eyes yellow like Pikachu
I ain't gon' lie, I popped a perc and I'm itchin' too
Done fucked on all you lil niggas' bitches too
And we'll shoot at all you niggas too
I'm that nigga, we been them niggas
Whack a nigga, roll that shit up, we finna get pit up
Big ass whips, we smokin' bumpers, used to be a swisher
You don't wanna see mask hop out that Hummer
Everybody gon' miss you, now he just a picture
Hop don't count, you was in the bounty, had to learn your literature
Your bitch was out here suckin' dick, she's a tongue twister
Tryna give me the bad ring, I'm not the mister
Made her put everything in her name, and it's mister tricked her

[Chorus: Lud Foe]
I'm that nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who guns bigger
That nigga, I hang with killers and drug dealers
Pussy nigga don't make me get up with you, I come and get you
Four-five-four nigga, them bullets hit you
I hang around wig splitters who guns bigger
