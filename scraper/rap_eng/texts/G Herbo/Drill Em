[Hook: Homey High Deff]
Chi-Town home of the rough niggas
Keep something for you fuck niggas
False flagging or caught lacking will get your ass clapped up wit em
Got something for you tough niggas
HD set it up with them
High Deff he a D-boy we some savages that'll buss with him

[Verse 1: Homey High Deff]
I'm riding round with the MAC on me
Real shit move back phony
Goofy mark don't fuck around
Have the bullets spraying like Axe on him
Set him off all blacked down
Don't come back till he clapped down
Drive back by the crime scene
Niggas laughing blowing pack out
I was 5TH Grade pulling MACs out
Make a nigga pull that scratch out
Snatch him up
Make a call
Have his bitch lead us to the stack house
Man niggas got age fucked up
Blowing kush I'm so stuck
Hit a nigga for a brick
In the SK now finna post-up
I'm AG repping wild wild
Backwoods help me calm down
Won't even roll reggie up if these shits smoking so loud
I'm the illest spitting in Chicago
Nonstop we the mob ho
Fuck up put a brick on ya have your ass missing by tomorrow
Foul B's every other nigga opp
City to city give me every block
Young boys in training next generation foul never stop
Trynna poke me and get burnt up
For this money I earned bruh
Lay a motherfucker down
Put him on the ground
Now he can't turn up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm sick and tired of these fuck niggas
So I went and bought a 30 40 and a 50
Broski told me better keep it on ya when you by your lonely
I'm the hottest in the city
I'm like fuck it tell them come and get me
You know I'm on the A-block
Broski pull up with the chopper and the enemy red beam catching face shots
Uhhhh
Broke as fuck I rememeber I was
Now all these hunnits on me fifties on me spend them on drugs
Damn you fake I see you a snake
So I don't show no niggas love
And you know I'm coming with 150 niggas if you ever bring me in your club
We popping bottles and throwing stacks and better not no nigga mug
We step outside and you might get hit up by like 4 different guns
And I told yall niggas can't control my niggas
Already rolled them and they ain't made for nothing
Me and HD smoking on OG pouring on that codeine fuck

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Homey High Deff]
On a G keep a sack on me
By the end keep a gat on me
Foul bitch nigga nonstop shit everyday till they wack homie
Fuck niggas don't think about em
Scratch em out and won't think about em
Zip of thrax
Lot of wood
Me and folks then go and drink up out em
I don't give a fuck about a nigga gang
Me and my niggas different things
Once niggas start focusing on money start seeing better change
Yall lame suckas better grow up
Non stop got it sold up
Yeah some niggas gon hate but it's cause all they bitches know us
I be smoking out and getting poured up
Piss poor now I'm that nigga
Best friend was a cap peeler
She's real motherfuck rap nigga
Trynna poke me and get burnt up
For this money I earned bruh
Lay a motherfucker down
Put him on the ground
Now he can't turn up
