They wanna know who run the city, first you askin'

[Verse 2]
Bitch I spazzed out, 'bout half a mil and a stash house
I'm 'bout to cash out, count to much money and pass out
But if i passed out and miss on a dolar, you assed out
Them hollows blasted out, we trench for your ? to a glass house
We gon' bag em up, body, tag em up, take the trash out
I'm addin' up, all I add is up but don't got enough
I'm tatted as fuck, bro go grab a dutch, let's get high as fuck
I'm high as fuck but I ain't high enough, let's get high enough
Couple sluts, tryna see wassup, say they ridin' up
You know what's up, you ain't tryna suck 'n' you can't hang with us
I'm hangin' up, ain't no shamin' us that's the gang with us
Don't play with us bitch we dangerous, keep them things with us
In case they tryna aim at us my youngins let them play ?
They can't bang with us, the better of just smoking that angel dust
That's some silly shit, I'm 'bout to buy a milli clip
Get on that acrobatic shit, bitch we flippin' any whip
L's

[Chorus]
They wanna know who run the city, first you askin'
But I know they Lil Herb and Bibby, that's who cashin' (bitch)
In the clubs they hear me, all the thugs they name me
Your bitch love to lick me, but I just love the ?
And I'm cashin'
The money come, the money go I hunt for more I'm cashin' (x2)
Mo money mo I'm cashin' (x2)
Mo money mo my money long your money low I'm cashin'
