[Verse 1: Cdot Honcho]
In a coupe with them autos in em
Each one got them hollows in em
So when I pull up on ya block
And let the Mac spark
Better hope that his god be with em
My eyes low cause I'm smoking on kill
I ain't lacking bet I'm gripping on steel
Plus I heard niggas plotting on me
Run up on me and his scalp getting pealt
Run up on me and them rounds getting spilled
Run up on me and his crown getting filled
Lil bro posted with the 50 shot
Catch a opp on our block and bananas getting pealt
On the real niggas ain't on shit
Pull up watch his wig get split
Roll a dub while I'm off this big six
Then I hit the club, prolly pay a bitch rent
But I never give a stupid bitch shit
I just give her every inch of this dick
Then I bail out blunts get lit
Flame up tell a bitch get lost
And I'm throwing bullets nigga get mossed
All my young niggas wild letting semis off
Take em down 30 rounds that'll get em off
Smoke sum dope out the pound then I sleep it off

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Yeah Glocks with choppers we got plenty of em
We over east if you want smoke, pull up on yo block and that 50 drumming
On the Essex block with a roll on me and this 4-0 come and get you something
Call lil bro, a nigga want war? Fuck the PoPo we don't give em nothing
Why you think I call my nigga 60 shot? He gone tote for me, he gone keep em coming
Them No Limit Boys a pull on any block, saying fuck Rock, better pick a gun up
We riding round and we got em on us
Run up on you now my niggas one up
Glock with choppers, lurking till the sun up
Hollows in them 50's don't get burnt up

[Verse 3: Cdot Honcho]
And you know my niggas in them Range Rovs
Sipping strait drop with them long poles
Hit the block with them Glocks cocked
Once I send shots watch em lay low
Slugs all in his kangol
Tell my young niggas get his pesos
Homies ask what happen with em
Say them hollows split em cause he ain't go
Next day making sex tapes
While I'm with the bros at yo bitch place
Hit the bitch then forget the bitch
But I left my kids on your bitch face
Drop a nigga then I switch states
And the the car stole so we switch plates
Bezel on me caught yo bitch face
Now she hella on me give my dick space


[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Look.... And don't forget go cop my mixtape
I got bad hoes in another state
They don't know me but know how my dick taste
And I pray to god I never piss test cause I be smoking dope pouring big 8ths
I be leaning but I ain't lacking boy, run up on me , I'ma make this bitch quake
I like Robin Jeans, I like Trues and Fendi
Price of act? I might choose the Remi
30's, 40's, we got Uzis, Semis
Lots of ammo cause we use too many
Hollows clapping if yo goons offend me
Ain't no snitching, we a loose the witness
And all the opps got empty Glocks,
Don't let em tell you that they out here cause them goons pretending


[Verse 5: Cdot Honcho]
Sneak dissing we a wet em up
Send my bitch to go and set em up
Roll up on em let them Nina's bust
When them hollows hit em ain't not gettin up
Bitch I'm leavin while I'm facing blunts
All my niggas Wildin, feelin semis up
Front his move and we gone hit em up
Heard him talking shit shoot em in his tongue
And the pack I'm smoking it be heavy loud never running out I got plenty of it
And my niggas be hella wild shootin hella rounds they plenty of em
Got them 30's and them 40cals
I a take em down and forget about em
Young niggas brought them drummers out
If you running up, give you 50 of em
