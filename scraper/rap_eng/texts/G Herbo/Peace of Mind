[Intro]
Ten. OZ on the Track

Gang
Eyyyyy
I just been feeling different lately man
I been pouring eighths everyday and popping bottles in the stu and shit

[Hook]
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)

[Verse 1]
All I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)
I'm so deep in the streets know some secrets I won't ever tell that could get me some time
Seen so much in my life I got demons in me I don't fight I just keep em inside
Ain't no fear if you seek I won't hide
Hardcore guaranteed I'ma ride
Growing up I had poor nigga dreams just to be on TV shooting threes throwing dimes
Then I learned wait oh no no nigga dreams will chase yours, what I just spent on drink was a dime
Used to live in the slums, dishes all in the sink, none to eat cry and sleep all the time
Now I live in three states and I fly to LA to get high on the beach all the time
And I hate coming back cause when I'm in Chi-raq gotta ride with them  heats all the time
Niggas say they want me all the time (What?)
Lord Father God forgive me for the sins I commit all the time
Gotta load up that clip all the time
I can't repent all the time

[Hook]
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)

[Verse 2]
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
My whole family pray I stay safe everyday they be checking on me all the time
And I swear man I hate seeing tears on their face
Keep two hammers on me all the time
Why it got to be my life at risk everyday?
Type of shit that I think all the time
But it is what it is I'll be fine
Until then I'ma get dollar signs
Niggas killing for Neims and they killing for fame and I'm like
When they gonna get dollar signs?
Used to sleep in the streets didn't see OG for weeks and won't come back until I get dollar signs
And that's by any means for my family to see every meal I'ma miss some of mine
Yeah put that on my life cause that's all I know
When I write I don't fake not a line
Tell myself I'm the truth all the time
Grandma hit me on the phone ask me what I'ma do all the time
Told her just trying to stay out the way cause I think about you all the time

[Hook]
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind (All I really want is peace of mind)
