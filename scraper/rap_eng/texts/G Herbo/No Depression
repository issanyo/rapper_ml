Coulda' got rich, I was 18 had some minor setbacks
Street nigga if I don't do nothin', Ima run that check back
Couple bitches used to play me, now they get the message
You can keep that pussy baby, I'm not interested
Cross my heart hunnid times a day, I know this shit a blessing
Never gave me shit, got up made a way, learned life from all my lessons
I guess more money and more problems, why a nigga stressin'
About no paper I ain't stressin, bitch ain't no depression

[Verse 1]
About no paper I ain't stressin, bitch ain't no depression
I was 16 made 250 off a 14, bought a Smith & Wesson
In the trap house turned it to a 100 when the door ring, gotta stay awake no more lean, walkin' grams trip
Lookin like a zombie from a horror scene, off 4 red and the 4 green
.30 on me, run up and you know what it's gon' be
Spray the boy head like oil sheen
Bitches love to whore me, they adore me, ride me like a horsie
I can't marry you girl you's a coho, been one way before me
Run a big house, bankroll, purse cost 4 g's, know you wanna see my Porsche keys
40 more on the dashboard, homie got a GT so he wanna see how the sport be
Self made like a boss B, never got a advance, never needed y'all to endorse me
Worked hard wasn't shit planned, remember 2010 teacher told me I wouldn't be shit and
If I see that hoe bitch, Ima make her so sick, rollie on my wrist cost a whole brick
They won't ever see it comin, til it's over wit

[Verse 2]
My OG told me "if you want sumn' better get at it and if you fail better keep at it" she'll tell you, "you couldn't get the bag
You was fumbling" sooner or later though, he got it
I thought my destination was straight to the paper, but fuck that
I learned how to re-route it
And you say that it's there but G Herbo just nobody handing it to me, gotta re-count it
And if you want smoke that shit south, better sleep bout it
All that gangsta shit, we bout it, niggas don't wanna see bout it
Actin' like he bout it, ain't show us nothin', so we doubt it
And this watch really made to wear on occasions, but I rock mine on the regular
40 Glock in my Ethika's, don't try no extra stuff, turn that boy meat to a vegetable
I was broke, I was stressin' bruh
Pockets negative, now I got zeros with decimals, commas, I mean
Don't think cause I got the creme, we ain't toting choppas'
With beams
I'm that nigga in Chiraq but I'm not the King, cause I got enough enemies
And I swear baby, you could hold on to that pussy cause it don't mean nothin' to me, no they can't get enough of the G
