[Hook]
I gotta shine bright
All this money on my mind
All I know is grind where I come from
Everyone on the nine tryna come up
All this money on my mind I gotta have it
All the money all the time, I never had shit
You talk about the grind, well I'm on it
All this money on the line, yeah, I want it
I gotta shine, I gotta shine bright
Cause it's my time, I'm in the limelight

[Verse 1]
Hundred days and the nights, I got no sleep
Sixteen, tottin' pipes, fuck the police
I was tryna earn stripes like an OG
Ridin' dirty, no lights, and we four deep
Hot boy, gettin' trapped in the cold streets
Late night, havin' fights with my OG
And I know it wasn't right, but I know me
I gotta eat by any means, I can't go to sleep
Life hard when you young tryna get it
Posted up with my thugs, sellin' drugs and we in it
Summer time on the block, smokin' bud and we sippin'
Hate when my squad lose cause I love when we winnin'
I lost a lot of niggas by the gun in a minute
Now I keep it close, haters won't catch me slippin'
Cause I'mma throw them slugs til I'm finished
Tryna rob me and these slugs goin' with 'em
I remember
Young nigga tryna roll with the biggers
All my niggas real, never roll with pretenders
D's tryna make a livin', gotta get it in the kitchen
I was livin' for the moment, gotta get it or I miss it
All this money, I'mma get it
Never save it, I'mma spend it
Cause it ain't goin' with us, no it ain't goin' with us
I remember days I ain't even make it for dinner
RIP white folks, out there I stay winnin'

[Hook]
I gotta shine bright
All this money on my mind
All I know is grind where I come from
Everybody on the night tryna come up
All this money on my mind I gotta have it
All the money all the time, I never had shit
You talk about the grind, well I'm on it
All this money on the line, yeah, I want it
I gotta shine, I gotta shine bright
Cause it's my time, I'm in the limelight

[Verse 2]
To everybody said I ain't gonna make it
Tryna bring me down
I'm countin' hundreds, I know you hate me now
And I just wanna see your faces now
Cause all your bitches on my dick, tryna take me down
But I can't go, give a fuck about a stank ho
She only want me cause I'm young with a bankroll
Money come and money go
But I can't give my money to a money hungry ho
You know that
Yeah I'm still MOB, gotta quote that
But I used to be broke, that's a throwback
Now I walk up in the store like I want that
Did a lot up in the past, I don't want backs
But I want you to think like a Kodak
Catch me all white Wraith with the pro black
Middle fingers to a lame, where my boys at
Pull up on my boy (?), where the smokes at?
Roll up that loud
And let it hit my chest to relieve my stress
And I'm high right now
Thinking of a way out cause I believe I'm next
I just gotta stay humble
(?) be strong cause I know I can't fumble
Any nigga wanna rumble
I hold my head high cause I know I'm next

[Hook]
I gotta shine bright
All this money on my mind
All I know is grind where I come from
Everybody on the night tryna come up
All this money on my mind I gotta have it
All the money all the time, I never had shit
You talk about the grind, well I'm on it
All this money on the line, yeah, I want it
I gotta shine, I gotta shine bright
Cause it's my time, I'm in the limelight

[Outro]
All I know is grind where I come from
Everybody on the night tryna come up
All this money on my mind I gotta have it
All the money all the time, I never had shit
You talk about the grind, well I'm on it
All this money on the line, yeah, I want it
I gotta shine, I gotta shine bright
