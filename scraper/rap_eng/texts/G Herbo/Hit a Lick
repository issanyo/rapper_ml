I just hit a lick
All my money come in bricks
Foreign Riding smoking dope (Smoking DOPEEE!)
Getting money that's all I know
(2x)

[Verse 1: King Louie]
I just bumped a bitch
She work at the pharmacy, free drink
That's a lick
I just hit a lick
Gotta move with bands already on E
Talking that big money shit gon' get yo ass stained
Poked, sweet lick
I'mma walking lick
But you would die trying to take shit
Rolling like a bitch
Me and my bitch need more OJ and Fiji
Even though I'm dolo in the car got two burners I'm 3 deep
Pockets full of hundreds
So much dope smoke, I'm smoking that BP
Anti-mid, no 87 only 93
You could be a lick for free
Salute to any nigga that ever hit a lick wit me
Yeah we grew up finessing
Kicking doors and card cracking
Catch a opp nigga lacking
I'm like oooohhh I got action (GRawwww)
Haaaannnn!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I hit licks
Finesse a dope man for six bricks
Finesse a smoke man for six zips
Finesse yo ho make her lick dick
Cause I'm rich bitch
In that foreign drop smoking 2 Chainz
Got my eyes low like I'm Liu Kang
Pocket full of hundreds from a new stain
I'm so used to stunting, that's my new thing
Just bumped me a bitch with a baby by a trap nigga
She don't know I wanna take them duoquets I'm a rap nigga
I'mma tie him up when I know he got the racks wit him
If he act up I don't wait to let the Macs hit em
Plug finna slide on me, know he got them packs with em
Wanna take him now trying to see what I'mma do
Last lick went bad this can't be a number 2
Run up on em no mask fuck it what I got to lose
Money or the fame either one I gotta choose
Ball hard wit the squad
Get money, fuck fame
Still do the same stuff. stand down, flame Up
Pull up in a new range, now your ho bussed gang
I'll never change up, I'mma gang banger
Ride thru the 8 block, then your life in danger
Posted on the east side smoking on Jamaica
You can keep the 31 I don't do the pacers
