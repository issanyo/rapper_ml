They call me Big Bucks, so you know I got racks
And I always been at the trap and I be fuckin bitches off rap
And I done put my team on the map
In them clubs throwing them stacks
Stashing out get it right back
Damn I coulda spent that at Saks
Shit like that make me think back
Like "Damn, I coulda bought a brick"
My pockets super fat got me lookin like a walkin lick

And I wipe my nose with a hundred dollars
