[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Herbo G that youngin and I love stuntin, pockets full of hundreds
Got my 40 on me, please don't run up on me, boy don't be no dummy
Ion got no bitch or no relationships cause I'm in love with money (I'm in love with bands)
On the E-Way drinking lean this summer Forgiatos doing a hundred
All these bitches over me, I fucked her once and now she on my bumper
I gave yo bitch my number and now that bitch she won't stop calling me for nothing
At the top smoking dope thinking how I started off with nothing
And ain't no nigga hand me shit therefore I don't owe nobody nothing
Self made nigga can't compare to you help made niggas
Biting Herbo swag got me feeling like I helped made niggas
Why you hating on me and you pocket watching get yo self paid nigga
I see you looking at me but that plotting just gone get yo self slayed nigga

[Hook]
Bitch I ball out
Sip codeine til I fall out
Smoke OG to the face when I wake tell em ball out
Yo bitch like Herbooo
We got racks in the stash, bring em all out
Ima hustler, tell my bitch mind ya business, watch y'all mouth
But watch me ball
Watch me ball
Ball
Bitch watch me ball (Swish)
Watch me ball
Ball
Bitch watch me ball (Swish)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I know a lot of niggas hating on me waiting for my downfall (You's a fuck nigga)
Fuck niggas stay away from me I can't be around y'all
I know niggas snakes they ain't really real I know niggas plotting on me
And that's why I got it on me, read yo body language, no you not my homie
And I got them racks on me, out in traffic with them glizzys, macs on me, ova east on the E-Way if you looking for me, bitch I'm getting off on stony
Pull up on the opps, do a hit and hop on stony
Go and feed yo bitch now she sucking dick while I flip it down on stony
In the kids station roll some dutches up while I sip these double cups
While I'm blowing hundreds bitch I'm stacking hundreds all my money double up
A nigga run up on me, fill him up with hollows make his body bubble up
Them no limit boys love to ball so so the hoes in love with us

[Hook]
