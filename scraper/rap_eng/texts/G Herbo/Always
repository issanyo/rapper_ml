[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Always do a bitch wrong that's always
Fuck her, kick her out man that's always
All this money on me, bitch that's always
Pull up in that foreign, bitch that's always
Always... Always...
Gotta get this money, man that's always
Trappin', stretchin' work, bitch that's always
Flexin' on these goofies, bitch that's always

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Coolin' in the trap, gettin' high off that gunsmoke
Niggas sneak diss and imma show 'em what my gun fo'
Lot of rappers actin' remind me of CB4
But I be gettin' money and I don't need to see you folk
Yo' bitch text me, I don't know why you wit her tho
She suck my dick in the morning and ate me like some Cheerio
Turn that bitch around and beat it like my stereo
I be movin' work my plug come from Mexico
I remember sellin' coke, posted by the liquor sto'
Work for niggas, I ain't sellin' packs no mo'
Now I pull up to the trap, big bags like I'm Santa Clause
Now they like Fredo damn what the Phantom cost

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I be high off zips. Sippin pints, drinkin' codeine always
Pour 6 off in my Sprite I been leanin' all day
Woke up tryna fuck yo' bitch cause I know she call late
Always make her suck this dick until her jaws ache
Hit the trap already got fiends waitin' in the hallway
Tryna rob 4-4 hawk 'em down nigga that's a dog chase
Bulldog only hold 6 shots, but he got red beam for a nigga
Fredo in the cut wit the 30 he gon' give everythin to a nigga
Let the choppa sing to a nigga
Mask up cause I know my name ring to them niggas
No Limit that's the team, them my niggas
Always sippin' lean countin' figures
Always got the gat always spendin' money
Always get it back
My bitch told me I'm always in the trap
She talk always, she always gettin slapped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Capo]
They like Cap why you spend that money like that, that's always
I remember 6217 came out runnin' 'round pissin' (in) dem hallways
And if you wanna smoke fuck nigga you can get it the hard way
Gotta ride with my Glock
Gotta give a nigga shots
If I see dem opps that's always
And shoutout to Zaytoven
Ain't get my earrings yet
Or my watch, but til then my neck frozen
Aye look bitch, I'm holdin'
Where you get that bag from, shit look fake
Yo lil dirty ass stole it
And Yo boyfriend ain't no friend of mine
Can't smoke weed with him and his homies
No his ass ain't no kin of mine
Top from your bitch that's always
Somebody poppin' out the club
This Doowop with a mop and he spark in broad day

[Hook]
