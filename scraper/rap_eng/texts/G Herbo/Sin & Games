[Intro]
Aye, aye now on some real shit though, man
It's, it's like Chicago is just a lifestyle that you know what I'm sayin' a lot of people not used to but we adapted to it
Like I'm 20 years old, I know I know probably at least 50 people dead, like personally that I know like dead or not
You know what I'm sayin'
On the day to day basis this shit not regular

[Hook]
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babys catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the gang, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we play

[Verse 1]
Illinois, Chi, Eastside I was raised
Roamin' outside spendin' most of my days
Grade school, just a young nigga with a heart in 'em
And ain't none bigger
And some other young niggas with me ready for whatever
All I tell 'em 'go and get 'em thuggin', hustlin'
Shed a tear, shoulda make his blood brothers like I was born with 'em
Took a long, long time love to see my niggas shine
Fought a storm with them,  a couple gone on the ride
They ain't seen outside a long, long time
Somewhere at the wrong time, prolly too much on they mind
Tryna homicide, other half gone now
God called him home while mama is traumatized
And that's why we all quit the chains niggas
One time back again the wall
Lettin' pistols off with the same niggas, sit with me floor seats
Tryna draw a piece, at the ball games kickin'
State to state on the planes trippin'
Kobe died we was pain sippin'
Thinkin' how we used to hang with him

[Hook]
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babys catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the game, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we play

[Verse 2]
'Member when I used to write rhymes on the Microsoft
Record lyrics on the trap flip 'fore I ever touched a microphone
Young nigga, like 15 granny livin' in the warzone
Naw I ain't talkin' Hot cars, boy I had to take a striker home
I ain't gon' lie was frightened, but I had it right by my side, I'ma let it off always
Walkin' inside with that bitch in my hand with no lock on the door and no light in the hallway
One thing for certain, I know that my killers lurkin'
Wake up, they flip it through all day
Go catch a fuck nigga lacking like always
Hop out the whip pull out the clip in broad day
Ain't no regrets 'cause all the shit we did, we did it our way
Can't trust niggas, fuck these niggas I learned that the hard way
And all the niggas that's with me they ridin' like a Harley
.40 in that old school, it ride like a 'Rari

[Hook]
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babies catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the game, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we play
