[Intro]
I'm so hot nigga
I'm so high nigga

[Verse]
G Herbo, I'm some hot nigga
Before I started rap I used to pop niggas
Maskey told me "Lil bro chill out cause you got hitters"
Get this money and we gon' be at the top with you
But you still can catch be up on Essex block nigga
Smoking dutchies and Murch Money got that Glock with him
We No Limit, that's 150, we got all the bitches
They niggas hating that's the reason they want problems with us
All the new opps, they don't know us
Lil Herb don't rap beef, nigga blow somethin'
And you might catch me by my lonely, I'mma keep it on me
Check the news, I heard somebody went to sleep for Kobe
And I'm leaning right now, bitch, I'm sipping codein
I been the same, I been gangbanging since I been a shorty
I been fucking grown bitches since I been a shorty
Run through that check like last month forgot I spent a sawdy
I went through a hundred thousand that's without a deal
I'm 18 and I don't give a fuck about a deal
People ask me all the time, "You on the block for real?"
Sometimes I stay up in the crib cause fo' n 'em down to drill
And they ain't shooting for no legs, fo' n 'em tryna' kill
If I put them shooters on yo' ass then you dying for real
And bitch, I'm always in the field, Roc Block where you find me
15 hundreds in my jeans, all my jewelry shinin'
30s in them .40s all my niggas slidin'
Riding through the opps, all them niggas hidin'
Don't let them tell you that they out there, man, them niggas lyin'
Met some of them niggas and free all my niggas doing time
Matter fact free G Gills
He doing 20 in the feds cause he didn't squeal
Free Bruce, free Breezy ho
Free Slick and Crazy James, they some demons ho
Vito City, that's the team low
Pistol gang, yeah, we keep them hoes
Glizzies with them 30s and them beams low
Run up on us and we squeezing ho
Lil Bro too trigger happy, he gon' squeeze some mo'
Bitches wait in line for pictures when I leave my shows
Only got a couple minutes, take a couple flizzicks
Finesse a bitch right to the trunk and now she sucking dizzick
After I get what I wanted you gotta do fo' n 'em
She told me that she ain't want to, said she that she don't know them
You don't wanna turn up bitch, you don't know me anyway
You ain't tryna top off bro n 'dem get out on the E-way
All my niggas, we be running bitches like a relay
Sucker niggas beefing over bitches, we can't relate
Why you mad at me my nigga? That bitch pussy funky
You buy her all type of shit and I don't give her nothing
She probably like the way a nigga stuntin'
Thumbing through these twenties, fifties, hundreds
This shit ain't nothing, man, I'm still a youngin'
And I never been a stain, run up on me and I'm drummin'
Never catch me with no lames, all my niggas goblins
All I hang with hustlers, killers, robbers
You a lame, tuck your chain, my lil' shorties starving
We got aim, don't get banged, you a fuckin' target
Kobe Squad, that's what we are
Six forties riding round, we in 3 cars
Flipping through they set, where them niggas at?
Caught a body last night, I'on have no time for that
And bro n 'dem still lurking, still creeping ho
Off lean, they off xans but they ain't sleeping though
Tryna' catch another body like a week ago
Forgot about that other body, we been drinking ho
Leaning ho, all I sip is codeine lil ho
Get my dicked sucked for Kobe while I drink a 4
And if you tryna' catch feelings then you tweakin' ho
Ball like I'm Kobe on the way I'm tired of speaking ho
Gang

[Outro]
NLMB, 150 Roc Block shit, man, you already know how I'm rockin', man
