[Intro]
Yeah
G Herbo
You already know what it is, man, you know what the fuck it is
Soon as the beat come on instant kill, body
Homicide on the beat
I feel like Juelz mixed with Wayne
Mixed with Kiss mixed with Styles
Mixed with motherfucking Cam and Puff
Puff cause I'ma talk that shit
Mixed with Pac and Biggie, Hov
Everybody hol' on
Look... Look...

[Verse]
I tell 'em look when I got 'em shook
Before I kill him when I gotta kill him
Since a infant I had been that nigga, word to Auntie Linda
I was too gangsta for a Gerber boy
I had Gerbert on them Polaroids
If you can get the picture
I wasn't rich I had to risk it, try and glit my wrist up
Went for a bitch, it wasn't shit for me to get my dick sucked
I fucked bitches look like Kylie Jenner but they lips way thinner and don't go on dinners
I did my shit so I repent if I was born a sinner
I ball hard and rock fox furs in the winter
2000 I go spend on Mike Amiri Denim
This that shit A Boogie rap about yeah them my niggas
They say Don dropped a new check while he getting bigger
And I'm the type of nigga that follow my intuition I shoot you, you get to twitching
I gotta kill or you might get to snitching
You niggas bitches had to man up and take gifts off of Christmas lists
Ain't go to school I was skipping, ditching, I didn't listen
I started pitching had experiments up in the kitchen
Trying not to breath in I thought it felt like we was sniffing
Re-up we thought we was tripping profits started tripling
We got this bitch sewed up from Stony to Lake Michigan
If he toting sumn' we like "so what?" when we face off, lift his soul up, got big shit when you pullin out they like "hol' up"
Mini choppers that fold up like a Lamborghini with the doors up
Inna fast car G Swervo in the V12 and before I leave the house, pick that pole up
Roll up
I seen niggas froze up, had they homie oozing on the ground left for dead cause they ain't do what they said
Im just on the bread, niggas ain't worth shit I walk alone instead
I don't know who want me dead eyes behind my head
I had spent in Neiman Marcus what was on my head
They wanna get me out outtie I'm just getting older
And I don't take for granted pray I get it lower
They keep moving low profile presidential like a soldier suppose to
Make the best of ups and downs in life, like a rollercoaster
Know my grandma looking down on me shining like I'm suppose to
Know your baby getting older and I'm getting older
Sorry my heart getting colder niggas getting ho-er but I know you see I did all that I said that I was gonna uh
Made all of the sacrifices even when I ain't wanna uh
Momma living out 5 outta 4 some, I was somewhere like 100 floors up
Ran up a quarter mill on a tour bus, Rollie my wrist, Wraith to M6
Early I was fucking off checks in and shit, you ain't know young niggas getting reckless like this
Any nigga that diss me on a record and shit and spit facts
They lying on wax
Homies rolling over, I need a stash house spot, money rolling over
I been that shit since Avirex, Motorolas
And I cleaned up like Ajax, call the corner clean
Pull up Maybach shorties call the corners
Kid ain't have no clean summers we was always warring
I ain't have no clean sneakers cause I always wore em'
And stop getting good grades I was in the hallwayâ€‹ more
When my class walked across the stage I was in California, smoking California
Ain't have to get up early mornings, fuck Tom Joyner
Shout out Neno I was fucking with M Tray when they was the New Orleans Hornets
