[Intro: clip from "Reservoir Dogs"]
"All he had to do was say my dad's name, but he didn't
He kept his fucking mouth shut and he did his fucking time, and he did it like a man
He did four years for us
So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin' me this very good friend of mine
(HERBO IS THAT YOU?)
Who did four years for my father?"

[Verse 1: Zuse & Lil Herb]
Catch a nigga with a choppa, choppa
All my partners 'bout the guala, guala
Look at me, look at me, shotta, shotta
You a pussy boy, call the boy Mufasa
Dipping your head in spaghetti lobster
Ja-Rule these niggas no holla, holla
They know that I lead and these niggas follow
Kill a nigga and won't feel no sorrow
Catch a nigga, won't see you tomorrow
Stand over a opp fill him up with hollows
Money over bitches, that's the motto
Jackpot like I just won the lotto
Glock 40 and a semi auto
Smokin', sippin' out the Remy bottle

[Chorus: Lil Herb & Zuse] x2
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell, heaven or hell
Dead or jail, dead or in jail, dead or in jail

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Probably lost money, my mind, my time
Man, I done lost guys to this street shit
I go hard and I grind for mine and people who said I wouldn't be shit
I can't fuck with niggas, I don't trust a soul, gotta stay on my defense
Got my Glock everywhere that I go
Give me a reason, I'm squeezin
G Herbo and Zuse, real niggas and killas from Chiraq to Kingston
Bring my nigga Zuse to Chiraq to post up with them killas on Kingston

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: Zuse]
I made it out the fucking hood, these niggas know that ain't a secret
Ya know I gotta keep them bitches on me but I gotta keep them on the leashes
Shittin' on them, call me feces
Caught me a opp in the bleachers
Herbo with me got the pieces
Mac 11 on me, you know I'mma breeze it
Send a bitch to kill you, who you gon' sleep with?
Hollow to your face, I know you gon' eat it
Catch a nigga and ain't gon' do it discretely
I'mma catch your man, I know he won't peep it

[Hook] x2

[Verse 4: Lil Herb & Zuse]
Is you a killer or not?
We be ridin' through blocks and we drillin' a lot
I love seeing them drop
Watch his body in shock while he feelin' the shots
Me no labba, make you disappear
Tell them "abracadabra!", shoot you with choppa
Bullet bite you like a whopper, catch him on the blocka

[Hook] x2

[Outro: news clip]
"There was a count of causalities that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq
But it was here in Chicago
A place some have dubbed 'Chiraq'..."
