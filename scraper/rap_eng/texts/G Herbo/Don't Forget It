[Verse 1]
People judge and they outcast what they don't understand
The state don't care why you was crossing borders with them grams
Nobody gon' support your daughter, ain't gon' feed your fam
And ain't no jobs for you but you ain't gon' starve, are you?
I come from the slums, none but murder, drugs
All the mothers addicts, all the daddys thugs
I rise above that
But all my people fuck with this so I show I love back
I ain't forget where I come from and I shed blood at
It's tatted on me nigags right know where my hood at
And it wouldn't mean shit if I can go back where I'm good at
I'm by the cornerstore where Lil Roc caught that slug at
And matter fact my nigga birthday just was yesterday
You, Kobe, Cap was on the block feel like it was yesterday
Can't forget about my niggas cause I miss my niggas
Way before this rap shit, every day I was with my niggas

[Hook]
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh

[Verse 2]
Now when I reflect on my past life it keep me humble
Help me balance out in my fast life
Woke up with no heat, no gas, middle of December
Mom's boiling bath water nigga I remember
I ain't even liked baths but I couldn't take showers
30 minutes, getting the water hard at school late at hour
Now I'm in the towers, pool by the shower
Smoking out the pound, always smell like sour
I hit the ground a 100 days forreal
And my shit is still ain't over
150 Dream Team, I'm tryna run that bitch like Hova
Always remind myself, not to get beside myself
If this rap shit fucked me over, I'd be right back on that sofa
In that trap on 78th street fucking up that baking soda
No sleep, when I hear police gotta make it out the backdoor with the toaster
But them days ain't take me over
Now when I'm in a plane looking down tryna see what state we over

[Hook]
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
