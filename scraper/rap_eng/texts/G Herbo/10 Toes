[Intro]
Aviators
(Damn, Bobby made this?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Trav]
I never trip off a bitch, let my man fuck
I caught an opp in this net, I said and 1
10 toes down, my niggas'll stand up
Them niggas pussy, ain't puttin' no fear in us
I feel like Pac, these niggas fearin' me
Fuck it, I be ridin' on my enemies
Them niggas pussy, ain't puttin' no fear in us
10 toes down, my niggas'll stand up

[Verse 1: Trav]
My niggas slide through, (?) shit
Go on, hot-cold like freezers
If you fuck my bitch, better keep her
I drink that lean by the liter, no Karo
Shooters shoot when I say so
Killers with me on the payroll
100 round out the Draco
South side down in Fazo
Niggas know I don't play bro
Fingers itchin' when the trigger hit
Spin motherfuckers like a (?)
Head shot, cuff
Boom this, tuck
We don't, no talk
We don't really do no talkin'
Homicide so often
Shootouts in Slauson
Ask niggas out in Compton
They'll tell you I'm a problem
Lately I've (?) sippin' on the dutch
I called my first spot when I seven, (?)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Pussy boy know he don't put no fear in us
We at the table, eatin' your lunch if you ain't here with us
Young nigga feelin' like I'm Pac, I'm bout to hit 'em up
Got shorties with me totin' Glocks and they don't give a fuck
Ridin' round with them sticks on us
Sippin' lean, got the K on us
Couple pounds, half a brick on us
Everybody got bodies, (?) is on us
No will tat, no tip drums
Just go up, go crazy on the opps
And go up, go crazy on the opps
Everyday non-stop, goin' crazy on the opps
Yeah these fuck niggas know they better not play with No Limit gang
Since we lost Fazo, Kobe, Roc, this shit ain't been the same
No, them lil chain shots ain't enough, we tryna hit his brain
Got east coast beef, called, tried to put 'em on that picture frame nigga

[Hook: Trav]
