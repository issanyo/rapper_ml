[Verse 1: Dave East]
If you heard it from me, you oughta know it's the truth
I'm Dominican, play the Cuban when I go in the booth
Hustle and flow, all I did was hustle and sell
From the trap straight to XXL, I shoulda been here
Cigar smoke, Valentino designer swimwear
Eating swordfish, Balenciaga, like ten pair
Fashion talk, reminiscin' when I had to walk
First Ave to Lenox, handle business, knock the package off
I told Nas I got the Prezi 'fore the album drop
Sour got me zonin' really thinking what got Malcolm shot
Basquiat when it comes to art, you lyin' still
Lookin' for The Wiz when it come to heart, I won't buy it
If you a man, know that men stand up
Like my mother's mom fell, I had to pick grams up
Sports, drugs, and entertainment made me hit Cam up
I'm in Bermuda with a cougar gettin' my tan up, Harlem

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
G Herbo, you know me
I guess that I'm a freshman now but I've been an OG
It's okay 'cause all my life it's been someone before me
It always takes someone to step up, say I'm one and only
I just been rollin', smokin', let 'em off and kill 'em softly
I used to rap for fun but now I'm gettin' guacamole
Niggas wan' know me, bitches wan' stop and blow me
Haters wan' see me clapped up, leave a nigga holey
I watched them shells hit his back up, let 'em kill him slowly
Them hollows'll straighten his act up, leave a nigga Holy
Hallelujah, disrespect me, boy, I gotta do ya
I ride with shooters, got 'em shooting and still, Iâ€™m a shooter
Don't do it, look, in 2015, all I did was get cream
Every other day 10K, like MJ, I need six rings
You foul-ass niggas hate but that shit ain't working
Went down my first year in the finals just like Kyrie Irving
Dropped out of school, ain't take no finals, I was smokin' Urban
Hopped out the van with fo nem reeking that's that nigga Herb and
Catch me in homeroom sleeping I was off the syrup and
I kept a pocket full of faces they knew I was swervin'
Police in my city racist stopped me on the curb and
Question me, start makin' accusations of my character
Ask why I carry so much money nigga this America
Diamonds shining, chains on tryna' add my karats up
Know they daughter love my music, fuck around and marry her
Tryna put me in a cell man them white folks scared of us
I got them white folks on me now, them white folks takin' care of us
Vito, Fazo on me, nah, white folks told me nah
My homies tatted on me, I told Kobe hold me down
Two 40's one for me, and Cap that's when I roll around
Just stay lowkey I don't wanna have to- nobody down
