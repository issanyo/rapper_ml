[Chorus: Key Glock]
Young nigga eatin', uh, bon appetit, uh
Messed up Halloween, what, pull up, trick or treat, yuh
Nigga, ain't shit sweet, uh, fuck 'round and get sweeped, yuh
I don't play with freaks, uh, bitch, I play for keeps, duh
Real dope dealer, uh, foreign car drifter, yeah
Real go getter, uh, and a cop killer, yeah
Posted like a center, uh, Lord knows I'm a sinner, yeah
Benjamins for dinner, yuh, money hungry nigga, yeah

[Verse 1: Z Money]
A money hungry nigga, Benjamins for dinner
Got money on my mental, when you cook it, cook it gentle
No, this is not no rental, Mercedes, the car got sensors
Your bitch say that she missin', just stuck my dick in her dental
Re-rockin' fundamental, it's simple, just stay consistent
I was born a hitter, whippin' got my arm [?]
Fuckin' foreign bitches and it's got some diamonds in it
Finest of the blickys, got a whole 50 in it
Hit me, trap house spendin', got a whole semi in it
Droppin' off the bales and pickin' up, got money in it
Flashy with my pendant like a chandelier in mansion
Come get your one shot, tryna shake your hand 'cause I'm not friendly

[Chorus: Key Glock]
Young nigga eatin', uh, bon appetit, uh
Messed up Halloween, what, pull up, trick or treat, yuh
Nigga, ain't shit sweet, uh, fuck 'round and get sweeped, yuh
I don't play with freaks, uh, bitch, I play for keeps, duh
Real dope dealer, uh, foreign car drifter, yeah
Real go getter, uh, and a cop killer, yeah
Posted like a center, uh, Lord knows I'm a sinner, yeah
Benjamins for dinner, yuh, money hungry nigga, yeah

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Too rich, a young nigga, this 1920, they tryna lynch me
Who the fuck he think he is? Take a brand new Rollie, put diamonds in it
I make that much in 10 years, you spent that on Balenciaga denim
Brand new Bentaygas in 'em, 10k with my jogger in 'em
I made 10k in my joggers, closet hid a whole bunch of Robbins in 'em
And we ain't with none of that flodgin', flex 'round here, we robbin' in 'em
My brother pop out late night like Batman, used to be Robin with him
Still got the Skydweller, .40 Glock in my left hand, brain cuckoo, need a CAT Scan
24 in the clip, me and Lil Ku in the brand new coupe with the SN
And spent the coupe on a brand new crib, went to sleep, bought that bitch a [?]
Yeah, you blue 'cause your bitch took a picture here, so for sure she was showin' up pressin'
Best invest in a vest on them bitches, fly around his chest them, I just move 'em, finesse with

[Chorus: Key Glock]
Young nigga eatin', uh, bon appetit, uh
Messed up Halloween, what, pull up, trick or treat, yuh
Nigga, ain't shit sweet, uh, fuck 'round and get sweeped, yuh
