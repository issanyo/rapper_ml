[Verse 1: G Herbo/Lil Herb]
I know niggas that's getting' money
I got young niggas that'll steal it from 'em
You fuck niggas ain't gettin' money
Perpetrators make me sick to my stomach
Foe'nem they'ont chit chat
They just run up on you and they get to bussin'
On our block, we don't go for nothin'
Fuck the cops, we came up from hustling
Where I'm from, It's a lot of niggas say they shot a nigga
But they really bluffin'
Gotta couple niggas in the can now facing fed time
For not saying nothin'
No NEW niggas! Who is YOU nigga? You a FU nigga! I see THROUGH niggas!
Imma hit the club wit' like TWO niggas buss a MOVE nigga, we gone SHOOT niggas!
Balenciaga for the shoe nigga. Automa cost a coupe nigga
[?] told me "gotta get this paper", I look at him like "What else to do nigga?"
I'm the man? Yeah, what else is new nigga?
I just hit the booth and execute niggas
Let the 50 blow at ya crew nigga
Killin' everybody next to you nigga!

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 2]
Damn, Awwwww!
You too fufu man!
Aye, I put that on my mom's that you fufu man!
But me?
Imma hit it harder than a bullet to the temple
With subliminal, straight to the mental
Mountain shrunk down to the size of a thimble
SevenSixSupah make it all so simple
You really wanna learn how to come and get it how a God do?
Wanna build and destroy like I do?
Wanna give, wanna take, wanna build, wanna break?
Wanna see what it means to be powerful?
Gone head, remember yo victims
Aw wait, you ain't pullin' no triggers
And if you really out here gettin' that bag
Why claims being made that you thumpin' through figures?
Nigga what? Nigga, Nigga what?
Bodies get caught more than hands get shook
Nigga what? Nigga, Nigga what?
Maybe you'll stop when yo mans get took
Huffin' and puffin' about that claim
Knowin' that you huff. You ain't bout that claim
Nigga what? Nigga, Nigga what?
What nigga, nigga what?

[Second Hook] x 2
Said the whole year in my back pocket
Sittin' on it like a damn wallet
Shittin' on it like a damn toilet
Man, these niggas they'ont really want it

[Outro: SevenSixSupah]
Imagine lame ass niggas
Whole crew fufu
Wit' a .4 loud pack tryna bow you
Can I get a dollar?
Tryna get a swisher
Always need sumn' err'time I'm witcha
You ball too hard to have bums in the picture
But you so humble you stand right wit' em
And I say, God bless yo heart
But ain't no fufu 'round my spot
