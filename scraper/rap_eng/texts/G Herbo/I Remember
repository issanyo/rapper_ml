[Intro: Cago Leek]
Gannnngggggg
Trapping hard for the money
All that shit, all that shit man
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

[Hook: Cago Leek]
I remember I was trapping hard for the money
I remember all them gun wars in the summer
I remember all them young hoes that was bussing
I remember I ain't have a slug now I'm stunting

I remember I was trapping hard for the money
I remember all them gun wars in the summer
I remember all them young hoes that was bussing
I remember I ain't have a slug now I'm stunting

[Verse 1: Cago Leek]
I remember I was trapping hard for the money
It was in the winter we was selling hard for the money
And my bitches thicker they be cracking cars for the money
Bitch I'm drinking Henny yah my whole bottle look like honey
If I see a enemy inside a party I'm on dummy
Member selling DM, running from the cars when I was coming
Niggas hate to see a young nigga on top that came from nothing
They gone hate to feel this big ass 40 Glock up on they nugget
If you feeling froggy, jump or just sip the tea just like a muppet
Pop a flat I'm up no I can't catch no Z's not for nothing
You a rapper, when we catch you make you bleed before you mumble
And I don't ask for much yah I might be conceited but I'm humble

[Hook: Cago Leek]
I remember I was trapping hard for the money
I remember all them gun wars in the summer
I remember all them young hoes that was bussing
I remember I ain't have a slug now I'm stunting

I remember I was trapping hard for the money
I remember all them gun wars in the summer
I remember all them young hoes that was bussing
I remember I ain't have a slug now I'm stunting

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Big G Herbo I love going hard I be stunting
No shirt with my J on, balmain jeans full of hundreds
Member I ain't have nothing, now I keep the hoes fucking
No Limit know how we coming, play with us and we bussing
In the field no ducking
Want war let us know something we gone get to it no discussion, big guns like the Russians
If you over east and you know me then you know I get money
This sky daughter cost 40k straight plain jane no nothing
Got a 30k just to flood it, all the bad bitches love it

Tinted up thats a eye roll, 40 hollows in the tahoe
No Limit gang thats ano this Chicago, shoutout Cago
