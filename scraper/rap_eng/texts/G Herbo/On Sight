[Lil Herb]
Riding over east smoking dope, flipping blocks, me and [?]
If we see the ops we gone let them glizzies pop, now he in a box
Get off drank and do his a lot
Getting top, I be getting guap
Been through shit, I don't feel a lot
If you in the streets, better grip a Glock
Nigga you ain't never flipped a block
Nigga you ain't never killed a op
No you are not what you rap about
You single shooting but your killas not
Herbo you can catch me in the streets
Ask me will I take your picture, maybe
Only 18 Im a 90's baby
2010 I used to tote .380s
Now we tote them .40s and them .50s
.30s beams hanging of them glizzies
Pull up on you, don't be looking crazy
Drop a nigga then we off the lazy
Now them shorties posted on the eight block
Ballin like Im Kobe till the tape drop
When Im trigger squeezing bitch you can't stop
Run up on a nigga make his face drop
