[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with them goons cause the goons gone shoot
Think White Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clapping, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, from fucking with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it's still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up
(Bibby what's up bro?)
Niggas round here talk crazy bout what they'll do to a motherfucker
(Like what?)
You think I'm worried about a nigga man?
We got more choppers (check), more lawyers (yup), and I'll die bout my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
Eating meals with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
Still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop em once you startup my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' starts with my niggas
They ain't tryna play the part of my niggas
Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + Lil Herb]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, Bibby tryna run a check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Use your head 'fore I leave it on the curb
This real talk, this is not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
Had to call to the city, check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? I'm ridin' over east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but I feel like a grown-up
Aye Lil Bibby look at the mess that we madeAll these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
In my face, on my dick
Big face on my wrist shit be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was bout to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hit my nigga TIP like
