[Intro]
You know man I learned something
That life is life regardless
You only get one good or bad
You just gotta make the best of it look
Look

[Verse]
I used to couldn't stand the rain
Now the stormin' keep me sane like I'm immune to pain
I know shit never stays the same, it's always bound to change
I came from Essex, hunnid deep, to barely round the game
I'm still the same No Limit nigga, I just found a lane
Now I'm the first born that's some' my momma proud to say
And now she all smiles, I had to take the frown away
Used to be a wild child, I had to calm down
My grandma used to worry, pray for me, I'm grown now
Success, Leadership, I gained that on my own while
And now my grandma gone, they want me to be strong
(How?)
I might just lose it all you say some' to me wrong
*BOW*
Don't stare at me too long
Don't come to me on my phone foul
I fuck around, curse out the courtroom on my own trial
Like fuck the judge, you never wanted to give me a chance
Don't wanna see me greet the people, see me shakin' hands
Don't want yo kids watchin' my shit on MTV Jams
So if I honor any honor nigga I'd be damned
I'm fighting cases now, the judge want me to go to school
I graduated from the streets, what I'm supposed to do
You'n understand my lifestyle, what I'm going through
Just think about if you was me and what if I was you
A nigga tryin' to take my life ain't I supposed to shoot
If I stay in the hood will I grow up as old as you
Where niggas raise they own sister, gotta mold the two
Your mother had a nose to smell, theirs had a nose to toot
You feel me
I spit the truth I know that shit just make you wanna kill me
But nigga this the real me
While labels wanna deal me, but fuck that shit
I'll hold off and make them labels feel me
See my vision, I'm the business nigga couple mill me
Once I run up a milli, oh thank you lord I'm in my bag
Run up another milli , oh thank you lord I'm in my bag
Alone one in school, it was cold outside
Me and lil sis ain't have no cash
Couldn't take a bus we ain't have no pass
Mom at work we ain't have no ride
Now I might be in Bermuda
On the beach house ridin' scooters
I just might jump in the Bentley
I spent twenty thou' with uber
Niggas know I still be with them shooters
On the road yeah I keep them on standby
Real street nigga ain't never gone fold
Follow that code the only thing I stand by
And I been in the road like err' night
Doin' shows like err' night
Feel like a vampire, missin' flights
Gotta nigga on standby
Born at midnight, that's a red eye
Say I ain't been on the grind, you a damn liar
Remember 2012, I was in a van high, ridin' round with my guys Couple of my niggas dead now
Seen a lot of my niggas disappear before my eyes
Couple of them in the feds now
If I kill a nigga dead will It make me the bad guy
Because they startin' to think I'm scared now
Don't think that you won't end up on a redeye
I'm still one of them hitters now
I don't wanna relax
I don't wanna close my eyes, last great granny said "Why?"
Start thinkin' to myself as the tears cover my eyes
"Granny please would you stay alive?"
Start praying to the gods tears runnin' down my eyes
"Would you please help her stay alive?"
Right side of her body still paralyzed
Now I really wanna scream, wanna yell now
You ain't gotta keep fighting I can't be selfish
Go be with Mary we buried now
I can still hear voices of you all In my chest
I can see the spirit all in the air now
Used to be a lil part still left in my heart
And since you left I don't really care now
