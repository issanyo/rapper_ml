[Intro]
I'm just trying to be great
Look

[Verse 1 - G Herbo]
1995, Fall night, October 8th
Most people would say a star was born but nah, that's when I was born
And I wasn't born a star, nigga I wasn't born on top
I remember walking cold from school when mom's ain't had no car
Me my cousins 6 deep, walkin back to grannies spot
School in another district so that's like 11 blocks
And on that walk is shooters, niggas sellin rocks and hella cops
Fast forward 10 years later and that shit ain't never stopped
I became a product, all my niggas sellin' products
Growin up they want them dolla's
Birthdays without no fathers
And i had my dad so i couldn't really understand they pain
You don't even see his face but you got that nigga name
And my problem with my pops is we don't communicate
I see his face all the time but its just hi and bye
He know I love him, thats my nigga, I ain't gotta lie
But you can't give a bird his wings and teach him how to fly
I'm hard body, heavy thinker, Imma handle mine
He taught me that, I'll give him that, yeah Imma handle mine
And nigga I was 16, livin like a grown man
Never needed nobody, nigga I'm my own man
And my momma loved me for it, she would tell me she proud of me
I always had it in me, she like how I brought it out of me
She stay right by my side, back when everybody doubted me
And thought i would end up in the pen or the county see
But now I'm in a penthouse suite on the balcony
I used to think a million was for everybody, you gonna grow up and have a house, that life for everybody
But wait 1 rich person can't take care of everybody (What?)

[Hook - Sonta]
The world is filled with pain (yeahhh)
The world is filled with pain (oooh)
The world is filled with pain (Is filled with pain pain pain painnnn)
The world is filled with pain (With pain, yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2 - G Herbo]
Man i used to post up, early morning, soon as i woke up
Went to sleep at 4 something, used to skip breakfast, swishers and doughnuts
With the same niggas, everyday the same shit (Everyday the same shit)
War with the same suckers
Fuckin on the same bitches
Then a thought came to my head sayin you gotta expand
You passed the ball enough, its time to keep the rock in your hand
I know all the pressure like you got the block in your hands
Can't forget about them, yeah i know Rock was your mans
But can't forget your sister, mother, brother, pops and your grans
Don't owe nobody shit the lifestyle come after the fam
And Never Leave My Brothers thats for life, the block is my fam, damn
Who i sacrificing for? The block of my fam?
But anyways i miss my niggas
So thats why I'm getting twisted, I don't sip the liquor
I'm just high pouring sixes and I'm ridin with my 45
Cuze I ain't trying to end up victim of a homicide
Not my momma crying

[Hook - Sonta]
The world is filled with pain (yeahhh)
The world is filled with pain (oooh)
The world is filled with pain (Is filled with pain pain pain painnnn)
The world is filled with pain (With pain, yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 3 - J. Tsunami]
Understand that I can relate to everything that you sayin, because i grew up just like you
It was me and my lil brother, pops, OG, and momas too
My grandfather, one auntie, two uncles and their childrens too
All them people under one roof, but we took that and we made do
Back in the day my folks had cake so people thought that we was on
But truth be told shit more than half of that was gone before i was born
Three years old thats when moms and pops relationship was torn
Them not fuckin' with each other made me father my lil brothers
From the city to the burbs we was goin back and forth
So I was in and out of schools, lived everywhere but West and North
Eating pork and beans and noodles not by choice but more so force
Til one day i told myself i can't continue on the course
Now lets speed it up, 2005 I came back to the hood
Started hustlin lil packs and everything was going good
Plus i had my own gun so i wished a nigga would
Try to take anything from me, I'd have left him where he stood
I grew out that state of mind, the games I was playing was kiddy
Yeah here comes 2009 all i hear is you and Bibby
I had faith in y'all but who'd have thought you'd take over the city
Used to think y'all forgot about or just wasn't fuckin with me
I was rappin at the time, but y'all was puttin in that work
And shit I ain't even gonna lie, when you took off shit I was hurt
Cuze I expected a handout, that's where I fucked up first
But I thank y'all cuze y'all the reason i go cray on every verse
(The world is filled with pain)

[Hook - Sonta]
The world is filled with pain (yeahhh)
The world is filled with pain (oooh)
The world is filled with pain (Is filled with pain pain pain painnnn)
The world is filled with pain (With pain)

[Bridge - Sonta]
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave (I wanna leave)
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave (I'm still better than me)
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave (I wanna ball)
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave (So much pain, So much pain)

[Hook - Sonta]
The world is filled with pain
The world is filled with pain
I know you fell me, you got to feel me, please feel me
The world is filled with pain (Is filled with pain pain pain painnnn)
The world is filled with pain (With pain, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
