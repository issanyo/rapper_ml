Ay Swervo

[Verse 1]
Heard its cold in the Raq right now i'm riding down Rodeo
Been got introduced to snow i used to play wit yayo
Diss the gang and don't get dealt wit that boy got a halo
Let off 50 shots then skeet off that clip that boy got a Draco
Loyal nigga got some knowledge put him on a pay roll
Walk around with couple thousands thats my everyday roll
Used to live in public housing no heat, roaches, mouses now i ride most Italian and it got the lowest mileage
Member we was rollin wildin damn Doowop you member we was rollin round with
9's Two Glocks sipping lean buying 2 pops and we had often shootouts i remember we was boxed in they let off everything then you pop
I remember we in traffic its late night just me and you Cap
Fucking on the same hoes we just tryna find some new bops
City smoke wit clear blue sky unless we had some new opps
Don't go right next to this car unless you high yeah i think they knew not
Don't go right next to this car unless you high hop out and you die
Ever since that happen i been Cappin you don't Cap then you die
Yall know how we bleed Kobe Cappin sipping lean over lapsing
AMG know i got a need for speed Mazzis Astons
Through the hills all in the grove, downtown Calabasas
Driving fast talking to hoes rolling gas dropping ashes
Who would of thought i was junior still in high school failing all my classes
Then i went to school of Hard Knocks flying colours all those passes
Taught me how to make a knot taught me got to keep a pistol
Taught me never talk to cops told me that is not official
But i learnt that from observation weren't no questions I was asking
Bitches told me i was ashy, i been in my pockets actually
I'm just on top of this hip hop folk nem selling pounds of zip Locks we just rotate whips to condos everything 50 thousand wrist watch
Fazoland lil nigga rip roc don't have beef wit lil box red beam on the 30 Glock
Match my Gucci flip flops
As soon as i start letting off that stick i don't care who get hurt
I do what i wanna bitch like lil Lil Uzi Vert
When i learn how to drive the stick i might do the vert
Go get on that corner and i put you that work
Im no organ donor so i might do the perk
2 grams 7 pointers of majuirana
Member buying 20 ounces to pour a 4 in there
Still wake up every morning like Tom Joyner
Got a trap with ps, keys, cash, AKs and some more in there
But you can't hang if you ain't gang that mean you can't go in there
Going hard even if its wholesale gotta go in there but right now i'm just on tour just ring the bell i think lil bro in there

Yall know how we bleed, Pour a 4 in there
Yall know how we bleed
Yall know how we bleed, Pour a 4 in there
Yall know how we bleed
