Just a nigga off the block tryna chase them dollaz
You boys broke, I thank the lord I dont face them problems
Im at the table, full plate eating steak wit goblins
Walk in the shop counting them knots
Like "I'll take the Robins"
Herbo just a young nigga
Love 2 Stunt nigga
I just wanna become rich
I hope it come quicker
And they hate that im up nigga
I ain't dumb nigga
Thats why all of my young niggas got they guns wit em
Herbo just a young nigga
Love 2 Stunt nigga
I just wanna become rich
I hope it come quicker
And they hate that im up nigga
I ain't dumb nigga
Thats why all of my young niggas got they guns wit em

[Verse 1]
Walk up in the shop on Stony, ill take the Robins
And I pray for any nigga that can't wait to rob me
Cuz I got that 30 on me, I can't wait to pop it
Fuck the Jakes, my money straight
Build a case and drop it
Lately I heard alotta niggas hate me, stop it
And lately niggas say they gonna erase me, stop it
And maybe im losing focus and my patience droppin
Or I just might not be on point, but I be taeski watchin
You can catch me in the field
Everyday we clockin
Money always to the right
Thats the .380 pocket
Run up, watch me blast off
Thats the .380 rocket
You've been welcomed to Chiraq
Even the baby sparkin
And its killed or be killed here
Even the babies heartless
When shit get real my niggas drill
Everyday we marchin
Everyday them hammers cock
Everyday they droppin
And niggas dead my broski Roc
So ain't no way we stoppin
Its Rocblock til the deathbed
Saw a opp, let that Glock rock til his chest bled
You dont wanna catch a topshot unless you vesthead
Yea and I dont talk, ya mans only heard what the tech said
And his ass dead
Ridin thru the opps block
We just lookin for dreads
Wit them books in the chopshop
We just lookin for feds
We ain't worryin bout no niggas
We cookin his head
.223's burn his ass
We cook him with lead
Left the snakes in the grass
Took my niggas instead
Still Free to G. Gill while he up in the feds
T-Slim on his way, been upstate for them years
Real niggas from the go, man just hold up ya head
And Joc did a long time for the wrong crime
So broski this summer for you and its all mine
And broski we coming for you when its yo time
Just know I got something for you I need more time
Im on the grind like a heavyweight
They say if you dont grind, you dont shine
So I went to cop this bezel face
Reach for my bezel face, dont hesitate
I blow this metal 8, you levitate
Like you featherweight, im in a race

[Verse 2]
Herb straight from the slums where the gangstas at
Killas, robbas, junkies, and rapists at
Over East where some niggas never make it at
In the streets, fake niggas can't relate to that
Essex block, murder scene nigga
Where it's all about the green
You a trapper or a feen nigga
You can catch me with my team nigga
No Limit MB, smokin loud drinkin lean nigga
We take offense over here nigga
Either worry about ya mouth or better say what you mean nigga
30 in a ning-ding
Make a real scary scene, hollow tips, red beam nigga
Cash rule everything nigga
So I got choppers for the team
And the drama that it bring wit it
Yeah I pop alotta beans nigga
I dont ever wanna sleep cuz im up chasin dreams nigga
Gotta get this money, and these lil niggas funny
Cuz im always outside, how they "lookin" for me?
You can slide thru, tryna ride thru
We advise you, shells fly comin right behind you
We gon ride too
You can hide too
We gon find you
Homicide say I ain't remind you
But we ain't talkin to the jakes over here
If they grab you better not answer
What they asky you
Know that snitches get
These 40's out the 50 clip
Flame up if you get the shit
Niggas gettin caught wit bricks nd shit
Sayin the jury dismissed the shit
Nah, you ain't with the shit
Hand down to the snitchin shit
Ill never say a word
I ain't good at makin sentences
While im tryna get rich and shit
Hallways full of piss
Where im from, come picture this
