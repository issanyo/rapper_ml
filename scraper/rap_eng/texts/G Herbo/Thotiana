[Verse 1: 2kDrae]
See, I don't wife 'em, I one night 'em
For the dick, yeah, these thots be fighting, ah, one more time
Said, I don't wife 'em, I one night 'em
For the dick, yeah, these thots be fighting
Good girl with you, but with me, she dyking
Pass to your bitch, that's your bitch ass wifey
I don't fuck with these thots, said I don't love these hoes
Said I smash these bitches, then I tell 'em "Adios"
Said these chicks doing the most
Bitch live life like we out of these shows
And my pockets fat, so that bitch just shows
And she ain't getting shit, that's what she don't know
Said her mouth dirtier than a landfill
Suck a dick and she go and kiss her man still
You don't think she going, but I bet she will
Couple stacks and she acting like that's a mill
She'll blow me while I'm blowing Q
And she love the kid cause I'mma keep it real
She wanna be with me but she know how I feel
When I hopped in the ride, already know the deal
And I fucked her once of a couple pills
Made her toes curl, down to her heels
Bang her head board like my name O'Neal
But I swear that I'll never wife a thot still, like

[Hook]
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no, no
Don't wife that thotiana, thotiana, thotiana

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Smoking dutches on my dead ops, pasto got my head gone
Thot bitches on my dick, wanna fuck a nigga cause my bread long
I be high off the drink, fuck a few minutes then I send her ass home
And I be riding, smoking stank with my niggas, .30 clips hanging out the chrome
I get super high when I'm alone, I got big choppers at my home
I'm from 79, we got .7s, .9s, Glizzys, .40s that'll get him gone
And these thotianas always rushing me
I know they wanna fuck a nigga
But these thotianas they gon' bust for me
They gotta fuck my other niggas
Fuck my other brothers then go fuck your niggas
I love puffing Swishers, I ain't cuffing bitches
When you in my home, I'm just tryna bone
We ain't taking pictures, don't take nothing with ya', lil bitch
And listen here, remember we ain't catching feelings, lil bitch
Knock me down while I'm driving, I swear I can't even pay attention

[Hook]
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, that thotiana
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no
Don't wife that thotiana, no, no
Don't wife that thotiana, thotiana, thotiana
