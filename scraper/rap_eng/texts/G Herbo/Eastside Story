[Intro]
Ay, G Herbo, this a real Eastside story right here man
RIP them niggas, hah

[Verse]
Used to ride the front of the bus now I'm in the back of the Bach
Nigga this that Maybach, remember way back, I was trapping and strapped
This was back when Lil Roc stay with Titi an I start fucking with Cap
G-Mo was in the trap, used to give me dap, before I was fucking with rap
I met Kobe on the five, we was Mike'd down in '05
Girbauds and spray painted shirts
Now big bro own one of mine
Wake up, money on my mind
Think bout fonem all the time
Back when Grams lived on the four
First floor, 7405
Vito stayed on the other side
Him and Hill real running wild
WIth Chico and probably smoking dro
8 bucks for a pound of loud
Used to leave for school, lil blac on chico nem porch all the time
Fuck with OGs off the five
Shorties and shit just wasnâ€™t my crowd
Foe nem fucking up the wheel
I ran bouchet, ain't fuck with powell
That was grade school by the way, we been them niggas all this time
Acting East headed for the rap, damn near still know all the rhymes
Five to nine, yates back to colfax terrortown was on the map
Niggas know there ain't a bitch we ain't fucked, taking hoes back
Used to do pelly coats with the screw back
Chrome buck 50, matched the new gat
Leather (?) with the wheat timbs
Fazo had one that was blue black
G Fazo, no need to say more
Punch so hard, make you wanna shoot back
Shawty off MB don't do that
Fuck that, I ain't even wanna talk about it
Miss all my niggas, white chalk about 'em
Naw they ain't like us, niggas bitch made
Lil nigga, big gun, that was Lil Gage
Fucked up, lil bro was lil sis age
Made 1800 on a good day
"You gon end up dead or broke
Or in jail like your dad and uncle," shit, that's what the hood say
Might as well sell dope, rob, steal anything tryna stay afloat
I'm on point like an arrow
Aim the Glock like PeeWee, tell the opp, "hello"
Got smoke like Dero, remember walking down Marquette, me and G Ferro
Hoodied up if we got to blow
Still fuck the opps crazy, RIP Alamo
79th Street raised me, some of my niggas since babies
No Limit crazy
Remember nights off the lazy
Mom's telling me to slow down, steady tryna persuade me
I was deep in the streets, she calling and getting no sleep
Scared for her baby
I was running the east
Turning into Herbo G
The big humble beast, ay
