[Intro: Both]
Gang! You already know what the fuck it is man, NLMB
150 Roc Block shit man
You know no niggas fucking with us man
I tried to tell niggas man, it's over
Game over shit

[Verse 1: Herb]
All I know, get money fuck bitches and
Keep it a 100 plus 50 with my niggas man
No Limit, 150, we them niggas, man
Herbo, Lil Bibby, we at it again

[Verse 2: Bibby]
All I know is get money and stack it
In the trap Lil Bibby make the pack flip
Chopper hit 'em, make a nigga do a back flip
These niggas, they bitches, they actors

[Verse 3: Herb]
But they do it good, they can probably get a Grammy
Like Fredo, niggas bitches, what you need, panties?
Dirty Crush, Pacquiao knock me out, Manny
Bad bitch, 5'5, light brown candy

[Verse 4: Bibby]
All my young niggas hitta's, I ain't talking Sammy
Baby .9 in the booth, yeah it come in handy
Love red bones but Iâ€™ll fuck Brandy
Tryna' creep on this niggas but I had a crammy

[Verse 5: Bibby]
Got a .4-5, two Glock nines
Tryna' argue? I ain't got time
Pull up on a nigga by the stop sign
Slide the doors back then it's shots fired
It's Chiraq, this shit serious
Just bought a thirty clip for the SIG
I'll kill bitch and I'll kill her kids
It all depends what her nigga did

[Verse 6: Herb]
We're killa's, we don't show no sympathy
Murder one or all my enemies
I lost my niggas, I can't feel a thing
Aw, they deep? Lil' bro go clear the scene
He saw the shots but ain't hear the beam
He saw the shots but ain't hear the beam
Beg my pardon, I been sipping lean
Red or purple, I don't sip the green

[Verse 7: Bibby]
Hold up, turn the beat off
Lil' bro do a hit then skeet off
These niggas keep hating, I just feed off it
Fo' fo' bulldog, tear the meat off

[Verse 8: Herb]
AR 15, tear his head off it
Your money short, come with it, I'mma wear it off
And every time I see the cops I'mma play it off
I don't pay no damn note, bitch I pay it off

[Verse 9: Bibby]
Real black tints, I just hide in the whip
New M6, no miles on my shit
Can't waste no time with a bitch
Money coming, I'm just piling the shit

[Verse 10: Herb]
It keep coming now I can't get enough
Bitch suck me to death, now I can't get it up
My shooters on the line like Ginobli and stuff
Two fours in my pop, off the Kobe I'm stuck

[Interlude: Both]
These niggas so funny man
Nigga wanna talk man then a nigga get dropped down one
Say what you got to say, what they gon' say?
Niggas already know what it is man
We been doing this shit man
Niggas know we been the hottest, we been getting money
We been pulling up on whatever blocks, wetting shit, gang!
I'm going back in, Free Crack 2, the mixtape

[Verse 11: Herb]
Before this rapping we was playing with poles
Chasing back and we gon' take a soul
Keep up with us cause niggas can't no more
They like: "This another Play They Role!"

[Verse 12: Bibby]
I'm getting money, all my cases old
A nigga can't never say he told
Used to weigh the grams, now they weigh the gold
Rob who, fill his face with holes
