Verse 1 (Zeekio)

Zeekio I'm bout a bag on them broke days I reminisce
Bronem was bussin' fits I had to get on my juggin shit
Like a Jesse White Tumble Team I was tryin' to make that money flip
Hundred bands and hundred clips just understand Im getting it
Posted up in the same trap in the gangway where we hang at
Put the 45 to the boy shirt like MJ when he came back
Damn thats a murder scene for yo man
All you heard was click clack blam
I ain't tweaking off no xan
Bitch Im focused on my money til my whole squad see bands
And I owe god my life cuz he got me out that jam l
Young hot head talk beef let it blow
But I had to learn that you reap what you soe
So police on patrol and the D's and my door
Hideout in the trap with the fiends on the floor
My route to the stacks anything for the dough
Im out with the gat in the heat in the cold
Gotta get the money anything for some mo'
Me and Lil Herb pop so flee to ya hoe
That bitch on me like keys in a door
Get money 4 ways that seasonal flow
I beez in the trap Kush B's what I smoke
And bitches know me I'm Ze to the Ko

Verse 2 (G Herbo)

Lil Herb just a young nigga
Gotta get money used to gang bang
I got everybody on the same thing
Ever since they saw me in the gangway
But im the sameway smokin' swishers
And I'm smokin' bitches on the 8 block
Servin fiends til my tape drop
Ride thru' and catch a face shot
Let the K pop
Everwhere we go them K's pop
We some young boys
Better run boy see this gun boy
Yeah we let them bitches low for fun boy
You ain't from here then dont come boy
Or you dumb boy Im tryin' to tell you
Shorties blowing and they voluntary
Man this real life I ain't't tryin' to scare you
Live a real life
You know you beef with us in real life you get killed right?
I be cashing out fucking freaky hoes
Spazzing out me and Zeekio
Later on catch me posted
Run up on me you get toasted
Getting to the money focused
Seven-hundred($700) Louie Loafers
And I still came from the bottom of the line
Hated being broke so I got up on the grind
Didn't think about school too much money on my mind
And fuck a bitch I got money on the line
When I get rich I'm throwing hundreds on the nine
Yeah Im throwing hundreds on the nine
Ima make it rain when it's sunny on the nine
Ran up on Herb put some in his spine
