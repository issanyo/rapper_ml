[Verse 1: G Count]
Any nigga that try me, hit 'em with a Mac 90
Show up blowin' at your funeral, yeah my niggas that grimey
Straight up knew I was a rida'
All I need is a shoota' and a driver
It don't matter if you riding passenger
We just start shooting that side up
My lil' niggas, yeah here they come
They off the shits and they carry guns
They say it's fun, they don't give a fuck
They stick you up no matter where you from, my niggas dogs
They nailing motherfuckers to the cross and they young
They done lost count how many bodies they done caught
Last year was so many of em
Many of 'em got hundred round drums, fuck them little 30 shot clips
I ain't playin nigga, all I'm sayin'
If you shoot at me you better not miss
Yeah the New Regime, we straight savage

Killer season
We the reason that they had to go and make a safe passage

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I got money, guns, goons, bitches, respect, nigga
For this rap beef I have my shooters get at niggas
Killers walk upon you like a bitch in a dress, nigga
Shorties ditching school, they just itchin' to stretch niggas
Ride through trippin' better know where you at, nigga
Or be the next nigga gettin' done like the last nigga
Hand guns on us but the Mac's in the stash, nigga
Catch you out in traffic and you know that's you ass, nigga
And I don't really give a fuck about the city
But there ain't a thing that I wouldn't do for my block
When the people come niggas start switchin' up quick
If they snatch me I don't know who done got shot
Don't hit me with a at nigga tell me where you at
I'm in the streets, nigga I ain't with the internet war
Ain't a nigga lookin' for me cause they know where I'm at
Off a flat, run up on me that's a suicide boy
All these niggas snaking don't know who they ride for
Niggas bitches, he a witness, hollows in his fitted
It was 3 killers, 2 snitchin and 1 gon' do the sentence
Smokin on Swishers fuck bitches, still gon' do the dishes
No twitter ho, nigga, you gon' do the mentions
Catch me 4 nickel, Rugers with extensions
Pull up smoke niggas, we don't do pretendin'
Now he just a picture swimmin' with the fishes
