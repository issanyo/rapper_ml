[Verse 1]
Look, yeah the life I choose yeah its ignant
Started off with playing sports, and got adapted into tha killin
Too easy to get lost into the system, when you in it
I get a city game, just going listen to amendment, they had to feel it
I lost my round and went stupid look lucky, they had to feel it
I popped enough, yeah I went passed my limits
I failed enough, so fuck it I had to listen
I'm fighting charges because of bad decisions
I met a plug and got some badder bitches
If prince was here, yea I'll be laughing with him
I miss my dog, wish I could share it with him
I got a bullet for you right nigga
Straight up
Bitch don't tell me how you fell, because I fell like fucking
I'm geeking hard, they standing still, but yet I'm still getting bluntin
I told my story on this music, I ain't lying bout nothing
This that Tre, we say "ON Tee"[?]
Then 'em bitches start coming
When you flying getting money, all 'em bitches be coming
And when I fuck 'em like I love 'em, so they stuck with a youngin
Smokin jewels, and pouring fools, when I be thuggin with youngin's
Know that


[G Herbo]
Look, I been trippin
I ain't listen
In a minute
Except for my intuition
Or I'll push the start ignition
Member I was starving, [?]
In apartments roaches wandering
Now I get booked
That's ticket deposit
But, I just took like 15 from a college
And my og living marvelous
Everything marble
Feel like 3 whips in garages
And my little nigga still heartless
All I do call 'em
They slide on you with the carbon
But, I just went through got through with tha darkness
I'm trying to show 'em, no life we not promised
Put in tha the work, then we fuck up tha commas
Leave all that other little petty shit yonder
But you we still got ride wit 'em Llamas
You know I got, stay low like Obama
I get so sick of the state
I'm trynna go fuck up tha Bahamas
I'm trynna drop my first album
Remember when I made my first album
Being broke I couldn't allow it
Give my momma my whole house allowance
My rollie under tha shower
I smoke a whole ounce a hour
I used to sleep in the trap house, now I wake up in the towers
Pull up make niggas sour
But, I put that work in for hours
Yea I wake up in tha towers
And that gift my OG a hour [?]
