When I wanna smoke dope, I just say let's get it
When I wanna bad bitch, I just say let's get it
When I'm 'bout to cash out, I just say let's get it
Let's get it, get it
Let's get it, get it
When I wanna smoke dope, I just say let's get it
When I wanna bad bitch, I just say let's get it
When I'm 'bout to cash out, I just say let's get it
Let's get it, get it
Let's get it, get it

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
I'm 'bout to cash out, let's get it
I brought them racks out, let's get it
Lil bro got MACs out, let's get it
Whack him if he act out
White god gon' spazz out
We poppin' pills, let's roll up
In the kitchen whippin' coke up
Then I mix it with the soda
Bitches love me 'cause I go nuts
Suckin' dick but I don't know her
And I don't wanna get to know her
She just sucks and licks and gives me close ups
I'm Raf Simons so I go nuts
But only back shots, I don't waste time
Her pussy fat and her pussy wet
I may bust in that, but it ain't matter
Real talk bitch, Lil Herb I'ma boss bitch
And I'm getting money so I talk shit
I be spending money like I lost it
Blew 12 hundred on Lacoste
I got bail money, I'm off shit, my niggas for it
My boy Boots in the strip club
Countin' all hundreds and he's finna throw it
We splurgin;, we be gettin' money 'cause we splurgin'
And all my haters them my motivators
Bitch I'm spendin' money on purpose

[Verse 2: Kush Papi]
Tell me one lane you can exit
I'm gettin' this money don't sweat it
These bitches be ratchets they get it
Pull up fuck it let's get it
Smokin' that dope man let's get it
Pour up a drank man let's get it
Pop a pill now I'm up in it
I'm so fucked up now so let's get it
Boy you don't know me
Catch up from my team
But I crew some jeans
Or maybe retro 13s
Then earn it back from the fiends
Serve 'em white or some green
If you're stalkin' me on Twitter
I block a bitch like sunscreen
Hop on your track for free? That's whack
For that goofy shit you deserve a smack
Italian mob shit, I'm about that
If you doubt me man go ahead
I'll have my hittas come through
Have your body fall like beef stew
Back to the crib I pop a corkscrew
Watch your pussy ass on the news
And I ain't got no worries 'cause the mob ain't leave no clues
I just called up broski saying let's get it, hit up the crew
And I ain't got no worries 'cause the mob ain't leave no clues
I just called up broski saying let's get it, hit up the crew
