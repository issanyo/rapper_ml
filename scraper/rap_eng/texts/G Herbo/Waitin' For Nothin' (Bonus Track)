[Intro]
I'm just livin' man
Blowing smoke , stress easy
Just trying to get to the main goal, look

[Hook]
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am I stuntin'
Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'

[Verse 1]
Big G Herbo been signed but never had me a big deal
Grew up with both parents, never had me a big wheel
Instead I had my momma, that's what keep me sane
And can't forget about my poppa, he taught me the game
Always told me to stay focused and make me a lane
Be a leader, don't you worry about being lame
You know niggas only worried bout making names
Chasing after bitches, don't want money, they just chasing fame But I'm a kid, who the fuck wanna be a lame, pops
I'm just tryna play ball, I ain't in a gang pops
It ain't my fault that everybody round me know my name pops
And I seen a lot of shit so I don't act my age pops
I'm getting older, I'm just graduating eighth grade pops
Soon as I turned 13, trouble with the cops
Soon as I turned 14, started seeing Glocks
Fazo toting 30 shots in the middle of the block

[Hook]
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am
I stuntin' Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'

[Verse 2]
We used to post up by the light pole waiting for the opps to flip
Lil bro got that banger on him, run up and start flamin' on 'em
On the 8th we 100 deep , neighbors down the street keep complaining on us
We ain't going nowhere, we in this shit til it start raining on us When it rain, put a hoodie on, now we slidin'
Catch him while he blindin', blaah, perfect timing
I left that life behind me but best believe that I'm still grimy
East side of Chicago where you found me
And them other niggas wanna blam me but they don't really understand me
I'ma shoot it out like Kyrie, gotta make it back to my family
Told Cap when my tape drop, watch everybody try to sign me
Cap said " Nigga fuck labels we young niggas we grinding "
I know you see your boy shining, rollie face full of diamonds
Holy water dip charm piece block everything tryna harm me Cuban link and a kilo but that bitch still like a dime tho
And I don't know when my time close so I gotta stick to the iron tho

[Hook]
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am I stuntin'
Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'
