[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Ratchet shit shawty and em popping out the cut, fappin shit
Shawty know I'm tryna brack it, her butt fat as shit
Got a automatic under my jacket and I'm with it was happenin
I just popped a lil half a yerk so I'm feeling fantastic
I'm like fuck it I'ma just go to work cause I been in the bank like Ashton
I'll buy a lil bitch a Jaguar, I want me an Aston
Hood bitch with me like a NASCAR driver she ain't been in no fast one
And I'm smoking a v live she giving head while I'm drivin, I'ma fuck around crash it
I'm like fuck it I wanna smash right now, I'ma take her to the mansion
I told her I still wanna suck on her titties though even though they plastic
In that new shit I can self park the whip, I'm feeling Jurassic
And you know I pop out with a whip on my wrist huh, look at the dash
Got a bank account nobody know about, yeah I just fill it with cash
Everybody wanna fuck your sister, Stacey Dash
But it ain't really cause I'm faced with her lil basic ass

[Chorus]
Up it, up it, (ah) up it, nigga up it
(uh) Nigga fuck it
I'ma count this bitch and up it
(uh) She gon' up it
Bitch up it
Quick get to ducking
Fuck it, bitch up it

[Verse 2]
You ain't like yo neighbors, they lil racist ass
You used to be a fuck nigga so you tryna erase the past
You hating on me cause I'm a young nigga and I chase the bag
We ain't smoking but on nothing but exotic, you'll think we laced the bag
I got my bitch a Chanel bag (uh), cost like twelve stacks
Running track hoe (huh), fuck your hellcat
And I'm a bad boy, I'm a bad influence
Tell a nigga what he gon' do, make him fast forward
And don't let no nigga hold you, keep that mag no Pro Tools
Keep that bag
Overheat that Mac
And I'm a star, check my vv's
You can't see these hoes from afar
I mean you can [?]
Don't care if you BD or if you GD
We on that car
Word to my ma, word to y'all
Word to Allah, whoever your god
[?]

[Chorus]
Up it, up it, up it, nigga up it
Nigga fuck it
I'ma count this bitch and up it
She gon' up it
Bitch up it
Quick get to duckin
Fuck it, bitch up it (up it)
