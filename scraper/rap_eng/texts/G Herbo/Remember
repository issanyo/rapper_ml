[Intro]
Look man, I'll spit that soulful shit man
All that real shit from the heart for all my niggas that's dead
All my niggas incarcerated, my family
Everybody that been through something man, cause I'm from the struggle so that's who I do it for
And all my fans, look

[Verse 1]
Remember me? Yeah I came from nothing
Stayed humble on my grind, stuck to it, now I wake up stunting
But I had to humble down on my own
Fuck niggas I'ma die on my own
So thats why I'm alone
Remember Me, Fazo, and Manski used to hoop at the center
Now big homie gone and broski eating tuna for dinner
Then they really ask me why I'm a sinner
Cause I'ma already gonna die by the system, So why abide by the system
Ain't nobody did shit for Herbo
So ain't nobody getting shit from Herbo, But a clip from Herbo
I'm just tryin to live good man and take care of my family
Never hated I just waited shouldn't be no nigga mad at me
And I gotta stay strapped cause I know niggas after me
I prefer a 1-4 over the county morgue
Bail money I won't even see the county doors
I went from Pissy hallways to them marble floors

[Interlude]
(A collect call from...(?))
Look man I just told y'all this the type of shit I do it for man
All my niggas incarcerated
All my dead niggas man
I promise to die wasn't none of this shit playing I could drop down and die right now man
I'm answering these county calls everyday man
Putting money on all my niggas Books making sure they good man that's the type of shit I get into man

[Hook - The Mind]
Cause am I worthy
I stayed up late and when day
Came woke up early
Early x2
I'm starting to feel boxed in
Losing my conscious
What if I'm trapped in?
What if I'm locked in?
These bars can't hold me
The lord consoles me
Tryin to make it right but wrong is all around
And I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down

[Verse 2]
I'm 19 years going on 39
I done seen murders, rapes, mommas crying right on that fucking 9
Then where we at, back on that fucking 9
Fiends and detectives trying to see who got that pack jumping on the 9
Momma told me stay away
My Grandma told me stay away
But right back out there everyday like that crack on that fucking 9
Young niggas donâ€™t listen just load up they pistols and stunt for them bitches and front how they living indictments on pictures
Nah I ain't fucking with them insta-feds
Unless they lock me up for sipping lean, fuck around and get the chair
Cause I be pouring this shit everywhere
Like Wayne said so I don't feel it when it hit but I ain't never scared
Cause when its time to go its time to go
That's why I'm going hard now to leave my granny and my mom some dough
Pay to get my sister through school
You know some shit like that
Not the cars, clothes shit you lose and get right back (nigga)

[Outro]
That's just the way it is man
I don't want to do anymore talking man
Ballin like I'm Kobe the mixtape
150 dream team man
Free all my niggas man, RIP my niggas man
I'm just going to let the beat lead me out man, that's all I got

[Hook - The Mind]
Cause am I worth it
I stayed up late and when day
Came woke up early
Early
I'm starting to feel boxed in
Losing my conscious
What if I'm trapped in?
What if I'm locked in?
These bars can't hold me
The lord consoles me
Trying to make it right but wrong is all around
And I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
