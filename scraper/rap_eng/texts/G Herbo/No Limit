One of them that's me and that's till the death of me
Fazo that's the G
He the real big homie, may he rest in peace
You was working, sweating, flipping burgers, getting checks per week
I was posted 30 in the toaster off of ecstasy
16 tryna get my check up, on the block freestyling
Now it's hard to hold my neck up, on the block freestyling
Niggas hate to see me in the league so they keep fouling
Soon as I get finished at the line (And one), I'ma keep wilding
Used to pray for days like this just to see my momma smile
Set examples for my sister, make my momma proud
I was in the field risking it with my niggas
We was screaming out No Limit
Moms tripping, it was going down
Just like '08 summertime, all the guys alive
East side hot, you ain't No Limit
Move da fuck around

[Hook]
We what's happening, we what's happening
Bout that action (haaa)
Every city they say "No Limit, bitch"
All on tour that go (yeah, they go)
Want a war, let's go (yeah, they know)
We don't give a fuck like Master P bitch yeah I'm so
Everywhere I go (No Limit)
Only thing I know (No Limit)
Bitch we on the map, yeah that's G Herbo
Yeah they see Herbo, (Wanna be Herbo)
We the gang and I'm No Limit MB G Herbo

[Verse 2]
Me, g-fazo, fero, big-buck at the smoke house
That's a throw back, my nigga veto selling blow packs they gon throw back
I'ma real l, real life that shit
Really tote them jocks I ain't write that shit
Niggas wasn't really in the hood like that
They don't even know what's a bosco stick
They ain't really been thru the pain like us
All they wanna do is keep the pasto lick (pastooooo)
I don't gangbang, I just bang L's with the same L's for like 10 years
Know some real niggas who ain't 20 yet, got like 10 years
I ain't 20 yet, but I'm still here
My Glock 23 full of steel led (I Got It)
And im ducking feds with a hundred niggas
That's a hundred fifty and 400 years
All i'm praying for is don't nobody tell (don't nobody tell)
And i've been in the streets so much that I don't like it
All the hurt in me, I try to fight it
It's hurting me, until the anger just burst in me
Homicide on the scene, first degree murder me
I ain't wanna do it, it was either him or me , I ain't wanna do it
And every nigga with me, got it ready too squeeze
Puss best believe, lot of weapons with me
Lot of killers with me, lot of felons with me
And we yelling same shit as master p
No limit soldiers with me and they gone for me
Posted over east, e-murder rollin' with me (hannn)
