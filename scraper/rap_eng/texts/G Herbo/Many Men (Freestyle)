Many men
Wish death upon a swervo
Left on a Glock right hand on the turbo
From the trenches either in a missle you a bozo
From where bitches set they nigga just for a fur coat
(Hold on lemme come in look I gotta stand up real quick)
I seen youngins fourteen go to school wit pipes
I seen niggas lose they life cause they ain't lose a fight
You know the streets is a maze gotta maneuver right
The shit you do on daily might not get you through the night
I was born in a world full of hatred if you got a weak mind youn make it
Boy you got a chance out betta take it
And if not then it's back to the basics
No heat roaches rats in the basement
It's like mom payin rent for a vacant
It's still more to have what she makin
(?)wit a soul full of hate hit the streets start takin
And youn know the streets like hades and youn know the streets life crazy
Homicides I done seen like 80 youngins cryin in the street my baby (uh hol on)
The rap game killed niggas, literally and turned gangstas into drag queens
They look down on workin hard like it's a bad thing
Shit I'm the last man standing if you ask me
I was just broke not long ago it feel like last week
Remember niggas in they benz ridin past me
I never hated I just used that shit as motivation
I was lost up in the streets I needed navigation
Ain't wanna be no doctor lawyer ended up a patient
Young nigga said fuck jordans when he copped the Soya
Ruth Chris three times a week I got tired of Goya
I'm from Chi-raq but I got killer niggas in the Nois'
I remember back when I was young nigga
Teacher stereotyped me as a dumb nigga
Now lil niggas wanna be like me
Tell em finish high school don't be like me
Dropped out but I hit a high IQ
I was on the 8 block totin' doing high speeds
Now I'm bossed up 150 DT
Niggas wanna see me gotta run it by me
I was broke in the hood tryna buy Gs
Trappin out in white tees tryna buy Nikes
And I'm still in the hood rockin white tees
All G-fazos still got on Nikes
End of day so I would've went crazy but the money and fame never changed me
Started rappin on some street shit
I was dead broke
Ain't nobody never gave me shit I had to sell dope
And when that shit get to movin slow we fuckin with the coke
I can't let them white folks lose me don't catch us wit elbows
I was on Essex in truey, now I'm rocking Balmain, It was me and Bibby , I'm 150DT, he rep boss bang
But I'm still NoLimit that's 150 too same thing as Boss Gang
Junkies come and go in both ways out the trap house then the law came
When I first start sippin drank that shit was 50 a deuce
Now that shit 4, 5  (?)
