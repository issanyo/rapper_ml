[Verse 1: Don Q]
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas
Look what I formed alone, ain't nobody had to put me on, nigga
I got my foot up on niggas, I hear 'em takin' the lingo (takin' the lingo)
My trap phone helped me get that designer before I was breakin' a single
My racks long, remember a nigga was literally breakin' a single (literally breakin' a single)
You know that yay gettin' mangled nigga, I hold that K at an angle
I gotta feed the team, you know I gave the blueprint to my niggas (give the blueprint to my niggas)
Watch how I flee the scene, I got 2 bitches inside of the Fisker
Who you think gave the ingredients? I am the one with seasonin' (the one with seasonin')
Yeah, my ego I'm feedin' it (feedin' it), I hope you niggas obedient (obedient)
Yeah, look a demon in his eyes, you'll never know what you see in it (you'll never know what you see)
Yeah, I pull up speedin' in the ride, no it don't come with a key in it (no it don't come with a key)
Yeah, but I smell like a ki in it, yeah, I look fresh off the border (fresh off the border)
Duckin' the feds and recorders (feds and recorders), you know I rest with the Taurus (you know I rest with the)
I keep some ice on my neck, I gotta stay with my head above water
Yeah, I'm mixin' Sprite with the Tech, constantly poppin' the meds that I ordered, yeah

[Chorus: Don Q]
(Talk to 'em) Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (we pullin' up whatever nigga you already know)
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (all kinda foreign shit)
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (fly shit, a true thug nigga, dripped out bitch)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
I was in the trenches, believe me
But I was blessed and finessed, so I make it look easy
Nah but this shit wasn't easy, I was in a shoot-out
I'm talkin' to Nicki, got flew out, I was right next to Weezy
And I gotta clutch when I meet you (when I meet you)
Might have my .40 to greet you (greet you)
Kept that lil' shake like a seizure
I'll go to New York, interview at Thisis50, and run up a 50 ball
Landed at Kennedy, no we couldn't fly with the blicky, ay dog, we need one of y'alls
Ain't got no enemies, fuck it still gotta keep it with me, might run into one of y'alls
Want smoke at this show, we gon' shoot this bitch and you know might as well don't even come at all
I been that nigga, turnt up my flex as a youngin', you know me and Somersault
Come put that shit up, at least a whole when you hit us, we flip it, no somersault
I fucked that shit up
Ran through a sack with my niggas, we here for a bunch of raw (yeah)
Ain't give no fuck I was tryna get fly, charged my cousin 8K for a hundred balls
When Fazo died and they pulled Zell over, he was like, "Fuck the law"
Pullin' up with freshman, they like, "Herbo, you a fuckin' dog"
Charmed all my teachers, shootin' dice in P.E, cheerleaders, fucked 'em all (you know this shit)
Still might get a C-D, 'fore I made a CD, I ain't give a fuck at all
Still in Chiraq with the GDs, yeah with the BDs, yeah I fuck with 'em all
Honestly, I don't give a fuck where you from, what you is, fuck with me then you fuck with the wrong one
Honestly I'ma just stop let you think 'bout your next move
You don't wanna leave your momma 'n 'em lonely
I'ma just aim at your top, give a fuck what the vest do
Any day you just come run up on me

[Chorus: Don Q]
(Talk to 'em) Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (we pullin' up whatever nigga you already know)
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (all kinda foreign shit)
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas (fly shit, a true thug nigga, dripped out bitch)

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I just went got me a Coupe, fuck that single shit went got me a group
Glock kick like BlocBoy when it shoot
Your family won't know til' it come on the news
I pop me one of them blues, all in my locker, my gun up in school (gun up in)
I'm in a good mood, I ain't wanna be rude (naw)
Just look at these rappers, you wanna see food
Listen, before the booth I was goin' through it in the kitchen
Tyson on the roof, I was lookin' for a pigeon
Givenchy to the shoes, first day up outta prison
She seen the roof dippin', [?]
Since nigga did Hpnotiq, foreign shit gettin' out it
Ahki I'm lookin' like bin Laden
Just wait till the price change, you think I ice skate, this ain't no hockey we been slidin'
Gelato too loud gotta Zip-Lock it
My money grew up, you got kid pockets
The coke is A-1, call it Len Bias
Tryn assault me, no emoji, send fire (fire)
I treat the back of the 'Bach like a studio, your bitch just gave me a mic test
Just come to the mansion, see all these Ghosts and these Phantoms, shit lookin' like Fright Fest
When I used to sip, it was just Pineapple Fanta if ain't no more Sprite left
Just work on your aim, if you a dependable hitter that's gon' be a nice check
Balmain got me rockin' these white sweats
They match the Off-Whites with the Nike checks
Ass bettin' that's a dice death, I see my future through the Pyrex

[Chorus: Don Q]
(Talk to 'em) Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas
Where you from? We gon' pull on niggas
