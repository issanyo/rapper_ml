[Intro]
Yeah
No, this a letter to my son
I had to write off the pad 'cause I done broke my phone
I ain't even gon' get another one honestly
I don't even care 'bout that type of stuff no more
That's slow stuff, it don't even matter
I got a shorty on the way so

[Verse 1]
I gotta change my ways
Might as well start to watch what I say
I grew up a bad example
Lately I can't smoke where I lay
I don't wanna set bad examples
All good, ain't no smoke with my lady
We at peace in the house burning sages
She just walking around saying prayers
In a few months, you'll be here in April
Brand new room for you, right now we making it
Even though I know you'll never stay in it
On the 48th floor where we staying at, that's just my lil' way of saying we making it
Daddy still gotta go hard to stay with it
Family all out of harm's way, we safe with it
Don't spend no more, lock the safe up, we saving it
Just so you straight, ain't it
I give you all that I am
Teach you all of the things that I learned on my own, but they made me a man
You ain't gotta grow up in the streets like I did, I lost the bestest of friends
I did make sacrifices for them
I did everything for everybody but myself and I felt like less of a man
Ain't gotta tote gats on Essex again
Lord sent a blessing, amen
Mama ain't stressing, amen
Put family first as long they do the best that they can
Just watch for the snakes, everybody that hate, wanna smile in yo face and watch what you make
Just 'cause you born great, in the womb eating steak
High seats in the Wraith and estates
Yeah, I bought yo mama a Range, 90K
I bought my mama a Benz, 60K
Just got pulled over in that Bentley today
Police trying to talk to me, ain't nothing to say, ay
I was just brought up that way
My dad taught me that at a very young age
Say, I want my lawyer today
Say, I want my father today (okay)
Everyday saw my Dad I was still on that A
Rebelled on my father, dabbed in that water
He ain't still fear my everyday
The more older I got, the less I did what he say
Ain't trying to teach you that way
I ain't trying to beat you I ain't, I'm gonna give you the game
Can't wait to see your lil face and meet you
I love you, you came from the blood of my vein
Give you food out my belly, clothes off my back
Plan your whole future I spend every stack
Hustle to get every bag, hustler, when you of age I'll tell you 'bout that

[Verse 2]
Just so you can understand my life
I got tired of wrong and started doing what's right
Ain't no more pouring codeine in my sprite
And now I'm up until 6 every night
No question for you I'ma ride
Play with my kid, homicide
All that bullshit to the side
I'ma be there 'til I die
And when I die, I'm gon still be right there with you, just hold your head to the sky
All you see red in mine
But it won't be no pain in your eyes
That's why I'm here to watch all your cries
G-Fazos in every size
My lil niggas swag gotta match mine
Baby, rollie time if I'm shining, you shine
Daddy on the grind, ain't gon be there all the time
Make your Momma happy, I don't see ma all the time
Seeing people say I don't believe all the time
That's because someone using me all the time
Only people I put my trust in is mine
Only people I'm stuck with is mine
And I only got money for mine
And ain't too much my money can't buy
My limit's the sky, this like a letter to mine
You ain't gotta come up and make all those stupid decisions like I
Ain't gotta thug to survive
I sold drugs to survive
Hurt some of my love ones, I lied
Me and my big cousin is fine
Still holding grudges in mind
Life too short son, just take your losses and ride
Life super short, son I'm just happy I'm alive

[Outro]
Yeah
It's crazy man, I'm finna have my first born son
You know we only raise young kings and queens, ya know what I'm saying
Gotta bring my son up how I was raised even better times 10
This for everybody trying to stay focused
Do you to provide for your family, ya know
Like I'm trying to do this for my family
Cause nothing gon' come from my family
I'm lay down right now and die for  my son and I ain't even ever met him
I'm out here ya know, protecting my girl, my girl can't even go to the grocery store right now while she pregnant
She can't fuck, she can't do nothing right now she pregnant
