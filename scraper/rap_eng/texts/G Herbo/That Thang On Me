[Intro: Alan Awesome]
'Kay I'm ridin' 'round with that thang on me
Okay I'm ridin' 'round with that thang on me
Okay I'm ridin' 'round with that thang on me

[Hook: Alan Awesome]
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star

Ridin' 'round with that thang on me (x4)

(Verse 1: Alan Awesome)
Now all my niggas thugs, the streets they show me love
These niggas trynna' fuck my sister juss' to get the plug
I keep a 30 on my lap everytime I'm pullin' up
My bitch be tweakin' doe like "Awesome put that up"
I say "Shawty wuuut?", this bitch must be nuts
All this ice around my neck they gon' try to stick me up
But I don't give no fuck, I juss' load 'em up
Send a nigga to the reaper then I see the judge

That's why I'm ridin' 'round with that thang on me
Big 'ol L's if a nigga wanna bang on me
I got a hunnit shots, some shirts put ya' name on 'em
You can catch me in the trap (?) 'caine on me

Now this a shout-out too my block nigga
Now this a shout-out if you shot a nigga (x2)

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Ridin' 'round with that thang on me
Hunnit shots don't need aim homie
Any nigga try to play around I lay 'em down for the gang homie
On the 9 servin' 'caine homie
Essex Ave. where I  bang homie so dont ride through I got that thang on me and I'm in the field with the same brodies
I got lots of money so I hit the club with a different Rollie'
Run up on me we gon' leave em holey
You know C-Money got that Eagle on him
You don't really wanna see me homie
I know you really wanna be me homie
You know I'm spendin' stacks so easy homie and yo' baby-mama wanna freak me homie
But dont keep it homie
I'm chillin' (?) and they sweepin' homie
This 40 Cal. will leave you weepin' homie
And I know why yo' bitch so freaky homie
'Cuz I got Louie for the sneakers homie
I'm ballin' while you in the bleachers homie
So you make thousands in a weekend homie, while I make thousands for a feature homie

[Hook: Alan Awesome]
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star

[Verse 3: Sly Polaroid]
Ridin' 'round with that thang on me
Every one of my chains on me, put a stain on me
Bitch you ready for your tombstone with yo' name on it?
Collect the rest of my extras, not a dime short I go insane
That presser next to that dresser, and that (?) for that foreign thang
My young niggas done lost it, whatever lines they cross it
We got John Gotti them bosses yes we John Gotti them bosses!
Eastside that's a mufucka'
Get deep-fried in that mufucka'
Police die in that mufucka'
Niggas cease fire in that mufucka'
My sweat made for them slugs sprayed and my blood made for that drug trade, these gloves made for that blood-take and that plug made for that floodgate
The Devil dance with my spirit Lord don't pass it on to my children
Real life in my lyrics
A hunnit shots, period

[Hook: Alan Awesome]
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star
A hunnit' shots up out that foreign car
You think you see a stain 'cuz you haven't seen a star
