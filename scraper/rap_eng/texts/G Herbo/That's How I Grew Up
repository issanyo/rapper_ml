[Intro]
Money callin' me, trouble followin' me
I'ma street nigga and I'ma always be
And my momma know I'm good so she don't pray for me
I'm just a street nigga and I'ma always be

[Chorus]
We was gangbangin', that's how I grew up
Out there sellin' work, that's how I grew up
Youngin' shootin' shit up, that's how I grew up
I put in that work, that's how I blew up
Man fuck them niggas, they ain't nothin' like us
We don't talk to cops, that's how I grew up
We just sit out box, that's how I grew up
All day on the block, that's how I grew up

[Verse 1]
On the Eastside of Chiraq, that's where I grew up
OG ain't let me on Essex until I grew up
When G Fazo died in 2010 I just ain't give a fuck
'Member me and Manski on the phone an hour teein' up
Fourteen we was young as fuck all ready to fuck shit up
Comin' up no fear in us, we ready to kill sum
Lil Roc died Rellski turned himself in for a year or sum
Trappin' so hard told em leave the line and watch us still run it
Back then I was sixteen probably running up a fifteen
Then I started spittin' 16s, rappin' 16s, by my 16th
Nigga 16 yeah them my blocks
Four blocks can't switch, four blocks that way
Four blocks up four blocks back
We run our shit and the opps
(Gang gang)

[Hook]
We was gangbangin', that's how I grew up
Out there sellin' work, that's how I grew up
Youngin' shootin' shit up, that's how I grew up
I put in that work, that's how I blew up
Man fuck them niggas, they ain't nothin' like us
We don't talk to cops, that's how I grew up
We just sit out box, that's how I grew up
All day on the block, that's how I grew up

[Verse 2]
You can't come where I grew up
Big ass guns where I grew up
They shoot for fun where I grew up
No where to run you fall you fucked
Wonder why your niggas never pull up
Never call you up
Ain't know who you calling for
No body want war with us
Literally, bullshit you not
Fo'nem go nuts with them Glocks
They don't even know how to stop
Knock that little shit off the top
Grew up fathers off the dope
Grew up mothers off the rocks
Errybody got a problem
Errybody got a opp
And I grew up just a screw up
Takin' drugs just to boot up
Totin' guns missin' court goin' on the run
Gangbangin' ridin' on opps just for fun
Pop in front of 'em masked up
Can't see my face just the gun

[Hook]
We was gangbangin', that's how I grew up
Out there sellin' work, that's how I grew up
Youngin' shootin' shit up, that's how I grew up
I put in that work, that's how I blew up
Man fuck them niggas, they ain't nothin' like us
We don't talk to cops, that's how I grew up
We just sit out box, that's how I grew up
All day on the block, that's how I grew up
