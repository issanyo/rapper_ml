[Intro]
(Oh my God who's this? L Beats)
Aye, aye, aye
150 Dream Team, RIP all my niggas man

[Hook]
I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me

[Verse 1]
I remember 16, told myself money was gon' do nothin' to me
I'ma get up a check and always be the same cause that shit wasn't nothin' to me
But my mama got bills and my sister 13 and they depend' on nothin' but me
So how the fuck money ain't nothin' to me when I know it ain't nothin' for free
And I come from the east ain't no love in the streets
Growin' up it wasn't nothin' to be
I was runnin' the streets, fell in love with the heat
Niggas never did nothin' to me
As a youngin' I grew up then broke in the hood with my niggas
And knew how to rap
Went to sleep at my grannies with roaches and rats
Then I woke up with 200 racks
Fuckin' offsides, gettin' fly every day sippin' Act'
And you know I went flat
Got in my zone and went up some more racks
Plus that 200 back
2015 is my year on the low, I just run up a few hundred racks
They don't give me my credit, they know that G Herbo the man, all I do is spit facts

[Hook]
I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me

[Verse 2]
I'm a hustler, Benz in my first 50k 'fore I travel these lil 50 states
Yeah they doubted me, said I was too in the streets, what I do? Run it up anyway
And I been in the streets and I made enemies
Can't get rid of what's pendin' to me
No Limit, we been right at east
Dream team boy, I've been MVP
And that's prolly why they envy me
I know niggas hatin', I see that they fakin'
I read it in they body language
They ain't gangsta for real, they ain't ready to kill
I can read it in they body language
And I got it on me, it don't matter beef, run up on me, leave your body stankin'
Hit them all, I got blood on my Masons
All this money is makin' me feel like I changed, thinkin' bout back in the days
When I used to feel like I could stay in the hood, get my money, and still be the same
But I'm still with the gang, just tryna stay in my lane and I move like a boss now
My whole family look up to me and I know if I fuck up it's only my loss now

[Hook]
I don't know what's becoming of me

I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
