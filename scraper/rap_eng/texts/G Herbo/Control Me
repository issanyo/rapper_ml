[Hook]
Everybody know me, know they can't hold me
He pop and flex, I'm rollin', let it control me
I can't stop drinking Rosé, just smoked a Stogie
You bet' not walk up on me, if you don't kno' me
Broski put them guns up, I might bug up
Don't make me call them thugs up and fuck your club up'
He pop and flex, I'm rollin', let it control me
You bet' not walk up on me, if you don't kno' me


[Verse 1]
Pop a whole, pop a half, bitch I'm bussin'
Niggas say they want my head, well they bluffin'
I can't say them niggas scared but it's somethin'
Cause half the niggas want me dead ain't doin' nothin'
Send hittas and they comin', now err'body duckin'
100 rounds, gun'em down, clear the scene ain't nothin' round
Then post up on Roc Block, me and Noochie smokin' loud
Or might be in that chop chop with 20 pigeons buss' it down
Catch me dashin' in a van or might flex in a rover
Tippin' all night, off a flat, never sober
Yeah I know that I can never lack or it's ova'
Thats why I keep Mally in the back with the toker
You don't wanna see how we react when we rollin'
Him and Mad Max in the lac' when it's stolen
Hittin' on the block, we'll be back, we'll be glookin'
Everything black, I bet Max and they blowin'

[Verse 2]
I can't control myself
I think I need some help but Ion' want no helping hands, Bitch, I just need myself
And I ain't into making friends, No, I just need my wealth
Fendi hold dat 40 up, So, Yea I need my belt
Hit the club wit' my dawgs, No, we not wit' y'all
We all just walked in here to ball but we not that tall
Throwin' bands, got yo' broad bouncin' off the walls
We go buy that bitch a bottle, watch her drop her draws
Bussin' hoes, disgustin' hoes
They just want a couple blunts to roll and they touch they toes
All I know is stack my fuckin' O's till they overload, Catch me in that Ferragamo store buyin' over clothes, countin' rolls
