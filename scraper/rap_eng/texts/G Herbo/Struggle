[Intro]
RIP all my niggas
I ain't had shit
I ain't had shit
Yeah, I came from nothing

[Hook]
I remember back when i ain't had shit
Now sometimes i forget when i buy shit
Young nigga yeah i came from nothing
This the reason why i wake up stuntin'
This shit for my grandma, this shit for my mother
This here for my sister, this for all my brothers
My no limit brothers
All we know is hustle we come from the struggle

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Young nigga all i knew was hustle stack and make that double
Ditching school, right to the corner, couldnâ€™t stay outta of trouble
Wit my niggas, toting hammers we ain't need no muscles
Make sacrifices for our brothers cuz we love each other
Got Glocks, we looking for the opps, watch out for under covers
If he get snatched up for that brother, bet he won't say nothing
Cuz i got niggas in the county, in the feds now
Answer the phone make sure i send them hunnits every time
And ain't no nigga gone make sure momma fed now
So you can't get shit for free bitch i need every dime
Picture me, black rari, forgiato rare tires
Member when we ain't have no car used to take the red line
Gherbo countin' all these bands now
1800 hunnit for my pants now
I was in the stu up all night just like a vampire
Think i forgot about my struggle? you a damn liar

[Hook]
I remember back when i ain't had shit
Now sometimes i forget when i buy shit
Young nigga yeah i came from nothing
This the reason why i wake up stuntin'
This shit for my grandma, this shit for my mother
This here for my sister, this for all my brothers
My no limit brothers
All we know is hustle we come from the struggle

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
At 14 it was cool, me and the guys was hoopin'
15 we started totin',then it turned to shootin'
Of course by 16 we was trappin'
Then i started rappin'
At 17 i started cashin'
Dont know how it happened
But i wouldn't call it magic
I spent it all like magic
More than i imagined
And ain't no nigga gave me shit
But they always askin'
And i dont owe a nigga shit
7 on me i'll loan a nigga 6
And in these streets haters dont wanna do nothing but bring you down
Im going hard and im stunting, i know they see me now
Yeah, im on TV now
Niggas wanna be me now
And im still the same nigga
I ain't changing
Still with the same niggas
Pistol gang yeah thats who i hang with
Smoking dope, sippin' drank, back when i was broke on that same shit
And i do this shit to put my people on nigga, fuck that fame shit

[Hook]
I remember back when i ain't had shit
Now sometimes i forget when i buy shit
Young nigga yeah i came from nothing
This the reason why i wake up stuntin'
This shit for my grandma, this shit for my mother
This here for my sister, this for all my brothers
My no limit brothers
All we know is hustle we come from the struggle
