[Intro]
Man
You supposed to be no stress in a world of stress
The one relaxation in a world of chaos

[Verse 1]
How it was when we first met
How it was, I can't recollect it
And I feel what you said when you felt neglected
If it’s gonna be like this, gotta just accept it
When you dealing with a nigga like me, you just gotta respect it
Ups and downs and shit, all that's expected
And when we argue back and forth, I let you get the best of it
I be more like, "What's all that for?"
You know I ain’t with that extra shit
All the time I look at my phone like, "Damn, why you texting?"
Matter fact I ain't even texting back
You know me, I ain't even stressing that
Spend a 40, you can have the rest of that
You ain't even ask for that
You ain't even gotta ask where the cash at
Just throw that ass back
You know I like when you ride that
Yeah, I like when you grab that
Yeah, a week at the chiropractor
All your friends know why you got a bad back
And you know I cock that slab back
Made the whole crowd back, back
I don't even care who right there
You know I'm gangsta like that

[Chorus]
Yeah, you still my baby
Even when you mad, you know you still my baby
Pull your hair and I smack that ass
You like how that feel, huh, baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I drive you crazy
But we still ridin', we crazy
And she like when I drive fast, no I ain’t driving Ms. Daisy
Then she like to ride it fast, we doing that on the daily
And she’s still my baby
(And she still my baby)

[Verse 2]
Girl you're still my baby
Don’t nobody do it like you when you put them heels on baby
And handlin' all this money, I ain't got nothin' to feel on baby
So take them heels off, baby
You know I love to watch them panties peel off, baby
Where you about to go, baby?
In order to get all this money, you know I got to go
Always think I’m up to something when I'm on the road
You know I walk in this bitch with a hundred, let's hit the store
Listen up, why you tripping though?
Who was with some hoes?
You know I miss you, though
I'm always with the bros
Always gotta hit the studio
I always got work to do, you know?
I'm getting back on the road, wish you could go
I got some secrets you should know
Not no shit deep as the hood go
Shit about going deep as I could go
Come hop on my mic and blow
Then I'm hoppin' inside the sauce
Yeah, you could do what you want
But I feel I got the right to know

[Chorus]
Yeah, you still my baby
Even when you mad, you know you still my baby
Pull your hair and I smack that ass
You like how that feel, huh, baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I drive you crazy
But we still ridin', we crazy
And she like when I drive fast, no I ain't driving Ms. Daisy
Then she like to ride it fast, we doing that on the daily
And she's still my baby
(And she still my baby)
