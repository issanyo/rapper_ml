[Hook]: U-Sity

Grab some loud and roll up
Double cups im poured up
Tell them niggas slow up
All my niggas poled up
You know us
Police can't control us
All my niggas soldiers
You gon have to show us

[Herb]

Eastside can't control us
Pull up, slide them doors back
Lil bro let the pole bust
Off a L im slowed up
Flame up some more blunts
Yo bitch say she wanna fuck, but she ain't even know us
Young nigga I love to flex
Spending racks and get it back
Lil bro let them glizzys clap
Cuz he ain't bout that chitter chat
We ain't bout that twitter pop
My niggas don't diddy bop
We just into gettin guap
Postin up and shooting Glocks-
We'll smoke a nigga top
Just sit back and news watch
My niggas blowin, you not
Make a call get you dropped
Niggas sweatin me like "dude hot
You going too crazy, dude stop"
And im worth a couple bandz
Just look at my new watch

[U-Sity]

Fuck folksnem, hit em up
Paramedics gotta get em up
Bad bitch and she thick as fuck
Give her a zip of loud and tell her roll it up
U-Sity get guap bitch
Cop a pack, hit the block shit
See this that bitch think she hot shit
Problem is dog, that she not shit
Hooked up with them doors up
On 6 and she chose us
Tell em slow up cuz im poled up
Tell her fuck her back, can't control us
Double cup with a 4 in
Tell them broke niggas get a load in
Gotta bunch of killas from the low end
Yell green light and they goin in
Fly as hell like a bird with me
Tell em roll up, I got Herb with me
Got some bad bitches, hit the curb with me
Moving slow as hell, got the syrup with me
Hold up, so its man down
10,000 lakes, see the man drown
Im the hottest out, nigga hands down
If you talkin cash, throw them bands now
