[Intro]
G Herbo, Swervo
Humble beast man, you know I'm just doing me, I can't complain

[Verse 1]
A product of my environment, of course I am
Walking with this torch I am
Still smell like gunpowder, straight up off that porch I am
Youngest nigga got up on his grizzy, without force I am
Go and cop that new Ferrari, 700 horse, I am
And I told my big bros, "let me see you run it up"
I don't give a motherfuck about them if they ain't one of us
Niggas, they ain't nothing like us
They wasn't on that block like us
They don't tote them Glocks like us
They won't die for Roc like us
Understanding, overhanded, get that money rubberband it
Count it first before you spend it
I don't think they comprehend it
Thinking about my big bro Crazy James, he got apprehended
All we know is blocka-blocka-blocka then the coppers had him
Can't forget my bro Da Roe, I love him like my mama had him
That night we lost Kobe on the 8 block, had that Glock beside him
Can't forget about them days and nights cause they made me
We survived the trenches, we was crazy

[Hook]
I was lonely, I was hungry, almost drove me crazy
Walked out the house and got right in the streets, that shit was crazy
Bullets flying right in front of me, that shit was crazy
Shooters diving right in front of me, my niggas crazy
Don't know how but I made at home, shit was crazy
Turned me out then eventually I just start going crazy
When I say I don't give a fuck they think I'm crazy
Don't blame me, I'm just a product of what made me

[Verse 2]
Used to post up on that corner
It was after midnight on a school night
30 clip right on us, Lord I promise, I'm just tryna do right
Tell me how you grew up, this my story, let me hear what you like
Bullet wounds in middle school, he just tryna protect his new bike
Now I did the presidential, I might go Patek with blue light
I might go Ben Frank the Mueller, make it work, curse out the jeweler
Golden links like Rick The Ruler
In your club, might able to rumor
Walk outside with sticks and rulers
Pull shit, be so quick to do ya
Anyway, I've been straight since a teen, literally
Fuck shit up, walk out tell 'em bill me, Hillary
You starving, we eating over here B
Get a piece
Closed mouths don't get fed, you a pussy, don't come near the G
And they say I'm crazy, me I say I'm brazy
Mom, pops, at home, the street life, that's what raised me
The streets they love me one day and the next I know they hate me
I love what I've become, I'm just a product of what made me

[Hook]
I was lonely, I was hungry, almost drove me crazy
Walked out the house and got right in the streets, that shit was crazy
Bullets flying right in front of me, that shit was crazy
Shooters diving right in front of me, my niggas crazy
Don't know how but I made at home, shit was crazy
Turned me out then eventually I just start going crazy
When I say I don't give a fuck they think I'm crazy
Don't blame me, I'm just a product of what made me

[Outro]
Almost drove me crazy
That shit was crazy
That shit was crazy
My niggas crazy
Shit was crazy
I just start going crazy
They think I'm crazy
I'm just a product of what made me
