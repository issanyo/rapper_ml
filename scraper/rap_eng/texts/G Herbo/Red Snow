[Hook]
I know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They stealin', robbin', living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snow

[Verse 1]
Look, I was born in the slums through the drugs and the bums
Lookin' up to thugs with the guns
Why they want for us to settle every first of the month
All the way until you tired of the crumbs
Kids getting up for school, they ain't setting no alarms
They wake up to the sound of the drums
And respect don't go too long nowadays
Man a nigga run a hood with a gun
I remember i was young, running wild with my niggas
We'll run around the hood just for fun
By eighth grade year, we was trapping stacking ones
Staying out for parties packing guns
.22's, .380's
.32's under the jacket, thought we was the Navy
Man we took on the hood, made them old niggas fall right in line
Man they thought we was babies
Back then had to think and react
Like a man as a boy that's what made me
I was ridin' for mine
We gon' die for the cause, I'm No Limit crazy
I was out in the field
Committing sins on my dawgs
Disobeying the law
Bitch no respect for the jakes, I won't rat if they paid me
And the fuck niggas lower than rats
In the streets doing hits whackin babies
You won't catch me with no gat in the streets
Niggas say they after me
Niggas say they whackin' me
But so far ain't no one got at me
G Herbo ain't with no rapping beef
If a nigga want me, clap at me
I used to have dreams with degrees
Growing up becoming a athlete
But instead I just ended on Essex
Lil' Roc rolled the swishers and cap had the heat
Pistol gang I keep my gat with me
Glo Limit, I got Cap with me
Kobe squad I still got act in me
Roc block ain't just a tat on me

[Hook]
I know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They stealin', robbin', living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snow

[Verse 2]
Red snow, you either dead or dead broke
And all the young'ins know is blow and sell that damn coke
They daddies dead or on death row and moms don't care or know
Where eight year old's get killed at candy stores, no damn remorse
Babies, mothers, grannies, aunts niggas don't fear no more
They ain't in the streets forreal, they don't care no more
These niggas ain't forreal, they ain't trained to kill
A lot of niggas really bitches, they just life takers
And they take the wrong lives, they ain't life savers
They ain't tryna get no money, they ain't bout paper
These niggas know me lowkey, lil' bro toting Glocks with lasers
He lost his heartbeat, doctors had to feed him anesthesia
I'm everywhere from Lakeshore to Cicero, nothing major
He told you that he run the city, yeah he might have played ya
Don't know nigga run the city, we all from the city
The murder cap, closing your eyes'll get you gunned down quickly
And all my niggas gun down quickly, catch you run down empty
Get high off lean, smoke pounds of OG for our fallen homies
I'm gone off Remy, smoking pasto, got that blammer on me
Bro'nem told me, "Yo G Herbo, can't be by your lonely

[Hook]
I know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They still in robbing, living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters hard cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters hard cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snow
