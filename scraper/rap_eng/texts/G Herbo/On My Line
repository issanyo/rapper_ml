[Hook : Lil Uzi Vert]
Bust-bustin' traps on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Had-had your bitch all on my phone
Then she gave me dome
Tra-tra-trappin' on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Your bitch on my phone
That bitch give me dome

[Verse 1 : Lil Uzi Vert]
Gave me dome, gave me dome
Off the shits, I don’t know
What the fuck you sayin'?
Jumpin’ in the Rolls, sippin’ on this Rose
2-2-3 and balls, all my diamonds close
Chains look like snow and them bitches go
All my bitches hoes, they be sniffin’ coke
I don’t sniff no coke
Trippers have ahead, Glizzy with the sticks
Forty five with balls, you ain’t really know, I was with the shits
Now you really know
Speakin’ two different languages
And made it out of joke, xanny, eyes closed
Ballin’ like I’m Sammy, chillin’ in Miami
I just need a Grammy
Chillin’ on the ocean, pussy to be flowin’
She ain’t got no panties
You’ll be on the floor, I am not an human
All this be just splattin’
Boy you still let me
My own niggas trappin’

[Hook : Lil Uzi Vert]
Bustin' traps on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Ha-had, your bitch all on my phone
Then she gave me dome
Tra-tra-trappin' on my phone
These junkies won’t leave me 'lone
Your bitch on my phone
That bitch give me dome

[Verse 2 : G Herbo]
All of my bitches they fine and they right
Still suck my dick the first night
Sippin Rosé cause I’m not gettin’ high
Mix the codeine with the sprite
Hoes on my dick, try to fuck and I'm wasted
I think I'm Future, No Basic
Can’t fuck that bitch if she basic
Like have a brick from my bracelet
Pull up tryna stunt in a wraith
Pull up try to race on my stripe
Yo bitch let me fuckin’ it straight
Disrespect her and  bustin’ in face
Money thats one thing thats gonna stay on my mind
I give her all of my time
Touch that bitch til I’m all on my way but I lie
She don’t distribute  a dime
And you drop but you never stop hittin’ my line
I got you go strippin’ on line
They don’t got me, just sit on and last
Thirty shot clips on that
Try to run and get hit in the splat
If you jug you get hit and get splash
It gets me up in the hood, post it up with my ice and my gun with my nigga
