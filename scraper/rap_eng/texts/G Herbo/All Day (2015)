[Verse 1: Johnny May Cash]
Okay it's cool
These niggas better play it cool before they make the news

Bad bitches, scrap bitches, going for the squad
There are too many hoes all around me all these bad bitches finna get drunk
She say she a funny bitch and she a funny bitch man they all stuck up
If you don't give a fuck put your middle fingers up and my squad turnt up
So nigga what's up?

[Hook: Johnny May Cash]
How you niggas eating if a nigga take ya bricks and my niggas gotta take ya down
