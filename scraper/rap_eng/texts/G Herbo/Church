Uh, I'm taking niggas to work

Lets take em to Church, amen
Hallelujah for the real niggas
[Spillin?] out the plate i'll have my shooters go and deal wit em
I'm taking niggas to church, amen amen
I'm taking niggas to church, amen amen
Hallelujah for the real niggas
[Spillin?] out the plate i'll have my shooters go and deal wit em

[G Herbo aka Lil Herb]
Threw the Chevy on some 8's to hit the strip on a sunday
Got 8 balls for the low and hold chickens on monday
150 stay behind me
My youngins riding like [Funday?]
And all my killas grimey, ain't no deciding bout gunplay
I been a real nigga since i was a lil nigga
So i miss my mill ticket shorty ima still get it
Yeah, cause I do it for my family and niggas on the grind with me
In the field with the steel, so that mean my niggas ride for me
Bitches kill or be killed
You must be real to see real
Everybody say they real well how it feel to be real?
Everybody say they kill well how it feel to be killed?
They try to throw me a deal, I need some mill for these skills
When I went to church pastor made me spit a verse
But she said I couldn't curse long story short that didn't work
Sorry
Pull up in that foreign, skrt
These niggas hurt, Rari
They bitches lurk like, "Herbie can I come to church?"
