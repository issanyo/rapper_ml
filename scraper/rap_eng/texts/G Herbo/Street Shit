[Intro]
It's no limit to this street shit
Free all of my niggas that got caught up in the street shit
And shout out all the niggas that was brought up in the street shit
R.I.P. my niggas that I lost up in the street shit
But still I love that street shit
Addicted to the street shit, no snitchin in the street shit
No bitchin in the street shit, just killin in the street shit
No feelings in the street shit
Im always in the streets
And I always got the heat
And I'm always over East

[Verse]
Got no limit and it's no limit to this street shit
Got the whole city on MB dick
Since I threw Reese on the remix
But I been doing this rap shit and street shit
You can always catch me over east with it
And my niggas shoot for no reason
Cause the opps got poor defense
If we hit a nigga no breathing
This street shit, it got into me
So I'm ridin' out with my enemies
Finna' do a nigga like Kennedy
That's assasination, pull up on him that's a scary sight
My young boys be all on that
Tryna' wack a nigga like every night
Pick the mags up better mask up
These niggas singing like Barry White
Yeah they snitch niggas
And alot of niggas tryna get with us cause they know we finna be some rich niggas
But I only fuck with my real nigga
That I been with since lil niggas
If they want war go deal with 'em
It ain't shit for us to go and kill niggas
But I ain't never ran from no real niggas
Catch him snoozin then run him up
We scorin' shit we ain't ever losin'
The beretta shooting then you better duck
I ain't lying neither
Alot of niggas out here getting shot
Say you on the block I ain't hiding either
And I'm posted up with 150
Gotta couple techs
Gotta couple macs
Gotta couple k's
And a couple semi's
Off a lot of loud smoking out the pound
With a 4 of lean and a cup a remy
Probably gettin top from a white bitch
While a dyke bitch come and suck her titty
Paid 450 for the Robin Jeans
Aain't another young nigga fuckin' with me
They like Lil Herb? He a street nigga
You want beef with em better sleep with em
And a lot of niggas on the same thang
Saying bang bang just 'cus Keef did it
