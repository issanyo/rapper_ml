{Willie D}
Mama's outside, barbecuing ribs and links
It's Juneteenth, but to me it don't mean stink
It's a day of emancipation, but everybody wonder why
Willie ain't celebrating
But things ain't perfect
I'm looking beyond the surface
So instead of drinking beer, and playing Dominoes
I'm sitting in the room with my eyes closed

(chorus - K-Rino - some Jamaican)
White man and the mental yet ta black ol'shade
White man and the mental yet ta blacd ol'shade?
For tellin' black mon no matta the dum'smarta rich
If the matta mo'mon jus a white mon's bitch
De givin us crack to let the ghetto people
Coming to the problem of the world
Blaming racial discrimination when they fuckin' up the self
Willie D slap the thigh, and K-Rino crack despise
Black mon get the government dick out ya eyez

(Willie D)
Follow me now, see, as I get a little deeper
They think I'm a drug dealer, cause I wear a beeper
But if I wasn't black, and I talked all proper
They probably think I was a doctor
I try to have the finest things in life
But when I get'em, they say I'm not living right
They search my house and car for no reason
Like it's muthafuckin' goddamn nigga season
And it is when U think about it
They hurt yo'ass, treat U like an animal, and bragg about it
It's like a cop turnin' vicious as a 12-gauge
No wonder why he gets his picture on the front page
Now even if you're light, and damn near white
You'll get smoked, B-cuz yo' in the same boat tryin'
To surround yourself with white
Folks in your video
Like Paula Abdul she's a silly ho
Although U only might be one-percent black troop
They still consider you a mook
But she say's she ain't black, so how da'FUCK she figga?
Yo bitch, u still a nigga

(chorus - K-Rino - some Jamaican I imagine???)
Government broke in my house with they guns
So they busin' and breakin' cos' they paid to no one
Now they have a murder rap and they makin no stros
So I'm facin' incarceration in the police station
There wasn't a bitch or a wicked assassin
Since they comment homicide
Offering to tend protection
Resist conviction
Cos the shot from da'honest white mon
Now to hear some muthafuckin run

(Willie D)
True niggas retaliate, they don't run
I say we niggas 'cos they treat us like scum
So get a nose job like Michael Jackson
Go to a white school, and change your accent
U STILL A NIGGA, so how da'fuck U figga
Since U moved out da'neighborhood
And datin' a peckerwood
That you're different from the rest of the clan
Tryin' to get a job, and count how many doors slam
Goddamn, I'm on a row
I can't forget about my bald head hoes
To some, it's a fashion
To wear weave and pony tails
But the other hoes wanna be white girls
Whodini said "Be Yourself, Trooper,"
U don't see white folks tryin' to act BLACK do ya
So why U laughin' at the brotha in dreads
U neet to get the chemicals out yo'own motherfuckin' heads!
No matter how U aim and change your game
And rearrange your frame, U STILL A NIGGA!!!
