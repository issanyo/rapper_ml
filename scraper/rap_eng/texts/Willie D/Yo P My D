Competition and money (Bitches and money)
You owe me

[Hook: James Brown from 'Ain't It Funky Now']
Fellows, we got to let the girls know what they gotta do for us
This one got to be a drag man, a man can do nothing no more
Hahaha hahaha

[Verse One: Willie D]
Hey bitch, hey whore, hey tramp, hey slut
Tell me what the fuck is up?
Everyday you bitch, bitch bitch bitch
Want that, want this, like the motherfucker's rich
Always looking from something from Willie D
But what the fuck have your broke-ass giving me?
Nothing but complex and drama
I got enough of that shit when I was living with my mama
We got a crib so we're living together
We're two grown folks, things all will be better
Still we have is the same old mood
Want me to pay the rent, want me to cook the damn food
Bitch, you got me fucked up
I ain't Baby's Face, I like to fuck up the place
What I look like doing the chores?
What you think I got your dumb-ass for?
It damn sure ain't your bust slut
Cause I can jack-off and get a motherfucking nut
Pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone
Niggas fuck it, dykes suck it, and faggots leave it alone
So get on whore, you ain't nothing but a trouble maker
Here's your motherfucking welcome paper
And if dollar money is what you're thinking
You fuck around, and come up stinking
And that goes for the rest of you whores
Willie D'll tell you if you ain't been told
Loudly shit, just like this
Your pussy, ain't no more important than my dick

[Chorus]
My pussy - my dick, my pussy - my dick
My pussy - my dick, my pussy - my dick
My pussy - my dick, my pussy - my dick

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Hey bitch, hey whore, hey tramp, hey slut
Why you think that you're so damn much?
Your face looks good, and your ass is a working butt
But your motherfucking nose's going off
I saw you when I saw you're looking fly
Didn't say Hi! - I passed your ass right on by
Since I didn't make the first move
You told all your fucking buddies that I had a fucky attitude
Whores just like the satisfaction
Of turning niggas down, so I start asking;
Do you have a man? - do you wanna dance?
I glued my ass to a judge in standing lance
Cause I know what you whores about
You're looking for the man with the car, and the big home
So he can support, you and your baby
Boils money on dumb-dumb shit and go crazy
But you can't get Willie D
I'm looking for somebody who can help not hurt me
You like your naughty way without a doubt
Always got your motherfucking hands out
My birthday was not long ago
And all I got from your dog-ass, is I didn't know
Now yours here, and you're telling me this whore
(Where's my birthday's gift?) it's at the goddamn store
So suck a nigga's dick, or make a nigga rich
And treat me like you wanna be treated bitch
You get's no more thing to come with
Cause your pussy, ain't no more important than my dick

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Hey bitch, hey whore, hey tramp, hey slut
Don't duck, you know you like to suck and fuck
But some suckers don't know this
So you take them to hoop with the girl next door shit
Playing that motherfucking innocent role
Known all the time you like lick the booty hole
I won't beg your ass, it ain't my nature
Play them games with me bitch and I'll rape you
But then again, I ain't going like that dear
Cause I can get pussy anywhere
A lot of girls wanna be with Dee
Once more dumb-whore, they're all be paying me
I state your fate, because you got a pussy
And when you go out that's an automatic drink
I'm tired of this ladies night shit
When it's the butts, that's making these motherfucking clowns rich
Buying your breath as much again, it's too much
Yo bitch, I'll go dutch
So why you're trying to be malicious?
I pay my half and leave your ass washing dishes
And that goes for the rest of you whores
Willie D'll tell you if you ain't been told
Loudly shit, just like this
Your pussy, ain't no more important than my dick

[Chorus]

[Hook: James Brown from 'Ain't It Funky Now']
Fellows, we got to let the girls know what they gotta do for us
Fellows, fellows, we got to let the girls know what they gotta do for us

[Chorus]
[Outro]
My dick! - my dick!
My dick! - my dick!
MY DICK!!
