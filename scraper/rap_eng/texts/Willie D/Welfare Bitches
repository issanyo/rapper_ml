[ 'welfare bitch' 1 ]

[ VERSE 1: Willie D ]
Dee's about to cold get funky
On you welfare bitches around the country
I don't give a damn if you like me or not
But this bullshit you're doin has got to stop
You're playin the government for a sucker
What you don't know is they're hip to you muthafuckas
Droppin babies one after another one
Just to increase your funky-ass income
Welfare bitch, welfare bitch if you could see
For this purpose, cause I believe
That a child should be born out of love
Dumb-ass bitch, you was only thinkin of
The money which is for the kid indeed
But you took it and satisfied your own damn needs
You ain't about shit, you only love uno
One of these days there ain't gonna be no

Welfare
Yeah
Welfare bitches

Welfare
Yeah
(Keep away from)
Welfare bitches

[ VERSE 2: Willie D ]
Sit around gettin high and drunk
Waitin on the muthafuckin first of the month
They never looked for a j-o-b
Cause they're too busy watchin the soaps on ABC
You realize it's only make-believe
But yet when one died get shocked and grieve
Think Scorpio or Lucy or the rest of the crew
Give a fuck about a po' broke ho like you?

Welfare
Yeah
(Keep away from)
Welfare bitches

[ VERSE 3: Willie D ]
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
Will trade foodstamps in a jet flash
A $65 bill get you 50 in cash
They're the muthafuckas that's makin it hard
For the people who really need the government involved
They have their kids lookin a mess
While they walk around sportin Gucci and Guess
You say you love your kids, that's a goddamn lie
I said it, you wanna know why?
Cause you'se a welfare bitch, a welfare bitch
So is your man
Here's his muthafuckin plan:
He don't have to work as long as he sees
A welfare bitch that supports his needs
He get the three p's every goddamn day:
Pussy, pay, and a place to stay
You're a sorry muthafucka if you live this way
You need your ass whipped, that's what I say
I ain't livin life with a dumb po' broke ho
Willie the kid don't fuck with no

Welfare
Yeah
(Keep away from)
Welfare bitches

[ VERSE 4: Willie D ]
Welfare bitches can't do a muthafuckin thang for me
But suck my dick, cause I don't want the pussy
You fuck em one time and the goddamn whores
'll get pregant and swear up and down that it's yours
I got the money so you wanna get hit
Don't tell me that you're pregnant cause I ain't claimin shit
Don't try to play me cause I can't be pussy-whipped
So stay out my face and get off my dick

(I tell you, mister
I keeps me a welfare bitch
How ya think I got this Benz?

You can ask your mama there
I always get the three p's
She give me the damn three p's every goddamn day
Bitch treat me better than she treat her kids
You know

And ask em do they know [Name]
They'll tell you

Ask your daddy, he was there

You can ask anybody who runs the welfare bitches in the Ward
