[Hook:]
Kick that shit
Kick that shit
Kick that shit
K-K-Kick that shit

[Verse 1: Willie Dee]
I'm kicking this shit for you bitches and hoes
Running round like you're twelve years old
Got babies that'll you'll never see
Cause you're too damn busy running the streets
Fucking every Tom, Dick and Harry
You think you got 'em locked but that's on the contrary
They don't give a damn about a whore
They only want to fuck you bitch cause that's all that you're good for
You roll with your tramp ass friends
Playing any sucker with a Jag or a Benz
Before you know it you're at the motel
Sucking his dick cause you a fifty dollar trick
A ho with no heart being torn apart
By material things you think that you're smart
But you might as well face the truth
You're nothing but a motherfuckin' prostitute
Giving up the pussy for some money
You better be ready cause your day is coming
That's with all the shit that you did in the past
Creeps up on your nasty ass
In other words you're shit out of luck
Cause a bitch like you had life fucked up
Got busted now your face is disfigured
Cause you had here nigga, there nigga everywhere nigga nigga
You don't look so cute these days
Your tired ass body looks as one of decay
Now you walk around like a sap
Cause a nigga done put them things on your ass

[Interlude 1:]
Yeah I'm kicking this shit straight up yo ass
No beating around the mother fucking bush cause I don't like his old ass anyway
Yeah, it's gettin' closer to the time for me to start spittin' some game
To all you ho ass niggers that think you up on the game
But don't know a mother fucking thing

[Verse 2: Willie Dee]
Drop the god damn act and stop trying to be cool
And listen to me old stupid ass fools
I'm tired of you dumb ass niggers
Killing one and other over these nothing-ass bitches
It shows you ain't got no game
Pussy ass punk, take your dick out your brain
While you in jail facing life or death
The bitch you killed for'll be fucking somebody else
You listen to me with a chuckle
But you don't get old being a stupid mother fucker
I'mma let you off the hook like this
You're nothing but a sorry ass son of a bitch

[Hook:]
Kick that shit
Kick that shit
Kick that shit
K-K-Kick that shit

[Verse 3: Willie Dee]
I'm kicking this shit up the police asses
Trigger happy mother fuckers always blasting
Innocent people they closed the file
Because the states never made the motherfuckers a trial
We killed them and it's a little situation
But they killed us and it's a paid vacation
I tend to say this when I kick that shit
All you hoes can suck my dick
You say I'm starting shit, but so what?
I'm down like the crown, ain't no fear in my heart
To every cop on the force that killed my home boys wrong
Fuck you and the horse that you rode in on

[Interlude 2:]
Yeah all you scary ass hoes thinking the police gon' do this to me
The KKK gon' do that to me: wrong answer
Willie Dee gon' let his mother fucking nuts hanging
Fuck them hoes
Yo, we got a lot of Uncle Tom mother fuckers out there
Praising and demonstrating against the skin heads
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm on that other level
(Kick the, kick that shit)

[Verse 4: Willie Dee]
I'm kicking this shit just like Ready Red said
I beat the fuck out a mother fucking skinhead
Then I giggle and laugh and even chuckle
Cause I don't give a fuck about them bald-headed motherfuckers

[Outro:]
