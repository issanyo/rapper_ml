[Intro: Sho talking to Willie D]
Will, there go that squallie I been telling you about man. I've been trying and trying, she won't give me no action
[Willie D] Yeah, just step to her and spread your hustle, that's all ya gotta do
[Sho] Yeah but...I ain't got the platinum album and the Lexus. I ain't got your pockets
[Willie D] Ya see it ain't always 'bout that baby. Conversation rule that nation. Just step to her man. The worst she can do is say no. And that'll be her loss

[Verse One: Sho]
Miss Thang
Girl you know you're too much
Been trying to knock the boots for the past three months
I done peeped your game but I'mma tell the whole world
Like Gina, you know you can go girl
You in the club, rain, sleet or snow
Got them daisy dukes on when it's 20 below
Been around the way and back
And been in everybody and they cousin Cadillac
But you still got class
They call you fast but I don't know one brother that got the ass
Make me wonder who macking who
Everytime I see you, fresh clothes, fresh hair doo
You're juicing all the sugar daddies
I done seen a lot of stars but I think you the baddest
Never seen a pair at the club
And everywhere she go, Miss Thang gets lots of love
Her and her girlfriends all in sync
Never seen Miss Thang buy a drink
Every brother in the place got the same aim
And that's to get with Miss Thang

[Hook: Sho] {x2}
Miss Thang I don't have a lot of money
Miss Thang I don't drive a fancy car
Miss Thang I don't have much to offer you
But I still wanna knock the boots

[Verse Two: Sho]
Miss Thang
Why you all up on the paid brothers?
Don't you know broke brothers make the best lovers?
Gotta hit it right for you to come back
Can't trick ya, ain't got it like that
But if you come to the crib
I bet I hit it right
Have you walking with a flashlight in daylight
Looking for mo'
Trying to get some mo', find out why they call me Sho', yo
If I get in the socks, I bet it won't be a fling though
You ain't never had mandingo
Don't got a lot of money, but I got a job
I ain't robbing but a brother ain't starving
Got the three B's and I don't regret it
A bucket, a bus card and bad credit
I ain't all that and I don't deny it
But Miss Thang don't knock it till you tried it
Cause while you'll walking 'round looking down your nose
You might be passing up a pot of gold
So quit acting tight with the poontang
And give it up for a brother, Miss Thang

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Sho]
Miss Thang
See you're doing your bag and ya pager
Is there anyway I can persuade ya?
To give me the digits or a few minutes
I'm like you, my conversation got game in it
Stop acting all saditty all the time
To talk to a brother for a second don't cost a dime
Hear me out and what I got to say
I'm like Calgon, girl I'll take you away
But not to a real expensive place though
I'm just an average young brother from the ghetto
It shouldn't matter where we go when I take ya out
It's not the gift it's the thought that counts
Miss Thang, just need to be tamed
You don't need a dime if ya got an ounce of game
Cause no matter how large you get fellas
You'll always find there's a gal on another level

[Hook] {x4}
