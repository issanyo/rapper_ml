[Intro:]
This song right here is for my mama
It's the hardest song I ever wrote in my life
I must have cried a million tears
I wasn't going to write it at first but
I figured if I could do a song recognizing everything else
It's only right to write about the woman who gave me life
So this is dedicated to my mama and all the other mama's that aren't here today
Straight from the heart, straight from the heart

[Verse 1: Willie D]
I got a call in the waiting room from the nurse
Telling me to come upstairs cause my mamma's worse
I was at my baby's bedside in a flash
But the look on their faces told me she passed
And everything went blank, I couldn't think
I couldn't believe even though she wasn't breathin'
And the life support machine was turned off
And the tubes removed from her nose and mouth
I started tripping and my step father walks in
And states, let her go son she's in a better place
She ain't suffering no more, let her go I won't
I should feel good for her but I don't
Cause she didn't deserve to go like that G
I wonder why the good Lord didn't take me
But instead, I was picking up the telephone
Calling up sisters and brothers telling them mama gone

[Hook:]
Drove a hearse, hearse Cadillac
Crowd of people gathered 'round dressed in black
Drove the hearse, hearse Cadillac
It had my precious mother in the back

[Verse 2: Willie D]
Ever since you left here things done changed
Christmas, New Years and Thanksgiving ain't the same
Without your button smile and sister ?
And everybody missed you at the family reunion
Especially me, I tried to play strong
Looked around didn't see you, couldn't stay long
Cause there's tears in my eyes from your death
And if I'm going to cry I'mma cry by myself
It hurts me to drive to your grave sight
And visit on your birthday, but it's only right
I can't believe that your name is on the stone
Buried in the ground, when mother's day roll around
Now that you're gone I realise
How much pain and misery you went through because of me
Going to jail, raising hell getting kicked
Out of school for fights and keeping you up late at night
When you had to go to work the next morning
So I could have food to eat and shoes on my feet
And a place to stay but being young and dumb
I couldn't understand it so I took it for granted
I had a wedding and you missed it boo
My little baby girl blew a kiss at you
She never got to see her granny
But I told her but your spirit and if she call your name you can hear it

[Hook:]
Drove the hearse, hearse Cadillac
Crowd of people gathered 'round dressed in black
Drove the hearse, hearse Cadillac
It had my precious mother in the back

[Verse 3: Willie D]
Be good to your momma while you still got her
Hug her and kiss her cause when she gone you're gonna miss her
I wish I could have went first
Cause words can't express the pain that I felt when I saw the hearse
Drive off with my momma inside
Taking her for a last ride
I nearly died, cause that's how I felt boss
Putting the gun to my head and blowing the mother fucker off
But she would have wanted me to be strong
Though teared up, not ? up, and lift my chin up
She would have told me get your money, keep making moves
And take care of your nieces and your nephews
Mama you're gone, it's hard being without you
It ain't a day that goes by I don't think about you
Everybody said count your blessings
Well, but they don't know how I feel

[Hook:]
Drove the hearse, hearse Cadillac
Crowd of people gathered 'round dressed in black
Drove the hearse, hearse Cadillac
It had my precious mother in the back

[Outro:]
There it is
I remember the day the lord took you away
It was yesterday, whole world collapsed
It was like all the ?? and the resentment that I felt for you
When you treated me bad didn't even matter
You having problems with your momma, you got issues?
Y'all talk it out, call her go visit
Do something right now cause tomorrow ain't promised
It won't be the same when momma gone, nobody like momma, nobody
