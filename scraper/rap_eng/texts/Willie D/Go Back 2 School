[Intro:]
[BOY:] What's up Willie D?
[WILLIE D:] What's up? Why you ain't in school?
[BOY:] Man, I don't know

[Verse 1: Willie D]
Little man, let me tell you something
'Cause it seems nobody can you nothing
God damn head, hard as a rock
You like to hang out, skip school and smoke pot
Well that groove ain't hitting
Fucking around with your buddies bullshitting
Going to school just to skip school
You either shit, or get off the pot fool
'Cause it ain't cool no mo'
Just to be the bad ass everyday Joe
And you wonder why times are so hard
Can't read, can't write, can't get a job
Poopin out the ten commandments
And you got more beef than a mallet
Mad at the world like it owe you something
Well get ready for the fucking
'Cause the world ain't going to stop turning
'Cause it ain't yearning for you to come up so start learning
That you got to play ball room
Throw your ass back to school

[Verse 2: Willie D:]
I went looking for a job last summer
Found out Mc Donalds wanted a plumber
I thought about selling some dope but not for long
'Cause now food's doing day for day strong
And that ain't me so I refuse my options
Be an engineer rappers run fox
Either way I needed an education
To not get fucked out the back and that I'm makin'
Yes school is glad
And the teachers sometimes mad
But it's up to you to make the grade
'Cause teacher teacher already paid
Hate to bust your bubble
But ain't nothing on them streets but trouble
And that's easy to get into
But you'll go loco trying to get out bro
You're smarter than Doreen
Put your mind to it and you can be the ??
Don't be no fool
Stop cheating yourself, go back to school
