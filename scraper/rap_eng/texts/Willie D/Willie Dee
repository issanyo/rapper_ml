[Verse One: Willie Dee]
Five-oh's on my mother fucking back
Cause I'm a young black with a badass Cadillac
I can't ride on the mother fucking street
Without being harassed by some bullshit police
Fucking with me like a thug
Pulling me over for suspicion of drugs
They look dumb when they see I ain't got none
So they take me down for the shotgun
That I keep in the front seat
For any dumb mother fucker who fucks with me
Charge me bitch, give me a run
I'll be out before the mother fucking paper works done
Having fun with my friends
Doing the same old shit all over again
Cause I ain't being played like a sucker
By no doughnut-eating chicken white mother fucker
They can't stand to see a brother making
I ain't go no keys so stop fucking with me
Before you make me mad
And I'll put out a hit to take care of your ass
I bar none, motherfucker
If I catch you in street clothes I'mma bust a
Cap on your ass for making me disgusted
That'll teach your ass not to fuck with

Hit me!

[Verse Two: Willie Dee]
I'm a lover not a fucker
Bitches on my dick like a tight-ass rubber
Keeping my shit hard as wood
Not because I eat 'em good, because I treat 'em good
Chop chop chopping motherfuckers up
Hardest motherfucker, he don't give a fuck
?? down with me
Combined we kick more ass than HPD
Get down for the crown in a second
Ain't the average face mother fucker on a racket
Live the life that I sing about
Make a stupid ass move and you'll find out
I don't give a fuck where you come from son
I ain't taking shit off of nobody, cause I'm

(Fuck with me)

[Verse Three: Willie Dee]
Can't act a mother fucking fool
So don't put me in the god damn mood
Bum rushing is ho shit
All the bad motherfuckers are dead, and that's no shit
I ain't playing on another man's wishes
I'm too busy fucking with the bitches
Would I give a damn if my friend fuck my gal?
As long as he told me, we still pals
Let it slide, cause I'm on another level
But get your bitch ass for times get better
And let her stupid ass go
Cause one ho don't stop no god damn show
I send her ass through a trauma
When I pack her shit and send her back to her momma
Cause I'd rather have an ugly chick
Then a hard-head fine-ass pretty bitch
Who ain't down, want me to hound
Like her pussies the only one in town
I tell a bitch to get on
Cause pussy ain't nothing but meat on a bone, to Willie Dee

[Interlude:]
Yo, I don't understand these stupid ass mother fuckers beating on their woman's for fucking on them
But still come on like a mother fucking punk come for sucking dick
Why the hell you wanna give a bitch a A when she deserves a C
It's time for you mother fuckers to listen to me

[Verse Four: Willie Dee]
I got three bitches who know each other
But it's cool, cause I'm a motherfucker
I take them out spend a lot of money
But ain't no damn bitch gonna run me
They give each other respect
Whoever fucks up, I put them in check
So before you clown you should know this
She might be your gal, but she's my bitch
Hoes watchin' drug dealers die
And mosey on down to the next damn guy
All your friends think "girl you look stunning"
But bitch your turn is coming
Fight over a bitch, what for?
I lose one and gain seven more
(You's a lying mother fucker) I'll a sure you I'm not
Bitch stop sucking my dick tell 'em what I got

[Outro:]
Seven women in the palm of his hands, Willie Dee
