Hook: (Child computer voice)

Dear God really hate to bother you
I know that your really busy but
Can you take some time to see about me

Verse 1:

Dear God I know u got things to do
But can I talk to you, for a minute or two
I'm tired of seeing my homies dying
Bullet shells, paramedics, and chalklines
My friends momma sell they body, to pay the rent
My little cousin doing time but he's innocent
We sending food and money over seas to feed the po'
But what about the people next do'
Will you please show mercy on the child that's being abused?
Don't let 'em make the ten o'clock news
My attitude won't allow me to condone this
What we gone do about the homeless
I see peace
But I'm constantly engaged in conflict
I'm trying hard not to let the gun click
I really wish
U find in ya heart, to make a change
Hate to bug you but I'm tired of the pain

Dear God really hate to bother you
I know that your really busy but
Can you take some time to see about me (I'm tired of the pain)

People down here suffering
I know that I'm not an angel but
Can you take some time to see about me (I'm tired of the pain)

Verse 2:

I'm seeking the father in this wicked land, man
I'm a believer so I stick to praying
But when I wanna go outside
Momma say don't go
Cause it ain't safe for the kids to play no mo
The po-po's put my hands on they hot hood
My relationship with them is not good
It's da dilemma
Momma's broke and she need some change
Or should I go to school or stay in
I don't know
Help the physician within me
Heal myself
For the sake of my family don't let me kill myself
I know that it's something that we all gotta suffer
But why you had to take my grandmother
I'm trying to keep my head screwed
In a bad mood
If I sound rude
Dear God, excuse my attitude
I'm just searching for some answers
Will we ever find a cure for cancer?

Verse 3:

Can you please take time out to help ya boy
Cause they down hear trying to steal my joy
Was AIDS really a ploy, to destroy out of pope
That's what they saying
It's hard to phantom
Tell me they plan
Cause my friends in the hospital sick as can be
Fighting for his life against HIV
Now tell me how much longer can he last with his heart
Beating off life support
Can I please touch the hem of your garment?
Get on my knees and be cleanst of the torment
My heart is pure
But I think I'm at my limit
Cause every time I turn my back
I'm getting stabbed in it
Wait a minute before I end
Dear God will you tell me why I'm judged by the color of my skin
If you can please respond, a.s.a.p
Sincerely Willie D
