[Intro]
Tell your nigga jokes while he in the room
He gon' laugh harder than you cause he a coon
I'm a goon top down pants up when I walk
Never call a C.O. a boss I'm not a coon

[Verse 1]
Boom - it's the elephant in the room
Naw that's a mutha fucking coon
Blacks been free since Lincoln got wasted
But some of these niggas still on the plantation
Listen up Charles Barkley
You light skin but still calling you a darky
The only reason that they put the mic in your face
Is so you can do they dirt and talk down on your race
TNT made you big put you on a wig
Now you're acting like you never had trouble with pigs
You kissed a man in the mouth for reals dudes that's a no no
When you gon' come out the closet you fucking homo
Saw you on television dressing in drag
What kind of dumb nigga say slavery wasn't that bad
Dissing San Antonio women that's the kettle and pot
With that busted up looking ass wife you got

[Hook]
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Bootlicker shuck and jive you're a coon
You're a coon you're a coon you're a coon
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Sambo die slow you're a coon
You're a coon you're a coon you're a coon

[Verse 2]
How to make a coon - if you wish for a black one
Put some change in his pocket and give him a platform
Put him on suspension if he cross that line
But if he shitting on his people give him more airtime
Steven A Smith what's up with that hairline
Big mouth louder than 4 Alpines
Got a chip on your shoulder cause ball game suck
And you gotta work with players that your wife wanna fuck
I'm a savage running through the field amok
Raven-Symoné shut your chicken head dumb ass up
White folks don't love you black folks don't trust you
When you was on that show Bill Cosby must've drugged you
I had to get 'cause you're cooning for capital
You Hollywood niggas are laughable
You're not infallible like Cosby when they use you up
They gon' throw your ass under the bus

[Hook]
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Bootlicker shuck and jive you're a coon
You're a coon you're a coon you're a coon
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Sambo die slow, you're a coon
You're a coon, you're a coon, you're a coon

[Verse 3]
Aw hell CNN is on
Check out this lil bitch named Don Lemón
Getting stuck in the butt got your ass corrupted
You can smell weed but you can't smell injustice
Selling your people out while the police murder them
I wish the protestors would've shot you in Ferguson
I wish that would've been Stacy Dash on the ground instead of Michael Brown
But with additional rounds
Heard you slept your way to the top, somebody lying
You're D list actress, been divorced 3 times
Stank ass
They say you easy plus you on Fox News
How you gon' talk about somebody else morals and values
They prop these clowns up to undermine the plight
Give'm the spotlight and reduce'm to soundbites
Uncle Toms dancing to the stereotypes
How you mutha fuckers sleep at night

[Hook]
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Bootlicker shuck and jive you're a coon
You're a coon you're a coon you're a coon
If you're selling out your people you're a coon
If you hate your own kind you're a coon
Sambo die slow, you're a coon
You're a coon, you're a coon, you're a coon

[Monologue]
The supporters of coons love to talk about how they respect them because the coon have their own mind, or they have their own opinions, or they think outside of the box. That's a lie. The reason why they support the coon is because they can control the coon. Now, some people gonna have a problem with me callin' these coons out. First thing they gonna say is "crabsinthebucket, crabsinthebucket"… Let me tell you something: this ain't got nothin' to do with me trying to hold another black person back. I love to see black people gettin' it, you understand what I'm saying?

But if your criticism of the black community outweigh your contribution to the black community, and you black, you a mothafuckin' coon!

If every time the police shoot somebody black, and you take the police side, you are a coon!

If you fixed your mouth to say that we ended racism and discrimination in America, like this old coon-ass nigga, David Clarke, who call himself a Sheriff in Milwaukee, you are a coon!

If you are of any ethnicity other than white, and you support Donald Trump, yes, you are a coon!

If you out here rattin' on the next man 'cause he husslin', and y'all doin' the same thing, you're not just a coon, you a mothafuckin' rat-coon!

Now let me get back to this crossdressin'-ass nigga Charles Barkley— Look here, nigga, you love to talk about how you'll slap somebody. I wish you would put your mothafuckin' hands on me…I'd body your fat ass! Real talk. This nigga got a real self-hate issue. Fuck Charles Barkley, and the ground he walk on! If you fuckin' with Charles Barkley, fuck you too! Yeah, I said it…It's Willie D. H-town. Fifth Ward. Dirty dirty
