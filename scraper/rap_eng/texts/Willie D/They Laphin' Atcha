[Chorus]
(Male laughter)
You know ugly people love to make you laugh (2x)

[Verse 1]

Mr mr big man used to be the dopeman
Now you on the corner with a bucket tryna panhand
You dissed the niggas in the hood when you was rollin'
Tried to high-cap because your pockets were swollen (bitch)
Used to ride by and turn your nose up
Now me and every nigga in the hood done rose up
Now all the sudden you's a crumma
Niggas giving 20 for a blow from your baby momma
Sold your gold your car on bricks
And when you walk by niggas start locking they shit
Cuz your ass is in a slump you used to be Trump
Now you walk around beggin for a fuckin' buck
And it's a trip that the ones who had grip
Be the same niggas broker than Gilligan's ship
But i'm standing on top like a statue
Paid like a muthafucka
Laphin'Atcha

[Chorus] 3x

[Verse 2]

Miss thang she had a face like a model
And a body shaped like a fuckin' coke bottle
One look and niggas fell to their knees
She coulda had any muthafucka she please
And she did but then she got married
To a nigga with cash who took care of her ass
He bought her everything she ever wanted
I ain't jokin
The bitch had the nigga eyes wide open
Now he was a business man see
He used to travel outta town frequently
But one day he caught an early flight
Came back home and caught this nigga fuckin' his wife
He grabbed a shotgun and started shooting
The nigga jumped out the window the bitch start bootin'
But he caught her ass down the street
And drug her face in the concrete
Put a slug in her muthafuckin' liver
Now don't no nigga wanna fuck with her
And that'll make some of y'all nervous
But not me because the bitch deserved it

[Chorus] 3x

[Verse 3]

They laphin' atcha
For the crazy shit you do
Damn fool i'm laughing at you too
Because you never think for one minute
You just see some shit and jump right in it
Showin' off for them niggas you run with
Doin' dirt but they ain't never done shit
But cash in on a laugh or two
You thought they was laughing with you but the joke's on you
But that's just supposed to be your road dawgs
The niggas who put you up to carjack at the mall
But when you went to jail for auto theft
You served time by your muthafuckin' self
And as them laws took you in
One of your homeboys said (See ya wouldn't wanna be ya)
And you wonder why they never came to visit
They was too fuckin' busy
Laphin' atcha

[Chorus] 4x
