[Verse 1]
They said the song was forbidden it couldn’t be written
As you can see the the motherfuckers were bullshittin'
Many feared the Klan would hush 'em
But I snatched the pen and said "fuck 'em!"
Wrote the rhyme, put it in time
My mind, it ain’t blind to their kind
Motherfuck a goddamned KKK
Morton Downey Jr. get your prejudiced ass away
From my TV set
Zip it, son of a bitch; I ain’t through yet
Before I’m on my way today
I’ve got something to say to the KKK:
Fuck you, bitch!

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK

[Verse 2]
Television—a bigger killer than cancer
Do you watch it? Wrong answer!
It’s teaching our kids how to steal and kill
Don’t ask me how I feel
Cuz I might just form a congregation to start wastin'
They’re fucking us up through education
Poor neighborhoods are getting short sticked
'Cause everyone else gets help from the government
The board of education are bunch of
Prejudiced sons of bitches, I’m snitching
Cause all you hoes gotta go
T.A.K.S., that’s a test for the white folks
They ain’t teaching our kids the same shit
Hypocrite, bullshit teachers ain’t new to this
So it’s up to us to get involved
Cause to them it’s just a motherfucking job
I see fresh text books at white schools
We getting shit they done already used
The board is the motherfucking enemy
So we can’t compete academically
With students our own age
All of this shit goes back to the slave days
When the white man kept us illiterate
Hid the books, so we wouldn’t know shit
We’ve got to fight for justice
Cause those motherfuckers ain’t giving a shit
Before I’m on my way today
I’ve got something to say to the KKK:
Fuck you, bitch!

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK

[Verse 3]
40 acres and a mule, peace to Charles Sumner
David Duke: I got your number
Talking that shit in the Cajun state
Come to Texas and I'm-a wait
For you to start talking that trash, yeah
So me and my boys can put somethin' on your ass
How can you say that you’re a Christian motherfucker
When you don’t even love your own brother?
Family, boy, whether you like it or not
When will this bullshit stop?
Hatin' another man for his skin complexion
But I’m focused in another direction
Straight out to ghetto and into rap
They saw blacks getting over and tried to hold us back
Fucking with me, what for?
Cause I ain’t slamming a guitar?
Fuck you, bitch!

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK

[Sample from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. speech]

[Verse 4 - Willie D]
King, the man is long gone
But I’m aware that it wasn’t that long ago
That he was killed in cold blood by a bigot
Hoover dirty ass knew before he did it
The hangings, the whippings, damn a five-oh
We ain’t taking none of that shit no mo'
Call me a nigga if you wanna
And I’mma run circles around your ass like at Daytona
The white man got us believing
That everything white is right and black is evil
The only bad thing black is the black eye you gonna get
Fronting me with that bullshit
Skinheads ain’t new to this land
It’s just another name for the Ku-Klux Klan
Every racist in America can suck my dick
And while you doing it, listen to this:
Fuck you, bitch!

[Chorus]
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
(Yeah) Motherfuck the KKK
