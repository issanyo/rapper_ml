Intro [Willie D]
These dudes today
When they see you wit a live car, live girl..
They ain’t motivated to get the own
They want yo car
Yo girl
That’s why I basically don’t trust nobody
I feel like the more I find myself the more people I lose

Hook [JD POM]
Trust nobody trust nobody keep yo distance
I keep bands right beside me for assistance
When I was down where you, yeah you was missing
I trust nobody trust nobody
Keep yo distance

Verse [Willie D]
It’s Willie D bitch fuck yo momma
In the benz with the Panorama
I got restaurants, Duplexes, land in Texas
And other investments
So what’s with the message I hear the rubber where was everybody when yah boy was broke
Sleeping on floors, eating Big Macs and drinking molt.. yeah that’s what I thought
So fuck y’all, all of y’all
Hope you die in a crash with ya roachin ass
When the feds came to the airport put the cuffs on so called friends wouldn’t answer the phone
All I wanted was a check
All I wanted was respect
All I wanted was a Lex
No I’m not going in raw i bring my own rubbers and freshin right after we sex

Hook 2x [JD POM]
Trust nobody trust nobody keep yo distance
I keep bands right beside me for assistance
When I was down where you, yeah you was missing
I trust nobody trust nobody
Keep yo distance

Verse [JD POM]
Attention it’s me here again
Yo greatest nightmare with pen
Standing right under yo chin
Time is money, money time
And they failing to realize it’s more than pretend
I come from a city that’s never gone change
From the hood where they and love to go bang
And they selling outside, right outside window frames
And they hate on each other and gossip on names
Never ever ever ever will I waste a minute
You know much better than that
Diamonds dance on my neck and my wrist
And these hates just watching just show some respect
All I wanted was a band
All I wanted was a fan
All I wanted was a hand
No I’m not trusting nobody who wasn’t apart of the plan

Hook 2x[JD POM]
Trust nobody trust nobody keep yo distance
I keep bands right beside me for assistance
When I was down where you, yeah you was missing
I trust nobody trust nobody
Keep yo distance
