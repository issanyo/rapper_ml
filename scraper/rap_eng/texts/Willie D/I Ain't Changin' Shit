[Hook x4]
Never gonna bite my tongue (yo nigga)
Man fuck them hoes, I ain't changin' shit

[Verse 1: Willie D]
Goddamn it I warned ya, stupid muthafuckas
Who is this bitch named C. Delores Tucker
Letting that lip flop, fucking with hip hop
She'd get her old ass dropped
To the floor it's the way shit'll G-O
Cause that ho ain't no better than massimo
And even Dionne Warwick on the bandwag
Trynna ban rap with her big nose, ugly ass
Bitch claim to be a psychic, but she can't see
What pay the bills is reality
Cause niggas is tired of the (???)
Making them laugh, and kissing white folks ass
That's why they love Sammy
Look like that's the only way a nigga gonna get Grammy
And because of this, some of yall gone switch, but me
I ain't changin' shit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lez Mone]
I ain't gots to change shit
Now nigga get a load of this
Lez Mone, flexing on the fat tracks, bitch
Switch?
No, I got to let the rhymes flow, large
Mariah can't carry me, ho
Oh no, here I go once more
Fuck the niggas and the high class hoes
My style is mine, my style is fine
And if you don't like it
Willie D got the muthafuckin' nine
[What's that for?]
To spit ya muthafuckin' dime
Packing half, if you don't like my fucking sag
[Imma bust some caps in yo heffa ass]
So bitches get a grip
And niggas jump ship
And if you don't like it you can leave with a fat lip
Yeah, Lez Mone talking shit on this muthafuckin' track
And I ain't changin' shit for none of you muthafuckas

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Willie D]
'88 was the year I came into this rap game
And ain't shit changed
Everywhere I look I see a humdrum
Muthafucks been biting since Roxanne won
Now everybody wannabe a gangsta
Even R&B niggas got that gear
And all that hizza, fizza, wizza bullshit
Get off Snoop Dogg's dick
And push up on ya own
Come original Crip
Before you fuck around with a (???)
All on another niggas pecker
That's why yo ass ain't selling no records
And my career in this business is continuing
Cause muthafuckas want what's geniune
And that's real, not your goddamn run of the mill
Yeah, muthafuckas I'mma be here
Making that money like I'm suppose
And talking about these bald headed hoes
So keep cracking them jokes about a muthafuckin hollerin' bitch
I ain't changin' shit
