[Intro: Willie D]
Okay
We going to do this for all our people
Checked out kind of early
Left [?] by ourselves, mourn
This for y'all

[Verse One: Willie D]
She was the finest little cutie on the block
Neighborhood jewel, making appearances in others [?]
Straight A student, prettiest girl in Houston
Look at what the ghetto is capable of producin'
I like the way she carried her self and all
Took my calls everyday but never gave me the play
Her boyfriend played ball at the high school
I used to dream about them quitting I can't lie fool because she was cool
Unlike Miss Goodie Two Shoes she was polite
Never had a fight always polite
Most sought after honey on the cut
And never once wore her clothes up her butt, motherfucker what
She graduated, got pregnant it was crazy
Doctor's told her she could die if she didn't abort the baby
She had a chance and she took it
The baby lived but she died, look it look it
I'm thinking about all the ones out there bad having babies for the welfare
But then life ain't fair
I wish she could have shared her secret with every other woman
Damn that'd would have been somethin', but she gone too soon

[Hook:]
Family and friends of the ones that's gone
Hold on be strong, we ain't in this alone
Let not our heart be troubled take your burdens to the lord
He'll fight your battles, when times get hard

[Verse Two: Willie D]
What's up Kee? I see you dog
We used to sing in the [?] and shoot basketball
Nigga you was tall, damn you could shoot that ball
Me, a played [?] so I always fouled
We had a crew that was rough from the smallest on up
And when we had a little change we walked the [?] on us
We took the problems in the hood into our own hands
Fifteen in the park, whooping grown men
But I remember one time that we fought each other
And I, fuck it lets call it a tie
'Cause the girl was fighting over turned out to be freaky
In that regard we both winners although you deceased
Your momma told me to stop [?}
I lied and said I tried because her eyes reflect your coffin
Man I don't want to see that, hope I'm forgiven
Crosses and candle lights and yellow ribbons, you're gone too soon

[Hook:]
Family and friends of the ones that's gone
Hold on be strong, we ain't in this alone
Let not our heart be troubled take your burdens to the lord
He'll fight your battles, when times get hard
[When the Chorus gets repeated the last four words are changed to "Promised to God"]

[Verse Three: Willie D]
Momma where have you gone, I'm still trying to a [?]
Losing you made me strong, help me complete this song
I'm so alone, dealing with the loss
You're still trying to come to grips the way you kicked me out your house
Made me sit on the porch, in the cold
I admit I was bad, but goddamn I was only five years old
That's too cold, made me made as shit
One of the reason I became a child advocate
But you know what they say, ain't nobody like Momma
Since you, passed away ain't nobody like Momma
Your breast cancer got worse with the Kimo
If you would have only taken a mammogram, who knows?
And Pops even though we didn't have as much time spent
I still felt it when you went
I never got to bond with y'all, have fun with y'all
Maybe somebody I'll become one with y'all, gone too soon

[Hook:]
Family and friends of the ones that's gone
Hold on be strong, we ain't in this alone
Let not our heart be troubled take your burdens to the lord
He'll fight your battles, when times get hard
[When the Chorus gets repeated the last four words are changed to "Promised to God"]

[Outro:]
For my folks, gone but not forgotten
Young lady I spoke of in the first verse [?]
Joe, one of God's most beautiful creations
(Laughs) Killed the rest, before you was a mess
Cousin Lary, [?} can't beat them
[?] All my soldiers in the rap game, my extended family
Eazy-E, Buff Love, Pac, Big L, [?], Biggie, Pun
(Whoo!) DJ Screw, Mafioso, Fat Pat, Beautiful Left Eye
What a crazy one
And lived to it, when you put it down you did your R&B thang
You put it down for Hip Hop
Never ride out on my boys, one of the most talented dudes to ever pick up a microphone
Big Mello, what it do?
It's a done deal baby, yeah!
