(talking)
Haha, Y'all thought this was Dragnet, didn't you?
Wrong answer again
This song is for all the mothafuckin' chicken-head bitches
And we kept the mothafuckin' names the same
'Cause we think being a bald-head bitch is a goddamn shame

[Verse 1]
What the fuck is goin' on in this goddamn world?
What are you, bitch? A boy or a girl?
I can't tell 'cause your shit on the sides are gone
You remind me of that monkey-lookin' bitch Grace Jones
Fucked up is how you look to Willie D
I just gotta have a bitch that has more hair than me
Some try to cover up by weavin' it through
You ain't foolin' nobody
We know you're bald-headed, too

Chorus:
Bald-head hoes
Whatcha see D, w-w-w-whatcha see D
I see some bald-head hoes
Bald-head hoes
Whatcha see D, w-w-w-whatcha see D
I see some bald-head hoes

[Verse 2]
There should be a crime against bald-head hoes
Why they want to be bald?
Nobody knows!
Being bald makes a gal look like a beast
Stupid-ass hoes, ain't ya heard of grease?
Hell naw
Cause if you did, you'd have some up there
Like your pussy, you gotta give it proper care
Every time I look around, I see a damn disgrace
Motherfucking wig pieces all over the place!
It's from them (bald-head hoes)
They just so damn mean
The meanest-ass hoes I ever seen
Ain't got no hair, so they act crude
And wanna go and pick a fight with the girls who do
Am I right? (You right.)
Hell yeah I'm right!
I've seen this shit, night after night
Instead of wearin' other people's hair, you dumbass bitch
You need to buy some dog mane, and grow your own damn shit!

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Now I just can't go with a bald-head hoe
You ain't gotta ask why for me to tell you so
If I can't run through her hair with my hand
Somehow it seems like I be fuckin' a man!
So stay away you bald hickies
I know you out there
Talkin to you hoes who ain't got no hair
Your sister bald, Zanny
Your mamma bald, Eddie
I bet you even got a bald-headed-ass granny

Chorus

(talking)
Now this is how you spot a bald-head hoe

[Verse 4]
Hair spots on a hot sunny day
Too many gaps in the scalp is a dead giveaway
I saw no-hair Clair
Yesterday on the cut
Today I saw the girl, her hair was down to her butt
I hope that she know, that I know it ain't real
But I won't squeal not even on Andrea
Kim, Shawn or Merylinn
Nor Tamika and Rikaâ€”the famous bald-head twins
Something must be done
About these citizens
You ask what will I do to support my fellow man?
I'm proposin' a bill
To Capitol Hill
To kill all bald-headed women at will
