[Intro:]
[WILLIE D:] Boy, what you doing there three o'clock in the morning?
[BOY:] Uncle Willie, I gotta leave Houston. I'm five years old and I'm stuck in the dope game

[Hook:]
I don't play the part ???
[BOY:] In the dirt game, in the dirt game

[Verse 1: Willie D]
Niggas are dyin', family's are cryin' I'm wondering why and
The hell blacks keep looking to the sky and
Asking God for help
When he only help those who help themselves
And niggers don't fit the category
Cause when it's black on black we pull the trigger in a hurry
Please don't step on my Roll Dogs High Tops
Cause he'll put your ass in a pine box
And if he makes it to court
Don't be surprised if your family comes up short
See you're dealing with a system that do not care
About niggers and others on welfare
Every single day
Another brother in my city gets blown away
Check out the ten o'clock news tonight, I'm not lying
Man, niggers are dying

[Verse 2: Willie D]
Rodney got killed on the streets the other week
He was my friend and so was Keith
Each one had a chance
But they died waiting on the ambulance
No I won't blame the paramedics
Like Cube I'mma blame it on us cause we let it
Happen, again and again without doing shit
But when the police do it we want to pich a bitch
Niggers dropping like flys
And Willie D's running out of suits and ties
Going to funerals G
Staring at the casket knowing one day it'll be me
I fight the tears from the webs of my eyes
With the family I gotta sympathise
See it's hard on more but the ? is much harder
Cause blood is thicker than water
It's messed up how they shot little dude
He was just a baby, only in middle school
The Lord giveth then he take it away
Now that's fine, but why are we the only ones dyin'

[Verse 3: Willie D]
I don't go to the club as much
Cause niggers do nothing but cuss and fuss
And bust caps on one another
Every night around 2 am fools running for cover
And since bullets ain't got no name
Somebody ends up slang cause niggers can't aim
One shot to the head duke homie try to duck
But the slug beat him to his move
Another brother got laid to rest
Came in a Jeep but left in a Hearse
Now that's the way the ball bounces
Can't keep blaming the shit on the forty ounces
Cause it goes to the white clubs boo
See 'em drink all night and never argue
But I can't go to the park
Cause any time a bunch of niggers together some shits gon' start
Acting just like monkeys
Getting laughed at by the red neck honkeys
And you know I'm not lying
God damn it, niggers are dying

[Interlude:]
[BOY:] I don't know Uncle Willie, my mamma's in the streets every day and my daddy on that shit
I don't know what I'mma do, what you think?
[WILLIE D:] I'll tell you what you crash here tonight, tomorrow we go shopping and you roll with me and um
