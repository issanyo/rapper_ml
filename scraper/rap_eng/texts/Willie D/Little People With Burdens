[Intro:]
Mic check
Mic check, one, two, one, two
Yeah, aight, let's do it

[Verse 1: Willie D]
Heaven lift her spirits 'cause he robbed her of her childhood
Forced himself on her body and he smiled good
She wanted to tell but she felt so ashamed
When her teacher asked what was wrong she couldn't explain
It happened again, each time he was a little drunker
What made it so bad, it was her uncle
Don't be surprised 'cause when a child gets molested, yo
Often it's by somebody they know
She finally got the courage to tell her  mom
And her mom went off, started fussing like it was all her fault
Told to respect our elders but when our elders act filthy
And you protect them, you JUST as guilty!
She's not guilty, the girl needs love and compassion
[?] Since he took her body but he'll never take her innocence
And all the parents with boys take a breather
They ain't safe either

[Hook: Tony Henry]
It's sad to say but our children are being abused
Give them love and protection is all we've got to do
You're not alone 'cause deep inside my heart is also hurting
I feel your [?], little  people with burdens

[Verse 2: Willie D]
She took an infant child's life and she did about three
And the judge let her go scot free, couldn't of been me
Cause I'd of left [?] [?] hell freezed over
And that's cold but it gets colder
Little man, ain't got nothing to eat
Barely got shoes on his feet, his dad's a deadbeat
He wants to be an athlete but he can't
'Cause Pops spent the money for the physical exam [?]
Nobody to love who would love her back
So, at 14 she got pregnant and shacked
Up with a dude who twice her age
It ain't enough time in the day, she used to make straight A's
The suicide rate is at an all time high
Shorty ain't started to feel yet, he want to die
He gets bullied at school, at home he takes a bruising
Can't win for losing, little people with  burdens

[Hook: Tony Henry]
It's sad to say but our children are being abused
Give them love and protection is all we've got to do
You're not alone 'cause deep inside my heart is also hurting
I feel your [?], little  people with burdens

[Verse 3: Willie D]
Little people with burdens, I know it's hard
I know it's hard but take your burdens  to the Lord
And when life throws you curve balls don't strike out
I've been in your shoes, I know exactly what I'm talking about
So there's the dude with the crack rock on the corner
I talk to my man, he don't really wanna
Slang, but he feels he has no recourse
But the paper chase and make his neighborhood unsafe
Never hustle when you lay your head in further [?]
Don't let the streets seduce you, don't you know you the future?
The girl next door never got any hugs
And her parents wonder why she do drugs
Hang out with thugs, and do things she can't mention
And always in juvenile detention
They bought her everything that money couldn't mention
But all she wanted was attention, little people with burdens

[Hook: Tony Henry]
It's sad to say but our children are being abused
Give them love and protection is all we've got to do
You're not alone 'cause deep inside my heart is also hurting
I feel your [?], little  people with burdens

[Outro: Willie D]
So what you gonna do?
We in the state of emergency but you got people out there that like they can't hear the Lord
If this was about money
We'd probably be the midst of a war by now
So if you're in a situation where you feel where you can't get out
Trust me,  there's always a way  out
Ain't nobody got the right to abuse you
Not your momma, not your daddy, not friends of the family, nobody!
It's a sad existence when every time you pick up the newspaper
Or watch television, you see
Some kid getting abducted, or abused or killed
Today's abused kid is tomorrow's abusive adult
Think about that
