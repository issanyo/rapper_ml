[Verse One: Sho]
My boy lived the fast life, jacking and slanging crack
At thirteen he went to jail for assault with a bat
A young brother, trying to come up on the cuts
He never had a dime so he never gave a
His mom's broke her back working at the store
His Dad grew weed and sold his cess out the back door
So where the hell's his hero?
You see his soul was cold all he knew was gold chains and elbows
He [?] dope, he couldn't get it
He wasn't wit it, the Dope man's head he had to split it
He came up quick, he stoled six
He got him a crew and put his boys in the dope mix
Now he's running he's hood like he said he would
It's understood that, my boys living real good
His face [?] he had a peach fuzz
And everywhere he went people knew who the hell he was
I guess it kind of went to his [?]
Thought he was Tony Montana, he started having people killed
And in the game it was the same thang
Started shortening his customers, my boy had straight change
Never took the time to look around
Ganking his homeboys soldiers who were then [?]
I guess the kid just never found
What goes up, must also come down
And think about tomorrow, he never bothered
He always said he wasn't promised to live any farther
He could be here today
And gone tomorrow

[Verse Two: Sho]
Now back to the [?} of the snow
The 'caine got low, he wasn't making the same dough
He'll always be paid that's what he used to say
Never put a dollar away for a rainy day
But now it's raining cats and dogs
He need to pull a job but he got heat from the law
Thinking about the days he stoled six
And came up quick, perhaps another jack trick
So he started working the town
Until he found when a big lick was going down
He got a scoot, it's time to get the loot
He told the boys he'd dress the humps in funeral suits
They made no mistake got what they to take it
And everybody hears bodies being [?] out awake
He's back on his feet it's been about two weeks
A new car and mouth full of gold teeth
Flashing his cash
You see flashing his cash would be the end of his stupid ass
Flashing to the homies or the boys he jacked
Yeah he my dog but I thought he was smarter than that
They waited at his crib for him to come home
Stepped out his ride, they put a slug in my boys dome
Now his gal's gotta raise his little girl
The unborn child, she's about to bring in this world
And what she's going to tell her daughter
When she ask's "Momma, what happened to my father?"
Standing at his grave sight with their hearts full of sorrow
Here today and gone tomorrow

[Outro: Sho]
What is it?
For your woman, your mother, your kids, your brothers, your sisters
See you laying in the streets dead
On TV, or read about it in the paper
It ain't worth it brother, it ain't worth it
