"Who gives a fuck about a God damn grammy?"

[Verse 1: Willie D]
Yo, Flav, I give a fuck about a God damn grammy
But them motherfuckin hoes won't hand me one
At least you was invited by the biggots
The motherfuckers told me to buy a ticket
To the phoney ass ceremony
Fuck Oscar, Emmy and Tony
Cause when it comes to award time
Niggas be standin on the God damn sideline
I'm loadin my nine 'cause I got a lotta grudges
I'm bout to take out the judges
Willie D won't shit cha but hit cha
Take a look at the overall picture
Every year its the same old story
Same faces, same categories
I sold a lotta records and a lotta people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy?

[Verse 2: Willie D]
I'm under a microscope, for the songs I wrote
Cause the ganksta of love don't scapegoat
I tell it like it is that's why they don't have me
I ain't tryin to make nobody happy
I'm from the streets so I kick it for the ghetto
I can't talk about shit I don't know
Your whole vocabulary's, "Baby baby baby"
That's why you so God damn crazy
And it should be a crime
One sucka gets nominated 5 or 6 damn times
It ain't that he's better than the rest
It's just a damn popularity contest
Or a bribe or a favor
Motherfuckers make a speech and they think that they major
I sold a lot of records and a lot of people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy?

(Award host)
"And the winner is George Strait"
"For best female vocalist, Reba McIntyre"
"Most appearances made after death, Elvis Presley
The king couldn't be here due to illness
So to accept his award on his behalf, we have Grateful Dead"

[Verse 3: Willie D]
It ain't what you know, it's who you know bro
That's why I'm not on your radio and your video show
It's gettin kinda hectic
And I still ain't kissin no ass to be accepted
They finally gotta category for rap
But don't blink 'cause you'll miss it in the format
And if you follow my suggestions
9 times outta 10 you see some country western
They need to have Willie D on that stage
Pumpin his fists like this and gettin bliss
With MD-20 20
Or the 40 O-Z wit the rest of the GB
I'm tired of your boring shows
I make your stuck up ass audience say HO!
I sold a lotta records and a lotta people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy

(Award host)
"And the winner is Randy Travis
And Guns and...hey what the?"
(Willie D)
"GET the fuck outta the way
Get your ass out the God damn way
Yo man, the real motherfuckin winners is
The God damn Geto Boys for most fuck words in a song
The Bitch Killa of the Year grammy goes to
That nigga you love to have Ice Cube
The nasty ass group award goes out to 2 Live Crew
The High Roller of the industry award goes out to Ice T
The pro-black grammy goes out to Public Enemy
Cause they too black and they too God damn strong
And we gonna give the lip-sync God damn motherfuckin grammy
To those punk motherfuckers, Milli Vanilli"
