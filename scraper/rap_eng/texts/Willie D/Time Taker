Scarface:
As I open my eyes unto a new day
I see the same old shit that I was face to face with yesterday
It's all the same and I can't change time
An example of a young nigga trapped up and his brain's dyin'
I close my eyes to refrain my thoughts (open)
Open my eyes to remain untaught
Why my life gotta have a yesterday?
Why can't I memorize tommorrow and live my life as just a day?
A baby's born and you hears moms cryin'
Is she cryin' cause that she's happy or the fact that she know she gone
Dyin'
Probably some shit we'll never figure out
I think my mind is plotting plangs and my second mind is trying to take me
Out
I had a dream I think I saw a dude cause he had the looks that of a killer
And he sung to me these four tunes
He said "Life is like a game of dice
You roll 'em right the first time but you seldom get to roll 'em twice"
Not understanding what he said doc
I find myself in the middle of life in an infa-red dot
So tell me doctor is you gettin' that?
Motherfuckers bustin' at you with wheels now can you picture that?
That's why you find me an assult mind
Cause in this world we live together but divided by a chalk line
You wanted to hear my life story well I told you
Maybe there's answers to my question in your minila folder
What's the solution to this mind state?
You tellin' me it's gonna take you some time. How long do time take?
I'm losing focus on this straight line
Ain't trying to wait for motherfuckers so now I'm forced to take time

Willie D:
I pull my popper out my trousers aimed it at his abdomen
And grabbed the man's life away from him in a moment
Angel dust and heroin and all that I was on it
My opponent never knew what hit him
As I was bootin' I heard him say "Get down somebody's shootin'"
He didn't realize he was the target
I didn't realize what I was doing till he departed
Oh Lord, I'm feeling something I never felt black
I told his momma I was sorry she said "Sorry won't bring him back"
God gave life to the human race and he alone has the right to take it away
So I tell me that I don't care
But every time I dim the lights I'm havin' motherfuckin' nightmares
It's been a year since I heard dude holler
And I can still smell the motherfuckin' gunpowder
What does life mean to me?
I'd trade places with the man a heartbeat if I was granted peace
I try to wipe it out my memory
I saw a shrink but she couldn't provide a remedy
I'm public enemy number one
Waitin' in line on death row to get the needle for what I done
Pretty soon I meet my maker
Thee creator, the one and only true time taker

Bushwick Bill:
How much more longer I got life left
You don't know that's why I live day for day and time it right and left
And try to take two steps at a time
Makin' sure our opposition stays two steps behind
Keep in mind these niggas who wanna see me lettin' go and shit
That's why I fight for my life until it's over with
I know these niggas havin' hard times
That's why I'm standing up and fighting for shit when it reguards mines
Why must I always sing these sad songs
Because they comforance all my feelings inside till all the bad's gone
You wanna hear my life story well I told ya
Maybe there's answers to my question in you fuckin' folder
What's the solution to this mind state?
You tellin' me it's gonna take some time. How long do time take?
I'm losin' focus on my straight linne
Ain't trying to wait for a motherfuckers so now I'm forced to take time
