Yeah, yeah
I’m loosin' it
What up Trax?
My veins open up now, chuch
Let’s get it

[Verse 1]
They ain't rip it, they just plain can't get it
Not the way I spit it cause I'm different
Magnificent when I kick it, huuh
Flow too vicious, eat rappers like they delicious
Killin' everything which is fictitious, for the riches
Now can I get a witness, haa?
Look at what a nigga did
Fuckin' with a lyrical contortion is hard
Forcin' the scars, scorchin' a mark, make it so sick
I leave 'em prayin' to the porcelain god
Comin' with a [?] of lyrics, anybody wanna differ
Tell it to me when you're lookin' at the grill
Lot of luck, G for the great Bonneville
Pickin' up a bitch and take a [?deep amount of pill?]
Like I'm off a pill
Radioactive when I ride it, when I do it
And let 'em know they can't fuck with him
On the block like Jordan, take a shot like Duke
So bring the Dutches in
About bitch niggas I could give two fucks
Like the Ku Klux was in
You could murder what I write?
I was just spazzin', who said I touched a pen?
When I do, I bet you see it on Billboard
What the fuck you think I'm blowin' on kill for
We gon' see which one of us a nigga feel more
Relax sometimes but doesn't get real bored
Disappear for a minute, when I come back, I'mma kill 'em
I'm a rap ??
But never get it twisted, I'm a livin' of a villain
When I clap, I spray

[Chorus 2x]
I ain't wired right
I ain't wired right
I'm 'bout to set this bitch on fire
I ain't wired right!
I ain't wired right, nah
I ain't wired right
Cause a blackout in this bitch
Now can I get a witness, haa?

[Verse 2]
Better be scared of my legacy, homie
You won't diminish mine
Finna curl swing with a verse, like a nigga first
To cross the finish line
Who would'a ever thought a nigga in the game
20 years and still be in his prime
I eat up that new
Motherfucker you finna sign
Fiercely in it, Chi-Town
But you think I put a little bit of Philly in it
If I said it, then I really meant it
Tear a nigga up like an Achilles tendon
Better yet an ACL, they see hell, when I hit the dank
Get 'em in the paint, stick 'em with a shank
Celebrate and roll another round of kush
Hit it till I'm feelin' like a nigga finna faint
You don't like what I said, screw you
You don't know what I said, "SCREW ME"
Texas style, I can wreck this style
Like I was a Mossberg or an Uzi
Nigga, for you to be called, I'mma see
If you can spit cause I can serve a hater on a platter
With the security code of a G
So you can never tap into the data or the data
The ultimatum is I gotta be strong in a whole city full of fiends
That's why my niggas stay holdin' metal like Wolverine
The cause-a-riot type
But me, I'm the quiet type
They be the ones that you really gotta watch out for
Cause they ain't wired right!

[Chorus 2x]
I ain't wired right
I ain't wired right
I'm 'bout to set this bitch on fire
I ain't wired right!
I ain't wired right, nah
I ain't wired right
Cause a blackout in this bitch
Now can I get a witness, haa?
