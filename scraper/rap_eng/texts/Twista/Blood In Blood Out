Me and my closest roll dog
Came up in an early age on the corner servin cane
Gang bangin and everythang
We some mutherfuckin gangstas
Broke to the right
Blood in Blood out brothers and we swore that was for life
Servin them keys and be clocking them g's and
We got whatever you need just a come and see me
Or my mutherfucking nug bout to show this city up show love
Or catch that bug from that nine millimeter slug
I broke bread with this nigga, i bust lead with this nigga
Heard he fucking with the feds
Can't believe it, not my nigga
Selling me for the cash, was he moving too fast
Talking behing my back to them damn hood rats
I'm going crazy ain't that a bitch
You try and get bitched and your closest rodey
Turns into a snitch
Just smiling and laughing in your fucking face
Went behind your fucking back hooking you with a fucking case
Going insane and i don't know what to think
Paranoid out my mind as i take another drink
Of that hennessy motherfuckin cognac
Got me reaching for my nine
Bout to peel this niggas cap
So i waked out the house
And i headed for the corner
I seen that nigga creeped up on him
Bitch yous a goner
Up that itchy to his temple why'd you try to fuck me Rodey
Starting crying seeing me
Nigga, this ain't to New Jack City
And my name ain't no mutherfuckin Nino Brown
A tear roll down my cheek and i blew his brains on the ground
Sirens all around lights all in my face
Dick boys on the case so i headed towards the gate
Bitch freeze
Bitch please
Thats what i told them punk ass cops
All of a sudden i heard the shot
Couldn't believe i just got popped
Didn't drop, turned around, grapped my nine, then i pulled it
Started yelling just like fates “Bitch i took your fucking bullet”
Everything turned cold and got dark
I couldn't feel nathan but the beating of my heart

Blood in blood out
I thought that we was family
Can't believe he crossed me
Got to break him off G
Am i my brothers keeper
I thought that was for life
Its gonna be a murder this nigga gots ta die
