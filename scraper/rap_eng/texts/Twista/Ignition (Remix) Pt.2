[Intro: R. Kelly]
Now, usually I dont do this, but uhhh...
Give 'em a lil' preview of the remix

Now I'm not tryin to be rude
But hey, pretty girl, I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do
Remind me of my Lexus coup
Thats why I'm all up in yo grill
Tryna get you to a hotel
You must be a foot-ball coach
The way you got me playin the field

[Hook]
So baby gimme that toot toot
And let me give you that beep beep
Runnin her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin on 24's
While they sayin on the radio...

[Hook]
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin
That body
Got every man in here wishin
Sippin on coke and rum
I'm like so what I'm drunk
Its the freakin weekend baby
I'm about to have me some fun

[2nd hook]
(Let me see you)
Bounce-bounce-bounce - repeat 3x
(Now let me see you)
Bounce-bounce-bounce

(come on)
Now its like murder she wrote
Once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
Still they can hear you screamin' mo'
Girl I'm feelin' what you feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the, thee ignition

[Hook]

[Hook]

Cristal poppin' in a stretch navigator
We got food everywhere
As if the party was catered
We got fellas to my left, honies on my right
We bring 'em both together, we got jukin' all night
Then after the show its the [after party]
And after the party is the [hotel lobby]
Around about for you gotta [clear the lobby]
Then take it to your room and +freak+ somebody

[Hook]

[2nd hook]

[Twista]
Now let me get you hot as the paint on a Por-sche
Let me come and ride you, I heard you a runn-er
Baby got them curves just like a Cor-vette
Wit that big ol' booty like you was a Hummer
First you wanna take it up wit a baller
Thinkin while you rollin up on the Twista
Getting you from the back and ride you like a Cadillac
And got you cruisin while I'm bangin your sound system

[Hook w/ Twista]
Now let me get a {toot toot}
And let me hit you wit a {beep beep}
Runnin her hands on my fade
Bouncin on the 24's wit the spinnin blades
Wit the ladies goin {toot toot}
And the fellas goin {beep beep}
And we got the windows up tokin big 'dro
While we rollin on the Jordans on them 24's
While we roll for G-C-I straight up lyric twistin'

[Hook]

Girl we off in this jeep
Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Stroke it round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out...
