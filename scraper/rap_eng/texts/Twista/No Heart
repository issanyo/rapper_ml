[Verse 1: Twista]
Now when it comes to blowin' dro you know I got's the bomb
Quick to dump these bullets up in your ass like Lebron
Got me bustin' at these haters, I'm a motherfucking killa
Just call me the West Side Mobster, I'm your real ass nigga
Motherfuckas try to play me cause they know I get my cash on
Do a 187 with this motherfuckin' mask on
Jumpin' up outta the truck
Deep as the bass on this bomb beat
Tore his dome apart, left his brains on the concrete
Now I gets more paper then the rest of these ballas
Runnin' to the tat by the tat [?]
With the street sweeper from the corner
Never catch me slippin', cause I'm known to keep a trey pound
Lay down, blast on that ass cause I'm from K-town, nigga
They hated since the very start, so I shitted on the game

[Bridge: Twista]
That's why Twista gots... no heart
(Ain't no love bitch)
Twista gots... no heart
(Ain't no love bitch)
That's why Twista got's no heart

[Hook: Twista] x2
Finna shoot a nigga up (x2) if he do not wanna get me my payuh (Ain't no love bitch)
Kill a nigga for the dust (x2) cause that's the chi town way-uh (Ain't no love bitch)

[Verse 2: Game]
It's me and T-T-Twista rollin' 6-4 Impala on gold
Its top back, Glock on my lap, LAPD-patrollin'
Ghetto bird over my shoulders, I'm a boss
And I catch bullets in the field like Randy Moss (moss)
I'm the face of L.A, got L.A on my face
Hydraulics in the trunk, and the cake by the safe
I don't bathe in apes, I got gorillas in jail
I wear hoodies for real, you wear hoodies like Pharrell
Pharrell got pastell colors on him
I got a TV in the Range showing colors on it
Sellin' candy rain, it's for lovers only
Push coke till I die, put my dead brother on it
As I ride with my gun in my vest
Niggas in the Chi call me Kanye West
Cause when I'm fresh outta Hennessy I'm buying the bar
Toast for my nigga Shyne in the pen
(This is the tracks ...No Heart)

[Hook: Twista] x2
Finna shoot a nigga up (x2)
If he do not wanna get me my payuh (Ain't no love bitch)
Kill a nigga for the dust (x2)
Cause that's the chi town way-uh (Ain't no love bitch)
