Check out ma' straps
I'm finna' flex holdin' em'
Picture how I buss at these niggas' like cineplex odeon
I'm finna' step over em'
Come see how I'm bussin'
Catchin' slugs in your heart and lungs is a deadly reprucussion
I got big guns and ma' bullets is the athiest
Even though you hate me
It's hard too believe like a athiest
Never too offend any Christian if you listenin'
But I be Christ-like and bright-white gods
Ma life is intrestin'
6 points of a men than under the body decrescent
Intelligent intellect like the internet
I'm omnipresent
Then when the spirit leaves the flesh that God be testin'
Wrapped in a lyna coffin
The pyramid's where I be restin'
Syllables catastrophic too the mindstate of a sucka'
Complex too a scientific heathen
Complicate yo' mental structure
Circuitry too ma' lyricism
I spit cyber-gothic
Hotwires in the cockpit
Everything made with fiber-optic
Fire in the rocket taken me up too the stars
Galactic bars got me sportin' fly cars on Mars
Intricate patterns enablin' me too get money when I be on Saturn
Ain't nobody up in the galaxy willin' too challenge me when I be rappin'
Twista so cold
Flow so ridiculous
He's so articulous
They got the vapors and none of it he had to write on the paper where he was just spittin' and kickin' it
6 bars at a time
You thinkin' it's something you like now
Imagine if it was some shit that I chose too write down
