[Chorus: x2]
I ain't that nigga
I jus' thought I'd let chu kno
When I'm rollin with a black Fo' Fo'
I ain't that nigga

Nah I ain't a gangsta, but kick it with board members and governors that love larry hoover
Niggas that'll do ya, Crackin a rifile over deciple have ya mama screamin' out (holla-lu-ya)
And No I ain't a Vice Lord, But I kick it with niggas that bang that shit to tha left
C-V-L love tha BL, them thug folks that love low, down with my click to tha death
And naw I ain't Black P Stone, but when I was getting production with Villain we was chillin'
South side, Swole brothas, who long ass braids, who real niggas stackin' millions to tha ceilin'
And naw I ain't a soul, but got into it with dollar and rocked pink with jack Vo Vo
Knew all them niggas when my raps flow so slow, befo' I was ridin black benzes on black Mo Mo's
And I got plenty of friends and relatives that still be all up in tha mix
Out chere up in tha streets', well fuck this rap shit nigga, I got guns you ain't gonna do shit
I ain't gonna be frontin' an fakin' and actin' petite all in my music, not uh, that's too lame
When it's on it's on, I pop a nigga, when you gone you gone
You finna be wiped of the earth like a memory, What's dude name?

And naw I ain't a killa, But I'll stank a motherfucker while I'm hooded if he pull it
Make a nigga bite tha bullet, hit em
With tha chrome cause I got tah show it's on to tha fullest
And naw I ain't chief, But I'm a motherfuckin' beast when it comes tha runnin' in tha streets
Ain't been on it in a minute cause a nigga getting money when I do it's cause a nigga gotta eat
And naw I ain't solid but I got tha up most respect fo' a nigga if he holla it
Or if he ride unda tha six I know he be tha shit to tha real g's, I gotta pay homed
And naw I ain't hard, but on god I'll push a niggas shit back and leave em scard
Get tha inferred beam then go steal em N steam em, stank a nigga then go put tha car in my garage
I spit crack you gotta pardon my berauge, uh lyrics I'm throwin' is countin' tha vesauge
Tha thieves wanna be thugs tryna put on fo tha streets
Some beats but ain't got heart up in tha mind
Quit lying you metamorphicly speakin' motha fuckas
Don't want it with real niggas that's out chere
Give a description of hellava gun but you don't wanna really feel it
From real triggas that's out chere
(cause it's out chere)

[Chorus: x2]
Naw I ain't a playa, but in my city all tha bitches holla at me like I'm tha mayor
Devistatin' while I'm say-uh, but if you wanna make it bigger than words I gotta spray her
And naw I ain't a pimp, but peel a hoe fo' a fimp and I walk with a limp
While I be smokin' on the hemp and at tha party bitches sayin' look at him look at him
And naw I ain't no mark or no coward, come at me you gonna get yo lil' heart devoured
We don't buckle easy tah threats we be comin' after next for techs for sex, money, and power
Been doin' tha Bid fo' so long that everybody around us talk shit
Can't do nothin but hate off tha money we make
If we don't come up off of rappin' we comin' up off bricks
You lil' soft Bitch!

[Chorus: x2]
