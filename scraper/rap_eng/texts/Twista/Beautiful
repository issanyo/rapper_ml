[Hook: Perion]
I know your name
But that don't mean I can't call you, beautiful
Girl, I know your name
But that don't mean that, I can't call you, beautiful

[Verse 1: Twista]
Still I'm just wishing
When it come to looking for her, I am still on a mission
When it come to looking for love, can you feel a position
Can you feel a prescription, tell me are you still a position
The thrill is your listing, I'm tripping cause I feel like you different
I can see both of us dipping to the [?] kissing
Your vicious ass, so thick, don't give a shit cause you glisten
Delicious vag don't gotta hit the whip for no fishing
Got me caking like Napoleon
So fine, I can't stop watching, like you pop locking and breaking the [?]
Eyes is pop locked in place ain't no controlling them
Drop [?] for the church when I see you at the podium
Like coming to America, I try to let you know you stunning when I stare at ya
That's why I call you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)
Looking so fine when you step in the party, you gotta shine all over your body that's why I call you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)

[Hook: Perion]
I know your name
But that don't mean I can't call you, beautiful
Girl, I know your name
But that don't mean that, I can't call you, beautiful

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's the fact that you're beautiful, pardon me but that's the reason I'm acting unusual
Well done, it's everything back to which I do to you , get your nails and push the haters back like the cuticle
Macking I do to you, that's why the black is so suitable
Consoling her like she just came back from a funeral
Unhold another beauty that she got is not losable, I roll with her cause the top on the lac is removable
I feel like in a major way, she got a man [?] fade away
It's safe to say I wanna take you out places I know these dollars would get you
Popping bottles cause I know you got the model potential
To walk across the runaway, ain't you smart enough to become a lawyer someday
That's why I say that you (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)
So fine you are such an intrusion, on the computer you look like an illusion so I say you are so (beautiful, cause that's what you are to me)

[Hook: Perion]
I know your name
But that don't mean I can't call you, beautiful
Girl, I know your name
But that don't mean that, I can't call you, beautiful
