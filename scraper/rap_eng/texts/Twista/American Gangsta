American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust
I'm just an American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in God we trust

[Verse 1: Twista]
Chi-town bred
'Cause I gotta rep my city to the death
Annihilate 'em 'til I don't see nothing left
They love it when I spit it for the bitches now I spit it for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right, hat cocked to the left
Brother it's a [?], it's a focus on ya chest
I spit it for the Lords, and for the Folks and for the Crips and for the Bloods
I'm like an American Dream
I roll to the Green, with the Souls and the Breeds and the Cobras and Kings and the 2-16
Millimeter bullets for the niggas that are tryna do opposite
They don't really wanna see how psycho I can get
I don't really see a motherfucker stopping this
Trying to come at us, you facin' the the apocalypse
.40 cal'll have ya screaming "I don't wanna die"
I'm becoming nauseous with the fake thugs
So it's love to the real Gs and underbosses
To the niggas [?] case that gotta do it big
To get what nobody gave us, we was born into this system
So don't be mad at what you made us
Pull the pistol while I cock it and I bust it in the sky
One time for the U.S, for turning my niggas to gangstas
'Cause getting money is what they do best
[?] Capone
Gangstas is bosses
K-town is the motherfucking hood
The block is the company, come and step into my office
I'm an

[Verse 2: Twista]
Forever see me in a 'lac
Got work but ya never see me with a pack
A motherfucker said he never seen me with a strap
And I heard a motherfucker say he don't see me up in the hood
Lil' nigga I don't see you, 'cause homie my hood is worldwide
And getting money is what we do
Make ya knee joints lock when I freak you
Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo
Türkoğlu [?]
You killing the game like Pac, nigga we point Glocks like he do
See you
No one'll recognize that I'm the maker of the midwest
I'm like for real?
Controversy in the middle, I guess I'm like Shaquille
You can go on feel like ya feel
Leaving all the haters I would like to kill
But if you can hit me with the thangs
And lil' cheap for shit, let's strike the deal
Got the psychos in the city rolling with me
Ever ready to bust a shot at the [?] like duuu
I can bloody ya bodies like an animal
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food
Ripping through your flesh so I can devour your heart
Music is my playground, but if the rapping don't get you, I hit his head with the back of the pistol until the bitch nigga lay down
Ain't no competition I had to be fucking a twig?
Whoever coming for me? Guess not
I'ma get it every time I wanna get it and I'm living proof
It's a category F5
