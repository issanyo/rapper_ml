[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My car burnin', my weed burnin'
My bitch so bad, you touch her once
She burn you
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
My car burnin', my weed burnin'
My bitch so bad, you touch her once
She burn you

[Verse 1: Twista]
My crews are sittin' on ostrich
Smoking the blunt that's preposterous
Shoe box, a hundred in my closet
On the way to the bank to make a deposit
I get dollars and money cause I deserve it
Do what the fuck I want with it cause I earned it
Roll up one hundred dollar bill, then I burn it
Put some bud up in the bag then I serve it
Words is, comin down up out the way that I be such a professional when I purr
What I heard about rookies
They don't know what they be doing when they fuckin' with the huffers that are fuckin' with the girl scout cookies
Get the hash, light it up
If you got some bad bitches, then invite them up
I burn a blunt and if it's tires on a car we burn a rubber, give a motherfucker [?]
I know that weed gon' linger
Cause ain't no telling what we gon' bring you
You wanna feel it, cover the hole, and hit it in the bone
Now release your finger
Get the full effect up out the mechanism
When I hit the ism as if I was looking through a prism
Rollin' with Berner and Wiz and we get high as
I wanna get for my niggas that be looking through a prison
I don't take it for granted, so I blow
I'mma keep it with me wherever that I go
You ain't gonna tell me, I know that my eyes low
I don't give a fuck, I light up and ride slow
Everything I know burn, and my flows burn and my rings burn
And my watch burn and my truck burn
And my eyes burn and my green burn

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
My car burnin', my weed burnin'
My bitch so bad, you touch her once
She burn you
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
My car burnin', my weed burnin'
My bitch so bad, you touch her once
She burn you
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it
So much money I burn it

[Verse 2: Berner]
Climb .. get the beer right
Last time I should is air tight
Big Bern play around
Baby girl, keep a big gun on me, is a crazy world
Can I just get money on my whole team?
Break it down, I'm [clean] the whole day
Take break money blow it on a gold chain
Do a hundred, roll up
Please don't stop, and see the gun smoke
When I unload, better duck low
Only run from the undos like
It was fun though, in a black track with a [clean]
Stay on top, then you slapped up
PJ about to get wrapped up
Good pack, but the money gonna get stacked up
Took too many might OD
I'm low key, I'm OG  xanax and codine
Girl, I'm in that OC
Done a lot of crap, she says is a plus
She work late nights, now shake a [club]
She played a dwag, that's made you look
Count so much, you got paper cuts
Take 200 and burn it
So much weed that I'm burning
Hit the gas, my car burning
I'm popping tags, and that [hard cooking]
You got twelve girls and they're all [looking]
Pull up in that and they all looking
She's star struck, get your broad [?]
When she mad at you she car burning
