--intro (Twista)
C'mon, c'mon, ay T-Pain, T-Pain, it's Twista, comin' this way, c'mon
We gotta creep fast, c'mon
--verse 1 (Twista)
Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in the Chevy, and I'm ready with the woofers that'll beat up your block
And I got them takin' the machete for them niggas I could pay to get then get to talkin' I'ma heat up your block
If you wanna bring your boys, better bring the toys, better bring the noise, I'm bout to pop off(?) ammunition
Bodies I be hittin' when I get to spittin', everybody should have broken in, nobody listened, so now I
Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip, they all know who I am, ain't nobody talkin' shit, tell me when did they ever think that I was a hoe
Cuz I got killers with me, crips, bloods, g's and fours
And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen, we be thinking bout the money on a steady come up
And I got the niggas that be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
AK 47, Desert Eagle, SK, Mac 11, for them niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what you want, I'm a bone thug, get you while you sleepin' cuz you know I'm creepin on the come up
--chorus (T-Pain)
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am
I'm a mother f**king killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do
Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
--verse 2 (Twista)
Try to play a nigga and get over onto Twista I'ma see you when I see you and I wouldn't wanna be you
Drop that Desert Eagle when I'm rollin in a Regal when I'm lookin' at you evil through the eye of a needle
It's not a misdemeanor but a murder with a millimeter feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin' at your wheel
I kill a burglar when I be comin' for your shit I'ma get you for your goods when I run up in your crib
Tell me where your jewelry at, where your safe, don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face
Is it behind that portrait or is it in your floor
Just let me know so that I can hit it up cuz I got to go
Cuz I gotta throw it so I hit a lick on them niggas cuz it used to be that or I had to get 'em I'ma get 'em

Now I ride a burgundy Lamborghini Murcielago through the city because I know that'll kill 'em
Averaging a hundred yards per game, my competition better back up I'm the key running back
Niggas that ain't ready get the machete for the lyrical Jason of rap, I'ma keep coming back
--chorus (T-Pain)
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am
I'm a mother f**king killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do
Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
--verse 3 (Twista)
The lyrical assassin and I'm packin' a gat and I'll be attackin' the track up and I gotta package of the good
See a legendary representing for the city cuz I put it down ever since I been rappin' in the hood
Seventeen years ago on the flow and the show and these niggas when it come to beatin' me, nobody could
I was spittin' venom ever since them days UGK be rappin' and talkin' bout puttin diamonds on the wood
Rollin in an old Cadillac before I got some fame
I done got that gwap and that number one spot, now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin' money off rap then we got them things
Got the eight dollar hollers two for fifteens and four on the split and nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How about makin' a hundred every summer, pullin' up in a Hummer can make a nigga so sick
How bout canceling come up with hits and steady be getting' fans only because a nigga flow sick
So with no debate, everybody know I'm great, any mother f**ker that hate can suck my dick
--chorus (T-Pain)
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know me, but they know just who I am
I'm a mother f**king killer gorilla nigga you better act like you understand
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
Mother f**kers actin' like they don't know the deal but they know just what to do
Everybody talkin' in the streets so you know that I'm comin' straight for you
Cuz I'm a killer, a mass murder, the realest nigga, that you ever heard of
