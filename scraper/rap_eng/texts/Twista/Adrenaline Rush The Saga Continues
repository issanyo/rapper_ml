What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?

I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses
And the pain from these here, motherfuckin' verses
Ridiculous thirstses involving hearses to the dirt, shit
First picks and use 'n autos to work with slugs to the shirt, shit
(Just to squirt shit)

A wicked hit with an expert kick and burst 'til the earth split
Leave you hurt bitch, show you how worser than worst
Get in the zone, see the vein when the pain repel
And then they closin' the curtains, bitch
(When adrenaline's pumpin')

I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high
Got me reversin' clips and dispersin' shit

What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna jump off of the edge
I'm charged off of suckers gettin' shot up off the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(So tell me what it said)

Retaliate with lethal repercussion, I feel the reefer rushing
To go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal
To get the kickin' shit for niggas and bitches that I kick it with

I was born to get you pumped up
It's like some lead bust 'cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' head bust when you jumped up
'Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed

From smokin' shit that niggas hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act like a bitch on the side
If we have to then the whole Westside'll
Let the shit go on and ride when the trigga bust

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Pullin' up and bailin' out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit
Start up buryin' some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells in the garbage
The hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve
What I've accomplished

Yungbuck's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense like a compass
And starting on a journey established to stop this
Rushing up the hearts of other niggas to get 'em charged

What's the real reason?
All you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin'
I'm comin' after you cause I'm still breathin'

And y'all can't trace me
I bury my victims in the wall like Gacey, too lyrical
And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
My music is miracle like I'm biblical

Killin' like I'm nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up
And speed the fuck up getaway smokin' this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin' my veins I'm pumped up

And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggas that's gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama)
We too much for the industrialistic fuck
With this on the brink of fuckin' up some shit

Dismantle, deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggas got nerves to do
(What niggas got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you

Then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh, let semi close yo curtains fool
From killin' the verses fool, I be one of the worstest dude
(You, the who?)
I'm the worstest workin' about 9 millimeters above your surface
Unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose, bitch you hurtin'

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh

(Let your adrenaline rush)
Like when a motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make a trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass, kick up and bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Let your adrenaline rush
