Hey hey heeeyy hey
HEY! HEY!
Sometimes I go fast
Sometimes I just stop
Sometimes I take it slow, when I let the sex drop
But most of the times I go qu qu qu qu quick
When im hittin that shit, and she like it, she like it
But tonight she said she didn't want to go too fast
And tonight she said she want me to take my time
So, I took her down a said do you liked that, and she say hell yea
To hit it medium from the back said its cool and she said hell yea
She said ohh baby just take controll baby as long as you take it slow baby
And we can hit it all night baby
She gave me the green so I had to go
Start screamin my name when I went low
And everytime I start goin real fast, she looked at me and said
