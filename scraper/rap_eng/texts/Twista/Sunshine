[Intro: Sampled]
"When I wake in the morning love..
And the sunlight hurts my eyes..
And something without warning love..
Bears heavy on my mind.."

[Verse 1: Twista]
Let's get them dollars, let's get this money
Y-yeah, keep my mind on my..

I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin on the grind
Now when I wake up in the mornin I gots to hit a lick
Saw the 2003 Navi' on Spre's with a kick
Soon as my eyes see the sunshine
My thoughts is jukin the block and dodgin it one time
Peep how we movin them rocks and the pounds of dro 'fore I double my shit
I can serve 16 ounces plus 6 and get back 96
A killer for the scrilla, nigga, best not be stoppin
I gots to get them bigger, figures, fuck what you talkin
I represent the niggas ballin with jewelry full of sickles
Down to the niggas chasin million, that dream servin nickels
And I know - one day, I'm gon', come up
And when you see me don't hate, that I, roll up
Get paid whether you Legit when you slang, or tippin off 'caine
Until I take a dip in the Range I'm flippin them thangs
Gotta get some money mayn

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy

[Verse 2: Twista]
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that
I'm makin money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks
And if I ain't sellin no records, I'm servin 'em packs
I got a - clip full of hollows, money-makin's my motto
Semi-auto when my blow's in a bottle 'til I hit the lotto
With dreams of ownin a record label flippin words
My nigga flippin buildings better than he was flippin birds
I got the - mentality and the motive, I'm on a mission
For the money you can get it too, it's all about yo' ambition
Play yo' position, provide the plans and follow procedures
And a six hundred blunted with a pocket full of hundreds and Visas
Love when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cop then I get back up
Love when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when the grips stack up
And still in the evenin if I'm sleepin paper products
Soon as I get up, it's just another day another dollar
Gotta get that money mayn

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy

[Verse 3: Twista]
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin rollin Jags
Got love for the thug niggas who get it on the Ave
Love for those who can make a mil' and sit back and laugh
And love for the fine strippers who get it poppin ass
Love for the single parents that's workin through the struggle
Love for those who gotta make a livin movin muscle
Love for those who gotta watch the haters rollin bubbles
Causin trouble every time a young brother try to hustle
And if I can't legally make a knot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
And if it ain't no work we do a stick-up and whip up a concoction
I leave you face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money mayn

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
When I wake in the morning love, ohh-ohh-ohh
And the sunlight hurts my eyes, ohh-ohh ohhh
And something without warning love, ohh-ohh-ohh
Bears heavy on my mind

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
It's a lovely day, just got paid
Stack it up, be on my way
A lovely day, lovely day, lovely dayyyy
