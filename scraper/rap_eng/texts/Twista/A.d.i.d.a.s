Never less than the best, that's Gucci, Fendi, on my body cas
Blowing old good kush, let it take me somewhere
Probably mardi gras
In the club bitches kissing all on me
Like it's Mardi Gras
In my Adidas

And my outfit probably hard
On the west coast I'm a og

Blowing out of jobs
In my Audi cars

Outfit popping because I'm in my

Pants laid on behind tucked on my Adidas looking fresh as fuck

Wings in the back I'm hopping the air so whenever I see her, I see her
If a mama got on that leopard print I'ma holla in my cheetah Adidas
