(Let me in your world)
I rock your body all night
Sip on some (?) drink to make you feel right
Lay on the waterbed and hold you real tight
I be makin' you feel nice if you let me in your world
I can rock your body all night
Sip on some (?) drink to make you feel right
Lay on the waterbed and hold you real tight
I be makin' you feel nice if you let me in your world
(Let me in your world)

[Twista]
Hey love, what's up, come give me a kiss
Have you ever seen a po pimp with eyes as pretty as this
And still be the rawest, spittin' flawless game while I get my G's
I hit my B's, pullin' up on fees I bet I get piece
Cause I'm impressin', lovin', when I'm kissin' and huggin'
All into good rushin', touchin', better roll when I flush 'em
I'm causin' concussion, sportin' pellet, come here baby
My way will change, I used to kinda rugged my day
Let's dance, while we get our groove on I get known
If it's on, then Lexus she gon' get home
First get bucked up and sip on
G on the room and drink po wine up in the whirlpool
Don't leave my comb and pearl too
Leavin', let the girl cool my world, ooh
I like to get down, straight up you're freaky
You wanna meet me, just beep me, take the (?) and weakling
Drop the top and leave haters wishin' the (..?..)
Let's keep it a hood thang, you get busy on wool grain
I treat you precious as diamond rings, so don't cut me up
I start the fussin', I'mma get the bustin', now no thang, I gotta give it up
Cause all your love can make the hardest thug cry like a dove
Pull my mink over your shoulders when we leave out the club
Ain't no need to knock a con, I'm feelin' like Chaka Kahn
She the bomb like Lebanon, still fine with no Revlon
Just let the Don inside, I promise pleasure and sweat
I guarantee you ain't gon' be no regrets
If you just let me get it wet

[Hook]

[Christopher Williams]
Baby I'm fine, want you to be on my pager
I wanna know you, we can kick it like players
(..?..) make me really want you
Let me in your world
How can a man leave a woman like you're lonely
But still some phonies, call me when you need me
Sit down with my homies, pull up in my Lexus
Let me in your world

[Liffy Stokes]
I need love, it's off the hizze, think you can please me
Don't hurt me, take it easy girl, we on the E-Way
You know you met me when I crashed the bar
And why'd you kissin' on my neck, I'm 'bout to crash the car
So pass the 'la, relax baby it ain't far
Since you started askin' me questions on gossip about stars
Girl you better be on script on who you with
She's been forcin' Liffy Stokes from the mobsta click

[Mayz]
I'm chillin' at the click, with nums getting numb, I bumps
Tryin' to find a cutie to kickin' with, watch the risin' sun
Here she comes with them big legs, no fat on the back
What's up shorty, can we kick it tonight and choke on the sack
Come see as I foreplay, freaky at this slow-ass track
Big and black, had attention ready to dig in that
So what we just met, that don't mean I won't give you respect
I just fight the temptation to get your body real wet

[Christopher Williams]
Ahh, keep givin' them hand claps, baby
Watch them speakers be harmed
And the bass be soft, ooh
Ahh, keep givin' them hand claps, baby
Watch them speakers be harmed
And the bass be soft, ooh

[Twista]
On my elevator you can feel our love rise to the top
Cause on the way up to my condo, your ears pop
When I hit the lock I'm a villain, the mobstas make the killin'
As we lay on my waterbed with the mirrors on the ceiling
The wall too, got friends that's all true, I call Cru
Tryin' to fall too, I got tall brew, it's all you
Or like I be, let's shoot up to the club, like two tattoos
VIP, who gets who, no dancing with two left shoes
Do that fool, do that, do that, who that creeps on my hood
Do I see my nigs thuggin' but, dawg, y'all lookin' good
Ballers please, it's a straight playas party, can't fuck with these
Champagne and Henessies for my G's and stuck a piece, and uh
Haters please, no bustin' we up in place
Put 'em in the trunk, the flame
When I'm tryin' to get up with "what's her name"
The precious tonight I met, let's ride, I feel this like a set
While you're dancing, I'mma kiss off the sweat
That's how you let me get it wet
