(feat. Twista, Lethal Bizzle and Gappy Ranks)

[Intro - Twista]
Twista, y'all
This is a Kray Twinz thing
Gotta say love to everybody in the UK
And we put it down like this
Hit the club with

[Verse 1 - Twista]
Gold tims, gold chains, gold bentley with the matching coat
Give it stacks in the back cause I can smoke
The party gonna be kinda jumping so I gots to go
Ball hard it's the pick of the month
Line waiting round the corner when I pull up front
People played at the door say they wanna see ID
But I walk straight through cause I'm VIP, yeah
Clearing out the area for me cause they got love
In the club I'm a motherfucking fool
Shorty all up in my face popping her fanny in front of me so now I'm gonna find out what it do
Get out the way so I can order some crystal
Ain't nobody here mess with the Twista
Never try and run up on me, n*ggers posted around me and all holding a pistol

[Hook - Twista]
Now Shawty's on me
What's up I'm the twist and I wanna get to know ya
She poppin on me so I jack that ass 'till the party was
Took her home and she cut me to saw me moving so good she
I'm 0-5 miles an untouchable when we fall up in the club this is what we do

[Verse 2 - Lethal Bizzle]
Lethal Bizzle in the place yo where the titties at 36 tripple H thats cool give me that
Ye champagne and [?] give me sip of that
Never sip [?] with your gat
Pow, bring it dont bring it if you dont have big titties, big bum, big thighs to lie on my willy
Don't be silly the bizzle really down in the city
Enough talk let's get down to the nitty gritty
Clothes off, got it big [?]
[?]
Let me see you blow it off
From the bottom to the top just sit just what
Don't stop, don't stop, come on, Lisa
I know yu hear me saying yeah I be doing it
But if its that no girl I won't be chewing it
A lump in my sock yeah, that's my 22
You make a move, n*gger and I'll ruin it Pow, Pow
