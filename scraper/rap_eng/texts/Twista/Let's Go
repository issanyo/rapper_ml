[Royce Da 5'9"]
Huh?
We the best, Twist' you at nigga c'mere
Sift ya lye
C'mere

[Verse: Royce Da 5'9"]
Extremely hard to be the king of a city it's dis
A nigga that could twist like this
A nigga that could rip any shit that he get
Never balk and come with a metaphor like this
Flow like dis, never broke but flow for the dough like this
Never been a nigga that you know like dis
Cold like dis, but ah, it's just me and D-Mo like dis
Respect is a must, got every nigga in every hood checking for us
Never catch us catching the bus
Niggas got whips, niggas got loot
Niggas got troops, got guns, got clips (what)
Next big thing, iced watch to go with the necklace ring
Iced out to go with the rest it seems
More or less the more of the best you seen
Big buzz, only rolling with big thugs
We get in clubs you know you getting ya shit bust
Not too many ducks is going against us
If ya don't know now, you'll know when ya lift up
Rhyme till I can't rhyme no more, ball till I can't ball no more
Till I'm 5'9" no more, till the ice can't shine no more
Which ever comes first, let's go nigga

[Chorus: Twista]
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)

[Verse: Royce Da 5'9"]
One of a hundred niggas'll hate my shit
Eighty-nine'll bite, the other ten'll think of coming alike
Cuz my shit when it come to the mic, 99 outta 100'll like
Never disrespect a nigga gripping the tec, it's my shit
Put the flow in affect with my clique
Go to the death, flow the best, my spit, I'm sick, it's my shit
Try to get slick and niggas is getting hit
You don't want that do you? It comes back to you
And I ain't even trying to rap to you, so suck my dick, it's my shit
Too many willing to pin ya in rap
Put a ending to that, do the math with me
Straight to the lab, we're sending you back
Keep going, you know that no one can last wit me
Stay armed with the biggest of arms, got bitch-niggas hitting alarms
Every rhyme is strictly writing to harm
This my shit, keep every word of every verse in position to launch
Never gon' fail, never got plans of catching a L
I'ma forever prevail, whatever you yell
It's my world, everything else, c'mon nigga

[Chorus: Twista]
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)

Motown
Chi-town 5'9
Twista, let's go nigga uhh

[Twista]
Tell me who the fuck want what
What you murderous niggas is ready to make the deck go up?
I could cause a scene to make you throw up
Put a bullet in yo' gut, bat em down and leave the sto' cut
Cause homie you ain't got no choice ta
That why you running to a real rider like Twista, or Roysta
Let the thirty caliber anoint ya
Whodie won't even know he hit till he feel his shirt suckin the moisture
Voice ya opinion if ya want to
Kick-ass winner, kick up dust in the middle of the arena
Subpoena motherfuckers like the courts do
We'll blast shortly ya nuts bust and it won't be a misdemeanor
We them niggas that'll come approach ya
Shocking ya body our Bacardi keeps all ya nerves from bleeding
Until we heard no breathing, two undercovers
We coming we get the dirty even, they know it's serving season
Shit is good as gone, cause I gotta bring the goodies home
The petty packing penny brushing with the pretty pearl handle
Pistol, Pelle Pelle pants and the hoodie on
And you coming with the Midwest shit?
Remember how we took you, you tripping off how we did that shit
Somebody tell me where the weed at
Some niggas knew I was about to snap so he hid that shit
I was gon' get buck, come hard, get crunk
Go into a thing and let the rhyme ride
And hit them niggas from the blindside
And take the whole opposition down with my dog 5'9
Ceremony for the killers, busting 'em off
And coming off so you can bust yo' nut
Though I'm bout to bust yo' guts
But if yo' operation is hating, who the fuck want what?

[Chorus: Twista]
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
Who the fuck want what?!
Who the fuck want what, want what?!
(Playa tell me why you hating, cause you the one take)
(that from a nigga that'll open you up)
(You gotta send the deck up when we holla)
