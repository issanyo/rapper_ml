[Intro: Bishop Don Magic Juan]
Yeah.. no introduction is really needed
But it's, the Bishop Don Magic Juan
Chairman of the Board, of famous playas everywhere!
PLAYAS, PLAYAS, PLAYAS!
Representin, green is for the money
Gold is for the honey, ain't it man?

[Interlude]
Pimp-pimp on, pimp-pimp on
Pimp-pimp on, pimp-pimp on!
Then get your pimp on

[Verse 1: Twista]
Peep how the Twist' puttin' down the luchie while smokin' a lot of dro
Whatchu know 'bout checkin' yo' paper for a down-ass bottom ho
Or snatchin' yo' new fur model mink with the hood off the hanger
24-karat rings standin' a half a foot off the finger
Custom seats are amazin' tellin nobody could touch that bitch
Shoes my Maurie, piss by the month, he cut shock shit
Anything from my hoes when I ask, I get it
In the Cadillac I kick it, since y'all I wanted to be like macks and Bishop
Type wanna get up in the club, drinkin' Cris'sy from a gold cup
Flossin' my club, peepin' persons yellin' out "Chuuuch!"
Finna attract to trick politicians I'mma maintain pimpin'
You can't change pimpin', from the Stone Age to the "Space Age" pimpin'
From Southern mackin' in Memphis to the playa mo' when you shoot to Chi
In the black diamond with fuchsia dye pullin' out hoes like Supafly
All I gotta do is spit fo' lines
Now she got me chameleon gators with colors that flip fo' times
Now get yo'

[Hook]
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on, then get your pimp on
Pimp-pimp on
And if you want it the 'Llac with three hoes in the back
Pimp-pimp on
Feelin' like a mack while you checkin' yo' scratch (Pimp on)
Then you gettin' yo' pimp on (Pimp-pimp on)
Then get your pimp on

[Verse 2: 8 Ball]
Uhh.. yeah.. yeah, yeah
It's the Fat Mac - 8Ball to most of y'all
You a ho need a pimp, I'm the one you supposed to call
Shit talker, somebody's daughter she my street walker
She call me daddy, she a ho so that's what I call her
Or bitch or ol hard-head ass ho
The rougher I treat her she love a nigga even mo'
Brush my hair, manicure and do my toes
Knock bitches from them niggas who act like hoes
I'm mink draggin' out my 2-2 Paddywagon
Sittin' on 2-3's, diamonds on 24 karats
Ball out a bitch ass, and I don't make deals
Peel a meal from a pussy, know how that feels?
High heels and furs, Lexus his and hers
Hpnotic, ex' and sex mixed with the words
Pull up, and let the window down, here she come
The American way, I was taught how to

[Hook]
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on, then get your pimp on
Pimp-pimp on
And if you want it the 'Llac with three hoes in the back
Pimp-pimp on
Feelin' like a mack while you checkin' yo' scratch (Pimp on)
Then you gettin' yo' pimp on (Pimp-pimp on)
Then get your pimp on

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Playa getcha pimpin' on
Gotta getcha game together man, all your women gone
To start all over, ain't nothin' to a mack
Just put 'em to work, and watch yo' money stack
That's fosho doe, everyday a G a mo'
Asked your little sister, "Girl, why you wanna be a ho?"
She got turned out, like Red Riding Hood
Goin' to Grandma's house, now she lookin' real good
While the Big Bad Wolf try'na eat her out
Pay up, the cash is what we be about
Squares, we don't care if you don't understand
Players break out the game power, you don't wanna go there
Say it in your prayers you wanna be like me
You down on your knees but it's not likely
To ever happen, so I just keep rappin'
This real mackin', this ain't actin'

[Hook]
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp on (pimp on)
Pimp-pimp on, then get your pimp on
Pimp-pimp on
And if you want it the 'Llac with three hoes in the back
Pimp-pimp on
Feelin' like a mack while you checkin' yo' scratch (Pimp on)
Then you gettin' yo' pimp on (Pimp-pimp on)
Then get your pimp on
