(feat. Speedknot Mobstaz)

[Chorus:]
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga(put down that 45)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga(gotta let that 40 ride)
Don't wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga (let's do a homicide)
Don't ever wanna see you with no pistols if you ain't ready to roll n*gga

[Twista:]
Don't wanna see you with that 45 unless you gon' ride
If I say you gon' die motherf*cker I get so loud
What you be procrastinating I think you f*ck around with pistols cause they fascinating
You motherf*ckers ain't gon' do nothing
When you get through frontin niggas out here already know that you ain't gon' shoot nothing
End up at the pearly gates when they test you
Gotta dirty face but what you know about a 30 ain't special shit
And I know them hard words make you jump up with your? when you got the mosburg pump bitch
And the shortys lookin at you like a punk bitch
Cause you ain't making what you claim ain't gon' dump click
You gon cry when you hear them bullets dumping when them shortys come and ride on you(when the pistol click clack)
If you still alive will you really get the dumpin if you got that 45 on you?

[Chorus]
[Mayz:]
Once upon a time in the sha there was three real killas who bust guns and puff fire
They cut weight by the key and baggin every gram
Instead? bustin with the pistol in they hand
I'm preachin murder like a vicious reverand
About niggas who claim they shootin but they never seen 357s
Now what reason would you hold it up
Put that pistol down nigga pick that weed up roll it up
Twista up the light you don't really won die
Stop your blood clot crying
Your bullets don't fly
? aim smooth? I keep that smith and wessel with me like I'm blackmoon
Toss up the living room storm through the kitchen
I caught that nigga in the bathroom shittin and pissin'
What you shakin' for I thought you said you ready to ride
Don't be coming with me if you ain't strapped because I

[Chorus]
[Liffy Stokes:]
I keep a p95 nine milli ruger
You f**kin with a shooter
Quick to bloody your suit up
My aim impeccable point like a decibel
300 feet away in a tower snipin a festival
What you know about 9's and Glock 40's
And 45's see our 15's with the 5 pound slide
Thirty shot clips snub noses with the rubber grips
Wicked techs that'll put the kiss of death on your lover's lips
[? ] we get the squeeze nigga
Ak-47s make them bitches retreat nigga
Like a g nigga
I make em bleed nigga
? I'm bustin that's on my c nigga
My war chest is filled with ballers and techs
Ski masks gloves and vests so nigga what's next nigga
It's real thuggin you a bitch to the bone
If you ain't go through nothin shorty leave them pistols alone

[Chorus]
