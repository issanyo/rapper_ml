[Chorus - Ray J]
If we keep bumping up against this wall
They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh)
And if we keep makin all this noise
They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh)
Don't wake up my neighbors
People got to go to work (woo ooh woo ooh)
And if we keep makin all this noise
They gon' call the police (woo ooh woo ooh)

[Twista]
Hit it up against the wall like a beast
Hit it out in the hall like freak
How we're doing what we're doing
I don't see how nobody up in the building
Getting no sleep
How we get it in, we gonna get put out
For steady making noise bumping up against the headboard
And they be hating somebody gon' come and beat on the door
"get off of the landlord"
I'm a freak up in the sheets
Especially when I'll be fucking to the beat
The neighbors said if we keep it up
They gonna have to call the police
And we're gonna be up in the streets (woo ooh woo ooh)
Cause I act like a fool
And my chick knows she gets so pumped when she bump
Like a thump in a trunk on the couch where she hump but instead
It goes bumpity bump
We're about to get put out this hotel if you keep on screaming
We're about to get put out the crib if you keep on screaming
Girl your love is terrific and whenever I hit it
We never know how loud we was
We making too much noise turn the radio up
And put a sock in yo mouth because...

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Twista]
I'mma hit it like (uh)
We gon' do it like (uh)
We gon' do it like (uh)
Baby turn around
On the bed like (uh)
On the couch like (uh)
On the floor like (uh)
Steady make a sigh...

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got lil' momma sounding
The way she be doing when she play with all them toys
We better stop all this noise
They gon' mess around
And call them boys (woo ooh woo ooh)
I get it bumping in the house
And we makin everybody in they rooms sick
And all of my neighbors be tripping
And beating on the ceiling with they're broomstick
And if we decide to sip a little liquor
Let me go and see where I can find some from
The damage I'mma do when I get back is a guarantee
Somebody calling 911
All the freaky noise that you make it be makin'
Me want you to get up
Let me put this pillowcase in yo face
Fore you wake somebody' kids up
Even though I pay the rent for the crib
I don't really wanna cause a riot because
They gon' call it domestic violence
So we got to do it in silence because...

[Chorus]
