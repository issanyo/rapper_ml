Man dawg, it's some bad bitches out here that'll ("make you do wrong")
Whoa... go on girl ("make you do wrong")
I know everybody gotta feel this
Yeah you got somebody at home
But this bad motherfucker right here gon' ("make you do wrong")

[Twista]
I could tell when I dropped the top
I nippled off on the block, I was gon' get into some bullshit
That's the reason why I watch for cops
And keep me two baby Glocks, both of 'em loaded with a full clip
Still I gotta be on a mission for paper
But later on I'mma be hangin out with everybody
Never knew I shoulda been scared of the hottie
I got up with later on at the R. Kelly party
So I pull up the club in the Coupe
Look at how them jeans huggin the boots
Saw me ippy uppy icy as hell, f'rilla good smell
Have you ever seen a thug in a suit? Jackin bitches up
Socializin with everybody flirtin with girls but got plans to go home
'Til I felt the way you was backin up on the thang
Gettin down on the flo' I could see the top of the thong
She a (bad muh'fucker) she could bass a deuce
A fine-ass Medusa make your dick turn to stone
Take a look at the thong, get in the zone, took a shot of Patron
And I was gone, she a (bad muh'fucker)
Take a look at them hips, and how she lickin them lips
Like she was lickin ice cream
Ballin with a bad bitch that ain't yours on the scene
Listenin to some Al Green might ("make you do wrong")

[Hook 2X: Twista] + {Lil' Kim}
That's a girl that you shouldn'ta fucked with
But she so seductive, got a nigga head gone
Now you know it ain't right, got a girl at home
But tonight she the type that'll ("make you do wrong")
{This nigga that you shouldn'ta fucked with}
{But he so seductive, had a bitch head gone}
{Now you know it ain't right, got a man at home}
{But tonight he the type that'll} ("make you do wrong")

[Lil' Kim]
I got the champagne and popped the top
And then unlocked the lock, the Queen 'bout to get her bang on
I don't know what I'mma tell my dawg
When he look up and realize that a bitch ain't came home
Shit, he about to be rockin it
Lookin sweeter than chocolate, he got the smell of a Reese's
Break a fella to pieces, it's a hell of a thesis
Undressing his body with telekenesis
Got on top and then he knocked me off, until he was soft
Got in the car and dropped him off
Tryin to sink down as low as I can up in my seat
Cause I'm rollin in the Hummer and the top was off
My guy sleepin anyway and that's whassup
But I'm paranoid, drivin fast as fuck
Thinkin 'bout what I did, I try to sneak in the crib
Here come my man in the front, askin me what ("make you do wrong")

[Hook]

[Twista]
I don't know what you talkin 'bout
Baby whyon'tcha go on back to sleep
I was at the police station, when you hangin in the club
Wit'cha boys gettin drunk 20 deep it'll ("make you do wrong")

[Lil' Kim]
If you got up with a ho
Shoulda told the bitch use another douche
If you was at the police station, shoulda smelled like heist
But you comin in smellin like puss what'll ("make you do wrong")

[Twista]
Well I couldn't resist
Cause she was thick as hell and so cute
Steady comin at me, she was throwin it all on me
And I couldn't leave, she had a big dookie shoot, it'll ("make you do wrong")

[Lil' Kim]
Well I know what you talkin about
So we can do it like this
I'mma go and ride, you can do what you do
Cause I done met another brother with some bomb-ass .. it'll ("make you do wrong")
