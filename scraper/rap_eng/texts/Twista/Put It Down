[Verse 1]
Recognise legendary tales on the track from a certified po pimp
Recollecting the essence of that shit that I know you wanna hear
Go on especially if you smoke pimp, cmon and take a sip
Of the liquor of my life and get drunk of the way that the veteran get it in like he supposed to
Terrorising like the creature King Kong when it come to getting on the song, show em why they chose you
Spectacular when I be killing em off with the words, I murder the beat so they getting served like soft like
Off white let me show you how a baller dress, show how you how we ride, show you what a baller talk like
Some razzle dazzle with the words look at how he said
Make the ladies love it and they all say "hey now"
Put a hurting on them from the way you kick it
And you do it so smooth

[Chorus]

But the way you put it down
You don't mess around
You professional
You don't mess around [x2]

You're dangerous

Pardon the intrusion, its the real peep script, check the style I done started the illusion
Of mastering me thats what other cats attending but this here is patent pending and still imma be improving
Stutter stepping, strutting, rocking to percussions, coming up with something just to show them niggas "they ain't fucking with me"
Up on a pedestal kind of extravagant when I be bringing it, by the remarkable amount of haters if they want me come and get me
But don't judge me, cause i'm so strong. Let he who without sin cast the first stone
Cause imma simply pull a ho card and flow on, cause somebody told me to "go hard or go home"
New Twista on the legendary trax beat, fresh for everybody, angel dust
Like what you get when you cross Michael Jackson with Teddy Riley, dangerous

[Chorus]

Under my office desk imma get my dick sucked, bossed out, flossed out, flicked up
Then I throw my wrist up, get her tossed out, light up a cigar, lean back, feet kicked up
Or get in it like I'm an entrepreneur, connoisseur, it's a mantra but still I honour to do her
So I maneuver, she rode it and put on a hell of a performance don't even bother to boo her
Then when i go up in the party, i be cocky, cause lil mama thick and them bitches looking hella pathetic
Pull up in a Benz or probably Maserati and they undress her with they eyes like they telekinetic
Niggas looking at her hard so they all stutter
And bitches wishing they could take her clothes off of her
Classy girl, yeah i like the way you walk, yeah i like the way you talk
But the

[Chorus]
