[Intro]
Crook County
Let me spit that wild shit
That foul shit
I'm 'bout to get so disrespectful
Twista
Let's go

[Verse: Twista]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what to do (what?)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I'ma just fuck with you
I just be droppin' shit
Poppin' this and there ain't nobody stoppin' this
Let's see how 21 Savage I can get
Makin' my money come fast 'cause I'm the shit
Don't ask 'cause I can spit
Why you think I flow with locomotion like I'm smokin' on the dopest potion (why?)
Catch 'em overflossin' when I'm bossin', that's why I can poke a hole approachin' 'em
You can't play with the best
Hit 'em and keep 'em at bay with the rest
I got a million and one murder ways (what do you call it?)
Faces of death, as I play with your flesh
I get the knife and
Do it, do it, do it, do it to it
I get the gun and
Shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em
Blaze 'em then I boot 'em
Get the razor cut into your medulla
Oblongata, pop a collar, bottom dollar
I be blowin' on Buddha, Buddha, Buddha
I get money like I'm McGillicuddy
I smack 'em like silly putty
If you talk shit, your rims is ugly and your bitch is ugly
I'd rather fuck with your bitch's buddy
I be goin' on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
Because you know the beat don't stop until the break of dawn
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to do
Should I do something to have everybody in love with you?
Make 'em wanna bust at you
Should I do something to have everybody go comatose?
Shit that go coast to coast
Or do I hide the people in here catching the Holy Ghost?
Spit the flow from Overdose
I stood up in the [?]
That you see I can spit [?]
But see he and [?]
And if he talkin' shit, I put him in his place
And if you don't admit, I say you in a wrong
And I ain't a king and I ain't on a throne
[?], I can say I did it on my own
But come at me wrong, I kill him on a song
Now let me try to figure [?]
Think I know, think I know, think I know, think I know what to do
Murder shit, I got big burners, bitch, hollow tips
I say a lot of shit, just to fuck with you
I don't just end [?]
Do some shit that'll gon' put an end to you
Kill everybody inside of the house
The dog and women too (but what about the kids?)
Kill the infants too
I got shit that'll make a nigga wanna beat the break up off the nigga
Rub the face up off the nigga
Lay him out of [?], get the shakes up off the nigga
Seen him bleed before
Or shoot out with a purpose, or see the [?]
And if I just happen to shoot the civilians or innocent people then fuck it
Casualties of war
I saw when you was in the party, you [?] my crew, [?]
Went to the [?] and your buddy, and called you "a bitch"
Told you my flow was tailor-made
Piss you off like a fade away
Don't [?], I can still slit your throat like a razor blade
[?]
We gon' shoot up your mama house
And if you thinkin' that's some bogus type of shit for me to say
Then tell me what you gon' think when I say I will spit in your mama mouth
I be goin' on and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
'Cause you know the beat don't stop, don't stop until the break of dawn
