[Hook]
I'll be stunting on your body, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body, sliding on your body
I'll be digging in your body, body, body

[Verse 1: Spectacular]
I know you got a man, but he ain't hitting it right
You know what you want, but he ain't getting it right
But no more worries, I'ma put it on ya
Leave you dead tired, in a coma
Sex aroma, sex positions
The more you moan, the more I listen
Candle wax dripping on your back
Doing everything that your man lack
I'ma put it on you like real love
Give it to you, make you feel loved
That buildup when you max out
And I'm looking down when I back out

[Hook]
I'll be stunting on your body, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body, sliding on your body
I'll be digging in your body, body, body
Now, your body smiling, so, girl no wonder you ready
For me, baby
I'll be stunting on you, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body

[Verse 2: Twista]
So are you prepared for what I'm 'bout to do?
I'm 'bout to break you off until you break it down low
And take it down slow
Like I was a parachute, I'll take my time
But then when I lay you across the bed
You offer head and I said, "Wait a minute, hold on
Let me give it to you first", and then I open up her legs
Then my tongue start to play with it, stroke her
That's when she begin to burst and that's when I make her shout
Foreplay off the chain and that's without a doubt
She telling me that she loving the way I eat it out
'Cause when I stand up and let her put the dick in her mouth
I feel the top to hop on her, then hit her with the tip
Then I'ma try to get as deep inside her as I can get
Full of physique, the freak on her like I know she the shit
Put the bitch in missionary and then beat it like a whip
And then I'ma be
Stunting on your body, loving on your body
Hugging on your body
Yeah, she like the way I'm licking on your body
And I'm touching on your body, clutching on your body
Fucking on your body
Yeah, she like the way I'm kissing on your body
Fucking on the bed full of big faces
In a penthouse suite that's so spacious
For the time, she showed me I was gracious
Twista, where you at?

[Hook]
I'll be stunting on your body, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body, sliding on your body
I'll be digging in your body, body, body
Now, your body smiling, so, girl no wonder you ready
For me, baby
I'll be stunting on you, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body

[Verse 3]
I'm with you, girl, you got it, baby
Loving your body, do it so crazy
I want to go, to the next level
Legs wide open, girl, baby
She say my name, when I'm fucking on that body
She say my name, when I'm licking on that body
She say my name, when I'm eating on that body
She say my name, when I'm digging on that body

[Hook]
I'll be stunting on your body, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body, sliding on your body
I'll be digging in your body, body, body
Now, your body smiling, so, girl no wonder you ready
For me, baby
I'll be stunting on you, rubbing on your body
Banging on your body, licking on your body
I'll be rubbing on your body

[Outro (beginning at hook): Spectacular]
See, when I get in that mood
Ain't no telling what I might do you, girl
I might bite on you, lick on you
Stunt on you, baby
Doing everything your man won't do
Doing everything your woman won't do
Welcome to the life of the Sex God
Yeah, huh!
