[Intro: Twista]
Police! We have a search warrant!
C'mon c'mon eh T-Pain, its Twista come this way, we gotta creep fast

[Verse 1: Twista]
Watch as I hit it through the middle of the city in the chevy
And I'm ready with the woofas that'll flip your block
And I got the tech and a machete for the niggas actin' petty
Get to talkin an I'm a heat up your block
If you wanna bring your boys
Better bring the toys
Better bring the noise
I'm a pump both up with ammunition
Bodies I be hittin when I get to spittin everybody
Shoulda broke and ain't nobody listen so now I...
Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip
They don't know who I am ain't no body talkin shit
Tell me when did they ever think that I was a ho
Cause I got killas with me crips, bloods, g's and folks
And we be focused on the paper when we be up in the kitchen
When we thinkin about the money on the steady come up and I got the niggas
That be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
Ak 47, desert eagle, sk, mac 11 for the niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what ya want I'm a bone thug get you while your sleeping
Cause you know I'm creepin on ah come up

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Mother-fuckas actin like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
Cause I'm a killer a mass murderer the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Mother fuckas actin like don't the deal
But they know just wat to do
Every body talkin in the streets so you know that I'm comin straight for you
I'm a killa a mass murderer the realest nigga you ever heard of

[Verse 2: Twista]
Quit the playin nigga and get over on the Twista I'm a see you when I see you
And I wouldn't want to be you
Got the Desert Eagle
When I'm rollin in the Regal
And I'm lookin at you evil
Through the eye of a needle
Not a misdemeanor
But a murder with a millimeter
Feel the heat of Twista when I'm bustin at your whip
I get a burglar when I be comin for your shit
I'm a get you for your goods when I run up in your crib
Tell me where your jewelry at
Where your safe
Don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face
Is it behind the portrait or is it
In your floor just let me know so that I can hit it up
Cause I gots to go
Cause I gotta throw it so I had to lick on them niggas
Cause it used to be that if I had to get em I'mma get em
Never ride a burgundy lamborghini murcielago through the city
Because I know that'll kill em
Averagin a 100 yards a game
My competition better back up
I'm the e running back
Niggas that ain't ready get the machete
For the lyrical chasin' of rap I'mma keep comin back

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Mother-fuckas actin like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
Cause I'm a killer a mass murderer the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Mother fuckas actin like don't the deal
But they know just wat to do
Every body talkin in the streets so you know that I'm comin straight for you
I'm a killa a mass murderer the realest nigga you ever heard of

[Verse 3: Twista]
The lyrical assassin the pocket I got in
I be attackin the track
If I got a package of the good
See a legendary representa for the city
Cause I put it down ever since I been rappin in the hood
17 years of goin and flowin
And showin these niggas when it come to beaten me nobody could
I was spittin venom ever sinse the days UGK been rappin
And talkin about puttin diamonds on the wood
Pullin up in a old cadillac before I got some thangs
And I got that gwap and the numba one spot now I ride a range
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
And if we ain't makin money off rap then we got them thangs
Got the 8 dollar hollas two for 15's
A 4 and a split a nine piece so you can hit the whole brick
How I win it by makin a 100 every summer
Pullin up in the hummer can make a nigga so sick
How we constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
Showin no debate everybody know I'm great
Any muthafuckas that hate can suck my dick

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Mother-fuckas actin like they don't know me
But they know just who I am, I'm a mother-fuckin killa gorilla nigga
You better act like you understand
Cause I'm a killer a mass murderer the realest nigga that you ever heard of
Mother fuckas actin like don't the deal
But they know just wat to do
Every body talkin in the streets so you know I'm comin straight for you
I'm a killa a mass murderer the realest nigga you ever heard of
