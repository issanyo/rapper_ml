[Verse 1: Twista]
All they know about me is how many times they seen me high
They don't really know what I be goin' through
They don't really know about how many times I cry
They don't know about the struggles and the pain
They don't really know how many nights I been up
But when I'm ready, I'mma open up
When I'm ready, I'mma open up
Somebody ask me, 'Twista, where you been?'
I tell 'em, 'I don't know, cause the curtain was closed in the Benz'
Too cold with the pen
Comin' off the top I can flow from within
Years in the game, I could study, get in
Cause they can't figure out where do I fit in
They don't want to know if I'm legendary or not
They don't want to know if they want to give me the throne
They don't really know if they gon' play my song
It don't matter, I'm cold, so forever I'm on
They don't want to say if I'm the fastest
Even though I held the record for years and I do it with finesse
They don't want to get me in a war
Cause I'd rather him 'em with a fast flow than display my stress
Well, here it go
Am I the magnificent with a weird flow?
That you don't want to give me the respect I deserve
Cause I be comin' superb, I'm not your hero
But I'm one of the coldest, bitch
I said it before and by now everybody should know this shit
Don't want to have to load this clip
I'm nearer to Starbucks, it's just to get you to hold my dick
Cause I will
Don't be the victim of a copster's steel
And a motherfucker got killed
Cause I'm a gifted cause I got good
If I can't give it cause I got skill, and I will spit it on a track
Would make it so a go-getter could stack wheels
Sorry if I offended you
I just got to be real and tell you how I feel

[Hook: 1Mic]
Business never did shit for me, remember that
Grindin' all by myself, remember that
Started from the bottom, now I'm here
But they tryin' to hold me back
Remember that? Yeah, I remember that

[Verse 2: South]
I'm surrounded by these demons and they drive me crazy
They love to see you fail, I guess that's why they hate me
Lately, I been stayin' away
See, you wouldn't believe the bullshit, but now it don't amaze me
I grew up gettin' beat on, my world ain't got no heat on
They ask me what I be on, but then find out that they need some
That's why I did this new song, that's why I keep that two long
Been in too deep for too long
Those who doubted me and want my way gon' prove wrong

[Verse 3: Johnny Maycash]
Yeah, to anybody who doubted me
And my whole damn team wrong
Wake up in the mornin', this a theme song
I'm gonna make a lot of money of this green (-)
But I refuse to ever sell my damn soul
Middle of the summer, but my flow's cold
I want to meet up, but your bitch is for my old hoes
All I need is a beat, I'm goin' loco
Yeah, a lot of people tellin' me that I'm next to blow
They can keep the fame, I just want the dough
If I hear my family eat, then we good to go
I got to stack this bread, then I'm out the door
