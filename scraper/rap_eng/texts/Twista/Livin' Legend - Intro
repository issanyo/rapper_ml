[Verse 1: Twista]
No card, no nothing, I was hustling, I was selling game on the bus /
Crutch time a little pressure nigga I can't win the game in a clutch /
Niggas on the gram, flashing money looking like a stain gain to us /
Pull up with your main thing, nigga I just want a brain not a gut /
Then you can have the hoe back, play with me and get split like a cantaloupe /
We making hoes sick, I got the antidote, I be taking pictures whip it and dispense it on my lap /
Every time that I spit it I snap, they like the rhythm, they like the passion /
They like the talented rap, who fucking with me I'm winning that stat /
She let me hit it then neck, she gon' let my nigga smash that /
I ain't lie, I ain't got to stunt about shit, gang signs /
40 up under my shit, bang that, rim 40 all on my wrists /
My bitch got mad so I got her the same shit, now she's fine  /
Why the pussy niggas got a problem with me? Maybe cuz I fucked his hoe and he saw her with me /
Saw me when I pulled up and she hopped in the car with me, yeah she agreed to have a menage with me /

Hook
Pay in the middle of the fall, when I was aiming right at the middle of your head /
No choppers, no ARs (none of that), it was 25 calibers instead /
Feeling like everyday could be my last, shit I was on the mother fucking end /
Till one day I woke up, I was introduced to rapping, how to make bread /
By the time, Dre dropped that Chronic, it was [?] on the mood they way I spit /
Every time a nigga wake up, I was always on another lit /
And every night I lay down, I was always on another bitch /
That's why I'm  getting money right now, we get it in nigga hand over fist /

Verse 2
No L's no nothing, I was still driving, riding with a strap in the rental /
Getting to it with a nigga, pull up on him with it hanging like a window /
100 ground [?}, lit his ass up and [?] /
Should of play your cards right, nigga now you got your family in the middle /
Since sixteen, I was playing around with guns like a [?] /
Way before I really try to be a mc, I was squeezing them bitches till it was empty /
Way before they put the charges against me, I was into rap [?] /
In the basement starving, just me, with nobody else around it was just beats /
So I had to get it, I wanted some better living, fresh out of the kettle with it /
Been packing a metal with it, I'm hoping that that'll get it /
You make a better decision, I feel like the devil with it /
Stay the fuck out of my business, I feel like I'm handling it /
Scandalous, high of cannabis, rappers want to rap like this, they try to channel this /
This shit's easy to me, I dismantle it, I'm the catalyst, somebody tell em what time it is /

Hook

And every night I lay down, I was always on another bitch /
That's why I'm  getting money right now, we get it in nigga hand over [?] /
