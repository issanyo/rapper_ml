[Dreadlock Rasta]

[Verse 1: Twista]
It's the return of the rattatatat
With the fatta' backpack full of raps for
Backtracks plus that gat that I carry like a cellular
Then they can tell you that
Babyface bandit don't play and I 'fore they say [?]
Done Daddy
Wit more Beef than a patty from some suckers
That tend to diss the Twista, to hell with dem dumb {fuckers}
Respect the way I kicks 'em, I'm rippin' vics up
Bloody spits up, and never gets up
When I speed, nah clicks up
Rips up with grammar when I damage ya like Jeru
I'm torchering sucker punks, on backtracks I see Dres do
Hit 'em with lyrical dropkicks, poke eyes with chopsticks
Flyin' more MCs heads than cockpits
With criminal topics, as soon as the Glock spits I drop vics
Quick to commit a murder
My grandma [?] told me to let my fat flow hurt ah
Sucka that think he's phatta, ya got ta, smack that
Fool, it's the return of the rattatatat
