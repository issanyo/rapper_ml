[Twista] Oh yeah
Your boy Twista
[Mr. Capone-E] Yeah, ha ha
[Twista] Mr. Capone-E in the place
[Mr. Capone-E] Oh!
[Twista] The Midwest, West Coast connection
[Mr. Capone-E] West coast!
[Twista] And this is how we put it down, you know what I'm talkin' about
[Mr. Capone-E] That's right
[Twista] A lil' somethin' for the ladies

Chorus: Fingazz (Mr. Capone-E) {Twista}
It't not love
Don't get it twisted (Don't get it twisted)
I'll make you
Feel so good, but you gotta slow down
It't not love {It's not love}
Don't get it twisted (Don't get it twisted)
I'll make you
Wanna do it all night, all night
Said it's not love {It ain't love, shawty}
Don't get it twisted (Don't get it twisted)
I'll make you
Feel so good, but you gotta slow down
It't not love {It's not love}
Don't get it twisted (Don't get it twisted)
I'll make you
Wanna do it all night, all night
Said it's not love

[Verse 1: Mr. Capone-E]
It's not love coming from a straight thug
All up in the club, lookin' pretty, wanna bug
That's what it was, that was love, so lady, here I come, so pass me the bud
Gettin' you, while I'm sprung out the tongue, ya cute playboy
When I stunt
One by one, you standin' in line, ain't one by one, I'm checking out your rump
Oh yeah, it's Mr. Capon-Double E
Internationally known as a pimp daddy
I'll make you feel so good, heinas scream
"We love you, baby"
Stop me if my cocky, but my game is so trump tight
Have you screaming out my name
Baby girl, you looking fine
Bottom line
Lady, lady, there's no love from this jock
I just wanna get you hot
Find your spot
Never will I stop
Hit it, quit it, are you with it, let's just keep this little secret
But don't catch no feelings when you sqealin'
Don't get it twisted

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Twista]
Ah
Say I was rollin' in the 'Llac with a shawty
But now, I gotta go and catch me a hottie
Chillin' in the cut up in the V.I.P
Now I'm after your body in the after party (That's right)
With a (???) gettin' love
Get a girl to back it up, spend a stack for the buds (That's right)
You a one-night-stand, shorty, tell me where you actin' to love, in the back of the club (Come on)
You gone get up in a Bentley with a baller
Let me take you to a tele, but the haters can't get me (Mm hmm)
Hit that ass, and I even spank titties (Mm hmm)
Now give a little to the homie Frank Nitty
Now give it to Mr. Capone-E
Ain't no talk about "It's only me"
Get it on with a G
I'm a never leave you lonely
Got you rollin' on chrome B
Come and get me that there
Like the way I pull your hair
Spank on your derierre
Make you scream "Ouch," give it to you while we fucking on the couch
Give it to you while we fucking on the chair
Look at lil' mamma, sweatin' good, gettin' rocked by the balls
Gotta hit it hard, not too soft
Never get it twisted cause you fuckin' with the Twista
When I pop you off, I'm a drop you off
It's not love

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Mr. Capone-E]
I wanna make you do it all night long
Play it again, just sing this song
West coast, midwest, dirty south, east coast ladies, just drop that thongs
Let's get it on, pull the alarm, it's a playa with that
Thug-like passion
I keep on askin', remindin' it just a one night stand-in
Don't matter my company, but baby, pace a play
And if you get that little chance, mija
Let's run away
Anyway, it's all day, by the way, I gots to leave in a rush
A quick nut
Don't you fuss
All I did
Was just fuck

(Fingazz in background)
[Twista] It ain't love (It's not love)
[Mr. Capone-E] It ain't love (Don't get it twisted...)
[Twista] It's a one night stand
[Mr. Capone-E] That's right, you know how we doin' it
[Twista] Shorty, give a lil' somethin' up
[Mr. Capone-E] That's how it's goin' down (It's not love)
[Twista] We put it down (Don't get it twisted...)
Twista from the Chi
[Mr. Capone-E] West coast baby, Cali
Mr. Capone with the E
Don't get it twisted (It's not love)
Oh! (Don't get it twisted...)
