[Verse 1: Tung Twista]
Intro, I break a- break a brother ten fold
Oh, 10-4, stomp 'em like a dinosaur
Poor excuse for an MC, so-so singers
The things I bring'll snap like fingers
Rugged hip-hop, I'm gettin' funky like a cheap perfume
Doom, take 'em from the womb to the tomb, whom
It may concern, I return from the mentally dead
To fly a sleep sucker duck's head
A thoroughbred in this talent, I be snappin' like I'm coo-coo
Try to fade my spade, you made a boo boo
Suckers say 'ooops', troops - I spank 'em if they rap happy
Never calm, 'cause I'm snap happy

[Chorus]
Am I snap happy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Yo, tell me - am I snap happpy?

[Verse 2: Tung Twista]
Snap happy - snappin' on those who think I rap crappy
The Tung is snappy, rougher than nappy, you can't outrap me
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
I don't avoid the noid, I destroyed the noid
So I gotta make a scrub pay, hey
Suckers I slay, they lay stinkin' in the subway
Focus, my rhythm will scrub, say rub-a-dub-dub
'Cause I'ma step into 'em like a bathtub
I make 'em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls
Then run through rappers like school halls
I'm breakin' sucka punks' backs
Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks
My rhythm be delicious while
I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this
With a dramatically vicious style
I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Loch Ness
Monster, just because I want ta
1 to 2, I'm comin' through
Swig 'em like a brew, ooh
You think I bit off more than I can chew?
I break a sissy up with no twist
Don't make my tongue flappy
I still can be labelled as snap happy

[Chorus]
Snap happy
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
DJ Jihad get loose

[DJ scratches]
Hit me

[Verse 3: Tung Twista]
I snap and make 'em yield
Spin my tongue like a windmill
And crack your skull like a windshield
Show me where a sucker makes an error, I give him terror
Be smooth as Aloe Vera, they run like mascara
I turn 'em over like a page, engage
I eat 'em with rage and trap the duck behind my rib cage
Flow, my jock'll make 'em blow
Want me to take 'em slow?
I flow speed till they can't take no mo'
Get the urge to see what I'm servin', bee
I make an emergency for the sucker to get surgery, word to G
You thinkin' what I said'll miss
But I'm the head of this, what I said'll diss
'Cause it's a mega-diss
If you sleep get into bed of this
But if you wake up, I'ma fly that dreaded head like Pegasus
I'm a son, but for some reason they wanna call me the rap pappy
I guess it's 'cause I'm snap happpy

[Chorus]
Snap happy
Yo, tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Tell me - am I snap happpy?
Yo, tell me - am I snap happpy?
