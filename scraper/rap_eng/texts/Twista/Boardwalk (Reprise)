Ring Announcer:
Stay tuned for exclusive interviews by our favorite reporter Molly Cassidy

Ranna Royce:
I'm so drunk under the boardwalk
I'm a surfer but I'm riding my own wave
I see one coming and I'll pretend it's you
On my surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood

Tim:
Under the boardwalk, in secrecy
Under the boardwalk, graffiti
Under the boardwalk, telling stories
Under the boardwalk, my territory
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk
Under the boardwalk

Twista:
Shoutout to Jonathan Hay, Ranna, Iliana Eve. Ya'll know what it is

Ladies and gentlemen- welcome to the motherfuckin, the motherfuckin circus bitch

Ohh, uhh, ohh
From Cali to Florida the glistening seas, seas, seas, seas
(Repeat)

Thank you, I love you

Twista:
It's about blunt wraps and lipstick baby
