[Intro: Twista & Elephant Man]
It's the Elephant Man (that's me)
And the Twista with another hit song (alright)
And my nigs YoungBloodz (yeah)
To show em' how to get it crunk up in the club

[Bridge: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down

[Verse 2: J-Bo]
Now turn around and jook and drop low to the floor
And swing it back and like that, there ya go
Pop the bottle, get loose for ya folk
And roll them hips to the left fo' once mo'
Now shake it up, bend over, spread wide
We back again and on a whole new ride
With Elephant Man and Twista, YoungBloodz
We off in this biatch, in the middle of the club
So bring it here and lil' mama fall in
And tell yo' crew that they could join in
So DJ spin it back, I got 'em tickled
So you best be runnin' when you here that whistle

[Verse 3: Twista]
Now come here shorty won't you show me that love
Back it up on the Twista when I come up in the club
Look at lil' sista while she twurk that thang
Make me wanna let her hop in my 0 fo' Range
Now jook it on me while I blow my bowl
Sippin' Hypnotic while you drop it down low
I be that nigga reppin' Roc-A-Fella crew
Come pop it for me, let me see what that do
Come here lil' mama you so thick it's ridiculous
Look at ya fatty I like how you shake it, twurk ya
Titties an thighs
Ya bodies elagent, other shit is irrelavent
It's the Elephant, YoungBloodz and Twista from the city of Chi
Ya jook ya body like ya come from Jamaica
Go in my pocket to give ya every blunt, clop thing
Look how she jookin' that booty, chick like a wing and winding
So when ya here the cut drop, sing

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
You up inna di club and di music sweet
You fi jook gal (jook gal) jook gal (jook gal)

And jook gal (jook gal) jook gal (jook gal)
Hand pon di ground, bumper inna di air
And jook gal (jook gal) jook gal (jook gal)
Junk in di trunk, wine up ya rump
And jook gal (jook gal) jook gal (jook gal)

[Verse 4: Sean Paul]
I'm Sean Paul from the home of the strip club
I don't trip, I tip, show the girl love
I know you know the face, Ima Youngblood
But don't talk, just jook girl, take a dub
She say she love my song, wanna cuddle up
I told her show me her thong for another dub
I came for some action, I don't wanna hug
If it ain't happnin' hit another club
Drank somthin' crunk, cup of "Ones Eye"
Make her shake somthin' 'til the bank run out
But I'm straight shorty, I ain't finna run out
Make her drip from the night 'til the sunlight

[Kiprich] (Elephant Man)
(Put ya hands on di floor!!!)
Cock up ya bumper a likkle more
Cock it up, mek mi slam it like a door
(Put ya hands on di floor!!!)
You hear, mi love it when mi talk to her
Split and spread out like manure
(Put ya hands on di floor!!!)
Every man love see girl galore
Shabba say, him waan more pon more
(Put ya hands on di floor!!!)
True ya goody goody, you get an encore
Every girl fi brukout like sore

[Bridge: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down

[Verse Elephant Man]
Love see girls a wine, love see girls a shake dem behind
Search di dance floor 'til mi find weh mi flip di coin

Hold up let's go back in time, memba genie wine?
Memba genie when ya see mi gimme grind?

[Hook: Elephant Man]
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
Shake that booty, turn it around
Back that ass up, wine go down
