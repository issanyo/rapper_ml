[Johnny P]
Do you wanna ride with me (yeah, ooooooh)
Do you wanna smoke my B (ooooooh)
Never can't you take my G's
Myyyyyyyy.. (ooooooh)

[AK-47]
I ain't trippin got the split up the front
Approach you with a limp while I hit on the blunt
Your pager goin off? (awe, that ain't nuthin)
Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin
Blow even though that the clique's on somethin
Tryin to cut me up, yeah the trick's on somethin
The corner of the parlor with them niggas they bumming
Reachin for the gin and the Hen in my stomach
I'm lookin at the do' females still comin
Lookin to my left and the B's still comin
Lookin to my right and the drinks still comin
Tryin to shake the dice but the girl lookin cunnin
Circlin the do' where the money start runnin
Took a pause, hey y'all wassup
Head hunters in the double-R, is it a double car
Pulled over to the car
So I, ashed Proceeds, to pass the B's, low cash

Chorus: Johnny P (repeat 4X)

Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
I'm a Po P-I-M-P

[Belo]
What it be like?
P-I, M-P, hoes - plenty
Comin straight from the Windy
Choppin up tens and twenties, MMMM!
Lean back in the corner with the Dobb hat
Nominated just to ball like a Democrat
In the cut with hoes, and I suppose
That I've been chose, to mingle with the hoodrats
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm - got it down packed
You call it what you want I'm keepin all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm living just to ball black
Gettin paid in the game made me roam free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
A/C, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put it in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm making money you the wrong freak
Nickel dime or a twenty don't approach me
If you do, we could have sex, in the Caddy or a Lex
But keep on the low-key

Chorus

[Bridge: Twista]
Well a motherfucker used to say I might be broke
But now I'm stackin C-notes, still dope
Different strokes, same folks; hangin from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back I might come let ya take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another blackwood, playa pimpin to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shawty what's the deal?

[Twista]
I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be "Passin' Me By"
I'm a nigga with P's and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fe's drips at us full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
They was serving the rock 'caine, then I came
Flippin flows like hoes when Twista drop game
It's like, awww suki suki now, lookie here
Sing a phrase while I trace on my hog road
Devine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin and she peepin that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin, deep as the Mediterranean
Trying to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin cold women
Bendin and grinnin my head spinnin
While we smokin on hemp, we still po' pimpin'

Refrain: Johnny P (repeat 2X)

Do you wanna ride, slip inside of your thighs
Oooh-oh, oooh-oh, oooh-ohhhhh

Chorus

[Johnny P]
Wooooh-ooahahhhohhhh!
Do you wanna riiiiiiiiide with JP
Do or Die, whoahhhh-oahhhh..
