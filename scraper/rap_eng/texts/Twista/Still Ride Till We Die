Chorus: 2x
Still ride till we die
Still ball till we fall
See me and Twista up in this bitch
And we figurin' we ride on all of ya'll
Don't even stallin' ya'll
Givin' the people hall-to-hall
Midwest is takin over playa wit all my dawgs

[Verse 1: Coo Coo Cal]
From the Mil to the Chi I ain't gon' lie dawg we holdin' it down
We rollin' now
Defeated the streets, on lyrics and beats and they owe us now
The rest of the world is slowin' down
Tryin' to hold us back
They pissed
Cuz we don' got on all these damn discs
And holdin' stacks
Act like ya'll suppose (?) stop hatin'
Nigga the world is tired of waitin'
On a nigga like Coo Coo Cal and Twista spittin' on your station
Ya'll facin' drama that I'm gonna kick up
Strapped in the back of a pickup
Workin and jerkin that faulty five like I had {quick pause} hiccups
I'm gonna rip this shit up
From limb-to-limb
Nigga twenty-four hours
Ten-to-ten
When you tired of hearin' my song it's gonna get spinned again
I fuck wit Infine and them, and we stay strapped
From way back in the days, slippin', can't even pay nobody to say that
Ha, this is the payback from the dawn helped the Mid West
And West say I'm crackin, South say I'm ballin, East say that kid's fresh
Yes nigga, the Midwest is takin' over
And Candy Coupes and trooper trucks, 600 Benzes and Range Rovers

[Hook: 2x]
Still ride till we die
Still ball till we fall
See me and Twista up in this bitch
And we figurin' we ride on all of ya'll
Don't even stallin' ya'll
Givin' the people hall-to-hall
Midwest is takin' over playa wit all my dawgs

[Verse 2: Twista]
C'mon then, feel the buzz from a beat freaker
Kill a nigga (?)
Street preacher
Swisher Sweet chief
The reefer wit the heat seeka
On my street sweeper
Bloody body leaka
Key keepa, 20-pound holda
Hydro rolla
White rhino wit some doja
I'mma mighty ol' soulja
(?)
Can you find any licks that'll match my mixture
For the scripture
Bet a nigga spent cha
When my crew mob up thicka-n-thicka
Whoever don't show love I can shower you wit slugs like rain drops
Bullets if you use your brain box
No safety automatic so the gunfire can't stop
Coo Coo Cal and Twista bitch
Smokin stuff stankin like pissin shit
Disappear like Mxyzptlk
After we don' mask up and hit some licks
Rollin' up too thick like Frank and Jesse James
And we got them thangs
Don't block the Midwest, time to lock this game
Without the G-House ya'll some lames
Cuz we got
(Every lil thang you want)
Thug niggas wit skills
Pounds of pills
Bricks 'n bitches on fifty, thirsty for mills
We got
(Every lil thang you need)
Lay down on the table
Connects like cable
Where the pen and label
So fuck a record deal

[Hook:2x]
Still ride till we die
Still ball till we fall
See me and Twista up in this bitch
And we figurin' we ride on all of ya'll
Don't even stallin' ya'll
Givin' the people hall-to-hall
Midwest is takin' over playa wit all my dawgs

[Verse 3: Twista]
Is it all an illusion
Or do Twista and Coo Coo Cal cause contusions
We ballin' and bruisin'
Drop the shit that'll get y'all in the mood and you stallin and losin'
While I chop Carache like karate
Steady on a lick like Gotti
Bustin' off a shottie
From a black Denali
It's gonna bruise your body
Move your body
Lodi-to the-dodi
Bring a hottie, to the party
But if you come in wit ice on then it might be a robbery
Crisis for the prices, ices
Get up when you see chrome devices
I'm righteous and I like this
But if you get outta line I'mma leave you lifeless nigga

[Coo Coo Cal]
And I'm gonna do you righteous
Might just, buy your wife that black dress
A lesson learned wit a soft turn
Niggas get burned fuckin wit the Midwest
Wit the smell of flesh, on Highway 94 from Milwaukee to Chicago
See anything in our path it's down to get bobbed ho
Cuz we like to mob roll, wit them .50 cal
See me and Twista
Get this mutha fucka crackin' and shut your city down
Really now, ain't no mutha fucka stoppin' this
Why you waitin' and hatin'
Keep skatin' on them daytons nigga droppin' hits

[Hook:4x]
Still ride till we die
Still ball till we fall
See me and Twista up in this bitch
And we figurin' we ride on all of ya'll
Don't even stallin' ya'll
Givin' the people hall-to-hall
Midwest is takin' over playa wit all my dawgs (echo:4th time thru)
