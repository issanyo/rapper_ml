You ain't neva heard a slow jam like this
You ain't neva had a remix like this
You ain't neva been freaky like this
Rollin on 24's like this
Neva had a pool party like this
Neva sipped on cris much as this
Neva been to an island like this
Make one wish and I'll give you all this

Girl u remind me of my jeep and my s5
First I was on top of you now u sayin lets ride
Freakin yo body so good I give you wet thighs
When we get together you know we make the sex live
Take you to paradise while massaging u down
Feeling betta with twins m√©nagin u down
Make u explode and now I'm calming u down
So good that u don't want me to bother u now
Now listen here
Come and kick it with the players, ghetto majors and the thumpa sprayers
And we neva got no room for no haters
When we pull up on them 24 omegas
While I'm smoking on a gar seeing Vega
You by my side we be on one when we hangin
What earthquake say is wrong in a relationship
We a corporation lets take over the nation
Let me get up with u girl
Don't be trippin on yo guy he gone be up when the heat come out
'cause u could rub the lamp three times and still won't a muthaf**ka like me come out

You ain't neva had a playa like me to take you shoppin
Take u to the crib and sex u nonstop and
Bone thugs top droppin
Vip with the bottles poppin
So clean we gotta take a picture
So sexy I wanna get wit u
Girl I'll be singing thrilla
While u be squeezing pillows
And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if u ever going through something
I promise to make it betta
Ya just keep on lovin a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell u its time
U ain't neva gotta want for nothing
As long as u down and u ready to ride
I wanna give u them butterflies
Have yo head all off up in da sky
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

U ain't neva rode in a Bentley lookin like this
U ain't neva got up with a thug nigga like this
Or got with a balla that spit to the rhythm like this
Or kick it with a platinum plus nigga like this
Well looka here now come look at how the player T drop the top
Rollin' through flick and ma music bumpin on da trump train
Kelly and Twista peep how we rock the block
Platinum Ferrari it nothing shorty
U its chump change
Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend (4 to the fend)
Won't u get in
While I'm steady blowin smoke in the wind (smoke in the wind)
Hoping to win
Now speakin words to my head in the bed
Then after we work then we can do it that one way
Lookin thick as a loaf of bread by legs
And u get at shakin the way the twista make the tongue play
And this is for tha love and the ladies
The fine women that be rollin Mercedes
Getting freaky and
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)
