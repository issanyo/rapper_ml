[Verse 1: Tung Twista]
Relaxin', maxin' to the maximum
To tracks a hum, the wicks where the stacks are from
Inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz
What a miracle is, get down to spiritual business
Now my tounge kissed
Put words in your system, wished 'em
Respect the blackness 'em
Give in them, win them, the peace they want
But don't want the peace sign unless it's in the mind
Become a victim because I kick them, sick them
Supposed to be black but they be wack
Those who pretend to be a muslim - I gooshed 'em
Positive ones - I pushed 'em
Into the path of righteousness, might get dissed
Those who pump a fist but ain't right with this
I increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
If it ain't real stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus]
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart

[Verse 2: Tung Twista]
Terror wished 'em, I'ma terrorize elorize in disguise
Those false sabotagin' and I begin
To creepin' seepin' thought out unrighteousness and dissed
Connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
Figured they manifestin' G I can address
Individually each MC is throwin' up peace but don't pray to the east
I recollect the soul should be playin' towards Mecca
But snakes and devils won't let you
Freestyle some religous free dump see
To let you know how come dumb some be
Ignorance a commence to look like a fish
And since we whipped from bars to a ghetto pris
I'ma wiz some brains I give 'em a brain washin'
When I'm walkin' devils I'm squashin'
Science fiction mixed in, tricks in, fixin'
The ways of all sort for good
Come in my fortress I'm gonna force this
'Cause it's holy don't try to fold me
Some just say peace tryin' to be black guy
Some say peace thinkin' it means bye bye
So G if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus]
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart

[Verse 3: Tung Twista]
Let's walk the path of a vocabulary
You'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man
Let's fight this plan of a other man
Waxin' thoughts of a brother man
Satan's waitin' for us to be hatin' each other
Sister brother or mother, color
Blackness don't try to attack this, fact this, let's now practice
True peace new salon one who is a peace
Cease when you see hunger than give a peace
Blacks a supplied them and applied them, identified them
You suffer inhale and say why them
'Cause you did not follow the path that I layed out
Say blackness and get played out
Like children wieldin' some try to kick a fist
Pick a fist and I take a piss, wickedness to get crushed up
Movin' up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop
So you must stop
Fakin' the holy faith in wakin'
Star don't come apart, our hearts get a stake in
So don't be mad so what minds to the minimum
'Cause in then a man sendin' 'em holy wisdom
To let you know if it ain't from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus]
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
Don't give him no peace sign if you don't mean it from your heart
United we can get over, yet we're still apart
