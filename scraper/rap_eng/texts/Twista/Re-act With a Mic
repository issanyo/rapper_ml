[Dres:] Chi-town and my town
[Twista:] No doubt
[Dres:] A-yo, yo
[Dres:]
Yo ring the bell or watch me swell a bigga nigga, baby pa
Upon the passages the man with massive repertoire
The New York undercover Tri-borough representative
Be ever thorough in takin' niggas out like the editor
I put it down pickin' it up to get ya open
I'm the lesson niggas testin' be like destined
To be broken down, like matter
A fact I pimp it fatter than them
Or any other nigga talkin' that I be wack
Come now, son how the fuck you thought I would avoid
Fuck that star shit, niggas get their ass-teroid
My motion opens eyes like the coast and I co-host
Your roast, smokin' fuckin' phills with your coast, bitch
I put clowns in big shoes on the stage
You niggas don't know, had better vibe like a page
Don't switch and watch me catch you like no other can
Dres bitch I'm in the fuckin' house like Bruh Man, and yo
[Dres, Twista:]
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile, we geek and seek style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
[Twista:]
I embrace the mic like a axe when I hear tracks
React on victims with vengeance, hostile is my attack
A spittin' image of death when it comes to microphone battles
Illustrate fate with hate, creepin' on M.C.'s like shadows
Murder provokin' mics I'm smokin' like fat weed all day
No concept 'cause I be fresh from out that town called K
M.C. death increases, cut 'er up so you can pick up the pieces
Kill off more sissies than Spacek without telekinesis
Lethal as sayin' Mxyzptlk backwards when I wreck track
I come exact to pressure punks, pain for brains I extract
Intrude M.C.'s fears, think I'm the night creep like the black sheep
Attacks will equalize coats cold rappers stoled from back seat
The mack is sweet when pimpin' stages
Punks that think they can can next to me
Step and see, I bring out ecstasy through complexity
Textin' me can't out-shoot this here
Misfits get bloody like Prom Night
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
[Twista, Dres:]
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista rippin' shit so motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch a gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
[Dres:]
Yo what can you do, I stand out like a clue
With a twist I dissed the motherfuckers knowin' the taste of my piss
[Twista:]
Face to my fist disconnect necks with my checks and tape decks
Drop rappers off my skill's apex and caught tryin' to make threats
[Dres:]
Nigga-ro please, nigga freeze, nigga get on your knees
And get killed son, I serve a billion like the Mick-a-dees
[Twista:]
Be no fifty degrees I freeze M.C.'s bust three to the chest
Put teeth to the test, I kill on ship like B to the X
[Dres:]
Yo, swingin' like nunchucks, I'm rippin' up stupid fucks in a tux
I back, flip spin and kick a style that's deluxe
[Twista:]
So what's up, I react on niggas like Jason on blow
Blood's wasting on clothes from shanking with flows and splittin' through foes
[Dres:]
See, niggas got a suicidal tendency
Talkin' all that battle shit and we like splendid, B
But, keep that flavor, 'cause I got than that I gave ya
Me and my neighbor at your funeral with party favors
[Twista:]
Huh, the Twista splits heads like a divorce wit' no remorse
Wild as claustrophobics in closets when I bring the Porsche
With galactic tactics I max it, unless a convict when I honk it
M.C.'s from separate cities on some bomb shit, word
[Twista, Dres:]
Fuck a pistol, I'm killin' punks wit' shit that I write
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Dres and Twista watchin' sucker motherfuckers take flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Like a missile we got you seekin' style that takes flight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
Catch the gist of the niggas down to set it tonight
It's like a fight when I react with a mic
[Twista and Dres talking:]
Yeah, no doubt representin' out of New York I represent like a delegate
Speedknot Mobstaz, Campaign Click you know what I'm sayin'
Straight from the Chi
Queens what's goin' on, Brooklyn, Bronx, Staten Island
And peace out to K-town, peace out to Fish City
Long Island, the brother Mista Lawnge
Yo Lord C that brother got it goin' strong
Terrorizin' from terror town makin' sucker M.C.'s stay down
My brother Steve O, J.R. yo pop
Peace to all the 'hoods
