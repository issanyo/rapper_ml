[Intro: Young Nero]
Let it ride, now
Let it ride, now
Let it ride, let it ride, now
Let ride now

[Verse 1: Young Nero]
Just got off the phone with my lady, talkin' 'bout [?] like Hades
On child support for my baby
Plus loyal bills on my late fees
I need a quick lick, i need a same G
Need fat knots, about 80
So im on the phone with my man's now tryin' to cop a plan now
Im coming up on some bands now
Im trying to feed my fam now
Im sick and tired of surviving, im thirsy and [?] throbbin'
So im kicking doors, fuck knocking
Packing pistols, we poppin'
Running through hoods and mobbin'
Can you picture that without [?]?
Cause it's either this or we serve packs
Wanna be at the crib, like where the work at?
Knowing what im doing is just right
But my baby girl been crying every night
No food, no shoes, looking at me like daddy what you gon' do?
Never loved this life of mine, then again was forced to a life of crime

[Hook: Young Nero]
Im searching tired of hurting for my next dime
No matter how dark the times are, i gotta shine
Im tired of hustling, tired of the grind
A better life awaits me thats what i know
I see a light at the end of this long road
I keep on grindin', my vision never blinding
I know my time will come, so I ain't worried 'bout the timing

[Verse 2: Twista]
Got a call from the homie going through some drama wondering if i can pick him up
Tell me he was hurting and was searching for some dollars and a way to get them up
And he said he got the fully and he searching for a victim so we can go and stick him up
I can see it in his eyes, if you don't give him money I can tell he gon' him 'em up
Sick of being broke, ready to get the notes, put a 1 in front of the 0
Ready to be in the category of a baller, so its fuck everybody he knows
Coming up on the streets and i was offering cause i didn't have a young hero
Then i realized it was a type of environment that created Young Nero
Hopping on the passenger side of his ride we both ready to shoot
He was doing what he gotta do to get money for his daughter and so he can get a coo' swoop
On the end he feels hes a vicim cause he fells he gotta get it
Tell him he dont he say he ain't - with it - it's my - life and - how I - live it - so just - give it
Then i tried to tell him "listen to my talk, my walk, my mic, my fight, my hope, my life, my words"
Then he told me "you don't know my talk, my walk, my mic, my fight, my hope, my life, my words"
Laying everybody down is the only way he could find 'em
If it ain't robbery, it ain't worth grindin'
And i feel right now is a perfect time

[Hook: Young Nero]
Im searching tired of hurting for my next dime

Im tired of hustling, tired of the grind
A better life awaits me thats what i know

I know my time will come, so I ain't worried 'bout the timing

[Verse 3: Young Nero]
So i guess things changed up
Got my pocket change up
Put my girl in a new [?] truck
Might've said fuck you pay up
Income went from five to seven figures
Fuck boys still hating on how I'm living
Did it bigger than they ever did it
Old heads in the hood won't forget it
Finally put my baby through private school
And the makers is sitting on piles too
Running through the streets with savages
Thats a choice i made to see lavish shit
[?] and my stap tucked
Bundles of racks just wrapped up
Got a Benz from those [?] niggas
Made a few mil from a couple dollars
Got five racks up on my collar
Gonna be a hustler, not a scholar
[?] he's finna black out
Hungry for the cash so we ridin' in a 'lac now
Riding around with a MAC out while i spaz out
Click-clack-pow, no hit back more racks now

[Hook: Young Nero]
