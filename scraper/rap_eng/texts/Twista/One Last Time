[Verse 1]
You don't want to see these murder guys
Princess cuts hurt your eyes
Got the chicks that work them thighs
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Burglarize hoes
Leave your eyes closed
Bricks in my trunk while I ride slow
Smoke your fire dro
No repercussions
He was disgusting
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If them people come rushing
Can't say I froze
Won't open the doors
By the time they caught up
I done disposed of my outer clothes
Car in the garage
I say good god
My day was hard
Call two freaks up for the ménage à trois
Parlaying was hard
Sade was suave
When we was screwing
Sheets was ruined
If beef is brewing
I'm a put slugs deep into him
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards for hatin'
Master my patience
Them custom wood grain caskets is waitin'
Passion for Satan
They must have
Gave them a blood bath
Had to show them who really holding shit down with they tough ass
We alias
They wishing they be us
Can't three-eighty us
Cause we will wreck everything within a ten block radius
When you see me better speak with love
Or leak some blood
I got connections with all type of BM, chiefs and govs
Deeply plugged who got to retire from crime
About to hit that big lick
So we gonna pull it

[Hook]
Hit 'em in the body and the dome
Left the after party with the chrome
Come up with a milly
And as soon as everybody know that I'm gone
Gotta keep it Gangsta'
Cause I'm a hustla'
Do it like a balla'
Cause I'm a mobsta'

[Verse 2]
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection to cop me a brick
And he sent a Czechoslovakian chick
She was acting cocky and shit
She like watching blow at the hotel
With big dreams to never stop being rich
And she wasn't too sloppy with dick
Said when she get on she gonna cop me a six
Platinum blue Sprewell shoes
Detail smooth
On some Mickey and Mallory me and my female cruise
Type of demo what's the bi-no
I Gave her two-six plus ten-four
That's twelve-five for the brick
And five-hundred for the plane and limo
Plain and simple
Call my guy told him thanks and send more
Meditating plot on my lick when I smell them frankincense blow
Do my thugdizzle
I ain't scared of this
Fly your head like Pegasus
Bloody up that necklace
Hope I'm an arrow ?
Them terrorist
Fucked up the lick when sending chicks on the plane
Put a major glitch in the game
But I'm a get me them thangs
As I come with new ways to travel watch my shorties get on them
Coming back with pounds and packages with the scorpions on them
Of course we been on them
Niggas know they two for forty and want them
I done seen truck loads with more keys than accordions on them
And you think I'm a pass up
That quick fast dust
Let me mask up
That ain't a fast truck
Get your ass stuffed

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I spit words that be gangster shit
Make hustlers tip and ballers rich
Haters sick, mobsters hit
I'm the shit
You can see me visit the optometrist
Cars I flip
Unorthodox like Doctor Bonovich
Prada lick
But a nigga got whooped
Should have seen shit was funny
My own connection he got reason to gun me
I know he took the money
Even if I probably wrong
Turn down the volume
Shoot him on plastic to lay his body on
Fucking maricón
Two to the cabeza
Pinche puto
That ring on your pinky was too cold
Got pinch for two O's
And a half a brick
My staff is sick
Had him confess like a catholic
Always thought things was funny now you don't laugh at shit
Stupid bastard bitch
Never fuck with Twista, Turtle Banxx and Stokes
Coming up dro flowing slanging dope
I tried to chill
But when I see a lick to make the world mine
ON the love
I think I got to pull it

[Hook]
