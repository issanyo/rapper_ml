Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Ahh
Back again motherfuckers
Twista, Traxster, ahh

[Verse: Twista]
Come peep a legend and a boss burn one
Floss words, rappers that can break me off, heard none
I'm droppin' crack until the crosswords come
Got the thirty but I spit it like a Mossberg pump
If you give me trouble you see me deploy
Lyrics so butter you think I'm W.E.B. Du Bois
If you see me pull up in the bubble you greet me with noise
Keep your poise, but really you wanna see me destroyed
Acronym for me is D.O.C., I'm the O.G
Destroyin' all competition that's in my way because I'm G-O-D
You amount to nothin' if in my circumference or area
The Sagittarius in the Age of Aquarius
You act like you ain't know the veteran can go
And I be killin' them, in some instances better than befo'
Then I got ahh, crooked letter to the O
Severin' your throat, now they like "Who let him in the do'?"
No matter how you Google it then doodle it
What'll really make you the shit is how I see you make use of it
Crucifix and holy water won't stop the way he get
So crazy and sick, evil like I took a sip of Damian's fifth
Off Canadian's mist, Arabian piss, a Ukranian's fist
Spit so nice they be like "It's an alien's gift"
You pay me in bricks and I'mma show you a way we can flip
Or I'm clappin' like "What Happened to That Boy" like Baby and Clipse
Come talkin' shit 'bout what you do I'll bet you be the first
That might come up missin', I'll make sure that you don't need a hearse
I'm on a mission, don't come through unless you bring in work
I'm dissin', ammunition I'mma shoot until my fingers hurt
Then I'mma shoot some more if I can squeeze
'Cause you borin' while I'm soarin' like I'm Thor or Socrates
War as I conceive that the breath of horror I can breathe
Even though you servin' defense I be scorin', droppin' threes
All in my grill-y like you can throw them thangs
I'm insane while you prefer Novocain over pain
For talkin' shit tonight my bitch'll blow your brains
'Cause he thought the weakness was kryptonite, it was Lois Lane
I boss you like a parent apparently darin' ya
Scarin' ya if you're there when I get to airin' the derringer
The mini-carrier that's knockin' down your barrier
Bury ya, expose 'em like I threw a flare in your area
Carry your body off to the woods and get rid of it
You're rottin' while I go get some pot and then take a hit of it
Then I'mma try to come up with some different shit
While I'm draggin', like if rap was a dragon I am the spit of it
Twista
