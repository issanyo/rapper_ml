[Verse 1]
Dead on arrival, swear to God I'mma kill 'em
As if I done put my hands on the Bible
Get 'em cause I'm liable to rock a motherfucker off
Especially if I get my hands on a rifle
Do the damn thang, not that they can stop a nigga
Pop a nigga off as if you were champagne
Put 'em in the ambulance but ain't no resuscitation
Cause he done got knocked off, point-blank range
It's a crisis the way niggas will pull up and shoot
Last week, the streets just put him in a coupe
This week, the streets just put him in a suit
Six feet under with dirt on top of the roof
Put 'em in a grave, people standin' over your body
And they wonderin' if your soul'll be saved
Or if it has risen or if it will be forbidden, by the way
You was doin' shit, they could've put you in prison
Now you ain't with the livin'
Cause you weren't a shooter or didn't know how to shoot
Either way feel inferior, I make the block cripple
Comin' like a moshpit'll be the nigga knowin' if we
Bustin' Glocks, it'll put you up in a hospital
And when you on the way
And they get a look at the way that the bullets spray
Everybody about to know, that we don't play
Makin' sure that your body arrive D.O.A
Or dead on arrival...

[Verse 2]
Dead on arrival, soul all up on the block
I put some shots up in the head of a rival
Gun up on the passenger side of the vehicle, he hit you
With the artillery simply cause he didn't like you
Should've knew not to piss him off
Catch a disease of a gun cause it'll cough
Better watch your mouth if you see some grown folks
About higher pedigree, especially if it be a boss
These lil' niggas ain't playin'
Soon as you come up and start talkin' shit, then they sprayin'
[?Want you to ride in the whip, then they stand?]
Soon as they see the nigga hit, then they ran
Straight got ghost, they don't wanna [?] a nigga
That comin' at 'em ambitiously with the toast
Point-blank range if you let 'em too close
Scene of a homicide, body was lookin' gross
Prob'ly off with your head, if him in the scene
Was comin' to the war cryin' soft like [?]
And this ain't no Walking Dead, they get rid of you
If they dumped a body and a white chump might talk
No talkin' to the Feds,  they hit 'em fast
Try to retaliate, but they gon' get his ass
And they ain't gon' be able to revive him in the ambulance
They just gon' pick him up and zip him in a bag
Dead on arrival
