(chorus)
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
REPEAT

(verse 1)
Play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move
I was the wrong damn dude
Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical
My brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues
You snooze and lose
So what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes
And it was all on the news
See I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed
And it wasn't gonna be me
So what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent 3
No women no kids
And I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo
You think he stopped and load
He jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope
But he didn't have to be so bold
He rushed the Mob like a blob with the Glocks and more
And even called the cops on Sko
He be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat
The medallion to match with the rope
No cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride
Lookin' like a star when he glide
I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky
He be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide
Kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind
Purple Navigator and a Benz
A new ??, the old niggas that he used to fuck with
Took a fall for strength of a man

(verse 2)
(Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah
Pray to Allah, undo Allah
Anythang go wrong I pray to Allah
Anythang go right I give my praise to Allah
Anythang in sight I'ma bless for Allah
Everythang tonight I'ma test for Allah
Everythang you write I'ma erase yo bar
If you ridin' tonight you better hop out yo car
Cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star
I feel for ? my sisters at the bar
Y'all be aight just keep yo self to yo self
Y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare
Over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind
Still blind to the times and the signs
On the streets niggas killin' elites
Killin' ???
Killin' the chief
5 stars in the governor
Everybody gettin' covered up
Wrapped up in some bloody sheets
I came off the deep saw throw my heart
Niggas slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time
Since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now
Than to be waitin' in line

(chorus)

(verse 3)
I can't seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down
And I can't seem to get away from all the pressures
And the pain that I find myself around
But I need a little more time for me to survive
All the dirty things that I did in my life
I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run
But I cannot hide from my piece of mind
I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures
He was getting carried away because I let him slide
A couple times he went off on an adventure
Bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside
And god I like to for killin over some Benjamins
But it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride
He had to run to the van he was defending it
In a line of duty he died for a piece of mind
I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker
I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace
I could (?) hit me and my brother
We was the reason for a record that cd release
We B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time
You can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride
And motherfuckers got down cause never could
Never survive with the goods that god provide
So as I bogus wack him for doing my job
Eliminate niggas that hate cause they ruining the mob
I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad
While they flossing the cars we busting and turn into god

(chorus)
