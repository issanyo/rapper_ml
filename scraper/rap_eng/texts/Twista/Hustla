Chorus
Break it down slow, Take it down ohh
Said I'm a hustla by any means boy I don't play
If they don't give me what I wants I goes the other way
I'm ridin dirty, dirty im ridin swore to god I'ma ball each day
So come prepared I ain't neva scared they gone let my sources bank

Yea!

I got whatever you want I got whatever you need I'm a hustla from the Chi I can flip that
Billion dolla niggas with the billion dolla looks when them niggas got kush in the Midwest
Used to be able to come up off it
Used to be able to get the elbow for the 6 now mother fuckers want 8 (shit)
I'm supposed to honor the number but I know a nigga who a killa who don't give a damn might just
Come at you for the connect or I'ma have to do you in cause you chargin me middle man prices
I remember when we used to break a bitch now it's a recession we got to wait for the lick
For the kush they want 6 for the ounce (what?), and they want 28 for the brick
Now how the fuck am I gonna get rid of these them two I'm hopin them go soon
Dude said he can't cop em I want too much and I ain't leavin him no room
I gotta get it how I gotta get it even if I'm breakin down (dope) Break it down (slow) Take it down (oh)

Rollin with a pistol and a double aluminum room at the Ramada getting down in the streets
Hustlin hard takin what you can get , but you steady reminiscing on 50,000 a week
A playa mode is about how to look good and different methods on how to cut that hoe
Hustle mode is if the cocaine cook good and different methods on how to cut that dough
Had to pop at a nigga because it used to be cool you trusted him and now you gotta go to court
Cause he gave you the money and when he drove off he called you and told you he was short
That's some shit that could've got dude killed listen to it when the rap tunes real
Put the bitch on the plane with a couple of pounds that you can't smell cause its vaccum sealed
Take off a quarter then smoke in order they choke I cut it open they collapse from the scent
Pop it all off for 600 an ounce I'm get to smoke for free and get back what I spent
I gotta get it how I gotta get it even if I?m breakin down (dope) Break it down (slow) Take it down (oh)
