[Hook - Havoc]
Keep those eyes open, gotta keep them open
Need a higher dosage
Something just a little more potent
My eyes open, gotta keep them open
Need a higher dosage
Something just a little more potent
Eyes open, gotta keep them open
Need a higher dosage
Something just a little more potent
My eyes open, gotta keep them open
Need a higher dosage
Something just a little more potent

[Verse 1 - Havoc]
On the gas, ain't lookin' back
Can't forget where I came from
Same mistakes that's madness
Ya end up back in them same slums
Day one my eyes was on that prize that I sized up
? chick after ? chick, I vow never to wife her
Cold cash, cutey pies scheming on where that jewelry lay
Bad fuck behind that mask, bitch might have that pookie face
I earned this and I be down, forfeit to a reround(?)
I let you in and you bit that hand, nigga that's outright treason
Eyes out for that mischief, fuck that, fill clips
To the top, real rap, know that I just built this
Sweat blood and tears, my brother died was the only time
I shed tears then switched gears, was outta there like last year
Now everything is smooth like cashmere, chinchilla
Goose so white that's Mac Miller, feel some kinda way then blast nigga
Word me, that's a good one, fear none, heirdom
'Round here ain't no fair ones, you not shootin' off no flare guns

[Verse 2 - Twista]
Ah, I say damn, Ama chaos, havoc and mayhem
To be in the streets you gotta be a brave man
Talk about cha comin' up  and do the main band
Cause there ain't telling what these motherfuckas will do
Be prepared in case anybody fuck with the crew
They was in the club watching  when you was in V.I.P
Throwing hundreds around like money ain't nothing to you (damn)
They be the ones to fall back
Up in the cut and probably in all black
Mean-muggin' motherfuckas and they all strapped
Lookin' when you was acting like you was all that (what)
Acting like you untouchable cause you tippin'
'Til they catch you slippin', and then what you thought you seen?
Better be on top of your shit when you walkin' through the shots
Same demo  when you walk through Queens
Shorty like I doubt that, I got things and I'm 'bout that
This hood life what it look like, body snatched up still ain't found that (damn)
The game as ever it's cold or vice-versa depending on the way you see so
Learn when to check your ego, watch your people
Money is evil when you better keep yo...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Havoc]
With me or against me cause there ain't no in between
Don't walk around fearing no man cause they bleed just like me
I represent that bad block, our mascot is that real dope
Come around with that fuckery and get stomped out with them steel toes
Mopped up on that sidewalk and you tongue kissin' that curb
Taking turns whippin' that ass, we don't give respect, that's earned
And to whom it may concern, got a problem? be my guest
We don't play fair but you will cause you not cheatin' no death around here

[Hook]
