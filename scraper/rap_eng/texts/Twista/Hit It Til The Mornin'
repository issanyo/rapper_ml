[R. Kelly]
Ladies, it's your boyfriend, I hope ya'll like to do it, like I like to do it

[Hook]

Till the sun comes up
(Oh yeah)
Yo can I hit it till the morning?
(You know it's going down)
I'll be sexing you up
(Chicago's finest)
Until the sun goes down

We ride, get high, hit clubs
(Oh we pull it down like this)
We ball, we bad [2x]

[Twista]
What you know about the Mobster Elites, Crucial Conflict and them Do or Die flows
What you know about Kellz & Twist- two multi-platinum artists stepping out the suicide doors
I ain't claiming the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while I tell you bout the ground I be on- Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her staring at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm about to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass ho to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think I'm a make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a white-tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get em on
After dis one night, I'm a be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon
Pimp on

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
Hopping out the fattest cars that money can buy (can buy)
Chick on my side (on my side)
Step off up in the club, 708 repping the Chi (Chi)
I'm at the bar talking to this chic sipping on that magic potion
Trying to get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean
(Rub her down) with some heated lotion
(And now)got honey soaking
(She's ready) for the pipe
(Fucking with) her emotions
Wanna show you what a true playa's like, you would swear you was in paradise
Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys
Girl if you ride out wit me I promise you won't regret it
I shoot hoop and so you know this boy is real athletic
You want me to go down on you baby don't even sweat it
Just pass the Remy to me and watch me get real nasty
R's gonna give it to you how you like it, I'll be bumping on that

[Hook]

[N.A.R.D]
Yo Kellz, take another sip, then another trip buy another fifth (now another bad bitch want me)
Grab another clip, hit it like the trip, represent the pimps (still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie
Churh right here, muthafucka can't clone me
Louis Vitton, Gucci and Prada, hit it from the back and make her girlfriend hollar
Pimperish but he walk like a scholar, Stack the paper like the almighty dollar
I'm a make it do what it do, you dig?

[Belo Zero]
Well it gotta be (hoes) gotta be (dog) gotta be (dro) gotta be (well) gotta be (club) gotta be (shy) gotta be (long) gotta be (dance)
I was out West at the circle when I met this woman
She was dark-skinned had a shape like a mountain so I know she ain't frying
Put that ass in the back of the jeep and I know she's coming
Says Belo when her toes curl up when I know she's cumming
They supposed to be cumming
I can give you what you want like some dick for days
Belo be a nimpho girl, and I can kiss you where you wanna sex you 3-4 ways
Like ya lips, cheeks, arms, back, middle place
But I gotta stay true cause I'm a realist so I gets paid
Do or Die and Kell

[Hook 2x]
