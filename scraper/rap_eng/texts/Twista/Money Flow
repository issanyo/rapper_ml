[Featuring Tung Twista]

Now for some typical reason

I'm rollin up some hoes and pattin my back seat hah

My pimpin lyrical tactics is like a dirty kid flippin on a mattress

Now flex this

Verse One: Tung Twista
Now I just be

On the front porch with a torch ready to scorch

Two women peepin me cause really I'm gone

In the zone they havin thoughts of freakin me

Keepin me company bumpin me for the privacy I'm on

They can see I'm a cool muhfucka kickin the petty

Down with a tango on my razor fade

Peanut butter complexion to silly processions

Of bitties a fifty sack got some reefers and a razor blade

Like a game of Spades, crack the bullshit

These days was made for me to devise strictly games that paid

Women freakin me greedy lickin me doin body graffiti

Throwin they panties up on the stage, are you up on the age?

Two players in the Chi, you're thinkin Do Or Die

You and I can be naked cause I'm the love that you've been thinkin of

The style of flow is a vocal calico

To show you with the mic I be speakin love, what's the words, weak and

Numb

Go to my crib, no need to bring a mask and Glock

Try not to pass the block, gettin more hot than the astronauts

Sippin After Shock

I ball cause I see you all on Rap-a-Lot

Let's get parley and then crack the spot

Plenty Henny for my crew and I ain't even broke up half a knot

Keep on holdin me while I roll to be we can smoke or ride

And you can play with me to keep the passion hot

Don't you know how the money flow

Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow

Verse Two: Belo
Mmmm, now they peep a brother Rolex

Try and get race car, heavy on the skin tech

Money clean like Windex

Givin up the ave like a brother gonna pass, but the hoe check

Hoe flex I'm on the avenue, lay it back sip a half a brew

So I see if I can have a fruit

A peep show like the hoe when she thinkin bout me havin you

She laughin too, and pass a few, beads around

Smokin trees till the leaves come down

She be clothed ain't a skeezer now, show em the paper

That be caught up at your crib with your pantses down

But money maker want a triple take

Look at the nigga with the endless dividends of heavyweight

See him ridin in the see-A, D-I, double-L, A-see

Always checkin paper in tall ways

Pull em off the sprawlways

Herd a couple hoes in clothes and I'm supposed to be all day

Parley parley, dog that's how the money flow

Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O

Don't you know

Verse Three: AK-47
Bend the block with the indo, blowin out my window

Rolex on my side do', lean back in the slow flow

Gettin paid as the night go

I see some fly hoe, tell me where you crib at

Where's the place that you live at?

Hit you on the phone till you be all alone

So we can get it on baby just kick back

Swiggin brews and Perrier

Thick chick with a booty like a plizayer do

AK (to where) to the pen

And to tell all my niggas to keep it strong

They ain't got long (to what) to see

Where the niggas is kick it where a nigga kick it

Go where I go Cadillac to the show

Po Pimp fuck the dough hit the stage and become wicked

Get the money and ride out, go back to the hideout

Take a woman to the bed and spread them thighs out

I'ma pull my surprise out

Then my boys was flyin out, but two girls were chasin

Deep in Chicago, been doin this since the nine-oh

Comin up put a number on fryin hoes

Let the money flow

Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O

Verse Four: Nard
Now for some typical reason I'm rollin up with a hoe

And I'm pattin my back seat

I pimp lyrical tactics like a dirty kid flippin on a mat

Never could I come flexless, when I wreck shit

Then be dip through the Chi and enjoy my Lexus

Better blow when you bob your head, to the fed shit

Why you waitin for the next kid, motherfucker

Makin money just wanted to take a little get the dick wet

Get my girl in bed

Spend my money in the Southern, motherfuckers

That's thuggerin, but I'ma come from the heart for start

To stop all the niggas the bigger the trigger the larger the dividends

Pimpin and paperin leavin sugar in

Till money flow like a dreamland

But really though, could you tell me how the money flow?

Chorus:
Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O

Don't you know, how the money flow

Don't you know, how we do it in the 'O
