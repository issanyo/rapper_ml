[Intro]
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna bring–
You don't want– you don't– you don't–
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna bring–
You don't wanna bring– you don't– you don't–
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring– you don't wanna bring–
You don't wanna dark-darkness into this

[Verse 1: Dawreck]
Nigga got me fucked up thinking I'm a ho or
Something like I won't leave a nigga punch drunk
Run around talking all tough chump
Fuck around and end up getting stuffed up
Better believe it if a nigga threaten mine he fuck
Beat him up cause a nigga trying his luck
Heat him up while the nigga trying to duck
But when I line 'em up, I'mma be firing 'em up
Like 2 lines of dust, I'mma be too cock wit' it
Glock cock aim and ready to pop wit' it
Shots gon' ring, get ready to drop man
I ready done got aim, red dot that fitted
And if a nigga thinking that I'm kidding
I got a slug wit' ya name on it homie you can come get it
And you the nigga to blame cause you the one that did it
When nigga start shit 'Wreck the nigga that'll finish
Giving shots to the face like a dentist
I'm a menace and I'm making sure a motherfucker feel it
Soon as a nigga get into my business
Only got a couple seconds 'til his blood start spilling
Fuck y'all figured? Reckless I'm one of the coldest
Put a hole up in one of y'all bitches
Half y'all hoes, the other half snitches
Matter of fact fuck it, all of y'all get it
Leave no witness, you fucking wit' the motherfucking
Realest I be fucking wit' them killers
Them niggas on the blocks
With the Glocks steady ducking from the cops drug dealing
He be thinking that he hard, 'til I hit him
In his heart and his body fall apart like Syphilis
Cause he rolling wit' a squad but I'm rolling wit' a mob
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

[Hook: Twista & Dawreck]
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna be around when the reaper come
Nigga better stay up out the street when a nigga got beef
When you see me with the heat just run
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna get into it with a nigga that'll straight black out
Nigga you don't really wanna take that route
Fucking with a nigga that'll straight jap out
You don't wanna bring darkness into, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring– you don't wanna bring–
You don't wanna dark darkness into this

[Verse 2: Twista]
Gon' talk that shit now
Automatic shots at the enemy while I'm screaming out "Bitch die"
Should've wouldn't have to try to let your fists fly
Did you think that you would die while you was this high?
Did you think a street sweeper would make you look at the reaper then take a peek of the death of your soul when it got cold?
Did you think that you would ever just take a good look at the darkness out of a black hole when you got stoned?
See me hooded?
Semi-automatic for niggas thinking they hard to the fullest
I'mma put it on the on the mob, I'mma pull it
Hollow points up into the chest and watch him slob on the bullet
Or choking on the blood
Tried to get at it before me but I was quicker I cut him open with a slug, on his shoulder was the blood
A little bit of artillery out to the enemy just a token of my love
And I hope this boy a thug
See if he charges, see if he ain't a mark or see if he got the heart to do what he gotta do (to do what he gotta do)
Like he a G (like he a G)
You can forget about it
I'm off the chain like a fifth of Hennessy
Unlike the piff be when I see a [?] tip sweet
Let your lips speak, see the clip leak
When I flick heat, leave a motherfucker up shit's creek
Popped by one of the breeze, killed by one of the souls
Murdered by one of the folks and the vice lords
Talking shit you better be ready to fight for
Got something might get shot twice for
Me and my garage is infamous
You don't want to spark the emphasis
On the pistol I can make it pitch black in the room
You don't wanna bring darkness into this

[Hook: Twista & Dawreck]
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna be around when the reaper come
Nigga better stay up out the street when a nigga got beef
When you see me with the heat just run
You don't wanna bring darkness into this
You don't wanna get into it with a nigga that'll straight black out
Nigga you don't really wanna take that route
Fucking with a nigga that'll straight jap out
You don't wanna bring darkness into, darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring darkness into this, darkness into this
You don't wanna bring– you don't wanna bring–
You don't wanna dark darkness into this
