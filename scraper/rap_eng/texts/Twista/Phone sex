[Twista]
Now Twista and Syleena on tour
We can barely see each other
And you told me you ain't like that
But what if I can find a way
Where we can still be together
And get freaky, would you like that?
I know Im making you warm
I'm about to fuck you all night
And hit it until the morn
How I do it keep you wet
Under the mystical storm
Even though I ain't gon' be there
In the physical form
'Cause I, lick anyway you want
Freaky nigga from the hood
Do ya good while I rub your body
Move your head towards me
So that I can get up in you from the back
While I scream, ooh shawty
I could snatch you up out that thong
Let's get it on as many times as you want
Now visualize that it's me while you touch yourself
Can you feel me cummin' through the phone?

[Syleena/Verse 1]
I'm waiting in the living room
Drinking Alize' ready for you
To touch me soft, rub me strong, get me wet
Love me long but wait a minute
I need you to
(Take all your clothes off)
I want you to
(Come in here and set it off)
From the floor to the bed
Baby tell me are feeling me yet
(On this phone sex)

[Chorus/Syleena]
Breathing hard while I touch myself
(On this phone sex)
Gotta do it 'cause I'm by myself
(On this phone sex)
You're not here but I feel you babe
(On this phone sex)
And all you gotta do is scream my name
(On this phone sex)
Getting hotter by the minute, babe
(On this phone sex)
Got me reaching for my rabbit, babe
(On this phone sex)
But I'm frontin' 'cause I know babe
(Baby)
It ain't nothin' like the real thing


[Syleena/Verse 2]
Can you see me in a red thong
Red pump heals nothing else on
Oil on my legs, cherry red lips
Black hair straight, covering my breasts
Would you like that? How 'bout I?
(Do a little strip tease)
Then you can
(Take advantage of me)
Anything you want me to be
Baby, I can be your fantasy
(On this phone sex)

[Chorus/Syleena]
Breathing hard while I touch myself
(On this phone sex)
Gotta do it 'cause I'm by myself
(On this phone sex)
You're not here but I feel you babe
(On this phone sex)
And all you gotta do is scream my name
(On this phone sex)
Getting hotter by the minute, babe
(On this phone sex)
Got me reaching for my rabbit, babe
(On this phone sex)
But I'm frontin' 'cause I know babe
(Baby)
It ain't nothin' like the real thing

AAAH!
Are you there?

[Syleena/Verse 3]
Imagine me on the top of the bed
On my hands and knees saying
"Come here, daddy, come on and get in"
Talk dirty to me, tell me how it feels
(Baby)
Fast or slow , tell me, what you wanna do to me?
Ooh, you feel so good, keep it right there
I'm about to climax
(On this phone sex)

[Chorus/Syleena]
Breathing hard while I touch myself
Gotta do it 'cause I'm by myself
(On this phone sex)
You're not here but I feel you babe
(On this phone sex)
And all you gotta do is scream my name
(On this phone sex)
Getting hotter by the minute, babe
(On this phone sex)
Got me reaching for my rabbit, babe
(On this phone sex)
But I'm frontin' 'cause I know babe
(Baby)
It ain't nothin' like the real thing
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ooo, ahh, ahh
