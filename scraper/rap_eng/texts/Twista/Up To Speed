[Hook x2]
Twista been comin with fast lyrics for years
I'm glad to see niggas catch up to speed
But when it come to doin a intricate pattern
I bet you y'all can never fuck with me
’Cause when it come to this music
I am a mobster, I am a chief
And when it come to this rap shit
Then I am a monster, I am a beast

[Verse 1]
Never let negative energy interfere with this
I be from the Outer Limits and I devour timid
Haters that attempt to annihilate what I put together
They don't wanna do when I got the mind of a military
And they wanna question if I am a lyricist
I will murder 'em with the dialect of an apostle
I'm apocalyptic and I can kick it whichever way you wanna hear it
Ain't no telling who I’mma kill and bury
How could you fuck with a nigga willin to kill 'em all
With the ability to body a brigade of motherfuckers
That come with the ruckus to you and any anatomy
Whoever strategy you will try to initiate
Theoretically I'm deciphered as infinite
In other words I'm immortal, I came through a portal
And one day I’mma go back and tell 'em how them niggas all hate on me
’Cause I kept a circle and will not affiliate
Ain't an impossible, never, I go the whole yard
In the law of my continuum, my minimum
Is forever and ever, so nigga, whatever you wanna do
It don't really matter to me, let’s handle it right now
What happened to going and pull a nigga ho card
Fuck all the thugging on the internet ’cause I'm not into that
I'm on a higher intellect and I don't wanna catch a murder
’Cause I know that it's possible that you might die

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Now they be telling me Twista come with the hard shit
I don't wanna disappoint 'em so I gotta get it in
And kill 'em with every syllable after syllable
Like a gorilla do when I be the metaphysical
I be knowing the way I spit it be God's gift
’Cause I'm feeling so fab when I fuck a nigga up
It’s an immaculate conception of something immortal
And the proportion of the destruction is biblical
Like Isaiah, Deuteronomy, and Leviticus
I be a lyrical prophet, I'm a disciple with a rifle
And like John the Baptist, my raps is
A revelation of the genesis of your downfall
I'm a playa, you should follow me ’cause I'm infamous
And my flow is off the chain
I be rapping about something holy
Then I talk about your body being cut up in pieces
Out on the premises when they found y'all
You gotta give me the status of bein' a legend
In my continuum what I be givin' 'em, be killin' 'em
And everybody feelin' him, I'm colder than December
I'm a symbol and I make 'em remember my emblem
I hit you with the automatic and see you in heaven
Committed a verbal murder, we heard the surgery
Wasn't a success when you was in the hospital
So if I ever get charged, I hope that I'mma get the minimum

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x2]
Now there'll be no killing off Twista cause I'm the omnipotent
But most of them niggas just hate on me cause I flow different
Like the way that I spit a verse to get in a nigga ass
Intricate patterns of intelligently spoken words
Killin' my enemy off with the dialect of Chicago and I'mma blast
