Let's get up on the weekend, girl wassup with ya weekend
Late night, late night we can get it, go and kick it on a weekend
We can hit the club on a weekend, girl let's dug on a weekend
Take you back to the crib, we can both make love on a weekend

Baby girl, [?] weekend

[Verse 1: Twista]
You are over grind, you've been working all day and everyday And I can see you need a break because they got you working overtime
They done fell in love with your resume, and you don't ever hesitate
You do over forty hours a week, give your time and energy to the powers to be
Got you on the schedule, standing up on your feet
So on the weekend with you is where I wanna be, so now I'm gone forward
Loving the way you be taking it out the box, there's something to be shown for
I feel like you need a rest and a little me to relieve the stress, I think that's a little more important, girl don't act like it's nothing
This break can take us way across the park so we can break in I can take you to the top
Saturday is Sunday, I take you to get a shot
Loving it a lot better if I can't take you to the spot

What am I to do? All I can do is take you to eat when you got the day off of work cause I can see you always gotta lot to do
The city need her services on the weekdays, so she paid, but still you gotta take time to pamper yourself
You do some wrestling, have some fun and take care of your health
Find you somebody that you know that don't care about your wealth
Something telling me I feel like Iâ€™m the man that can help, so now I'm gone forward
I wanna get it with you at the end week and I'm hoping you ain't gon be doing nothing
We can be looking for somewhere to be
If you feeling lonely, cause I got the O.G
And I wanna give you booty loving, like I'm gon take a puff
And we can go anywhere that you want because I know you don't get out enough
I know you feeling like the workload be piling up
So I'ma see you about 4 times up out the month
