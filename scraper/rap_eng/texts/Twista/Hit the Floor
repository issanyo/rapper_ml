[Intro: Pitbull]
Yea, we gon' take it from the bottom to the Windy City
Miami's finest, Chi-Town's finest - Pitbull, Twista
And we want all the women to... Boogie boogie boogie (go 'head baby)
Boogie boogie boogie (go 'head baby)
Boogie boogie boogie
Boogie boogie boogie, boogie boogie boogie

[Hook]
Get down hit the flo {*4X*}
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir {*4X*}

[Twista]
Shake it shake it fo' me, come and work it fo' me
Shawty but don't break it fo' me; wiggle wiggle won't you
Come on and get naked fo' me; say you like the dick?
Won't you come and take it from me; gon' twirk it fo me
While I let the dick slide, pop it fo me' mama
Show me you know how to ride - now stop runnin from me
Go and hold that fatty up - now let me beat up
Until you say you've had enough - Pitbull and Twista shawty
Show me how you work that, work that
Got to the flo but dont hurt that, hurt that
Take you with me if you can show me how you do that
Looking so hot and got the hood hollin', "who dat"
Hit it so hard mamacita; come and let me inspect yo thigh
Open up because I got a new excercise
I can drop it down pick up the flow, hit that bitch up with the rythm and go
GET DOWN HIT THE FLO'

[Hook]

[Pitbull]
When Pit's in the area, area
Better check his bank fo direct deposits
Check under yo bed bed, check yo closet
She dont like bacon? (Cool, I'll give her sausage)
If it doesn't make sense, sense, don't make dollars, dollars
Don't make money, money, don't make profits
Boogie boogie - I just want to give you nook
Noogie noggie - turn around let me see how you would
Do me, do me; put it all together that would be a
Boogie Boogie noogie noogie noogie do me do me
Dammit woman; I'm on the track with Twista
So its only right that I take my words and twist 'em
Wacth how I get up and go, watch how I switch up the flo
Watch how I do it like, no ones done it befo'
Yes uuhhh Pits a pro, mami what you frontin' fo'
Girl do what you do best, HIT THE FLO!

[Hook]

[Twista]
All the chicks be lovin Twista when he spittin 'em rhymes
And I be lovin all the ladies that got dick on they mind
From the windy city down to the dirty south
Like Luda you know I beat that shit by the +Word of Mouf+
I sold 350 the first week
+The Day After+, I'm coming at you on a smurf beat
Becuase he got the base to hit you on the head like a 4 by 4
Now back it up for me I'm beggin shawty Por favor
Go and get tell other lane, lemme show you how to jack it
Ain't no like nothin a brother, you gon like it when I smack it
Got you in the fantasy, I hope no shit pop off
While we grindin and I'm trying to get my rocks off
Hope them haters dont coma at me thinking my blocks off
Cause we known to get the heaters burnin like hot sauce
Its all because I gave them baby mamas dick on the low
I tell em, "GET DOWN HIT DA FLO"

[Hook]
