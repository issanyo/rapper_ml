[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Red light, seeps in
Don’t let me in
She gon’ ride tonight
Ride, ride, ride
She gon’ ride tonight
Ride, ride, and I

[Verse 1: Supa Bwe]
How you only 20, got your money right, you lookin’ right
Every time we fuckin’ in the studio you do me right
Waitin’ on tonight, baby you my mood
Mood of my life, I’ll be there for you
This ain’t your first time
This ain’t your first time
This ain’t my first time
This ain’t my first time

[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Ride, ride, she gon’ ride tonight, ride
Ride, ride, she gon’ ride tonight, ride
Her skin on my skin, ahh
Red light, six Xan
Her skin on my skin, ahh
Red light, six Xan

[Verse 2: Supa Bwe]
Damn I love Aaliyah, wish I could see Aaliyah live
While she alive, I will always be Aaliyah hive
With Twista ridin’ by, sittin’ in the Phantom, damn
Blowing backwoods, bumpin’ all my latest jams

[Verse 3: Twista]
I know you’re thinking in your head how will it be when I ride him
Whenever we get  up on top of the bed, I wanna be on the bottom
Phenomenal body, I wanna get intimate
And I be lovin’ the way you be doin’ it how you doin’ it
Making me wanna scream, and I’ma holler
Instead of assuming that I wanna hit it from the back
Like to take advantage of me the way you want to do
Instead of missionary and dictionary and other positions I think my favorite one is up under you
I got my people tellin’ me how they remember you
How you was fly and so shy in ‘09
These days you can act a little devious
And social media got you thinkin’ you so fine
But I don’t mind ‘cause you be so dominant when you on top
Like give it to me ‘til it hurt now girl
Let me see you pull it up and drop it on me
Turn around and give it to me reverse cowgirl
To rack around and I be licking your neck
Rubbin’ your hair, kissing your lips while I be grippin’ them hips
‘Cause you the shit, and you’re so pretty
Rubbing your thighs, I look in your eyes while I’m sucking them titties
I just want to feel them nipples dangling down on top of me while you in control of how much you want to take
Hopefully it’ll be all of it, you got the power now I’m finna see which move you make
Ain’t nowhere for me to run, nowhere to escape
And you got me on lock once you got me inside
Ain’t no way that I can move when I’m
‘Cause she gon’

[Hook: Supa Bwe]
Ride, ride, she gon’ ride tonight, ride
Ride, ride, she gon’ ride tonight, ride
Whole time I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout ya
Whole time I been singing ‘bout ya
Whole time I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout ya
Whole time I been singing ‘bout ya
Her skin on my skin, ahh
Red light, six Xan
Her skin on my skin, ahh
Red light, six Xan
