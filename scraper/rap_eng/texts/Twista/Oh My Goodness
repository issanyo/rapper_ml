[Hook:]
Oh my goodness, that ol' booty
The way she shake it, do something to me
Oh my goodness, that ol' booty

I don't wanna get too know her better, better
That booty got me thinking bout some things, we could do later
I don't wanna get too know her better, better
That booty got me thinking bout some things, we could do later (Twista)

[Verse 1: Twista]
On the grind because this chick bad, from behind it'll make you spring quick cash
I ain't ever seen a honey so fine, with class, thick ass, it give a nigga whiplash
Booty so exotic, so strong, look at how she move her bottom to the song
And I, got a bottle of Patron, it's on, cause she wanna, watch me slide off the thong
Like oh my goodness, look at them goodies, she make it shake like banana pudding
Going so hard she give me a wooden, she got the fatty behind the cookie
I love the way you spread it when you dropping on the stage and you working on the pole
When it come to shaking it she ainâ€™t gon even play with it she gotta let me know

[Hook:]
Oh my goodness, that ol' booty
The way she shake it, do something to me
Oh my goodness, that ol' booty
The way she shake it, do something to me

I don't wanna get too know her better, better

[Verse 2: Twista]
Why yo booty so fat? Throw it all in and bring it back
Into my area here, look [?] every year, damn you got money coming out the crack
Cause you be looking different and your body so explicit, then they thinking get it
So them niggas tripping, and I know that they be tipping cause they thinking they can hit it
Shawty where did you get all that booty? Let me shoot that shit up like the Call of Duty
You keep looking at me like you all into me, come girl with me and let's make a movie
I see the way you pop that thang, it's making you popular so they drop that change
I can take you to the top let's hang, and I walk up behind you so I can watch that thang

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Twista]
