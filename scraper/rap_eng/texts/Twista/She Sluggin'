(Verse)
Got to love her when I'm looking at her butt
She got me fucked up
Ass like that where I from
They call it a dump trump
Now we just say she sluggin'
When she dancing got me bugging
Then Shawty got ticked all of a sudden
Look how them jeans hugging
Look at the figure she think she ate cornbread
When you was a shawty you must've been breastfed
Yeah my mother the whole package
Look at the face,ass,chest,legs
Imma holla out, I'm on duty
I don't give a fuck
She y'all will sue me
She can either have an ego or not
Boujie
If I look 'cause she got a drop botty

(Chorus)
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it

(Verse)
Her body grown,let her pop it to the song
Not a model but in tone
She still got it going on
So fat, I fiend
Started busting to the scenes
I can't understand how you get
All that ass up in them jeans
Now make it drop, don't stop
With your booty my section
When you come in my direction
Looking good from the front
But when I look at your reflection
It's really what is filling my erection
In my own zone, we all own bones
She own, she be owns
We can go go home

(Chorus)
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it

(Verse)
Come and see me bragging on the hole
While her TB dragging on the draw
Talking about how she's so thick
That the fatty be dragging on the floor
Look at that ,I'm mean
She got everybody looking and I love it
When I hick her
She got cushing for the pushing
Milk it ,cook it, and nuke it
People like the way you lookin'
When she buggy
And I know that she can give me more
Notice all the counters
I'm on the fatty when I play hookie
Girl I don't mean no disrespect
And I know that you're inteligent in fact
But your booty hell a thing
Looking down Imma tell her that

(Chorus)
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She do it She do it
She sluggin' She sluggin'
She sluggin' She sluggin'
