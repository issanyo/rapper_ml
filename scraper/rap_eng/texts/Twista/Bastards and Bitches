(Twista Verse)
Bastards and Bitches, after my riches
I'm so spectacular with this now lets get back to the business..
I'm like Dracula with this, my vernacular's endless
Ask if it's fact or fictitious, but it's just the act of a menace..
Nigga this far from scary and I'm like a barbarian
Arian, air he inhalin' until I start to airin' 'em
So don't even start comparin' em, or I'mma just start to bury 'em
I'm darin' 'em, to come take a swim in the shark's aquarium
Lyric extortionist, turn you to carcasses, every portion is
Thoughts of a awkward vocal contortionist..
On my mom and them I'm better than them who copy my flow like a homonym..
And Amoxicillin will not stop the villain, it's pain I inflict when I'm bombin' 'em
God like I'm Andromedan, better yet Osiris or should I just say Asaar
Father of Heru, I told you that I was astonishing
Take a walk in my moccasin, I can send you through a journey of knowledge and horror
Sodom and Gomorrah, biblical verses as if I was reading the Torah

(Shawnna Verse)
Bastards and Bitches, after my riches
But I count my stacks and my digits like I was 10 mathematicians
You gon' slice your wristiphon, tights that go glistenin
Do what I can maestro with the brightest like nitroglycerin
My oral skill is a horrible chlorophyll
Hallucinogenic that you get so dumb like cannabis or a pill
Shawnna can do shit that be damagin'
Leavin' 'em standin' stiff as a mannequin
Burn a bitch up cause I'm hot
Pain I inflict cannot ever be cured with no Anacin
Rhetoric that I spit is like magic cause I am a sorcerer conjuring fortresses leaving the floor full of carcasses
Motherfuckers should fall for this
On the core with this, I am a beast, a hottie, bangin
Bodies with niggas
My hobby is triggas, so don't make me have to
Come up and shotty your nigga
