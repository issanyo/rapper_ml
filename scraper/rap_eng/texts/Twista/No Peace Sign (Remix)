[Verse 1: Tung Twista]
Relaxin', maxin' to the maximum
To tracks a hum, funky the wicks where the stacks are from
Inside the styles of a funky lyrical wiz
What a miracle is, get down to spiritual business
Now my tounge kissed
Put words in your system, wished 'em
Respect the blackness 'em
Give in them, win them, the peace they want
But don't want the peace sign unless it's in the mind
Become be a victim because I kick them, sick them
Supposed to be black but they be wack
Those who pretend to be a inspirational muslim - I gooshed 'em
Positive ones - I pushed 'em, and wisdom
Into the path of righteousness, might get dissed
Those who pump a fist but ain't right with this
I increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
If it ain't real stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus - D.J. Coolie Bee Scratches]
No peace sign [7x]

[Verse 2: Tung Twista]
Terror wished 'em, I'ma terrorize i think elorize in disguise
Those false sabotagin' and I been begin
To creepin' seepin' so thought out unrighteousness and i'm a dissed
Connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
Figured they manifestin' G I can address
Individually each MC y'all be throwin' up peace but never pray to the east
I recollect the soul should be playin' towards Mecca
But snakes and devils made i never touched her won't let you
Freestyle some religous free dump see
To let you brother know how come dumb some be
A stupid Ignorance a commence to look like a fish
And since we whipped from bars to a ghetto pris
I'ma wiz some brains I give 'em a lyrical brain washin'
When I'm walkin' devils I'm be squashin'
Science fiction better be mixed in, tricks in, better be fixin'
The ways of all sort for good
Come inside fortress I'm gonna force this
'Cause it's holy don't try to fold me
Some just say peace tryin' to be black guy
Some say peace thinkin' it means bye bye
So G if ya never mean this from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus - D.J. Coolie Bee Scratches]
No peace sign [7x]

[Verse 3: Tung Twista]
Let's walk the funky path of a vocabulary
Come in carry the holy thoughts of every righteous man
Let's fight this plan of a other man
Waxin' the funky thoughts of a brother man
Satan's waitin' for us to be hatin' every takin each other
Sister brother or mother, color
Blackness don't try to attack this, fact this, let's now practice
True peace new salon one who is a peace
Cease when you see hunger than give a peace
Blacks a supplied them and applied them, identified them
You suffer inhale and say why them
'Cause you never coming that follow the funky path that I layed out
Say blackness and get played out
Like children wieldin' some try to kick a fist
Pick a fist and I take a diss, wickedness to get crushed up
Movin' up on that bustop while stand inhale bustop
So you must stop
Fakin' the holy ghost in wakin' tryin to make this Star
Don't come apart, our hearts get a stake in
So don't be mad so what minds to the minimum
'Cause in then a man sendin' 'em holy wisdom
To let you know if it ain't from the heart and the mind
Stop throwin' up peace signs

[Chorus -D.J. Coolie Bee Scratches]
No peace sign [7x]
