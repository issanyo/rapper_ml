[Hook]
I'm doin' me
And you should do you
Why you worried 'bout me
You need to worry 'bout you [2x]
Yeah boy I do
And you should do you [3x]
Why-you-why-you worried 'bout me
You need to worry 'bout you
Yeah boy I do

[Verse 1]
Act-act-act-act a damn fool
Ball and I talk shit on every cut I do
(Yeah boy I do)
Dr-dress like it's my duty
The stitchin' in the pants match the brown in my Gucci
(Ya-ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do)
Blow-blow-blow one before court
Then pull up on your block in the new four door Porsche
(Yeah-yeah boy I do)
Talk-talk business on my cellular
Smoke a lot of weed and make money on the regular
(Yeah boy I do)
Be-be-be-be about mine
Take my cars to the club in a single file line
(Yeah boy I do)
Windy City campaign
Fuck the orange juice I mix the 'Tron with the champagne
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do)
A hundred thousand for the watch
A hundred thousand for the car
A couple thousand for the Glocks
(Yeah boy I do)
Get-get nice I do
See the way the outfit match up with ice I do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
St-st-stay fuckin' with the crooks
Peel the backwood and mix the sour diesel with the kush
(Yeah boy I do)
Smoke-smoke out my perimeter
This Benz is so-so sick that they gonna have to take my temperature
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do)
Stay flooded like a star
Make the color of the diamonds match the color of the car
(Yeah-yeah boy I do)
Play-play a G-shock
If I'm in the club I got on the AP watch
(Yeah boy I do)
Stay-stay sipping on the Goose
Then throw twenties at the thickest one in here that's getting loose
(Yeah boy I do)
The da-the damn thing soon
As I get up in the motherfucking champagne room
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do)
Range Rover white body
White 24 Vellano's while you sitting on Asanti
(Yeah boy I do)
The tr-truck candy blue
Suede interior Killing them with the strut I do cuz

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No-nothing less than stacking dollars
And I stay looking fresh in nothing less than Parish and Prada
(Yeah boy I do)
I'm only fucking with ya boss
I ain't gotta break it down I just get it all off
(Ya-ya-ya-yeah boy I do)
Ma-ma-move-move with alarm
I'm not a shark in the water I'm a school of piranha
(Yeah boy I do)
In the Maybach on my iPad
Shut the curtain on the haters whenever I ride past

[Hook]
