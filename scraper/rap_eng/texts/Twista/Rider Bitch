(Twista)
You can't ride a bitch from the chi so make em bite the dust
Kane got the thangs that a girl bout to bust
Sticking all y'all love for the love so get down on your knees
Less you gonna kick it with us then here grow some weed
Riding through your ghetto smoking terror through lanes
Your areas game in the world of this bitch Erika Kane
Make you shine off your 20's come off all ya money
And cop with yo scratch man
Come back on the block and serve to full contain

(Erika Kane)
Diabolical bitch over beats like stylistic and stylistical shits
Would think I was working outta calico kits
Ride or die as if I was your geronimo bitch
High as the sky I throw ya body up with hollow point tips
Swallow ya dick then hit ya for ya keys
More about me I like them weaves g's and pussy fees
Cd's for cheese niggas is swee
Pussy platinum would leave em I'm saying
I ain't playing bitches got to eat
Only streets it ain't nothing nice bitches dying for ice
Ride these niggas raw sucking em right
Paying the price shit we got life in em
I got all these niggas locked what they bumping huh

(chorus)

(Erika Kane)
The world is my domain like the devil and shit
Spit game just to keep the ice bezelled and shit
The prettiest bitch even if I was the ugliest
I still had these niggas licking my clit when its the bloodiest
Throw what on ya shit run ya name to the dirt
Nigga I'm Ms. Kane and you gots to put in work
I be sly with my shit wink an eye with my shit
Whatever I gotta do to get em to ride with the shit
I ride high with my click do or die with my click
Got the flick in this bitch and we all ball legit
Type of chicken want all ya grip
Assets and estates
Type of chicken smoking pounds right down to the shake
Ain't no give and take nigga I'm taking no giving
Its a wild ass ride sometime I hate that I'm living
Thats why I smoke B's to the head and don't think about kicking
Keep my mind on this money cause a bitch got to stay flicking

(chorus)

(Erika Kane)
Everyday I scheme for cheddar get cheddar scheme for mo cheddar
All ya bitches follow me always been a trendsetter
Go getta in 96 I got em wetta
Gold digger always in it for the treasure
More liquor might make the durb betta but fo sho
If ya hit her off with the dough she'll make the swerve wetta
Just consider me licking you low nice and slow dadda
Figure figure a good to go oh you ain't know dadda

Peeping the willies splitting my phillies whole shitty
All up in my grillie yeah bitch I fucked ya nigga silly

Seeing me coming he trick 90 now I'm humming
Licking ya dummy got ya skeeting over ya tummy
Getting ya money ask a nigga Kane pussy sunny
Yo Deion a honey one hit nigga leave it bleeding and runny
