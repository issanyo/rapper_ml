[Hook: Lord Infamous]
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
Get the dope, chop it up
Get the plate, I can't wait
Fifth of Henn', in my hand
Ask for some, you too late
Now I'm high, really high
Man, I'm about to shout
I see you over there talking
But what the fuck you talking about?
Oh I'm blazed, in a daze
Purple haze and ash trays
Mac Mike you got the light
We green this ain't no fucking day
Black Havener
Craving the vapors of chronic
DJ P with no weed and no white
This shit is so fucking ironic

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
I got them blood shot red eyes
Look into my eyes
Did you see a big surprise
Can you tell a nigga high
I can fly, I can float
Meet your boy up on the boat
Watch me dive into the water
Like Titanic when it broke
Yo, keep the weed coming
Keep them drinks coming
Niggas walking around
In a daze like they need something
Green bumming
Lighters flicking
On the road their ain't no finish
Send them back
Stop in the kitchen
Nigga this is just the beginning
Yeah!

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed

[Verse 3: ​​Lord Infamous]​
Hearses circling my house with wack-ass rappers in the rear
Hella lame in my ear, I come to ruin your career
Vocal cords sore, cyborg, morgue souvenir
Skins of belly, body smelly, death is in the atmosphere
Peace is extinct, bloody street, make them stink
Planes crash, ships sink, every boss gets weak
Every enemy sleep, feel the nuclear nigga heat
May I propose a toast? It's coming close to World War III
Fright night under moonlight, Memphis butcher
Mutilate and torture pressure cooker, Satan took ya
I'll beat ya till there's nothing left but slop
Feed you to the swamp
Running through the forest like Gump, bloody tree trunk
Bitch, you want a piece of these?
Might as well take the heart
There was no love from the start
Sprinkle body parts
Woe, onto you my foe
'Cause you just don't know
Smoked out, snorted, drunk, blowed

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed
I'm smoked out, snorted out
Drunk and then I'm blowed

[Verse 4: Twista]
Got me gone off herb
And the erk when I swerve to the curb
For the derb in a 'burban
Fresh off earling and
Hanging out where they serve
They still got some Phillies and we pearling
Show me where they working
From the bank dawg
Money on a fifth of Henn'
Tell the motherfucker drink up
While the skunk weed start to stank up
Bitches, go and get some gin
We gon' get the party cranked up
Put your bank up, we gon' need more
Reefer chain cause our cryptic addicted to weed smoke
Hit the Swishers and proceed slow
Take a pull, choke, shit, this weed dope
And I'm off my square now
Went and yelled out
Where the nigga trying to get sloppier
Dropping ya
If you trying to get us
While we uzing them
Rolling with the Three 6 mafia
Popping ya, popular
Bucking niggas with the rhyme
Close encounters of the herb kind
Leave you sitting on the curb crying
South side getting bucked up
In a party with a burb mind
We gonna tear this bitch up
Cause we fucked up
Gone off that sticky
When the Zoloft then hit me
Having paranoid illusions
Of nigga trying to get me
Infatuated with drugs
Smoked out, snorted out, drunk and then blowed
Getting crunk in that mode
Twista gotta stay high
Smoke a skunk 'til I'm old
Now chucking like im sea sick
On the front porch with the mob
And we be thick
Roll when you see Twista and Three 6
Who can bog the motherfucking mind
Like an eclipse on the weed tip
