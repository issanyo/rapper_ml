[Verse 1: Twista]
I'm about to take everybody back to the basics
I'm historical, an oracle and event is about to occur
Because a motherfucker put these raps in the matrix
And I'm a terror when I spit it on tracks full of hatred
But there's beauty in the dark, just put it in your mouth
And the flow is, mmmmm... like that when you taste it
Coming niggas like a disciple of death
You would think I'm popping a rifle or TEC
I'm aiming right for the neck
Your mama might as well call up the funeral home
So she can write them a check, a violent dialect
That's why they feelin' me, a trilogy
A horror is what I become so they call me Jason Vorhees
Oops, I mean Jason More-Cheese
Niggas gotta pay some more fees
Hot enough to break a thermometer from another planet
I kill 'em from here to Andromeda
A comet'll hit the planet when I'm in the middle of rapping
Swallow you, a diabolical astonisher
Astronomer because I'm out in the galaxy
Challenge me, I will disintegrate your body like a particle
Follow you into a corridor at four in the morning
So I can horrify you right before I slaughter you
My boys saying they don't think I'm coming with it
So you know a nigga gotta get 'em all
Then I'mma be murdering them like a serial killer
Then I'mma hide them in the ceiling and the wall, fuck 'em all Niggas'll never get next to this
I rock a Rollie so I flex the wrist
I'mma blow up and sit in your place
Then throw up shit in your face like the Exorcist
You can't mess with this

[Hook]
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow coming with that new shit
Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect
In the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more
Now let's take shit back to the basics
How we used to do shit
With the original sound
But still somehow coming with that new shit
Talk about the way there ain't no morals or respect
In the streets no more
Don't pause with the heat no more
'Cause there really ain't nothing out here to eat no more

[Verse 2: Twista]
Nowadays niggas acting like they loving to die (why?)
Used to be some respect
But now they just kill 'em and stack 'em
'Cause Benjamin Franklin the governor now
Theoretically you better be ahead of everybody around you
'Cause a nigga might fuck you
Don't need to be nothing but killers in your family
That always surround you 'cause a nigga might touch you
Since the recession it's been hard on the streets
So a nigga comin' hard on the beats
No order in the hood
I remember when niggas would get into it
They would have to take problems to chief
Now they don't give a fuck who they be shooting
Or who they be robbing or what you ride
All they really care about is who got that
And if you let one of these knuckleheaded bitches
Know you sitting on something, motherfuckers is gon' be at that
Southside Murderers
It's the Westside Killas
Up north and over east is a beast
What they release be leaving you deceased
Fuck up anybody that try to do damage
The block is the planet and shorties is too bucked
For it to be peace, so I carry a piece
But I don't want to shoot it 'cause I already want to
See some of my niggas locked up in jail home
Instead of hollerin' at 'em on a cell phone
R.I.P. cuz' my lil' brother Rel' gone
Gotta show a different way to get it instead of
Being on the attack full of hatred
Or get smacked in the face with
The reality of death if we don't get back to the basics
