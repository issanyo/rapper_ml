[Hook: Huey Mack]
I like two things: women and good drinks
If I have that I'mma be alright
I don't know what tonight'll bring but I know what I'mma think
If this was my last day and I died tonight
You should play this at my funeral
Play this at my funeral
You should play this at my funeral
Play this at my funeral
You should bury me next to two bad women
Know I went out without a single fuck given
You should play this at my funeral
Play this at my funeral
Now pour your motherfucking drinks out -

[Breakdown]
Now pour your motherfuckin' drinks out (x2)

[Verse 1: Huey Mack]
Cold drinks and bad bitches; my favorite things
Going out like every night, I swear I live a dream
I'm young as hell, I got a lot to learn
But I'm young as hell so I'm not concerned
Plus I got a blunt to burn with a broad, her ass is firm
Young and dumb and living life like every night
I could get a real job but a normal life is overhyped
Middle finger all up in the club like I love this shit
I can't die until I cross Selena off my bucket list

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twista]
Let me see you sippin' liquor till you buzzin'
All about the fame and everybody clubbin'
Cause this a celebration even though it's a funeral
Call it a homecoming
Don't need no piano to handle the music
Just go tell the DJ to play this
To celebrate the fact that I was living I was given
I went out with a bang and I made it
Instead of pouring liquor for the homie
Let me see you put your glass in the sky
And get fucked up you would never let em know
That we ever ever and we never really die
And  spend a couple of dollars
And order some bottles and roll up another one I wanna hit it
And I wanna get it till they know that I'm gone
To one of my tunes cause I like to

[Hook]
