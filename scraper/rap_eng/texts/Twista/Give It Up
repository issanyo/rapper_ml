They give it away, give it away, give it away now (ooh)
She got dreams to have a +Californication+ with me
I could see from how she lookin she couldn't wait to hit me
Come on over here lil' mama so you could babysit me
Bounce that ass in front of me now that's the way to get me
Thinkin about how she suck by the way she part them lips
