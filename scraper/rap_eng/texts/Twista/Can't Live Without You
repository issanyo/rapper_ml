[Twista:]
I knew she was the bomb
When I met her at in a balla home back in Cali
She was pretty but I knew she was dangerous
When I took her for a ride to mah crib in the black denali
Got up in the mansion, makin' an expansion
In other words another part of my stable
Wanna lay her on the bed if I'm able
But she think it's better if I lay her on the table
Gotta break her down, get a whiff of her body
I'm thinkin "ooooooo she smells soo gooood"
Niggas already callin' me to get wit her
Damn, tha shit be circulatin' quick through the hoood
My fingas swellin' like a swisha
Grabbed the fatty and told her that my name twista
I wrapped her round then I licked her
And then I hit her.....
(inhale, cough cough, choke)
Take a break, I need to take a breather...
Told me to get back if I couldn't handle it I'm sweatin' like I caught a fever..
We was married in matrimony, and never gettin' divorced
And I could nevah leave her
She was the cannibus sativa
And I damn sho need her..

[Chorus:]
I make you laugh
I make you cry
When we make love
It feels so right
I can't live my life without youu -ou -ou -ou...
I make you laugh
I make you cry
When we make love
It feels so right
I can't live my life without youu -ou -ou -ou...

[Twista:]
She was ready in tha colorful
Lookin' good, and I call her mah lucky charm
Her tender biddles in the middle was better than skittles
And it ain't no riddle why she got the brothas up in arms
So spectacular, bringin' hoes to me
Feelin' the feelings I felt
It wasn't bout how I was makin' her feel
Shiiiettt...
She got me feelin' mahself
Feelin' great, don't hate
If a nigga crackin' a joke then I'mma start rollin....
Got the feel, can't chill
Got 'em feelin like they just invented the wheel, I'mma start rollin...
I'm so thirsty
I'm so fly
Everything is cool
I'm so high
When I be away from you fo awhile I have mixed emotions
When I get back witchu
(ahh)
I gotta fix mah potion..
Feelin' like I'm in another world, better than heaven
Now who we next to see?
She mah ecstacy
Forever next to me

[Chorus:]
I make you laugh...
I make you cry
When we make love
It feels so right
I can't live my life without youu -ou -ou -ou
I make You laugh
I make you cry
When we make love
It feels so right
I can't live my life without youu -ou -ou -ou...
