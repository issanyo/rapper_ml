[Oobie]
Uh, China White, Oobie, Twista

[Twista]
Now thick, we roll on plenty chrome
50 strong when the temp is on, then I kick it on
Butter-bee how could you get it wrong
Girl yo homey don't know what she talkin' bout
Told you I came at her, now you wildin' and walkin' out
She tryin' to hate
You took the bait and you shoulda just been tickled
Cause you rollin' on 20-inch nickels
Neck and wrist full of sickles
Oobie, you wanna do me
Girl please, I'm who you need
Steady stackin' G's, I'm been givin' you too much cheese to leave

[Oobie]
Every time that I come around you
You're shovin' yo money all up in my face
And that's you're first mistake
The things that you bought for me were cool
But I still don't have to give in to you
You can't buy me

[Chorus]
Boy you bout to get lonely
Pushin' up on my homey
Cause you don't know me
You don't know me
And boy you got to be crazy
Thinkin' I was still yo lady
But you don't know me
You don't know me

[Oobie]
Every time that I turn my back you
Are tryin' to get all in my homegirl's face
You know you're outta place
You embarrass yourself from the things you do
But it's not the issue
I don't want you
Don't want you
And she told me what you said about me
But you didn't tell her you were handin' out G's
Straight takin' care of me
Takin' care of me

Chorus

[Oobie]
Now boy you're not here do what you wanna do to me
Just cause you paid off my bills for me
You're not gon' lie and cheat on me
Especially not with my homies
You need to know that I heard all yo lies before
Don't be runnin' that bullshit on me no more
All dried out with them lies baby
That's why you about to be lonely

Chorus

[Oobie]
So back up off me, you don't know me
You playin' games but you don't know me
Up on my homegirl, you don't know me
That's why you lonely cause you don't know me
So back up off me, you don't know me
You playin' games but you don't know me
Up on my homegirl, you don't know me
That's why you lonely cause you don't know me

Boy you about to be lonely you
Pushin' up on my homey you
You about to be lonely you
You about to be lonely-lonely

Chorus
