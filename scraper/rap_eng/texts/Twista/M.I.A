[Hook 2X]
Niggas play hard
What can I say?
Kick shit off
M.I.A. (3x)
Kick shit off
M.I.A

[Verse 1]
Niggas play tough when they come through the scene
.44 cocked, cup full of lean
High top Chevy with a pocket full of green
Everybody talkin' loud without a killa on the team

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 2]
They say they ready for war
But they don't even know they literature

[Hook 4X]

[Verse 3 - Twista]
Niggas steady just be talkin'
But unfortunately I don't hear 'em
Shorty I go in, only I know when
I be creepin' on a motherfucker
Stuntin' on 'em like a Forgiato rim, black brim!
It be so many actin' worthy and they actin' dirty
Like they got the birdy and they got the thirty
But when they hear drama, it be
'now you see him, now you don't'
When they hear the sound of the black MAC-10
Don't let your mouth get you into some shit
Your ass ain't gon' get you out of
Cause if you do, now what?
You might have to suffer the consequences
Of what can happen to a coward!
Fool he actin' like they don't know they'll do ya
All up in a muh'fucka face without a shooter
Don't know it's lil' homie that's with him, holdin' a Ruger
Niggas that shoot a nigga over a bag of buddha
Booyah! (Blaow!)
I come from an era where the killas used to
Have the hitters on the roof
Sippin' on liquor that's a hundred and eighty proof
A shot from the clip appear then disappear with a 'poof'
Ooh! (Zap!) You the type to kick it off
Then when they go up, you be gone from the scene
I want them niggas that's gon' put on for the team
When it go off they go get the chrome with the beam
Because I know
