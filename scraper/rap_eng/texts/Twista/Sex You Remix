[Intro]
All the rain keeps falling
And these hoes keep calling

[Bridge: Bando Jonez]
All these rain drops falling on my window
Got me wishing that we did the things we didn't do

[Verse 1: Twista]
Twista
I call her up and tell her I wanna get some more
And even then I could never get enough
Cause when it comes to others its embarrassing
Ain't no comparison cause all I think about is your stuff
The dress hugging ya body I wanna pull it off
I wanna sex you so I wanna see what's under that
Make the sword get longer
Cause I see you got the Thunder Thunder Thunder Thunder Cat
So poor hit the hole like a running back
Through the secondary and almost scored a touchdown
Ain't no evil me or havoc or a bust down
Cause you the girl I wanna cuff now
I put you up on a pedestal with the ultimate status and give it to you how he won't
I snatch you up by the panties and bend you over the granite then give it to you how he don't
(Can I sex you, baby)
Gimme some of that
Kissing you on the neck
Make you call me daddy when I get you wet
Ya body I can paint a Van Gogh on
So go until ya man go home
Cause if anything can go wrong
It's probably cause you been fucking with Twista and Bando Jonez
I can never say that I got enough
When she let me get on top of her
With Louis V is how I'mma honor her
She hot enough to break a thermometer
How she act is making me wanna fuck
Tell her something to make her blush
We bigger than money and coming up
All you gotta know is

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
Don't call me a bugaboo
But does it trouble, a trouble, a trouble you?
You got all that passion trapped deep inside of her
Lately it's bubbling up on you
You ever get tired of study group?
You need to be doing what lovers do
Girls don't understand why you don't get a man
And I gotta say I'm puzzled too
Bring them double D's to the W
I guarantee you need another dude
It's a possibility we gonna need a new set of sheets
In fact we gonna need a new room
It's too wet, shoulda brought a rain coat
Too deep, shoulda brought a sail boat
I'm diving all in it like Cuba Gooding Junior
Diving like scuba
Don't take it for granted
Don't let a compliment go to ya head
Cause it's too many things I wanna do to you I have to show you instead
Going so hard, going so hard girl we done lost control of the bed
She told me don't stop, she told me don't stop
Now she done lost control of her legs
Good God

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Ay Bando ayye
Now I know ya wasn't tryin' to leave me out these remix
Oh no no you didn't, oh no you didn't
Imma put some Tallahassee on and show you how we do this G shit
Holding streets out in Philly
She tryin' to walk, looking like a newborn baby
Cause we been doing it constantly
She looked at me and asked if I do porn, maybe
No it ain't nothing like that
I'm just one of them freaky niggas from the south side
That a leave a trick with her mouth wide
Baby we can do it upside
Baby we can do it on the couch side
She coming again, I ain't say nothing
Ah, this is a win-win situation
She been playing hard to get
It's obviously I got her strung out
She gonna look back at me when I smack that ass I'mma have my tongue out
Like hey
Baby you know this the best you ever had
You ain't too bad
Baby keep up with it, keep up with it
We go deep up in it, deep up in it
I'mma have you asking me why this bed ain't got no seatbelts in it
I'mma goddamn genius on this Remix
The industry needs to put my penis in a testtube
To see why it’s so good when I…

[Verse 4: Brando Jones]
Sex you baby
I wanna know have you had any good sex lately lately lately lately
Have (Sex) have (Have you had it?)
Have (Sex) have (Good sex)
Have you had it (Sex, have you had it?)
Good sex girl (Good sex) oooh [?] baby
Baby have you had any good sex lately lately lately
(Sex, have you had it? Sex, good sex
Sex, have you had it?)
All these rain drops dropping on my window
