[Unknown man:]
Ey yo twista
Man, I'm getting sick and tired a' these sucka's tryin' to dis the style man

[Twista:]
Yeah, word up
So you know what we gon' do?
We gon' take it back to the original way it was done when it was called scatin'
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just drop me somethin' jazzy on the cut

[Unknown Voice:]
We're going to do a two

[Twista, Verse 1:]

(Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah
Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, -pah

Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah
Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, -pah

Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah
Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, -pah

Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah
Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, Chicka-pah, -pah)

Shoo-badi-doo, doo-be-doo, doo-be-doo
Shoo-badi-doo, dubie tat-tat-tat

Could you ever tell me, would ya find a cat
That could scat like that
Leaving party people laying on they back, (pah-pah)
Coming to the method of a lyrical epitome and it will be
A pleasure hearing words coming from a master of the tongue
Cus' I lay it over to the drum, but gibberish it may be to some
Cus' some, Say I talk allot or sayin' nothing
But I make it lovely when I break em over to the flow and this and
Never dis it if ya never never understood the art form, it is artsy
(a' sucka neva know it is)
Twista's product of a riff for a scat
(Shubidy ta-ta-ta like that)
Never wild, never single file, as I bring em out
See the way I pow, see a child see style
(Ta-tah, Ta-tah)
Take it away, when I come into the party with a sway
And I get up on the microphone and I rock it with the men
And we givin nothin but the best. (No delay)
(Yodelay-who)
Whata do, Whata do, Was a one two
(Tella Shuba-dubie-dubie-do)
When I come to the show with a flow, Let it go from an "Oh" to a' "Uuu" (Uuu huu)
I cry when I see another man dis another man flow
But he can for his many fans
How i break it over when I sing it out loud, that I think jealousy's at hand (and)
Never go against a method you don't know about, jack
When step into the party people think its fat
Full fucking metamorphosis, I break em off with this
It ain't quick rap, what I'm doing is a scat
(Ticka-Ticka-Ticka-Tah) (Chicka-Chicka-Chicka-Pah)
Come and listen to the rhythm of a star
Can you put the matter when I matter when I scatta flow
To make you wanna take your brain further for art

Shoo-badi-doo, doo-be-doo, doo-be-doo
Shoo-badi-doo, dubie tat-tat-tat

Could you ever tell me, would ya find a cat
That could scat like that
Leaving party people laying on they back, (pah-pah)
