Yeah we gonna do it like this
Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this
Speedknot Mobsters
Verse 1:

My click been strugglin' half a lifetime tryin' to get our shit on
Got no G's to sit on, even sold niggas sacks and packs to get on
But let me take you to a place where these niggas learn to better pain and stress
Look a murderer in the face, comin' up where the wild and deranged get blessed ...

1, 2, 3, and to the 44
The good, the bad, and the ugly stickin' you, fleein' through the front door
And we gotta do one more, even though debo watchin me like the lottery
We can still fulfill this West Side odyssey mobster prophecy

Well, mobbin', what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?
Jackin' off 20 G's cuz you got more money to scoop
Liff's a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
Constantly eyed by neighbors who do the Feds favors
It ain't no major, though, whether slangin' yay or blow;
As long as its payin' me, folk, my occupation criminal
Pullin' up on hoes as the weed smoke blows
The essence of a mobster's presence is the reason she chose
As the Regency rolls, on zeros, the pearl white Olds-
Mobile, shit, I'ma ride high til I die or get killed
Smoke like fields, forever dodgin' blue shields
With blue steel — I got foolproof escape skills
When paper chasin', leavin trails of shell casin's
Adjacent to the part of your body Where the blood's wastin'
A life taken ... Chicago ain't a city, its a Nation
And Solid's my foundation within the mobster organization

Chorus:

If it's dope, we shakin' it up; if its coke, we cookin' it up;
If it ain't hustlin' and we got some skunk, we gonna be smokin' it up
(Wild campaignin mobster for life, carved in gold and ice)
(Speedknots roll through Chi, too cold to die, known to get high)
Its an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang
Callin' cops for thangs, ready to squab or bang
Takin' your riches, plus we known for snatchin' your bitches;
The way Chi reign my family gotta maintain , its a mobster thang

Verse 2:

I'm a fat booty fuckin', love gettin' dick sucked and bustin'
Givin' niggas punkinheads for nothin'
While bumpin'. Handle my functions
My pistol's pumpin', got hoes jumpin', a mobster's always into somethin'

I can feel Killuminati lookin' over my shoulder
And somethin' keeps tellin' me to get mine before its over
Smokin' on plenty of buddah and still prayin' to get blessed
With forgiveness for the last time I sinned on this survival quest
From hustlin 24-7 to makin niggas get undressed
The mobster in me got me obsessed with lootchie and success
So I can care less if I gotta be lootin' or whoopin';
I'm sick of beggin' niggas for rides, Id rather be the one that's scoopin'
Cause in these last days it's day-to-day hustlin for Mayz;
I want fresh gear every day, fat-ass chains and 3 blades
Trippin' on that 2-faced nigga sweatin' dick while I rock the stage
Like these bitches is just tryin' to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
Like I can use her for turnin' tricks
Or either for hittin' licks and then rap about the shit
On one of the Mobstaz greastest hits
And when we come to your town(?)then raise it
Find the skunkiest weed you can, roll it up and blaze it

Chorus (2x)

I'm gonna make it through this New World Order if I gotta be rappin' and robbin';
You can't stop the Speedknot from mobbin' and if you try, we squabbin.'
We waitin' for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up
When these Chi-Town niggas roll, cause we don't believe in goin' head up

On a sweet lick for 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs
Hit me wit' love, black gloves, red eyes, the shiftiest thugs
T-shirt over my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the .380
Got a grip that was steady, adrenaline rushin' for fetty
Wild Irish Rose and Cisco make me rock the tightest flows but tip-toe
Up with the clip slow, gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo'
Cause I ain't that scummy. What the fuck got him bummy?
Got no time for rockin', choppin' in the car stoppin' with a stack of pack money
But you trustin' me, then I'm cuffin' shit, snatch all of your luxury
Try touchin' me, actin' tough as shit, my mobstas'll bust for me
Fuckin me'll make me hate you, permanently sedate you;
When the bullet penetrate you, it's goin' straight to your facial, unless we chase you
As we escape (?) by all means necessary
The rest is secondary — goin' for mine til my flesh is buried
The test is scary — for me to survive and hope we still'll be thick
With a trilogy clique for nine-seven Mobstability shit

Chorus(2x)

Ha, I just take a pull and inhale
Thinkin about my niggas thats locked up in jail
My mind dwells on crime cells, and wipin off nine shells
Only time will tell if we gotta use it
Ain't lookin for static , but if we got into it
We gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life
