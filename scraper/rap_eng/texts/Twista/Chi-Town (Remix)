[Verse 1: Phor]
I'm from the city where shorty's be wildin'
They run up and down, posted on Stoney Island
I gotta get my whole fam to an island
Some lobster and pasta, we eat like Italians
I caught the audience, let me get my nap
Jump out of my sleep and I start to think back
One thing about me, I always speak facts
This is Chi-Town, some say this is Chiraq

[Verse 2: Bump J]
My .30 filled to the top with them hollows
I'm on the couch, drinking out of the bottle
Your lil bitch thirsty, she all on my heels
She want a real nigga out in Chicago
I booked this bitch from the A, she was bad
Herm√®s and Birkin, man, she match my swag
We tore down Innocent, she match my bag
Your man can't come here 'less he got a past
I'm from the East, where they murder and serve the O's
We grew up poor, momma ain't gotta work no more
She called a flight just to fuck me, lil bitch, if you lucky, I might introduce you to Durky or Herbo or Bibby
My city be jumping like it got a vertical, swervin' convertible, flip through the town
Girl, let's go burn down Magnificent Mile, now
We used to tear down the lock in the plaza for Pelle's, these sneakers ain't in the stores
Now we just tear down [Pirelli?] or Billy on Rush Street, we hop in Aventadors
I'm really in it, man I do this shit for my city, I'm not tryin' to win awards
I told your lady, "just pop out" like KD, and make sure that she bring a friend for Phor

[Chorus: Phor]
It's no more ordinary lifestyle
We livin' for the moment, talkin' right now
She from out of town, she tryna book a flight to me right now
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the part of the city where niggas be lining you up (lining you up)
Driving my big brother's Lincoln, I tell the bitches that it's mine, I'm lying to fuck (don't tell them I'm lying to fuck)
Chilling on the block was exciting to me (gang, gang)
Got a couple moes that's riding with me (gang, gang)
Know a couple niggas that told on the king (know)
Misdemeanor, can't get indicted with the piece (bitch ass)
Bag hoes from Ford City, 'cause the party finna be t'd up at Mr. G's (woah)
City full of scams, they all going ham, CP in just to get keys (skrr)
And they doin' snatch-and-grab (grab)
Now my bitch is bad, she can turn up on Instagram (woah)
Fuck to R. Kelly (shout out)
Young nigga turning up, fucking in the minivan (skrt, skrt)
From the city of vultures
Ain't no pass: if we see 'em, we smoke 'em (yeah)
Bump and Slide made it cool to post up (yeah)
They really changed the culture (woah)
Larry Hoover had made me a gangsta
Shout out David Barksdale, tell him thank you (tell him thank you)
If a nigga play with me, boy don't stank him
Now we eating oxtails, came a long way from bacon
Muslim! Don't eat bacon (no)
Took so many percocets, they thought I was faking (thought I was faking)
Pharris and MoonDawg played me daily (hell yeah)
Play me on the radio, got me the [80 issue?]

[Chorus: Phor]
It's no more ordinary lifestyle
We livin' for the moment, talkin' right now
She from out of town, she tryna book a flight to me right now
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town

[Verse 4: Twista]
Thinking about the time nobody was dealing with us (yes)
Never was able to benefit, nothing was given to us (nope)
Nobody giving a minute to look at the Middle and get with the people around, now we at the top of the game, look how we living it up (woo!)
Gotta admit, we took over the industry and everybody out here be feeding off of the energy
Not being recognized is just a memory and I guarantee you, don't nobody wanna be our enemy (true)
Needed a spark and Chicago was the remedy (true)
From the jump, I always told you this here was meant to be (true)
Assassinated our character like a Kennedy (true)
Now the description of the style of the Bentley be (coupe)
Custom interior, she wanna feel it
I stay in foreign and everything vintage
Downtown at the W, she wanna get it
She not from here but say she wanna visit
Well come thru (come on)
Take you through K-Town and through The Loop
Don't be scared because it ain't no roof
Well-protected, all these niggas shoot
So come and get with it, what is you waiting for?
Windy City and we ever ready for war
Everybody represent this here to the core
Chicago symphony, orchestrated through Phor
I know you want war
Twista

[Chorus: Phor]
It's no more ordinary lifestyle
We livin' for the moment, talkin' right now
She from out of town, she tryna book a flight to me right now
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town

[Outro: Phor]
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town, Chi-Town
She wanna fuck with a nigga from the Chi-Town
