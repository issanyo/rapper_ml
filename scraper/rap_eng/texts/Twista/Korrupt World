[Hook: Twista]
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up

[Verse 1: Twista]
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling
Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him
Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost
Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught
So now his life's his cost
You might get caught
So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified
All the best that tried won't even slide
So just bless the rest that died
Is it a test of pride when inside
You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it
Could it be a motherfucker that you notice
On the other side of the bullet
Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'mma waste him
It's just a murda for the nation
But some end up locked up, broke up
For felonies and don't nobody motherly embrace him
Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body
With people around sad and froze
Teardrops and rain
But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed
How it's drastic shows in the mother through a frown
Even though the gunner was found
'Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around
Now he under the ground
'Cause they gonna get down in these streets
Even though you pack a piece for heat these niggas urgin' to bust
The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb
If you out there serving em' up

[Hook: Twista]
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt

[Verse 2]
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring
Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see this thug mourning
As these streets erases others it encase a brother
You had enough heart to waste this brother
But could you face his mother? I was faced with other
Type of problems that had held me back
Couldn't tell me jack now I'm grown in my own zone
You ain't gotta tell me that so come trail me back to a time
When a motherfucker lost his will survive
Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal
Even had to kill to survive

[Twista]
I remember when you had my back
When the relative passed and my momma cried
When the house caught flames
You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father died

I take drama in stride
Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together
Still suffer but the worst is gone
So it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter
But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate
Smoke weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes
To keep the kids straight
Cause you did straight if your seed proceed
Long as they keep learning and keep growing up
Right now to survive in a place that's full of doubt
And about to self-destruct

[Hook: Twista]
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt
Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt

[Verse 3: Twista]
Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize
Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land
Where the unforgettable dies
Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it
If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon
Womb to the tomb death is in the next room
If a nigga ain't realizin' AK's and Tech's doom
Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you
After he just took a blast at you
You won't have it you killed him
There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you
Tellin' you a stranger must be crazy
To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous
'Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle
If we have two things to bust
It's cocaine to us and my brains the dust
I represent till I'm dead so why try?
Long as I leave my enemy bust, vicinity crushed
I don't really give a fuck if I die, so why lie?
My people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost
It's a plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying
With their grandmother's hand on the cross
So I take a stand when I talk, ran instead of walked
To chalk another victory
How you did the caper hid the paper
Breaking other niggas off is a mystery
With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs
Just keep comin' up, better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets
In a ghetto of a world that's corrupt

[Hook: Twista]
