(Sample from M.I.A's "Paper Planes")
No one on the corner have swagger like us

(Verse 1, Lil Wayne)
Pull up on the corner, windows down on the space ship
Ballin' so hard man, I deserve a Naismith award, applaud
Like I'm on stage bitch, married to the money (Evil Empire)
I just skipped the engagement
I'm fly, my ally is the bird game
The top flew off of my whip, bird brains
Third lane in the back of the first lane
I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for this purple rain
Earth to wayne, call it Wayne's World
Money money, call 'em Wayne's girls
Young money gangstas
Runnin this shit like a flanker
Ain't a clique like mine
We click like 9's
And we get higher than six by nines
The stove ain't watch, cuz it's my time
Bathroom swagger ain't shit like mine

(Hook) [Jim Jones]
No one on the corner have swagger like us [Not at all]
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us

Swagger-swagger like us [I don't know what corner they from]
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us [We from them corners that do it]
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us [On my corners we make swag]
Swagger like us [And we sell it to y'all]
Swagger-swagger like us [JONES!]

(Verse 2, Jim Jones)
Took ballin to a phenomenon (What else?)
I caught niggas snorin with no pajamas on (Section C)
Talkin slick, who am I to reply?
So fly, you would have to shoot me out of the sky (I got my target)
Mayday-mayday, they said he parachuting
The air got polluted when I had the Maserati (Vroom)
But now I'm gettin green, I'm thinkin higher than Ferrari (Yes)
You should call me god body (Learn ya lessons)
Fresh to def to the arm legga legga (And)
All white Nikes, check the bomb was venetta (And)
One jet, I can change the weather
Lookin all gully in my herm-ay skully (Damn)
Threw on a scarf, look with a different Louie (Whatever)
Niggas can't touch me like Jim had the cooties (He got the cooties!)
Stunt so hard that niggas wanna sue me
The rap money good, but wait 'til I get to movies!

(Hook) [NOE]
No one on the corner have swagger like us [Like the young Will Smith of this shit]
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us [Bird game baby, capo what up!]
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us [Yeah, Baltimore banger, man]
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us [Let me test this mic out]
Swagger-swagger like us

(Verse 3, NOE)
Listen, who kid? It's the new kid
The ber-berry boss, asterisk on the shoe, kid (Fly)
The Baltimore Buccaneer, the explorer
In Tom Ford linen and a crispy fedora
Caught throwin a tilt
Thought I was the man 'til I puff the open sex, her ass dropped on the silk
The nocturnal hustla, product of the evening
Gritty, runnin through New York City like the thieving
Time to up the ante
Pockets uncanny
Bulging Kim pussy pressed against the panty
Now I'm in Vermont, and done funny in Miami
Duckin rat packs like Sinatra and Sammy
Trust me, I've been underneath the tap
Doin time, pressin jeans underneath the mat
Waitin on feet up
Now I hate to speed up
My g, you wanna ride?
You gotta raise the front seat up

(Hook)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us
Swagger-swagger like us

(Verse 4, Twista)
T the best!
I styled it with that category
Others got a lot of stories
All these other rappers bore me
They say Twista, won't you take this to your laboratory
No ones in the category
Talk about your swagger for me
Nobody fuckin wit Twist'
I be havin to fill the irrelevant
And then I be killin 'em off with my ana'
It's like I'm a scorpion, like I'm an elephant
Fill 'em with venom and then I'mma stomp 'em into oblivion
Like I'm a million, like I'm a billion
Like I'm a trillion, I'm a gazillion, hey!
Hit 'em in the body with a millimeter then I gotta put 'em in the dirt
Put me in the middle of the money, cuz I know I gotta get it
So I know I gotta work
Grab them since '91, when I came at them differently
I am the first
They be comin and travelin with the dead bodies of rappers
And I am the hearse
Twiiiiistaaaa
I'mma get money killa, stay full of swagger
And that eat'cha beat'cha
Twiiiiistaaaa
I got that horror flow
Call it the creature feature
