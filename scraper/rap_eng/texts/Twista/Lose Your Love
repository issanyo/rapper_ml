[Twista]
Christina Milian makin millions yall
Ya boy Twista in da house ya dig
Oh you tried to play ya boy bogus
But I can't have that
What you got to say?
Come on

[Verse 1 - Christina]
I really need you to listen
Really sit back and listen
I got somethin to say
It's not goin to be easy
I'd rather you hear it now from me
Than hear it round the way

[Hook - Christina]
I don't wanna lie no mo
Don't wanna creep on love
(I hate that I let you down and I)
Can't even understand
What I was searchin for
(Cuz you're the one I adore)

[Chorus - Christina & Twista]
We had our problems but still
You're never gonna find a lovin this real
Ask me what chu want and I will
I'm for real
(I don't wanna lose your love)
[Repeat]

[Verse 2 - Christina]
I'm sittin back wishin
That it was you I was kissin
Can't take back this mistake
I let lust defeat me
Lovin you more completely
Didn't wanna end this way

[Hook - Christina]
I don't wanna lie no mo (no more)
Don't wanna creep on love
(I hate that I let you down and I)
Don't know the words to say
I hope you don't walk away
(I kinda want you to stay)

[Chorus - Christina & Twista]
We had our problems but still
You're never gonna find a lovin this real
Ask me what chu want and I will
I'm for real
(I don't wanna lose your love)
[Repeat]

[Bridge - (Twista) {Christina}]
I don't wanna lose your love {I will}
Don't wanna lose your love

Don't wanna lose your love {ba-by}

(Christina ya hurtin 'em out there girl)
I don't wanna lose your love {Oooh}
Don't wanna lose your love
(Oh we bout to put it down togetha)
Don't wanna lose your love {Yeah Yeah}
(Uh huh)

[Twista]
Now I took the rhythm with the ti-took-ti-took uh
Twista rollin hard thinkin it's a hood thang
We makin harmony like a ??
Girl don't wanna lose my lovin I got the good tang
Now you tellin me you was messin around wit some other guy
So my feelings are ?? I can't hide
Listen to the crib I'm takin the BMW truck
I'm finna get in the Bentley baby I gotta ride
But can he put the designer clothes on yo back ?
He ain't messin with none of my status or cadillacs
I know I'm sittin on spinnas dat be a lil bigga
I know ain't nobody betta when rubbin yo back
I see a lovely world that we can peek in
Let's stay togetha cuz I know the drama gon pass
We can send tha haters to school on da weekend
Girl let the competition go he ain't got no class

[Chorus (Repeat)]

[Bridge with adlib]
