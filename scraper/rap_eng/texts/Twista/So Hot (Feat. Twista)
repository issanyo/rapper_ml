[Charlie Wilson + Twista]
So hot
Charlie Wilson (Yo)
Your boy Twista (So hot)

[Twista]
Now where the mama at
Let me look at your body at
I love them ladies with fatties
And you've got a lot of that
Are you good to do the jam
Or make me catch a heart attack
Sister can I get with you
Can you win Twista and Charlie's mind
Girl, don't wanna be cocky
Let me show you where the party's at

[Charlie]
I see you mixing through that boo (At the party)
All the fellas are checking (A sexy party)
Shorty, you've got just a pretty face
And a player like me needs sip
And have a drink boo
I'm hallucinating, I'm seeing you (Looking right back)
I like the way that she's dancing (She's looking sexy)
And a brother like me could spit or taste
And my brother put this big old smile on my face, oh

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Ooh)

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Yeah)

They claim my stuff won't be back in (To make it happen)
You've got to want it like I do (Nothing at it)
I figured it won't be home to be convinced
Cause a dime like you on my arm makes perfect sense

Touching in the party
Want to leave the party with you (Let's leave the party baby)
Sexy little hottie, tell me what you want to do

With me

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Woah)

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Yeah)

[Twista]
Let me get it with that
Twista, what should I call her?
Roll through the hood in a Bentley with a baller
Take a trip to the Sybaris
And make you cut your phone off
Put the music on, get you in the bed
And pull your thong off

Big money black man
I must see not bad
Falling up out of the black band
Pumping me some Gap Band
Don't leave me happy
Till you're through with the crew
Let me see you break it down
Let me hit it with the floor
And make you do what it do

So what's up shorty, won't you jug?

[Charlie]
(Come on, work that body)
You know what I'm looking for
So baby just come on

(Don't hurt nobody)
You've got my attention
I'm watching you work it baby

(Come on, work that body)
You know what I'm looking for
So baby just come on

(Don't hurt nobody)
You're so hot
You look fine, girl

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Woah)

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Woah)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Yeah)

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Hop in the ride with me)
On the road with you, shorty let's go (Oh)
Onto the other mess (Onto the other mess)
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that (Don't hurt nobody, Come on)

She's so hot, she makes you want to say (Oh-oh-oh)
On the road with you, shorty let's go
Onto the other mess
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that

She's so hot (Hop in the ride with me)
On the road with you (Let's go back to the spot with me)
And sip on some Hennessy
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that

She's so hot (Hop in the ride with me)
On the road with you (Come on back to the spot with me)
And sip on some Hennessy
Don't hurt nobody, let me work with that
