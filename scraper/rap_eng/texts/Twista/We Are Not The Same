[Bridge]
Shed a lot of blood and cried a lot of tears just to get a nigga here
You’re the employee of the month but I’m the man of the year,
Might breathe like me but can’t see like me, court vision for the game,
Finally this point just to prove this point that we are not the same

[Hook]
We are not the same, we are not the same, (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same, (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same, (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same, (We’re not the same)

[Verse 1: Los]
King Los uh
Dear pops, I had a dream and you appeared in it twice
You were near to me, and you were here with advice
Your view was clear and precise, fewer peers in my life
Will pursue the fears that they felt and you appeared to be right
You told me never wait cause the weight that I would abandon
Would hit the ground til it’s shaking, then crack and create a canyon
In other words this world is my canvas so paint freely
But paint freedom cause this shits so deep that you can’t free me
Before you faded you stated hatred that I could harness
Inside my heart, will just haunt me or harm me until I’m honest
Honestly I am on it, on it beyond the comets
A comet beyond the stars, starting to really vomit
The sickest scripture's encryptions
My shit’s equipped with description
Descriptive wisdom of vision, vision livin' in rhythm
Different from niggas triggered by trickery in the prison
Your intuition was given and faded off in the distance like

We are not the same, we are not the same. (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same. (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same. (We’re not the same)
We are not the same, we are not the same. (We’re not the same)

[Verse 2: Twista]
Wuddup Los? Twista
To live the life I live, my soul is matching perfect
Just check how graphic the verse is
The others don't scratch the surface
I’m ugly as after birth is
Wicked as snatching purses
Fuck bitches with matching purses
Put niggas in matching hearses
I be different in many kinda ways
And that’s why I gotta let you know I'm not you
Used to be up on the block on the roof
When I see a nigga pull up on the block, let’s shoot
What you lookin at the shock and the proof, witness how we are so different
You happy with what you got, I see more then go get it
Yea, while you stay inferior, notice
I never settle for less, I look for ulterior motives
A confident calmness but pompous compass for riches
Corner congressman but Nostradamus with clockin' dollars and bitches
I’m as ambitious as a king of kings
Better then a Ryback, with a backpack and a fat sack
And a clap clap with a black Mack, never come up with the facts
Everybody better knew I’m in another universe
I’mma never be the image of another one
Los and Twista nigga, light up!
Smoke another one, and another one!
