[Verse 1]
When you in the city, and Chi is cold
Whoa, with the winter coat, feeling every bit of dope
I feel like a gyroscope, so
Off balance it's a challenge to be vertical murder
You Richard Pryor's soul
From the iller feeling spirit of Bernie Mac
Attacking Twista but it's funny how I never try ‘em though
Dilligently realest spittin' butter my opponent if he want it
A product of my environment though
Cause see I’m a crook
I’m on the front porch blowing eons of kush
A G I'm a G-ometry
Genius and I want the money like Kendrick wants Rihanna's bush
Nicki 252 cards in the deck
Deal it out the way you want it no guarantees in the windy city
Pity you a Ph-Philly you hard to respect
Fill it out cause if you don’t the situation could be pretty icky
Middle of the map
More nigga's be dying in my city than when I'm in Iraq
Po pimpin’ then I’m feeling like I’m t
Escaping the violence to go and get a little bit of that
Good bud when I’m on the west side, I
Had a little bit of haze when I was in Bed-Stuy
But this be the best I
If I had any I would laugh if you say you had a better bag
It ain't never that fire
Cause if it is give me some of that
We can smoke until we burn the whole house down, Left Eye
Can’t spend it all, can’t smoke it all, can’t hit ‘em all
I don’t give a fuck, let’s try, blowing on the remedy
Living where the killers up, techs on enemies
Chi-Town be the shit, but I'm finna take a trip
To get me some of that West Coast Trinity...
