Haha, heh, last time for the mobsta
Get up in here and do our thang, heh
That's how we gon' do
Hahahaha

[Twista]
Get down to the club
Chokin' on sticky and everything was loved, oh yeah
Look here now
Then on came the lights, hey
All the niggas and bitches in the party was feelin' high
Liffy Stokes bring it

[Liffy Stokes]
Tonight's gon' be the bomb, it's warm and calm
I got to take this cool in my arm with an ounce in my palm
I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break em down through my winnings and come out Detroit grinnin
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me

[Hook]
When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with

[Mayz]
I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop

[Hook]

[Twista]
Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) so I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Ho figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face
Takin' pictures, (?) close 'em all bitches' probably in the place
Straight po pimpin', I'm trippin' (?) it's the weekend
Steady quickin', take a pimpin' and pay the scraps for sneakin'
Cause when the...

[Hook til End]

Throw it up, are you a true money maker
Throw it up, cause you a big time playa

[Repeat til End]
