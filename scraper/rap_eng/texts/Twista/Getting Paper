[Verse 1: Twista]
You ever seen what a real nigga look like?
Sittin in the Lamborghini lower than the black 'vette
With a pocket full of money lookin for a honey
Stuntin and never trippin on nothin cause I got that
Exquisite taste, chase paper, capers on my résumé
And where I lay might get a little bit, lonely
On the grind, so I be missin' the feelin'
Of a woman touchin' me and layin all up on me
But I see you got the make-up and the tendencies
A complete understandin' that a nigga gotta work
Even though she be havin' a attitude
I tell her "You ain't gotta curse baby, I'ma buy the purse"
I feel like she a fly bitch
The only one I wanna see in fly kicks
And I want her to be mine so I spit her some game
From a nigga guaranteed to die rich

[Hook: Dra Day]
You can be my ride or die chick, I be on my shit
I be gettin paper, paper, girl
You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit
I be gettin paper, paper, girl
I be on my shit, I be on my shit
I be on my shit
You so bad you so damn thick, and I be on my shit
I be gettin' paper, paper, girl


[Verse 2: Twista]
Go 'head and put it where you wanna put it
And while you at it let me get some footage
And it ain't no need for you askin' me could it
Cause when we get in our mode I'ma show you how good it
Gets, because I be on my shit
And I be doin' my thang nobody better than this
Come if you ready to hang you wanna be with the Twist?
Would you be with it if I wanna travel and take you into the abyss?
Give me the word and I'ma cuff
Cause I be feelin' like we've both been waitin' long enough
You got that loud pack pussy other bitches huff
Deep inside sweet and sexy but you act tough
That's what I need on my team
Somebody gettin' it that I can fuck and spoil with some fly shit
And I really feel like she can be my sidekick
My gettin' high chick my ride or die chick
Let's go

[Verse 3: Dra Day]
I know you can tell by the 30's that I'm sittin' on
Take a whiff of this shit, this Dolce
Mix it up with the purp, it's okay
Later on I'm free to lay, lay
Lay anywhere you want
Just say the word and I swear that it's gon' be on
I be on my jungle shit, baby no lie
Freak you like an animal from the backside
Got the bomb shit, shawty that'll change your life
Feels so damn good I'ma make you cry
Oh, hold up, wait a minute
Seizin' up, and I'm in it
Now pull it out, I'ma finish
Oooooooooh yeah
