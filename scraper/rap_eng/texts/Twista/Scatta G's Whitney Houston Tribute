[Verse 1 Twista]

What? somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was getting better now its really just blew aside
I still ain't got over Don Cornelius suicide
So where do I start it
Dearly departed
One of heavens angels for sure who was really an artist
Loving the way that my mama would say she could sing and the way it was magical
Ain't nobody like you
Nobody before you and nobody after you
Can never come near it
Not here in the flesh but wit us in spirit
So said to hear it
I'm chocking up while I come up wit these lyrics
And tho she blessed the earth and it's time to let heaven prosper
I still wish somebody was there to protect her
Who
Kevin Costner
Who
Clive Davis
Who
Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time don't want it to be this way
But if she was here then she would probably say

[Hook Whitney Houston]

If I should stay
I would only get in your way
So I go
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

[Verse 2 Scatta G.]

I had my verse ready already
Holding my head cause its heavy
Reminiscing and missing Aaliyah, Left eye, Biggie, and Machiavelli
Now I just got the new that Whitney left me
Tho she never met me
I gotta show my respect and release this stress off my belly
Whitney
Houston
You one of heavens angels for real
Fame kills and I'm feeling like fuck a record deal
I'll work my nine to five tuck my pride and save up
Say a prayer for all the lost souls who gave up
Spread yo wings and fly where nobody can hurt ya
You at peace but for me it seem like the streets getting worser
Whitney
Yo voice is magic we can't help but to feel ya
When you was in the heartbreak hotel I was up in there wit you
We miss you
And could never forget you or the lessons you taught us
You should feel honored you remind me of my mama
Yeah
It's not right but it's o.k. Ima make it anyway
And I know if you was here then you would say
