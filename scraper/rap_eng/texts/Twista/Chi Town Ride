[Hook: Easy]
It's a Subway thing, thang, thang
With the 90's swing, sway, sway

[Verse 1]
It's time to max and relax
All aboard get inside
Pay your fair, take your chair
Get ready for the funky Chi Town Ride
I'm making moves so pay your dues
Don't be acting like no fool
You gots to chill
(You gots to chill, gots to chill)
Ain't no sleeping on my train
(Ain't no sleeping on my train)
Next stop is Stinky Lane
(Stinky Lane)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get ya mama over there
All the players look and stare
Old man gators just stepped in
Slapping bones with them twins
It's all butter, it's all good
They're my homies from the hood
That's how we roll
(That's how we roll)
So now ya know
(So now ya know)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Easy]
Bam!
Slum dung widdily diddily diddily diddily diddly dong
No need to run because the Subway come
The home of Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan
Watch me now
[?] and live as one
This is the time we wait for our share and
[?]
Bam!

[Interlude: Twista talking]
Yeah Taking you on a journey to the southside. To the northside. To the westside. Check the structure

[Verse 4: Twista]
Huh
I break things down like an analyst on cannabis
Represent Chi Town with Subway the love way
The devil damn he mad at this
You can't derail a freight train on a Chi Town ride
Cause it's a fixture of southern Twista
Wicked Chicago mixture
Get the picture?
I'm the conductor
Is you that sucker to get served like a butler
For testing musical structure?
That leads it to journeys for party people to take a fresh ride
Killer boys from Illinois and K-Town straight off the westside
