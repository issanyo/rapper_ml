Hook [x2]
Everywhere I go, know I keep it on me /
Keep it on me, I don't fuck broke niggas /
Only bosses only, bosses only /
No time for they feelings, fuck bitches want millions /

[Verse 1: Twista]
You know that the Twista higher than a flight attendant /
Got some niggas that'll take you out you die on my decision /
My niggas shoot at weddings, funerals /
Catch you at the [?]
I'm still legendary and idle with it /
When it comes to this rap, I'm crafty and vital with it /
Still on that bullshit like Scotty Pippen and Michael did it /
If it's not it's a fact it get critical, no survival with it /
I don't hang with broke niggas I don't do the diss records /
Or walk up approach niggas, semi in the range, I'm liable to smoke niggas /
In the chi got the power, they call me the ghost nigga /
[?] send him to go get him /
Expedition so you can't get rid of me hoe nigga /
Come with me he got the breeze, the lords, and the folks with him /
Send him off and I'm a bring a ending to your nigga /

[Verse 2: Twista]
Everywhere that I go you know I gotta keep it on me /
Married to money and you know I did in to holy matrimony /
And I'm a never leave the crib without a strapper for me /
Chicago niggas will catch you lacking, keep it ratchet homie /
You really ain't getting money so stop the acting homie /
And please believe, if we beefing, I'm 'bout that action homie /
Catch your bitch in my show and know that I'm smashing homie /
I'm gonna get money until the day they close the casket on me
I don't hang with broke niggas I don't do the diss records /
Or walk up approach niggas /
What's all that shit you was talking before nigga /
Before I turn your ass into a ghost nigga /
Bitch I'm part of the mob, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga /
Money long I be paid, I be ducking these gold diggers /

Better hide the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost with him /
