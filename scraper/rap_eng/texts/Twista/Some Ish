Mmm, ain't this some shit?
I done popped me a pill with a bitch and a bitch
And her bitch got a bitch
And my bitch got a bitch and we all like
Mmm, ain't this some shit?
I done popped me a pill with a bitch and a bitch
And her bitch got a bitch
And my bitch got a bitch and we all like

[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I just want a girl who love dem girls
The same way that I do
If she can cook and fuck me good
I just might say that "I do"
And now I'm rolling, rolling, bussing
If it's dough, no discussion
If you want it, go and get it
If you don't know nothing, you know
I'mma drink this drink
Smoke this weed, I'mma get this bank
I'mma get back home
And my bitch stuck up like her shit don't stink
Want a freaky ho then we could get a hotel
Bitch is selling pussy and she's selling it for wholesale
Baby tryna get a ring like a doorbell
I lick the kitty if it's good and there's no smell
I told her go slow
Let's go somewhere that we could both go
And bring some juice for me to mix with
I'm about to try and run the distance

Ladies
They love them sexy ladies
I'm fucking with you baby
I'm fucking with you baby

[Verse 2: Twista]
I knew she was the best I would discover, she became my
Bisexual lover, bring her badass friends with her up under the cover

What she would do to her, I know she a freaky motherfucker
She be super cool, mega thick, beau be thick and then we looking at a bitch, what she be talkin' about? "Mmm, she fine"
So I let her holla at her, if she coming to the party
I be talking bout "mmm, she mine"
But she says she know another one
That she can get it, she could go and get another one
That she don't play around, shit, I'mma go ahead
Stay around until you go ahead, invite the other one
Mikey Rocks with my nigga bumping in the whip
I be on another shit, so I know they coming with me
[?] the kush up in the air
With the molly and their body and they got em all touchy-feely
Take a sip up out the double cup
Cause I'm about to double up, triple up
Quadruple up, all these bad bitches with me
And they running shit, I don't know who to fuck
Don't matter, I hit it
The women in love with the women, I'm with it
They popping, they smoking, they open, I'm in it
My life is exciting, you love it, I live it, go

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
So now you niggas wanna act like
You got your girlfriend wrapped tight
You motherfuckers, she don't act right
Was sipping Remy with her last night
My nigga, I'm jocking, nasty
Fucking bitches in the back seat
I pull up on their niggas with the uzi
Too much sugar in the Kool Aid
I've got six cells and bitches on my bumper
It's resale and nigga, it's retail
So know when we sell, you give me the good number
I'ma have shit juking all summer
So what the fuck you niggas want, man?
Sweater with the gang sign
I've got an allergy to fake niggas
I could never let em take mine
These hoes be talking and whispering
Telling secrets through the grapevine
You can't shine if you ain't bright
So take your time 'fore you take flight
Ain't this a trip
Unless you wanna fuck with the clique
And I've got a bag of the dip
You could put it in your glass, we could sip like
