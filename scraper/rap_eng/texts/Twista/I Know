Gotta peace on my person while I'm lurkin' to keep you from servin'-

(Liffy Stokes)

Cuz we was thirsty go-getters that was gonna kill for bitches

Chorus

(Twista)
Fuck rocks and blows got cocaine that I got-ta unload
Got flocks of ho's all haters feel the Glocks explode
Like PAC I'm the mode Ima ride on these bitches till they bust me
Push your wig back like a dusty fuck up with toxic track cause it's musty

(Liffy Stokes)
Liffy's rollin that dro still throwin them fo's
In a duggy its closed with a lack full of hoe's
With a yak for two bowl's got Twista stared makin them hoe's
We beat the pussy up but still might spend a stack on two O's now that's a gangsta-

(Twista)
-Some say Twista's the shit and some say Twista's the nicest
Niggas wonder if a gang bang ever did I would be equal resided
Cause I got love for my Lords and I got love for my Folks
And the BDs, Bridge Kings and Stones and two six box o's and ohh

(Liffy Stokes)
-Can't for get my fallen solders Gee's that were sacrificial
I pray they rest in peace but I still got to do my thug puzzle
Too much weight on my shoulders niggas just dream and die
So we gotsta pull an extra seed for the one's who tried

Chorus

(Twista)
In the 'lac on dubs pay the valleys and I got in club
In da back of the club with a strap in the club
And a sack for the thugs and some ex for the bitches making sex delicious
Tax for the riches is the balls on my tattoo's suspicious-

(Liffy Stokes)
-Fool I'm heated and plugged one with them g's and them gurls
And them haters and thugs cycles like daemons on drugs
(Twista)
Got them screaming from slugs your mob is naturally fake
Fill the circle up with ugaly aguly hagaly ayyy-

(Liffy Stokes)
-I'm too sexy with a gun I'm too lazy to run
Am I too crazy to let a nigga jump off in his gun
I owe you one cause Mom say's get even
The war ain't never over 'til somebody starts breathing, BITCH!!!!

(Twista)
-Shieeet, you ain't known no g from the hood, tubule this but its all good
Could say your name but you won't come up on 3 state doe'n'wood
And we gonn stay on tour make our pace Ain't no body bang y'all weak tapes
Ya'll say; "Yah but now we gone" we gonna say; "the beat got it out, we strait"
