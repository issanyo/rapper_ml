It's gettin' late lil' mama
We've been at the club too long
Let me take you out to my home
Tell me what a nigga gotta do to get you out that thong
When are you gon' really make up your mind shawty
(See Twista workin' still)
Now can I get up in it from behind shawty
(Show you what I'm workin' with)
C'mon, let me take you to the penthouse sweet
Pull out some ol' school Marvin Gaye and put it on repeat
Shawty come and show me you can take it boo
(Let me fuck you first now girl)
Show me what you can do

(Come and fuck me reverse count girl)
Doin' thangs that'll get you go'n
When we on the couch I can make you moan
Eat you up when we in the kitchen
Let you get on top when we by the stove
When she told me to do it faster that's when I dug deep in her
Now er'time I see her, I gots to freak her 'cuz

Make her feel like she popped a pill
Got her feelin' ecstasy
Took her to the bed-room
'Bout to make her an overnight celebrity
(L.A.)
'Finna get up in the sack
And I hope you ready for me girl
'Finna hit it from the back
While I'm bumpin' ready for the world
I want you to hold me while I'm kissin'
On your body slowly
Give it to you like an O-G
(In out)
Show me how you work the walls
(Up down)
Show me how you work them jaws
And I bet when I'm floss and run, you will catch that drain
That's why I love I can reek it with you 'cuz you a nasty thang
I want you to hold me while I'm kissin'
On your body slowly
Give it to you like an O-G
When I touch her, she like
(Ooh)
When I hug her

When I rub her, she like

When we cut, it's like

Hit it to that Jodeci
Hit it to that Jagged Edge
Hit it to that New Edition

See how I do it to it when I sip some Do-It-To-It Fluid
Hit it to some Is-ley Brothers
Hit it to some Shai game
Hit it to some R. Kelly and hit it to some Marvin' Gaye
(Don't you worry 'bout a damn thang, no)
See how I do it to it
Gotta I sip that Blew It
When I touch her, she like
(Ooh)
