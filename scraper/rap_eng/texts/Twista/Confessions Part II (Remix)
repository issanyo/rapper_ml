[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby, I know we said it's best we don't talk no more
But I got to get it off my chest, 'bout all the shit I've been hearing, babe
I, I thought you were that ride or die, you would never leave my side
I even made you out to be the woman that I will be with for life I took in your kid, did everything that you wanted me to
Now I'm in the shit about you fronting on radio interviews
Do it make you feel good to lie, even though I know you wanna cry?
If you were gonna tell it, then you should've everything instead of making me the bad guy
If you got nothing good to say, then don't say nothing
'Cause if I really start talking, it'll be something
So you cheated, I cheated, so be it
We need to leave it alone, move on... [call waiting beeping]
Hold up

[Interlude: Usher & Phone Operator]
Hello, you got a collect call from Clinton Correctional Facility. Will you accept the charges?
Yes, I'll accept it
What's up?

[Verse 2: Shyne]
Sitting in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
But I'd be in the grave if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walking on this earth is
That night, I would've got murdered
If I ain't grab the ratchet and let them cowards have it

[Interlude: Jermaine Dupri]
Uh, listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Listen up, listen up, listen up, world
Uh, I gotta confess
This is the hottest remix I ever did in my life
So So Def

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(If you got something to confess to right now, step to the mic, Twista!)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 3: Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus Coupe
Your homie said she saw me, but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've been just telling you the truth
And I confess about the days
I was rolling my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field, still looking for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus, I should've kept it real
And I confess that just when I thought I could really try to get away
Or have another woman on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up with a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson
If you stay with me, then it'll be a blessing
No stressing, it'll never be no guessing
'Cause I'm pouring out my heart and these are my confessions

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
(Kanye, confess to the people, man)
But to give part two of my confessions

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Damn, how did she bring it up? How did she break it down?
Man, you at the clinic? Dog, slow down, that's your child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheating
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
And you know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous, you can't go nowhere
'Cause everytime you go there, there's hoes there
So basically, you and your girl over
And I know when she broke the news
You told her, "Man, don't say that"
Matter fact, like Pat, don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sitting on pay stacks
Things come up from way, way, way back
Way back, way back
Way, way back, way back

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (rock with me)
These are my confessions
Man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give part two of my confessions

[Outro: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do (yeah)
To tell you, the woman I love (uh huh)
That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know (yeah)
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this (she probably can't)
And hopefully you'll give me another chance (she might go)
