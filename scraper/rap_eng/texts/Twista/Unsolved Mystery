[Verse 1]
I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers that's prepared to whoop
Leave a body bloody, red' to scoop, poppin' off lead for loot
Shot the pussy up from head to boot
Just for talkin' dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot
Police prepare to swoop to catch a nigga on the runway
But don't none stay for the white chalk
If you aired out the tip watch your lip, because hypes talk
If you wasn't seen then you might walk
Even if it ain't the time of day these niggas will find a way like locos off of NoDoz
Careful when you servin' yo blows, because those hoes got the Po-Pos posing as hobos
Take a photo but please tell the Chi Town, he freeze
They don't give a fuck if it was DT's
They be up like the sea breeze on CC's
And they handin' out these murders like free cheese
Could you pass me the B please?
I got intricate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang
Bumpin' the dough in different denominations in nations and embracing' every word, because I'm slangin' the same
If you can hang at my town up at K-Town
If you dissin' them then you dissin' me
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

[Hook]
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga get put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Caught him up and wasn't wearing a vest, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Now have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

[Verse 2]
In a hoopty the shorties'll design a spot
So when they get pulled over, them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid, you have the floor it if you can throw it
And motherfucker it's a nine to knot
Just go back to where your thang lay
'Cause lowkey niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin' back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip
If you get the guns and clips to keep doin' what you doin'
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef?
Claimin' they ain't been doin' the bruh be givin it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then it's a blessin', she a lucky ho
'Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
'Cause you can't be actin' thug roof
Because of Hennessy and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even consider gettin' caught
'Cause when you talk up some shit
They gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at ghost town Windy City snipe
'Cause it's a city when hype for niggas wanna get witty
For comin' too pretty and be chilli filled and decipher
To pay the piper and bow to viper, twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin' hype enough?
'Cause every time I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin' fuck in fury, 'cause I don't like to bluff
If we ever get into it and let the static get to me
Let's squash it and make it history
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

[Hook]
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Call the popo the man and mess, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Now have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

[Verse 3]
Now listen they be kickin' hocus-pocus
I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus
So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see and base something you said then you better be ferocious
And matter fact I hope the dopest
Fore you to try to cope this is hopeless, 'cause my lethal rhymes
Is the kind that can beat you blind, and pre-design
I peep through mines like a see through lines
Check the brain and see defined
The reason I'm gunnin' I tried the runnin'
'Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck who you fronted because you was blunted
West side to the Hundreds you can't step to ho
In the state of emergency urgently the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit is irrelevant, they need evidence
Or trippin' on elegance they be holdin' out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get with him, here come the victim
He be shot up in his pants and lungs
'Cause he actin' hard and ran his tongue
Doesn't mean another nigga he meet in the street gon' be the man to run
'Cause a prison is some shit to see
Matter of fact fuck the talkin', my lip, let me hit the B
Niggas actin' like they glad to die, so if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me, just an unsolved mystery

[Hook]
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Call the popo the man and mess, shot up his head and chest
Put to rest, now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin' down
I heard a motherfucker crying loud
Now have you ever seen a bitch nigga give put to misery
And left an unsolved mystery?
Before I saw his body lyin' down
