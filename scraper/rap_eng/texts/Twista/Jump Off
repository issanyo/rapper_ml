Twista (Twista)
Uh, Yea, F5 (Baby)
Wassup lil' mama (tasty), you know when I see you up
In that SLR, and take you to the 5 star Terry
Its about too

[Chorus]
Jump Off (girl you can get it)
Jump Off (whenever your ready)
Jump Off (go ahead and let it)
Jump Off (yea girl I said it)
Jump Off (Boy, come and get it)
Jump Off (I am so ready)
Jump Off (time that we let it)
Jump Off (yea boy I said it)

[Verse 1]
I got a couple of stacks, I got a couple of sacks
I got a couple of blunts, I got a cup fulla 'tron
I'm feelin' buck in the zone, lookin for a girl
That let me get up in them thongs (uh)
Damn I don't know which woman to pick
When I look at 'em I can see everyone of them thick
They all wanna find out who a nigga comin' to get
Because the Hummer is slick and they want some of the dick. (uh)
Will you see the Twista comin' around?
I'm always thumpin' the ground
If I want women to bound
And I be runnin' with hounds
And we be huntin' 'em down
And when I catch 'em you know that I'mma be
Bustin em' down. (then I)
Run off (hot girls I gots to)
Bump off (who ain't scared to leave me)
Sucked off (she make sure I get my)
Nut off (and thats why I love her)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hustle mode I'm a cookin a brick
And a form of killer mode then im thumpin a clip
And a form of party mode I'ma stomach a fifth
And if I feel freaky mode then im fuckin a bitch (uh)
I love hoes that be ready to holla
When I pull up on em in a black chevy impala
Gotta get em if they lookin bottom heavy and Prada
And they want fetty and dollars, but they be ready to swallow (uh)
Who be hittin the after party we lightin em' up
And whoever rollin with me is gon' have to get buck
I need somebody I can call in the mornin for sex
I need somebody I can call up after the club
Come off (with them drawers and then I)
Bust off (in them drawers and get me)
One off (straps over nothin)
Jump off (when I'm rollin with mine)

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
I score the pussy like a touchdown
Cuz she can jump off, I'm yellin' "chuch" now
That ain't a bad thing, you gotta trust me baby
Yous a busty baby, you a bust down (uh)
Somebody you can get up any good time off the night
Actin like a fiend when she be grabbin the pipe
Smokin green while you servin the white
She the conservative type, but never nervous to fight (uh)
I got the head hunters thats comin to get me
Suckin on the dick until it was formin a hickey
Me and her be like servin the soda or
Mixin' the formula 44 with the formula 50
Skunked off (I'm crunk cuz I got me)
One off (I can't hear like I cut the)
Chrome off (I'm feelin like I got my)
Drunk on (and thats why I love her)

[Chorus x2]
