(Todd Nitty)
I got that 9 double M Glock, with the infrared beam dot
Aiming at your knot, making your heart stop
Yelling out "Fuck Tha Po" who some call it 5-0
Better look out for when they pull that kick door
Nothing but gangstas, thats all who I hang with
Slanging them thangs with, came up in the game with
The fucking hood rats, because them some broke hoes
Me get a rich bitch and stick her for her dough
The Manor in that K-Town, thats how we put it down
Letting off fifty rounds, thats how our shit sound
Artillery up the ass, scullies and ski masks
9's and bubble masks, gunning at your ass
Motherfucking street thugs, legit ballers
Money and the power, moving that flour
Taking no shorts and taking no losses
Hauling niggas asses off in coffins with that..
