[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Some individuals, look at the accomplishments of other individuals and allow themselves to become jealous
Everybody know what it take, everybody don't do what it take
I don't get tired

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Sometimes you, grind from the bottom get yo chips straight
Sometimes you, can make a million off a mixtape
Sometimes you, get to the top and them yo family hate
Don't give a damn what them haters say

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
I feel like I'm posed to be ballin', supposed to be winnin yeah
(I'm supposed to be lonely) I feel like I'm posed to be ballin
But no one gave me shit yeah
I feel like, I feel like I'm

[Verse: Twista]
Posed to be ballin, cuz a motherfucker knowin' that I be the shit I'm feelin like I'm just supposed to be winnin'
Cuz I go and get it and I know I be legit I gotta get it cuz I started from the bottom, product in the street I'm bout to kill em like I shot em from Atlanta, bad cause I got it from my mama, swag in my motherfucking step as if I got it from Obama, name always in somebody mouth, how could it be when I'm always blowing flames in somebody house, niggas change up without a doubt, if a nigga say he the reason I can't argue wit him now
A god-given talent and if you don't know how I did it, you don't know how I live it or how I roll
Get away from me if you ain't wit it I can feel it all through my spirit and through my soul
Whipping in the Ferrari is what I'm posed to be doing
Used to be on of the chose we knew it
Whatever you consider coke, weed dude
Cause I'm gon' stunt!
Whether it be how take em, cop and weight em or how we packin em up
Lyrics up in my room, got me all the way to Itunes
[?] it's at the back of the trunk

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Sometimes you, grind from the bottom get yo chips straight
Sometimes you, can make a million off a mixtape
Sometimes you, get to the top and them yo family hate
Don't give a damn what them haters say

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
I feel like I'm posed to be ballin', supposed to be winnin yeah
(I'm supposed to be lonely) I feel like I'm posed to be ballin
But no one gave me shit yeah
