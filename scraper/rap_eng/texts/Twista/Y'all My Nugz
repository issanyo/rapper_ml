(Twista)
Yes yes ya'll
It's the Twista in the house
Over another tracks production
Normally I would kick somethin about the ladies
But I'm gonna kick somethin to my niggas
Cuz we roll B's together stack cheese together

(Twista)
All afternoon them shorties workin the tip causin havoc on the spot
Bringin much static on the block
Half sacks cuz money makin is the magic of them rocks
Try to make em uncock the Glock with the weapon of potention shit
U know they hurtin in my section
Yet a hustle gets depressing laws on the streets holla at the chief
And still can't get a blessing
They smokin wicked in the hood
Plus the people is gettin blowed itching to come at ya stash
Run up with the strap so fast
You gone they be already gone cuz they coming at ya ass
Trippin when the pistol tap ya glass
And when they get drama they gotta call up some holsta's
But you know my homies quicker on the chrome
And if it's on it's on then my mobsta's go nuts
To the rhythm of a slow cut
Let me ask you a question "Is it safe where you got your sacks?"
It's only one got two packs a case of static where niggas got ya back
Some real ass homies you can roll with
So when the phony ones come at you they be ready for the thuggin
Slug huggin heat em up like an oven hang tight everynight
Drinkin down cuz a cousins

(chorus)
Cuz ya'll roll up with me everytime it's on
These straight shady niggas around my hood
Lets be the obsession so we can trip on what we smokin on
Cuz ya'll my nugz
We with each other till the day we die
Rather shakin up work handing out tips ain't no lie
Be quick to get the nigga trying to take all of our goods
Cuz ya'll my nugz
Ya'll roll up with me everytime it's on
These straight shady niggas around my hood
Lets be the obsession so we can trip on what we smokin on
Cuz ya'll my nugz
We with each other till the day we die
Rather shakin up work handing out tips ain't no lie
Be quick to get the nigga trying to take all of our goods
Cuz ya'll my nugz

(Twista)
I juss wanted to take some time out to say thanks to the nugz
Hit the dank cuz it's good
And when it come thank help me from saving me from gettin ganked in the hood anythang for ya'll
I know there's times where it be hurting where one of hit the lick us
Breakin some B's
Got the ace of spades breakin them trees for my psychotic stanky bitches
Acting janky if we making some cheese
Cuz we ride stick petty and smoke shit
Find a lane to toke with
We ain't never quick to come up on now yet run up on whether she wanna go home and roam
We smokin top down till the summer gone
Rollin up swishers and gunnin on
Straight up and chedda with my homies go hit the liquor store
We gotta swishes get some mo
Saving em so we can blaze em and kick it where the dickholes go
My homies is the reason fo
It took me some time but I gotta show my nugz I ain't no hoe
They can depend on me if someone's fist throwin knuckles and sticks
Plus I'll go get the fo fo
You already know Joe cuz if we fall while we runnin from the po-po Ima pick you up
Need some hoes Ima get you sucked
And try my best not to never let a mothafucka stick you up
Ima ride and I know you niggas know that
Cut the enemy no slack for ya lame as a jumpsport
Flaming philosophy till the brush short breakin up the hunnies on the wall on the front porch
And I love the ladies but you be killin me some time gettin mobsta ain't tight
Now put a hoe before a homies that'll rob for the dolla I'm yellin out
Mobsta fo life

(chorus)

(Twista)
Baby I see ya thick but this time fuck a bitch
Ima take my boy to pick out a fit
Betta yet I run game like E-40 in a click end up having you lick on this dick
Bump and size I pleasure neva coulda I eva be happy knowing
That my homies wasn't on they feet strong
It's like emeny g's but hit ya motha some cheese if I have to help to keep the heat on
I be down like that you know the lick
Reminicsing on clubs and swingin when you got moved on the emerald got you gone
And he's with her before I got you home
But we have came a long way since then
All for one one for all till I pass on the plastic
You show me love that last and not the plastic bags thats separated by
Caskets

(chorus)
