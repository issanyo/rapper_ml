When I get my money, (ohh)
We will never have no worries
We never had no worries
Can you tell our babies, We ain't never had no worries

(yeah)

We gonna to get the paper
We gone, We gonna get the paper
We gonna to get the paper
We gonna, We gonna get the paper
We gonna, We gonna get the paper

[Verse 1: Sir the Baptist]

What's the difference between a hundred dollar and a dollar bill
Not the ink, not the paper, that's real
That's why I'm knee bent and in these gators
Seeking the face of
God to get to George
I need my bills, folded it face up
Is this why you lace up
To go and punch the clock
You fighting time
The more you win, the more you won't stop
That's why the rich is suicidal
And the poor keep their dukes up
Pack a crowd
Pacquiao
You still a fucking loser

Paper get low
You do the best you know
(huh)
Work the block, I mean, Like all night
Back to back
Packing back and forth
Trap trapping on them fours
You can get your money so right
And that don't make it right
And that don't make it good
I know it cost for lights
But don't cut them off in the hood
If lights on top of hoods
Catch you up to no good
Just pray that Death Row bring you an angel that look like Suge

You tried that good living
Want that good living
Drug dealing seem so fucking appealing
Look how they be flexing
Make you want to give in
Enough to make a grown man get stuck up in the kitchen
Cook-Cook-Cooking up that soda
Bagging on the sofa
Sell it to some crackheads then move on up bruh
Bleeding hold your nose up
Needles make your arms tough
Between the good lord and luck, you on your way to church, say

[Chorus]

Cruising in that unmarked Impala (yeah)
We only out here for the money
Looking for that Almighty Dollar (yeah)
We only out here for the money
A nigga got it so I gotta pop the collar (yeah)
We only out here for the money
A nigga feeling like Creflo Dollar (yeah)
We only out here for the money

She only out here for the dollar
Dollar dollar bill
She will do it for the dollar
He only out here for the dollar
Dollar dollar bill
Cook the kill for a dollar bill

[Verse 2: Twista]

Twista
Money, money, money, money, money
Feeling like I'm at the bottom of a pit
Anyone want to try to hit a lick
For the almighty dollar
Do what I gotta do in the hood
On the creeping I be looking for a jug
Even if I stick them up for the goods
For the almighty dollar

Acting like you don't know
You was at the show
Feeling like it's all good, thinking you can live it up
But they got the four-four
Better keep it low or they be kicking in the door and telling you to give it up

And I bet they don't know
That is ain't worth nothing
It just something with the relevance of the dirt
They've been selling it since birth
And the government keeps telling us what it's worth
But the currency are the elements of the earth
But instead of it, we are cursed

And we never going to let go
Cause I gotta get that dough
Preaching if I got to to get that money like Creflo
Anybody got it, we gotta hollar
For real ya'll
Everybody living for the dollar dollar, bill ya'll

[Chorus]

Cruising in that unmarked Impala (yeah)
We only out here for the money
Looking for that Almighty Dollar (yeah)
We only out here for the money
A nigga got it so I gotta pop the collar (yeah)
We only out here for the money
A nigga feeling like Creflo Dollar (yeah)
We only out here for the money

She only out here for the dollar
Dollar dollar bill
She will do it for the dollar
He only out here for the dollar
Dollar dollar bill
Cook the kill for a dollar bill

[Verse 3: Jack Red]

I been fiending for a penny, That's a cent for a minute
Damn near dying trying to get it and I'm still poor
When them boys on the block, see you with it they gone savage
So quick, what you think we keep the steel for?
And even ladies stay strapped, no dildo
And it's funny cause the paper only paper, try and rip it
Just see how far you get
It don't even make sense/cents
But a hollar Hallelujah
For the almighty dollar

[Chorus / OUTRO]

Cruising in that unmarked Impala (yeah)
Looking for that Almighty Dollar (yeah)
Got it so I gotta pop that collar (yeah)
A nigga feeling like Creflo Dollar (yeah)
Cook that kill for a dollar bill
