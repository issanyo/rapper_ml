[Chorus: Shalé]
Doo wa Dah Dee Dah talk that shit behind the wall
Go head and move your mouth flap ya jaw cause your a shady motherfucker all in all
Doo wa Dah Dee Dah talk that shit behind the wall

[Verse 1: Twista]
(Twista!) Now don't you hate them motherfuckers that be talking bout I know you heard about it
And to whatever whenever the shit pop in the street telling everybody
Always into what somebody talking about instead of minding your business
Who be doing what and who got what going on you really need to go and find you some business
Instead of 'he say, she say' always talking that (blah blah blah)
Chewing off another persons ear with the (rah rah rah)
I know he know right out the door I hope he go old Pinocchio ass Type of nigga check his nose and I bet that it grow some more
So ho Do-si-do
Don't nobody want another person in the inner circle that as nosy as you
When it come to looking for somebody who got information I suppose he is you
Talking about who got this, who got that
Who got what who that slut who that dude who own Forgis who got work who got fucked and who got touched
You start a rumor like a engine and pretending to be a friend just cause you popping
Looking for your downfall like a fake but I know snakes is watching
Have a drink if you that bored even though you can't afford what I sip to some it all up in one sentence
... all you do is Gossip

[Chorus: Shalé]

Doo wa Dah Dee Dah talk that shit behind the wall
Go head and move your mouth flap ya jaw cause your a shady motherfucker all in all
Doo wa Dah Dee Dah talk that shit behind the wall
Go head and move your mouth flap ya jaw cause your a shady motherfucker all in all

Uh!! From here to Italy I'm finna be the remedy I'm finna get rid of niggas with feminine tendencies I tend to
See niggas gossiping like trending topics but watch them drop like a Kennedy

[Verse 3: Dice]
If any of my niggas not defending me with enemies and talking shit that mean y'all are my enemies y'all niggas envy me
They wanna be me like black on black crime y'all niggas killing me
Y'all niggas really act like a ventriloquist throwing his voice behind my sack quote ill he act that mean y'all fake talking behind a nigga back

[Verse 4: Demetrius]
A nigga back to give you niggas the mini mac I'ma get rid of any chitter chat and you niggas gassed speaking of a damn ventriloquist you dummies ain't saying literally jack you a Milli Vanilli act

[Verse 6: Julius]
Yo you could talk that talk if you want to but trying to get me to get involved what you won't do
What you want dude oh you mad cause I'm superfly I'm like Clark when he walked through the phone booth
In the beginning you pretended to be a friend of me but negative energy eventually will always expose you nigga that talk is garbage toss that talk in the garbage disposal

[Verse 7: Kenny]
You make a nigga feel sorry to know you a person you feel that you are really close to behind doors when talking will roast you then smile really fucking hard and approach you
Gossiping ain't a man's sport so I'm telling everybody and they landlord someone else's biz that i don't stand for niggas go behind your back like a JanSport
