[Verse 1]
It's the 17th
A week before the day you were born
I've been making big plans just for over a month
Trying to make this the best birthday
You ever had, show you that you're my baby
Damn, all this rain got me feelin something's wrong
Pullin up to my gate, they keep saying he's gone
An envelope's in between my door
Biggest day, got me panicking
What the hell's this letter gonna read?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hell, no! You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! You say you can't gimme what I want
Hell, no! How you just gonna leave
When I stayed with you through hard times and you cheated?
Hell, no! I hate to say it but I need it
Hell, no! Oh, God please talk to me
Hell, no! Your so-called love was so deep
When it told you you should run far
And not give a damn about me

[Chorus]
How could you leave me
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby
Please my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

[Verse 2]
Damn, I need you, wanna laugh, wanna stand
Wanna get just one more chance to see you
All my friends, all my kin say "Mo, just let that end"
But I breathe you in the driveway
I found pictures on the ground of our first date
I never in a million years
Thought this would be me
I'm trapped in love with somebody
That no longer thinks I'm somebody special, look at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Hell, no! You say you don't want it no more
Hell, no! You say you can't gimme what I want
Hell, no! How you just gonna leave
When I stayed with you through hard times and you cheated?
Hell, no! I hate to say it but I need it
Hell, no! Oh, God please talk to me
Hell, no! Your so-called love was so deep
When it told you you should run far
And not give a damn about me

[Chorus]
How could you leave me, when you see me
Desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby?
Please my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

Twista's Rap:
Monica and Twista y'all!
I remember when you said I couldn't get none of that
Then I remember when you let me hit it from the back
I remember we was young and sprung and steady talking on the phone
And we both kept running back to each other we was lovers together forever till the end
I don't really know why I froze up
Planning for a wedding but getting married is scary
Now I got you crying 'cause a nigga didn't show up
I can't really tell you why but I'm Twista from the CHI and I'm dying inside 'cause I know I really want you
So for leaving one day I'ma have to give you the answer girl
But right now I can't tell you why I left girl
Sweet personality and good sex girl
Fear will take a man's life. You supposed to be my wife. Goodbye, hope to see you in the next world

Monica's Rap:
You was all up under me
Acting like you was so in love
Always talking 'bout you a thug
Nigga what you running for?
Copped you a new Benz
You the first one seen on the block with it
Took you to the club
Showed you how to lean with it, rock with it
You was bold when you wanna get some of that
When you wanna hit the hole like running back
Now you actin like you wanna come running back
Hell No! Nigga I don't wanna hear none of that
I know you quick, but I spit that shit too so all I really wanna say to you is...how could you leave me baby how could you leave me baby

[Chorus]
How could you leave me
When you see me desperately in need of what we were before?
How could you leave home?
I cried so many times
But never did it cross my mind to ever let it go
How could you leave home?
Didn't even see if we ever meant this shit before
But we been down this road
How could you leave home?
How could you leave me, baby?
Please my heart is beating for the beat we had before
How could you leave home?

[Outro]
All the women I caught you with
Still I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Maybe I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women I caught you with
Boy I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
All those women, women I caught you with
I didn't leave, but I didn't forget
