[Chorus: Twista] x2
I got a new watch
I got a new chain
I got a new hoe
I got a new flow
I got a new Maserati no top, two door
I counting hundreds and hundreds and hundred bands I'mma get two more

[Verse 1: Twista]
New Benz, that's the shit
Model X, that's the shit
I am high and I be wrecking shit
Y'all are not I'm a pessimist
Can't touch it I'm too cold
Check the story I'm the truth told
City humid in the summertime but I be iced out and I'm too froze
In my ears there be glaciers
Igloo crib'll be spacious
Audemars looking frost bite
All the cars looking off-white
As soon as they look at the bracelet they face it and know he for real
When they look at the medallion and the stallion they gon know he for real
Haters ain't gon know what to do
Bitches looking out at my coupe
Riders with me ready to shoot
Smoking nothing but the best in the booth
They serve it to me like I'm in a delicatessen
To the chest and I'mma hit it right
Now that's a blessing how I dress it's just a lesson just so they can get it right
Now who would I be distress
Because I got the duty to be the best
And I got the Cuban with the baguettes
Because I got the shooters with no regrets
And I got the Agatha 1, 2 shit
Bitches all on my dick the way I do shit
Because all I do is drive new shit
And all I do is cop new shit
Twista

[Chorus: Twista] x2
I got a new watch
I got a new chain
I got a new hoe
I got a new flow
I got a new Maserati no top, two door
I counting hundreds and hundreds and hundred bands I'mma get two more

[Verse 2: Bendman Kevo]
I got a new watch
I got a new Glock
I got some new guap
It's stuck in a shoe box
I got a new 'rari
You got a low low
You got apartment
I got a condo
I got a new thot
Sold out some new top
You reach for my new chain
That can get you shot
Say she not digging me
Bitch you need a new shovel
Went from nothin' to somethin'
Frontin' to stuntin'
Bitch I'm on a new level
I got a new bezel
I got a new pole
I got a new trap
So I need a new stove
I got a Masi
I want a Bugatti no top, two doors
Choppin' bitch like karate
If she got bodied we kick it like judo
I met a new plug
So I got new drugs
I made it rain in there
They bought a new club
I got some new money
These broke niggas too funny
Said that watch was like eight bands
That shit only two hundred

[Chorus: Twista] x2
I got a new watch
I got a new chain
I got a new hoe
I got a new flow
I got a new Maserati no top, two door
I counting hundreds and hundreds and hundred bands I'mma get two more
