[Intro: Yung Berg]
Yeah, The Dream Team
Holiday, K-Young, YB
Let's get this money...

[Cap-1] + (Yung Berg)
Can't nobody put it on yo boy like you
Cause can't nobody make me make noise like you
Never knew I could feel so good 'til I met you (until I met you)
I wanna be... all over your body babe, all over your body babe
All over your body baaaaaby
All over your body babe, all over your body babe
All over your body baaaaaby, yeah (Pleasure P, talk to em go!)

[Pleasure P] + (Yung Berg)
Aaahhh! This patron got me feeling nice (so good)
Tonight must be your lucky night (why's that?)
Cause I'm a put my tounge on ya
Like ya man's supposed to (so I let her lick the rapper)
The way you tasting me, make me wanna fall in love... (I'm just playin')
Now that I gave you this business, I got you hot and addicted
Now that I gave you this business, I got you hot and addicted (Twista, let's go!)

[Twista]
Now I love how you be gettin on top of me
Rockin' me, I be slappin but you tellin me you ain't had enough yet
Hit you with a subject and a predicate
Now tell me do you want it delicate or do you like rough sex
Beat it up ubberly making an ugly face
I'm utterly killin em while I'm sippin on patron (patron)
Yung Berg told me he don't be rockin it
But even though she was jockin the rocker for fatone
So I'm a hook him up with a redbone
Cause I know he the one to get his head gone
But if you think that he don't be feelin them nubia queens
Then I'm a have to let you know you dead wrong
+Kamikaze+ with a black Mazarati
I let you know that you ain't ever met a man like me {*echoes*}
Twista and Berg, now tell 'em what we talking about

[Hook One: Casha]
Give me the business (You give me the business)
This is the remix (This is the remix baby)
Shawty give me the business - now that you know exactly what I wanna do (wanna do)
Then I'm a give this remix to you

[Hook Two: K-Young]
You can say that I don't like 'em
But I tasted and I like it (she's my dark skin, my dark skin)
You can say that I don't like 'em
But I tasted and I like it (she's my wanna get it, my wanna get it)

[Maino]
Tell me, is it chu, is it chu, said I really wanna love you baby
I wanna get that pussy wet, I wanna beat it, let me eat it, I wanna put you in that new mercedes
Cause she my girlfriend, so I call her mi vida
And she know that I love her, cause I tell her I need her
I beat that pussy up, I mean I put it down
Just when you think it's over, I spin you back around
I leave you feeling high, your feet won't touch the ground
She said to come on over, she want the business now

[Jim Jones]
Eastside thing I'm breezing through, pulled over I was beasting too
Like hey lil mama let me speak to you; I almost crashed when I seen the jewel
Hoped out of my vehicle, all black, vida do
Like baby girl what's the deal wit'chu, she was in New York from the 312
Lil Chi-town mama, in New York, you in in my town mama
To tell you the truth tryna get you loose so you can jump in the ride and we can fly around mama
You can tell she about her business cause her neck look like a blizzard
Try to get em in, but she was so conceited, so I had to think a lil bit more strategic

[Hook One]

[Hook Three: K-Young]
See I ain't never met a girl
That keep it juicy like you, you, youuuu
And I ain't never met a girl
That can seduce me like you, you, youuuu

[K-Young] + (Yung Berg)
Give it to me baby I like it (I like it), I love it (I love it)
Come get it (come get it), you want it (you want it)
I like it (I like it), I love it (I love it)
Come get it (come get it) cause she want it... the business

[Outro: Yung Berg] + (K-Young)
I love all flavors; how many licks do it take for me
To get to the center of that business baby? (first lady)
It's real talk - CASHA~!
And it's going out to my girl
(It's to you, it's to you, it's to you, it's to you) Baby
(It's to you, it's to you, it's to you) Said it's to you baby
(It's to you, it's to you) Yeah, it's to you baby
