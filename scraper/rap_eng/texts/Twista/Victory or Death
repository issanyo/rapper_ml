Two-Thousand
No motherfucking mercy for the new millennium
It's Victory or Death
I'm tha Twista in this bitch
Motherfucker's talkin 'bout styles and shit
And who bit what and who made what
Nigga fuck all y'all styles
I'm finna set this shit off like this here

Verse One:
Chitowns murderous mob gothic
Hard knock it give me the motherfucking ammunition I'll cock it
Respected like I'm one of Gods prophets
Gotta put it down for legit ballaz and you don't think
That I'll rock it? annihilate the nigga
'Cause like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion
Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed
By the heart I be driven
No shakin', no shiverin', get your shit to bleed
Reciting street literature; shall i spit the creed?
Who them motherfuckers talkin 'bout bitin'?
Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss
Y'all better run punk
Fuck where you got your style from I'm who you want
Rippin' the track and then murderin'
I'm in the middle of killin 'em off when the guns dump
With a young pump - two to the brain don't even honor you
Fuckin' up every part of you, won't even startle you
The harder crew of lyrical giants
Turnin' motherfuckers like you to microscopic particles
To hype to stop it - the module's on cruise control
Ride out on these niggas, bitches, hoes
Ain't takin no titles I instantly bruise your soul
Talkin' that shit to me triggers, vicious, flows
Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin' like I'm
Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin' convulsions
'Till I'm trembling no surrendering
Start shootin' and knockin' motherfuckers out like Benylin
Reminiscin' on that adrenaline; now you rememberin'
Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all
Gangbangin' like Gotti, rockin' the party
Straight up shockin' your body; doin' it kamikaze style y'all

Hook 1:
Cause it's victory or death nigga
Better stay out the way when my adrenaline pumpin
Or you can get a (click clack - blast)
Die motherfucker, Die!
Ain't no makin' me bleed cause I got family to feed
It's victory or death, nigga
Better stay out the way when my adrenaline pumpin
Or you can get a (click clack - blast)
Die motherfucker, Die!
Ain't no makin' me bleed cause I got family to feed
It's victory or death, nigga
I would rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin', because it's meant to be
It's victory or death I gotta hustle till I'm gone
...rather die before I can't prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin', because it's meant to be
It's victory or death I gotta hustle till I'm gone

Verse Two:
To all the folks and the lords
The bloods and the crips in every ward, lets roll
You gotta go - for what you know
If it's retaliation get low
When you get to the calico let it float
Make these niggas know when to go
Make a motherfucker bleed - for what you need
'Cause the family gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed
Luv to the Gov's, BM's, Field Marshals, elites and the chief's
Soldiers we better take heed and realize
Signs of the time, stay by your nine
Watch out for the haters and write your rhymes
'Fore the industry is set up to fuck you so you better be on the grind
Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert
And put in work 'cause time is almost up
Twister's, hurricanes, and volcanoes erupt
So we can't stop the struggle
I'm killin' my enemy, breakin' 'em off and not givin' a fuck
And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep; when I go to the sky
Thank Him from saving me form a torturous life of hell
But while I'm here I'm straight Legit Ballin' until I die
Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears
Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha
Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears
And I'm known to put it down for my city, nigga
And when we get full of the indo
Hydroponics and chronic lock up ya doors and the window
Better go and call up your kinfolks
'Cause the riders that's down with this mob
Will murder when the wind blow, won't know what you in for
We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin' in
And the only way we can survive is if we come harder
And strive to be gods instead of men!
