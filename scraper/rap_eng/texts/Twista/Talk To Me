Talk to me, that's the only way I can find out what's going on (x2)

Now how the fuck am I supposed to know what's going on
You knowing the truth but you steady just be holding on
You harboring feelings but you don't be telling me
When you be seeing me would it be better if we was hollering on the phone
They telling me you got a problem, if its a cancer
Maybe the Twista can cure it and solve it I got the answer
Too many guys, too many guns
Plenty muscle when I hustle
You think a nigga was taking enhancers
We need to holla' and get it resolved like gentlemen
'cuz if we don't I got thumpas' that turn niggas feminine
I'ma pursue 'em and pop one or two and they're gonna be choppin' and screwin' as if I just swallowed a bottle of Benalyn
I'ma just bend on 'em and get to dumpin' if we don't just holla' 'bout somethin'
'cuz you might be makin' a plot to come murder me
Oh your word to be, open heart surgery
Yeah you got on a white T but I'ma be turning that mothafucka' burgundy
I think it's a better way that we can handle this
So sit down and talk at the table, we gotta be adamant
Takin' a ride, and choppin' it up in the Phantom
As two niggas breakin' it down like a analyst off with the cannabis
He say, she say
A nigga was steady be hearin the bogus remarks
Thought I was gon' have to go get it when it get dark
We talked about it, shit squashed

Talk to me, that's the only way I could find out what's going on(x4)

Now how will I ever be knowing about when the struggles arrive
If you don't be open enough to let me see inside
Right on the surface of things you thinkin' that he's still alive
But since he been incarcerated his spirit has died
He's sitting off up in the county while he gon' be fighting a case
And I'm seeing the pain 'cuz I'm looking him right in his face
Never got caught off for pushin' a birdy
Now he gon' be looking at thirty for murder
Even though he ain't on the tape
Soon as he got locked up I had to go visit him early
The truest the homies and none of them niggas was worthy
He gave me my game and told me how bitches'll burn me
Damn, I wanna kill off the district attorney
The loser A.K.A. the prosecutor was a steady accuser
Of my boy as being around as the number one shooter
They sayin' that the evidence is a ruger, a steady pursuit
What it do you and makin' 'em disappear like the Bermuda, Triangle
Why dangle a weapon in front of the court that I know he won't use
Now you in deep shit
Now I just gotta go pay off my lawyer's retainer
Homie gon' have a better defense
And I know that you really ain't feeling like talking about it
You want your freedom and just to put it past you
This is the only way that we can fight 'em dawg
So me and my lawyer gon' sit down and ask you
