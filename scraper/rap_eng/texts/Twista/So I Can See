[Chorus]
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see

[Verse 1: Seckond Chaynce]
Seckond Chaynce, Twista, uh
Come on take off that sexy robe, leave it on the floor
Staring at your body, get you walking up to me slow
I'm captivated became a prisoner to the hypnotism that you deliver when you enter the room though
Baby don't be so easily offended cause I mean it will all due respect it's honor when I speak about you
But basically what I'm saying is that I've been waiting and praying and now I want to bring that wild little freak up out you
Out of respect I've been holding back, slow strokes and pokes I bet you will roll with that
But girl its a beast inside of me, and i want to show you that
I'm thinking that you would really get into it if you just go on and relax so here
Come on and take a sip of this love elixir, as I begin to slowly rub, hug and kiss ya
Come and give you everything, and licking up under your belly ring making your rain to the smooth sounds of Twista
Gripping your body now we really get intimate and when you get squeezing my head I know that you in to it
I'm pushing your face in that pillow when I got you trembling, I wanna go recreate this moment again and again again
Cause you done awaken King Kong when you put that ring on, fully giving me the permission to do this
And now the bedroom is undefiled, so we finna get wild and baby now all you gotta do is...

[Chorus]
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see

[Verse 2: Twista]
Uh, I wanna know if she got on underwear, lemme take a look at her so I can see what's under there
Rocking Louis all over the booty with beautiful hair
Her body so banging I feel like nobody compare
Look at the way she walk, to the tempo, of the instrumental, whenever she take a short I'm looking for one more
And I prefer if it's windy especially from the bottom so the dress' blowing up like Marilyn Monroe
But if I gotta be honest I wish you would take it off, so that I can admire you and look at your curvature
Creep in your crib and (Fuck) you all over your furniture, the (Pussy) evil, cat burglar
You say that you be the best when you dress but I disagree and if you take off your clothes and look at your body and prove it
Pick the booty up and I'ma lose it and never don't wanna be tripping about what you put on but if you wanna go ahead and get naked then go ahead and do it
Because I really like it when she in to it, moving around in lingerie like she was modeling
Beautiful face, no waist, her booty wobbling just look at her Instagram how many following?
She the one I'm honoring thought I'm a G, cause she blessed and where she go I'ma be
It's a test to see if you are with me, strip off your dress baby so I can see, Twista

[Chorus]
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see

[Bridge: Seckond Chaynce]
Turn off them lights lean on that dresser now because girl I wanna see you, peep you in your lingerie, slow Marvin gay, you know how we do
Bring fruit with whipped cream like peaches, and strawberries, and mangos to feed you don't worry bout these leftovers cause I promise that everything will be used tonight
Girl it's your night so lay on your back let me please you, body massage, with favorite oils of course so I can taste and tease you, i need you, thanking the lord for this, cause you been looking forward to this. Now but this blindfold on and come on so we can move forward with this

[Verse 3: Seckond Chaynce]
Ain't no playing or faking, I'm making you shaking and taking the entire evening and I'm giving it to you like a nympho
Ain't no reason to feel sinful when I get low, guarantee to have you curling all ten toes
When Mr. Goody-Goody come out the hoody, girl I'm a bully, you'll see it fully when I pully your tracks out
The neighbors banging because we that loud, it's a fact now that Seckond Chaynce could really blow your back out

[Chorus]
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
Slip off your dress baby so I can see
