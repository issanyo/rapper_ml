[Introduction]
This is Joliet Correctional Facility, you have a collect call from inmate
Yeah, this is Tucker, to accept this call, please press three now, thank you, hello

[Verse One]
Hey sis, let me speak to momma, who me on find besides all the drama
The system took me in but then they took me under
I suffer being another number, I wonder if I could conquer this criminal
Structure built to puncture the hearts of men, when them guards come in
The bars and the pen, I know I'm in hell and its hard to win, I stay up late
Lying in the dark for me, thinking 'bout the night the police came marching in
Its like they wouldn't stop barging in, asking momma what mob I'm in
Try strictly left us some scars within, fighting back
The lyrics of a favourite baptist, him, it's over now, can't hold a child
Mould a child, scold a child or own a child a soldier now, baby, hold your tears
Become a teacher, mould your peers, let them know its cold in here
This ain't the way to spend them older years, I'm over the fears of the world
No longer momma's pearl in here, it's all clear, them older cats school me
To the game, I'm all ears, no more rats or any cold beers
The ghetto famous disappears

[Chorus]
They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that your going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before
I guess that's what I got, my family for behind bars

[Verse Two]
I'm running out of time, momma there's, yet, where's my little brother
Let me holler at him, what's up cat, I got you covered, stay in the books
Them streets is a motherfucker, undercovers' posing as hustlers
Exposing the brothers, controlling the, struggle by any means, brutality
Got the police running like the enemy, our community need more hugs
Instead of the slugs, the guns, the drugs, got crime on, killing the love
The spirits above, drop a warning sigh, its only nineteen ninety nine
But all I think about is eighty five, them good times
Momma give us her last dime, icy cups, you drop yours, I give you mine
True love define us to divine, calling it on another's pride
But I hate to see you cry, the rain come shine, my family feel my pain inside
By the way my baby momma getting married, brought tears to my eyes
I just hope my son happy

[Chorus]
They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that your going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they made me panic before
I guess that's what I got my family for, behind bars

[Verse Three]
Ran to the phone, got a hundred guys like me
And all we have is precious minutes, to reach our people, our free
Brother, listen, be strong for momma, let her know
I never meant to cause her no drama, the pain makes my vain cry thunder
Will I recover my name and still discover how the game become us
Look how they done us, watered down our pride and drunken's, riders, G's
And hustlers, we got to guide our younger, there's better days among us
Never let the rage you under upstage the promise till tomorrow
And the C's just follow, won't feel the sorrow, for the misery we wallowing
Time swallowing, them better days in this gaze got my mind boggling
Oh, momma and hey, lady, I miss you and them ways you raised me
Them hard head things that drove you crazy
Realize your son took a lot of heart from you, it's phone check time
I'm gone, momma, I love you

[Chorus] [x2]
They run up in my home and took you from my world, now you're gone
And I'm feeling all the pain that you're going through, sometimes I lay back
In my cell crying, hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
Trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before
I guess that's what I got my family for, behind bars
