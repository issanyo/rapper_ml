[Lil' Jon]
Freek-a-leek

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
One that's always thinking of new shit
Any place, anytime she wanna do it
Keep her pumping that "get crunk" fluid
Never hesitate, shorty get right to it
I know that it's her when my phone go ring
In three in the morning, it's time to cut
Sometimes she like it soft but not as much as she like it
When a nigga straight beat it up
She don't care where I put it at, long as I put it back
Deep down deep down in that puddy cat
If you ain't never had a freak-a-leak in your life
I suggest you get you one cause ain't nothin' like a

[Verse 2: Twista]
Girl I love how you clap that ass
The way your booty cheeks move around when I tap that ass
She twerk it so slow she gon' stack some cash
Poppin' it quick askin' me Twista how you rap that fast
Wanna spit like this cause it is I from the Chi
Wanna get that booty up in the bed, thighs open wide
Every time she speak she tell me her throat go deep
And how she a freak a leak so I kept my eyes on the prize
Shorty work that, twerk that good
Pump back, show me how you cut back good
Suck that, love it how you take that good
Show Lil' Jon and Petey Pab how you shake that stuff
Never be trippin', she cuttin' like it ain't nothin'
A nymphomaniac, always got got fussin', suckin' and fuckin'
She told me next time better be sure I bring the sea grams
And she gon' bring her girl and we can all have a threesome

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
You ain't never had a freak like this
That do all the tricks and could do what she do to a dick
Takin' it so superb that it'd a make you sick
Can't even imagine who the fuck that taught her this shit
Everybody wanna know who the hot chick is
I was with in the video in the blue outfit
Like I'm a run and tell a nigga how to find a bitch
I might try and find a how myself, how you love that there
I keep 'em all to self, I don't like to share
Unless they determine that they into that
Being the man I am I'm a let them help their self
And just hope that I live to tell it, I'm good for that
Every now and then it's good to reflect
And think back to all the hot twat that you done hit
Or you done licked, any nigga say that he ain't did it
He a lying ass son of a bitch, hahaha
