[Verse 1: Twista]
Black diamonds, black mink in the black Cadillac
Y'all look at Crooked I, now look at I
See how I pull up and the bitch'll come out like all sookie sookie now
Sugar pie
Don't you want to get up under a pimp with magnificent lyricism?
Bad bitches with -- rhythm
When the women come to making their money
They only doing shit to benefit 'em
All of the tricks be happy when they get up with 'im
On top of the world after doing business with 'im
Hardly gone, a feminine up in 'em
It'll have 'em moving so as if they got the ventilator venom
And the cigarette'll get 'em in trouble
In the bubble I only want to see 'em rolling up the kush
And all of my bitches is thick
If you do not believe me, then just take a look
They spending their money
Cause I got the ho and she look too fly on the track
Straight pimping like Bishop
Cause Crooked to Twista is like Superfly and The Mack
And I know you think I'm bogus cause I'm telling these bitches
To gon' and peel back they purses
It's just a metaphor
For me talking about the way I pimp these verses

[Hook: K-Young]
I tell her fuck you, pay me
No matter how much green I have, bitch
I'll never fill your bank account
Fuck you, pay me
Bitch, my dick is better than your pussy
I tell her fuck you, pay me
No matter how much green I have, bitch
I'll never fill your bank account
Fuck you, pay me
Bitch, my dick is better than your pussy

[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Uh oh, here we go
C-R-double O, I'm bout to pimp me a ho
My deadbeat pops had pimping in his genes
The only thing he gave me since a embryo-oh
Uh oh, there she go
Now I'm bout to put her in a video
D-boys give her them rubber band stacks
Now I got dirty money like Diddy though-oh!
I'm a clumsy robber
I'm a butterfinger burglar, mayne
I'mma drop that jewel
Let me explain, I'mma fill your brain with game
But if you come lame, girl, we not that cool
I'm a goddamn fool
I'mma lean my top hat and pop that tool
Get my guap back, you'll
Know that I'm that dude from a top mack school
And a block that rule -- read my tattoo
That's C.O.B., it mean Cash over Bitches
Crip or Blood, Conducting Organized Business
Circle of Bosses, Cartel of Ballers
Cussing out broads and we crossing over bridges
Help a nigga get rich and richer
Do you get the picture?
When the pimping hits ya I
Got game from Mister Twista
He taught me how to rock like Twisted Sister
I, twist your sister
I, put her on the block til she get some blisters
I, put her on the map til the vixen bitches fly
Put her on a track like
She's spitting a written to the rhythm with Mister I
The pimp game's so ominous
And you know Dominick's not synonymous with monogamous
Nah, it ain't misogynist
It's a metaphor to tell you that hip-hop is my bottom bitch

[Hook: K-Young]
I tell her fuck you, pay me
No matter how much green I have, bitch
I'll never fill your bank account
Fuck you, pay me
Bitch, my dick is better than your pussy
