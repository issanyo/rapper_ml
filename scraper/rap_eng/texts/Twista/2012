(Intro: Tia London)
If tomorrow the world ends
In the morning the sun don’t seem to shine
I will stay here forever
Standing right by your side
You know they say (they say) that its all gonna end some day

(Bridge: Tia London)
So, right before it does (right before it does)
Let’s make love (let’s make love)

(Hook: Tia London)
If tomorrow was 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
The end of the world, 2012
You’ll be my man and I’ll be your girl
2012 [x7]

(Verse 1: Twista)
Now they be telling me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to Armageddon
If living on the planet ’till this point has been hell
I survived ’cause I am legend
What if it’s all about to be over
Then I’m gonna say you need to be my girlfriend
Hit the blunt after curlin' it, then
Me and you can get it in like the world finna end
It’s predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization
I don’t want to see the world go soon
But with such a beautiful girl in the room
I want to be up in you when the world go boom
Get down with your body ’till it’s lights out
Making love ’till the terminator come
Global warming is having a major effect
Comfort each other but we don’t know which way to run
Mother Earth is about to go through another cycle
And I know that is about to end someday (someday)

(Bridge: Tia London)
Right before it does (right before it does)
Let’s make love (let’s make love)

(Hook: Tia London)
Like tomorrow was 2012
The end of the world, 2012
The last day on Earth, 2012
You’ll be my man and I’ll be your girl
2012 [x7]

(Verse 2: Twista)
Tomorrow it’s all about to be over
So I only live to serve ya
The dark is about to devour the Earth
So come and ride with the Silver Surfer
Now will it all in from the element
Of ether or artificial intelligence
As long as we both have the passion
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant
I know it’s all about to go
So I just sit back and blow my dro
(Right before it does)
Steady looking at the clock
Before we suffer let me make your body rock
Having sex ’till the big bomb drops
Or ’till the planet go pop

(Hook: Tia London)
2012, The last day on Earth
2012, The end of the world
2012, You’ll be my man and I’ll be your girl
2012 [x7]
