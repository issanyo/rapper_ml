Whatcha gon' do when we come for you?
It's a stick up

Tell me whatcha gon' do when we come for you?

[Hook]
We came for them, now they comin' for us
Whatcha gon' do when yo time is up?
We was unprepared for this lickin' plus
We been on the run from dawn to dust
Wrong nigga, wrong place, wrong car, wrong time
Guess I was greedy, shoulda kept the shine
But it ain't nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Fuck it, ain't givin' up nigga it's ride or die

[Buck]They got us on the run now, in a high-speed chase
	Holdin' the Feds at gun point with no getaway place
[Benn]Nigga look quit bitchin', I ain't even ask for yo help
	You keep talkin', I'ma burn both of y'all and get away myself
[Buck]Man them streets got roadblocks, there's choppers in the ghetto
	Shinin' them lights on us, and them streets gettin' narrow
	Nigga the path I chose got exposed by yo ass
	Either get the ?? plenty ice and more cash
[Benn]Nigga shut the fuck up, I got another plan
[Buck]Here we go again
[Benn]Bust 2 warnin' shots to remind 'em, we still got it man
	Tell 'em to lose the choppers, and if they don't we pop 'em
	See all them cars behind 'em, shit I'm itchin' to stop 'em
	My adrenaline's rushin', these bitches done ???
	Robert Taylor raised me, nigga the hood got me scarred
[Buck]Damn Bennie, but this that real dilly
	And we done showed our asses like Mr. Billy
	Man here they come!!

[Benn]Man I ain't in no joint, I got 2 strikes plenty
	I'm finna exit on 51st so we can get loose in a buildin'
[Buck]Man we got a quarter tank of gas and a briefcase full of cash
	Back seat full of yay and the PIG's right off on our ass
[Benn]Nigga look the yay counterfeit, remember this a hit
	They was supposed to escort dude but shit the bank we done hit
	Man it's the only chance we got to bust shots at them hoes
	Hand out the first meal so maybe the rest'll fold
[Buck]Nigga you watch too many movies
[Benn]Fuck that, it's our only chance
	Grab the wheel muthafucka so I can aim at the van
[Buck]Man you stole a ride, sittin' on some shit that I ain't never seen
	By you bein' too greedy, this shit still all a dream
[Benn]Man what the fuck, you givin' up nigga I don't need that
[Buck]But in how the fuck we supposed to get away with just two straps?
	Now I could see if it wasn't no choppers nigga we might can escape
[Benn]Fuck it nigga here go the Nextel, negotiate
	Tell 'em what we want
[Buck]Shoot!!
[Cop]	Hey c'mon guys, I know you guys can do better than this
	Now you need to slow it down
	We gettin' the whole ? surrounded
	Got the choppers and everything
	What is it? I mean you guys can talk - c'mon let's negotiate
	You guys are goin' down, I mean what is it you guys want?
[Buck]We need a helicopter at 552 . . 
[Benn]Gimme that!!

	If they ain't released in 24 hours, yo boy outta here!!

Hook

[Benn]Now you see what the fuck I'm talkin' about, they offerin' us shit
	They don't give a fuck about me, you, or this Fed bitch
	Fuck negotiatin' with them niggas, I'm finna off this nigga
[Buck]Now what the fuck we gon have as collateral if you pop this nigga?
	Remember dude in the trunk, he don't really mean nothin'
	Look at the gas tank, Oh no lie, Bennie I'm runnin'
[Benn]You ol' fool ass nigga, how far you think you gon' get?
	Man that's the whole damn state
	Do you know how much time we 	facin'?
	Basically look at the situation, man I ain't got nothin' to lose
	It damn 2001, my shorty need more shoes
[Buck]Probable cause, duckin' from laws, used to be fun
	Now this'll cause us to probably to live a life on the run
[Benn]Man this negotiatin' shit ain't workin' fast, they need to hurry
	We could probably get into the buildin' but I sho' ain't certain
[Buck]Yo was this really worth it?
[Benn]That's some shit you shoulda asked yourself
	We in to deep and ain't nothin' but action left - c'mon
