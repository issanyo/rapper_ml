Never talk about or be about it, I give you the vision of a movie through the eyes of a crook
Put in jail for nothing doing to me and my people better put some money on my books
Spit it for smokers cause I know about dro
Spit it for pimps cause I know about hoes
Spit it for niggas that get money and do murders in the streets
Ok, I know about those
If you know somebody that gotta get down come and holla if you know they really wanna get a pack
If it go through, they gon' do a lil something for you for bringing their bidness back
Go head and holla cause they cheap, I know them niggas
But it ain't got shit to do with me, I just mow them niggas
Living good life look, jack city bitch, driving cars the be the shit, rack city bitch
Spit it like a mini mac clip or a Thompson machine gun, run 'fore I make 'em backflip
Will he live to see another day if you don't get immediate medical attention from all the bullets in em
Let me slow down before somebody gotta die try'na pull it with 'em
Chi-Town don't like nobody, Twista fuck that nigga
But if somebody touch him its on, he's Chi-Town, we love that nigga
I let the shawty jerk, if I don't spray your head nigga
Bath and Bodyworks, no lingerie, you're dead nigga
