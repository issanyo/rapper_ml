Hang out like motorcycles and on Madison and Micky d's parkin' lot

Smoked cars pound

(Liffy Stokes)
It ain't nothing to floss and ballI
Live a life that say a high price cost to ya'll
Jet set with my hair hanging out the vet
Doing donuts on the air cuz the streets wet
Bringing more rats
Sippin' on the finest

Fly as the nigga roll
Smoking on the Philly slow
Screamin' what dilly hoe
I got a whirlpool sweet at the mo mo
Plus a quarter of some hydro
With the rainjo
