[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I'm humble because I know what it feels like to be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me...
I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around, now I'm somebody

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get a heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me 'cause I'm nothing like them, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he's proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, "Wow, peep his salary"
Way back when I was feeling defeated (Rrr)
When inspiration, motivation was needed (Rrr)
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'm a keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli' sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listenin' to Witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirling
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's "Fuck the world" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista, I remember thinking I would rather die
Then go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I'm ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs, everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back and forth on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y'all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimping on everybody
And certain mothafuckers that want to get in my circle I tell them naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy, naturally
And I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s "Fuck them", I don’t even bother
And who knows what's next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Midwest, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in, better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level, wherever you wanna go
Everybody put they hands up, I'm ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up, yeah

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
From the back streets to the packed seats
On the block, running from the cops, like athletes
Ugh, whoever would've imagined Lace Up could've got me to the finish like track meets?
And when everybody’s hot, I'm past heat
And if I don't need the fuel, don't gas me (Yeah)
It's been a long time coming since 100 Words And Running
Mothafucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then you know we gotta have it
Don’t anybody ever snitch, get pinched, you forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget (Blah)
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby's mother
Never gonna know his daddy, tragic
Why's the government gotta lie to get money? (Huh?)
Why's the federal reserve gotta take from me? (Why?)
Why should I be fighting for another country?
Have you seen my city mothafucka? We hungry! (Urghh)
Representing for the middle of the map even though me and mine are coming from the bottom (Waddup)
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
You really think that Notorious B.I.G would believe these guys? (Nope)
All these internet thugs that the media finds?
You wanna talk about grind?
Look at me in the encyclopedia, what name is in it?
I bet you see mine, motherfucker that's Kells
Skinny boy, six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still, I came out on T-O-P
So this is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had to him was some headphones
So he pick a song, and he turn 'em on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape and the kick in the bass
That's the story of MGK
Lace Up!

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream "Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
"Fuck the world" (Fuck the world)
Screaming "Mothafuck the world"
