[Verse 1: ProbCause]
I'm back at the crib on my Chi-town shit
All walks of life in the same room chillin
Kick it with the new school learned how to spit from the OG's you could probably hear it in the twist
Thats an ode to the old school
Open these doors and your ears never old news
Midwest State of mind nobody owes you, don't let it control you stand on your own two
Now we the center of the scene
Louder than a bomb and we working as a team
Do it for the spitters and the hitters with a dream
Take it to the top with a full head a steam
Rush
So turn the bass kick up and bump and let the rhythm hit off the trunk
To make you homie kick up and jump
Light up the blunt to celebrate the shit that we on

We off the richter this Chi-Town shit
The City that works go hard for it
All sides of the Windy on the scene gonna mix while the murder mayor making extra change off a lick
I used to kick it at the Tip
If I liked baseball probably rock a sox fitted
Shoutout to Carlos, Hyphon and Ship
House, trap, drill, dub all up in the whip
So let me take you on a trip
A north pole bomber ima put you on a lick
A polar vortex couldn't cool my click
But these city slickers icy you could fuck around and slip
To all the homies with a gift, never give it up holler at me for a lift
And if you ever get on, put it back into the City where you were born

[Verse 2: Twista]


[Verse 3: ProbCause]
We off the richter this Chi-Town shit
The City that works go hard for it
Ghost of Capone in the booth where I spit
Nothin more corrupt than our city politics, yeah
That's shouts to the boss
Grass ain't greener gotta cut that loss
Counter with a park tryina up that cost
Shouts to the writers in the howard yards

Put your left foot in front of your right foot and walk with me
Through the city of Chi, where the vultures be
In the windy, breezy, easy does it cousin
Dont act up in public gonna get called up out
Understand what its all about
Tell GCI to bump this loud
Watch how I make my city proud
