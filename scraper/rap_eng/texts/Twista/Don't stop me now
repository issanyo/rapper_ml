Don't stop me now

Showtime featuring Twista

Verse 1

Showtime:

See a muthafucka came in the game so fast, came from trash, now I pull up in the range with Jag, I'm just like you so you can't be mad,  get'n my way I spank yo ass, niggas know I'm high right now, better recognize with yo gat right now, cause i'm get'n real close to the top right now so "Don't stop me now"

It's yo time, bitch i'm go'n shine, pull and don't squeeze get hit with yo nine, it's my time and if it's not mine, I guess everyone of you niggas a be dye'n, ya'll ain't live'n like i'm live'n, ya'll ain't get it like I get it, G.M.G. chain White Sox fitted, "Don't stop me now"
Get in a bitch mouth like Colgate, oh that was yo chick, don't hate, pull up in da bronco to yo place and murder yo ho like O.J., then I call Twista up, bring the Lambo and pick me up, i'm on a paper chase to get the bucks so "Don't stop me now"

The way we kill'n em can't be fair, say I ain't shit so you can't be scared, i'm in the hood so you can't be there, i'm so Harvey like Dixie Square, i'm a show ya'll how to grind, yo team ain't hot as mine, I'll shoot this up like Columbine so "Don't stop me now"

Hook X2

Ya'll niggas go'n stop us (How?), ya'll niggas can't stop us now, cause we the hottest round, from Harvey to K-town, we built this from the ground, will tear this bitch right down, we close to the top right now so "Don't stop me now!"

Verse 2

Twista:

(Twista) now can't no muthafucka stop me now, the personification of what Pac be now, the interpretation of what a Glock be now, the continuation of what hop be now, so them niggas wanna copy now, get on my dick and they try to jock my style, the key to the universe wanna lock me now so "Don't stop me now"

And I'm particular when I be give'n em venom it's rhythm I put venom all in a predicament that'll be cannibalism and I'm a devour, anybody, that I wanna, them I'm a strike, kill'n em off, one particular status of poetry and power, spit it on all types of rhythm that I know they can't do cause I got to much swag on it

Got the balls to do what you gotta do, what you call, to come on, we could bet a whole bag homie, I particularly cut em up like Dexter, stack'n my paper so call me the bone collector, Showtime and Twista will appoint it with the texture, hopefully niggas feel like they one of the regulars, cause booky niggas wanna cop us now, pussy ass niggas wanna pop us now, gotta see us with binoculars now so "Don't stop me now"
