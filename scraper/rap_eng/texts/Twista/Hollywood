[Chorus]
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 1]
They say I be actin' Hollywood
Why? 'Cause I be on my own shit (woo)
Split a nigga, don't quit (yeah)
I don't do no favors, that ain't logic
Give me my deposit, right a wrong bitch
They say I be actin' Hollywood (woo)
Because I don't be fuckin' with 'em (nope)
Because I won't do nothin' with 'em (right)
They don't know the truth about my personality
They talk about us just to fill in
When they say I'm actin' Hollywood (what?)
Sometimes I gotta be conceited (for real)
Sometimes I feel the people need it (yeah)
They all know that they be hatin' when they be debatin'
But the other people see it
When they say I'm actin' Hollywood
I'm just a Sagittarius (what up?)
I be chillin' to myself in my area
The steps are various to get to this level
I better live vicarious and when you do
When they say you're actin' Hollywood
She made a sound like the sex hurt her
Doors open like south murder
Niggas thought that they can take it to another level
I take it a step further
So they say I'm actin' Hollywood (what?)
They say they wanna catch Twista (damn)
You can't put nothin' past niggas (nope)
So I ain't fuckin' with these nothin' ass bitches
And these nothin' ass niggas
So they say that I be actin' Hollywood (yeah)
Because I will do nothin' to burn with ya (nope)
And half way to hell, I be standin' all over the furniture (yeah)
I have to ask everybody to walk out the room when I be talkin' 'bout shit that ain't concernin' ya
Is that why I be actin' Hollywood? (Why?)
Is it because of the way I can switch up the style?
Or how I can manage to get up on the baddest bitch in the pile
You said it, I be the one that one change but I feel like you be the one actin' different now
That's why I be sayin' you be actin' Hollywood

[Chorus]
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood

[Verse 2]
With the music, I'm never bound to stop (never)
They tell me I don't come around a lot (I don't)
I just be out on the grind, gettin' steel like the sign on the mountain top
They say I be actin' Hollywood (they do)
If I look at 'em like a object (what?)
Think I'm a youngin' but I'm just a polished Hard' vet (that's right)
They say fuck your entourage and facade
My name on the boulevard, yes
So I ain't actin' Hollywood (nope)
Not until they really care
Not until I eat with a billionaire (yeah)
Not until I make a monster make me check the bank account and see 100 million there
That's when I'm actin' Hollywood (that's right)
When I can help when people hesitate (that's when)
And change the lives of the devastated
Levitated when my mentality is elevated and re-educated
Is when I be actin' Hollywood (lights)
When I ain't feelin' like a threat to you (nope)
Just because you feel I'm ahead of you (why?)
We the same flesh and blood
But because I feel I'm on a higher pedestal
You gotta say I'm actin' Hollywood (I see that)
But I resent that (I do)
Even though I know you meant that (yeah)
I could see the aggression on niggas' faces every time I went back
'Cause they feel I been actin' Hollywood (yeah)

[Chorus]
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood, Hollywood
