Chorus: Don't be mad if yo girl wants to leave with me
It's not my fault your girl is really feelin me
I didn't even know she had a man
She said she didn't have a man
She said she didn't want a man
So don't hate me
Q: It's a shame, but this game baby
I got it in me, ain't no lame when it comes to women
I'm all up in 'em
Sing a song, take 'em home, make 'em moan, then I'm gone
It's really just a game to me

Bridge: It's a role I shouldn't have to play
I see the same things everyday
Do her wrong she's gonna play
I guess that's why she callin me-callin me
If she's yo girl she wasn't yesterday-yesterday-yesterday
Chorus
Slim: How in the hell do you have the audacity
Runnin up on me tryin to talk to me
Checkin Me
When you need to be checkin yourself clown
Keepin yo girl from schoolin around
You call yourself a playa tell me how that sound
When yo girl is feenin for me and she wanna be down

Bridge:

Chorus:
Twista: Girl never seen a dude this down and dirty
Thuggin but he thought handling business but he not
Plenty women always wanna hold him just cause he rollin
Claimin they ain't got no job
But petty niggas they be comin at you bogus while you clubbin
Try to take you for the women they be fuckin
Talk about how he always huggin
Hope I don't have to hit him with the chrome oven
But just because a playa steady ballin people steady talkin
He say she say get you?
I saw yo girl talkin
But to 112 and Twista walkin to the truck bout to get
No snoozin
All the bitches be in big ballin confusion
Niggas trippin off ladies they be losin
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin for a bruisin
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cuz yo kitty gone
Yo chick just chose me
You ain't cut like comedian tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playaz
Or three tone chamelon gators
You can't never spit fire on no cd and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me
I could never let a girl make me
There's plenty of women out here dog so don't hate me
