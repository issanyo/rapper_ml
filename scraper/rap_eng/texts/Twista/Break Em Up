(Highbeam)
Put ya guns down

Ya'll then kick it up in the club dont try to run now
He's saying thugged out
But back in 88 bust I heard ya plugged out
Thats what ya name and became and moved down south
Still the bitch you was in the city
Mo money mo cash mo hoes now ya sitting on 20
If it came down to it nigga fuck your mob
And if ya wanna get em all we can squad and squad
I say now who want they ass kicked ass kicked
Who wanna get touched with plastic plastic
I see ya standing in the path trick path trick
Now do ya wanna be around bitch around bitch
Cuz I dont give a fuck if the club on ya block or not
Cuz if ya step on our toes then its bound to get hot
Its bound to get heated all of us we got a SK and a chopper
Better utensils bound to break me off proper
From the 51st ward nigga
We all ghetto so while ya practice looking hard nigga
You need to let go and umm remove ya bodyguard nigga
How ya'll wanna do it
We can take it to the yard nigga we rob niggas

(chorus)

(Highbeam)

Fuck how ya feel nigga
Jumped in make ya drinks feel nigga
Tear the club up like the mafia till I make a mil nigga
Shorty shake something
The way you look and make a nigga wanna rape something
Standing on the side of me
Oh no but drunk at the bar looking like ya wanna take some
And if somebody ask how much my bitch cost
With an ignorant ass I burst like that and bound to get tossed
Reload this disrespect for that nigga
That'll be your arm and your leg
Your arm and your leg
When he jumped up like a bomb in his head
Lets see and we make thugs like us make bloodshed turn clubs red
Get in the middle of one of my fights Ima leave ya all dead

(chorus)

(Big Body)
Well I fell up in the club tonight
Hit the bar had broads on my nuts cuz Ima balla

And in our head shot rearranging ya frame

Chi town to the dirty south we gonna get ya crunk
When we fall up in the party watch the deck go up

(chorus)
