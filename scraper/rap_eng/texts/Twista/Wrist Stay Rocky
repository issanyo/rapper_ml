[Intro]
N-N-NonStop
My wrist and my wrist and my wrist and my wrist
And my wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone
And my wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone
And-And my wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone
And my wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone
I keep two toned stones sittin in my low
Keep two toned stones sittin in my low
Keep two toned stone, two-two toned stone
Keep two toned stones sittin in my low, and my

[Twista]
People they ask me "Twista, how you keep yo' style young?"
Rocks on my wrist make me feel like the Italian Stallion
I don't do much, but every piece cost at least five digits
Just use it as inspiration and say "He got it so I gotta get it"
If a heffer got a fatty then I gotta hit it
If it's princess cut then I gotta get it
Handcuffs on the wrists, ain't nobody out here fuckin with Twist'
I be flowin so you gotta feel it
But let me slow it back up so you can hear what I'm spittin
They call me Cocky Balboa, I'm rocky, come and look at how I glisten
Even without it my aura make me get my shine on
It's just a reward to myself for gettin my grind on
Got different rocks in the Jacob for every time zone
In the club boxin with boulders call me Sly Stone

Wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone

And-And my wrist stay +Rocky+, wrist-wrist stay +Rocky+
And my wrist stay +Rocky+ like Sly Stallone
I keep two toned stone, two-two toned stone
Keep two toned stones sittin in my low
Keep two toned stone, two-two toned stone

[Twista]
People tell me, "Twista we love you but why you act so cocky?"
My swagger up in these stones got me feelin like Rocky
When I pull up to the party, in the all white Maserati
It feels so good when I know that I got 'em diamonds that'll fuck up everybody's
Don't hate cause I got that there, don't trip on how I do it dude
Different color rocks on every side of the Rubik's Cube
My jewelry's screamin loud, so I stay cool and mellow
How many colors you got in that watch? Black and white and blue and yellow
Hundred karats on the iPod, hundred karats on the Gucci link
In the club talkin shit like I don't know that my dookie stink
White tee or the fuchsia mink, dependin on the weather
You wanna take it or compete with me then we can do whatever cause my

[Twista]
V.I.P., colorful diamonds and a gold chain
It's a motherfuckin shame how my earlobes hang
From them knockers, and a bracelet
On my wrist flick flick flick flick flick
Watch so cold, they say they lookin at the time
On the wrist tick tick tick tick tick
It's the reason I could pull up on a thick chick
So fine and her ass so thick thick
I told her, "Let me be yo' manager
On the red carpet while the ca-me-ra, flick flick flick
I could put some diamonds on them arms and have you lookin better"
She looked at me like Elena, pulled her sleeves back and said her
