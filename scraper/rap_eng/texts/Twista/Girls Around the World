[Intro]
Reloaded
Shout to the A Town

Shout to 2-90

[Hook:]
See this is for them girls around the world
They sayin it’s their song
Tell the DJ bring it back
And he could play it from the top

[Verse 1]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye
Salute it and balls
Little bit of easy make some jizzy
Old school now niggas throwin that weezy
Now I'm trying to see your hands up
Screaming this so song and tell your girlfriend fuck them niggas
'Cause I treat ‘em with Patrone
Pretty Miss Brown little miss fancy now
Gimmy chew and Gucci dime she all about the money
Tell them hoes the holla back now
All the single ladies raise your glasses if you feelin nice
And we can turn this party to our party, if the feeling’s right
Go shawty this your song, yep shorty this your song
Now tryin to be alone girl I'm tryin to take you home
Go shawty this your song, go shorty this your song
Said we’ll forget this night baby but don't leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Life's camera ready action
I’m bumpin’ Freddy Jackson
While I’m poppin’ the reefer beneath the sun ray
No gun play, cooly high
When the mama steady mackin
VIP status, standin on the couch like I'm Reese
Don Peace, sort of like shocka
So proper beauty of a soap opera
And she prefer Patrone over vodka
Give me juice and gin, it don't really matter 'cause I go in
Hurry up and get your friends
Sort of fuck like I got twins
I got ears I'm a splirt
All my people 'cause I got that thing
Call it white or call it words
Only spit em on the tracks that bang partner
This school is the truth and the flow is bulletproof
'Cause I'll be lovin to you, sort of sample
Throw back dusty and I bullet meet to get a freaky shawty use of a candle
Take it back 'cause the bitches bad
Take it back but the bitches but a
Take it back 'cause this the shit
Take it back 'cause this one for the
