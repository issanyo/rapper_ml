[Hook: Alex Wiley]
My mind's free, my time's not
My mind's free, my time's not
TV screen trying put your mind in a pine box
My mind's free, my time's not
My mind's free, my time's not
Magazine trying put your mind in a pine box

[Verse 1: Alex Wiley]
Fuck that shit, I'm like what the fuck is this?
Exploit my culture for some clicks?
Oh suck my fucking dick
They keep it lavish, keep it laughing
They keep you passive, on your tiptoes
Everything was swaggin' till you come thru with your fist closed
Whip this nigga's ass if he harrass ya at the liq store
Roll a blunt and pass it, only pass it to your clique though
I'm rolling hash and ash and I ain't bashful with this thick smoke
Bitch we out here cashin', come and catch it if your wrist cold
They wanna know what I know
They wanna know what I know
They wanna know what I know
They wanna know what I know
They wanna know what I know, oh no
Ain't it obvious when squad walk in the room
That we know something they don't?

[Bridge: Alex Wiley]
You will be cherished, the leeches will perish
The meek will inherit the Earth
You will be cherished, the leeches will perish
The meek will inherit the Earth

[Verse 3: Twista]
My mind's free, my time's not
My mind's free, my time's not
You can never see these dreams
Through one eye, like a cyclops
My mind's free, my time's not
Mind's free, my time's not
You can never see these dreams
Through one eye, like a cyclops
Fuck that shit, I'm like what the fuck is this?
Somebody told me Alex Wiley
He be catching bodies and it's called Japanese
So like I guess I gotta spit
To the instrumental when I'm in your mental
When I'm in a rental or a limo, didn't know that I was this cold
Loving the beat, getting into the rhythm
When I attack it you wanna blow about six o's
Either you fucking with it when I do it cause they never two
You a hater, so keep your lips closed
I know you got it Alex and whoever tryna stop you
Tell em' I said they some bitch hoes
Labels or whoever tell em I said it
And if they want it I got some niggas that will kick doors
You don't really wanna go there, I'm too defiant
Don't wake the giant, you better tip toe
Twista

[Outro: Twista}â€‹
They wanna blow what I blow
They wanna smoke what I smoke
They wanna toke what I toke
They wanna blow what I blow
They wanna go where I go
They wanna know what I know
