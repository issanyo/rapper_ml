[Hook]
None of y'all can hang x16

[Verse 1]
Hype! You better pipe down or a fight's found
I know you can tear the mic down - huh, sike, clown
Say I'm phony like Christmas 'cause I twist this
Diss and hiss this, I'm pissed, come and kiss this
Butt of mine, you ain't but a blind muthafucka
Duck tail, one tail, dum tail, try to run, snail
Untangle your dreadlock, I mean deadlock
I'ma rock and hope your ears get the point like Mr. Spock
Them sucka wack rappers whippersnappers think I'm new to this
I been true to this, give me somethin' to chew to this
Like bubble gum bums that think I can't hum to a slow drum
Don't think I know where I come from, dumb-dumb, umm -
I flow to rhythms of all sorts, different sports
Give me some pants with them hands, I ain't takin shorts
Tired of them tiny turds and nerds, absurd words
They think I rap too quick, 'cause at my pace they ain't heard words
But I know one thang
None of y'all can hang

[Hook]
None of y'all can hang x16

[Verse 2]
My style I kick, "You're flowin' too quick"
That's what I hear from the vics
I bet I don't flow as quick as you lick chicks
Please, think I'm sweater than peas? I flick 'em like fleas
At ease, and even overseas they flip over these
Scall, I break 'em like a fall, my lead stops 'em all
I put 'em in headlocks, dreadlocks and all
I'ma scuff vics with lyrical rough tricks
Tough kicks, put 'em at the end like a suffix
You better maxwell and get smart
'Cause I'ma flow and kill 'em and let the angels play the harp
I'm sharp, Tung, I be rollin like bicycles, I slice pickles
Should I say cucumbers, newcomers, I flip 'em like nickels
And dimes, 'cause nickel-and-dime rhymes I find from blind minds
This time they all wanna diss mine
Why? Because I let the funky lyricals fly like this
Come get with the lyrical manifest that'll be flowin' and I
Rock, they still wanna diss a pro because of my quicker flow?
You suckers get played like a piccolo
And I let you know one thang
None of y'all can hang

[Hook]
None of y'all can hang x16

[Verse 3]
Check, hope you're ready, singers, for steady ringers
And humdingers, bum slingers cut from Freddy's fingers
Slice, nice, twice: he sliced ice and sliced mics with spice
So precise, don't sacrifice, take my advice
Jihad is on the twelves turnin' giants to elves
Puttin' twelves on the shelves, makin' 'em hate themselves
Cuts like his, you lack that
Records were tossed, and then he crossed the fader like a black cat
Holdin' the beat like a hostage
Think it's a joke? Try to poke, then suckers get smoked like a sausage
DJ Jihad be stickin' cats
Turnin' 'em sucker ducks' cuts into chicken scratch
Get the catch?
Suckers' hearts are ripped apart
For tryin' to get with the god Jihad
Punk, that wasn't smart
Yo, ain't it a damn shame?
None of y'all can hang
