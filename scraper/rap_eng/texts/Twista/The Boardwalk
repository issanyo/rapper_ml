The Boardwalk
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea

Now I don’t wanna have to think about the slums where I’m from so I do run run where the sun come
To a place where you can feel a wave and go into your fantasy and never have to fear another one
An area feeling like another dimension
To a spot where you can see the stars glistening
Under the boardwalk while I’m listening
I’m drifting, I’m drifting
Into a thought where we could fulfill our fantasy
Without any negativity of us having some fun
Doing whatever we want with no corruption or interruption while we be chillin down by the sea
Both the wind and your skin so soft
Let’s go under the boardwalk and talk, baby just you and me
Then im’ma kiss you on your lips and take a trip and show you what we can be
Take a look at the sky and the clouds, you’re hearing the sound and feeling the breeze around
You feel the motion of oceans surrounds your body and nature be showing you how to get down
Reminiscing of what’s in your heart as you hear the birds and see a pool of sharks
No longer ruled by the dark and you know that whatever I spit in my tool is hard
Even though I’m different, I’m drifting, I’m drifting
Let’s get it
Now I don’t wanna have to think about the slums where I’m from so I do run run where the sun come
Chillin even though it’s too hot
I’m drifting to the du-wop, if you not the one then don’t worry none
Inside a paradise is where I be living
The place is like an oasis I'm getting
Under the boardwalk is where I’m chillin
I’m drifting, I’m drifting

Chorus:
Under the boardwalk, in secrecy
Under the boardwalk, graffiti
Under the boardwalk, telling stories
Under the boardwalk, my territory
Under the boardwalk, boardwalk

Hello my name is Quantez. I’m drifting

[Repeat Chorus]

Bridge:
Under the boardwalk / Secrecy / Graffiti / Stories
Under the boardwalk / Secrecy / Graffiti / Stories

Outro:
Uh-oh-oh
From Cali to Florida the glistening seas

[Repeat]
