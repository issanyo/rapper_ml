[Intro: x2]
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Breathe nigga, breathe

[Verse 1]
Oh, Twista told you don't make him mad
You won't like me when I'm mad, I'm a motherfucking beast
Try nigga, I'mma ride nigga, you still alive nigga
Gon' die nigga, gon' drop, cause ain't no room at the top
Walk in the room like I'm 'Pac, bringing you doom when I rock
Its suicide nigga, blood stains nigga, nuts hang nigga
Bust them motherfuckers from my black, mustang nigga
Yes I shot them with the pound, got them with the rounds
Hollow point to lay his motherfucking body on the ground
Now you breathing and shaking cold, hoping that god don't take your soul
With two bitch straps and a vest is just the only way to roll
Now if you don't wanna die, then I suggest you better try
Breathe hard, hold on to your life, fight nigga

[Hook: x2]
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Don't die nigga, breathe nigga breathe

[Verse 2]
A demon in the club, got them leaning in the club
Hit them with the screwed voice, I got her screaming in the club
Pull up on the sista, according to the scripture
I'mma break 'em off again, when I metamorph into twista
Shit, I'm coming with the pistol, when I gotta kill 'em up
Apocalyptic I'mma get 'em, when I hit 'em up
Fill his body up wit holes, and the terror that will follow
Will have a nigga hit the deck, when I send it up
Put the pipe to your dome, I don't give a fuck about right from wrong
I get in the club, a nigga be feeling so bold
But if a nigga talk shit, I'll go right for the chrome
Then when you come back, come and see me do it worse
I'mma shoot the vehicle up put your body in a hearse
Bring you back alive like the bullets was a curse
Making the drive or put the ride in reverse
Don't wanna die again better get up in the wind
Cuz a nigga kinda handy with the black four fin
Or I gotta hit him wit the millimeter nine or the rhyme
Either way it'll be a flat line

[Hook: x2]
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Don't die nigga, breathe nigga breathe

[Outro: x4]
You still alive nigga
