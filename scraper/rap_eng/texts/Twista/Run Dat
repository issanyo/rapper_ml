[Verse 1]
Every time I try to change, then they pull me back in
I'm goin' off, they got a nigga on [?]
I'm hittin' every motherfucker, leavin' none of you breathin'
I'm psychopathic and I put that on the Fifth

[Hook]
On God, over here
Whassup, [?]
Get about ten niggas killed
We burnin' up and hoppin' out
On you bitches in all black
Young niggas know what it is

Muh'fuckas better run dat
You wanna get money or gang bang?
It's whatever
(You wanna get money or gang bang?)
(Run dat!)
This street shit is deep with
Guns and drugs, the Chiefs and Gov's

Y'all niggas thinkin' it's sweet
Till [?] on the creep
Then you wanna talk peace
Oh, we none of that
But we let the choppers speak
Till them bitches all eat
All year, we finna tweak

Muh'fuckas better run dat
You wanna get money or gang bang?
It's whatever
(You wanna get money or gang bang?)
(Run dat!)
This street shit is deep with
Guns and drugs, the Chiefs and Gov's

[Verse 2 - Twista]
What you know about the possibilities of gettin' hit
Point blank range with a Mac-10?
Talkin' shit is gon' get you killed, I do you niggas in
No we can't hang when the strap thin
He gon' run dat!
I'mma take it, try to shake it
Aim is in the Matrix, he ain't gon' make it
Challenge me, too basic, he need to face it
And give up what he got before I
Do him because I'm so full of hatred
I'mma make a nigga run that!
Calisthenics, yeah, I said it
Showin' your resistance'll get you deaded
And the grave he is headed
If he don't recognize, it's Do Or Die
For me, [?either that or bleed?]
And I'm about to get it, I'mma show him it's on!
Now do pilates, shoot the shotty
If you don't then I'mma just catch a body
The new Illuminati, or choose a ?Goddi?
Break the party, make money is what I do to a hobby
And I won't say I'm sorry
Unapologetic, comin' I'mma get it
Ain't no sympathy in me, I be a G in my Ferrari
The flow is not a fetish, if it's not embedded in your head it's
Something wrong with you, it's prob'ly off of molly
And stickin' you up is extracurricular
Activity, I look it as testicular
Cause I'm talkin' shit at ya
Hittin' you up if I slip the clip in the
Bottom of the banger, you say you bangin' well
Then spit some literature! You couldn't
Do it, this shit you talkin' is
Foolish, whatever you wanna
Do, get it poppin', I'm comin'
Through, get to droppin', I'm gunnin'
You, hit the Ops, I don't fuck with
You, better watch who you run in-
To and I'm not finna run from
You, get the Glock and I want the loop
Cause none of you niggas is finna shoot
The question, ain't no discussion
?tuck, Belo?, it's repercussions
Or AK we gon' be rushin'
?through?, it's Do Or Die so let 'em know
