[Verse 1: Miguel]
Mami you looking like I'm just another guy
That came to check you, that came to wreck you
No disrespect, but mami, that's correct ‘cause
What's in them jeans just got my mind hectic
And I can see that you’re feeling my fashion
Is it cause I'm flashing? Or is it this cash that's just
Way too reckless? Or is it this necklace?
Wait, let me interrupt myself with message, see...

[Hook: MIguel]
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quickie
No bite marks, no scratches, and no hickeys
If you can get with that, mami come get with me
I don't wanna be loved, I don't wanna be loved
I just want a quick fix
Up in your mix, miss, send me your wishlist
I have you addicted, so mami come hit this

[Verse 2: Twista]
Now, let me get with little mama for a little bit
It ain’t gotta be permanent and you ain’t gotta lie to me
Would you be with it if I said that we ain’t gotta make love
But I need you to get this up out of me?
Nothing long and passionate ‘cause I got things to do
I just wanna hit the fatty then ride
Can I give it to you good?
Let me bend your body over the table and pull the panties to the side
Never no scratches or hickeys (Nope)
I just want a good time and then I wanna get up and walk up out it
I’m just talking about a quickie
So I feel it’s appropriate for the Twista to talk about it
Never get nobody better than I can do
Feeling so wonderful when I’m up under you, one of us limited
Then I’mma get into it, doin’ it venomous
Part of this making you cum and have an orgasm and start shivering
Ain’t no time for no pressure, we just gotta make it happen
I’m a man on a mission where the money flow
Only looking for some action, I ain’t looking for no love
On my songs or my girl, so I gotta go
A short time of fun is better than a lifetime of pain
So baby what you wanna do?
I’mma keep it 100 ‘cause I know you got feelings
You looking at a real nigga in front of you (Who what?)
Who blow sticky, my diamonds is flicky
I only keep hustlers and go-getters with me (That’s right)
So if you hit me, then you know my history
It’s gon’ be a quickie, if you wanna get with me

[Hook: Miguel]
I don't wanna be loved

I just want a quick fix
Up in your mix, miss
Send me your wishlist

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Mami I realize that I'm mannish
I speak a language of love like Spanish
"Quero fugir"
I'm so obscene, know what I mean?
Yeah, sorry that was Portuguese
That I speak with ease—please (aha)
Get on them knees
I got a penny for your thoughts if you know what I mean, but…

[Hook: Miguel]
