[Intro: Mariah Carey]
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I'm riding home in pain again, baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged in an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say players only love you when they're playing games
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away-ay-ay-ay
Like my friends all told me to

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high when he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby?
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?

[Verse 3: Twista & (Mariah Carey)]
Now you know I'm rolling Beamer and a Benz
And I'm dishing out ends
Why you hating on a play, baller?
Having better conversations while we rolling on twenty four
And I know you got doubts
Why you listen to what people talk about?
You ain't figured out why they call you
The heifer steady hating 'cause you rolling on twenty four
See how you money flow
You dressed in designer clothes from head to the toe
You are not satisfied then tell me what you looking for?
(Mariah Carey: I'm looking for my one and only)
Well, I'll be your one and only
If you give me a chance, I'll make a change for you girl
I know I am not been the most faithful nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spending to a wallet, fill a Swisha with fire
To kiss you lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a rim and a tire
(I'm looking for my one and only)
Well, come on Shorty let me make it better
We can do whatever, while we sitting on suede and leather
Feeling through the city while we rolling chrome and
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with you, I ain't gon' lie
I knew you was feeling, you really know your guy
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high
Let me pick the pieces up and put them back together
'Cause I want to be with you, don't wanna  leave you lonely
Ride with you like the homie, never no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only?

[Chorus until Fade: Mariah Carey]
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?
