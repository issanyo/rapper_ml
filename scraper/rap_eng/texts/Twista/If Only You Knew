(Syleena Johnson)
If, only you knew
How much I do
Do love you
Love you..

(Verse 1, Twista)
Tryin' to think about the way I wanna hold ya
Tryin' to think about the way I wanna freak ya
Cuz I really wanna see ya, get'cha mind over
How them bogus ass men can treat'cha
You should be dressed in the freshest of clothing
While I'm dro blowin', twenty-four's rollin'
Girl I feel like you the one that should be chosen
Tints like foldin', fingers are frozen
Cuz you kept a nigga floatin', plenty deep throatin'
Gone off of that "Love Potion"
Hit it from the back in "Slow Motion"
And you hold up a pack while I'm "Posted"
So I gotta keep you up to par, cuz baby girl you a star
I'mma hit'chu with some ends
And match yo rims, the same color as yo car
Cuz you gave me a place where I could lay my head at night
And you fed me right, when I got in trouble with the law
You bonded me out when they read me my rights
Even if we have a fight, it's you, and only you
Twista with Do or Die, when I flow about you and I, girl
I'm in love with you, and only you

(Hook)
(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
When I do my thang, help me get on my feet

(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
And you give me that scratch, and ya throat go deep

(Verse 2, N.A.R.D.S)
I could never stop hustlin', and bustin', and rustlin'
And duckin' them po-po's, goin through the same thang
I figure niggas and triggas get put through the same game
Get the money, the fame, remain, pain, cane
Try to focus on my main frame, get my name in the big time
Flip a couple of ki's and, if I'm bogus, I'm bogus from keepin' my focus
A nigga went to entrepreneur to get my portion
Avoid nigga like abortion, lookin' for more endorsements to put my hand on
Grin on, bad bitches to bend on, depend on
If I don't catch the paper chase syndrome
Sittin' my girl on, to kick a little somethin' bout a meal ticket
Gotta stay wicked, don't rub my hand across a meal ticket
Like a field cricket, will kick it
But we gotta stay on the learn, not to burn paper
Baby now you gotta throw me a lic, hit the shops and then we jump out quick
To the Benz, then we out by six, if you lookin' for my Adisas's
I'mma give it to you baby so get cool
You gotta deal with the bullshit and the full clip
That's how this life here GOES, if it's not cocaine my FLOWS
Will get'chu through the DOORS

(Hook)
(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
When I do my thang, help me get on my feet

(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
And you give me that scratch, and ya throat go deep

(Verse 3, Belo)
When I know that giiirls, all don't cum the same
But Belo, giiirls, stays on top of her game
And I love it when she call my name (Belo)
And she love it when I twerk that thang
And I love it when she give me scratch
From the one of my new Maybach
Cuz she's my perfect match, never met a girl like her before
When I was down and out, she never let my pockets hit the floor
You can roll me a b' to the head, I'm gon' spit the truth, Church
I could buy a 745, but I prefer the coupes

(Verse 4, Syleena Johnson)
Baby boy if you only knew, how much that I really love you
Ain't nobody quite like you, nobody do me like you do
Through all that we've been through, still do anything for you
Cuz you're my baby boo, and if you only knew
Even off up in these streets, you still come home to me
Give all your love to me, take care of all my needs
You're everything to me, my king and I'm you're queen
You're ghetto bride-to-be, just keep on lovin' me

(Hook)
(S.J.) Only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
When I do my thang, help me get on my feet

(S.J.) Ohh if, only you knew
(Twista) If only you knew
(S.J.) How much I do
(Twista) How much I really do
(S.J.) Do love you
(Twista) Love you, cuz you got my back
And you give me that scratch, and ya throat go deep
