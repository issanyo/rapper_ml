[Chorus:]
I'm trying to get it, I'm trying to get it
I don't know what these others niggas tellin you
But I bet that they ain't never true
When a Bredda fucked up thats wat a bredda do oooh yeah
Ooh, cause I'm trying to get in, where I fit in
Shawty let me know if you wid it
You know d business, you know d business
Iâ€™m tryna get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Yea hey!
I'm trying to get it, get it, get it,get it, get it, get it
You know the business
I'm trying to get it

[Verse 1:]
When you're walking with your momma, don't stop
Cause if you're trying to get my attention, you got it!
He soft as doctor cotton and table butter  but I'm solid
I'mma stay right here, suck on hella linen in this pocket
You want a square or a pyramid, what you're looking for
A hustler with some money or a sucker wit some F on his shirt
I'm early, he tardy, he hella churning late
.When was the last time we went down an ate
You like Berkin bags, I like glad bags
I smoke backwards, you smoke zig-zag
I got a fat dick, you got a fat ass
I could talk slick, and I could talk fast
Make you my forever an forever like Keith Sweat
Get you wetter than a sauna an a night you never forget
No baby mama drama no strings attached, no regrets
You got the Gucci good enough to have a playa whipped

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
What can I do to show you I want you bad?
Get rid of the cowards, I know they're only talking
I put you in power, you're fucking with some bosses
Then have some flowers get delivered to your office
When I come visit you, while you were bossy
Nobody be fucking with you when you like that
Them extra curriculum, niggas ain't go wife that
You fallin deeper in the twister, you on da right track
Neva nobody get rid of yo, when you in need of a real mothafucker
So I'm trying to hit it
I know how focus they can be
I see a vacancy, and they be aching me, cause I'm trying to get
Next to your neck, I'm trying to kiss it
Open your legs, I'm trying to lick it
I don't really wanna be so specific
You're so terrific, you're so!

[Chorus]
