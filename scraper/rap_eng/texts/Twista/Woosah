[Hook: Jeremih & Juicy J]
Lights low, get lit
Get drunk, clothes off, mouth closed, take dick
Weed loud, twist up, lace up, legs up
Throwback, look back, woosah, get that
Lights low, get lit
Get drunk, clothes off, mouth closed, take dick
Weed loud, twist up, lace up, legs up
I love a chick that can smoke
Throwback, look back, woosah, get that (tell her, man)

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I don't mind what happens every time
It happens every time
When you put that ass on my face
Feel like I'm 'bout to drown
And no help is around

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I ain't worried about no other bitch, you got me
Use them lips you know I love, you kiss my body
Way you throw it when you on all four, my goddie
Can you do it on the dick? I didn't know, remind me
Slip and slide you know that's how you get around me
Speed it up I see you want to test my 'Rari
True, you know we spending through this flip you got me
Cause all I know is fucking you's the shit

[Hook: Jeremih]
Lights low, get lit
Get drunk, clothes off, mouth closed, take dick
Weed loud, twist up, lace up, legs up
Throwback, look back, woosah, get that
Lights low, get lit
Get drunk, clothes off, mouth closed, take dick
Weed loud, twist up, lace up, legs up
Throwback, look back, woosah, get that

[Interlude: Juicy J]
Yeah
All the ladies out there that love to get high and get freaky

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
She say she like the way I light it, yeah
We'll roll some weed let me ignite it, yeah
Ain't no pussy like your pussy the way I like it (mhm)
The way you fuck me I might buy it (hahaha)
Rub on your titties some more, I throw this cash on the floor
You give me a private show, I put my dick in front row
Freaky ass, turn the cameras on, ride this bone
Fuck me to this song, I might take you home
Now roll some more baby

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I ain't worried about no other bitch, you got me
Use them lips you know I love you, kiss my body
Way you throw it when you on all four my goddie
Can you do it on the dick I didn't know remind me
Slip and slide, you know that's how you get around me
Speed it up, I see you want to test my 'Rari
True, you know we spending through this flip, you got me

[Interlude: Juicy J]
She a real woman though, you know what I'm saying?
You gotta give it up for the real ones

[Verse 3: Twista]
First I tell her I like my bedroom when she sleeping with me
Then I'mma tell I'll get it wet if I let her get freaky with me
You be telling her whatever you want
Verbally or with your body either which way
I want to get with you so come creeping with me
Through the corridors of the hotel on the way to the suite
Look at your physique, go ahead, start it off
Room or kitchen 'cause it ain't that far to walk
Don't be tripping, take that Ferrogamo off
Look at you naked, just for a second
Then take off our clothes then go to the bed
Then lay on my back, 'cause I heard you be the shit
So come show me what you can do with the dick
I lick on that pussy, all up in the crack
How we be on each other, we got an energy
The way we freak on each other, we got a chemistry
I have you kiss on my body, I'll have you licking me
All I can say is that fucking you is the shit to me

[Bridge: Jeremih]
I ain't worried about no other bitch you got me
Use them lips, you know I love you, kiss my body
Way you throw it when you on all four, my goddie
Can you do it on the dick? I didn't know, remind me
Slip and slide, you know that's how you get around me
Speed it up, I see you want to test my 'Rari
True, you know we spending through this flip, you got me
'Cause all I know is fucking you the shit
