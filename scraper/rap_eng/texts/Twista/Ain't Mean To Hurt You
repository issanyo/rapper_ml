I ain't mean to hurt you girl That was never meant to be my intentions I ain't do it on purpose girl I just had to take a while to handle my bizness No more neglecting girl You my best friend and you know how we do Tripping on me cause I'm in another city But when I come back home, baby I wanna see you I could cop that Gucci you still say that ain't enough I could give you money for your hair and your nails Just still tripping start acting up Why you think I'm lying? I'm on the radio, fuck the rumors Sick of hearding you a pitiful maneuvers The one I make you say where didy go to... I just gotta go and do a video with Future I know it's hard to forgive and forget About the time that you saw me with a girl in the car You think I'm fucking everybody But I be on the grind when I be up in the world I'm a star, I want you to be a part of my astrology Cause I had to learn that you was a part of me So I hope you accept my apology, So I wanna say, baby I'm sorry

Whoa, I play them speakers People we develop hear my voice Ain't even see my face I'm on the paper chase I got you round my chase, I got you in my plans I let you blow them bands You my biggest fan When them thang I did You were just like my twin When I'm lying to you It's like I'm lying to my friends You ain't gonna never leave It ain't what I tell myself No matter how much I fucked up I got your back to deal What is love with a nigga with a heart of steel Ain't got no trust for no hoe That's how I live When it's bout the crib And got an extra condo I couldn't tell you bout the stripper That was going psycho

[Chorus: x2] I ain't mean to hurt you girl I ain't mean to hurt you girl I ain't mean to hurt you girl I ain't mean to hurt you now Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl I ain't mean to hurt you babe I ain't mean to hurt you now Now, I ain't mean to hurt you girl I shouldn't have lie to you, I din't even wanna say bye to you You know your nigga ride babe I even feel the past babe I'm gonna get it, yes I will
