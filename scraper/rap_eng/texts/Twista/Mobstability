Nineteen-ninety-muthafuckin'-eight
Mobsta elite's back up in this muthafuck 'em (Bitch)
And we airin' out all you playa-hatin-lame-ass niggas
And we on this laid-back track, something smooth
Eh yo, Mayz, whatcha don' do, kick it

[Mayz]
And ride on, niggas get your high on
While we pump this shit to vibe on
The muthafuckin' mobsta elite'll leave you breathless
When we hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the Chevy Caprice
I'm hurtin', so I'm thinkin of ways to gettin' paid
Cheddar in a bundle, fifties and hundreds and G stacks
If I could just hit that big lick I could relax
And ease back off of thuggin' and stick to hustlin'
Concentrate on paper and let the shorties do the bustin'
While I motivate on power moves, you live be coward rules
Singing the blues while I pack shit that'll knock you out your shoes
Cause I'm a fool playing the game of the streets
Claiming elites, making sure my family eats
We roll and it flees, bunkin' niggas out of their seats
While mobbin' on beats, soon niggas can't back down or retreat
Preventing mine, just doing petty crimes, I'm not petty or nice
Standin' in line, calmly waitin' on my time to shine
Cause when I shine, I'mma glisten
As all the heads come up missing
I'mma slide in and assume the position
My mom's stick thick, who the killas and convicts
Bulletproof now, pistol holsters under the arm pits
Ready to go out in the blaze of glory
Standin' firm on the deck makin' the front-page story

[Hook]
When your mobs' at your side and they're ready to ride, nigga
(Nigga, that's mobstability)
And when you go from movin' O's to keys for more cheese
(Fool, that's mobstability)
And when it's money over bitches cause you're stackin' your riches
(Playa, that's mobstability)
Gettin' your mind right for payin' for the year 2G
(Gotsta be mobstability)

[Liffy Stokes]
I heard a raw beat, somebody told me the funk did it
But if Trax didn't do it I can't fuck it
Cause it's a family thang
You know Chi-Town's the motherland of the wild
The chain of mobsters and gangs
But we're the elite few that just can't be contained
Tippin' only the plane, determine it's about the game
Like a playa stays the same, ain't tryin' to act strange to change
Cause the more paper you got, the more you got to slang
And there's more haters to bang cause they all want a piece
You got to be slick as grease cause they want the playas deceased
Restin' in peace
But my motto's simply too tight for you to threaten my life
With a knife, gun or mic
You don't really wanna fight so just swallow your pride
Before I come inside your crib and kidnap the shorty and bride
Every nigga alive wish he had a psycho status
Will your punks ready to ride so the bitches can come at us
In the city of thugs, police, politicians and drugs
If they ain't passin' the bubble, niggas carry a grudge, but no love
So I don't give a muthafuck if you killin' me
I'm pissin' out headshots, protestin' my mobstability

[Hook]

[Twista]
If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right
So I circle the block strapped
Watching the workers while they circle muthafuckas at night
They work to tippin' me cause dope fiends ain't wangers
These wanches are skanches, this ain't just how the cracks and hiatus
My crew react tamers than sweat hogs, to protect that (?) bomb
But no teflon, your flesh was tearin', for the love of this heron
I bare arms and I'm quick to snatch cards to those who react hard
Don't judge these, got you robbed, I'mma get more cheddar for my black mob
My legion is broke down into sections to run every regions
Slugs and thugs, rifles for rifles cause we walk every season
Having shootin' apartments, cars with hidden compartments for po-pos
Zip polos holding pistolos and mobstas know those
Sooner then booted, looted then zooted, (?) shoes so can I
Automatics but semi, then I, watches your midnight
Cause I be handlin' my function when the nine-milliter get to jumpin'
Dumpin' on niggas who claimin' my muthafuckas ain't worth for nothin'
I'm bustin', how's game I peep when I was a shorty
Having big dreams on money, cars and bitches by the time I reach forty
Nation affiliation, dummy paper-chase and willin'
For pay probabilities only seen through mobtability, feelin' me
