[Verse 1: Twista]
My mental complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
MCs evacuate when I activate raps of fate
Brain masturbates to ejaculate shit that decapitates
Niggas backs will break when I captivate
I'm strapped with hate when I'm at the plate
To fly motherfuckers' heads over the gate
Beat MCs at ease in a breeze, freeze 'em at 3 degrees
Flow deities, niggas don't got the key to these, ease
Over the shit that I'm busting, discussing us
And verbal dusting, I'm crushing guts and nuts
And leavin' niggas disgusted
When I'm thrusting like rockets I pull eyes out sockets
Put a clip to my lip and cock it for punks without a pocket
Top it, I'm too hyped to stop it, you're too microscopic
I dwell in the chamber like toxic
On point as if a sniper pops it, rhythms get optic
Are you ready for emergency surgery, verbally
For accusing me of flow burglary, third degree
Hotter than red devil niggas get burnt
Ruin the mothafuckas blessings until a lesson's learned
You earned the right to lose teeth if beef was instilled
Can it possibly build? I don't know but animosity kills

[Hook]
On stages and in cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
And Berettas tormenting, fuck representing, we campaigning
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)
Before the conflict, make sure you know just what you're gaining
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (animosity kills)
Speedknots, bomb shit, straight leaving competitors hanging
(So ill) Take 'em down, ugh (agony kills)

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's your funeral, so order some flowers from the florist
I'm turning the hardest chumps into bigger gumps than Forrest
You can't ignore this, vocals get omnivorous, catch rigor mortis
The trigger for this is the chorus, my guns are cordless, oris
My strategy's agony, make a scar that'll be tragedy
The majesty leaves niggas dead as car batteries, them raggedy
Rappers get ripped when the mic marauder chokes
Thinkin' tomorrow's hope, but death is in your horoscope
When my horror scopes, pages travel space ages, stages
I work 'em wise, when hype is on microphones I circumcise
Then hurt them thighs over bitches physical composition
Competition gets dismissed if listed as opposition
My mission's position is dissing
Take a hit of this, rather hit or miss
I still could split a wrist like a clitoris 'cause I injure this
I beat just to make agony bleed out
And me lose I doubt it, so if I'm in your path nigga reroute it
How'd it happen to my crew is what's said when I scare a staff
I tear in half motherfuckas with every paragraph
Sit there and laugh, 'cause you can't bear the wrath
As tragedy builds animosity and agony kills

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Twista]
I slay rappers of simplicity, it ain't shit to me
Get with me, I take the victory, you must not know my history
Sniff the scent of the magnificent, I done killed niggas in battles
Then when they come back with seconds I'm on some different shit
My prototype shows that I explode like Dolemite when I hold the mic
Niggas that test might as well throw the fight, my flow's that strike
Range from passionate to blasting it with yo ass in it
On the stage is where I let your casket sit, fast as shit
Coming through like a prowler, punks I devour
Testing me is worse than hiding from Norman Bates in the shower
Horror y'all, causing a fucking bloody waterfall
Only way I see competition is if you brought a ball
I slaughter all, pull your crew members just on a call
Plus admission but if you keep dissing we just gotta brawl
So what's the call?
If you let animosity build, tragedy will
And through defeat is when agony kills
