[Chorus - Twista]
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing

[Verse - Twista]
It's the nigga name Twist from the Chi dat came to do or die fittin' the spit the shit
Wit a nigga named Stack$ he catch a weird shy every time when he spit dat shit
'06 wit the candy paint, ain't no need for a nigga sayin it ain't
Shit on everybody in the face sayin' he won in the game like O'Neal when he stay in the paint
From Chi to the South, gotta get dat dust, gotta keep the haters talkin' when I pull up
If it get me high gotta get dat stuff, soon as it come out gotta get dat truck
When we pulled up to the club shitted on 'em all, fittin' to ball from the VIP
It's Twista and Stack$ let me tell you a little about how a "G" I be

[Bridge - Twista]
Gotta keep it pimpish nigga
Let's do it how the ballas do, pull a girl like a playa do
Do it like shot callas do
Take a ride on the block
If you don't like hard tops den let's drop these racks
Gotta do it way big, take a trip to the mall
Spending stacks fin to pop these tags

[Chorus - Twista]
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing

[Verse - Stack$]
What I wrote so dope dat I rope a dope
6 miles around you cause yo flows a joke
When I spit dis shit you can get everything out my lips, plus the mucus kid
Hi ma, how you doing? Have you seen me
With dat black drop Rolls dat they don't make yet?
Pull up to the spot, chicks get in
See it's VIP when me and Twist step in
Girl I hit, hit, and hit again
Have you say "goddamn the rest should quit"
Flip the switch watch me and Twist and how we spit
Pimp to a bitch in 6 minutes
We infinite, you finish quick
Wanna mess one time den you missin' limbs
Pull a betta ride den you seen on Cribs
Tell 'em what we keep now

[Bridge - Twista]
Gotta keep it pimpish nigga
Let's do it how the ballas do, pull a girl like a playa do
Do it like shot callas do
Take a ride on the block
If you don't like hard tops den let's drop these racks
Gotta do it way big, take a trip to the mall
Spending stacks fin to pop these tags

[Chorus - Twista]
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing

[Bridge 2 -Twista]
Come listen to the niggas dat be taken over
In the city in a cherry Range Rover
It's the big money maker, high roller
Come and look in the eyes of the beholder
Gotta spit it for the soldiers
Gotta spit it for the playas
Gotta spit it for my niggas
Gotta spit it for the haters

[Verse - Stack$]
Dis my anthem, dis my theme
Look at my pinky, look at my ring
My party stay jumpin' like a trampoline
Gotta candy coated Chevy colored tangerine
I'm a S-O-B to the E, started out here, tough to believe
Kush in the air so it's tough to breathe
And we live like kings so it's hard to leave
And 'em boyz down here know what I mean
Got a Bentley on my wrist when I hit the scene
Never hot, never cold, more in between
Gotta stay so fresh like Listerine
Bodean got plays like Wolverine
Cuz the boyz stay stackin' those collard greens
On the top of the world, mean literally
Guess dat's why my team reigns supreme

[Chorus - Twista]
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you pop that thing
Git it, git it, git it, git it girl let me see you drop that thing
