[Intro: sample]
Sharks in the dunk tank, vipers in the garden

[Hook: Tay-K]
Smoking big dope with Rilla Killa
If a nigga try me, i'mma kill'em
In my city I'm a villain

[Verse 1: Pimpyz]
Yes, my nigga, I am a villain
Shoutout to my nigga Dallas, he always be dealin'
Chillin by the ocean
Post came through sippin purple potion

[Verse 2: Rilla Killa]
I'm a super villain sippin super drank
Pimpyz got a Glock, finna drive by in a tank
Drug dealing bad guys in a QP of that dank
When I'm smoking on is green, that's when I mutate
Put you haters under me, and yo bitch on top of me
I do this shit so easily
These motherfuckers weaklings
Turned the safety off the flow, did not reload
Gun in a mask call me young deathstroke
I'm a killer like OJ, smokin on propane
Motherfuckers lookin old like they need some Rogaine
Bitch on my line, lookin for some cocaine
Tony Montana coke whiter than a snowflake
Yuh, it's ? the snowman, motherfuckers know that I'm chillin
R.I.P. to all the blunts I'm killin
Dope boys shit Rilla Killa just a villain

[Hook: Tay-K]
Smoking big dope with Rilla Killa
If a nigga try me, i'mma kill em
In my city I'm a villain

[Outro: Tay-K]
Smoking big dope with Rilla Killa
If a nigga try me, i'mma kill em
In my city nigga, I'm a villain
