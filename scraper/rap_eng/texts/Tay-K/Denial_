[Verse: Tay-K]
Sippin' up purple like Spyro
She say she ain't heard from Tay-K in a while
The image on my tee is a crocodile
I think it's the Xanny that made me hostile
I am the youth, but I am not a child
Rugrat, and I cannot help that I'm wild
Catch a case and don't show up to the trial
When I make it big, I'll remember denial

[Chorus]
I knew you all
