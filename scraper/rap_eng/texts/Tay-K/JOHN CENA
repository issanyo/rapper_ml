[Intro]
Let's get it

[Verse 1: Tay-K]
Bling, bling,  bling, pinky ring fiend
Newport Boyz smoke focus with me
Scott peeled off in a coff, R.I.P
Fuck the opps singing in the station like Glee
Heartbeat racing, you a pussy low-key
Put this TEC to your neck, where the fuck is the green?
Ski-mask off, so you know it was me
Shopping at Ross, that shit rock, it not clean
I cannot cough, it's the Promethazine
Knockin' at yo door, bet a 4' for me
Man hold up
Pour some Aunt Jemima in my soda
Block getting hot, need two Motorolas
Young bitch on Snap, she's a bitch like I told ya
Bricks stay yellow, lil' nigga like Yoda
All these acts trashy, got a forum kinda color

[Chorus: Young Dick Mobbin]
My whip got the tints, so they can't see me when I sip (I sip)
You be talking shit, while yo' bitch is at my crib
Do not associate with me (nah)
Thots wanna procreate with me (nah)
I avoid 'em evasively
Outshine any fool who facin' me

[Break]

[Verse 2: Young Dick Mobbin]
Creepin' round the cut, never creepin' round the clip
All my goons grimy, all my goons be off them shits
If you lookin' for me, bitch, I'm probably trappin' out the crib
Try to set me up, but you know I came equipped
With that burner, with that laser, tell them opps, "See you later"
I got Tay-K with me, talkin' shit, you catch that Fader
I ain't talkin' magazines, I got a hundred round drum
We be chasin' paper, hittin' capers just for fun

[Chorus: Young Dick Mobbin]
My whip got the tints, so they can't see me when I sip (I sip)
You be talking shit, while yo' bitch is at my crib
Do not associate with me (nah)
Thots wanna procreate with me (nah)
I avoid 'em evasively
Outshine any fool who facin' me
