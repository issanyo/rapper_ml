[Introduction: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Damn young nigga I made myself the plug

Gotta alotta' money, gotta alotta' hoes
Gotta alotta' drugs, nigga what you want

I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Young nigga I made myself the plug

[Verse 1: Blvck London]
You a bitch, I'm the plug
Yo ho, she a dub
Pussy money weed that's all I need
Blue huneds' in my face that's all I see

Shawty' said she want to fuck, I tell her take a knee
You can give me face, but I can't fuck for free
And when I'm smokin' dubs, you can't hit my weed
Gold diggin' bitch don't get no love from me

Don't get no love from me
You ain't want the kid until I was countin' cheese
Gotta chirp on my celly, what dis' nigga need?
Meet me at the trap, you can shop with me

[Hook: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Damn young nigga I made myself the plug

I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Damn young nigga I made myself the plug

Gotta alotta' money, gotta alotta' hoes
Gotta alotta' drugs, nigga what you want

I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Young nigga I made myself the plug

[Verse 2: Tay-K]
I'm the plug, I make sales
If a nigga want some work, he can hit me on my cell
Bitch I'm fifteen, and I don't fuck with twelves
You niggas Microsoft, so tell me what's the Dell

Nigga you a goof, I'll call you Chapelle
I'm a young boss man, young Marcell
Niggas want to start shit, won't end well
Meet me at the 'partments, by the hotel

At 'partments gotta buy the whole bail
Throw me all the guap, I'll put it on a scale
Bitch I need my cheese, I ain't talkin' Rotel
Poured a whole 4, now I'm moving like a snail

[Hook: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Damn young nigga I made myself the plug

I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Damn young nigga I made myself the plug

Gotta alotta' money, gotta alotta' hoes
Gotta alotta' drugs, nigga what you want

I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Young nigga I made myself the plug
