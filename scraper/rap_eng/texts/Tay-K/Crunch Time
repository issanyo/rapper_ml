[Intro]
Big-Big-Big Los on track, boy

[Verse 1]
I be smokin' kush with my motherfuckin' folk (my folks)
If a nigga want some work, he could hit me on my phone (just hit my phone)
Give a fuck about a opp, 'cause I do this shit alone (I do it alone)
Give a fuck about a clock, 'cause I do things how I want (do what I want)
On my time, on my grind
And no bitches on my mind (not on my mind)
I will watch yo' ass get whacked
Just to see your bitch ass whine (to see you whine)
If you lookin' for me, nigga
I'm really not hard to find (not hard to find)
If you lookin' for me, nigga
You really could hit my line (just hit my line)

[Interlude]
Xanax, which is a brand name for Alprazolam, is a benzodiazepine. It is used as a sleep aid, and can also be used for anxiety. The recreational uses for the drug are similar to the prescribed uses. People rely on Alprazolam to help with their sleep or anxiety, and it can also be used to produce a euphoric-like feeling

[Verse 2]
Niggas run one drill and start to low-key, high-key feel theyself
Made her set her nigga up, I'm beginning to fear myself
Smoke a blunt, pop a Xan, take a tab, that's here and there
These niggas talkin' Backwoods, don't tell me y'all not hearin' it
Actin like a hood rat, like my t-shirt is not Japanese
She said "Put me on Tay-K," and I said put you on yo' knees (get on yo' knees)
Hood lil' bitch, love that, man, I really can't believe
I'm like maybe it's the Xanax, but maybe it's Maybelline
I remember all the connects I had on my HTC (my HTC)
All them fuck ass niggas hatin' me
While I'm thinkin' 'bout making it (I'm tryna make it)
