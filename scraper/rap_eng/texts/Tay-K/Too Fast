[Chorus: Tay-K]
Ri-Ri-Ridin' in the car, too fast
In the backseat, blowing gas
When I smoke, I need that Thraxx
Tell that bitch, I need my cash
Ri-Ri-Ridin' in the car, too fast
In the backseat, blowing gas
When I smoke, I need that Thraxx
Tell that bitch, I need my cash

[Verse: Bandz]
Tell that bitch I need my cash
Pop up and pull up in that Jag
In the strip club I throw that bag
In that backseat I blow that gas, oh yeah
Oh no, I need like all of that dope
Bitches, they come by the boat
Look at my wrist, man it's froze
Run out that backdoor right now
I got my cash on right now
Run up that payday, okay
Free my lil bro, Tay-K, okay

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Ri-Ri-Ridin' in the car, too fast
In the backseat, blowing gas
When I smoke, I need that Thraxx
Tell that bitch, I need my cash
Ri-Ri-Ridin' in the car, too fast
In the backseat, blowing gas
When I smoke, I need that Thraxx
Tell that bitch, I need my cash
