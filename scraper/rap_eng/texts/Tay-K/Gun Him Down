[Verse]
Pull up on his block, we gon' gun him down (down)
Posted up with the chopper, like "Who want it now?" (gang gang)
Run it up, run it up, I need a hundred thou'
Catch him lacking, walking home, we gon' jump out (rrah)
All these niggas, they play pussy, this a run down (run-down)
And my niggas, we gon' rock 'til the sun down (sun-down)
It was 12 o'clock at night, we brought the guns out (guns out)
Why these niggas wanna front now? (front-now, gang)
We was three deep, we had four poles (four)
One of these niggas gon' get Lil Jojo'd
Pull up on 'em with the sticks (gang)
Got three white bitches, they all want my dick
Leave that nigga R.I.P. off the rip
Now we gang deep, we posted up in VIP (gang, gang, gang!)
Codeine, promethazine, what I sip
And if she let me fuck the first night, she's a flip (flipper!)
Pull up on a nigga with the chopper, let it rip (rrah, rrah, rrah!)
Got a clip taped to a clip, run out and I'm gon' flip it
Leave a nigga dead in the street, a Ricky
That's what these niggas get, for fucking with me (gang, gang)
Youngest, hottest nigga in the fuckin' city
You still with your mama, suckin' on a titty (gang)
You showed me your bitch, now she fuckin' with me
You was in your feelings, I was in her kitty (pussy!)
I just bought a .30, shot a Glock, a glizzy (grrah)
Nigga try to kill me, then he coming with me
