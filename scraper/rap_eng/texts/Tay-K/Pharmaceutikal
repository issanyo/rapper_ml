[Intro: Tay-K]
Flood
Tay-K
Yung Kodz
Welcome to my pharmacy

[Verse 1: Tay-K]
Gucci on my Glock grip, nasty ass hoe
You know she gothic, gone off project
Smokin' on some Tropic, life is a mosh-pit
Take a nigga hostage, Tay-K with the opp shit
Bitch, I'm super toxic, beating off the bosses
I don't get exhausted
Kush got me feeling like a spaceman
Spark a nigga up, call me Raiden
Glitches, bitch, 'cause I'm faded
Feeling kinda rich, call me Daydate
Got your sister in the back, masturbating and stuff
She a freak, she like to play with herself (splash)
Trap full of bricks and broken boards
And a couple of Asian bitches tryna sharpen my sword
Boss man say, "Watch your arms and feet
And I can take ya head for some double XP" (splash, splash)
Got a ghetto bitch in the back watching Bleach

[Chorus: PiMPYZ]
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine

[Verse 2: Yung Kodz & Tay-K]
Bop, bop
I'm a lost menace in the system
Living like a bat, boy, call me a Detroit Piston
Rap is a disease, and this flow is a symptom (Flood, yuh)
I hand out lyrical murders, don't be my next victim (BRRT!)
Nice Slash style with a dirty attitude (Flood!)
Life is a song, and this rapping is just an attribute
Always keeping gratitude
Grounds with the earth, and you can feel the magnitude
Style we have is something, that's swag (Gang)
Catch the competition, man, I feel like Jerry Rice
(bap, bap, bap, bap!)
On the mic, there's no way to stop me
Cut the haters off like my name was Mr. Miyagi
(ba, ba-ba-ba-ba!)
Love success, cooking up the floss like bacon
We always up, never taking shit from someone hatin'
Me and Daytona like to take a .38
If she talking, hit her with a pedigree like Triple H

[Chorus: PiMPYZ]
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine

[Verse 3: PiMPYZ]
Hot-box, smoking wit' yo' bitch in the tent
Daytona Chargers, windows with the tint
Voss water by the glass, straight drinking with your bitch
Not Dwayne wade, but I came with the heat
Nigga, don't play, break hearts, call me H-B-K
Nigga all day
Nigga come through and your boyfriend gay
But a nigga like me tryna fuck all day
Back on the verse, put you in a hearse
Keep talking shit, little nigga, get murked
Lay him in the dirt, pussy wear a skirt

[Outro: PiMPYZ]
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Pharmacy boys, yeah, we blowing on green
Daytona 500, we come on the scene
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
Boss everywhere, I'm a aquamarine
