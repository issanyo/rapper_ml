[Intro: Tay-K & 21 Savage]
I-I-I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action (21, 21)
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well, let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my .9 with sub-compaction

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat her face (21)
Put it in your mouth, ahh, how it taste? (lil' bitch)
Backend nigga, that's a 100k (on God)
Four shows, nigga I can buy a Wraith (skrrt skrrt)
My street cred platinum, ain't nothin' fake (21)
Pulled up to the Slut Walk with a K (bitch)
You a internet gangster, I'm a ape (21)
Young Savage, Zone 6, EA (on God)
Hundred round drum hangin' off the drake (pew pew pew)
Instagram Live got him killed broad day (on God)
You can have the pussy, I want the face (21)
I ain't tryna cuff you, I don't want no case

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

[Verse 2: Tay-K]
Pimp gon' be eatin' good noodles every day
Bitch I'm drawin' doodles, Tay-K paint the way
Choppa tear your dudies into fish fillet
I woke up too moody, who gon' die today?
Shoot a fuckboy in his motherfuckin' face
We cookin' up, boy, you don't wanna go dat way
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades
Gotta go dat way, boy you not gon' be happy
I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase

[Verse 3: Young Nudy]
You want the drama? We got the drama
For you and your folks, them (folks)
Whole lotta guns, whole lotta chopper
Whole lotta smoke for them (whole lotta smoke for them)
Whole lotta mothafuckin' yellow tape
You don't wanna smoke with them (you don't wanna smoke)
That's about me, young nigga from the streets
Straight up PDE (straight up)
Shoot a mothafucka straight up in the face, closed case
Nigga, ask bout me
Nigga, I'm so gutta with it, I'm slimin'
Young nigga, I get with it (I get with it)
I'm with the shits, is you with the shits?
Nigga I don't think you with the shits (I don't think you with the shits)
Do you got that stick? 'Cause I tote that stick
Nigga, that's some daily shit, yeah (daily shit)
I'll pitaroll a nigga if I got to (pitaroll a nigga)
Nigga don't make me pull this stick out, I might chop you (I might chop you)
Nigga poppin' like some bitches
Go across your head and nigga you ain't gon' need no stitches (you ain't gon' need stitches)

[Chorus: Tay-K]
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race (skrt, skrt)
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast crackin' 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way (skrrrt)
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
