[Verse 1: Wa$tee]
Everyday it's four doors, everyday it's four whores
Everyday it's more and more stress
I'm feeling-feeling-feeling-feeling-feeling oh so blessed
I slit this shit and I aim for ya chest
I'm faded, I'm wasted, I'm polished, they mad
These niggas, they hating, don't want it, they mad
They trippin', they trippin', I want it, the head
They trippin' they trippin', I'm countin' that bread
All of my niggas we duckin' with feds
Fuck with my niggas ya know you is dead
All that I want is a house and some head
All that I want is some house and some head, uh

Had to get this shit all by my mothafuckin' me lonely

[Verse 2: Tay-K]
Once I, once I, once I get it
Gun time, gun time, now I gotta kill him
I ain't wanna do it, but Wa$tee said get him
I don't wanna jugg, but I am addicted

Saggy ass, saggy ass, stackin', yeah I'm stackin' on these hoes
