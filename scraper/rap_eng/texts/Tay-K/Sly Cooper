[Intro]
This is a certified hood classic

[Verse]
Creepin' round his block like I am Sly Cooper
Bitch I am no hooper, but you know that I'm a shooter
Muddy booster booster in the convertible cougar
Pour it up, pour it up, pour it up
The folks at my computer think that I pour way too much
The folks at my computer think that I don't care enough
And the folks on my computer don't think that I got it rough
But the folks in my computer fuck around and not wake up
'Cause I don't give a fuck, 'cause I can't give a fuck
Let my bitch hold the tool she look like Carmelita
You a chicken in the wrong coop and I can hear you cluck
I'm a dog, you could call me Snoop and I can smell yo' bucks
