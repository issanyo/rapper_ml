We live from the pits, ya' dig?
It's Jovanchy in this bitch with Tay-K from the mothafuckin' Boof kids
AKA Daytona Boyz Fast Life
Nyewm, nyewm, nyewm
Pew, pew, pew
Pffft, eeeeee!

[Hook: Tay-K]
I get the cash, I get the cash, yuh
I get the cash, cash, I get the cash, yuh
I do the dash, ice on my splash, I find ya' stash, yuh
Ballin' like Nash, I get the cash, I get the cash, yuh
I get the cash, I get the ca-ca-cash
I get the cash, I get the ca-ca-cash
Ballin' like Nash, I found ya' stash, I get the cash, yuh
I do the dash, I do the dash, I get the cash, yuh

[Verse 1: Tay-k]
Go get the bag, in here the strap, don't get attacked (yuh)
I know that he scared, I look at his eyes, I looked at his lash (I look at his lash)
I might just shoot, I might just hit, and never look back (yuh)
I just might buy, I just might jug, or I just might jack (yuh)
I'm at the trap, I'm in the back and I'm wearing them sacks, yuh
She's calling my trap phone, she's calling my iPhone, she want to have sex (yuh)
I can't even flex, yuh, ballin' like Nash (yuh)
I need the racks, I need the racks, I need the cash (yuh)
(I get the what?)

[Hook: Tay-K]
I get the cash, I get the cash, yuh
I get the cash, cash, I get the cash, yuh
I do the dash, ice on my splash, I find ya' stash, yuh
Ballin' like Nash, I get the cash, I get the cash, yuh
I get the cash, I get the ca-ca-cash
I get the cash, I get the ca-ca-cash
Ballin' like Nash, I found ya' cash, I get the cash, yuh
I do the dash, I do the dash, I get the cash, yuh

[Verse 2: Jaymoney]
Countin' the weight, ya' niggas ain't safe, I'm hittin' the safe (who hittin' the safe?)
You niggas ain't strap, stay in your place, don't come out the gate (don't come out the gate)
No face, no case, you made a mistake, call and I wait (hahaha)
It ain't no debate, we need pay, today ain't your day (nah)
Racks in my pocket, just blew 20K
Been flashing all day, what you trying to say?
Know we did it the hard way, know we did it our way
Ballin' like Penny Hardaway, Bruce Wayne shit the hard way
Play your part today, his cash card is ayy
Passing the gas, I'm spazzing yo' ass
Hop out the coupe, get dead on his ass
Pass me the bag, or pass me the mag
You know where he at, you know all he had
Where was the cash? That paparazzi was dead on yo ass
See cameras flash, just for a band
That was the end, and that's all I'm sayin'
Bands, bands bitch, bands
Bands, bitch, bands, bands, bands
