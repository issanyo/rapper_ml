[Intro]
Hella Sketchy
Free Santana, bitch!

[Verse]
Mama told me, "Never lose 'cause, baby, you're winner" (skrrt)
I was lurkin' 'round his block, he was lurkin' on my Twitter
At the trap with the Glocks, nigga, Tay-K babysitter
I was just tryna shine like some mothafuckin' glitter (shine, shine)
I was under rugs with my Cuz, tryna rob a plug
Lil' bitch hit me up, she want love, I ain't show her none
I said "Bitch, I'm a rugrat, I don't know how to love back" (rugrat, rugrat)
Them QP's and them dub sacks, girl, that's where my love at

[Chorus]
Choppa in the trunk, Glock in my hand
If a nigga run up on me, it's a wrap like Saran (gang, it's a wrap)
Choppa in the trunk (gang), Glock in my hand (gang)
If a nigga run up on me, it's a wrap like Saran
