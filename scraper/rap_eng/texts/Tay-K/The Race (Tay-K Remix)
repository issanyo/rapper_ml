Intro
Talk my shit nigga
Ayy,ayy,ayy,ayy

Verse 1
We talkin blues, baby look at the face
I risk my life for this shit everyday(ayy)
The opps broke,they ain't in this money race
I woke pissed, like "where the gas?", im taking [?] to the face (ayy)
Ay dont move cuz I will up it to yo face (face,ayy)
Gold teeth, cuz im knowin he DOA(ayy)
Dub back cuz they sayin it ain’t no face, plus I just went OT to fucc wit my lil' bae(ayy)
Chapter 1 dropped, the whole city went crazy
They sayin' its a classic, I say its my first tape
Fuck the other side wit .40s and yellow tape, my name ringin in the verse, so im knowin im on my way
Im tryna make 10 bands off one play
If everything right, I’ll be back the next day
Fuccin wit the mail, I lost a pack and lost faith
But im still eatin good bitch, this steak here filet
Glocc dirty, I just bought a clean K
Shoot a check in his muthafuccin face
And them splash bros still here,who wanna play
I ain't never been no pussy, you can see it in my face
Fucc the beat, I was tryna break the safe
Cuz where im from to be the man, you need that weight
So much weight around this bitch, I broke the scale
Caught yo mans down bad and he ain't have it on his waist ay ay
(fucc a beat i was tryna break the safe, cuz where  im from to be the man, you need that weight So much weight around this bitch, I broke the scale,Caught yo mans down bad and he ain't have it on his waist)
