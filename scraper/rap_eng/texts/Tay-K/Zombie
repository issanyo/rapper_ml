[Intro: PiMPYZ]
Trappin'
Yo, yo, yo
Big Los on the track, boy

[Chorus: HotBoy 414]
Back from the dead like a mothafuckin' zombie (Zombie)
Pull up on the squad if you really wanna try me (Try me)
Back from the dead like a mothafuckin' zombie (Zombie)
Pull up on the squad if you really wanna try me (Try me)
Back from the dead like a mothafuckin' zombie (Zombie)
Pull up on the squad if you really wanna try me (Try me)
Back from the dead like a mothafuckin' zombie (Zombie)
Pull up on the squad if you really wanna try me (Try me)

[Verse 1: PiMPYZ]
Huh, huh, uh
HotBoy, servin' in the parking lot, of the wholefoods
2028, still in an old-school (Vroom, vroom!)
Big pot, lil' drop, nigga that's a mudafu
Big couple wop, I'ma mix it with that TUS2
100 round drum, come and see what these nuts do (Big nuts)
Bitch, I'm on the block, yeah, a nigga used to cut school
Cut around my pipes, so you know them gettin' cut too
Gun a nigga down, when they find out, it's old news (Fa, fa, fa)

[Verse 2: Tay-K]
It's Tay-K and I'm back, yeah, I'm back (I'm back)
Niggas talkin' smack, they might have to get clapped (Pow-pow)
Nigga you a goof 'cause I maneuver wit' ya pack (Maneuver)
He sent us the money, we ain't send him nothin' back (Bah)
Niggas actin' spooked but they just need to relax (Just chill)
Pull up with the tool, he told boys he was a tac
Daytona in stoops, leave a niggas scalp back
All I speak is truth and you niggas don't know facts (Nah)
