[Intro]
Aye Dilip, fuck 'em up man
Danny Wolf

[Verse]
Bitch, I get the work and I make it do a backflip
Fuckin' with lil' Tay-K, nigga, do you want a casket?
Tay-K ate the beat, now the DJ wanna backspin
Nigga pull up on me, make him bounce like a mattress (skrrt, skrrt!)
Fucker pull up on me, it's gon' get real tragic (lil' bitch)
We can get up, like the fuckin' Y-Axis
File a nigga down, like a nail or some taxes
Sippin' on drop, I cannot sip molasses
Punch a nigga, now he Velma, "where my glasses?" (where yo' fucking glasses?)
Used to hate school, I was late to the classes (gang, gang, lil' bitch)
Hit from the blunt, she say Tay-K can you pass it (Tay-K, can you pass that shit?)
Make a nigga have a meltdown, if he plastic (hell nah, lil' bitch!)

[Hook]
Nigga, you on some stupid shit (gang!)
Pull up on yo' block with Ruger and Clips (we gon' pull up on your block!)
Don't make me have to do this shit (nigga!)
That life of yours, you will lose that shit (bitch nigga!)
She says I'm a lunatic (gang!)
Chopper with the cooling kit (cooling kit)
Pass the chopper, I'ma fool with it (I'm a fucking fool with it)
Have to Glock a nigga,, and you get hit
