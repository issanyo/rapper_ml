[Intro: Tay-K]
Gang, gang
Gang, free pimp, man, you know how we fuckin' rockin', nigga
Free J-Roc, free Sticky nigga, free Santana, nigga
And free Pimp again, bitch!
Gang, gang, Rug-Rat! Beep! Rrah, gang
500 degrees

[Chorus: Tay-K]
You a house nigga, you need to go inside (gang)
Go inside, bitch, they got that dope inside (lil' bitch)
Don't go inside there, you gon' see your hoe inside
No face, no case, bitch, I won’t get described
You a house nigga, you need to go inside (gang)
Go inside, bitch, they got that dope inside (lil' bitch)
Don't go inside there, you gon' see your hoe inside
No face, no case, bitch, I won’t get described

[Verse: Duwap Kaine]
Ayy, yuh, no case, bitch, no face, no holster on my waist, bitch
For any situation, got the toaster for some opp shit
Used to do that hot shit, used to be on the block, shit
Free Tay-K, that's a hot kid, whipping bricks, look like cotton
Stay with the stick, no option (pew, pew, pew)
I-I ain't running from no opp, whip my wrist until it lock
And that's not what I was taught, got a Glock, it got a mop
Nigga, if you want a plug, pull up on me, come and shop

[Chorus: Tay-K]
You a house nigga, you need to go inside (gang)
Go inside, bitch, they got that dope inside (lil' bitch)
Don't go inside there, you gon' see your hoe inside
No face, no case, bitch, I won’t get described
You a house nigga, you need to go inside (gang)
Go inside, bitch, they got that dope inside (lil' bitch)
Don't go inside there, you gon' see your hoe inside
No face, no case, bitch, I won’t get described
