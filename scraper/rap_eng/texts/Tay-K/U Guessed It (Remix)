Work in progress

[Introduction]
Chilling, in the studio
[?]
Yeah, [?] stay on the beat, about to kill it
This is all off the dome

[Verse: Tay-K]
Bitch you guessed
Walkin around with extras in my pocket
And you find rockets, shot you in your sockets
Young nigga blastin', I'm from California
Fresh out of long beach, baby gang, insane
You know we poppin like we crazy, insane
Make your ears rang (grah grah grah)
