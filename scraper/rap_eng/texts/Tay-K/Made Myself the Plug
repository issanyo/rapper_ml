[Intro: Blvck London]
Trap-a-Holics mixtapes
You rockin' wit' Dj YoungKash
Ya'll know what the fuck goin' on, man
Blvck London & Lil Tay-K 47, yeah

[Chorus: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga, made myself the plug
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga, made myself the plug, yeah
Got a lot of money, got a lot of hoes
Got a lot of drugs, nigga, what you want?
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga, made myself the plug

[Verse 1: Blvck London]
You a bitch, I'm the plug
Yo' hoe (yo' hoe), she a thug
Pussy, money, weed, that's all I need
Blue hunnids in my face, that's all I see
Shawty said she wanna fuck, I told her: "Take a knee"
You can give me face, but I don't fuck for free
And when I'm smokin' dope, you can't hit my weed
Gold diggin' bitch don't get love from me
Don't get no love from me
You ain't want the Kentel, I was countin' cheese
Got a chirp on my celli, what this nigga need?
Meet at the trap, you can shop with me

[Chorus: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug, yeah
Got a lot of money, got a lot of hoes
Got a lot of drugs, nigga, what you want?
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug

[Verse 2: Tay-K]
I'm the plug, I make sells
If a nigga want some work
He can hit me on my cell
Bitch, I'm 15, and I don't fuck with 12's
You niggas Microsoft, so tell me whats the Dell?
Nigga, you a goof, I'll call you Chapelle
I'm a young boss, man, young Marcell
Niggas wanna start shit, won't end well
Meet me at the 'partments by the hotel
At the 'partments, gotta buy the whole bell
Show me all the guap, I'll put it on a scale
Bitch, I need my cheese, I ain't talking rotell
Poured the whole fo', now I'm movin' like a snail

[Chorus: Blvck London]
I'm the plug, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug, yeah
Got a lot of money, got a lot of hoes
Got a lot of drugs, nigga, what you want?
I'm the plug, yeah, I'm the plug
Die young, nigga made myself the plug
