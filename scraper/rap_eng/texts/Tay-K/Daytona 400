[Intro]
Daytona Boyz

[Verse 1: Tay-K]
What ya gonna do when you see us outside?
.45 on the side, 'cause you know my niggas ride
Catch a case, but I'm like "Why?" 'Cause I stay in disguise
Robbed a full car, niggas won't say you want money, right?
Tryna' get my money tight, that's why we lurkin' at night
Grab yo' shit and take it straight to the bucket like I'm the wise tale
Pill on me like a knife, poured a four up in my Sprite
Got me slow like yellow light, took a hoe and bust it tight
Now she only text at night

[Verse 2: Quee 2 Times]
We got molly, we got white
I can't fuck with yo ass, cause you fuckin' wit' some dykes
I know niggas in the cut, and them niggas take your life
I can tell that you ain't shit when I look up in yo' eyes
I'm just out here with that garment, you ain't lookin' wise
They be talkin' all that shit, then my niggas hit yo' guys
I'm coolin' with them niggas that be really totin' nines
Always smokin' hella dope, my niggas really gettin' high
Fuck yo' big homie, we ain't seein' eye to eye
All my guys ride or die, pussy niggas gonna cry
I was out here with these niggas and you fuckin' cry
I don't even give a fuck, my niggas really gon' ride
