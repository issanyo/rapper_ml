[Hook]
Like a 40 pound weight, I stay lifted
Your bitch had me bored, so I kick-flip
Then I sneak her in your whip like Biff did
Then I sneak her in your whip like Biff did
Like a 40 pound weight, I stay lifted
Your bitch had me bored, so I kick-flip
Then I sneak her in your whip like Biff did
Then I sneak her in your whip like Biff did

[Verse]
Need the pack delivered, no ride, call an Uber, man
Pull a strap on my plug, he like "What you doin', man?"
Yes, I'm a loser man, yes, I'm a loser man
Shorty wanna be with me forever so I boot her, man
Bitch on my team, but she not in my gang
Clouds full of Codeine, I think it's gonna rain
She stayin' on the K saying, "Tay-K, you're fucked"
But he talking to the beat, so I'll test my luck
Pull up on a nigga with the dick, like, "what's up?"
He say he want some boof, and I said "I'll hook you up"
But I'm young Marc Lasry 'cause I'll take the Bucks
Opp drove past, so you know I had to duck
Daytona rear-dealing, you a Chuck the luck
Keep the toolie on me and that is a must
Flip the pack among week and they thought it turned to dust

[Outro]
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn. This the only young nigga I know selling drugs without a car. This nigga pulling up on y'all niggas in the motherfucking Uber, man. Skinny ass jeans with the rips in 'em, that's my nigga, my young nigga off up in this bitch. Your bitch bored, so he kick-flipped her ass like Lupe. Hoe ass nigga, get your motherfucking money right. I got young niggas stunting on y'all bitch-ass niggas, hoe-ass niggas. Clouds full of codeine around this bitch. Get some double-cups, hoe-ass nigga. Young Cam Provider off in this bitch, nigga
