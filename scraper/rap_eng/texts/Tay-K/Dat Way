[Intro]
Y'know how we rock, man (get it, let's get it, never leave motherfuckers)

[Verse]
I be totin' yoppas, bitch, that's everyday (everyday)
Let my white bitch hold the yoppa, call her Mary K. (Mary K.)
When my spot get hot like lava, gotta stay away (stay away)
Sometimes I be so damn high I don't know what to say (what to say)
That's why I can't fuck with ganja, marijuana stank
But I'm still on Fabiana, can't make up my brain (my fuckin' brain)
Let me know if you want it, jump out, get it, gang (gang!)
Two pistols, one Tay-K, call me "Tay-K Max Payne" (Payne)
Nigga try Lil' Tay-K, it's gon' be his last day (last fucking day)
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way (dat fucking way)
He think he hot, we put him out, where is the ash tray? (ash fucking tray)
I fucked yo' bitch on the first and the last date (last fucking date)
And I'm smoking dead opps out the ashtray (gang)
And I also got some K.K. in my ashtray (gang)
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way (gang)
Big glizzy knock yo' toupee (dat way, dat way)

[Hook]
Big 30, not no .38 (dat way, dat way)
And I'm smokin' dead opps out the ashtray
And I also got some K.K. in my ashtray
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way (dat way)
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way (dat way)
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way (dat way)
Big 30, ain't no .38 (gang, gang, beep!)
Big glizzy knock yo' toupee (beep)
And I'm smokin' dead opps out the ashtray
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way
And I also got some K.K. in my ashtray
If you not talkin' 'bout smoke, you could go dat way

[Outro]
Go dat way
