[Verse 1: Lin Que]
Uhh, now we got nutcrackers, body snatchers, and heart attackers
Mine the three combined, plus other tactics
I kick more flips, than acrobatics
So your plastic, couldn't get one charge to my dramatics
Don't pack it, got friends that'll let you have it
Don't start it, or else I have to grab it
Insane killer, my pain is out my brain
A dried up skull remains, another MC slain
Who been in the ciphers, I'm the lighter with the fire
You're purple, goin in circles like those Goodyear tires
Liars and labels on the other side of tables
When I-yah rebels I be kickin more channels than the cables
I'm ready willing and able to end your lifeline
Your windpipe's mine cause I'm inclined to kick the right rhyme
So very hardcore that you hit the hard floor
I score, when I do jacks I'm like in car doors

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
I lets it all fall down just like the rain
I scream your name but you better maintain
They all want more, they all want it raw
Well then baby hit the floor, it's time for round four
Keepin it hot, givin you the best that I got
You got the navigational plans, to my G spot
I reckon we can take it just a little bit slower
Like this beat we can all fall down on these white sheets
Life is grand when there's money in your hand
And a man by your side that's down witcha plan
But I'm in-dependent, yes I am
I make my own money, I rock my own jam
I drive my own ride and I buy my own gear
So when I hit it then I quit then I beez up outta there
I tried to warn him that I, wouldn't call him
But I, I had to jet and let it all fall on him

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

[Verse 3: Lin Que]
Now we got clowns, then I throw em down in instant replay
When I'm heated up I speed it up like a freeway
Your D-Day, is coming, summon your creator
The life fader, complex to me like alpha beta
Collectin data, you're gonna need it to defeat me
Some tried to sweep me off my feet, they must be sleepy
You're gonna have to bring it stronger than that
I'm on to your rap, and damn not the point of your crap
So chill before blood spills under the victim
My verse'll pimp all, and it'll kill when I say sick em
See I can vic em bout a crowd of a million
The villain, illin, not only here to make a killin
You're under pressure off the hardcore texture
The wrecker, will hear my steps when I come to get ya
Stunts who talk that junk I never front
If you talk all that you hunt then I'ma give you what you want

I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
