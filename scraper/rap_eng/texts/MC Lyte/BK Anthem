[Intro]
B-I, what up?
Long as I got a voice, you got a voice my nigga
Yessir

[Hook]
BK stand up, Brooklyn throw your hands up
If you with me, lick a shot for Biggie

[Verse One]
Chillin' in the spot in my B-Boy stance
Don't make this four-fifth kick like Bruce Lee roy pants
You know I'm smarter than Spock, for Leonard Nimoy fans
So this aluminum will foil your plans, that's how I'm doin' em man
I keep two in hand, in case I've been drinkin'
Seeing double, I got one for you and your twin
I got a nickel for your thoughts, make your blood trickle
Leave your smarts on the sidewalk, 'til the cops come and get you
I'm done playin' with you
The guns sprayin' with or without you
Make your body whistle without you, Young!
I'm still official without you
Still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh
He's so terrific, his lyrics like it's about you
You can't tell me that everything he spits that it's not true
I'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against wall
Took a lighter, left my name in the hall, Young!

[Hook x2]

[Verse Two]
Grew up on Lexington Ave, my socks real high
Moved to the Marcy Projects 'round the time I was five
Had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'Stuy
So on the Fourth of July, we would always stop by
Man, I ran through the bush, bought pounds from "the dreads"
They had the best beef patties and cocoa bread
Played the Albee Square Mall 'round the time I was gettin' tall
Where niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor
18 regime round then, Pink houses, Fort Greene niggas they ain't blend
Wasn't safe on the A train, D, G or the F
Decepticons, Lo-Life niggas snatch the Polo off your chest
East New York, Bushwick, fuck it, the whole BK
Brownsville, where the warriors come out to play
Nigga you better roll deep goin' through Coney Island
'cause it's one way out, nigga, one way in, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse Three]
Everywhere you go, Brooklyn's in the house, if you soft tuck your chain
The crooks is in the house, yes, the jooks is in route
The drama's on the way
Stare downs first, then the llamas gon' spray
Momma's gon' pray
But we respect real, you act like a sheep, you gon' be the next meal
The wolves is on the job
Gotta get in where we fit in
Not rid the show and the kids is growing
Baby need new shoes, and you sitting on 22's
And we got guns big as Samoans
And you in the spot showing off like Terrell Owens
Hell I'm on this nigga
You better hold your ground, if you a straw house
Then the fours will blow you down and its back to the home town, yes!

[Hook x2]
