[Lyte]	Ready?

[Lyte] *beatboxing like a pro*
[guy]	Okay, hello!
[Lyte]	Watch your drin.. WHAT?  Watch your drink!
	No no.. I think I'm too late, am I too late?

Hit it!
I'm coolin in the sun, on a beach in the cabana
Sippin on some vodka in a glass with Tropicana
I'm chillin and I'm chompin on a turkey shish-ka-bob
Too far from work to hear the phone ring at the job
Men in bikinis, G-strings should I say
Waitin for the daddy-LONG-one to come my way
Here he comes now, I feel I start to sweat
Blunder but I wonder just how wet will I get
He offers me his hand, of COURSE you know I take it
Until he tells me that he wants to swim a little naked
My eyes are bulgin, I black out, damn it's black as tar
Woke up I don't know when, sittin at the bar
I know it's hard to follow, the story's kinda tricky
What I didn't know was somebody slipped a Mickey
Into my drink, which caused a fantasy
And somehow slapped me back into reality!
Wish I had another Mickey I'd go back for a quickie
Find the daddy-long-one that was SURELY tryin to get me
This just goes to show, you must stop and think
When you're out partyin, never leave your drink..
WORD!
