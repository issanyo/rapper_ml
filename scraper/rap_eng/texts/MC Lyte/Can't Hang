[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Let's get down
Let's get down

[Verse 1: Kandi]
You claim, you've been waiting
With no game, just anticipating
How it would be if you and I were in the sack
But to me you look like you wouldn't know how to act

[Pre-Chorus: Latocha]
I need someone to hold me, all night long
It must be you my darlin', am I wrong
It ain't a damn thing baby, show me what you can bring
Cause some try to swang but they still can't hang

[Chorus]
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang

[Verse 2: Kandi]
You claim you can do this, this and that
Ain't no shame in my game
If it's wacky, I gotta tell you that
So you betta be up on your down stroke
You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat
Cause in my mind I think your gonna slip, baby

[Pre-Chorus: Latocha]
I need someone to hold me, all night long
It must be you my darlin', am I wrong
It ain't a damn thing baby, show me what you can bring
Cause some try to swang but they still can't hang

[Chorus]
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang

[Bridge: MC Lyte]
You talk a lot of this and you talk a lot of that
Is it all fact brotha man are you fat?
Cause if it's on the real I come with mad sex appeal
Flip light delicious, you know the deal
Hey that's me, I be the slick
The one with the physique
I freak you in the sheets
I take a nigga deep down under
I make him wonder
How to make the lighting come before the thunder
That's the pleasure I bring
I make a nigga get up and sing, tinga, linga, ling, ling
I got the pow, da boogie and the bang bang
You can't hang don't talk da game

[Chorus]
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang
You and me let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang, I betcha can't hang
You and me, you and me
