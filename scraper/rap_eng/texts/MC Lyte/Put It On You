[Verse 1:]
I got the nookie that's hooky like a chorus
You wanna winie my poo and get lost in my forest
Some wanna crawl up my sugar walls
Down my waterfall, what a candy call
I put it on you like an ass whipping, it's kinda sick
You wanna lick like Todd do his lips
Well, well, well what the shit
Gotta make it last if you wanna hit this
I'm into multiples, ones don't make it
Tried before but I just can't fake it
Hey it's a greedy world, I'm a greedy girl
Between the sheets it's my world
I gotcha what you like, believe it or not
Bottom of top I put you on the spot
It only takes a sec for me to get into it
Come on baby, let's do this

[Chorus:]
I wanna put it on you and make it hot
Can I put it on you and hit the spot
Can we get together and make it hot
Let's do this

[Verse 2:]
They ask how'd you get so freaky Lyte
How I keep it tight suction all night
Experience and imagination
Now kick your Timbs off get your buckle undone
That's sweet, now turn around baby let me see it
All that I want you can be it, sexual tension just free it
Have you done it on the moon yet, ahh shucks
Where we about to go will make your toes curl up
I'mma shake this money maker
Get your knot ready for the earthquaker
I'mma do you like they do in the Olympics
Flip after flip do you like your best trick
It only takes a sec for me to get into it
All it takes is you for me to wanna do it
Come on baby let's do this
Come on baby let's do it
