[Treach]
Waddup, this is Treach in the house
I like to comment, on my man Heavy D
As a person, he's one of the coolest..
People you'd even wanna get to know
Youknowmsayin, every time Heavy D comes out
It's a whole different level, he never stays on one side
He's one of the most unpredictable emcees, in hip-hop history
That has been, underrated in my opinion
But has more street respect than a lot of
The hardcore rappers that's out there right now
We love you from Naughty, Heavy, and we out

Uh, the reasons why I like Heavy D
Is he's like one of those types if rappers
