Uhmmm, Ooops! Hit me!
Oooooooooo, Hey! UhHuh!
Ohh, Uhhm! Uh! Oops, Hit Me!
Ooooooo! Hey, Uh Huh, Ohh, Uhhhmm, Come on

[Hook]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Salt & Pep]
[Salt]
Yo, let's talk about AIDS

[Pepa]
(go on)

[Salt]
To the unconcerned

[Pepa]
And uninformed

[Salt]
You think you can't get it?

[Pepa]
Well you're wrong

[Salt]
Don't dismiss

[Pepa]
Dis

[Salt]
Or blacklist the topic

[Pepa]
That ain't gonna stop it

[Salt]
Now if you go about it right you just might

[Pepa]
Save your life

[Salt]
Don't be uptight

[Pepa]
Come join the fight!

[Salt]
We're gonna tell you how you can get it

[Pepa]
And how you won't

[Salt]
All of the do's

[Pepa]
And all of the don't's

[Salt]
I got some news for you so listen, please
It's not a black, white, or gay disease
Are you ready, Pep?

[Pepa]
Yeah, I'm set

[Salt]
All right then, come on

[Salt & Pep]
Bet!

[Hook]

[Salt & Pepa]
[Salt] So if you do come up HIV positive
[Pepa](mmm-hmmm)
[Salt] Or have AIDS
[Pepa] Yeah
[Salt] We just want you to know
[Pepa] (what?)
[Salt] that there are treatments
[Pepa] That's right!
[Salt]And the earlier
[Pepa] The sooner
[Salt] Detected the better off you'll be
[Pepa]Tell 'em please
[Salt] Hey, yo, Pep, you get checked?
[Pepa] Yep, every year, G!

[Verse 2/ Pepa & Salt]
[Pepa]Now, you don't get AIDS from kisses, touches, mesquito bites
[Salt] Or huggin'
[Pepa]Toilet seats, telephones
[Salt] Stop buggin'
[Pepa] You get it for sex or a dirty drug needle
Anal or oral now, people!
[Salt] Women can give it to men and
[Pepa] Men mostly to women!
[Salt] The facts are simple, right and exact
[Pepa] And once you get it, there's no turnin' back for you
[Salt] There ain't a cure
[Pepa] So you gotta be sure
[Salt] Protect yourself
[Pepa] Or don't have sex anymore
[Salt] Mothers might give it to their babies through the womb
[Pepa] Or through birth, don't be an ass and assume
[Salt] AIDS ain't got no smell or taste
[Pepa] It don't care about your race
[Salt] You see a nice, kind face
[Pepa] You think you're safe?
[Salt] I'm sorry, that's just not the case
[Pepa] There's no debate
[Salt] Conversate
[Pepa] With your mate
[Salt] And don't wait
[Both Salt & Pepa]
Until it's too late!

[Hook]

Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies - let's practice safe sex, all right
(repeat)

[Pep & Salt]
[Yo, Salt...
What?
You know what else will stop the spread of AIDS?
Unh-huh
If everybody stop cheating and messing around and just stay with one person
...And wear condoms]
