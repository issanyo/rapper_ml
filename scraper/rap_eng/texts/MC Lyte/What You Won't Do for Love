[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, I'm ecstatic for love
Fanatic of love
And if I'm not around
It's you I'm thinkin' of
I gotta make it real for you
Whenever I deal wit you
I do do do do anything

[Verse 1]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find the love within
So I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well, I'm in a daze from your love, you see, yeah
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up

[Verse 2]
My friends wonder what is wrong with me, yeah
'Cause I'm in a daze from your love, you see
So I came back to let you know
Oh, I got a thing for you
And I can't let go

Although I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

[Chorus]
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything
But you don't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yeah, come on now, listen
Through the ghetto in the projects of Queens
I gotta get to you 'cause you do them things to me
My love shows
Nobody knows how my adrenaline flows and to the heights it goes
And ayo, see, 'cause when you're filling me up
You're enough, when you're ready for that nut
Babe, I'll be that buttercup
And I catch every drop
You got a chick on lock for you
I'll go through the storm and skip to the road blocks
We can rumble in cuss
We can fight and we can fuss
But know that I'm never giving up
It's nothing I won't do
Nothing I won't go through
You're worth the joy and the pain
I'ma keep it true

[Chorus]
What you won't do
Do for love
You tried everything
But you won't give up
In my world, only you
Make me do for love
What I would not do

Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
Do for love
You tried everything
Won't give up
