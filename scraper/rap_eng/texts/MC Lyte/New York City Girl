[Intro: MC Lyte]
New York City!
You are now rocking with the best
(Oh yeah. Uh huh)

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
Get out the way
I'm on the FDR, flying
GPS lying, headlights blinding
Comin' through your hood with a smack 'em up assignment
Cold brick rich, just fucking up your climate
Still lookin' for that star, nigga I'm it
Out of this universe, like a comet
So sick with the spit, call that shit vomit
Lost your love for Hip-Hop
Well, I'mma make you find it
It's the return, Of the BK bomber
I'mma burn, through your city like fire
But first Cozy Burger
I know you heard of the spot
That get you high, after the club is heard of
Brooklyn to Far Rock is screaming: "Murder murder!"
Get 'em so hot, now niggas rip your shirts up
I know you all saying: "Damn, what the nerve of Lyte."
Yeah that's me

[Hook]
I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (New York City girl)
(The sun is going down, one time!)
I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner (Woo!)
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (Follow me!) (New York City girl)
(Uh!)

[Verse 2: Charles Hamilton]
I gotta pretty, witty, city chicky, really getting busy
When she visit a party
She sipping Remy and Henny 'til she get dizzy
Work tomorrow is lookin' iffy
But tomorrow is Friday, so what a pity
Her jeans don't fit
But she don't throw a hissy
It's a formality of her anatomy of being thicky
She listen to everything from Biggie, to 50, to Tricky
And Was it me or she been kickin' it with niggas on 50
In the 8th Ave, that's Polo's old hood
She oh so good with her Manolo look
Look at the ground, she got Manolo feet
So fly, when she talk, she got Manolo teeth
I so wanna beat, but I got cold feet
She told me to go to Soho and get a pair of toesies

(Hello baby, New York City girl)

[Hook]
(One time for ya!)
I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (New York City girl)
I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (New York City girl)

I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (New York City girl)
I'm a Brooklyn girl, international swagger
Don't treat me like an out-of-towner
Just say... (Hello baby)
I'm a... (New York City girl)
