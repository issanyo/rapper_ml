[Intro] [MC Lyte]
This struggle continues (x2)

[Chorus]
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I want to jam it with you
We jamming (Bob Marley, Bob Marley)
I hope you like jamming too

[Bob Marley]
There is no rules, there is no vows we could do it anyhow
I and I will see you through
Because everyday we pay the price, with a living sacrifice
Jamming until the jam is through
We jamming, to think that jamming was a thing of the past
We jamming and I hope the jam is going to last

Nobody can stop us now, we need to [?]
We can't be bought nor sold
You can pay alright [?] your children every night
Life is much more than gold

[Chorus]
Holy Mount Zion
Holy Mount Zion
Jah sitteth in Mount Zion
And rules all creation

[Bob Marley]
The mighty will te try, the truth it cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
Love that does exist, is the one the Lord presist
So jam by my side

[MC Lyte]
We jamming on the one for the daughters and sons
No the struggle is not over til the battle is won
Hip-Hop is life but it isn't all to me now
Where will we be if they take our mic from we
Or better yet strip us from life itself
They done-done it before so I sit behind the door
Those that claim but don’t really know the game
Bob Marley, know the man behind the name (yeah!)

[Chorus]

[MC Lyte]
J-A double M-I-N
We be jammin from Brooklyn down to Kingston
We be jammin in the name of the lord, sweet Allah
Without the blessings from above I ‘naw be no rap star
Exodus when i bust
See the struggle i must
Realize it ain't just
But whats next
On the cusp all soldiers at war
Steadily ignored
Still we ain't sure
What the battle is for
Years ago when we toured
Ready to explore
Entered through back doors
Treated like stink-manure
Spoke up for rights, we were cracked in the jaw
Elvis made a bundle while we remained poor (yes)
We remained poor
But we be jammin (yes)

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
We be jammin
Come a long way, but we still not there yet

[Bob Marley]
I and I will see you through

[MC Lyte]
The struggle continues

[Bob Marley]
Jam’s about my pride and truth I cannot hide
To keep you satisfied
True love that now exist is the love I can’t resist
So jam by my side
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
And we’re jammin in the name of the lord (in the name of the lord)
We’re jammin (we’re jammin)
We’re jammin right straight god (from god)
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Holy mount zyon, we’re jammin right straight from god
Yes, (Iya)
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through
I and I will see you through

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We jamming (Know the man behind the name)
Hope you like jamming too
