[Verse 1]
My girls, goin 'round talking
They say that you've been watchin' me boy
I know by the way you're talking
That you're really tryin' to get to me boy
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes you think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more

[Verse 2]
I know your whole story
Because you're fine boy, and you know it
You think that you can have me
Just listen closely, no it ain't so easy
Every word you said I have heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told, nothing else compares
To this loving body

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my loving
I know you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it boy
No it won't come easy no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more

Do you want this? Don't ya?
Say it

[Rap Verse: MC Lyte]
Ay yo, Janet, now I'm about to kick this
You want this, but do ya really think you can get this?
At first you dissed this, now you wanna kiss this
Tell 'em girls! [Too late, ya missed this]
Cuz we need a man that's real quick and clever
Ready at the drop of a dime to whatever
Not tryin' to front or fake or save face
Cuz I'm with that there any time, any place

[Bridge: Janet]
You want this, don't you?
You want this, say it
You want this, you want this
Can you handle this, well, come here then

[Outro]
Early in the mornin', late in the evening
Just about around midnight
Cause you know i'll do you right, baby
What's my name baby, cause you gotta say my name baby
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit softer now, nice and easy
