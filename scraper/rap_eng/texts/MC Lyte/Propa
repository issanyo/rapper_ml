[Intro: MC Lyte]
We comin' down in '98
Set it straight
For all those that chose to contemplate
We gon' to it 'til the break

[Verse 1: MC Lyte]
Rap is hip hop over populated
I made it but I’m still underrated
I go beep beep like a Motorola beeper
Your lines are hard but mines are much deeper
Creeper on the midnight stroll
Never need parole
Totally in control of my destiny
Here’s the best of me
On vinyl finally for all to see
I’m the only one here at the showdown
That don’t need a piece for the shit to go down
"What up Lyte?" Nigga hell if I know
Trying to keep it real with all my little bros
Wanting to be a friend, some don’t believe
‘Cause in the past they been deceived
But I’m the motherfucker that breeds honesty
Tell you like it is and then leave you where you be

[Chorus: Beenie Man]
So from the east to the west the music is propa
So do it for me, mama
Original rapper
Other MCs slide down the gutter
Soft like butter
Name of the rapper
MC Lyte and Beenie Man deya
So do it to me, mama
Original rapper
Other MCs slide down the gutter
Soft like butter
So listen what my sister say

[Verse 2: MC Lyte]
Now you know I gotta keep 2 just like Noah
From Brooklyn to the corner of Balboa
Get a fresh stock keep ‘em on lock
They wanna act like they don’t know the resume
Knowing that I leave shit up in disarray
Never will I ever have to say “Mother may I”
Be this fly until the day I die
Now I realize I don’t need alibis cuz I don’t lie
I’m way too wise
My head he will anoint
I’m the focal point
Have them all screaming, “Yo, that’s the joint!”
As if I didn’t know just how to rock a show
I’m the last dragon to attain the glow
My plans to be to make history
Can’t none of y’all rid hip hop of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: MC Lyte]
I got game for days in this entertainment shit
I rap shit, act shit, never that wack shit
I'm busting numbers, fuck the crap shit
Coast to coast, niggas know I float
Red eye flights, hitting licks I wrote
‘Cause my dynasty is ordained, I planned it
My reign? Niggas can’t stand it!
They in denial while I’m on the prowl
More than six fouls blowing like Miles
I lay like tiles, crocodile smile
For the naysayers who wanna know how
My plans to be to make history
Can’t none of y’all rid hip hop of me
"Lyte who?" Lyte the MC, baby!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Beenie Man]
My life and your life is a familiar
Every day they wanna put me in the media
But I really got mi steel boat formula
And I want to set it off like [?]
[?] MC want to take my place
Want to [?], give me space
[?] don't control my first place
So I fighting for second and third place
But everybody in the place
Simma dem wind up
[?] the bass, yeah

[Chorus]
