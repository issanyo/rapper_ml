[Verse 1]
I want your hands on me
What I want, give me
You know I wanna please you
What I wanna do to you

You don't waste no time, do you?
You know I'm looking through you
Why you wanna tease me
I want you to come and please me

[Chorus]
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

[Verse 2]
You know that I can thrill you
I want you call me to you
I wanna move, will you?
I really wanna feel you

[Chorus]
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Say hello my name is
How my name is
Lyte, lyte, lyte, lyte, lyte
Look look look I'm in the mood for love
Look I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Simply because you're near me

I'm not the type of girl to put on a show
'Cause when I say no, yo, I mean no
But when it comes to you
I just can't refuse
I've been around the bush
Give you all types of blues

I love the way you make me feel
I never fight it
And when you are near I get so excited
I want you to love me
And just touch me
Put your hands, put your hands on me

[Bridge]
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me
Put your hands on me

[Chorus]
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

[Post-Chorus]
Hands, gimme love
Hands, gimme those

I want your
Gimme, yes
Gimme, yes
Aaahhhh

[Chorus]
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me
Put 'em on, put 'em on, put 'em on me

[Post-Chorus]
Hands, gimme love
Hands, gimme those
