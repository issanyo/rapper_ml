[Intro (Repeat 8X)]
You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better work it, boy

Work it, boy
Work it, boy
Work it, boy
Work it, boy

You want this, you know it's true
You want this (You better work it, boy)
You want this, you know it's true
You want this

You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better work it, boy
You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better, you better work it
You better work it, boy

[Verse 1]
My girls, goin’ 'round talking
They say that you've been watchin' me boy
I know by the way you're talking
That you're really tryin' to get to me boy
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes you think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my loving
I know you want this

[Post-Chorus]
You want this, you know it's true
You want this (I know, I know you want)
You want this, you know it's true
You want this (I know, I know you want)
(I know you want…)
(I know you want…)
(I know you want…)
(I know you want…)

[Verse 2]
I know your whole story
Because you're fine, boy, and you know it
You think that you can have me
Just listen closely, no, it ain't so easy
Every word you said I have heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told, nothing else compares
To this loving body

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my loving
I know you want this

[Pre-Chorus]
(You want this)
Early in the mornin' (You want this)
Late in the evening (You want this)
Just about around midnight (You want this)
‘Cause you know I'll do you right, baby (You want this)
Oh, what's my name, boy (You want this)
Just a little bit louder now (You want this)
Just a little bit softer now (You want this, you know it)
(You want this, you know it’s true)
(You want this)
(You want this, you know it’s true)
(You want this) (I know you, I know you want…)

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Ayo, Janet, now I'm about to kick this
You want this, but do ya really think you can get this?
At first you dissed this, now you wanna kiss this
Tell 'em, girls (Can you handle this?)
‘Cause we need a man that's swift, quick, and clever
Ready at the drop of a dime to whatever
Not tryin' to front or fake or save face
‘Cause I'm with that there any time, any place
Tell ‘em, J

[Bridge: Janet]
You want this? You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well come here then
You want this? You want this?
Can you handle this?
Can you handle this?
Well come here then
You want this (You want this, you know it’s true)
You want this? (You want this)
You want this? (You want this, you know it’s true)
(You want this) Can you handle this?
(You want this, you know it’s true)
(You want this) You want this?
(You want this, you know it’s true) Can you handle this?
(You want this)

You want this?
(I know you, I know you want…)
(You better work it, boy)
You want this? (I know you, I know you want…)
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this
You want this, you know it’s true
You want this, you know it
You want this, you know it’s true
You want this, you know it
(I know you want…)
