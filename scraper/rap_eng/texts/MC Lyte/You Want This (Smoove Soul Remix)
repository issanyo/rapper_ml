[Spoken Intro: Janet Jackson]
You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well come here then
Can you handle this?

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yo, J, now I'm about to kick this—you want this?
But do you really think that you could get this?
At first you dissed this, now you wanna kiss this
Tell 'em, girls (Can you handle this?)
'Cause we need a man that's swift, quick, and clever
Ready at the drop of a dime to do whatever
Not tryna front or fake or save face
'Cause I'm with that there any time, any place

(Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up)

[Verse 1]
My girls
Been goin 'round talkin'
They say that you been
Watchin' me, boy
I know
By the way you're talkin'
That you're really tryin'
To get to me, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you
I know how bad you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
So you want my lovin', no
I know you want this

(Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up)

[Verse 2]
I know
Your whole story
Because you're fine and
And you know it
You think
That you can have me
Just listen closely
No, it ain't so easy
Every word
You've said I have heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told
Nothin' else compares
To this lovin' body

[Chorus]
If you want my future then
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be beggin' me for more
So you want my lovin', no
I know you want this

(Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, come on
Yo, you know I want this, mmm, and you know I want that, word up)

[Bridge]
You want this
You know it's just true
You want this
You know it
You want this
You know it's just true
You want this
You know it

[Under bridge]
You want this?
You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well come here then

Early in the mornin'
(you want this)
Late in the evenin'
(you want this)
Just about around midnight
(you want this)
'Cause you know I'll do you right, baby
(you want this)
Ooh, what's my name boy?
(you want this)
'Cause you gotta say my name, boy
(you want this)
Just a little bit louder now
(you want this)
Just a little bit softer now
(you want this)
