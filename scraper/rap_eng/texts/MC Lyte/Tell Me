Get this party started

[Erick]
Def Squad, yeah, Flipmode
Raw Footage, uh, yeah
While I write y'all, jump in take a ride with me
New hummer, no Lisa's, a few dom pieces
The L-Y-T-E, I cram to understand and
The R-A-H D and me E-D, ah
Hey Mr. DJ, give a jigga-jigga back spin
If you do like this then bring it back in
I'll break ya neck like ya Bus-A-Bus
I'm on the floor with a chick that's voluptuous
Tell y'all keep the music pumpin'
We got the party jumpin'
Bartender bring me something
Water boy, keep it coming
Yeah, out the sprinkler like a Nelly video
All blaze one, this is rap phase one
I burn anybody, third degree
And ? cats like ? from A-M to P-M
I'm a M-C and producer
Seduced like the Kama Sutra
Beyond the stuff that ya used ta

[Female Voice] (Erick)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me (yeah)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me (gimme the light)

[MC Lyte]
The nerve of y'all
I spit shit so thick like a swerve on a curb all and murder y'all
Ain't shit to me (aha), rap stacked in plaques
I'm history, these wack chicks can't F with me
We get a rude awakening, B-K bomb, I got 'em shakin'
Def Squad, no fakin'
It's Erick Sermon and me
Niggas fix ya face fore I fucks it up permanently
Hit that, quit that, then burn it a B
You work hard for the cash, I make it work for me
On my worst day, see I hammer that ass
Line for line, let's see whose stamina lasts
I'm slammin' ya fast like Def Jam poetry
You know it's me, the most ?
Bitches grab your notes, send your checks to me
Best to be there cause I beat down my enemies, man

[Female Voice] (Erick)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me (yeah)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me (Rah Digga, Flipmode)

[Rah Digga]
Rah D-I, G-G-A y'all
I'm from the Bricks where we don't play y'all
I fly through ten people like I was skin measles
Triple X ready to wreck like Vin Diesel
Can't ? the battle, run around when we finished
Show the tapes to my dogs like we was all menace
Look how long I sit, still big as it get
People still runnin' up with that Digga-Digga shit
Look at these bitches, now they wanna flip it
Tryna rock hard but they better off strippin'
Who think they could rip any state group of chicks
I come creepin' with a mask like a St. Lunatic
I'm a diva by day but when the clock strike twelve
It's back to wife beaters, jeans and white shells
Pen and five L's, crowd waitin' for ya
Comin' out the room, champ like I'm De La Hauyer, dirty

[Female Voice] (Erick)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me (aha, yeah)
Tell me if you don't feel me (so what you sayin')
Tell me if you don't feel me, tell me if you don't feel me

[Erick]
Yeah, what
