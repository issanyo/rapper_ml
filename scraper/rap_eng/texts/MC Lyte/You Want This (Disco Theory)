Can you handle this?
You want this?
Well, come here then

You want this?
You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well, come here then

You want this?

You want this?

[Verse 1]
My girls, are going 'round talkin
They say that you been, watchin' me, boy
I know, by the way you're talkin
That you're really tryin', to get to me, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Not anyone I'll just let in my heart
You have to be hungry for me
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
What makes me think that I can say this to you?
I know how bad you want this

[Chorus]
If you want my future, baby
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my lovin'
I know you want this

[Post-Chorus]
You want this, you know it's true
You want this
You want this, you know it's true
You want this

[Verse 2]
I know, your whole story
Because you're fine and, and you know it
You think, boy, you can have me
Just listen closely
No, it ain't so easy
Every word you've said I have heard before

[Pre-Chorus]
Girls may have been easy
But you have to please me
One thing I've been told nothing else compares
To this lovin' body

[Chorus]
If you want my future, baby
You better work it, boy
No, it won't come easy, no
I know you want this
By the time I'm through with you
You'll be begging me for more
So you want my lovin'
I know you want this

[Post-Chorus]
(You want this)
Early in the morning (You want this)
Late in the evening (You want this)
Just about around midnight (You want this)
'Cause you know I'll do it right, baby (You want this)
Ooh, what's my name, boy? (You want this)
'Cause you gotta say my name, boy (You want this)
Just a little bit louder now (You want this)
Just a little bit softer now (You want this)
You know it...

[Rap: MC Lyte]
Yo, J, now I'm about to kick thisâ€”you want this?
Do you really think that you could get this?
At first you dissed this, now you wanna kiss this
Tell 'em, girls (Can you handle this?)
'Cause we need a man that's swift, quick, and clever
Ready at the drop of a dime to do whatever
Not tryna front or fake or save face
'Cause I'm with that there any time, any place
Tell 'em, J

[Outro: Janet Jackson]
You want this?
You want this?
Can you handle this?
Well, come here then
