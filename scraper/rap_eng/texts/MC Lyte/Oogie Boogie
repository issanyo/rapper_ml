If you're thinkin', you're too cool to boogie
Boy, oh boy, have I got news for you
Everybody here tonight must boogie, let me tell ya
You are no exception to the rule
So get on up on the floor
'Cuz we're gonna boogie, oogie, oogie
Till ya just can't boogie no more
(Boogie)
Boogie no more, you can't boogie no more
(Boogie)
Boogie no more, listen to the music
There's no time to waste, let's get this show on the road
Listen to the music and let your body flow
The sooner we begin, the longer we got to groove
Listen to the music and let your body move
So get on up on the floor
'Cuz we're gonna boogie, oogie, oogie
Till we just can't boogie no more
(Boogie)
Boogie no more, you can't boogie no more
(Boogie)
Boogie no more, listen to the bass play
Boogie, boogie
Get down, boogie, oogie, oogie
Get down, boogie, oogie, oogie
Get down, boogie, oogie, oogie
Get down
