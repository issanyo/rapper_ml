MC Lyte: Tell 'em what you see Miss High Riser

I see money come between my best friend and me (What else?)
I see old friends become new enemies (Tell 'em where you been)
I've been through a couple of litigations
I've been through character assassination

They try to put this stick in between my wheels
But they can't stop my motivation, nothing will
Well I walked through the valley where the shadow of death is
I feared no evil cuz I'm protected

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Cuz I'm walking with the heavenly father
And I do believe that I'm gonna prosper
Cuz I'm walking with the prayers of my mother

You won't get the best of me even though you broke my heart
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)
You won't get the best of me even though you broke my heart
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)

I was thinkin'... Maybe this isn't the live for me
I was thinkin'... Maybe I should leave the music industry
I've been... Betrayed by the people I trusted
I've been... Ohhh, seriously disgusted

They try to put this stick in between my wheels
But they can't stop my motivation, nothing will
Well I walked through the valley where the shadow of death is
I feared no evil cuz I'm protected

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Cuz I'm walking with the heavenly father
And I do believe that I'm gonna prosper
Cuz I'm walking with the prayers of my mother

You won't get the best of me even though you got my money
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)
You won't get the best of me even though you got my money
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)

MC Lyte:
You can't get the best of me cuz of my destiny
Not to be less than me, but to be more so don't question me
I came and I conquered, I soared to new heights and still I explore
In my fight to survive, Lyte still do right
Keep my eyes on new sights, I continue to plight
So when you try hurtin' me, even desertin' me
Know that I'm designed to overcome adversity
Wanna bring out the worst in me, it won't happen
Cuz I take responsibility for my action
My tenacity, well it has to be everlastin'
Cuz even when it comes to backstabbers I'm laughin' haha

You won't get the best of me even though you broke my heart
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)
You won't get the best of me even though you got my money
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)

You won't get the best of me even though you broke my heart
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)
You won't get the best of me even though you got my money
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Don't stop, reach up)

You won't get the best of me because by the grace of God
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)
You won't get the best of me because by the grace of God
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)

You won't get the best of me because by the grace of God
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)
You won't get the best of me because by the grace of God
I'm gon' pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)
