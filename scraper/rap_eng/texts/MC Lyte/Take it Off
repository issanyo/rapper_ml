Now you called my house and you said come over
Your mother and your father are gone, and you're alone
With Rover the dog, but now you're frontin
You said if I come you'd give me somethin
So don't start playin around cause I'm serious
What did you call me for cause I'm curious
Or did you call me just to look in my face
Now I know I didn't come just to take up space
The night is right, and the stars are bright
So c'mon now brother just treat me right
And just take it off, I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can SWING
I don't smoke and I don't get high
But if I say I don't love well that would be a lie
Because I do every chance I get
But if I don't I won't fall I won't fret
I'm no fool I got plenty of sense
So I just be cool, and have patience
Make up your mind, please let me know
And when you give me the green that's when I'll go
So please pretty boy don't hesitate
And entice me nice and cooperate
You tried the rest and I tried the best
And when the time comes boy no regrets
And just take it off

Now take off your hat, untie your shoelace
And after you finish, I want you to face me
Now baby, don't get scared
Cause I'm not like the other girls so don't compare me
Tender lovin care is all I give
And if possible boy, well I would like to live with you
And if I do it ain't everybody's business
It seems to me ya just how you got into this
Take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby, until the last drop
Cruisin down the street in my SL
When I seen this dude who was built very well
Face was handsome, body was fine
How did I know, I was cruisin behind him
Looked at the car, looked at me
Then he asked me my name, I told him Lyte the MC but
I didn't want to outplay my hand
So I talked so smooth he could understand me
He was definitely the move
I only said sweet things, that could soothe him
Opened up the door, and he got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told him take it off - I mean everything
Hurry up pretty boy so that we can swing
I mean take it off, cause I'm ready to rock
Like Maxwell baby until the last drop

Met this guy at an amusement park
He was good to go and it was after dark
You can guess girls what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time baby
Instead the boy asked me my sign
And I said, "Why?" and he said, "Never mind."
When the time come and it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign don't make a difference only how you make love to me
You make me feel so good you're a man
Oooh baby I melt like cotton candy
If I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and I'd also be your wife
So let's take a bout through the tunnel of life
Because you know what I'm thinkin of..
.. c'mon baby just take it off

Take it off
Take it off
That's right, now take it off
Take it off
Pal Joey, take it off
C'mon now, take it off
