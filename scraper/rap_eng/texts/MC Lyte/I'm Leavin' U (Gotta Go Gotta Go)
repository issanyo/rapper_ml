Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go
Bye Bye, bye bye, boy                                                                                   I'm thinkin' about leavin' U                                                            Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
Gotta get away, I gotta do it now
I gotta step into the sun, ha ha
You see I'm leavin' baby, on the midnight train to Georgia
Nobody to blame I feel the same
Too many days filled with rain, I can't take the pain
I must maintain
After all these years isn't it strange
That to remain sane I gotta make a change
I'm leavin my way
And you can't come out to play
Don't you know it's gonna hurt so much inside
And these are feelings you can't deny
And don't you know if you walk outside that door
Leavin' me for more, I guess I'll have to follow you
And I'll watch everything that you do baby
Gotta go, gotta go
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinkin' about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinkin' about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
You gotta take it all away regardless of what I say
Don't you know I can't hear none of that
Yeah maybe I'm a little cracked
Once you find love as real as the sky above
You know I'll want more
Cause I'm a part of everything you do
Baby I got to go
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinkin'about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinkin' about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
Hey girl I'm missin' you, yeah my heart broke right in two
The pain hurt slowly, you're my one and only
Baby I want to be kissing you, smacking those lips until they fall in two
I'm so lonely, girl I want to be kissin' you
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinkin' about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
Bye bye, bye bye, boy I'm thinking about leavin' U
Gotta go, gotta go, hey gotta go, gotta go
You're not an OP like Bootsy but I still believe
Showed you all the tricks up your sleeve indeed
I proceed with caution
Got you thinkin' about the love that you lost but damn, I got to leave
No you can't go, I need to time grow
I'm ready and I'm heading toward the next plateau
If you see me uptown, Riverside Drive to me this babydoll, just walk on by
Bye bye, but I love you
Bye bye, baby I love you
I gotta go, I gotta leave
I gotta go, I gotta leave
(Bootsy and Lyte)
Got to go, see ya
