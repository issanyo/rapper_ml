[ VERSE 1: MC Lyte ]
I'm a big shot, hot shot, gimme one shot, I wreck shop
In and out the boon docks I got the street smarts
I'm on the air like Jordan
You'll never die of boredom
You'll only hear my floor them
I'm on them, I'm in there, so prepare to live it up
I'm on the type of... that makes a... wanna give it up
So what's up with the logics?
It's the L to the E, and you hear me in the projects
And I didn't get hard yet, so dodge it
Watch me enlarge it, I'ma roadhog it
So you think you can get with me?
(It's the L to the E) Why don't you step to me?
(It's the L to the E) Why don't you step to me?
(It's the L to the E) Why don't you step to me?
(It's the L to the e) Why don't you step to me?

[ VERSE 2: Lin Que ]
I'm a big shot, hot shot, gimme one shot, I wreck shop
Pad locks, nine Glocks, still I got the street smarts
Yeah, I'm on the air like Jordan
You'll never die of boredom
You'll only hear my floor them
Cause I'm on them, I'm in there, so prepare to live it up
I'm on the type of shit that make a bitch wanna give it up
So what's up with the logics?
It's the L to the Q, yo, I think you better dog that
And I didn't get hard yet, so dodge it
Watch me enlarge it, I'ma roadhog it
And you think you can get with me?
(Yo, it's the L to the Q) So come and step to me
(It's the L to the Q) So come and step to me
(It's the L to the Q) So come and step to me
(It's the L to the Q) So come and step to me

[ VERSE 3: Kink E-Z ]
I'm a big shot, I'm a hot shot, give me one shot, I wreck shop
So you wanna hang with dreadlocks? Yes, I got the street smarts
Ugh, through the air like Jordan
You'll never die of boredom
You'll only hear my floor them
Cause I'm on them, and in there, so prepare to give it up
I'm on the type of shit that make a bitch wanna give it up
So what's up with the logics?
It's the Kink E-Z, and you see me in the projects
And I didn't even get hard yet, so dodge it
Watch me enlarge it, I'ma roadhog it
So you think you wanna fuck with me?
(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
(It's the Kink to the E) Don't step to me
