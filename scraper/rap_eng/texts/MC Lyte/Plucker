(Verse)
Bust it
I want y'all understand I'm down with NBC
I got so many styles that could wax a MC
I'm a kick a fresh rap and a plus I get dap
But the other MCs out here are so freakin' wack
So NBC will teach them hey, we will teach them
NBC will teach them hey, we will teach them
All about them sopps
Who think they ass down but don't get no props
What he is to Zee, he's a fucking nerve plucker (Wack mother...)
You say you can beat Zee, you lie
I freak it on your click with my shoes untied
And you are just a  never clucker
You plucking my nerves you wack mother fucker
("MC sucker" - MC Lyte)

I shot the motherfucking sheriff in sahoras
My lyrics go for seven years like broke mirrors
Zee be illin on civilans even children
Throwing biters from the roof of my buildin
The Outz like the Bush Babies
Because "We run tings and ting don't run WE"
Nah this urgent, someone call the surgeon
Zee wash the MC's mouth out with detergent
I bar-b-que avenues with mildews
And kill crews with the Jews up in Kalamazoo
So hey, hey hey Zee going loco
I'm Phat like Al without Bill Cos on my vocal
And you can put your click, anybody
Against Zee and watch me shit like on the potty
I freak the style that be too unheard
While punks like you keep plucking my nerves

(Chorus)
"You are what I label as a nerve plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker" - MC Lyte scratch 4x

(Verse)
And bust it, the gangsta rappers kick the can
Because y'all don't got no work man, the man with hands nigga
You need bullets, hurry up RUN
Before Young Zee whip out his spank and shotgun
Damn, I wax gangstas backs for fun
Acting crazy with their guns like Attila the Hun
But Zee gonna wait until all y'all come
And I guarantee you son, I'm a knock out one
Yeah yeah, when I get swoll can't none of y'all hold me
I loop an oldie, and be Da Mack like Goldie
And waving pistols is not necessary
I'll tell you straight up, none of y'all bitch niggas scare me
And if I slip and hear one nigga biting, I'm a set it
Making all y'all in this bitch start fighting (Uh-huh)
And you gonna get stomped to the curb
Cause that gangsta rap shit be plucking my nerves

(Chorus)
"You are what I label as a nerve plucker
You're plucking my nerves you MC sucker" - MC Lyte scratch 4x

(Verse)
Ohhhhhhhh child, mcs is getting real cheesier
Ohhhhhhhh,  mcs getting cornier
So I umm, I do rappers like a Box and Pop
Like body blow, uppercut, KNOCK HIM OUT!
The fast ones that flip they tongue
The crossover sellouts that's out for funds
And umm, the shook ones that quick to run
The gangsta rap liars talking about they gun
All of them, yeah yeah it's absurd
All of y'all motherfuckers be plucking my nerves

"I thought I oughtta tell you" - MC Lyte scratch
"You're plucking my nerves" 4x
"You MC sucker"
