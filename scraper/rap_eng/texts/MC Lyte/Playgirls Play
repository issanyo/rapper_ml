[Intro:]
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte
Do it, do it, do it, MC Lyte

[Verse 1:]
Ain't a damn thing changed
You know my name
East coast represent
Watch me do my thing
I'm the female chronic slash gin and tonic
Fuck Johnny Blaze, I'm Johnny Mnemonic
I'm a floss with it
Take it way past the limit
Go back 6 years and throw some G funk in it
MC Lyte long as the money green collect
This is for my dogs hittin' switches in the projects
East side and the west side
Indeed I spit it with finesse right
L's for love me, Y for "why front?"
T's for truth, E's the exotic flavor you bounce to

[Chorus:]
Lyte is... Brooklyn flavor that'll always be fresh
Lyte is... paid in full I keep my benjamins
Flippin' outfits twice a day
Plus a milked out coupe to push around the way
Grants stacking up every day all day
That's just the way playgirls play

[Verse 2:]
I'm the ultimate intergalactic spectacular
Funk mistress as creamy as Swiss Miss
Hot chocolate I'm the topic, go cop it
Broken microphones cause I rocked it
Who that Lyte? True that, right?
I'm the perfect role model for keepin' your game tight
After this I'm spending four Gs tonight
Cuz money made in the dark comes to the Lyte
Recognize through them blood shot eyes
Think my lyrical skills ain't ill you be surprised
Hypnotized by my Brooklyn vibe
Or we can take it out to Queens where Cool J resides

[Chorus] (2x)

[Verse 3:]
You're transparent incoherent
Oh you don't know that word
Let me make it more apparent
I sit on chrome stake up chips run up charts
Break up schemes cause wet dreams
Engine engine number 9 on the NY transit line
If you want that flavor back
Lyte it up, Lyte it up, Lyte it up
Who am I? L Y T E
How fly? Oh I'm real jiggy
It's no puzzle how I through the muzzle on the mic
Cuff your CD make it spin all night
I got what you like you like what I got
Hotter than gun shots hotter than most blocks
Hot hot hot to the touch pop the clutch
I won't stop
Larger than life, the most jiggiest
Rippin all the mics apart
I'm gettin' busy
It's all about the cheddar
Nobody do the body better
Never sour but flow like an Amaretta
It's the Lyte y'all, I'm about to take flight
Brooklyn zone got it locked up tight
Show biz your biz doe biz my biz
There it is

[Chorus]
