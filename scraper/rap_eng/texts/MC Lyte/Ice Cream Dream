[Intro]
I wish I had an ice cream that looked just like you
Sweet tasting chocolate all the way through
I'd lick you slow from head to toe…

My ice cream
Yeah, my ice cream dream
Just the way I like it

[Verse 1]
Sweet dreams, from this don't wake me
You couldn't even if you tried to shake me
What do ya want ‘cause I’m in a deep sleep
No nightmare here, dear, I’m talking chocolate treat
Slick and slippery, thick it’s gotta be
It’s mandatory that I make him a part of me
I'll make the dream last ‘cause it seems
I can only have him, in my ice cream dream

[Hook: Lisa Keith]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream

[Verse 2]
Sweet as candy, a physique for show
I’mma let him know we can go toe for toe
Hip to hip, lip to lip, and then lock it
Big fat feet means big fat pockets
Trick or treat, tasty like pastry
Hmm, I wonder has he had any lately
Ready to hit it if you know what I mean
‘Cause homie seems to be like an ice cream dream

[Hook]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream

[Verse 3]
Dark, handsome, six feet tall
31 flavors, I believe he’s got ‘em all
Slippin’ and slidin’ and oozin’ down the cone
Hope he doesn’t melt before I get him home
Drip drop, come on, feed me, Seymour
Take some now, I know later there’ll be more
We got the best, it seems you’re the king
You’re the man in the picture of my ice cream dream

[Hook 2X]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream

Goody, goody
Yeah
Uh huh
Mmm…

[Verse 4]
Smooth and rich, he’s looking real nice
Cool as ice, but then again, not quite
This kind of honey is the type I like looking at
He could scoop me up twice ‘cause he’s all that
So I’mma ease up, no time to waste
Forget the chase, I’m prepared to get a taste
Licky here, licky there ‘cause I like it
Too much to eat so I guess I’ll…bite it

Goody, goody; goody, goody
Yeah
He’s my ice cream dream

[Hook 2X]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream
