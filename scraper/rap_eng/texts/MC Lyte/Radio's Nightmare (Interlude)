With a uh-uh here
A uh-uh there
Here a huh, there a huh
Everywhere a uh-uh
MC Lyte, she had a jam
Sam I am, I cram to understand
Now how many licks
Does it take for you to get
From the center of my clit
To the tops of my tits
Aww, shit
Did I see spit?
Can't forget
Easy to get with
Now lickety my [?]
Let's make it fit like a ball in a mitt
It's hot
Now drop it to the bottom of the pit
Like the bottom of the pot
Is filled with some thick shit
But what's you hit it
It's too legit to quit
Let's seek out the loser from the winner
Though the winner doesn't always
Have to start as a beginner
[?] I am humpin and bumpin and [?]
All over the jam
You're everything that I thought you were and more
Now watch it swing three inches from the floor
You're the bomb I know, baby, like a monstar
But I can't get your feet out the back of my [?]
