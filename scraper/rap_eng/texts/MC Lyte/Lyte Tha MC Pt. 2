Don't get it twisted, I'm still unlisted
And that Shyne from Bad Boy, I'm still bumpin' it
Yeah, me and my music, we's a custom fit
It's that noise you bring, I can't do nothing with it
When I ball through your hood it's like something hit
It's remarkable, never heard this flow before, uh
Like to keep it fresh, gotta keep it raw
Maad Phunk got beats and Lyte's got lyrics, uh
Can't you hear it, all go for the spirit
Ain't no maiden, they broke the mould when they made me
BK baby in navy looking shapely
They tried to follow but they can't copy me
And when they do it done, huns do it sloppily
I got joints for the street, joints for the club
Joints for radio, hits to rub it up
No one can do it like I do it when I broke through

You can't touch me, don't you see, Lyte as a rock
I'm the one you been tryna please, Lyte the MC nigga
Roll back you get swoll back, I'm tryna breathe, I am the Lyte now
For all you fake ass Lyte MC's, Lyte the MC, there's only one me baby

Don't get messed up
I just got back but you still gon' have to catch up
I make 'em fess up
I'm proud, when I walk up in the room I keep my chest up
I never lost, I never lose, I never will cause I'm ill
And know it, I got skills
You leave this here up to the pioneers
Fall back, play it rear, every year's my year, yeah
BK set it and I will have to debt it
If you challenge me, can't a nigga silence me
You too little, too late to try and rest, uh
We don't even really care what's on your wrist
Keep it to yourself
These heads barely got enough to buy your little CD off the shelf
What's the result, they go broke
While you screamin' bout ya 22's, gleamin' in your shiny boat
Say it if you're hot, we gon' see it if you're not

You can't touch me, don't you see, Lyte as a rock
I'm the one you been tryna please, Lyte the MC
Roll back you get swoll back, I'm tryna breathe, I am the Lyte now
For all you fake ass Lyte MC's, Lyte the MC, there's only one me baby

I lays tracks and leave behind the rookies
Outdance the majors, they thought they shook me
I'm hook be, hip-hop's my aphrodisiac
Never catch me in no sleazy act, I ain't a easy act
Spit hotness on tracks, all day I'm the cure
Spit fire, bring heat to ya floor
Bang lyrics till our chin be sore, my word is all I have
Nasty is the craft, dark flow the half
Gotta love it when we all come through because
You is me and I is you, listen
Reppin' for the hood, gotta give 'em a taste
Step them onto the stage, feel the embrace
Only here cause you let me, now you cool cause you met me
Here's the goods babe, don't forget me
Lytro, two feet, now bust a leak

You can't touch me, don't you see, Lyte as a rock
I'm the one you been tryna please, Lyte the MC nigga
Roll back you get swoll back, I'm tryna breathe, I am the Lyte now
For all you fake ass Lyte MC's, Lyte the MC, there's only one me baby
