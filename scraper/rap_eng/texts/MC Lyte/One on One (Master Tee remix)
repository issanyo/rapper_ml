Yeah! Uh! Uh yeah! Wooh!
Smooth, better than I've ever seen him
As I flip the Vibe Book
He's on the front page
Never Looking his age
He's all that and I'm all in
So let the games begin
Now I'ma give ya something
So you could get in to it
I got the side view so
I could watch it
You've been on my mind
But your're so hard to find
Hollywood's got a hold on
That behind
I ain't ashamed to play the game
Listen here I won't say no names
Put your ass out
Make your woman put your ass out
If you Knew that I was talking to you
You would pass out cause
I gave you bo type of indication and
If I did I was probably on the some medication
I got the hots for you
Daddy and I just begun
Lets do this- one on one

Chorus:
One (8X)
I wanna play that game
One (8X)
Just you and me baby one on one
Half way acroos the world
I seen you at my show
Wit your girl
Back in italy but you
Are still into me
Causeif you are-
I'm here to let ya know
You don't have to be a superstar
For me and you to go far
Now I ain't never lied
You got the body of an angel
Bango, bango
Watch the bojangle from every angle
I'm clocking you honey
We could sign a prenup
I got my own money
I just wanna get to know you
A little better in the lyte
After dark
On the DL
Whatever
I wanna feel your muscle flex off your backbone
I got the jones and I can't leave you alone
I wanna rub your deltoid down to your bi-cep
Better late than never
And I'm sorry I slept but now I'm
Well awake and I'm ready for the fun
Let's do this- one on one
Chorus
Damn- the only brother make me look twice
Believe that baby
I wanna sacrifice
I'm on it- you couldn't shake me off
If you tried
No sleeping on the job and
I'm wide-eyed
I like the video you got out
The song is butter
Try to keep a clean head and my mind
Out the gutter
But it's hard- you bring out the best and the worst
If you way back when I
Would've let you hit it first
Love, its like water on the brain
Only you can tame this run away train
Last time I seen ya- geam in your eye
You was looking fly with your girl
By your side
Shit, I ain't trying take her place
I just wanna have your face
All up in my space
I got the hots for ya and I just begun
You and me baby- one on one
Chorus
Ha! Yeah!
Just you baby and me
One on one
