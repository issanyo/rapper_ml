Make it last long, uha, uh

Here's a situation, skip the talk
Let me know dog if you bite or bark
What it is soldier, you ready to march
Can you make me shoot, or you just soft
Cause I got no time for the games
Just keep my spine full of pain
Hit the boost and hit turbo
In this sexual inferno
Keep my lovin', drippin' drains
Or love highway, switchin' lanes
Show me different thangs with the whip and chains
Hit you with this grippin' pain
Can you handle that, are you alright
Test me out, is it alright
Come on baby, you ain't finished
You servin' time, I ain't talkin' minutes

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Certified misses, I'm misses
Only get my time if it's
Somethin' that stay somethin'
All night, until brunch and
Hit it right, manouvre me
Take your big knot, ? me
Pull my hair back, who the ruler be
Lovin' you so tight, no room for three
Tell me you want me
My love keep you horny
I know's my mother on me
Stay away from the masculine
Thing that keep me needing asperin
Got me gaspin' in for air, pashin' and
Sheets satin and mixed with silk
Here's my love, mixed with milk

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
What does it feel like

Check me out, feminine engine
Brooklyn girl, read the emblem
Him, them, and that's hangin'
Ten, it's nine-eight and then
Till it's hot and you got me bent
On top of my thing, you win
Came nine times, going for the tenth
Think you could hang if you attempt
With energy, when you enter me, hold on
Goin' for a ride, hope you don't fold on
Me, when we in the midst
Of battlin' with my slip
No babblin', close your lips
Get close to it, nothing close to this
Feelin' what I feel when I'm next to you
I stretch for you, please stretch me too
Night got me right as we take the flight
Through the clouds of love, highest heights
My thing's tighter than a Jew's pockets
Think you used to it, go head, rock it

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Give me what I want tonight, make it last long

Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
Make it hot for me, I'm Lyte if you comin' strong
