Face off 'cause your shit is twisted
Screw off your mouth 'cause this chick is gifted
I stay whippin' in something you never seen
Ain't into flossin' but I could put it on some
Call 'em at the crib
Tell 'em you just lost 1, 2 & 3
I'm about to run a Boston
On son, how come I'm on one?
I'm born free, you born dumb
I pack a fortune
My time is too much for what it's costing
Hear any chick on the mic, you know I taught 'em
What you just might get
Is a chick that spit that wiz priceless
I made a decision to play my position
And this is the place in my life
Where I start delivering, you know why?
This game ain't got nothing on me
None after, none before me
I put the work in, I want the glory
Here's my chance to tell my story
