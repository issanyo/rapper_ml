Girlfriend's story ft. mc lyte
(mc lyte)
So sad she didn't make it
Its time for us to fight back
Can't believe what he did that day
Hit her up and pulled her hair
No good he kept her fearful
Every night he gave her an earful
Don't do that don't do this
Husband so clueless
Her mum had no idea
That he wasn't playin fair
Her child was young
Damn she thought thast she could manage
Didn't think this fool would ever take
Advantage
Not only was he roofless
Ontop of that he was stupid
And thats how women suffer
I think we had enougha!

Everyday she would call me with another story said her man is treatin he so bad
Said this cnt be the same girl thought your man was your world can't you see he's makin you so sad
He creeps upon you daily leaves you with the baby
You won't leave oh go away
Its all upto you girl he don't have a clue girl

Girlfriend
You know you was the best he ever had
Got woke up in the night see
Blue light shinin brightly
Heard screams they said the girl was dead
Caought up in a domestic
Said she could've left it
Death was caused by injury to her head
I can't believe your gone girl
What about your son girl
Girl how could you die this way
For you i say a prayer girl
Put that man in jail girl
I'll miss you friend

To all my ladies if you feel me
