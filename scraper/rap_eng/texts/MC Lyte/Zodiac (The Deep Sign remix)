Libra, Cancer Gemini, Pisces, what's your zodiac sign
Aries Aquarius, Taurus, Sagitarius, Leo, Virgo
Capricorn, Scorpio, when were you born, What's your sign

One zero the month of the year
I'm not a hero but I come when in despair
I float like the wind, the mighty air sign
When I use my mind its not hard to find
Those who would not like to see me fly
Rather step on my wings and watch me die
But that can never be I use my skills
Postitive, negative energy male and female
Emotions within me Leo, Aquarius compatibility
Also Gemini but I got four eyes for one set of twins
I look deep within
Often distracted by pretty little things
Like the wings of an angel or the song they may sing
Argumentative but I hate confrontation
Ruled by Venus and starked with hesitation
Procrastincator, never an instigator
You wanna riff homie I'll see you later
Sapphire, My type of jewel
I turn on one who thinls he knows me too well
Like the water barrier with the million dollar smile
Flowing like the Nile or the waters from the Panama canal
Pisces a fabulous catch
They remain detached
Yet to find a match
Don't lose your breath waiting to exhale, I shall prevail
Weighing souls on the scale
Follow me as we take this trip through astrology
The galaxy from Pluto to Mercury
What ya gonna do when the planets line up
Your time is up and your city blows up
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I fear none
I'm at one with the sun till I'm done
Astrologically speaking on the track
Dropping solar facts about the zodiac
The sun and the mooon and the stars
Make up the universe Earth is not far from the planet Mars
Virgo the virgin running from the twins
Stung by the Scorpio running through the Lions den
Ram with legs of a crab
With the half man half horse waiting in the past
Of course if you check the math its all symbolical
Horoscopes are purely logic
