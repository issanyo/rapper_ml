Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go (ooh)
Bout time  (ooh ooh) bout time  (ooh ooh)
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go

Gotta getaway
Gotta do it now
I gotta step into the sun, ha ha
You see I'm leaving baby, on the midnight train to Georgia
Nobody to blame, I feel the same
To many days filled with rain
I can't take the pain
I must maintain
After all these years
Isn't it strange
That to remain sane
I've gotta make a change

If you're thinking about moving away
And you can't come out to play
Don't you know it's gonna hurt so much inside
And all these feelings you can't deny
And don't you know that if you walk outside that door
Leaving me here howling for more
I guess I'll have to follow you (follow you)
And I'll watch everything that you do, baby

Gotta go, gotta go
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh ooh)
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go
Oh yeah

So I see you've gotta ticket all the way
Regardless of what I say
Don't you know I can't hear none of that (mmm)
Yeah maybe I'm a little cracked (ooh)
Any if by chance we find love
As real as the sky above (yeah)
Gonna go all around the world
Cos I'm a part of everything you do baby
Baby I've got to go

Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go gotta go (ooh ooh)
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh ooh)
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go

Baby I'm missing you
Yeah my heart broke right in two (mmm)
The pain hurts slowly
You're my one and only (yeah)
Baby I wanna be kissing you
Smacking those lips until they fall in two (mmm)
I'm so lonely
Girl I wanna be kissing you

Gotta go, gotta go
Bout time (ooh ooh) bout time
Boy I'm thinking about leaving you
Gotta go, gotta go (I love you)
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go(ooh)
Bout time, but I love you, bout time, baby I love you
Gotta go, gotta go
Hey
Gotta go, gotta go (ooh)

You're not an (?OP) like Bootsie
But I still believe
Till you show all the tricks up your sleeve
Indeed I proceed with caution, got you thinking
About the love that you lost
But damn
I gotta leave you know
You can't go
I need time to grow
I'm ready and heading to the next plateau
If you see me uptown, Riverside Drive
Do me this baby dog
Just walk on by, this is life
(bout time (ooh ooh) bout time)
I've gotta leave
I've gotta go
I've gotta leave
I gotta go
I gotta leave
I got to go
