[Intro]
Hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Just hold me down
Hold me down
Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy-ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy-ayy

[Chorus]
Hold me down so I can bless you (hold me down so I can bless you)
I'm comin' for the rescue (I'm comin' for the rescue)
Girl, I'll be there to save the day (girl, I'll be there to save the day)
You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)
I'm comin' straight to you (I'm comin' straight to you)
I'm on my way to you (I'm on my way to you)
I'm runnin' out things to say (I'm runnin' out things to say)
But I got some things I wanna do to you (some things I wanna do to you)

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna show you I appreciate you (I appreciate you)
Tonight I wanna prove to you (I wanna prove to you)
I flew to you without my cape (I flew to you without my cape)
Went out my way to save you (went out my way to save you)
My homies tellin' me don't save that girl (tellin' me don't save that girl)
But girl, I'm gonna save you (but girl, I'm gonna save you)
I'll buy you what you say, ooh (I'll buy you what you say, ooh)
I love you like I made you (I love you like I made you)

[Verse 1]
I'm scared to show you how I feel
I ain't got no heart, but you the one that make me feel
How you would you take it, if I show you how I feel?
It's somethin' bout you, I ain't even know that I could feel
Say you ain't the one, but I'm rockin' with you still
Ain't about the sex, girl, we could Netflix, we could chill
I'm here to stay, I love you like you my kid
And by the way, I want you to have my kid
My homie told me no, baby girl, I'm gonna save her
I think they might be right, I'm just gon' regret it later
Money over bitches, but girl, I love you like the paper
'Cause when you with me, I don't even want to get no paper

[Chorus]
Hold me down so I can bless you (hold me down so I can bless you)
I'm comin' for the rescue (I'm comin' for the rescue)
Girl, I'll be there to save the day (girl, I'll be there to save the day)
You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)
I'm comin' straight to you (I'm comin' straight to you)
I'm on my way to you (I'm on my way to you)
I'm runnin' out things to say (I'm runnin' out things to say)
But I got some things I wanna do to you (some things I wanna do to you, baby)

[Verse 2]
I stopped hangin' with my homies, ain't listen to 'em
They tried to tell me you wasn't for me, ain't listen to 'em
That you my motherfuckin' one, you got me whipped
And I done chased you like the money
I like the way you walk, like the way you flip your hair
Too easy to give up, I wanna show you that I care
I'ma treat you like my shooter, me and you, girl, we're a pair
I'ma treat you like my food, baby, I don't wanna share, you
Make me forget that I'm a jit 'cause when I'm witcha
I don't even think about the streets
And when I'm witcha, I don't even wanna hear no beats
And if you leavin', I don't even know how I'ma breath

[Chorus]
Hold me down so I can bless you (hold me down so I can bless you)
I'm comin' for the rescue (I'm comin' for the rescue)
Girl, I'll be there to save the day (girl, I'll be there to save the day)
You know I love to make your day (you know I love to make your day)
I'm comin' straight to you (I'm comin' straight to you)
I'm on my way to you (I'm on my way to you)
I'm runnin' out things to say (I'm runnin' out things to say)
But I got some things I wanna do to you (some things I wanna do to you)

[Post-Chorus]
Wanna show you I appreciate you (I appreciate you)
Tonight I wanna prove to you (I wanna prove to you)
I flew to you without my cape (I flew to you without my cape)
Went out my way to save you (went out my way to save you)
My homies tellin' me don't save that girl (tellin' me don't save that girl)
But girl, I'm gonna save you (but girl, I'm gonna save you)
I'll buy you what you say, ooh (I'll buy you what you say, ooh)
I love you like I made you (I love you like I made you)
