[Intro]
Ain't no pussy in my heart
Never ever ever been
All loyal in my heart

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart (To the heart)
These niggas don't know how to play they part (Play yo part)
Never been no pussy in my heart (in my heart)
I always kept it real from the start (from the start)
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart (bitch give me back my heart)
And if I see her, I might catch a charge (nigga give me back my heart)
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart

[Verse 1]
Damn I got to run here go the narcs
Sniper gang, I hit you wit a dart
I don't do no pillow talkin' that ain't in my heart
I was playin' round wit that poker, you was playin' round in the park
I ain't waitin' for tomorrow, kept it real since day one
Like I exercise, me and jack been down from the jump
I ain't brawlin' man, I ain't got no time tryna thump
Ima garbage man nigga if I see you ima dump
That loyalty will get you outta thangs when you stuck
Around here that sour shit you on get you plucked
I ain't nothin' like these niggas, where the hell these niggas from
I ain't fuckin' wit these niggas, they'll tell on they son

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart
These niggas don't know how to play they part
It Never been no pussy in my heart
I always kept it real from the start
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart

[Verse 2]
If I see her, I might shoot the bitch
I should've treated her like any other groupie chick
I keep my heart pumpin blood, never koolaid
I'm up before the sun, ain't been sleep in 2 days
I told her my name Kodak, she said oh like blu-ray
All these niggas tryna follow me, I went a new way
That loyalty get you a long way
An I ain't never switch, ain't never threw shade
These niggas don't know how to play they role
They act like paper, all they do is fold
These streets ain't for lil kids, get out the road
That loyalty more valuable than gold

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart
These niggas don't know how to play they part
It Never been no pussy in my heart
I always kept it real from the start
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart
