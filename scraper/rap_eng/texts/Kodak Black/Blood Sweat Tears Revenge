[Intro]
Damn..
It's like, it's like once a nigga got in this lil situation everybody stop fucking with me, dawg
They throwing salt on my name
Shit cray
I'm staying down though man
I'm staying solid man I be back out there soon

[Verse 1]
Since a young nigga, nobody couldn't tell me shit
It's Lil Kodak, Project baby coming straight out the bricks
Section 8, where everyone here living off W.I.C
If you lookin' for me, I'm somewhere hittin' a lick
In a rental car, I'm somewhere taking a trip
Keep my head on a swivel, out here you gotta be swift
Lord this is my last trip, forgive me for my sins
On my lonely, road runnin, tryna get to them bands
I done shook back, I'm right back at it again
Puttin' them crosses on the window now I'm gone in the wind
In this life that I live, I learned a lot about friends
And how they just like these bitches because all they do is pretend
Hoes will wanna ride for you if you got your money right
Do anything for you, suck your dick all night
They say they love you forever
They say they with you for life
Soon as shit go sour, them hoe catchin' a flight
I remember those days when I was heated them nights
Cause all I wanted was my people to send me a kite
I done bounced right back, they can't believe they eyes
Everybody tellin' lies say ya boy caught a dime

[Verse 2]
They say we don't fuck with Kodak no more
He done went ghost
We ain't listening to his songs no more, he done fell off
He like another average Joe, like I ain't gonna blow
They talkin' bout me like a hoe they talkin' down on me
Tellin' lies on me, say I caught 11 years
I done lost a lot of friends, shed plenty tears
Could've hung me by my throat and cut my fucking ears
Stay solid, had to do my bid, now I'm here
Road runnin' for that money, we in Chesterfield
You know they say shit real when you in the field
Had to get it how I live, that's just what it is
Tried to put my nigga on, but he fucking squealed
I remember those nights geekin' off a pill
I was real lil with my body full of pills
That lil Haitian out his mind toting big steel
Look at him he pourin' molly in the Zephyrhills
