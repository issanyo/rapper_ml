[Intro]
(Plugoz on the beat and I'm killin' it)
Damn who make this beat, 'cause I'm stealin' it

Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
You can't spark my flame now I'm lit
I might snatch ya' chain and ya' bitch

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
You can't spark my flame, cause now I'm lit
I might snatch ya' chain and ya' bitch

[Verse 1: John Wicks & Kodak Black]
Thinking when I ain't had shit
They was always pickin' on my kicks
Catch me in the mall with the shit
Comin' from the Projects now I'm rich
Remember when I had to hit a lick
Now I'm flashin' on these niggas, take a pic
Look baby, I ain't got no time for this
Shawty said she wanna have my jit
All this flavor, I be saucin' on a bitch
All this flavor, I be droppin' when I drip
Sniper gang, we mobbin' in this shit
I'm leakin' like a faucet on the wrist
That robbin' put these diamonds on my necklace
You walkin' while I pull up in the Tesla
I'mma take yo' lady 'cause she special
I keep the pipe, 'cause I'mma bust it if there's pressure

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
You can't spark my flame now I'm lit
I might snatch ya' chain and ya' bitch

[Verse 3: Jack Boy & Kodak Black]
Been goin' hard, think I need to rest up
Been goin' hard, 'cause really I'm like next up
Ran up that bread, fuck niggas can't catch up
Run up you dead, we spray you from the neck up
Keep yo' two cents, you broke, fuck yo' lecture
Don't want pressure, my snipers goin' extra
Don't you test us, like teachers we give lessons (Yeah, baby)
Cross 'em out, Sniper we gon' X 'em
Hey Jack Boy, this her first time ridin' in a foreign car
Ay, but she just don't know that it's a stolen car
Switch the VIN number, now this shit here mine now
I'm on house arrest, but I still be ridin' around
And I can't wife ya up, I can't be tied down
I put the lighter up, but I can't put the fire down
Just bought a AP, went lit up my wrist gang
G1 taught me right I got that whip gang
The industry they hit a lick on Biscayne
Fuck the industry I'm in the streets for real mayne
I'd like to stick around niggas say they in the field 'til they get blitzed

[Hook]
Sniper Gang, John Wicks
Homie, you can't hang with my klik
You can't spark my flam now I'm lit
I might snatch ya' chain and ya' bitch
