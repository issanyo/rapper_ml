[Intro]
Aye, Khaos
Bitch you wouldn't believe bih
I just woke up, ainna
Just 'bout a few hours ago so you know I'm roamin' around
I did my thug dizzle
Hopped in the spray
I got out the spray, walked out the door and...
I seen my dream girl

[Chorus]
Baby girl you a movie, you done got Kodak off BluRay
I'ma have to buy you a new ring
We should get married today
I'ma put you in a new place
Baby girl we can be roommates
Lemme know what you wanna do bae
All I really want is you bae

[Verse 1]
I'm so groovy
Smoother than smoothie
Baby girl you beautiful, but I'm stuck on yo' booty
I put you in a blue Wraith
You ridin' in a new wave
In South Beach ridin' on yachts, bae we in a new wave
Baby girl I don't wanna lose you
I'ma have to put you on voodoo
Baby girl I don't wanna lose you
I'ma have to put you on voodoo
You makin' me freestyle
You makin' my cheeks smile
Girl you know that I'm G Code, but you bringing my sweet out
I ain't hit a hood in a week now
I ain't even been in the streets now
I just wanna freak and skeet now
I just wanna eat and sleep now
Figured out what I wanna be now
Hold me down 'cause I wanna be down
Yeah, girl I wanna have ya like I need now
Girl I had to grab ya like a rebound
Trust me, I like yo' body, but baby I love yo' smile
You don't even need a stylist, 'cause you got so much style
Answer FaceTime like "Wow!"
Answer FaceTime right now
I ain't catch butterflies in a while
Answer FaceTime right now

[Chorus]
Baby girl you a movie, you done got Kodak off BluRay
I'ma have to buy you a new ring
We should get married today
I'ma put you in a new place
Baby girl we can be roommates
Lemme know what you wanna do bae
All I really want is you bae

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's too much fishes in the sea though
But I fucked around found Nemo
I believe she my dream girl
So I'ma chase my dreams though
I might go and put you on YouTube
I might have to put you on Vevo
Already had you 'fore I met you
But baby you boost my ego
Even though this just a lil' song
We done ran down on foolie
We done ran down on foolie
Bih we ran down on foolie
I redid the Hit, fuck Sudie
Nigga everybody for Sudie
No disrespect Sudie, this music
But nigga everybody for Sudie
Dropped Project Baby, now I'm 'bout to drop Project Baby 2 bih
This a teaser, I'm just rollin' but I'm sober
Nigga I ain't gotta be booted
I don't even know what I'm doin'
I'm just freestyling for you bae
'Cause I don't wanna lose bae
Put that pussy on my teeth like toothpaste

[Outro]
Put that pussy on my diamonds like toothpaste
I'ma tie ya down like shoe lace
I'ma tie ya down, you a shoe face ass
Fuck with ya crew face ass
