[Hook: Kodak Black]
Hit 'em up, go go, hit that man
Stick 'em up, go go, get them bands
Finesse your man up out them bands, your mans
Goddamn he broke, he need an ambulance

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Hit 'em up, go go, hit that man
Stick 'em up, go go, get them bands
Finesse your man up out them bands, your mans

[Verse 1: Nino Breeze]
I say my bitch look like a goddess
My wrist, that bitch retarded
My whip look like a monster
I'm balling like I'm sponsored
My traphouse it go bonkers
My metro it go dumbo
Got to duck on dodo's spot
That's where we stash them hundreds
Grip it like a gun show
All this powder stay on deck
All these shawtys stay on neck
Bought the Jag and you get [?]
Bust a pack and move it back
I ain't got no time to waste
I just got this cash to get
Foreign whip designer taste
Louis V around the waist
Sold that boy a pound of shake
18, think [?] wanna sell
Fuckboy what you tryna say, tryna say?
This for the mofos and stolos
Gripping they four-fours and ochos
Soon as your mo chose, my door close
She bout to go go for promo

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Hit 'em up, go go, hit that man
Stick 'em up, go go, get them bands
Finesse your man up out them bands, your mans
Goddamn he broke, he need an ambulance

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm so turned up in this bitch
I'm doing my damn dance
I don't know whats up with your bitch
She pullin' my damn pants
Free my niggas in the pen
Hold your head man
How these niggas sleepin' on me?
Think they on a xan
Holiday Inn, shawty doing a handstand
Now you in here sucking dick, I thought you was a fan
Dead presidents, fuck a coffin, buried 'em in my pants
Gave that bitch the [?], thought we was standing hand in hand

[Verse 3: Nino Breeze]
Chopper go blam blam blam
Turn heads like an ambulance
Chains on hammer dance
Bitch I need a cameraman
Y'all don't stand a chance
Me I just can't stand to lie
That why I can't stand these hoes
I got no why for you, know why?
Got no stripes, and you [?]
My whole life I been that guy
It ain't no taxing on this side
Cause boy your price is way too high
My advice is that you try
That you tries to catch a plug
Cause if you tries to catch me slipping
Then you tryna catch a slug
Turn up, turn up

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Hit 'em up, go go, hit that man
Stick 'em up, go go, get them bands
Finesse your man up out them bands, your mans
Goddamn he broke, he need an ambulance

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Hit 'em up, go go, hit that man
