[Hook: Young Scooter]
I made it out the hood, my niggas good
These niggas hating cause I made it out the hood
Shootin' dice playing poker, cooking dope
Jugging bales, that's what happen in the hood
It's a lot of real niggas
Bitch you know it's steal and snitch in each and every fucking hood
I would never cross my niggas
They gon' ride for me nigga, Young Scooter and I put that on my hood

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
50 racks in the bank, I'm in the hood shooting CeeLos
Cost a whole 100 thousand, beat that case in Ohio
Never sold a dog food, let that sit off the Rallo
When I move, they streets move, it's a go, I'mma say so
Got that 50 bricks of white in the truck on the back street
Making children stay away but we meet up like a track meet
Pull off in a 2 litre, that shit stop my heart beat
I won't never see you fake rappers out in these dirty streets
You say you from the hood, you better keep it real
Long way up out that money, I won't ever deal
I got remix dope jumping out the bail
I just spent 5 mil out the hood I'm in

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I made it out the hood, my niggas good
These niggas hating cause I made it out the hood
Shootin' dice playing poker, cooking dope
Jugging bales, that's what happen in the hood
It's a lot of real niggas
Bitch you know it's steal and snitch in each and every fucking hood
I would never cross my niggas
They gon' ride for me nigga, Young Scooter and I put that on my hood

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I put that on my mama, I'm a road runner
If this load drop, it gon' be a cold summer
Sometimes I wonder how the fuck I keep from going under
Sometimes I wonder how the fuck I made it out the drug
Keep up under them books like a librarian
Booty onion, I'mma motherfucking barbarian
You remember when we caught a case [?]?
You remember that little altercation way in Maryland
You know that money dirty, had to do my laundry
But now that money clean, yup, money laundering
VA, I hit for 30, I went down for larceny
Lord you know I'm living dirty, here's to doing robbery

[Hook: Young Scooter]
I made it out the hood, my niggas good
These niggas hating cause I made it out the hood
Shootin' dice playing poker, cooking dope
Jugging bales, that's what happen in the hood
