[Intro]
Boy I'm higher than a bih [?]
I need some weed, I need to calm down fire that shit up
Aye John

[Hook]
I need to vibe 'cause I'm [?] right now
So I'm firin' up the crypt right now
Cause I'm higher than a bih right now
I'll turn this whole shit upside down

[Verse 1]
Stop lyin' on ya dick
If you hit her, then you hit
Stop lyin' on a bih
Everybody know ya snitched
Stop ridin' on my dick, why you worried 'bout me?
Pop one, pop two, pop three
Fuck the law, I ain't worried 'bout a plea
Fuck the alphabet, boy I just copped a QP
See me when ya see me, it's Lil' K to the B
On my Kyocera, my lick just called me for them D's
I'm on E, pockets full, I'm on E
Ski with the Ree's, I could pull a couple G
Ten toes down, I can put you on yo' feet
Don't slow me down, roadrunnin' full speed
So high, I never felt like this
I'm so high, I'm 'bout to beat my bitch
I'm so high, it got my teeth grindin'
But fuck it, I'm just gon' keep slidin', 'cause the beat ridin'
I used to swim in the money, now I'm deep divin'
I swear I'm higher than a bih, it got me freestylin'
She say "Boy I never felt like this"
I told her "Shut up and eat my dick"
Aye pass the joint, you know sharin' is carin'
I'm so high, I'm just sittin' here starin'
(Kodak what you lookin' at? You zoned out)
'Bout that money, I'll shoot out to Maryland
All these books, you'd think I'm a librarian
I bumped into a powerhouse, [?]
You keep grindin', you can get a McLaren
