[intro]
You know your worth a-lot, i'm just saying baby your my dream, the only one four me
I wan't to hold you tight call you up late night's, i never mention your friends to my friend's
Your body rocking to imperfection's, i just wan't to rock with you i will never forget you
I sure do miss the ways you treated me, holding me tight saying if i lived you would even need me
You the one for me trust nobody but me, are love to deep

[hook]
Baby i swear the thing's i do is not the reason why i left you my heart is unbreakable
Us together would even make a grate couple, what should we do cause you know i need you
Everyday hard baby just stick with me you know i got your back
So many played with your feeling's it like you can't find love
Just look to the guy speaking to you that the one who gonna ride with you
