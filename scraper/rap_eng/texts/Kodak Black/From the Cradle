[Intro]
Okay
Just keep, just keep me recordin', I don't care
Sometimes I don't be knowin' what I wanna name my songs and I just be flowin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I don't want no relations, lil' mama, we can't be laid up, no
I'm from Golden Acres, but now I'm sittin' on acres, ayy
I don't want no relations, you know that I got me a lady, baby
Me and Lil DJ tight, we gon' rock to the grave from the cradle
House with a lake, no neighbors and links on my wrist, no bailiff (Ayy)
House with a lake, no neighbors and links on my wrist, no bailiff (Ayy)

[Verse]
Ayy, I can't fathom if you play with me
Yeah, I'd be happy if you stayed with me
Ayy, I'ma get in that pussy and dance in it
Baby, I need your tender lovin' and carin'
Ooh, all these VV diamonds transparent
Ooh, drinkin' Molly like the cranberry
Yeah, I can't fathom if you play with me
Ayy, I'd be happy if you stayed with me
I promise I love you, Kayla, Jayla and Karen
I'm honest, I love you Alexis, Chelsea and Tara
You Cazzie, baby, you mean the world to me
Ooh, I love you so much, I want the world to see
Ayy, and Twanisha, I want me another chance
Babe, you got me, don't need no other man
Yeah, and I've been fuckin' with you, I go up, baby
I don't know what I'ma do if you run, baby
I've been fuckin' with you, I go up
I don't know what I'ma do if you run
I've been fuckin' with you since I was a youngin'
I'ma put a baby in you 'cause you deserve it
I'ma put a lil' seed right in your stomach
You be right where I be, on 1800

[Chorus]
Ayy, I don't want no relations, lil' mama, we can't be laid up, no
I'm from Golden Acres, but now I'm sittin' on acres, ayy
I don't want no relations, you know that I got me a lady, baby
Me and Lil DJ tight, we gon' rock to the grave from the cradle
House with a lake, no neighbors and links on my wrist, no bailiff (Ayy)
House with a lake, no neighbors and links on my wrist, no bailiff (Ayy)

[Outro]
Ayy, I'm like how can I breathe when you be gone?
Ain't tryna see the police 'cause I be runnin'
I'm like how can I breathe when you be gone?
Ain't tryna see the police 'cause I be runnin'
I see you fuckin' with me, I'm catchin' on
I'm gon' put a lil' seed right in your tummy, ayy
I see you fuckin' with me, I'm catchin' on
I see you fuckin' with me, I'm catchin' on
I'm gon' put a lil' seed right in your tummy
Ain't tryna see the police 'cause I be runnin'
I'm like how can I breathe when you be gone?
I see you fuckin' with me, I'm catchin' on
I'm gon' put a lil' seed right in your stomach, ayy
