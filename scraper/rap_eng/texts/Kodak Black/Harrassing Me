[Verse 1] : Kodak Black
Got my phone chirping, you steady snapping told you bitch im working im in traffic

Can't be laid up cause im gone, if i wasn't paid up you wouldn't be blowing up my phone
Why you worried bout them hoes, you be with that bullshit im bout to leave yo ass alone

You dont wanna leave me alone, calling me about what you heard

Bitch you must be tricking you know im always working i ain't got time for no hoe
You acting like you wanna leave its up to you to go cause i ain't got no time for this fuck shit no more
