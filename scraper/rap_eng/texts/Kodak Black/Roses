[Verse 1]
Baby girl lets take it slow
Come and let me hold you close
Like a garden outta all the girls you standoutÂ  just like a rose
You make the world seem less vile
I swear i love to see you smile
You bring this joy inside a nigga that's been gone for a while
When im with you i be geeking
Tryna see you on the weekend
If i said i wasn't feeling you,lord knows id be tweaking
Feelings higher than the ceiling
Love sick,no penicillin
If i gave you my heart would you take it or would you kill it

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?


[Verse 2]
Cheri you got me sentimental
Got ppl being judgemental
Why you love that girl so much
On god its just so simple
You bring out the best in me
I swear i love your charisma
You're my lil blessing
You're the nala to my simba
You're my lil queen from haiti
I've been in my feelings lately
Thinking bout you,reminiscing
Shit just been so crazy baby
But through it all it didn't faze me
Cause girl you're still amazing
Let's go off and do our own shit and the world behind,gazing
I know how it is now
I know how i feel now
Im tryna grow now,me with you
Girl you is my lifeline
Fuck a facetime
Im tryna link now,so what you wanna do
You made a nigga change his ways
Bragging to my mama,now all she know is you
Girl you brighten up my day
I don't want no one but you

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?
