[Intro]
I'm on (I'm on)
I'm on (I'm on)
I'm on (I'm on, I'm on)
I'm on (Ohh yeah)
I'm on (Ay)
I'm on

[Verse 1]
I'm on like I've never been off
I'm going in like I never been out
My cousin in the pen never been out
I'm 'bout to make it and buy lil Jr. a penthouse
At 14 saw things that you've never seen
Little nigga doing things that you never dreamed
Ok I'm on like Tray and Loopay
Young nigga say I'm fresh like toothpaste
Kicking it in the Dale cooling in Parkway
My money where my mouth is, let it parlay
I swear you can get money in a lot of ways
You ain't gotta sell drugs to get them pockets straight
I'm on a positive vibe
I had a long day
Keeping my money right, right by the wrong was
Niggas hollering money they ain't worth a penny though
No religion, my niggas worship the semi though
Niggas claim real, they wearing stilettos though
You know I'm married to the money I can't let it go
Wait till send my nigga Angelo home
Other day I was talking to my cousin Bone
He said do your thing, hear you snapping on this song
Told him I love you cuz
Hold your head stay strong
He told me keep it up conversation on the phone
That's what it is, light switch cut a nigga on
I can't lie my niggas going hard with the stones
Niggas hating they thought I was with the Kolyon
No I ain't with the Kolyon, you know I ain't
I fuck with them boys though, you know I get dirty with them (I get dirty with them)

[Verse 2]
My little niggas in Pompano, we get snapping on
I can't play with this money, I can't be lacking though
Even when I don't want to [?] I can't be lacking though
You know little J Black he be stacking though
I was with my nigga Herb in the Audi
So I leave a nigga stretched, Ali Barbi
Money building up like Bob, not Marley
I'm on so I gotta have my cake like a party
You be on some [?] shit, in love with her body
She gon' fuck the whole crew, you gon' say I'm lying
She gon' suck the dick while my lil' nigga behind it
In the club had them hoes whooping like a siren
Get up in the game, fuck it up like a virus
Swear you Tyler Perry, your girl calling me Byron
My pockets fat, 'bout to put it on a diet
Ohh My pockets fat, 'bout to put it on a diet
I'm on like the song
Hope they call my phone
Because before when I was old
Lil' J Black you ain't know
My niggas they on the cut
They tryna' get it up
I get it live like a slut
Tony Hawk, I'ma stunt
I fuck with [?]
He wanna see me win
When I make it he gon' have them chickens bumping like a pen
Shout out to everybody who fuck with lil' Black
And I fuck with everybody 'cause they fuck with me back
In the hood I can't sleep
Shit I gotta eat
Get on the beat
Don't let it breathe
My wrist game mean
My neck on bling
My roster full straight shooters on my team
Had to reup 'cause there was losers on my team
My lil' niggas got pieces like wings
My dog Joey, he be on the beans
My dog Wesley he go crazy for the weed
Yeah he a fiend, still fuck with em' though
And I fuck with [?] 'cause he fuck with me mo'
And I ain't brazy 'bout this money, she in love with me mo'
She been straight, good to me
I can't call her a hoe
I'm going ham, got the bread on top
Yo' ass dead I'm 'bout to ehad on top
My niggas on the stroll, a hundred for the guap
So how you gon' expect to come around with it and not get popped

[Outro]
I'm on
I'm on
Lil Dolph, for real though
I gotta maintain
I'm from the Nola where the grass don't grow
I'm from the Nola
I'm on
I'm on
And I'm gone
