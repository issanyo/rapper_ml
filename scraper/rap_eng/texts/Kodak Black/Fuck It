[Intro]
Nah dawg, this lil beat sound familiar like I heard this song before
Somebody did this shit or something before, I don't know

[Hook]
I swear I think I heard this beat before
But fuck it, I'mma rip this bih anyway
Everybody tell me she a thot ho
But fuck it, I'mma hit that bih anyway
He coppin' deuces, he don't want the beef no more
But fuck it, we done tied him up anyway
I'm gon' take this money to my grave
I ain't leavin' nothing when I leave

[Verse 1]
Fuck it, I be rolling on a bean
Yeah, fuck it, it ain't nothing if you leave
Yeah, fuck it, you ain't nothing but a fiend
When I'm coming, know I'm running with them Z's
Fuck a rat, nigga, I'm getting to the cheese
I be running to that money full speed
I shouldn't have brought her over, she don't wanna leave
Said "Bae, your Uber out the door, it's time to leave"
Yeah, fuck it, I ain't even bring the ski
Yeah, fuck it, you can't keep me out the skreets
Ho, you gon' die if you keep pissing on my sheets
Ain't wanna drive so I just ordered UberEATS

[Hook]
I swear I think I heard this beat before
But fuck it, I'mma rip this bih anyway
Everybody tell me she a thot ho
But fuck it, I'mma hit the bitch anyway
He coppin' deuces, he don't want the beef no more
But fuck it, we done tied him up anyway
I'm gon' take this money to my grave
I ain't leavin' nothing when I leave

[Verse 2]
Yeah, fuck it, I don't do no meet-and-greet
Yeah, fuck it, ain't no linking up with me
Yeah, fuck it, it's just me and Shotgun Pete
Pistol Pete, a nigga knew him since I was 3
My chains stupid wet, my diamonds cause a leak
I put Christian Louboutins on your feet
All this money doing something to my brain
Fuck it, I don't even wanna hang
I done elevated, yeah, overhead
Yeah, I'm a lil sedated cause I'm on my meds
Yeah, fuck it, put my phone on Do Not Disturb
Yeah, fuck it lil bitch, you getting on my nerves

[Hook]
I swear I think I heard this beat before
But fuck it, I'mma rip this bih anyway
Everybody tell me she a thot ho
But fuck it, I'mma hit the bitch anyway
He coppin' deuces, he don't want the beef no more
But fuck it, we done tied him up anyway
I'm gon' take this money to my grave
I ain't leavin' nothing when I leave
