[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
All attention on me (on me)
Is anybody with me, say preach? (oh who hear me?)
Louie V linen to the T (oh I'm clean)
Baby I ain't Christian, I'm street (from the street)
Go, go, jump out cha' seat (everybody)
Stepping through, Guiness on my feet (anybody)
Its coming, I can feel it in me (almighty)
Maybe its the spirit in me (somebody)
I'm spittin', I be gettin' really deep (in my body)
Sinning please, Lord forgive me (forgive me, look)
I wonder, could you even hear me? (could you hear me? Look)
I ain't been gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
My family depending on me (on me)
Addicted to the benjis, I be geeked (I be geekin')
Lately, I been stealing all week (I'm schemin')
Hungry, so I'm stealing just to eat (so I'm schemin')
Even though I steal, I ain't a thief (but I'm schemin')
Shawty keep feeling on me (oh I)
She love me like she worshiping me (It's alright)
She ain't praying, but she on her knees (all mighty)
I'm about to bless her like she sneezed (all mighty)
Together, we Adam and Eve (and Eve)
If I'm blind, help a nigga see (me see)
Cuban link, fitted on me (on me)
Chandelier glistening, on me (on me)
And I pay my tithe, each week (my dues)
Damn I'm really feeling the peace (oh I do)
Maybe it's the jigga in me (jiggaboo)
I put my fucking pistol in me (.32)

[Outro]
Oh I'm jiggin
Ooh ooh
Maybe its the jigga
Aye, amazing grace
Come on now
Come on now
Come on now
I never would've made it
Without you
Without you
