[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, if you don't mind
I wanna have a...I wanna have a word witcha
Look, come here, I needa talk to you, look
You must think, I'm just that nigga to be walkin' 'round in sundresses in here like you won't get your ass snatched up
Zaytoven
You know who the fuck I am nigga? You know what this is
Mustard on that beat, hoe
Haha, you know I'm fuckin' playin' with me man
Better do somethin' slutty, know what I mean?
You keep on playin', know what I mean?
You got two options

[Chorus: T.I.]
Shawty show me what it in for, okay
Don't be hesitatin', you know I ain't gon' play
Shawty show me what it in for, no doubt
Drop your boy a pin pullin' up at your house
Shawty show me what it in for (ayy, that's right, ay, ay, ay)
Shawty show me what it here for (yaaa)

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm eatin', I'll leave you a T.I.P
I'm speedin', no license, I got I.D
Might fuck around and hop out with Zonnique
They be tellin' you 'bout me and how I be
I'm kickin' pigeons, baby no more lilly-dilly
I'm gettin' Benjis, no more eatin' Piggly Wigglys
Girl I'll jump in your pussy with my feelings in it
That's the only place I go ain't got my pistol wit' me
Show me what you in for, show me what's the dealie
We gon' ride around my city, yeah and poppin' wheelies
I keep it real-y, yeah you pretty, well I keep it jiggy
Wonder how your people feel about you gettin' with me

[Chorus: T.I.]
Shawty show me what it in for, okay
Don't be hesitatin', you know I ain't gon' play
Shawty show me what it in for, no doubt
Drop your boy a pin, pullin' up at your house
Shawty show me what it in for (ayy, that's right, ay, ay, ay)
Shawty show me what it here for (yaaa)
Shawty show me what it here for

[Verse 2: T.I. & Offset]
Okay, fresh out with no wind blowin'
Pullin' up and rollin' down the window
Shawty show what it here for (show it)
Smokin' with your friends and your kinfolk
Whoop they ass in spades, okay then
Shawty show what it here for (show it)
You been runnin' from me for a long time
Been runnin' from me for a long time (show it, show it)
Shawty show what it here for
Too hood to be good for you, still too good to be true (true)
Got two million in commercial properties, few million in jewels (ayy)
Kickin' shit, nigga talkin', I'm livin' shit (yeah)
Half this shit these rappers rappin' 'bout, I already did this shit (forreal)
Travel the world, successfully open the legs and businesses
Don't know 'bout it, you don't pay attention (show it, show it)

[Chorus: T.I.]
Shawty show me what it in for, okay
Don't be hesitatin', you know I ain't gon' play
Shawty show me what it in for, no doubt
Drop your boy a pin, pullin' up at your house
Shawty show me what it in for (ayy, that's right, ay, ay, ay)
Shawty show me what it here for (yaaa)
Shawty show me what it here for
