[Intro]
Yah, Glee
Aye, bitch, I done growed up

[Hook]
Project baby all grown up, I'm a rugrat
Still can't hit the club and get drunk, bih
Still can't hit the club, can't get no run, bih
Fuck that shit, I'm goin' anyway
Project baby all grown up, I'm a rugrat
Still can't hit the club, and get drunk, but I'm like fuck that
Woke up and I dropped me a deluxe, I'm like plus tax
Teacher tried to put me in timeout, I said, "fuck class"

[Verse]
You ain't my mama, ho, I ain't gettin' in nun no corner, I said "fuck class"
Told me say no drugs, nope, you know I upped that
You already know I'm jello, graduated finnessin' got me a lunch rack
I'm like what's that
Finesse you out your lunch sack
Forgot my bookbag at the crib, but I ain't forget about the dutch pack
Geeked up like a nerd, nigga, test me, you get fucked back
Got them books on me, and just this page I'm readin' right now a hundred racks
Doctor ion take my meds no more right now, it cost me double stacks
Jaguar orange [?], jansport in the locker
I just seen my old teacher, she still waitin' on her retirement check
Lil homie SAT back, then I had a MAC-10
Said I'm on my way, make sure your babies with there daddy
I ain't no babysitter, but I be kidnappin'
That Glock will shock a nigga, what's that Glock static
Angelica, she suck my testicles, bih so fantastic
I don't fuck with Susie, because I don't want no black ho
Reptar, I go dinosaur
I'm a sniper
Pull up like a diaper
Ion do no back and forth
The teacher said, "it's naptime", but I am tired of sleepin' on the floor
Dumpin' at them, bagged the nigga, but ion do no fuckin' chores
Let me find out you still at summer camp
I done graduated, now I got a MAC-11
Aye, lemme find out you still at daycare
Put that wooly on that little boy and he shitted on himself
And I'm from the projects
And I keep that permit, don't I keep that permit
I'm a rugrat, little nigga, yeah, don't I keep that Tommy
Don't I keep that Tommy, I said don't I keep that Tommy
And I'm braided up like Chuckie
And I'm gettin' money
Rollin', I be dufflin'
Youngin', he be thuggin, yeah

[Outro]
All grown up, I'm a rugrat
Still can't hit the club, and get drunk, but I'm like fuck that
Teacher tried to put me in timeout, so I said, "fuck class"
Fuck class, ion need class
Booted up when I see class
