Broward County Florida nigga
Everything 1k, young nigga man
Project baby Haitain boy (that lil' nigga from Pompano)

I be that young Haitian boy out the project
Jitterboy kept my b shooter right in my pocket
Shit real, I used to get a thrill when I'm robbin'
Now I need a mill' to put my OG in a Bugatti
That my shawty, man she done been through a lot
Even when she smile, know she really missin' my puff
Told me keep my hands off the stove it's real hot
But my nigga said it's okay for me so I touched the pot
I'm in a soul/sole vibe, head first and I'm 'bout mines
I just met me a powerhouse, about time
Lil' mama ride or die, she be on my mind
Baby girl wine fine, she say she all mine

That lil' nigga from Pompano
It's lil Kodak, boy you already know
I'm that lil' nigga from Pompano
Project Baby boy don't act like you dont know

I'm in the loud dawg, tearin' the beat up
If not, I'm in the Jaguar tearin' the street up
I swear that, word that, ear that
Say that boy whenever be shit, I heard that (I heard that)

Pretty young thing, she be doin' her thing
She jump on a nigga dick, and have me goin' insane
Ever since I gotta hit it, that I ain't been the same
I ain't been trickin' off of nothin', I ain't been runnin' no gang
Shawty got me fucked up 'bout it, make your boy wanna sing
That money be on my mind, but she run all through my brain
I'm from Broward County, I'm young and I'm ? (young and ?)
I hold my own shit, young nigga silent

Project Baby, I'm outchea
They took us out the ghetto, but I'm still out here
I was brought here, I crawl here, I walk here
So can't no motherfucker make me different 'round here (No)
Oooh child, things gon' get easy
It's gon' get brighter lil' nigga, and I can see it
I'm just out here, chasin' my dream
You niggas sleepin', money fiendin'
That lil' boy runnin' around thievin', no daddy
My folks say I come from that demon semen, he sixteen mouth full of purp, yeah he gleamin'
? Wrist mean, on dem pills geekin', codeine with the sprite
He up all night gleamin'
