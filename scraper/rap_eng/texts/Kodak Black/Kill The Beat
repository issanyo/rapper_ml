[Intro]
Pow pow pow
Paper chasing Haitian
Project baby
1800 block
Ugly corner nigga
Y'all won't feel me anyways
I ain't even gotta talk

[Verse 1]
Came up
I was down
Got it off the ground
They was up
I was low, got it off the floor
Paper chase
Road running, you ain't on the route
Turned up
Like my music, I be smoking loud
Black nigga on that white bitch
Milk her like a cow
Cashed out
They ain't like me but they love me now
Pull up to the floor
You ain't even know
Been cold, fire
Different jags in a row
Pay me back before
Diss me like a hoe
My nigga pay me for a show and I don't even show
I slid by
I ain't flex I just brung it through
Swear to God
If you flex imma punish you
25% on the tent, on a rental coupe
Yeah I'm from the Noya
Off that Ugly Corner Avenue
Ain't gotta tell my shooter, he gon' shoot
Kodak got them snipers on a roof
Whipping with the magic stick then I poof
Project baby
Would you like to (?) swimming pool
Been ready
You ain't ready, nigga getting ready
Time is money
Better have that money, I want every second
You niggas sweet niggas, diabetic
Living legends, jit will snatch your necklace
I'm at the studio fuck a class session
Sorry momma, I will never learn my lesson
I need a calculator just to count my blessings
Finessing, flexing
Flyer than a jetson
Young and reckless
Hit you and your main man and I won't regret it
Switched up
I got a different wardrobe
Designer
Custom Louis V torso
Pop my collar nigga wipe me down
Got it from the bottom now I fly around
Bitch I'm out here, had to get it in
Tell her go first, I'm a gentleman
Go so loud she be listening
Ain't no time to fuck these hoes, I'm a minute man
I'm a project baby I can't go commercial
Cuz I just hit the plug he stay on commercial
Square, not my round
You not my circle
Money got me walking like I'm Steve Urkel
Jump right through your window like a Ninja Turtle
They want my autograph but I can't write in cursive
They hollerin' murder

[Outro]
I kill the beat
I kill the beat
Lil Kodak, he gon' kill the beat
I kill the beat
Rest in peace
