[Hook]
Jumped in my coupe and I can't even steer
(I hit the gas)
Got Ferragamo hanging off my rear
(Hanging off my ass)
You know my dope so loud you can't even hear
(You can't even hear)
Extended clip hanging round off my hip
(You get hit)
It's lil Kodak and you know that I am here
(You know that I'm that kid)
I'm on these pills and I cannot sit still
(Man I can't sit)
I'm splurgin' switchin' gears
(You know I'm burning now)
Can't love no hoe, no I'm not Jack and Jill
(No I can't love a thot)

[Verse 1]
I'm flipping pages, stacking paper like the chef
Fuck you niggas, I been thugging by myself
.40 cal hanging off my Fendi belt
And when I grow up I just wanna be a chef
I got my money right now all these bitches left
My money dirty, hit the club and make a mess
And how I'm running with the tech they call a ref
Man I threw my dog a bone, I told him fetch
My dope is loud
I can't hear you, what you say? (Boy speak up)
Paper chase, take a break I wanna race
Andale, dope all up in my momma place
I'm in the trap like Spider-man to save the day

[Verse 2]
Project baby
Goodness gracious, Uncle Sam (That's so funny)
Bought me some Gucci Penny loafers
I don't even wear them (With some money
Bought me an Audi, got no license
I still drive it (I be speedin')
Peek-a-boo, I lost my roof
Help me find it! (Because I need it)
Ferragoma, I rock Prada
I wear Robin (Rock designer)
I'm on lean, I don't sleep
I'm on molly (I'm a sniper)
Why you flexing? Boy you stressing
Nigga stop it (You need to quit)
This so foreign, I can't work it
Help me park it (I don't get it)
Pour a four out the seal
Moving slow (Just like the Matrix)
Remember we can't pay the bills
We was broke (Now we can pay them)
Now I'm that guy, I'm so high
You so low (Boy you low)
I be swimming in that money
Boy you broke (Catch my blow)
