[Intro]
Remember hitting licks in a Mercedes Benz
And I just got my mom a Mercedes Benz
Helluva
Helluva one
Helluva

[Hook]
Helluva, he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back 'cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me 'cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
Yeah, Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back 'cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me 'cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are

[Verse 1]
Yeah I just got my mom a new Mercedes Benz
Said I don't like that fake shit, I'm a hater then
I roll up and I face it up
She can't keep no job with her lil' lazy self
She can't get no job with her lil' lazy self
I be so damn turnt up with my crazy self
I get so much money with my ugly ass
Nigga run up on me, I'ma bust his ass
I might self destruct because I love to spaz
You'll think I'm walking death because I stay in my bag
I'm fresh to death, I'll put a nigga in the bag
I break my momma heart and put it in the cast
I'm bleeding when I'm stepping I might need a nurse
I hop out kill the scene and put it in the dirt
Kodak Black, I never hesitate to yellow tape
I hop out kill the scene and put it on a shirt

[Hook]
Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
Yeah helluva, He always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are

[Verse 2]
Page 57 that's a special look
I hope I go to heaven cause I'm not the devil lil' son
I pull up crack your melon and I roll up a blunt
I'm getting this cheese I call it sandwich stack it on a croissant
All these niggas just be capping, just be smacking niggas
I will really clap them like a round of applause
Doing fraud is my advantage I be stackin' them funds
Rapping is my habit I be rapping for fun
You'll think I'm from Milwaukee I hit the SunTrust got a lot of bucks
She think I'm acting cocky I can't love you I cannot just lust
I just lust, I don't get too passionate
Play too many games I wanna whack a bitch

[Hook]
Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
Yeah, Helluva he always keep a helluva one
I can't love you back cause that's a helluva love
Never cheat on me cause I ain't regular
I'm wondering if they real the way they say they are
