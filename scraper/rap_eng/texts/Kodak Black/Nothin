[Intro: Kodak]
Get you some money
I ran up on a silly nigga, what you say
He said "I ain't say nothing"

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You niggas be moving yall lips but yall ain't saying nothing
Lil nigga get off my dick and go get you some money
Lil nigga get out my ear cause I ain't trynna hear nothing
Shawty get out my crib right now if you ain't fucking

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Bitch what the fuck you mean
You can pack your shit and leave
Matter of fact don't play with me
I need to fuck before you leave
Nigga I'm out your league
Lil nigga that's not your cheese
Full tank but I'm on E
I'm 1k but I be on E
Bitch I got so much heat
I can drop a tape next week
They say I got symphony
But I ain't got sympathy
Lil shawty want to strip for me
Lil shawty said she live for me
Niggas out here physically
But locked up mentally

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You niggas be moving yall lips but yall ain't saying nothing
Lil nigga get off my dick and go get you some money
Lil nigga get out my ear cause I ain't trynna hear nothing
Shawty get out my crib right now if you ain't fucking

[Verse 2: Plies]
I had to pick her bag like the trashman
Bitch I run a scam off finessing
Dope stepped on, I'm compressing
Ran off on the plug, bitch I'm Wesson
Tell the bit quit, I'm your blessing
I done killed the pussy, now she testing
Pussy too good to rob her, I be checking
Bitch I got the bag, I ain't stressing
Stopped showing love, learned my lesson
Told them cracker do your job and confessing
Had to got some head bitch on South Beach
Know a couple pussy nigga who ain't like me

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You niggas be moving yall lips but yall ain't saying nothing
Lil nigga get off my dick and go get you some money
Lil nigga get out my ear cause I ain't trynna hear nothing
Shawty get out my crib right now if you ain't fucking
