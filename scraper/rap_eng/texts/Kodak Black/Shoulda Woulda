[Intro]
I should've did
I could've
I would've
Kodak nigga

[Hook]
Could've got the Beamer, I ain't really want it
Would've hit your girl, I wasn't really horny
Should've turned down, now I really on it
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Would've shot the nigga, that what Cuda did
Could've went platinum, that what Luda did
Should've could've did, could've would've did

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I should've did em in
Blood on my brother, I wouldn't have a friend
Ridin' in a spear diamonds, chandelier
I can't let you niggas near, bruh I wouldn't dare
If love lived here I still couldn't care
Imma get that Audi truck, pull up anywhere
Couldn't see ya, had my Ray Bans on
I would never see ya, wouldn't wanna be ya
YSL cheetahs, these are not Adidas
Oh you wanna drop a track? Charge 'em for a feature
Ridin' with my (?) , wouldn't fuck with Keisha
Yellow submarine, I feel like the Beatles

[Hook]
Could've got the Beamer, I ain't really want it
Would've hit your girl, I wasn't really horny
Should've turned down, now I really on it
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Would've shot the nigga, that what Cuda did
Could've went platinum, that what Luda did
Should've could've did, could've would've did

[Verse 2]
Man, I should've got the Lex
Dropped the top on 'em, I ain't wanna flex
Would've hit your girl, I ain't want the sex
I had shit to do, I made her drop the neck
Couldn't do it
I shouldn't do it
Would've picked your call up but I was gettin' to it
Ridin' like the rodeo
Never lie, money longer than Pinocchio
I said, nobody knows
You an undercover booger and nobody knows, faggot
My bankroll like me, never folds
I got my new bitch ridin' and she never rode

[Hook]
Could've got the Beamer, I ain't really want it
Would've hit your girl, I wasn't really horny
Should've turned down, now I really on it
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Should've, could've did, would've could've did
Would've shot the nigga, that what Cuda did
Could've went platinum, that what Luda did
Should've could've did, could've would've did
