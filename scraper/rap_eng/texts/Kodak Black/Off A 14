[Intro]
On my lonely, scoping, poking
Crackers had to rope me

[Verse 1]
First i started off, with a 14
Then i worked my way up to a whole thing
I remember i was just 14
Soaked the game up, from sitting around the OG's
Ten toes down, i'm on my own feet
I ain't fucking with ya, if you owe me
I can't love a hoe, i love my OG
Cause love will get you killed, that's what she told me
I don't gang bang, but i'm a banger
But when i twist my fingers, i throw K's up
You ain't talkin' money, gotta hang up
Serving all my junkies, off my pager

[Verse 2]

Damn, i was in a jag, now i pull up in a Lamb
Abracadabra, that work go kazam
Fuck your baby-mama, kick her out, i call a pam
Finessing's all i know, i be quick to pull a scam
Jumpin' out your house, you can call me Rob Van Dam
All these molly's bagged up, look like M&M's
E-murder on the same shit, i'm on like synonyms
I need my bread first, i don't worry 'bout the ham
So why i hate to see them flockas taking over bam
Free my brother cool, i can't wait  till I can see him
I started off finessing and i went hard
I told my mama imma' be a damn star
In this rap shit everybody flawed
I want all my money, save the damn talk
Dont make me start back, the way i left off
I found me a connect ain't talking X-Box
Then i copped a 4 in a baby
Slim white girl- i call her shady
Stick and move, you know i'm on probation
My P.O. be with the woo, but she dont face me
Youngest out the projects, i'm the baby
Mama brought me here, my mama flew from Haiti
Damn i had to let the streets raise me
I ain't have no other choice, the streets made me
I be sippin lean it keep me lazy
Like a flower- that codeine had me daisy
24 grams call me Bailey
I just want to thank the lord, 'cause he saved me
I was caved in on my lonely
Like a sad dog i had to roam free
Stop that dick ridin', you dont now me
Young nigga i be balling like Ginobili
