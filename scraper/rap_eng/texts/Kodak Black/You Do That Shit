[Intro]
Nigga, you do that shit, ayy
Rollin' that piff, ayy
Put that tool on that chick, ayy
Ya ya ya

[Chorus]
State tried to give me eight, I told em you do that shit
Remember kickin' doors, I knocked the screws off that bih
Lil' shawty fucked up bout me, I put that woo on that bih
Ain’t sleepin' on that money, I won’t snooze on it
Aye, all you niggas pussy, I put some lube on it
When my top drop, they mouth drop like, “Who own it?”
They like, “Who in it?”
They like, “Who he is?”
Heard that nigga wanted beef, I told him you eat it

[Verse]
You can't book me at no club, nah, I just do arenas
Sniper gang in the buildin', my whole crew geekin'
Jumped up in the rap shit, gave it a new meanin'
I found out ‘bout my son and he gave me a new reason
I’m hotter than a sauna, but I swear my jewels freezin’
And my shoes bleeding, ya
I might move to Venus, ya
Ball like Gilbert Arenas, ya
Lul' shawty want my semen, ya
Shawty want my species, ya
Can't even have my feces, ya
Homie want a feature
I might fuck my teacher, ya
And I love my PO, aye
Getting chip like Frito Lay
Can't be killing people, aye
I got on Gucci sneakers
No, I can't be killin' bitches
Gettin' blood on my Givenchy's

[Chorus]
State tried to give me eight, I told em you do that shit
Remember kickin' doors, I knocked the screws off that bih
Lil' shawty fucked up bout me, I put that woo on that bih
Ain’t sleepin' on that money, I won’t snooze on it
Aye, all you niggas pussy, I put some lube on it
When my top drop, they mouth drop like, “Who own it?”
They like, “Who in it?”
They like, “Who he is?”
Heard that nigga wanted beef, I told him you eat it

[Outro]
Aye, like real shit man a nigga…
I can’t be shootin' niggas, gettin' blood on my Giuseppe’s and shit
Nigga you do that shit, aye (Sniper Gang)
Woo on that bih, aye
Put that tool on that jit, aye
Ya, ya, ya
