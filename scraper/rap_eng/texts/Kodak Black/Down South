[Verse 1]
I know you from the Bronx
Heard it's cold, it's like my heart
Let me book ya a first class flight to Florida where it's hot
I'ma take ya down south, show you what I'm rappin' 'bout
Young niggas, 14, permanent golds in they mouth
I be jumpin' on these beats, remember sleepin' on the couch
Every nigga in these streets know about me, they can vouch
I'm still wearin' Ree's like I'm still out here sellin' rock
Like my Ree's, you gon' let me tie ya down or you not?
When you wanna vacay? MIA is the spot
Where you hop on jet skis, niggas ridin' on yachts
Four wheelers, cuban links, niggas hoppin' out the drop
Show ya 'round the Noya, Ugly Corner, 1800 Block

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?

[Verse 2]
'Cause girl you got me singin'
I feel like I'm figulatin'
I might switch my occupation and just open up a bakery
'Cause every night, we cakin'
Girl you sweeter than Miss Allie
I might eat ya like a pastry, and keep ya like my .380
Say I been trippin' lately
I been in my feelings lately
I ain't even been jiggin', while they stickin', we conversatin'
I ain't been trickin' with these bitches even though you ain't my lady
We ain't seal the deal but I'ma keep it real and be patient
I'm runnin' with them Z's, remember dancin' with the devil
You 26, but I'm 2613 forever
Young rebel but I'm clever
I don't get too sentimental
Now I got you where I want you
I know the spot like a freckle
I know what it is now
I know how I feel now
I wanna build now, me with you
Call me on the FaceTime
Heard it through the grapevine, that I wanna plant my seed with you
You gon' make me change my ways
Postin' on my page, WCW
I want you to be my main
I don't want no one but you

[Hook]
Girl you motivate me, I been wonderin' lately
And I was thinking, you and me
I be smilin' baby when you call me baby
You know how to drink me, make me weak
Baby girl you special
I'ma try my best to, give you enough effort in the week
Am I bein' extra?
Am I oversteppin' my boundaries?
