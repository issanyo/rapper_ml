[Intro: Kodak Black]
DJ Swift on the track
My mama always told me 'bout that water, boy
Dubba-AA flexin'
She said, "Boy that water deep, boy don't get in that water"
I still got in that water
This is the sound

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me 'bout that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Like a kickstand I'm in here leaning
Them crackers let me out, swear it feel like I'm dreaming
Michael Jackson, yeah, that case I beat it
Fuck them hard slabs, now I sleep on Tempur-Pedic
I'm going hard 'cause my family need me
Mama said if I believe it, I can achieve it
Can't trust these niggas, they misleading
Can't trust these hoes, they so deceiving
I let him eat then he got greedy
I need a lifeguard, I'm in the deep end
I told that bitch I'm never leaving
I'm outta here, I'm going to Venus
My mama always told me, I ain't listen
So now I'm dealing with the consequences
I dive right in that water, went to swimming
Gotta watch out for these niggas, they be fishing

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, Why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
Down on my ass, I had to get my feet in
They had told me change my ways but I ain't wanna listen
I looked my son in his eyes, I can't fail my mission
I say my prayers and tote my thang, I know they wanna kill me
Wake up in the morning, ain't got none' to eat
I had to man up to get on my feet
I go to Bay just to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't pay a thing
Since I was young I've been slanging that heat
It be some massacres right on my street
It be some massacres right on my street
Remember they ain't gave me shit when I ain't had nothing
They want my spot but fuck them niggas, I'm focused on money
On everything, she say she love me I know she don't love me
3Three ain't round for to watch me, think I'm feeling something
My momma told me stack my M's, told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot, and he told on me
My uncle told me they ain't right, all them niggas phony
Can't lose it all for somebody who don't care about you

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, "Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in"
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, Why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's
