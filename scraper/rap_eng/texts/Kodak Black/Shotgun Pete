[Hook: Petho Burr]
Shotgun Pete
Hop out with your niece
Unexpected, you can count on me
I'm smoking African
I'm gettin' them racks man
Do not get bagged lil' nigga
Ain't talkin' trash can
Petho Burr
And I be on the curb
Ain't sellin' work
I be sellin' words
I'm on the verse now
I'm goin' berserk now
I ain't got no merch now
I'm sellin' shirts now

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Lil' Petho he on things, he just be in the cut
My nigga Pistol Pete, he always keep a toolie tuck
Yea, when I'm on the stage, my niggas be in the back
Every time I'm on the stage, my niggas in here scrap
I might get violated, lately I been smoking thrax
I ain't here what you sayin', so much bass I'm blowin' loud pack
Don't get wacked cause we trynna turn away from sinnin'
But I'll bag a nigga and fill up my recycle bin
Got black cars now
Ain't doin' no fraud now
Lil' Draco too wild
He need to calm down
He in the Range and he slidin' layin' on a body
It's rainin' but he out here plottin' trynna catch a body
When I popped a nigga top, I popped two mollies
I called my momma that night, I ain't know what to do 'bout it
I told my niggas move in silence cause they too rowdy
My nigga Petho, he so G-code I be praying 'bout him
All my life, I grew up wildin' all I know is violence
They told me I ain't need my pistol while I'm in the projects
But niggas got animosity I keep the P-90
I'm so G 'bout it, slidin' in a G-Body
