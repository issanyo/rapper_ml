[Intro]
This shit crazy, dog
My young bull was just with me last night
I shifted, dog, he got caught up
And the vehicle he was in had all my raps that I wrote when I was locked up a couple bids, you know?
1800 nights

[Verse 1]
I was just thinkin' 'bout family
Thinkin' 'bout Pop Hendley them
Don't say you love me if you don't mean that shit
And I'm thuggin' hard 'cause I mean that shit
I was just thinkin' 'bout my family
They been feelin' like I abandoned them
Why the fuck am I walking around here with a Glock for?
Nigga livin' dirty so I gotta keep the mop on me
Got a street sweeper, but I still keep the mop though
I put everything I got on
I ain't seen my brother in a week
I put too much time in the streets
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma don't worry 'bout me
All you gotta do is love King
I hope y'all see what I be thinkin' 'bout
I'm smilin'
I just smile just to cope now
But I'm wildin'
I swear to God I'm tryin'
I'm tryna slow down
My people tellin' me to slow down
I fell in love with the fourth pound
You would think I'm with the Zoe Pound
Shoutout to ATL
But where I'm from we won't say "12"
We say "Tro-down"
The raiders out there just rolled around
All my niggas gettin' rico
All my niggas gettin' rico
He ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
Promise he ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
He ain't gon' tell ya if he know
If you 'round me
I promise if you 'round me, he's Zoe
He a zombie, he Zoe
A zombie on earth, I'ma Zoe
I brought hell on earth for these hoes
You my heaven on earth, you my hoe, baby
You my old lady
All them hoes hatin'
Well fuck what them hoes say
We rockin' Gucci with Dolce
Love my ol' girl, love my old lady
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't pop molly
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm sayin'
My chauffeur don't like speedin'
I like the Tesla better when it drive me
I can sit back on IG
I ain't gotta look up when the light green
I'm on the i- on autopilot, my bitch ridin' me
Cruise control
I thank the lord I ain't lose my soul
1800 nights I done sacrificed
Triple cross like Jesus Christ

[Verse 2]
You ain't understand me I'ma tell you twice
I'm ugly corner, even when I die
I'm wonderin' if you love me like I
I'm wonderin' if you thuggin' like how I be
Head first, is he runnin' right behind me?
Nah, fuck that, you better be runnin' right beside me
It's like everything that I touch, it just be fallin' apart
I can't leave my past behind me
I wanna know what's goin' on in the projects
I wanna slide and go see what it look like
Remember Pop hit a lick on a four wheeler
E Murder, almost lost his life on a dirt bike
I seen a cracker to my left so I turned right
I lost my re-up money tryna shoot dice
My niggas leavin' niggas stank for some hood rank
You ain't got no street cred, ain't got no Woo stripes
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas and my family
They the only ones that understand me
Pop the clutch, fishtail on the banshee
The Devil sent me a blessing
My dreads like devil horns, they don't know that I be on my damn knees
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord that I fell for it
Forgive me lord that I fell short
I'm dressin' plain in the airport
Bust a nigga brain if you care for it
Young nigga what would you do for it
Her boyfriend smokin' Newports
Just put my baby momma in a new foreign
'Bout to write a book, no Dr. Seuss, boy
I got stories like a news reporter
Like a book, put my momma in two stories
I'm postin' in the hood 'cause the school borin'
I'm smokin' Cherry Pie, I don't smoke Spice
I would never tell you about my old life
Sniper biker
Pop a wheelie on the Raptor
I got snakes in my closet, I'm a rattler
And I keep body bags for a rapper
Hidin' from my past, got me runnin' from a cracker
Lil' Kodak they just wanna see you captured
I'm snappin' and I'm flashin' like a camera
You don't know the meaning behind it
You don't know the reason I'm like this
Sincerely me
I'm feelin' this beat
To all my niggas in prison, if you listenin' right now, I miss you
