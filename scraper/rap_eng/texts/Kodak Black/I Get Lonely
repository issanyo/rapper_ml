[Intro]
Sometimes, sometimes
I get lonely

[Chorus]
I get lonely sometimes
I get lonely
I get lonely sometimes, sometimes
I be goin' crazy
I been thinkin' a lot lately
I get lonely too, you be lonely too
I been going through things

[Verse]
Aye, both my wrists is dripping, but my watch is water proof, yeah
Trigger finger itching, when I see you I'ma shoot ya
I'm thuggin' countin' money in the mean time
Time is money and I don't got no free time
You can never say I never loved you
You can never say I never loved you
I'm thuggin' countin' money in the mean time
Time is money and I ain't got no free time
Different nigga I got seven figures now
I ain't gone shoot a nigga how I shoot a nigga down
Ain't shootin' in the air, tryna knock off your hair
Ain't shootin' in the air, tryna knock off your hair
Money gave me power and a ego
I'm rich but I be sticking to the G code
I know you fuck with me, so do it for me please though
If you fuck with me, then do it for me please though
Yeah, I'ma project baby, I'm from golden acres
Came from Section 8 but now I got a mansion with two acres
Aye, I just might get in and win, thinkin' 'bout pullin' them capers
I'm thinkin' 'bout hurting my niggas, thinkin' 'bout hurting my neighbors
But I don't be tryna be violent, life could be much greater
But they wanna see me in prison, wanna see me on them papers
I get lonely
Muhfucka, I get lonely
Ain't nothin' I can do to keep you loyal to me
But all I wanna do is keep it real
My brothers and my niggas with me still
That's why god bless me 'cause I keep it real
Got sent back to society now I'm riding with the steel
There be too much envy, too much negative energy in the air
And my bitch from Memphis like she basketball player
I ain't go to class, nigga I was posted on the real
I ain't never go to class but that don't mean that I'ma fail
She make me feel good, I ain't even know that I could feel
Got a nigga attention, I ain't even know that I could care
And I don't like to vent 'cause don't nobody even care
I don't like to vent 'cause don't nobody wanna to hear me out
I get lonely sometimes, sometimes
I get lonely
