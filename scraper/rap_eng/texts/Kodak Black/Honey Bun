She Sweeter Then A Honey Bun, Ima Call Her Honey Bun
I Been Looking For You, Baby Where You From
I Been Searching For You, Where You Been? Girl Where The Hell You Been
Don't Make Me Be Your Man, Cause Man I Catch Feelings It Be Slipping Right Up Out My Hands

[Verse 1]
Girl I Don't Want To Wife You, But If You Want Me To That's What I Might Do
I Been Looking For Anyone Just Like You, You My Type Boo Damn I Think I Like You ( I Do )
You From Another Universe, You Not From Planet Earth, Cause I Been Single and Mingling and Still Ain't Find Nobody Similar
Man, Where She At Cause I'm Missing Her, I Hit It But I Ain't Quitting Her
My Ex Hating On The Low She Trying To Get To Her, I Made A Wish For Her.. Is It Her? Cause I'm Sipping Syrup And My Vision Blurred

[Hook]
She Sweeter Then A Honey Bun, Ima Call Her Honey Bun
I Been Looking For You, Baby Where You From
I Been Searching For You, Where You Been? Girl Where The Hell You Been
Don't Make Me Be Your Man, Cause Man I Catch Feelings It Be Slipping Right Up Out My Hands

[Verse 2]
She Popping Like Some Bubble Gum, Call Her Winter Fresh
Im A Dead Man Walking I'm Fresh To Death
We Body To Body I Be All Down Her Neck, Running Up A Check She Call Me Haitian Fresh
I Fall Up The Steps, Call It Blues Clues Cause I Was Trying To Find You But I Didn't Have A Clue
Jaguar XF When I Ride Through, Searching Through My GPS So I Can Find You
Where The Hell You Been You A GODDESS, I'm A Project Baby I'm Just Being Honest
Flow Sick So Sick, Make You Vomit, I Can't Catch No Feelings Baby Ima Drop It
