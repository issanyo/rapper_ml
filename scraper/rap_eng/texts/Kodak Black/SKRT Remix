Aye you know how i‘m rockin‘ now
Y‘all already know we doin
[Verse 1 : BIGD]
Girl I'm done with you
Girl you ate all my food
So I kick you out
All you do is chase clout
[Chorus]
SKRT SKRT SKRT SKRT SKRT
Uh Uh Uh SKRT SKRT
Uh Uh Uh SKRT SKRT
Pull up with them new drangs
SKRT SKRT
[Verse 2: BIG D]
(aye) I woke up in my house
Make me a sandwich with some Dunkin Donuts
Then I look up in my fridge
Found out they don't have no more egg nog (aye)
[Verse 3: BIG D and lildee ]
Pull up at your house
Walk up in it shoot it out (gang gang)
Shoot you in your face
That's a car chase (Hey)
Pull up at your house
Walk up in it shoot it out
Eat you up like some McDonalds
That some fried (out)
