[Intro]
Oh this the real deal, like for real for real?
I thought lil shawty was the real deal and I guess not
But this the real deal? For real?

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate

[Verse 1]
Let it spray, Kodak let it spray
I ain’t got to tote no 5, keep it just in case
Them niggas ever get out of line, put them in they place
‘Cause I be staying out the way, them niggas in the way
It Lil Kodak, I don’t rap, bitch I illustrate
It like I be painting pictures but I picture paint
So why they call you Kodak Black? You sippin’ Easter pink
I be right there at your house, think it’s trick or treat
I be drawing when I speak, see it vividly
I keep a 30 clip but this a Glock 23
Think it's sweet then come and see, I’ma demonstrate
Drop two ounces of codeine in my Minute Maid

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate

[Verse 2]
You ain’t gotta like my music but you gon’ respect me
By the way when you approach me better come correctly
I be on that Little Caesar's shit, hot and ready
All the motherfucking bread, where the damn jelly?
I can’t understand these bitches, they so damn messy
I want to motivate them niggas but I got them jealous
Lil nigga I got big racks
I be flexing, wondering why I ain’t got no six pack
All this flexin’, I deserve to have a six pack
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat

[Hook]
Lil nigga I got big bank
I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate
