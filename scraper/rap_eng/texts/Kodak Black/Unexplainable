[Hook]
Everybody tellin' me I need to change
But then y'all gon' complain when a nigga change
Bossed up you sayin' lately he ain't been the same
Fuck it y'all just wanna hate me anyways
Fuck it yeah the money gettin' to my brain
Yeah, I think I'm all that with this big chain
I ain't got no time tryin' to explain
Yeah I love you bitch but I ain't finna say it

[Verse 1]
Everybody finna have their own impression
I've been through too much so I don't like expressing
Tell you one thing you gon' ask another question
If I tell you how I feel you gon' take advantage
Yeah I know you read the text but you ain't get the message
I speak in codes it ain't for you if you don't understand it
Think what you want to think you could keep guessing
Why should I even tweet when all you finna do is @ it?
If I tell you 'bout myself I'm finna go to stressin
Cause I might go to ventin' and I'ma start reflectin'
Took off from my past ridin' in the Bentley
Walkin' 'round like fuck you I'm gettin' fetty

[Hook]
Everybody tellin' me I need to change
But then y'all gon' complain when a nigga change
Bossed up you sayin' lately he ain't been the same
Fuck it y'all just wanna hate me anyways
Fuck it yeah the money gettin' to my brain
Yeah, I think I'm all that with this big chain
I ain't got no time tryin' to explain
Yeah I love you bitch but I ain't finna say it

[Verse 2]
I'm rich, but I'm ridin' through the project
I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm on house arrest
So, how you finna say "I forgot who raised me"
When I'm takin' chances knowin' this a violation
If you love me, you'd understand my situation
Cause you already know I'm on probation
Everybody tellin' me they miss the old me
But how the fuck I'm finna change and be the old me?
I'm still the same nigga I'm evolving though
I kept goin' back to jail like a revolving door
A nigga steady seeing more so I elevate
Say go back to the Kodak of the first mixtape

[Hook]
Everybody tellin' me I need to change
But then y'all gon' complain when a nigga change
Bossed up you sayin' lately he ain't been the same
Fuck it y'all just wanna hate me anyways
Fuck it yeah the money gettin' to my brain
Yeah, I think I'm all that with this big chain
I ain't got no time tryin' to explain
Yeah I love you bitch but I ain't finna say it
