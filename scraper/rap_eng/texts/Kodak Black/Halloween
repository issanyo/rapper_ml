[Intro]
I'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity
I ain't talking cereal, but
I got all the tricks
Silly bitch, and I'ma finesse kid
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' for you tricks but some rabbit food
I could be ya professor 'cause I'll school ya
I shoulda been born in April 'cause I fool ya

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 1]
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 2]
I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen, but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease
They be like yo Kodak I just seen you on the scene
They be like I ain't approach you though, cuz you was looking mean
Don't need no friends I gotta big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic
No I'm not satanic

[Outro]
I'm not satanic
Who said that?
Why you said that?
Who said that?
