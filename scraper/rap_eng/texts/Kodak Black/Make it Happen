Hook: I Been trappin' And I been snappin'
Pockets touchin' so I had to make it happen
(pockets touchin' so I had to make it happen)
My Momma rent due, my sister need shoes
And need decent clothes to go to school
So if I go to jail, just know
I do it for you.(if I go to jail just know I do it for you)

[Verse 1: 1wayfrank]
I been standin' on the block with my Soulja Reeboks
Crack rocks, high grade what you need I got
Serving to these fiends
Know its wrong but I'm grown
I had to leave them childish games alone
Boy its a struggle, that's why I hustle
Young nigga gotta chase them duffles
I'm gettin' cheese, my nigga ruffles
Boy get yo' racks up, can't be a poor hustler, rip lil creezy my fam boy I Love Ya
You watch over my shoulder when I'm standin on the corner
When the block hot, gettin' hotter then a sauna
Get rich scheme from May to the summer
Kidd Frank, 1waycamp, boy we comin' for ya'
I'm the keeper , off my brothers
I'm Sorry momma, that ya' son a young hustler
I can't be no Busta'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
For my nigga Cool, locked down doing time
That my round, I miss my nigga swea' to God
Imma Hold it down. If I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Shot gun, if you ridin' then I'm ridin'

I'ma Do it for you, Do it for me
Do it for we, do it for D Team
For Jay Green. Noya' boy doin' 3's 1K. Run the game, Gunplay
Momma say imma make it one day
People say imma make it someday
& this for Mel, Enell, and Finell
Panamera, got me bleedin' thru the Dale
Hittin licks, I be on the paper trail
Totin' pumps, smoking gas like a shell
Do it for us, do it for him, do it for them
Man this is for my shootas' posted under the rim
This for Keke, This For BeBe
Call me Stevie, they can't see me
Met a plug, now I'm on like the TV
Run up on me, burn em like a CD
Its Lil Kodak, They don't believe me
Half a Cash for gold junkiemoney feinin'

Lil nigga with some big dreams

Imma keep goin', and goin', and goin'

Time wait for no man, I Gotta get it nigga time wait for no man
Dreams of being rich, never told no one the story

Be the man of the house, bringing in consistent money
Never been spoiled I had to get it on my lonely
Never been a girl, but imma look out for my family

Cause I do it from the heart, Put my pain into rappin
I been trappin', Snappin'

I do it for my family
