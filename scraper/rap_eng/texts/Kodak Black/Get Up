[Intro]
Gotta get up, babe
I was on my ass, boy, I say, boy I gotta get up and make me some money boy, that's all I gotta give boy
For real, when you broke, you a joke

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Verse 1]
It's the project baby, I been out here since the jitter bug
Swiper no swipin', just been runnin' round stealin' stuff
Bitch, you ain't my daddy, fuck the teacher and the principal
A damn shame, I dropped outta school to be a criminal
I'm different from these niggas, ain't nothing like the typical
And nah, I ain't stuttin' that shit, It's just the principle
I ain't got no image, I ain't gotta keep no image up
But you can call me Kodak, she see it she wanna flick it up
I'm in the field, applying that D, I'm like the Seminoles
I'm in your girl, applying that D, I'm gettin' physical
Nigga think you fuckin' with me, I'm not feeling him
Any nigga run up on me, boy I'm sending 'em'

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm on my grown man, I'm just here for 4 bands
Park the stolo at my neighbor house, they called the tow man
I won't bend, ain't foldin', I won't back down from no man
Scopin' and pokin', they hit the cash for gold man
I was 14, when I met the cash for gold man
See me when you see me, lil buddy, stop the commotion
All that talk you doin' just givin' me free promotion
Nigga, if you ain't gon' use it, then why you totin' it
Remember I was on my dick, now I let my nuts hang
Trappin' off my Que Sera, it's the busta bus thing
Early in the mornin', she callin' me, tryna complain
I told her "ain't no love goin' on, it's just a fuck thing"

[Hook]
I was on my ass, said "fuck it, I gotta get up"
Remember I was down bad, funny how the kid up
Had to get my shit up, nigga run that shit up
Aye, pick it up, I'm out here tryna get it up, don't hit me up

[Outro]
For real bitch
Hell yeah
Wrist band
Haa
Get that shit up
Run that shit up
They didn't
