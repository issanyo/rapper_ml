[Intro]
Kodak (4x's), Project Baby
If it ain't no dollars then it ain't no deals (2x's)

[Hook]
Stick & move everyday
Tryna run it up all you niggas in the way
I can't stop doin' it
I'm finessin' I be outchea manuvering
Hit up then I'm shakin' it
Pay attention if you slippin' then I'm takin' it
I'ma keep doin' it
I'm finessin' I be flexin' and manuvering

[Verse]
Ricky Bobby watch me hit you wit it
I'ma go getta homey I will come and get it
Feel like Bo Deale I'm just tryna stack a milli
On the road to riches I ain't worried bout these bitches
And I'm switchin' gears like a transmission
I am on a mission nigga mind yo damn business
Neighborhood star, Og Kush in my cigar
She don't wanna fuck me say she wanna fuck my car
She don't like me she attracted to my Audemar
I manuver nigga you a loser
I keep 5 on me call me Carlos Boozer
I parked the red Jag pulled up in a new one
Blue one

[Hook]
Stick & move everyday
Tryna run it up all you niggas in the way
I can't stop doin' it
I'm finessin' I be outchea manuvering
Hit up then I'm shakin' it
Pay attention if you slippin' then I'm takin' it
I'ma keep doin' it
I'm finessin' I be flexin' and manuvering

[Verse]
They like, "Dang Kodak do yo thang Kodak
All that Gucci on yo body you the Mane Kodak"
I just poured 4 ounces in a root beer
I be in the field call me John Deere
All these haters in the room gotta get from round here
I'm in route, I be in and out she say she wanna chill
Dropped that neck then I left cause I ain't got no time to chill
I be runnin' thru checks I'm all about a dollar bill
Ooh (4x's), boy you flawin' I can tell
I finessed em' hit his hive then I got up outta there
Got a couple niggas ready Pompano a lot of deaths
I'm so tired of collard greens I need some fuckin' lobster tails
Skrt Skrt Skrt

[Hook]
Stick & move everyday
Tryna run it up all you niggas in the way
I can't stop doin' it
I'm finessin' I be outchea manuvering
Hit up then I'm shakin' it
Pay attention if you slippin' then I'm takin' it
I'ma keep doin' it
I'm finessin' I be flexin' and manuvering
