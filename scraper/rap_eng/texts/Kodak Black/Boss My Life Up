[Intro]
See, you gotta go against all odds, you know?
Boss your life up

[Hook]
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her

[Verse 1]
See, Imma drink a pint, lil momma damn, she got nice butt
Then you can come and tie lil momma down, you could wife her
If you got them bands, then she might fuck
I'm in Fort Myers with G1 sellin' white stuff
I had to hit that lick, it's a gamble everyday
I here you gotta take a risk
How else you think I wrapped the Cuban link around my wrist?
Now I'm bendin' corners, I got forgis on my whip
Cashed out, nigga, I've been racked up ever since
Movin' short on them bills, now I pay my momma rent
Remember sellin' dope to my next door neighbor then
Knock, knock, ain't nobody home we breakin' in

[Hook]
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her

[Verse 2]
Boss my life up, it wasn't nothin' else to do
You should try it too, you should run a check or two
I'm tryna make it out, you could be successful too
Ain't tryna make it out? Then sorry I can't hang with you
Girl I can't hang with you, lil homie I can't mess with you
I'm bout my cheddar, you should go get you some cheddar too
Go get you a check or two, that what you better do
So you can free yourself a lil bit, when you steppin' through
I had to boss up, I had to cut some people off
To be the boss, you gotta learn how to take a loss
Bible on the dash, road runnin' with the cross
Goin' up top, touch down like Randy Moss

[Hook]
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her
