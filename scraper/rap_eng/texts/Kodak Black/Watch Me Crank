[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Kodak what it do? 1k

[Hook: Ice Berg]
They ain't winnin' cause they ain't winners
And winners they'll never be cause it ain't in 'em
I done lost and won with the same niggas
I lost a couple of 'em but I ain't switchin'
I'ma jump right in that whip and watch me crank
Jump right in your bitch and watch me crank
My dog bout to jump, we bout to crank
Life house, sniper gang bout to crank

[Bridge: Kodak Black]
Jump right through your eye, young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable
Jump right through your eye young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable

[Verse 1: Ice Berg]
My lil cousin addicted to purple maple
And my Aunt Jemima really hate it
I don't pay for pussy we the murders, that's the perks of bein' famous
They call me for Love and Hip Hop but they ain't wanna pay me
I got foreigns, got trucks, and old schools
And bitch I'm still in the Bentley cause I chose to
In high school I damn near fucked the whole school
This year ain't nothin' new, I was winnin' under the old rules
Watch a nigga crank, watch a nigga crank
Know ya whole claim to me is daddy you cause she ashamed to
I'm the type to take flight anywhere and lay low
I told you see she need to befriend some LA hoes
Baby sounded crank

[Hook: Ice Berg]
They ain't winnin' cause they ain't winners
And winners they'll never be cause it ain't in 'em
I done lost and won with the same niggas
I lost a couple of 'em but I ain't switchin'
I'ma jump right in that whip and watch me crank
Jump right in your bitch and watch me crank
My dog bout to jump, we bout to crank
Life house, sniper gang bout to crank

[Bridge: Kodak Black]
Jump right through your eye, young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable
Jump right through your eye young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I remember stealin' cable
Mama told me "man up lil boy go get that paper"
I had to go get that paper
I jumped right off the porch
Grindin' in that yola, tryna buy myself a Porsche
I'm snappin' but Wallie do his thing with the fork
I'm grateful, I wake up everyday and thank the Lord
She in love with Kodak, she ain't fuckin' with you dorks
I ain't with the beef and I ain't fuckin' with the pork
Free that boy LA, yeah my lil Haitian got deported
I just hit a lick, I'm bout to sit my whip on Forgi's
My homies said if that shit ain't foreign then it's borin'
So what I did? Ran them bands up and copped a foreign

[Hook: Ice Berg]
They ain't winnin' cause they ain't winners
And winners they'll never be cause it ain't in 'em
I done lost and won with the same niggas
I lost a couple of 'em but I ain't switchin'
I'ma jump right in that whip and watch me crank
Jump right in your bitch and watch me crank
My dog bout to jump, we bout to crank
Life house, sniper gang bout to crank

[Bridge: Kodak Black]
Jump right through your eye, young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable
Jump right through your eye young nigga watch me crank
I cashed out on, I'm on the i, I got that bank
All my young niggas, they don't think, they just gon' bang ya
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable

[Outro: Kodak Black]
Call me Lil Debbie, I'm out here gettin' the cake
Just hit my celi if you lookin' for that yay
Like a print machine boy I'm all about that paper
Pay attention, I be quick to pull the cable
