[Intro]
Like I done did enough time and shit
Like by myself and shit
Like right now, I just wanna
I just wanna be with you all the time and shit
Like every day
Every day
Supreme
Beam me up, Scotty
I don't wanna be alone for a day
I rather be alone with you, bae
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone
I finally found the one I wanna keep
I'm a thug, but when it come to you, I'm sweet
I'm behind in every goal you wanna reach
If you leave me, I don't know how I'ma breathe
I don't wanna sound territorial
But I need you in my corner
Who else is there to hold ya?
Why should I be alone for?
Girl, I want you in my chest like a flu
If I ain't got you, I don't know what I'ma do

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Verse 2]
Girl, you be all in my head, I'm always thinkin' through
I don't even wanna go to bed if I can't sleep with you
Baby, I ain't take my meds 'cause all I need is you
One foot in the game, one foot in the fed, I'm breakin' rules
I'ma chase this bread and chase this loot while I'm chasin' you
Beyonc√©, Destiny's Child, you the one I cater to
Fuck a holiday, every day be Valentine's Day for you
I don't care what my dog say, two-seater, me and you in a coupe
We can't fit three people 'cause this a two-seater
Me and you ridin' with the heater
Gotta keep the Uzi tucked
Niggas be envious
Even though they know we handlin' stuff
But I gotta keep the hammer tucked 'cause even my dogs be jealous

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)
I don't wanna be alone for a day (I don't wanna be by myself)
I'd rather be alone with you, bae (don't leave me by myself)
I done did enough time in the cage (enough time in the cell)
I don't wanna be away from you, bae (let's be by ourself)

[Outro]
Just be by ourself
Me and you, no one else
Ayy, hahaha
Ayy, fuck with me
I want you in my chest like the swine flu, girl
Tied, you know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I mean? You know what I'm talkin' about?
