[Intro]
Nah baby this ain't no Dear John letter, but I hope you don't take it the wrong way man, but I need me a little space a little time to think you know, to see what I really want, and see what I really want to do and where I wanna be, but in due time you know when I realize the truth, it's you, I hope you just don't go too far away from me, or let one of these vultures come snatch your heart away from me you know if it's love it's love loyalty out  value everything, yeah loyalty, out value everything

[Chorus]
Baby it ain't you it's just me I need a break
'Cause you keep accusing me of cheating on you baby
I don't want to lose you but I need a lil space
As long as you don't move to a whole 'nother state
You still gon' be my number one
I ain't finna change my number
Just been fucking up my summer lately
And I ain't got no time to fuss on the daily

[Verse 1]
You might not understand this girl
This might actually be the best thing for us
We keep arguing every day boo
Eventually you gon' make me hate you
Me and you ain't got the same view, girl
You don't see that it's a great move, girl
It ain't gon' break you it's gon' save you, girl
'Cause I've been feeling like I hate you, girl
It's like you ain't got no faith in me
'Cause lately you've been irritating me
I don't want to drive you crazy
I'd rather drive Mercedes

[Chorus]
Baby it ain't you it's just me I need a break
'Cause you keep accusing me of cheating on you baby
I don't want to lose you but I need a lil space
As long as you don't move to a whole 'nother state
You still gon' be my number one
I ain't finna change my number
Just been fucking up my summer lately
And I ain't got no time to fuss on the daily

[Verse 2]
You don't trust me you've been losing your mind
Don't believe I'm in the studio all night
You want me to stay on FaceTime
And make these rhymes at the same time
All this questioning be having me all stressed
You been fucking up my thinking process
I took too much of shrooms I feel like I'm outer space
You keep listening to these rumors they're throwing in your face
I say all I want is you and don't listen to them bae
But I'm out here what it do you don't trust me anyway
I've been running out of love
You wanna fuss I wanna fuck

[Chorus]
Baby it ain't you it's just me I need a break
'Cause you keep accusing me of cheating on you baby
I don't want to lose you but I need a lil space
As long as you don't move to a whole 'nother state
You still gon' be my number one
I ain't finna change my number
Just been fucking up my summer lately
And I ain't got no time to fuss on the daily
