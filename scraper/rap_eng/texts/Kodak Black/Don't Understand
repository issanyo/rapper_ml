[Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Verse]
I tried to explain, I swear, I tried to explain
Think lil Kodak got it good, cause the money and the fame
I got to leave the street where it's at, fell in love with the game
Studio night and day, now they say I ain't the same or I changed, cause I don't, come to my side no more and play
I don't shoot dice no more, cause I ain't got time to hang
They say I'm going insane
They say the mollies eating up my brain
I miss my nigga Cool
Like right now, I'd be with him chasing money and be running with'em
I just tried get'em with you
They water break
I'm tired of fake niggas, I'd let you walk in my shoes but you can't fit'em
Hard for a project baby
Sometimes I hate, I let the project raise me
I'm a bastard child, so the streets made me a man
That lil baby gonna grow up to that pistol and I can see it

[Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Bridge]
When I get out of these streets and do the same things

[Verse]
When its going good God don't hear from me but when its bad I get sad and I get on my knee
Take me through this battle, but I not gonna let you leave
Send them haters around me and I won't let'm leave
Need a break just fall back and get my mind straight
Feeling like the devil took me on a blind date
I ain't coming home tonight when I'm on a mission
Niggas feening and I'm the only youngin with'em
Somethings I be tripping
Folks say I'm a ghetto child, they say I'm ignorant
Just listen
I might need a minute
I hope this beat was long, cause I need them to hear me
Can't make the lemonade, life just gave me lemons
Feel like they don't understand
They don't get it
I've been up all night
I just had to lay this verse down to clear my mind
I can't believe I thought you were my friend
Here I am in the move bleed[?] my soul again

[Hook]
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things
