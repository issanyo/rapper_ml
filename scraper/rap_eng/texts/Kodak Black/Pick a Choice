[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye Petho, that shit we was just talkin' about dawg
That shit like heavy on my mental right now
You know what I'm sayin', it's hard to just to say fuck it
When niggas was really out here thuggin' for real dawg
The projects keep callin' a nigga name dawg
Glee

[Hook: Petho Burr]
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it

[Verse 1: Petho Burr]
If I had a choice, which one I pick
I already lived the bad life, it wasn't shit
Good life was the best life, should of knew that shit
Back then I want negative shit, hangin' with the wrong clique
Now I'm on the positive, ion need no negative
I already did my negative, I'm stayin' positive
Hood stay on that negative shit, got to stay out the way and shit
Stackin' my cheese and shit, now I'm on positive
Ion need no negative, I'm wit' my negative
Now I'm stayin' positive, hood on that negative shit
Now I'm stayin' out the way and shit
Stackin' my cheese and shit
If you ain't pick a choice, what you gonna do wit' it

[Hook: Petho Burr]
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Me and Petho, we so flexible, jump through your window with no hand
Love the streets, but I can hop on this beat, and I can wake up to this
Fuck with Boosie, but I ain't signed cause I been already had started a brand
I was a kid influenced by Boosie but now I'm grown, I'm the man with the plan
Tried to offer me 10 bands, I laughed cause I wasn't with that shit
I was jackin' out of Virginia, and I already had a 100 grand
Me and Petho hold up we ain't have no lookout, we just crank
Told my nigga come on, lock with a ziplock with 'bout 30 chains
4 AM we pulled in the 'jects, Top was holdin' his camera
That was my cousin but I told him right now ain't the time for camera
I told Petho be my driver, I'm a kick door like the feds
Made me starve eatin' by myself when I had to hit that lick with [?]
Nigga when you run down better not hesitate my nigga better not be scared
Same old energy when I'm Kodak boppin' and when I'm poppin' checks
Can't give rapper snapper, wacker, jacker, jumped out in a reptar
Almost turned into a cutthroat maniac, kickin' in doors like I'm a cracka

[Hook: Petho Burr]
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it
If I had a choice, which one I pick
Good life or that bad life, which one I pick
Positive shit or negative shit, which one I pick
Only got one wish, be careful with it
