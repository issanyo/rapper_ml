Ha ha, man
Uh

[Verse 1]
In this life that I live, look, I'mma stand firm
Mamma told me bout my homeboys, but I guess I had to learn
See, people go to switchin' seats, the table never turn
Mamma told me not to touch the stove, but look, I got burned
They spreadin' lies, like a germ
Set my head head hot, like a perm
Was a jailbird, but they set me free, so the early-bird got the worm
I've been up, but I've been down
I was stuck, but I've been 'round
Pokin' windows, way outta town
I was lost, but now I'm found
These streets showed me how to be a man, cuz my dad wouldn't show me how
But it's too late to show me now
Cuz I'm in too deep with this lifestyle
Lord forgive me for that abortion, I wasn't ready to have no child
I was hittin' my girl with a bare dick, I ain't even have no lifestyle
Been out here, since a lil child
They safari, runnin' wild
Got felonies all in my file
Got me back n' forth, in the juvenile
Had to take my eyes off the prize, real quick
But, now my eyes on the prowl
I was hittin' licks, cuz I was on my dick, stayin' at my aunties house
Tryna stack them them racks in a pile
When I rap, they be like "wow"
I can't even have no friends no more, so tired of them rattin' me out
Keep my head high, to the clouds
I stay hot, on that loud
These permanent, in my mouth
Look, I'mma stay ten toes down
Gotta keep my head on a swivel
I hear these niggas will kill you
Niggas sprung out on them flockas, they ain't really got shit to live for
Young niggas, high riska's
Everyday, on the go
Already got a lil money, still out here tryna get more
This shit like shootin' dice, they just tryna hit a lick
Dope boys, they up all night, they just grindin' for a brick
I'm tryna stay out the mix
These niggas ain't real
These niggas go down, they'll snitch
Trust me, I know the deal
Lil project baby, in the field, runnin' with the still
Road runnin', for that money, wearin' Chest DeVille
I remember pourin' molly, in the Zephyr Hills
On the interstate, ridin' by them 18 wheels
