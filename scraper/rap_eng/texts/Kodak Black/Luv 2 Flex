She like me cause I'm riding on 30s
Yeah mama we gon' let me hold the ghost
I fell into some feelings, now I'm dirty
And I don't think I wanna wipe my nose
We gon' be like Bonnie and Clyde girl
Know I keep them soldiers on deck
Fuck up a check and get fly girl
Yeah I can tell that you love to flex

[Verse 1]
Flexing and finessing then you just like the kid
Damn I broke my code, girl look what you made me did
Keep it on the low, as long as you know I'm your man
Cause baby I'm an artist you gonna have me losing fans
Girl I won't pretend, you should know I'm all in
Slidin' witcha, got your hair blowing in the wind
Wassup i got ????????????
