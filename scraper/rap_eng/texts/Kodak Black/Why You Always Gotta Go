[Intro]
Ooh, why you always gotta go?
Why you gotta leave?
Why you always gotta go?
Kodak, why you gotta leave?
Why you gotta leave?
Yeah, when we link up, man, we legendary

[Chorus]
Why you always gotta go?
Kodak, why you gotta leave?
You always in the streets, you don't make no time for me
Why you always gotta leave me here on my own?
Why we can't ever spend leisure time home alone?
Probably never got your heart broke before
But you gon' get your karma for sure
Plus I heard she got a heart colder than yours
Never got my heart broke before

[Verse 1]
Baby, that's a dub, fallin' for no whore
She want love, but I just want war
I'm runnin' with my Z like my name Gohan
I bring a nigga that static, think he seein' Pok√©mon
My first hundred Gs, made it with my soldiers, huh
So when you see me with my Res on my feet, you know it's on
From the bricks, I rock a Dickie fit, I don't need Saint Laurent
Million dollar nigga, seven figure, Yves Saint Laurent
Maybe I think I'm paranoid when I'm feelin' on yo' booty
Can't break my heart 'cause I'm a thug, love just a illusion
Real thug need a lady to hold him down 'cause we go through shit
I ride or die with the hive, but we treat 'em like they groupies

[Chorus]
Why you always gotta go?
Kodak, why you gotta leave?
You always in the streets, you don't make no time for me
Why you always gotta leave me here on my own?
Why we can't ever spend leisure time home alone?
Probably never got your heart broke before
But you gon' get your karma for sure
Plus I heard she got a heart colder than yours
Never got my heart broke before

[Verse 2]
Tell karma when she come to bring her lingerie to the crib
And a towel to bathe with the couple days that she here
Yeah, I heard her heart cold, but mine's glacier to the year
Yeah, I got right in that water, I dove straight from the pier
Went to jail, and I ain't never been free for a year
Ever since then, the kid ain't never seen the streets a whole year
I ain't pressin', applyin' pressure on a bitch 'cause that's weird
I ain't stressin', 'specially never 'bout a bitch 'cause that's weird
She's a nat nat, she's a queer
She's a nat nat, she's a theory
Make it rain like a deer
Stunt severe, stuntin' yearly
Like you ain't got no ears
Express myself, but you don't hear me
I'm breakin' out in tears
Damn, lil' dear, you gon' kill me

[Chorus]
Why you always gotta go?
Kodak, why you gotta leave?
You always in the streets, you don't make no time for me
Why you always gotta leave me here on my own?
Why we can't ever spend leisure time home alone?
Probably never got your heart broke before
But you gon' get your karma for sure
Plus I heard she got a heart colder than yours
Never got my heart broke before
