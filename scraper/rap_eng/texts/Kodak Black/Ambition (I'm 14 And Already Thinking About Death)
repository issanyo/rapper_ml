[Verse 1]
I grew up lookin' up to niggas that be on the corner
I can't stop cause if I stop then I'ma dissapoint 'em
Niggas hate but I ain't worried, no I ain't worried bout 'em
My only goal is to keep courage and to make it out the bottom
Oh I was raised by the Chinese store
Even though I ain't Chinese though
Right by there is my Y and the corner store
Diamond girls guarantee you see all the hoes

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Verse 2]
The only thing I worry bout is how my grandma doin'
I'm doin' good, I'm stayin' healthy, now I'm makin' music
I'm gon' strive to success and I'm gon' try my best
I'm 14 and already thinkin' about death
Damn I was raised by the dead end
Where fake ass niggas always tryna fit in
Ambition
I'm young and ambitious
The dreams that I have, I'ma dream of madlib it
I can not caught no feelin's when no one else feel it
I cannot play my cards with no dealer to deal it
I'm just livin' with patience
Dedication and greatness
How can I be good when the hood so-so my validation?
I wish my grandma was still here to watch me grow up
I wish four clippers still here to watch me blow up
I guess things never go how you want it to
So I don't wanna be the man, I'm goin' to, uh

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to start off your dreams but it's harder to finish
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Verse 3]
I was raised by Wale and them
Get on the beat and let it breathe like oxygen
Every time they do things I follow them
But in a while a lil nigga gon' inspire them
Yeah, I even seen real niggas bail
Seen one got these beads reppin' like a Nextel
Same ones hollin' that they won't tell
Now you think you real cause your motherfuckin' phone tell
Swear these niggas think I'm in that stinker than a skunk tail
Swap my phones now my eyes liftin' like a dumbbell
Niggas sell their soul just to get a fuckin' record deal
So tell me how you fuckin' real?
My momma told me do me but just don't never steal
But I do it anywhere just to keep my pockets filled
They say one day I'm just gon' run up in the wrong house
And a nigga gon' come around and blow my brains out
Deadbeat daddy, grandma gone, that's all I know
They like me in the city, called Pompano
Grandpa was a player, he was with another woman
I just look 'em in his eyes and I see me right through him
I swear my throat hurt from tryna swallow my pride
My daddy fuckin' his god-daughter, she just 25
They got 3 kids and there's one just 5
That means he been fuckin' with her since I was 9
I just opened my eyes and let my ears listen
Friends ain't friends, lil nigga pay attention
Swear my only friends J-Crack and Lil Raw
Man we go back like Al Capone and cigars
And I know that some niggas don't want me to succeed
I just look past it keep balanced stay on my two feet
Got to watch my back cause niggas play keeps
My uncle looked at the weed, he ain't even got money to eat
And God damn, I swear my life crazy
Other people peep my swag, now they think I got a gammie
I'ma live my life
Man you never know, I might die tonight
But God with me
And I ain't gon' leave this world on no plain mission
That's my ambition

[Hook]
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition

[Outro]
Yeah half my life spent tryna find somethin' to do with the time we got. The time we got is spent tryna find somethin'. And look I heard behind every destined man is a surprised woman, I just gotta stay humble even though I'm hungry. I thought to myself being with no ambition, you ain't livin'
