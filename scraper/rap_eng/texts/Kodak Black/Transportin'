[Intro]
Pockets so fat call me orbit
Norbit, I mean
Ain’t gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded

[Chorus]
Ain’t gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' sporty, I can’t control it
I’m doing fraud, got that bag, yeah I’m transportin'
I got that bag on me nigga, like I'm Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda repost it
I ain’t post his mixtape ‘cause I don’t fuck with shorty

[Verse 1]
I be booted to the morning, PM to the morning
My lil' woadie wanna bag him, he just want a Rollie
Hold up nigga, don't you owe me? Yeah you owe me, don't it?
Like I'm in Islands of Adventure how I stay rolling
Tryna diss me
I leave you six feet
She say she miss me
She wanna kiss me
Damn, I’m so crispy
Xans got me dizzy
Try me I ain't shy
I keep that Glizzy
I was spendin' (yeah yeah)
Frisbee
What the lick read?
Baby, come and lick me
V12, how I’m ridin' in the 6 speed
I be ballin' on you niggas out of this league

[Chorus]
Ain’t gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' sporty, I can’t control it
I’m doing fraud, got that bag, yeah I’m transportin'
I got that bag on me nigga, like I'm Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda repost it
I ain’t post his mixtape ‘cause I don’t fuck with shorty

[Verse 2]
Yeah, that Glock got extended like a outlet
How you outchea?
I ain’t catch you out yet
I’m so damn fly, I do not step
Yeah I pop molly and I pop checks
Ion't know where I'm goin', I'm just floatin'
My dawg got gun license but he let me hold it
All these niggas phony, I do not condone it
I be goin' ham, I do not baloney
It's a Kodak moment, yeah
Bought it ‘cause I wanted it
I be on the corner, yeah
Fuck the law enforcement
Project Baby got no stroller but I keep pushin'
Shawty love for me to choke her when I'm in that pussy

[Chorus]
Ain’t gotta wait to make no moves 'cause I be loaded
Why you out here drinkin' 40's, I just tote it
Still that same nigga in a foreign, but it's stolen
Ridin' sporty, actin' sporty, I can’t control it
I’m doing fraud, got that bag, yeah I’m transportin'
I got that bag on me nigga, like I'm Jansportin'
He dropped his mixtape, thought I woulda repost it
I ain’t post his mixtape ‘cause I don’t fuck with shorty
