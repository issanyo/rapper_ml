Ion Catch Feelings Bitch I Catch Flight
I Use To Sell Rocks Now Im Rocking Mic's
Imma Show You What a boss​ Look Like
Run Up On Me Imma Hit Em On Sight
I Was Living Wrong, Got My Money Right
I Hustled All Day, Hustled All Night
Told Me Life Is A Gamble​​​ But I Was Shooting Dice
And Ion Catch Feelings Bitch I Catch Flight

[Verse 1]
They Say My Flow Mean, Dresscode Nice
I'll Pull Up In A Jag, used to steal bikes
Black Nigga, Not A Racist, I Was Selling White
I Had To Stay Down, Now, My Car Sitting High
I Was Bussin' Licks, Putting Hits, Totin' Heat
Jumped In Head First, I Was In deep​​​
Pockets Full Of Rocks, Not A Kid
Rocked the beat, shook the streets
I can't let them crackers down me
AD put me on my feet, said my time here
Audemar wrap my wrist, yeah my time clear
And I don't see you hating niggas, I be going blind
I'm on my first class shit, I be so fly

[Verse 2]
I'm picking up checks, I don't fall in love
I don't catch feelings, I just catch a nut
I was dead broke nigga, now I live it up
Took off in a private jet and landed on the plug
Keep designer on my body, I'm an (?)
I'm a sniper
Run up on me, don't you think about it
I just poured up a four, sipping dirty Fanta
I was catching the city bus now I'm in a Phantom
I was popping down rocks, giving licks to Santa
Project baby
Shitting on a nigga, where my pamper?
Cake like my birthday
Blow it like a candle
Got this shit under control, about to flip the channel
