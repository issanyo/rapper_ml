[Hook: Jack Boy]
This shit ain't just happen overnight
It took time for me to run my check up
Puttin' in work, can't cheat the grind
It took time for me to run my check up
Keep the 45 when I slide
Wanna see me down cause I ran my check up
Everybody sayin' it's my time
I'm in my prize, I'm bout to run my check up
Run my check up, I'mma run my check up
Run my check up, I'm bout to run my check up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ooooh

[Verse 1: Jack Boy]
Run the check up, I'm bout to overlap ya
Finessin', had to overtax ya
Dress classic, but I'm totin' ratchets
No license, still dippin' through traffic
Ride with my youngins
At the red light, green light we dumpin'
Trap still jumpin', licks still comin'
Had to make something outta nothing
In and outta cells, been through hell
I was 14, sittin' in jail
I ain't tell, kept my lips sealed like mail
Want beef? I give shells, I give [?]
Can't get you, get your momma
Or get your father, cut him up like a barber
Rock on my hip, totin' Sean Carter
Jumped in the game late, should've been a starter
When I get mad, I get trigger-happy
Move off impulse, lose by fetti
Blow the fetti
My do a show and drop four g's, thirties on a Chevy
Or drop Larry, mouthpiece scary
Real rap, real life, no Tyler Perry
Stopped smokin' weed, still on molly
Jackboy, he a jigga-holic
Pull up in that what you call it?
Two Glock shorty, clip hold 30
Try and cross me like you Curry
Put 30 in your jersey
I'm not servin', bitch I'm lurkin'
Me and Bill in a suburban
Up the road, window pokin'
Schemin', 7 in the mornin'
Bitch I'm on it, bitch I'm on it
I just booted on the monkey
Now you wanna be my homie?
Nah, I'm staright, I got this on me
Sniper!

[Hook: Jack Boy]
This shit ain't just happen overnight
It took time for me to run my check up
Puttin' in work, can't cheat the grind
It took time for me to run my check up
Keep the 45 when I slide
Wanna see me down cause I ran my check up
Everybody sayin' it's my time
I'm in my prize, I'm bout to run my check up
Run my check up, I'mma run my check up
Run my check up, I'm bout to run my check up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ooooh

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'mma run that check up crazy like I'm in the Olympics
It's lil Kodak, I be snappin' like I'm photogenic
I left the high broke, I came back with some money
Grind hard till' everybody say that they your cousin
It ain't happen overnight, a nigga was out here hustlin'
I remember when I was broke and I ain't have nothin'
Me and Jackboy, we be thuggin', we be roadrunnin'
If you lookin' for me, you can catch me on the Ugly
Oh I just want some sucky-sucky, don't want no lovey-dovey
On 1800, I hit a nigga for a whole onion
I'm a Haitian boy, got people love me way in London
I'm a Haitian boy, you know I'm runnin' with them zombies
Like waste management, how niggas quick to go to dumpin'
How I pull up in that orange, look like a damn pumpkin
I remember when I ain't have it now I fuckin' got it
And the way I run that check up, you could call me Sonic

[Hook: Jack Boy]
This shit ain't just happen overnight
It took time for me to run my check up
Puttin' in work, can't cheat the grind
It took time for me to run my check up
Keep the 45 when I slide
Wanna see me down cause I ran my check up
Everybody sayin' it's my time
I'm in my prize, I'm bout to run my check up
Run my check up, I'mma run my check up
Run my check up, I'm bout to run my check up
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, ooooh
