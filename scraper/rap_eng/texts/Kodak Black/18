[Intro]
I'm on 18, this that project baby
I'm so 18, I'm so, I'm so 18
I'm so 18, posted on 18

[Hook]
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me

[Verse 1]
Fuck a day care, I'm that project baby
In the strip club and I ain't even 18
Got a 9 with the beam, clip by 18
Nigga I be gettin' to the cake, I love that pastry
Now I eat fillet mignon, no more babies
Out here livin' on my own like I'm 18
I'm a minor, but I ain't like the other kids
My bitch the baddest, I still got my other bitch
I ain't with the fuckery, so don't you fuck with me
Keep that tooley on me like it's stuck to me
1800, right here on the ugly
It's the fuckin' kid and my bitch Colombian

[Hook]
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me

[Verse 2]
I'm so 18, you can call me Peyton
Posted on the corner, I ain't even base yet
I'm so fly, I swear I got here on the DayJet
I don't work, I put in work, I need 'em paychecks
I need your check, I need they check
I keep that magnum, I ain't talkin' safe sex
You been workin' all your life, you ain't get paid yet
You been on your way forever, you ain't came yet
18 double 0, 18 double 0, 18 double 0
Bring it to your door, just like Domino
Boy your money low, (Got Bills like buffalo)
Boy your money low
18 double 0, 18 double 0, 18 double 0

[Hook]
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me
I'm on 18, always on 18
1800, born on the same street
I'm so 18, just like momma made me
Keep it 18, that's how my uncle raised me
