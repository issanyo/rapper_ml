[Hook: Humble Haitian]
They don't know what I've been through
Trappin' I ain't worried 'bout you
Ain't nothin' you could do I can't do
But, you can't walk a mile in my shoe
Police coming 'bout to pull you
Ridin' dirty what you gonna do?
Boy you should've stayed in school
I don't think these streets for you

[Verse 1: Humble Haitian]
They don't know that I be trappin'
Say he get money but I know he cappin'
Play with them bands no I don't just be rappin'
Play with my money that how shit be happenin'
[?]
Front going slow so we started to juggin'
Lookin' for pieces we started to pokin'
Nobody [?]
All of my niggas be smoother than lotion
[?]
I'm not from here [?]
Man that lil bitch she now thought she was golden
But I found out now she was just a digger
Police come in make that dope disappear
Ain't poppin' that molly pill cause its too clear
[?]

[Hook: Humble Haitian]
They don't know what I've been through
Trappin' I ain't worried 'bout you
Ain't nothin' you could do I can't do
But, you can't walk a mile in my shoe
Police coming 'bout to pull you
Ridin' dirty what you gonna do?
Boy you should've stayed in school
I don't think these streets for you

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
They don't know me they just know I rap (You don't know me)
You know Kodak you don't know J Black (That's the real me)
1634 remember sleeping in the trap
We ain't had no central air we had a attic full of rats
They don't know 'bout the times when I used to pull up in a splat
When we got kicked out the projects went to thuggin' across the tracks
First time Imma go in your front door then imma go and hit the back
They don't know I was posted late night with my whole 50 pack (I was selling hard)

[Hook: Humble Haitian]
They don't know what I've been through
Trappin' I ain't worried 'bout you
Ain't nothin' you could do I can't do
But, you can't walk a mile in my shoe
Police coming 'bout to pull you
Ridin' dirty what you gonna do?
Boy you should've stayed in school
I don't think these streets for you
