[Hook]

So I can get my time, any second
Help me get my mind, cause I'm stressing
Mama said I shine right, cause I'm destined
Damn I live a hard life, It's a blessing

State to state I'm progressing
Back and forth I'm stepping
Ain't going back nomore they won't let me
Look at my necklace, pull up in the exess, pull up in bentleys, jumping out Lexus and jetsey
I'm swimming in the money fuck a jet skie, let reach
Test me, 40 cal in a kick in like a jetlee
Married to the money she said yes to me
And she don't want no ugly bitch to be next to me
Money talk yall can't even send a text to me
I'm whipping the dope they want the recipe

[Hook]
I buy Rolexes, yeah
So I can get my time, any second
Help me get my mind, cause I'm stressing

Damn I live a hard life, It's a blessing

[Verse 2]
Lime light, I'm riding rover
Yeah I live the high life, ain't never sober
Early bird time flies, I'm getting older
First they was on my side
They switched over
Can't open my eyes, I'm blowing dozier
Gambling wid my life, it's like poker
30 inches on my ride boy don't go dea them boy low dea
Oh dea like, dea go dat Zoe dea
So so rare, red bottom so fresh I bought 4 pair
Ion feel nun so ion go bare
Ion catch feelings I catch flights in in yo hoe air

[Hook]
I buy Rolexes, yeah
So I can get my time, any second
Help me get my mind, cause I'm stressing
Mama said I shine right, cause I'm destined
Damn I live a hard life, It's a blessing
Pan up wid one mic, it's a weapon
How Ima get my grind right, I'm just guessin
