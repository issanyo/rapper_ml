[Intro]
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?

[Verse 1]
I hope you ain't nothing like my old friends
Or any other women that I had
I know I'm better than your ex-boyfriend
Or any other niggas from the past
Can I take you where I learned the game from?
Show you why I act the way I act
Lately, I've been on a fucking marathon
Running to the motherfucking cash
I'm liking how you make a brother laugh
Can I come and get you in a Jag?
Then, hit it in the backseat of the Jag
Baby girl, I know you like my swag

[Chorus]
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Verse 2]
I'm just so excited that I'm free
Sometimes, it be feeling like a dream
Can a young brother get some sleep?
Lately, I've been working over 3
Mama told me, "Son, I never hear from you"
Cook something, you don't even eat
Mama, I'm just trying to make a mil' for you
Put you in a condo on the beach

[Chorus]
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be

[Verse 3]
Why they just can't let a nigga be?
I've been busy, I've been doing me
Have you thinking I've been with the Zoe pound
Me and all my niggas come in deep
On the ground, young ten toes down
I can put a nigga on his feet
I caught the Audi, then I ran the check up
And, I ain't even been out here a week
Got my shooter playing hide and seek
Just in case you niggas try and creep
Everybody wanna be your friend now
Better watch the company you keep
Everybody got they fucking hand out
See you eating now they want a piece
Oh, that's Kodak Black, I've been hearing bout'
He the hottest nigga in the streets
If you love me, love a nigga deep
When you see me, what you really see?
To everybody else, I was a sour guy
But, I be treating you a little sweet
I'm so close to showing her my real side
Show this girl another side of me
I think we've been getting along real fine
You love it when I hit it on the beach
I've been working hard, ain't got no spare time
I can't even party on the week
I'm just trying to see where your head at
When you grow up, what you wanna be?
Run up on a nigga, where the bread at?
I be going ham for the cheese
I just wanna see all of my niggas home
They can't wait to get back on the streets
I just talked to Jackboy on collect phone
He told me he ain't trying to take the plea

[Outro]
For my niggas, I'll swim across the sea
