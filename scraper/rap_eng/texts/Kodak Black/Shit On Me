[Intro: Kodak Black]
Kodak why you strapped like that
Why you act like that
Cause I got it by myself

[Hook]
Lil' Shorty got that shit in his pants (Lil Shorty got that shit)
40 with the dick at the end (40 with the Dick)
They know I keep that shit on me (They know I keep that shit on me)
No they won't hit no lick on me (No they won't hit no lick on me)
Come here break yo neck for me baby (Come here break yo neck)
Come here sign a check for me baby (Come here sign a check)
She gone take a risk for me (She gone take a risk)
I think this the bitch for me (She might be my bitch)

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I just went up top like elavators
About to come back down with 20 Gs
I be sippin' Codein kickin' flavor
I got baby bottles full of lean
Girl you be on my dick
I think its the Cuban on my wrist
Got her goin through the bank line
Now im sliding in the audi a5
Free Lil Cool doin that time
Freeman with the stick he doin' fed time
I'm ballin like the Knicks
I remember I was sellin' nicks
Smokin gas but your whip on E
She find out you a lame now your bitch on me
Watch out I'm bouta blow
Got niggas locked up eating Sloppy Joe

[Hook]
Lil' Shorty got that shit in his pants(Lil Shorty got that shit)

They know I keep that shit on me(They know I keep that shit on me)
No they won't hit no lick on me(No they won't hit no lick on me)
Come here break yo neck for me baby(Come here break yo neck)

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Hoe you can't get this dick for free
Fuck a bodyguard, I got that shit on me
That money got me geeked
I'm in Miami runnin with my heat
Ratatouille boy I'm comin' for my cheese
Thought it was Thanksgiving how I stuffed it in my jeans
In science class high as hell
I'm floatin off that loud I feel like Tinker Bell
Now she dont wanna leave here
Girl you gotta go home you can't sleep here
No cardio Im runnin' up a check
Leave you where you stand my niggas dumpin' on the set
Girl you can't be calling me this late
Lil' Shorty wanna see me everyday
On molly and a double cup
Two Pieces on me just like Reeses Butter Cup
