[Intro]
You know, project baby comin' up and shit
I was clutchin' on twenty-eight grams of crack cocaine
But then I fell in love with a twenty-eight year old
Both of them twenty-eight

[Chorus]
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that medicate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no MedicAid-aid-aid-aid
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that Mary Kate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no medicate-ate-ate-ate

[Verse 1]
I just dropped that twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I whipped it in my new play-aye-aye-aye
I put the pot on the floor
So it could stick a little more
Drop Palmolive in your dope
So it could stick a lil' more
Twenty-eight, that's my bae-aye-aye-aye
I spent a brick on my chain-aye-aye-aye
Thirty-six in my safe
Thirty clip to your face
You snatch my chain, you gon' die
So why would a nigga try?

[Chorus]
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that medicate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no MedicAid-aid-aid-aid
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that medicate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no MedicAid-aid-aid-aid

[Verse 2]
She twenty-eight, she got the whip
My first verse was water whip
My second verse was 'bout my baby girl, she
Don't even like to go to work without me
I be here sellin' yola
She was with me in the yoda
I met her on that ugly corner
Remember runnin' with that poker
Out of state doin' fraud-aww-aww-aww
That my baby, that my broad-aww-aww-aww
I'm too young, girl, that's illegal
I'm 'bout to let her meet my people

[Chorus]
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that medicate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no MedicAid-aid-aid-aid
My lil' baby twenty-eight-eight-eight-eight
I be out here sellin' yay-yay-yay-yay
I be on that medicate-ate-ate-ate
I don't even got no MedicAid-aid-aid-aid
