[Intro]
Money gave him power and a bigger ego
That money gave him power and a bigger ego
I'm in a Thunderbird, I'm slidin'  wit' my Desert Eagle

[Verse 1]
Money gave him power and a bigger ego
Free my nigga Cool
My nigga we tight like speedo
All my niggas goin' fast, they gettin' Rico
Free my nigga Jackboy we like Stitch and Lilo
I still be ridin' wit' fye, steering wheel on the right
I still be out of my mind, still be gettin' real high
I be on D'use√© no lie, smokin' on cherry pie
I promise I ain't goin', that's that other guy
I ain't take no shortcut, this shit ain't come easy
Christian Louboutin is drippin'
When I step, I'm leakin'
Christian Louboutin, you would think I'm bleeding
They say that I'm next, don't jinx me
Eat it up, baby, then drink me
I ain't ever ask for nothing, my momma said "Don't beg"
If you got it and I want it, then I'm on your head
My nigga been hidin' lately, he think I want him dead
But I don't want you to die, I want you to see me shine
I couldn't make lemonade, so I made lemon-lime
Life gave me lemons, so I made lemon-lime
Kodak that nigga that green, Kodak that nigga that slime
That money done gave me power, money done turned me sour
I remember I was rockin' Enyce, now I rock Givenchy
Run up on me, that's risky
Run up on me, don't tempt me
My tank on full, you empty
Smokin' on gas like Wawa
Project Baby, got Promethazine all in my baba
Free my nigga, Flippa my nigga, flip a nigga like Krabby Patty
Flyin' anywhere, my propellers be on aerobatics
All I know is rob, all I know is jack it
I ain't ever had no job, I ain't ever had no daddy
Dress it up, baby, like salad
Eat it up, baby, you nasty
Ain't got no snacks in the cabinet, just some goddamn ratchets
If Cardi be winnin', I'm winnin', 'cause that's my goddamn twin
If Cardi B win, I win
Cardi B won, I won
My bitch said she want her hair done, part in the middle wit' a bun
My bitch said she want her nails done, French tip, London
My bitch said she want her hair done, lace front, no bun
My bitch said she want her toes done, French tip, London
I don't wanna see you cry, momma wipe yo' eyes
I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly

[Outro]
I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly
I don't wanna do no more time, I want you to see me fly
