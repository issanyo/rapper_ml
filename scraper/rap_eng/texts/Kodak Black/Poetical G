[Intro]
Aye, it's two thousand eighteen hundred
1800 block
Free Jackboy
Sniper Gang

[Chorus]
We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
I pray to God that I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money, but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change
All the love I got for you is never gone change
Shit ain't never, never, ever gone be the same
Shawty say she love me, so she tatted my name
So I ever leave her then I'm leavin' a stain

[Verse]
Leavin' 'em all, tryna hide the scars
I can't hide my carnality, my personality
I am who I are
I'm sitting in the dark
All I want to do is shine, they throwing shade on me
I turnt that money clean off of living dirty
Can't leave the streets alone
It left a stain on me
I get on this beat like it's my testimony
We do the same thing, but won't do it the same
And everything they do it's like they all changed
I got skeletons in my closet by my Balmain
That's my shooter coming around here
That's my dawg, man
I promise we gone all ball, man
Just bought a mansion, you just bought a damn chain
I'm about wacking, hope you about the same thing
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I think about my woe, I just popped a xanny
I'm still fed up, but I'm countin' fetty
I tried to forgive you but something wouldn't let me
I be going too hard I might break something
I get retarded, boy, I shake something

[Chorus]
We do the same thing but won't do it the same
I pray to God I ain't losing my brain
Made a lot of music to forget all of my pain
I just wanted money but it came with some fame
I get on the beat, and I just be wanting to sing
Even though I wanted to it's never gone change
All the love I got for you is never gone change
Shit ain't never, never gone be the same
Shawty say she love me, so she tatted my name
So I ever leave her then I'm leavin' a stain
