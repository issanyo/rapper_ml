[Intro: Kodak Black]
Ayy man, niggas ready to lose their lives about that money man
Niggas going state to state man
Watch that low drop, niggas goin' viral man
Shoutout to Skooly

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You gon' do my whole team, girl you goin' viral
I done finally came up, it's been a long while
Pharoah shoulda took the P, 'stead he lost trial
My young niggas on a bean and they goin' wild
I just saw you on TV, boy you goin' viral
I can't hear nothin' you said, cause I'm smokin' loud
I was put in by a cell, but I'm home now
I done made it through the struggle, now I'm goin' viral

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Lil' homie on his dick, he 'bout to go en route
He just tinted up the rental, now he northbound
And once he touchdown with them bands, man it's goin' down
He hit the dentist puttin' every dime in his mouth
I might need a referee, these niggas so foul
If you ain't callin' 'bout no money, nigga don't dial
I stay on my P's and Q's, I'm ten toes down
I just left from out the U cause the Trues out
My lil' nigga DJ wil' he need to slow down
Out here wit his shirt off walking with his pole out
I stay humble, I've been grindin' for forever
Just got out last month and I'm applyin' pressure

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You gon' do my whole team, girl you goin' viral
I done finally came up, it's been a long while
Pharoah shoulda took the P, 'stead he lost trial
My young niggas on a bean and they goin' wild
I just saw you on TV, boy you goin' viral
I can't hear nothin' you said, cause I'm smokin' loud
I was put in by a cell, but I'm home now
I done made it through the struggle, now I'm goin' viral

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
I came home, broke the internet, I'm goin' viral
Perfect timin', catch it, nigga, a Drew Brees spiral
My daughter say "I told y'all mane"
She done went viral
Fucked every stripper with a name
Boy my dick viral
I'm countin' money on the bed
This a big pot
Sick spot, Boosie this, Boosie that, I'm the shit now
My clothin' line on fire, a nigga really straight
Check out my wrist game, bitch
This a Audi 8
In Magic City, throwin' fifties a nigga really wildin'
In Hawaii I went viral, I fucked the whole island
In 09' I went viral, I'm talkin' 8 bodies
I took crumbs and made profit
Now I got it and I'm viral

[Hook: Kodak Black]
You gon' do my whole team, girl you goin' viral
I done finally came up, it's been a long while
Pharoah shoulda took the P, 'stead he lost trial
My young niggas on a bean and they goin' wild
I just saw you on TV, boy you goin' viral
I can't hear nothin' you said, cause I'm smokin' loud
I was put in by a cell, but I'm home now
I done made it through the struggle, now I'm goin' viral
