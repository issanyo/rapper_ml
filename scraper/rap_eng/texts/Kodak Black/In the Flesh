[Intro]
Money talk, these diamonds on my cavity
Money talk

[Verse 1]
Money talk, these diamonds on my cavity
Scoopin' up all my bitches out the magazine
Cartier, my sight virtual reality
Hoppin' up out the space coupe with no gravity
I need me somebody to take the edge off
Ten toes and they painted, they don't let me down
Nigga that money old just like I'm Redd Foxx
Swear we still gon' turn up when the Feds watch
Nigga ain't got no love, ain't got no reasonin'
Baby, I switched the sauce up every seasonin'
Turned up in a coupe, they're goin' to Venus, yeah
Jump up in that pussy with my feelings in it

[Chorus]
I'm jumpin' up in that pussy like I'm needlin'
Fresh up outta jail, so I'ma leave it in
Hittin' from the back like I'm gon' leave again
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect

[Verse 2]
Them VVs in my mouth are platinum flawless diamonds
Hopped out with that AP watch on like it's perfect timin'
If that nigga dress like me he tryna ride tonight
If that nigga dress like me, he tryna take a life
I say ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh?
You ain't understand me, I got more precise
I say ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh
Just got out today, already sent my dawg a kite
Remember I was on that flight totin' pipes, out here rollin' dice
Now I get a hundred K to rock the mic
Got lil' baby eatin' Molly like it's Mike & Ike
I just wanna fly, don't wanna die, so I be walkin' light (Walkin' light)

[Chorus]
I'm jumpin' up in that pussy like I'm needlin'
Fresh up outta jail, so I'ma leave it in
Hittin' from the back like I'm gon' leave again
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect

[Bridge]
I say ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh?
Ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh?
I say ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh?
Ain't I resurrect, how I pull up in the flesh?
Just got out today, already sent my dawg a kite
You ain't understand me, I got more precise

[Chorus]
I'm jumpin' up in that pussy like I'm needlin'
Fresh up outta jail, so I'ma leave it in
Hittin' from the back like I'm gon' leave again
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
If I die tonight, I bet I'll resurrect
