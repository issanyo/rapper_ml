[Intro: Kodak Black]
This the diary of a real nigga, and if its chapter 3, lil Kodak the Kolyons they are me
I put my heart in it, I might drown, I'm knee deep
You open up my diary and this what you gon' see

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Dear diary: I guess you hear from me again
I'm losing so much-a homies guessin you my real friend
Cuz I come to you, yea in this booth you understand
Death before dishonor, ain't no need to pretend
All my brothers' people, yea I'm riding til the end
Them my real people, and I hope this never end
Fakin' niggas went ghost, and we were caught up in a trend
Bruh i gotta blow, and Dirty said he wanted bands
Koly want a Jag, you the man with the plan
I been playing in the mud, I had to dirty my hands
[Stack?] he a real nigga, all these niggas here my kin
How you gon' be running with killers [...?...]
Shouts out to lil Plies, he gon' flex too
Lil Boosie with them Cuban links, I want some on my neck too
This the diary, autobiography
All this hittin', I wish my mama hit the lottery

[Verse 2: Koly P]
This the diary of a real nigga, and this the chapter 3
We lost Wayne and Cheezy P
A couple friends turned their backs
I had to take that loss to get right back
THEM CRACKAZ NEED TO FREE LIL KODAK BLACK
Now this shit done got jank again
These bougie bitches actin' stank again
I put in work just like the maintenance man
I'm knee deep in these streets, you fuck niggas got your ankles in
Reporting from the hood its Koly P I'm like the anchorman
I think i can, be a bigger person than I [?] the man
He bless you when you sneeze you supposed to thank the man
Don't want no cuz these pussies they gon' take the stand
Got judge wearing robes on the low working for the [?]
Its crazy, tricks say they Koly's lil baby
Just to make em outta work or join the army and the navy
They prayed for Orlando, gave a fuck about lil Haiti
I hear the crackers stealin' organs man this shit done got crazy

[Outro: Kodak Black]
This the diary of a real nigga, and if its chapter 3, lil Kodak the Kolyons they are me
I put my heart in it, I might drown, I'm knee deep
You open up my diary and this what you gon' see
Dear diary, sincerely, lil Kolyon
I'm praying to stack them racks when I steady be doing wrong
I got the same attitude when I'm flowing on these songs
And when I'm running in these homes
