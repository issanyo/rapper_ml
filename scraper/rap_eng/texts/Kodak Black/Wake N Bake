[Intro]
It's lil Kodak, man
This for all my niggas on the paper chase, man
Do whatever it take to get that cake, man
Ain't no other way tryna get it straight, man

[Hook]
Look, put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' they nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break
Put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break

[Verse 1]
Call it February, how I drop a 28
Put me in the game, coach, so I can make a play
All my people, in the bleacher's, we gon' celebrate
When my homie crossed over, had to fade away
This for everybody, grew up off of section 8
Keep your head up, cause you gon' see a better day
Wake n bake, smokin' purple, buzz like a grape
Wake n pray, poking windows, then we in your place
Stephen Curry for the guap, 30 to your face
So much money on my mind, I can't even think
You can't even close your eyes, niggas come and take
Watch the niggas you around, don't you even play
Boy, I swear to God, I just caught another case
Tired of makin' momma cry, stressin', losin' weight
Baby, I can't be your hero, I can't save the day
But, I'm superman fly, with my fuckin' cape

[Hook]
Look, put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break
Put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break

[Verse 2]
All my niggas takin' chances, I know how it go
Wake n break, poke your window, we just pop and go
Playin' with them bands, I ain't talkin' rock n roll
This for all my niggas locked up, eatin' sloppy joes
All my niggas hungry, they say they need a plate
Put me in the game, coach, so I can lead the way
I'm just glad to be here, to see another day
Road runnin', gotta get it, any other way
I need a mill', but for now, I need a hunnid K
You gon' get it, if you wait, that's what my momma say
I had dreams of bein' a man, since the second grade
While you niggas gettin' pussy, I'm just gettin' paid
Me and Jackboy, car jackin', switchin' lanes
Yeah, we found a chop shop, took it with a day
Came up, off of cash, for gold snatchin' chains
How I'm finna shine, everybody throwin' shade

[Hook]
Look, put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break
Put me in the game, I'm just tryna make a play
This for all my niggas out here, tryna make it shake
Smokin' purple, every mornin' nigga wake n bake
Poke in windows, early mornin', call it wake n break
