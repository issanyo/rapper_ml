I be goin' too crazy (Crazy)
Hit a famous ho, which one? Yeah
Ain't no stopping me
Talk on the 'net, don't apply to me
I can't be with these rap niggas
I know my dawgs gon' slide for me
All that talk, that's cap, nigga
Y'all be soundin' like cops to me
Layin' on the jet with a MAC, nigga
Bust down, ain't no robbin' me
I donâ€™t want my old bitch back (I don't wanna her)
Shit, damn, but I still wanna fuck, uh (Yeah)
I be overload with the drip (Drip)
Shit might spill in my cup, uh
I can't fuck with these niggas (Fuck 'em)
But I still send 'em my love (Yeah)
I ain't gotta trap no more (No)
I'ma just give 'em my plug (Yeah)

And we goin' back to back, huh

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Poppin' niggas like tic-tac-toe
Sippin' Ace of Spades, I do
Got the K everywhere I go
Don't come to me 'bout no ho
Poppin' niggas like Tic Tac Toe
Sippin' Ace of Spades, I do
Got the K everywhere I go
Don't come to me 'bout no ho
Don't come to me 'bout no rumor
My partner, he got a tumor
Every day, I keep a ruler
Just me, I don't need no shooter
Don't come to me 'bout no mess
Want beef, I'm sayin' less
It ain't nothin' to get you wet
Make a movie on your set

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Benji, Benji, Benji on Benjis (Benjis)
Keepin' my hoes in that Fendi (That Fendi)
Whippin' that Rolls like a hemi (Skrrt)
Face down, smearin' her Fenty, uh
Niggas, they always got somethin' to say
See 'em, it's nothin' to talk about (Nothin')
Catch you and you tried to stunt in the club
You gettin' smoked in the parking lot
Came on the block (Uh), brand new Saint Laurent (Whoa)
I gotta lay off designer 'cause honestly I've just been makin' 'em hot (Yeah)
I'm not a Muslim but I had to put in them prayers to make it sell out (Woo)
I know my way to the top
I took a circle and made it a block, run (Break it down)
Red fish, blue fish, old bitch, new bitch (New bitch)
Niggas said it's on sight, see me, he ain't do shit, uh
We got them thirties on thirties (Thirties)
Phantom is newer than Jersey (Jersey)
I put that bitch in a figure four
Fuck it, I'm doin' her dirty (Dirty)
Don't even know what I'm in it for (I don't)
I probably get her a Rollie (A Rollie)
I probably get her Chanel, Chanel
And then she know I'm fuckin' her homies (Her homies)
Keep a bad bitch in my face (My face)
She tryin' to get to first place (First place)
We don't pop X, pop Ace (Pop Ace)
And we only cop by case, huh

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Poppin' niggas like tic-tac-toe
Sippin' Ace of Spades, I do
Got the K everywhere I go
Don't come to me 'bout no ho
Poppin' niggas like Tic Tac Toe
Sippin' Ace of Spades, I do
Got the K everywhere I go
Don't come to me 'bout no ho
Don't come to me 'bout no rumor
My partner, he got a tumor
Every day, I keep a ruler
Just me, I don't need no shooter
Don't come to me 'bout no mess
Want beef, I'm sayin' less
It ain't nothin' to get you wet
Make a movie on your set
