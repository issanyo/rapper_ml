[Intro]
That money don't sleep, you know what I'm sayin'?
So why you niggas be sleepin' on the money?
Keep that shit 1k

[Chorus]
If you want this shit, you gotta be up late
I don't want it now, I want it everyday
Pull up drop top, fully loaded Wraith
Let the Glock pop, it don't hesitate
And I keep the strap on me, just in case
A broke bitch always got somethin' to say
You don't want no money, wanna get laid
I was doin' fraud, I was sellin' lace

[Verse 1]
Drivin' too fast, it just ain't safe
I be all gas nigga, no brake
Copped a C-class like I'm in the sixth grade
Brought my BB gun to school in the fifth grade
Thinkin' 'bout my nigga Cool, hope he OK
I just bought a PS4, but I don't play
And my nigga slidin' right behind me with the K
If I give you somethin', nigga you better say thanks
And I remember eatin' peanut butter treats
I ain't hit my lady in a couple days
You don't know what I had to go through
You don't know what I had to go do
In the studio, you know I keep the Pro Tools
I be saucin' on these bitches, I'm so smooth
Hey, let me show you how the VVS gleam
I ain't eat no pussy, diamonds on my teeth

[Chorus]
If you want this shit, you gotta be up late
I don't want it now, I want it everyday
Pull up drop top, fully loaded Wraith
Let the Glock pop, it don't hesitate
And I keep the strap on me, just in case
A broke bitch always got somethin' to say
You don't want no money, wanna get laid
I was doin' fraud, I was sellin' lace

[Verse 2]
(Yo, come on, yo, come on, yo, come on)
I pop the checks and get that money out of state
I be boppin' on yo' nigga like I'm on the stage
Want my nigga home so bad, you know the lawyer paid
And even though you gone, I keep the commissary straight
Slime in the Tahoe ridin' with that SK
No Wells Fargo, nigga I got big bank
I be rappin' 'bout it, 'cause I'm livin' this way
Top nigga, I been put up in a fish tank
Took that bitch to Chik-Fil-A, she said she wanna steak
They had to let me outta jail for my birthday
This ain't no water gun but when I see you I'ma spray
Mine a sniper, quick to shoot I fuck with Lil Tay
And this money doin' somethin' to my membrane
Shawty know I love that head, I love that migraine
And I just wanna be new Beyonc√©
Crib so big, it's like an arcade

[Chorus]
If you want this shit, you gotta be up late
I don't want it now, I want it everyday
Pull up drop top, fully loaded Wraith
Let the Glock pop, it don't hesitate
And I keep the strap on me, just in case
A broke bitch always got somethin' to say
You don't want no money, wanna get laid
I was doin' fraud, I was sellin' lace
