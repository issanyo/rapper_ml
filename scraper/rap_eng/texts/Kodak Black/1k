[Hook]
I be so damn fly nigga
I ain't got a cape
Got tired of eating fries
I be craving for that steak
Catch me on the eye
I be in and out of state
Money on my mind
It won't let a nigga think
Ain't tryna keep [?]
Known to keep faith
Keep that shit k
I be riding with the K
Throwing up the cake
I be showing up in foreigners
I be sliding base
Getting high [?]

[Verse 1]
Now I'm on the rock
Knock it out the park bitch
I be in the field like I'm playing for the Marlins
Base like Hilary
Polo down like Carlton
Moon-walking on that lean
I'm feeling like a martian
I just wet the 7 up
The kitchen smell like garlic
You should come and shop with me
Got it on the market
Showing up in foreigners
This is an Aston Martin
Came through in a goose
You'd think I'm going hunting
Flyer than a hawk
[?]
Plus I'm on a molly
Turn up with my dog
She be giving head
She be giving up that noggin
Bitch I get them dollas
Go and ask your mom and them

[Verse 2]
I be ten toes down like an empire
I will never turn down I'm a vampire
I get giggity with your girl call me Quagmire
For my niggas I'm gonna ride like a damn tire
Bonfire
On my partner [?] dreadlock
I'm on fire
Got that game in a headlock
Home run money major like the Red Sox

Got connect just like a Xbox
VVS diamonds sparkling in my damn watch
You can call me Flin Stone make her bed rock
Clean jaguar

Nigga I just made the bed rock
