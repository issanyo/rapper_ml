[Intro: Kodak Black]
Like you niggas ain't even doing shit
You niggas running around here
Talking about a nigga hating on you
But real shit though dog it's too much money out here to be hating

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Too much money out here

Got it back and threw it

[Verse 2: Plies]
Give you fuck nigga of the year award
Y'all hating I’m at the clearport
I already made the money
The cake been baked
I don't even know why you dissing for
Everyone know I got 16 cars
I don't even know why you tripping for
You already know I'm fucking your lady
I don't even know why you hit me for
I keep money in all four of my pockets
Fake real clean I don't award nobody
Where I keep the bag, I don't show nobody
Pill kicked in I got Xan in my body
I can buy a Bugatti now
I swear I'm a savage lil nigga, you know I don't care
I got so many clothes, don't know what I would wear
Only one way you supposed to hit bae and that's bare
Hoes fuck around like TMZ
All white on me like CMG
Everyday I'm lit like PNB
Got a Benz in the yard that's a AMG
Pick a nigga bitch on INT
Ball on your ass like CP3
Everyday know me, don't need a ID
You the police like TPD
