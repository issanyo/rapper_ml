Playing games witcha girl like what
Going on and off, like swerve, skrt, time to fill up
Feel like i been here before
Double edged sword, keep wanting more
Keep getting hurt oh, what you do that for
Blame it on you you can blame it on me
Its been a whole week vision blurrin can't see
Shame on me for anticipating
Need to let go, focus on me

1 2 3 , simple ass basic math in space
Day dreamin chasin'
Finna dip out this place when clock hit 4
Got a itch to create
This can't wait no more
Had to fumigate my space
U can't relate, droppin fakes like theres no escape
Can't dim my shine my money self made
Make no mistakes
Fresh green
Who dis
New plates

Play this on repeat that deja vu
You’ve change since i met you

You see me you see me
You see me me doin me like oh
So u start doing u like oh

Think of a way to communicate these feeling that I’m feeling cuz I’m glowing and just figured I’d be honest cause its autumn and I’m sown’ what I’m tryna see in my life ima watch life stock up like a rocket right through the sky like
Whoa uh ay yeah
