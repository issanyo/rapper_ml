[Intro]
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get for bein' real
Look what I get for bein' true
Look what I get
This what I get for lovin' you
This what I get for lovin' you
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' real
This what I get for bein' true
Look what I get for lovin' you
Look what I get

[Verse]
You got my number, so don't take it to the internet
I'm a real nigga, so I don't get in the net
Kill Bill, I be slidin' with the Killtec
I don't believe in karma, I ain't get killed yet
But I don't wanna die, I just wanna live
Real niggas don't die, we get on the pill
G'Pheral 'bout to come home on appeal
And they 'bout to offer fam another plea deal
I can't even S.I.P., can't smoke in peace
I can't even R.I.P., can't roll in peace
I don't rest in peace, bitch, I roll in peace
I can't even H.I.P., can't hoe in peace
I'm cheatin' on my baby, but I can't hoe in peace
I ain't lukewarm, bitch, I'm cold as heat
Ayy, fuck with me, I'm fuckin' loyal
Niggas kill you 'cause they love you, they want no remorse
How the fuck you put a baby on child support?
I'm married to the game, I don't want no divorce
I set a standard, then I stand on it
This what I get for bein' real, don't it?
This what I get for bein' real, do it?
And I ain't got no heart, so I don't feel Cupid
And I don't show no love 'cause I don't get in return
I don't show no love 'cause I don't get what I earn
I don't show no love 'cause I don't get what I deserve
Took my energy off the curb, put it on the verse
Now every time I say a word, cost a quarter bird
I'm rockin' pony hair boots, this is pony hair
I'm rockin' pony hair boots, this is real fur
And I be lookin' like a million every time I splurge
That's just what I get for bein' real to her
That what I get for bein' real to you
I stepped up out the game, had to step in the booth
I stepped right on a nigga, now I step in the booth
And trust me, I ain't ever need a vest for the proof
And I ain't had no choice of what you left me to do
You made me heartless
You made me heartless
You made me
You made me heartless

[Outro]
Look what I get
Look what I get for bein' loyal
Look what I get for bein' real
Look what I get for bein' true
Look what I get
