[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this
Ain't tryna be your alternate
Fuck it, you can stay with him
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
Why the hell you wanna stay with him?
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
You don't know what you could be
You ain't don't even know my pitch
Like you don't wanna be my bih
I'm tryna make you my bih
I don't wanna be your mini-er
Don't wanna be your inferior
If you give me a chance
Baby, I'ma be your man

[Verse 1]
Baby, I ain't even playin'
I just wanna be your man
Lately I been thinkin'
Wanna have some romance
I'ma treat you like a princess
Ain't gonna nowhere, I'm stayin'
Fuck them lil' hoes, they hatin'
Ain't gonna nowhere, I'm stayin'
Tired of this other nigga
I know he a lame
I would X him out the fuckin' picture
But you won't tell me his name
I'ma crop him out the frame
I'ma find out where he stay
I'ma get that nigga slayed
But you don't wanna tell me his name

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this
Ain't tryna be your alternate
Fuck it, you can stay with him
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
Why the hell you wanna stay with him?
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
You don't know what you could be
You ain't don't even know my pitch
Like you don't wanna be my bih
I'm tryna make you my bih
I don't wanna be your mini-er
Don't wanna be your inferior
If you give me a chance
Baby, I'ma be your man

[Verse 2]
You don't want me, then just tell me that
I swear to god I'll understand
Probably feel like I'm just a kid
I'm nineteen and you twenty-six
I'm infatuated with everything you do
But I'm tired of trying to impress you boo
So tell me what it is
And baby, I'ma let you live
Baby, I'ma let you be
Do you want him or you want me?
Swear I don't wanna be your secondary
Lil' Kodak crop him out the picture
Baby. you just don't know
I ain't even got no hoes
I just wanna be your only though
That's only if you want me to

[Chorus]
Fuck this shit, I'm tired of this
Ain't tryna be your alternate
Fuck it, you can stay with him
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
Why the hell you wanna stay with him?
Obviously you ain't shakin' him
I see that nigga, I'm slayin' him
You don't know what you could be
You ain't don't even know my pitch
Like you don't wanna be my bih
I'm tryna make you my bih
I don't wanna be your mini-er
Don't wanna be your inferior
If you give me a chance
Baby, I'ma be your man
