[Hook: KEVINBO202]
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me

[Verse 1: KEVINBO202]
How am I always surrounded but I feel so lonesome
In this home I feel so cold
It's more like I am frozen
My life is changing it's so strange and I know it just goes on
All these people know my name but no one really knows him
Changing like it is my job I just got a promotion
Moving on from those who passed on
I'm stuck in this motion
Stuck in this ditch it's such a bitch
Help me I am stuck in
Maybe i'll just end it all and drink all of this potion
People think that it's a joke this life that we are living
No ones laughing over here I am not a comedian
It's just the cards that we're dealt
The life that we are given
If you can't withstand the heat get the fuck out the kitchen!

[Hook: KEVINBO202]
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me

[Verse 2: KEVINBO202]
When they shot and killed you rich the bullet went right through me
Got the call in Ocean City Beach became so gloomy
I trust no one except this gun loaded in the UV
Now it's time for Dinner Talk so come and meet the new me

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Hook: KEVINBO202]
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me
Everyday I'm growing colder i'm becoming lonely
People reminiscing wondering about the old me
I gave a girl my gun and then I told that bitch to blow me
They're screaming Kev Bo, Kev Bo
But these people do not know me

[Outro: KEVINBO202]
These people Do Not Know Me
These people Do Not Know Me
These People
These people Do Not Know Me
These people Do Not Know Me
