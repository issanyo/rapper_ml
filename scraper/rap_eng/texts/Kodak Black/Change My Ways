[Intro]
Dawg, I swear dawg
It's like I, like I got a whole 'nother soul and shit
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby

[Verse 1]
I got my grandma a mansion in Haiti
I feel like we still be goin' through slavery
I need to cool it off all of these drugs
I be to quick reachin' out for my gun
I hope my son don't turn out to a thug
I know that gangster shit run in his blood
My baby mama keep listenin' to punks
They tellin' her to go after my funds
They hate that people be showing me love
I got more money then any of 'em, I'm young
Harriet Tubman, I'm still on the run
I'm thinkin' 'bout all of the shit that I done
I'm tryna cover my dirt
I put in so much work
Sniper Gang, this ain't a business
Sniper Gang, this how I'm living
I need to change how I'm living
I think I'm way too committed
When I ain't thuggin' I miss it
My trigger finger be itching

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby

[Verse 2]
I think I'm losing my conscience
I pray to god that I find it
I used to pop too much mollies
I think it fucked up my noggin
All I be thinkin' about it
I need to stay out the projects
'Cause all of my niggas be wylin'
I don't know where I'd be without it
How I'ma stay out the projects?
When that's where I got all my knowledge
Remember we used to be robbin'
But now he don't like how I'm striving
No Bud, I ain't drinkin' no beer
Every day I'm getting wiser
I'm happy I got away solid
E picked me up when I shot him
I had to ditch all the sliders
I need to change my surroundings
I'm tryna be a lil calmer
I can't go back to the bottom

[Chorus]
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change the lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
I need a baby to keep me sedated
I need to change my lil ways I be thinkin'
I can't keep runnin' my people, I'm crazy
I can't keep goin' to jail, that's fugazi
Ain't no more fraud, now I'm legally bankin'
Nevada won't even accept me in Vegas
You can't keep runnin' 'round here like you made it
That was an accident, you got my baby
