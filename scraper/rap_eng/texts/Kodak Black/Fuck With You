[Intro: Kodak Black]
Be what you wanna be
This love right here stings
She yellow like Bumble Bee
Yah Yah

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I think I might wife that girl, I might buy her a ring
I'm talkin' 'bout off white fur, that's somethin' up my sleeve
I don't wanna watch you leave me, I don't wanna see you go
I'd rather them poke my eyes out than to see you go
I don't wanna watch you leave, bae I wanna plant a seed
Baby I sold you weed, baby we could grow a tree
I ain't ever chase no bitch, but, baby, I'ma chase my dreams
'Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see you in my dreams
I'll even let you use me, baby if you wanna use me
I don't care what you doin, I'ma support your movement
They call me stupid, so? Know what I'm doin' though
Don't care that she a hoe, wanna be with this hoe

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tory
I can make you feel something, shorty, make you feel somethin'
You can pull up on a nigga when you wanna feel somethin'
You can pull up on a nigga just to keep it real or somethin'
Chill or somethin', spend time with a nigga and you keep it trill or somethin', yeah
Shawty there make my head change, I'ma put her in a red Range
She was there when the feds came, fuck her and I made her hair swing
Pull up on her in a new Vs, with the 2-3s and my Gucci
Beat the pussy right up out the bed frame
That shit is good, that shit is mine, yeah
That was your broad, that was your tape, but you a facade, yeah
Switch it up and let it fall, yeah, I never stall, yeah
She hella pretty with the blonde hair, I'm tryna get it for the long year

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee
Hope you fuckin' wit' me, girl I fuck with you
With me in one of these cities, but do what you wanna do
But be what you wanna be, you make my summer breeze
This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble Bee
