[Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me

[Verse 1]
I'm a dog, here to beat the rabies
I talk before I walk, Yeah project baby
Tote up them 80's, it ain't got no safety
Put down my statement, cause I was stripping naked
Goddamn the beat just stopped I guess the beat is Satan too
And no I'm not no dancer, but a youngin' making moves
If they say money talk, I got so much to say to you
Your soldiers marching up on me, no it's April fools
I ain't coughing but I'm sipping cough syrup
And yeah my car is candy painted, nigga starburst
I'm blowing louder, so keep it down as earth
This molly got me dazey, I ain't talking flowers

[Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me

[Verse 2]
I'm superfragiespadileKodak
I'm wonderin' if they watchin me, on my rollex
?????????????????
Run up on me, with your legs
I pass that dope like a test
Five shots go tween your ol' head
God I'm stupid rich
Got a stupid whip
I'm a lunatic
Foolishness
Please get out my face, you a bougie bitch
I'm the shit
Kodak, I just jumped up out the sewer bih
True to this
Rockin' shoes and shit, Fuck that jewelry
I'm moving slow
I just poured a four, I'm bout to overdose
Stupid flow
Nigga don't know you know, I'm not no average joe
Strike the pole
I will strike your hoe, like a lightning bolt
Panty loafs, on me
Now she lick me like an envelope

[Hook]
Lord, I be on the molly
I be rollin' hard
Man I'm up all night I can't sleep
I be on that dope
All I smoke is loud
Got me looking like I can't see
I be on that lean
On them xanny bars
Got a youngin' feelin' lazy
They know I'm a star
Steady switching cars
I know why these niggas hate me
