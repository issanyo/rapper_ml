[Intro]
I like drowning
Hell yeah, I like drowning
Mm-hmm
I like swimmin' in that lil' ocean
Mm-hmm
Real shit
You too
Glee
You act like you gon' drown me

[Chorus]
Every time you see me, boy, I got that Kel-Tec tucked
You don't even know how I got it on me
Every time I'm fuckin' on lil' shawty, she remind me of that dope
'Cause that shit be like macaroni
I ain't Milly but I'm rockin' in here
They done let me bring my Glock up in here
I ain't Nelly but it hot up in here
I let out thirty shots up in here

[Verse 1]
I make that pussy feelin' like it's mac n' cheese
Like Dwyane Wade, I be packin' heat
Got a toy with a whole thirty clip in in it
I fuck with Reckless, that my nigga 'cause he authentic
Got lil Rex on the beat and I am not friendly
I get stupid on a nigga, like I'm autistic
Ain't do the show without my tooly, I ain't finna do it
Every time you see me out, I be fuckin' booted
I wanna shoot that nigga, E-Pimp told me not to do it
Haitian boy blue stripes I ain't fuckin' Rudy
My lil' homie, he a fool, he quick to go to shootin'
I say the Draco got a drum, you think I'm makin' music

[Chorus]
Every time you see me, boy, I got that Kel-Tec tucked
You don't even know how I got it on me
Every time I'm fuckin' on lil' shawty, she remind me of that dope
'Cause that shit be like macaroni
I ain't Milly but I'm rockin' in here
They done let me bring my Glock up in here
I ain't Nelly but it hot up in here
I let out thirty shots up in here

[Verse 2]
Ayy-Bay-Bay, captain jumpin' out the Wraith
With the K, like I ain't got nothin' goin'
Like I ain't got a fan base, like I don't be performin'
Like I ain't got a lot of fans, like I don't be tourin'
They don't let me bring my wooly in the venue
If I can't find your home boy, then I'm hittin' you
Baby girl, that pussy wetter than chicken noodle soup
Baby girl, that pussy sound like ramen noodle soup
That pussy soundin' like we're stirrin' up some gumbo
All my niggas Sniper Gang, they go retund-to
Got too much felonies, I can't never go to Toronto
I fuck with Petho, fuck with Yoshi, fuck with Monto

[Chorus]
Every time you see me, boy, I got that Kel-Tec tucked
You don't even know how I got it on me
Every time I'm fuckin' on lil' shawty, she remind me of that dope
'Cause that shit be like macaroni
I ain't Milly but I'm rockin' in here
They done let me bring my Glock up in here
I ain't Nelly but it hot up in here
I let out thirty shots up in here
