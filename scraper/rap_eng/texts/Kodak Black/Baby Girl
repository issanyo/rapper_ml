[Hook]
I'm so tired of people telling you i'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time i hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like i'm feeling you more each and everyday
I ain't letting you go don't you run away

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
Its like i'm feeling you more and more everyday
I'm asking god is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake i call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy toes like she balleray
She heard i'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say i'm acting strange
Red bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride
