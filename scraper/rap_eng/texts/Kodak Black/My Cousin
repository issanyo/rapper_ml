[Intro]
My cousin just text me and shit (Yeah Free BG, rest in peace [?])
He said, "I just got wet up sitting in my car this morning Cuzzo
I got hit one time but I'm good though (free all my Sniper Gang niggas), just letting you know before these niggas kill me
I love you to death and forever. Let me live on as a real sniper

[Chorus]
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

[Verse 1]
I'm in the studio right now, I'm on album mode
I wanna get suited up and tooted up on sniper mode
Every time a nigga get focused, it be some fuck shit
It throw me off my pivot and make me get on my thug shit
Last year my cousin got hit up and got kidnapped
I wasn't even there but you know a nigga handle that
Hit him up again this year and I ain't feeling that
I'm throwed right now cause I don't know where my feelings at
I don't know if I wanna rap or want to pop a cap
But I know you niggas want to see me go right back
But this sniper gang shit in me, I'm living like that
You niggas about to make me relapse, I'm feeling like that

[Chorus]
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though

[Verse 2]
Soldier-like mentality, going through these tragedies
Don't wanna see me happily, rather see me raggedy
They don't wanna see me get a bag, they wanna bag a G
But I go on a clappin' spree and murk ya whole family
I guess a nigga kept it too real, that's why they mad at me
Sitting back thinking right now, I'm smoking Grabba Leaf
Nigga went from wearing baggy jeans to dressing casually
From being on the newspapers, now I'm on magazines
I'm chopping it up with Master P, told me keep God first
We doing venues now, selling out concerts
I'm trying to keep a tunnel vision, trying to see it his way
But I got blood in my eyes, I'm tired of seeing this way
I can't even sleep skraight, even on the Tempurpedic
Why I'm still going through it? Why I'm still fighting demons?
Niggas call you pussy when you focused and avoiding shit
We getting this money for no reason, nigga trying to enjoy this shit
I got a lil' boy and shit, and I don't wanna leave dude
Cause they'll trick him like they did me, that's what these skreets do
Niggas out here playing gangsta and playing police too
I seen the paperwork and that's why they don't kick it like we do
That's the same reason you couldn't come home to seafood
Been moving funny but a nigga just couldn't read you
Beat was been over with, looped it cause I love this beat
Looting for my cousin and my niggas who in custody
I'm feeling like its my fault, feel like it's because of me
Was tryna soak the industry, I already thugged the streets
Did my thing a couple nights, I already earned my stripes
Deeper than rap, they fucking with me cause I'm about that life
You know I'm head first, Big Cuz, that's why you called me man
But if I go to jail again, my mama she gone wash her hands
I'm innovating how to play it but it's still a slim chance
Cause you will sink in the sand in the game without a plan

[Outro]
Aye I swear to God cuz when you called me dog
And you told me that shit dog I said fuck everything
House arrest whatever, you know what I'm saying? I went to looking for my AR I couldn't find it you know what I'm saying
You know I fuck with them AR's and shit
Dracos too heavy and shit
Draco's get too hot
That AR got the coolin' center, the heat sensor, know what I'm saying with the scope with the crosshair
And shit I guess it wasn't meant, dog
