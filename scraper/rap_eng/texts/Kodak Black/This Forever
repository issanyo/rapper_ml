[Intro]
Glee, gleeful
Yeah, like a nigga water whip
Glee

[Chorus]
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin’
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin’, I'm like this forever
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin'
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin', I'm like this forever

[Verse 1]
You know me, bih, I’m Lil Kodak, get a nigga sniped
I will never stop thuggin’, I'm like this for life
I be gettin’ to the cheese, but I don't fuck with mice
Nigga rattin' on the team, hope them niggas die
When that four pound rock, I make the block shake
Glock like alarm clock, I make the block wake
I still can't believe Twin told on Jack
But I fuck with  Michelan’, but his brother rat
I ain't go to class, stackin' paper like it's loose leaf
I've been totin' straps, ugly corner too creep
All love fake, what you think the name mean?
I'm layin' on you like a snake, bitch, I'm A-Team

[Chorus]
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin'
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin', I'm like this forever
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin'
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin', I'm like this forever

[Verse 2]
They wanna see the day I turn a rapper nigga
Let this money make me soft so they can bash a nigga
Like a nigga water whip, I'm comin' back hard
With the same vibe when I used to jack cars
How I boot up on these niggas, ain't got no remorse
I'm droppin' knowledge on you young niggas, no charge
And a nigga still thuggin' with this Prada on
Hundred thousand dollar watch, you know what time I'm on
I be lookin' in the mirror, I'm a fuckin' G
I done came from the street, this how I wanna be
My street cred' on fleek and I'm still intact
This how I am, this how I was, this how I'm finna act

[Chorus]
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin'
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin', I'm like this forever
Like a nigga water whip, I'ma get it crackin'
Cut from a different cloth, I'm a different fabric
They wanna see the day that I go polyester
I ain't never stop thuggin', I'm like this forever
