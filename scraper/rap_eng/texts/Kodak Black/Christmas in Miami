[Intro]
Ayy, I don't know if I wanna call this detox ’cause I'm like... I'm puttin’ away a lot of old shit just so I can be with this one individual, but at the same time, all I really want for Christmas is her

[Verse 1]
I put the Glizzys down so I could be with you
I put the Remy down, I don't want no more of this juice, yeah
I put the Henny down, I'ma throw away the Goose, yeah
'Cause I be showin' out, another side of truth, yeah
India, I had loved you like you mine, babe
You was runnin' all through my head, you gave me migraines, mmm
I cannot lie and say that I'm fine
Took another sip to write this rhyme, ooh
I cannot lie and say that I'm fine
Took another bitch to ease my mind, ayy

[Chorus]
Now I’ma spend my Christmas in Miami
I’ma be in Miami, I'ma be in Mi—

[Verse 2]
I’m from Broward, but my lady from Miami
I'ma hit her with no Jim Beam, show her to my family
They so curious, but we not into y'all
She say, "Period," I be like, "Periodt"
She can have any nigga, I can get like any broad
She don't be milkin’ me, but she be milkin' y'all
I know you prolly dealt with a few celebrities
But I don't even care, I need you next to me
Can you see the best of me? Want you to marry me?
Would you say yes to me? Want you to marry me this year
Even get down on my knees, pull out that carat ring
And don't embarrass me, want you to marry me this year
Am I movin' too fast? 'Cause I'll slow it down
You the only reason I felt like puttin' down my four pound
You the only reason I ain't runnin' 'round with them hunnid rounds
Slidin' 'round in an opp's town, you the only reason I ain't locked down
I just wanna love you, baby, just don't make no fool of me
I know on your birthday I ain't gotta buy you jewelry
I know on your birthday I ain't gotta splurge you
Just because it's Christmas, you don't need a Birkin
And you all I want for Christmas
You all I want for Christmas
You all I want for Christmas (It's you, love)

[Outro]
It's you
It's you
I know it, I know it's you
