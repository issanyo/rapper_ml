[Intro]
Rippa on the beat, bitch
Fresh out of jail, but don't think I'm scared to go back, motherfucker
I still'll hit a nigga with that glizzy
If rap don't pop, I'm back to stealin' identity, I'm back to credit card theft
Back to credit card fraud
Fresh out of jail and Atlantic Records dropped that bag on me
Yeah, them crackers just dropped that bag on me again
Let me hear it

[Chorus]
Fresh out of jail, made another milli'
And bitch, don't think I changed, 'cause I didn't
I'll still'll hit a nigga with that glizzy
If rap don't pop, I'm back to stealin' identity
Credit card fraud, I'm in an Infiniti
I just took my brother's charge like I am not rich
I took my brother's charge like I ain't got shit
I guess he ain't step up for me 'cause he ain't got it in him

[Verse]
I'm walkin' 'round with fifty thousand in my denim
And I don't trust nobody, I'm drinkin' snake venom
And I don't like you nigga, man, I'm just sayin'
I don't really like you bitches, I be just playin'
Before I jumped up off the porch, I was ready then
Let's see if I can shoot the pistol with my left hand
Type of nigga hit the party with my FN
Type of nigga fuck a shawty and her best friend
I be gettin' to the loot, I be gettin' it in
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can
Road runnin', gettin' money, I be pullin' scams
Redrum, head huntin', nigga, what you sayin'?
If you fuck with me, then why you got me doin' time?
If you fuck with me, then why you got me slangin' iron?
All these bitches on my dick, but they can't even ride
Got my mama out the bricks, she ain't gotta cry
Ayy, don't be fuckin' with my clique if you ain't tryna die
I'm a Zoe, don't call me Slime, then you is not my kind
I be steppin' on these niggas, I don't rest up
I put my foot down on that bitch, she be like, "Yes sir"
Free my nigga JGreen, took one for the team
Hit the bank, I want no dubs, don't even
Kodak Black, I don't fuck with cuz, cuz green
Hit the slab, go and run it up, you know what I mean

[Bridge]
You know what I mean? You know what I'm sayin'?
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can
You know what I mean? You know what I'm sayin'?
Free my niggas eatin' soup 'cause they in the can

[Chorus]
Fresh out of jail, made another milli'
And bitch, don't think I changed, 'cause I didn't
I'll still'll hit a nigga with that glizzy
If rap don't pop, I'm back to stealin' identity
Credit card fraud, I'm in an Infiniti
Yeah, I just called Chief, he said that's not it
You keep tweetin' 'bout a nigga, get your block hit
I guess he ain't fuckin' with me 'cause I ain't fuckin' with him
