[Intro]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Kodak Black, I'm the truth man
This another one

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box
Grab them one for ones and end up goin' double par
You would think a nigga homeless, man he stay on the block
Remember we were homeless, man I stay tryna plot
I was going up top and hiding pieces in my socks
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch
Had to quit half steppin', had to give it all I got

[Verse 1]
Fuck the FPL, bitch we buckin' all the power
I been doing well since I bumped into that power
Yeah them niggas straight, but ain't no nigga like a nigga from Broward
Running out of mollies so I laced her up with powder
Young nigga, I just wanna lay low and chill
Hoe don't call me Kodak thought I told you call me Bill
You know a nigga clutching got to keep that thang concealed
Nigga what's the point of doing it if you ain't gon do that shit for real?
Damn man, I thought Ian Rapport keep it real
Used to fuck with Carlo 'till he showed me what it is
Can't believe Dieuson, looked up to him when I was lil
I ain't even shocked, kinda expected that shit from Khalil

[Hook]
In my own bubble nigga, I had to clear my circle up
Cause wasn't nobody with me when I was piped out in the box

I was going up top and hiding pieces in my sock
Find another route, and I turned it up a notch

[Verse 2]
Best believe let it sit too long and it's gon' rot
I seen it comin', once you leave your home we in ya spot
I'm in school, I got a glue stick, filled it up with rock
If I up it, I'mma shoot it, 40 with a cock
40 with a dick, yeah, extendo on my Glock
Cash for gold I use to catch a city bus way to the swap
I done growed up, young nigga 18
Mondo let me hold a 9 and that shit there got a beam
Went on a lil mission by myself, only me
Niggas tryna intervene, come between a nigga dream
Lil JackBoy he just call me I'm like "What's up, what you need?"
Even though he straight, I still sent him something for canteen
