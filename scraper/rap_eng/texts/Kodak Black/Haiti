[Verse 1 - Kodak Black]
Look, I'mma take a nigga to Haiti
And I'mma stop by the woo lady
When I jump up in the coupe I go crazy

Yea I act how I want cuz I made it (Yup, Yup)
If my nigga rock I'mma roll ya (Yup, Yup)
She ain't never been wit a zoe (Oh, Oh)

You ain't from the Ugly Corner so don't go there
Rock and roll if you with me we gon roll ya
Rock and Roll shit I'm fucking up the hotel

She say she fell in love wit me baby oh well

[Chorus]
I'm a Rolling Stone would ya roll along

Papi gained a bowl, watch me overflow
