[Intro]
Aye
Love just like death, dawg, it change everything
Money, too
You know I remember going shopping, dawg, without money
And I seen everything I wanted
Now I get all this money, dawg, I go to the mall
I won't see nothing I want
I got everything
You too, my nigga, you hatin', too

[Chorus]
First Choo Choo and now you, nigga?
All the hate y'all revealing way overdue, nigga
Ain't gonna lie, I was fooled, thought you was true niggas
I keep real niggas only in my crew, nigga
And none of this money ain't ever new, nigga
But my niggas changed, left me with new niggas
They testin' a kid, I went to school wit' 'em
I'm hangin' with crackers, hangin' with Jew niggas
You wanted a little fame, here it is then

[Verse]
Droppin' hits pussy nigga, I'm a veteran
Still droppin' hits in a Dodge Caravan
I'm smokin' on a pen, I will never land
I'm drinkin' on this Hen', got me arrogant
I'm higher than a bitch, I'm in the air again
And I got the tool up in the Caravan
And I set the stu' up in the Caravan
How I'm 'posed act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
How I'm 'posed to act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
Niggas better shoot me where I stand, 'cause I ain't runnin'
Ain't no nigga gonna shoot me anyway, not even a dummy
How I'm 'posed to act when a lil' nigga found money?
I lost all my niggas when a nigga found money
My nigga in prison he just called me on the phone
He said that them niggas heard about him in my song
Now they 'bout to X him out because I said he told
And if I ain't save his life, that nigga would've been gone
Even though he snitched I told 'em not to do him wrong
Niggas sneak diss then they go to calling my phone
'Cause all I care 'bout: my kids, I don't care 'bout my future
Nigga if you diss, nigga I'm gon' shoot ya
Nigga if you run up on me, nigga I'ma buss
Nigga if you run up on me I'ma- blood
I'm gon' shed blood
I'm gon' need bloodshed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm gon' need a whole head
And I ain't pay a nigga 6 bands to touch you, boy
My niggas ain't even worried about the money, boy
My niggas do it 'cause they love the boy
And now I do it for free I don't need no reward
And now I do it, just me, I don't need no support
And I don't play basketball, so I ain't goin' to court
See em when you see me we be like a pair
She love me to pieces, I love her to death
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the Devil
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the metal
She love me forever, she made me a lil better
She fly just like my sweater, I never forget her
I'm turnt up in the air, I be on the pill
I took off on a pill, I be in the air
Push a nigga head back, cut his hair
Snatch her lace wig off, she ain't got no hair
Know my momma good and my brother doing great
And my son good
God fucked around and saved me
I'm smilin' with the glizzy tucked
Bitch look like I'm whippin' up
Wrist look like a million bucks
But it's just a quarter mill
If I didn't like you then, I don't like you still
I'm smokin' weed now, I stopped poppin' pills
Diamonds on my ear just so I could hear
She love me to pieces, I love her to death

[Chorus]
Damn, first Choo Choo and now you, nigga?
All the hate y'all revealing way overdue, nigga
Ain't gonna lie, I was fooled, thought y'all was true niggas
I keep real niggas only in my crew, nigga
And none of this money ain't ever new, nigga
But my niggas changed, left me with new niggas
They testin' a kid, I went to school wit' 'em
I'm hangin' with crackers, hangin' with Jew niggas
You wanted a little fame, here it is then

[Outro]
Bang bang, here it is then
Put you on a shirt, here it is then
Niggas getting murked, here it is then
You niggas want a verse, here it is then
All you wanted was a verse, here it is then
But you fucked around and got murked here it is
