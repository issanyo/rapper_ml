[Hook: Jack Boy]
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I stack that money like it's wonder bread
Lately I don't even fuck her I just get some head
Catch me around with that fire make your momma cry
I'm getting to the point where I don't even gotta try
She said I'm too fly I'm that fucking guy
I be getting to that money , you just getting by
I was seventeen big .357
If a nigga try me imma send that boy to hell
Knick knack paddy wack, I gave my dog a bone
I'm blowing cantaloupe it put me in the zone
I'm higher than a bih feel like a fucking drone
I'm in love with money I can't leave it lone
She like how I swag on they ass
Young nigga getting to that bag , on they ass
Whips come from Germany she see no hoe hurting it
I'm sliding with that burner gotta keep it for emergencies
My young niggas pulled up and they poured up
I can open up shop and had the streets sold out
Down all my life but I been on for a minute
One thing about a nigga is I know how to go and get it

[Hook: Jack Boy]
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it

[Verse 2: Jack Boy]
Street , gotta bankroll
I'm in the projects where you can't go
Know I'm too fly with it
Fucked your hoe I ain't even gotta try to hit it
I ain't even gotta flex
Bitch I gotta check
Playing niggas like chess
One false move then Lil Jackboy at your neck
Running with techs like I'm beefin' with the ref
Played the game dirty got it out the mud
Used to hate me but now it's all love
I don't want to take no pictures in no club
Used to hate me so it's no love

[Hook: Jack Boy]
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it
She said I'm too fly with it
Getting to the point I ain't got to try with it
Weapon on my hip, love to ride with it
Stack the money like I'm about to die with it
