[Intro]
Baby girl I got 3 dicks
Fuck with me, I got 3 dicks
30 bitches, I got 30 clips

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
16 I open shop, then the people kicked us out

[Verse 1]
I ain’t with that shit, I swear to god
I’m on that shit, I swear to god
And really this a 40
But my 40 hold 30
Met a cougar bitch, she 30
She heard a nigga putting that work in
Ho I’m just sliding, I ain’t serving
I be gliding, I be swerving

[Pre-Hook]
Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
16 I open shop, then the people kicked us out

[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to my grandpa, he had 30 jits
I’m not a killer, but where the beat? I wanna murder it
This a drought, it ain’t no work, this shit been working bih
So I’m lurkin’ bih, I’m ‘bout to go on a burglary
Them people playing at my bank, they think I’m doing scams
Nigga drop the 28, he lost seven grams
Blackin’ P’s every day like I'm Will.i.am
Heard you niggas was looking for me well here I am!

[Pre-Hook]
Keep these niggas out my face, so concerning
I be sniping and deserting
Skrt skrt, I be leaning when I’m turning
All my pieces working, got me splurging

[Hook]
I got 30 inches on my car, I just made 30 drops
30 shots in my Glock, 30 golds in my mouth
You can call me leprechaun, throw the gold in the pot
Dish soap in the pot, 30 bands for a drop
Need somewhere to hide that guap, think I need another spot
30 down, straight drop, dirty tan, get rocked
Love the way that 30 pop, Stephen Curry with the shot
