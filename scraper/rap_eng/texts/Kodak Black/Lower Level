[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
I feel up, but I feel grounded at the same time
Hey, free them guys though
Hey

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)
It pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)
I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)
The next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)
I wanna see you do more better
Remember we slept on the floor together (Where?)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)
I-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em
(I don't know how long you got
I don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)
Remember we slept on the floor together (Word)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)
(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)
The gutter, the bottom (Lower level)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
They money never changed me (Nope)
It changed my situation (I just changed for the better)
Got niggas in the hood, can't leave the state of Tennessee (Why?)
They on probation (Papers)
Word of mouth got you picked up
No evidence in that room (What?)
They gon' try to break you (Shh)
Stay silent, don't fold
They can't do shit but hold you (Under)
72 hour investigation (That's it)
'Member all the times I was robbin' just to come up (Come up)
Lookin' for a lick late night 'til the sun up (Remember)
Sippin' 'Tuss straight out the bottle, put the cup up (Yellow)
Thinkin' 'bout your fuck-ups while you light the blunt up
She barely wanted you back when you had payments
Pink slip now, but your cars was rented
Got booked with a record, I ain't talkin' 'bout Guinness
She gon' fuck the next nigga when you get sentenced (Damn)
I can't forget where I came from (Came from)
It's to the point where the pain numb (Can't feel)
Lost his dog while incarcerated
Got to hear 'bout the funeral, can't come (What it do?)
They broke him down to the lowest level (Lowest level)
He gotta live with it forever (Forever)
Closin' your eyes, it ain't no better (Why?)
Visualizin' all the time together (Damn)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)
It pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)
I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)
The next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)
I wanna see you do more better
Remember we slept on the floor together (Where?)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level
I-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em
(I don't know how long you got
I don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)
Remember we slept on the floor together (Where?)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)
(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)
The gutter, the bottom (The gutter, the bottom)

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
All gas nigga, all powder
Sippin' lean, I'm on a new level
Poppin' beans, I'm tryna do better
Fuckin' bitches like I'm Hugh Hefner
Platinum teeth 'cause I'm a Platinum artist
I can't be humble, I'm hungry
I can't be fuckin' with homie
I can't keep clutchin' this .40
I used to run in them stores, go ask the people, they know it
I used to kick in them doors, nigga better give me my glory
We used to sleep on the floor, now you don't love me no more
I done been broke before, I done been in the rain
Ridin' 'round spendin' and things, now I'm in Fendi and things
Got me on Xannies and things, all I be feelin' is pain
It make me go to a place, it make me go to a spot
That I ain't never forgot
I was piped down in the box, you already know what I'm about

[Verse 3: Moneybagg Yo]
(Hey)
Beat the odds, they was all against me
Hard to separate fake when they all friendly
I'm in tune with reality (Yeah)
So I never let myself get caught up in it (Nope)
Perceivin' new haters knowin' that's comin' with it
Be your own charge partner, nigga fuck a codefendant
Seem like it come and find you when you tryin' to prevent it
Same dude body dropped, prayed 'bout it, I'll repent it
It 'posed to be us back to back in them Bentleys
Instead, I'm in court seein' you behind the benches
(One thing for sure)
Your kids and them good, Mama out the hood
You all that's missin' (Free you)
You bein' in the can wasn't in the plan
From them talks in the kitcken (Old talks)
I wish I could buy the jail, set 'em all free
Fuck it, tear down the fences (Free my niggas)

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I take a sip from my oil, yellow ('Tussin)
It pulled me down to a lower level (Sunken)
I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em (Damn)
The next time we talk man, I'm gon' tell em (What?)
I wanna see you do more better
Remember we slept on the floor together (Where?)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level
I-I got some niggas on lower levels (Sunk with 'em)
Stuck in the system, Lord help 'em
(I don't know how long you got
I don't know what the lawyer doin' with that bullshit)
Remember we slept on the floor together (Where?)
The gutter, the bottom, lower level (What?)
(Makin' pallets and shit, eatin' Cup Noodles)
The gutter the bottom (Lower level)
