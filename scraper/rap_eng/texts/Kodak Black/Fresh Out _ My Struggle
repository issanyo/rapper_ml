[Intro]
I hit rock bottom
Thought I was never gon' come up bih
For real tho, thank you lord

[Verse]
Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined it
It lil Kodak Black, bitch come capture this
Ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
Cuz I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, totin' my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
That time I let you slide, Imma whoop your ass bitch
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Ay, where them yellow bones? I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put your hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said "I love you?", I was just on that Yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that shit
Fuck it I don't owe a nigga shit
I been outchea thuggin' since a jit
Remember when we was strugglin' in them prick
A nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwing rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothing change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road running, switching lanes
State to state, I'm breaking the bank
Went to BA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here taking chances everyday
Niggas out here wylin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smoking dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't working out but I be shaking weight
Now my lawyer hollering pay me
Cause I got court December 7th
