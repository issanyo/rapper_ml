[Intro]
Sniper
Kodak, and you know that
Golden one, she say I'm the chosen one
1800
Project baby

[Verse 1]
Punchline
Hit the beat with a hook
Fuck around bobbed and weaved
Then I hit em with a left
I was wearing wooden beads
Now I'm on the scene I got VVS on my neck
Watch me flex
Jailbird now I'm free
Spread my wings, now a younging flying in a jet
Running up on me that's like saying that you do not want your head
Oh shit, I am loaded
In my foreign on a pit, yeah I'm rollin'
I'm a sniper
Strike you, call it bowling
40 toting catch an opp, where you going?
Going nowhere like the air, Imma blow him
Imma wet em up, soak him
Imma float him
I'm with Koly
Oh shit, rocking Dolce wrist frozen
Going dumb, I make no sense

[Hook]
Project baby
I got baby bottles full of lean
Project baby
Molly's got me pissing in my dream
Project baby
When they hear lil Kodak name nigga brought the camera
Project baby
I'm shitting on em
Shitting on a nigga, where my pamper?

[Verse 2]
Hammer time
Bought Bill on the block with the (?)
Tryna build my money up and get a brick
Same night me and DJ (?) took them thangs and hit another lick
Got a foreign whip
I hit your city, kill the show tourist
Glock 23, jump like Jordan
Getting cake, you can't get no portion
Feed up, she's a eater
I'm a goner, so bruh you can keep her
40 pipe real scary sight
Jeepers creepers
Black nigga in a white whip call it zebra
Imma switch it up
Tinted up when I'm pulling up
Pull up on your block
Hit you up when I'm hitting up
Money low
Better pick it up, homie get it up
Living in a barn
Polo down nigga, Giddy up!

[Hook]
Project baby
I got baby bottles full of lean
Project baby
Molly's got me pissing in my dream
Project baby
When they hear lil Kodak name nigga brought the camera
Project baby
I'm shitting on em
Shitting on a nigga, where my pamper?

[Verse 3]
Winning time because I remember I was losing
Last place, they was laughing in my face
Finish line, don't cry
Turtle getting by, thought the rabbit won the race
Wait, he was drinking dollar shots
E&J now Rozay by the case
Sad, I remember digging in the piggy ass now the rats in the safe
Fuck the bank, I can save it
That's my lady
Mercedes, drive her crazy
Keep the squares out my circle fuck that shady shit
Money running
Fuck it, Imma chase it
He be faking it, he not doing what he say he did
Asian bitch and an alien
Fuck a basic bitch
Back it up, ain't no lacking up
Imma clap 'em up
I'm a goose if that nigga quack, I will wack a duck

[Hook]
Project baby
I got baby bottles full of lean
Project baby
Molly's got me pissing in my dream
Project baby
When they hear lil Kodak name nigga brought the camera
Project baby
I'm shitting on em
Shitting on a nigga, where my pamper?
