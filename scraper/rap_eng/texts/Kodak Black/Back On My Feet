[ Hook ]
They ain't really fuckin with me
They be showing fake love
They jus wanna turn up with me
They jus wanna hit the club
They ain't really with a nigga
They jus wanna smoke my weed
They jus wanna take a picture
They jus wanna drink my lean
I be on that money shit nigga this the money team
I be on that junky shit nigga Ima money fiend
I was locked up in Virginia cause I hit for 30 Gs
Once them crackas let me out
I got right back on my feet
I got right back on my feet
I got right back on my feet

[Verse One]
And I'm still finessing I be flexing nigga you know me
