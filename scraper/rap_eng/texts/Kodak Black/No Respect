[Intro]
That was...that was a couple years ago nigga
I was... bout mothafuckin' nine
This shit updated now
This shit.. this shit updated
This shit upgraded
You dont even know like... what type of time

[Chorus - Kodak Black]
Riding in pavement
Graduated
I ain't doing no more fading
Riding in a decoy
Laying on em put em in a vacant
(yeah, yeah) Fuck that smith and wesson
Now i got a tech
90's baby we ain't got no damn respect
SG put the nolia on the map
Yeah we put the nolia on  the map
I ain't tryna draw no attention, so dont run up on me tryna rap
Dont run up on me tryna scrap
Dont run up on me i got the strap
In my studio i got plaques
I dont wanna put you on yo back

[Verse - Kodak Black]
Everybody love lil yah, drank a whole fifth like saks
She just wanna drink a lil yak
Fuck it then i bring her on back
Imma fight first then grab the gat
I would never fight over in that
Stay down like below of the map
All my niggas foul like over the back
Hate make my heat go rat-tat-a-tat
Ain't no cheese for a raa-aa-aat
Hate to see my automatic cause it go tat-tat
Fully auto drum making beats with the black mack
Nigga you a duck, Aflac
Got ya boo sending nudes on snapchat
Nope that ain't my troop thats family
Everybody with me knew me since elementary

[Chorus - Kodak Black]
Riding in pavement
Graduated
I ain't doing no more fading
Riding in a decoy
Laying on em put em in a vacant
(yeah, yeah) Fuck that smith and wesson
Now i got a tech
90's baby we ain't got no damn respect
SG put the nolia on the map
Yeah we put the nolia on  the map
I ain't tryna draw no attention, so dont run up on me tryna rap
Dont run up on me tryna scrap
Dont run up on me i got the strap
In my studio i got plaques
I dont wanna put you on yo back
