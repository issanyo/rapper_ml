[Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

[Verse 1]
How you came up off of these DP-baggies?
How you get that jag I see you whipping out in traffic
That lil nigga so scrap call him lil scrappy
How you get more money than your damn daddy
Nigga how you fit that whole thing in your jacket
Me and Jackboy we be scheming we be carjacking
Looking for me, catch me creeping midnight with that ratchet
I just linked up with more wheezy in the back alley

[Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic

[Verse 2]
All this money I be making I can't even stash it
And them niggas they be hating and they wanna have it
You gonna' have to come and take it I won't let you have it
Niggas try to come and take it ima' let them have it
Grinding on my mommas porch with my brother mazny
Everybody wit me ready and they bout that action
Why you think they call me Kodak? 'cuz i stay flashing
Why you think nobody like you 'cuz you stay flagging
If i stay consistent with it I can buy an Aston
I got shawty booted up she giving me daffy
Power high fuckin with me, he makin me happy
I just bought a new strap, I'm ready to blast it
Everybody in here with me straight bop-whacking
I can make a millie in my reebok classics
I forgot to bring the poker but i brought the flathead
Bout to make the bands drop, straight pop magic


[Chorus]
I'm from the ugly corner where we do a nigga nasty
Everybody toting straps, everybody trapping
Jit just jump up off the porch now he making it happen
This for all my young niggas up the road snapping
Big wheels, big bills, big automatics
All a nigga wanna do is ball like the mavericks
I could get a Rolls Royce if i keep snapping
Dope boys, wrap the slabs in the plastic
