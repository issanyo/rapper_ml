( 1800, I'm a damn gunner, a fucking road runner, got a stick with a whole 100, nigga you don't wanna run up run up, u get done up
400, 4way but I'm 3way )

[Chorus]
I just wanna get that money (get that money)
I just wanna get that money, flip that money (flip that money)
I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)
I just wanna get that money (get that money)
I just wanna get that money, flip that money (flip that money)
I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)

[Verse 1]
I'm a young nigga, I just wanna live, I just wanna chill
Smoking loud in a foreign whip
Independent, I don't want a deal, I just want a mil
Plus I'm hungry, I just want a meal, I ain't eat yet
I been up all night, I ain't sleep yet, and I need rest
But my dreams I ain't reach yet
Project Baby playing with the sack, ain't playing recess
Boy I need the check
I just wanna ball til I fall, but I ain't trying to fall
Boy I want that money out the ass, out my fucking drawers
Where the money? Boy I want it all, better have it all for me
If I throw these 1's, shawty better take it off for me
Money talk, she be capping, that bitch love talk to me
Charles Barkley, and they say the Migos stole my beat, but that shit don't bother me
Cause I just wanna be and I just gotta be, and its K to the B
I been on my P's and Q's before I knew my A's and B's
I was failing at my school, but in these streets got A's and B's
I was late for all my classes, but in these streets faithfully
4th quarter that was me, last year I made the beat
So, you can't change the beat, I already made the beat

[Bridge]
I just wanna rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna sack up on em, rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna stack up on em (stack up on em)
Then hit the corner and bring the Jag out (Jag out)

[Verse 2]
Ray told me bring him back some gold, I pulled a bag out
Nigga you mothafuckin hero nigga, I'm a bad guy
Nigga me and you, cops and robbers, you a damn cop
You a damn lie, boy I seen you smoking damn flock
Make them bands drop, 22 karats in my damn mouth
I was 16, nigga we ain't have no damn house
Had to stand down, Lil Kodak Black, I'ma standout
And I'm out in public, disrespecting, smoking damn loud
Oh, oh, oh Kodak you is out yo damn mind
Think I been here before, I'm before my damn time
I will come and end you, I'm a fucking Vampire
Hammondville to [?], Pompano my Franchise

[Chorus]
I just wanna get that money (get that money)
I just wanna get that money, flip that money (flip that money)
I just wanna stack them hundreds (stack them hundreds)
I just wanna spaz out, cash out (cash out)
I just wanna rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna sack up on em, rack up on em (rack up on em)
I just wanna stack up on em (stack up on em)
Then hit the corner and bring the Jag out (Jag out)
