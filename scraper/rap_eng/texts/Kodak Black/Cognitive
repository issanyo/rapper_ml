[Verse 1]
I'm in a condominium, I'm just in it for a month
This is not a rental, this a stolo here, lil boy
In a new apartment, this is where I park my car
Got a few options, I just pick these hoes apart
I got snipers in my car
I be bitin', I don't bark
I just light, I just spark
Then I light it up and spark
If it come out in the light
It'll happen in the dark
Got the fire with me, lil boy
I can't wait to feel my heart
I be fightin' in the mornin'
I can't even feel my heart
Got that ice box on my heart
I can't even feel my heart
Positive, cognitive, ion feel nun

[Verse 2]
Ion need no novocaine for these slugs
Ion know why, but sometimes I feel numb
Hit the dentist, and put permanents in my gums
They say, "Kodak, you don't never show no love"
You ain't love me, nigga, before I made it
Said she love me, now I'm rich and famous
My lil cranium is updated
I ain't fightin' no more
I ainâ€™t the same no more, I graduated
