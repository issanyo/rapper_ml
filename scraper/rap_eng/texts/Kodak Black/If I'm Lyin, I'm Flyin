Glee

[Verse]
I can't let these niggas knock me off my pivot
God sat me down and talked to me, I listened
I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud
Me and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt
It hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25
I'm from the Noya, all I know is slang that iron

[Outro]
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
Just like I told you, if I'm lyin' then I'm flyin'
