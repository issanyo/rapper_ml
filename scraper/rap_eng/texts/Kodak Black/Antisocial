[Intro]
I'm antisocial, nigga get from round me
My momma say get from round me

[Hook]
I'm antisocial, get from round me
Tryna hit the top, don't try and down me
Four diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi
I'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee

[Verse 1]
Boy how much you talkin'?
Fuck it, hit me on my walkie-talkie
It lil' kodak and I'm ridin' like a Kawasaki
Man these niggas goofy, they be Mickey Mousin'
Runnin' with my tool like I'm buildin' houses
You wanna run up? Don't do it you won't make it out it
Turn a rock to dead presidents just like a mountain
Two door Audi, Kodak where you go it?
This right here? I got that bitch from what you call it
These hoes thirsty, line 'em up and call 'em a water fountain
Tryna direct for me, send me to the county
Same niggas say they love me, same niggas doubt me

[Hook]
I'm antisocial, get from round me
Tryna hit the top, don't try and down me
Four diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi
I'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee

[Verse 2]
They wonder how he
Stay designer Down
He from out of town, how the hell he run this town?
He be always flossin', pull up in the 'Rari
Oh my God, I'm sorry
Cracker do you pardon?
Had to jump before I flew, remember I was crawlin'
Took a dose of cough syrup, I ain't even coughin'
And I'm fly like Batman but my jeans Robin
Time is money, waste my time then it's gonna cost 'em
Fresh to death like Houdini jump right out the coffin
Oh, moon walk in 'em, higher than a martian
Gang activity, blood drippin' from my bottles
Fuck a pacifier, lean all in my baby bottle

[Hook]
I'm antisocial, get from round me
Tryna hit the top, don't try and down me
Four diamond rings on, I pull off in the Audi
I'm ballin' now, got more bucks than Milwaukee
