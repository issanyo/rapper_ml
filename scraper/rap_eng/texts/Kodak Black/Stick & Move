[Intro: Alcy, Kodak Black]
Dang, Kodak
Maneuverin', stickin' and movin'

[Hook: Alcy]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
When I get the pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Kodak get them pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move

[Verse 1: Alcy]
Watchin' how I move right with this tool
Plug hit me up, "come and get this fool"
Fifty pounds, pick and choose
I was headin' home, let me hit this shoe
I'm a real life, jigga-holic
Big bankroll on me, fuck a wallet (fuck a wallet)
I'm sippin lean, you be sippin', what you call it? (what you call it?)
A nigga clean, you be lookin' for his stylist (right, right)
Man, I'm dry like fingernail polish
High as hell boy, I'm feelin' like a pilot (damn)
Everybody tryna rap, where the talent?
You ain't got it boy, you shoulda went to college
I'm just being honest, I'm just being real
We the best, DJ Khaled
Tall fat nigga, why you couldn't stay solid? (dang)
Better let shots rain, someone got your chain
Bottom boy got away, all 'bout to say (dang)
I brought the lean back, do the rock-away
That codeine help a nigga operate
Straight outta Broward County, shoutout to Dr Dre
He paved the way, now a young nigga out the gate (I'm out the game)
Tell my shit been true
Let me calm down, let me hit this dubie
And me and Kodak in the vic just coolin'
Hit you with the stick, now he stick and movin'

[Hook: Alcy]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
When I get the pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Kodak get them pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
In the boo, jiggin' on the boot
Call me jigga boo
Free SooWoo, free J Green
This for me, this for Cool
See my homie, smokin' flocka
Damn my nigga, is it true?
Stick and move
Kodak, stick and move
Kodak, hit the news
We were poor, we had rusty forks (you had the silver spoon)
Totin' toys, nigga, I jumped out the porch (in middle school)
You a faggot boy, I put that .40 with a dick on you
You think that's your boy, but, if he go down he gon' snitch on you
I don't want her, she a eater
You can keep her, she the swoop
She for him, she for them
She for me, she for you
Skippin' school, out here grippin' a tool
Out here gettin' the loot
Drop the roof, I got your bitch in a coupe
Pull up and bend it on you (Kodak)

[Hook: Alcy]
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
When I get the pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
Kodak get them pounds, I'mma stick and move
Slide through your town, I'mma stick and move
Pack touchdown, I'mma stick and move
Stick and move, stick and move
