[Hook]
My Fendi belt is buckled where my pistol is
(My hip)
I gotta get it, bitches don't mean shit to me
(Fuck that bitch)
I failed history, now I'm making history
(Fuck that class)
Lil nigga got that bang, I feel like Hilary
(Wave the gat)
I don't think they hearing me
I jumped up in my coupe
I'm on a mystery
Wait, I don't think they feeling me
This the life of Kodak
It's a mystery

[Verse 1]
My life a mystery, I'm a scavenger
I ride all up on the beat, don't need no passenger
My girl from Africa (?)
I'm rolling Cali bud
I smoke extravagant
You niggas characters, I'm talking Dr. Seuss
I wear binoculars when I jump in my coupe
My belt cost more than you
I got more bells than school
No, I can't love you boo because that's not what I do!
Finessing like a fool, I keep a strap or two
Got nothing for you silly tricks but some rabbit food
These streets is serious
Yeah, I'm mysterious
My swag ridiculous Kodak, just get it up

I'm on a mystery
Wait, I don't think they feeling me
This the life of Kodak
It's a mystery

[Verse 2]
My nigga George, he acting monkey, call him curious
I jumped in my whip just like Fast and Furious
I'm rolling cannabis, I'm pouring activist
I'm finessing, taking trips, I live adventurous
Boy who you think you is
You think you is that nigga
Goddamn lil buddy broke
I should've just hit that nigga
I'm swimming in that money
Nigga cry a river
Who told her she a dime
She a fucking nickel
I killed the beat, ooh she gon' kill me back
I left them flow ass niggas
Got my money right
My swagger mean
But I ain't nothing nice
I'll headcrack a nigga like (?)
