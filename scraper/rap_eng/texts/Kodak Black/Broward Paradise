[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye look I'm a take it back a lil' piece
I'm still a young nigga, I'm still a jitter bug
I'm talkin' about way back when Clemon used to ride through the 'jects

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm slangin' K, yea I be dealin' shit and stealin' shit
Back in the day, I was a fool and I was ignorant
I'm not a killer, but my nigga they on that killer shit
I'm 'bout my skrilla, I be dealin' just like a dealership
I mean wit' that fire, but my lil' dawg he make your street rock
Rap don't pop, I'm in the kitchen whippin' heat rock
Back in the day, I'm talkin' Dickey with my Reebok
I'm on a jigga, and I'm swingin' like a seesaw
I hit the news, I hit the news, I hit the news again
My mama warned me, that's this was what the streets gonna do to me
I'm from the No, I go hit a lick on a dirtbike
Right on a stroll, the plug just fronted me a dirtbike

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 2: Jackboy]
Back in the days, I was on the Ugly Corner
Trynna stack a pretty penny late night sellin' zona
Graduated from the streets but I ain't got a diploma
Been a little soldier hittin' licks around the 'Nolia
In and out of stolen cars, ridin' with Lil' soya
Had the coke no cola makin' stretch with the soda
Be a soul jumped behind us hit the gas, crash the 'Yota
If JJ's phone calls, mama sayin' boy I told you
Back in the day, them hoes left me on my own
Pullin' 'em now, won't quit callin' my phone
Dawg all of these bitches, Lil' Jackboy just want his bone
Don't wanna fuck in the car, made her ass walk home

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

[Verse 3: John Wicks]
Back in the days, I was the runner, was the gunner man
Back in the days, you couldn't chill on the corner then
Back in the days, was one on ones, ain't no jumpin' in
Back in the days, my mama told me ain't no funny shit
Broke get a job, they helped the family cause we strugglin' yea
Back in the days, my mama told me get that money
So I stopped sellin' reefer
I'm kickin' doors and robbin' corner stores
I'm John Wicks baby, you know me I'll let that hammer go
Back in the days, I ain't have shit but now I'm stuntin' though
They wasn't fuckin' with me, but now today I got a ton of hoes
They lovin' my style, I'm Wick got mouth full of golds
No central air but now I'm iced out like a eskimo

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
