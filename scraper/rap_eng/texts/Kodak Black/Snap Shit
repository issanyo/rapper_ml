[Intro]
I hit rock bottom
Thought I was never gon' come up bih
For real though, thank you Lord

[Verse]
Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined this
It's Lil' Kodak Black, but bitch don't capture this
I ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
'Cause I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, tote my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
Last time I let you slide, I'ma whoop yo' ass for this
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Aye, where them yellow bones?
I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put yo' hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said "I love you", I was just on that yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that and shit
Fuck it, I don't owe a nigga shit
I been out here thuggin' since a jit
Remember we was strugglin' in the bricks
Nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwin' rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothin' change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road runnin', switchin' lanes
State to state, I'm breakin' the bank
Went to BOA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here takin' chances everyday
Niggas out here wildin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smokin' dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't workin' out but I be shakin' weight
Now my lawyer hollerin' "Pay me"
'Cause I got court December 7th
Just in case them crackers slay me
Girl I'ma come and get you pregnant
Just tell my baby boy his dad a legend
Just don't let him be like me, 'cause I don't learn my lesson
I was already a felon once they let me out my mama belly
Got a telly in my cell, I'm smokin' reggie with my celly
Yeah I'm young and reckless
I just stole a Lexus just to flex it
Hit the scene, still in full on Ree's and I ain't even sell it
I'm a street nigga after paper
I be snappin', I be scammin'
They used to call me Lil' Duffle cause I'm a young hustler
Nigga I bring that check in
Uh uh
I'm a lil' motherfucker, I'm fuckin' on ya mammy
Slidin' in a Infiniti
Down here, we call that bih a FinFin
Yeah, man they leaked my goddamn song and I wasn't even finished
Young nigga, I'm dufflin', yeah, I'm gettin' to them Benji's
Mind yo motherfuckin' business
Windows tinted, I think this my car
I think this shit rented
Windows tinted, I think this a new one
I think this a rental
Everything orange, I'm smokin' cantaloupe

[Outro]
Thank ya Lord
I swear I ain't never expected this before
I ain't shit, so why you sendin' me all these blessings?
Roadrunnin', tunnel vision, I been speedin' with no limit for it
But I ain't never thought that it could get this far
First they wanted me to win, I had all the support
But once I won, they don't love me no more
'Cause they wanted me to win, but they ain't want for me to get this far
They say "No, no I ain't mean for you to get that far"
Drop a nigga girlfriend off to school in a Jaguar
Drop a nigga bitch to work in a Jaguar
