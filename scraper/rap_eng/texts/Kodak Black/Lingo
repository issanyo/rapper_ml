[Chorus: Kodak Black]
She say she love my lingo, I gotta be from the streets
She knew that I was G code, she can tell I'm from the streets
Im snappin going beastmode everyday, I be on a beam
You ain't gotta take no picture everyday, you'll see me on the scene


[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Aye no cameras in here please, is too much action behind these scenes
They won't let me in this rap shit ion care cause they love me im these streets
I don't rap it 'less I mean it, I'm sleepin but im geekin, I'm outchea walking in my sleep, I'm on phantom with the lean
Bitch you ain't even listening what im saying, you just staring at my teeth
I swear I used to play with lasers as a kid, but now my strap got a beam

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
She say she love my lingo, I gotta be from the streets
She knew that I was G code, she can tell I'm from the streets
Im snappin going beastmode everyday, I be on a beam
You ain't gotta take no picture everyday, you'll see me on the scene


[Verse 2: Jack Boy]
You don't know what a nigga seen, from pulling capers to doing schemes
I'm really out here ten toes in these streets, you only thuggin on IG
In real life I'm a G, in real life I'm im the field with my Zs
Why the fuck would I want one hoe? They more fun by the three
Kick the door ain't have a key, extortin niggas make 'em pay a fee
I ain't worried bout no beef, draco with the drum now niggas off beat, I knock em off they ass

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
She say she love my lingo, I gotta be from the streets
She knew that I was G code, she can tell I'm from the streets
Im snappin going beastmode everyday, I be on a beam
You ain't gotta take no picture everyday, you'll see me on the scene


[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
Aye don't come back if you leavin, I'm a street nigga girl you need one
They need to free my cousin G1 Dedon, that money come right back like ping pong
She used to fucking with them peions, the streets need ya Kodak keep going
Boy that dope sold that money fold ion care, you ain't finna get no refund
Might ride the cutlass to my pre-prom, I just might fuck her with my rees on
That money talk im speaking creole, I lost my re-up shooting Ceelo

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
She say she love my lingo, I gotta be from the streets
She knew that I was G code, she can tell I'm from the streets
Im snappin going beastmode everyday, I be on a beam
You ain't gotta take no picture everyday, you'll see me on the scene
