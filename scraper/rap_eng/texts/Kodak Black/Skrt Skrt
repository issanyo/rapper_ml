[Hook] Kodak Black
Girl I'm done with you
Girl we done it's through (girl we done)
I hit that nigga for the work (I finessed his ass)
Stick and move, then I SKRT, SKRT, SKRT SKRT, SKRT (Ooh I'm gone)
What is up with you (what is up with you?)
I thought I said I'm done with you (I though I said it's over)
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too (I will fuck you over)
Sniper on the roof, he playing peek-a-boo (he will knock you over)
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT (I SKRT, SKRT)
Jump in that Jag, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
(Ooh Kodak SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT)
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT


[Verse 1]
Girl I'm done with you after all we've been
Through
My heart you ripped it apart loved you from the
Start
Look what I've become suffering from love down
Syndrome
I'm neglecting the truth all i do is sing when I'm in
The booth
Trying to restablish youth after killing myself
For you
Now it's SKRT SKRT even if that shit hurts love
Comes first
You're my soulmate but sometimes you're the one
I hate
Never appreciate the patience i gave you , you
Wishing you can grave me
I dare you see if you're brave enough I've had
Enough
Of this rough road feels like we losing touch your
Talks come in clutch
But sometimes i hate your guts i love you i just
Can't find the words
For the verse of the song it's SKRT SKRT i cried for my niggas
R.I. P. T-Shirts
Never liked Kodak but this is a sick track i can lay back
And listen in my maybach
You wanna cry just replay that SKRT SKRT


[Bridge] Kodak Black
Girl I'm done with you
Girl we done it's through (girl we done)
I hit that nigga for the work (I finessed his ass)
Stick and move, then I SKRT, SKRT, SKRT SKRT, SKRT (Ooh I'm gone)
What is up with you (what is up with you?)
I thought I said I'm done with you (I though I said it's over)
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too (I will fuck you over)
Sniper on the roof, he playing peek-a-boo (he will knock you over)
SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT (I SKRT, SKRT)
Jump in that Jag, SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
