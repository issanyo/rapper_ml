[Chorus]
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be sticking, I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be stickin', I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

[Verse 1]
I'm zooted in the Phantom so I'm cruisin'
On the way to your lil' lady, I might fuck her in the booty
Dropped the Cutlass out the sewer
Rockin' Gucci, this ain't Coogi
Nigga better stop goin' to suzy
Nigga, go get you a Cuban link
Pull up, make them bitches faint
I'm doin' what you niggas can't
I'll wet a nigga up, no paint
All of my niggas I'm with don't think
Youngest nigga in the game
I'm fourteen when I caught a case
I was fifteen with a thirty-eight
I was sixteen, went to Larry James
I'm coolin' but the block on fire
Scoop the 28 out the pot
None of my niggas ain't went to college
All of my niggas they out the projects
Drop the money, catch the body
Jimmy Neutron with the rocket
Fuck with me, you know I got it
I do it and won't talk about it

[Chorus]
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be sticking, I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be stickin', I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit

[Verse 2]
Run up if you stupid, come on
Clutchin' on that wooly, come on
I'm burnin' in the lootin' (ayy)
I'm fleein' and eludin'
Polo let me hold the Uzi
I just rented me a vert
I be playin' with that work
Remember playin' in the dirt
Call me Dora, it's in my backpack
Fuck that ho 'cause she a nat nat
I'm gon' always keep a clapback
I'm gon' always keep a gat
Give me head, I call it a snapback
I just drove up in a hatchback
Got them pounds, ain't talkin' hashtags
Boy, I'm workin' with that sack
Your old lady say you fool
I just ran off with your boo
Told me everythin' you say
She told me everythin' you do
Ayy, I'm playin' with that wool
I'm playin' with that tool
You fuckin' with my zoes
Like you playin' in a zoo, ayy

[Chorus]
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be sticking, I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit
I'm coolin' but I'm booted
I got thirty in my toolie
Your old lady want to screw me
I'm so smooth, don't need no lubricant
Kodak makin' movies
My lil homie, he a foolie
I be stickin', I be movin'
I'm the youngest nigga to do this shit
