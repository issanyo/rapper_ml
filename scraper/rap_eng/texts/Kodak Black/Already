[Hook: Kodak Black]
My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap baby I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks homie this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw I'm a ball like spaghetti
It's getting hot in here the block be hot no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly
