[Intro]
I be working hard
I be selling hard
I don't keep it in the house its in the backyard

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Riding in an old school but its new to me, jumping out I got on all my jewlery
Yeah them boys so strapped they some hooligan
I throw them racks they come right back like boomerang
Riding in a old school but its new to me
Jumping out I got on all my jewelry
Yeah them boys so strapped they some hooligans
I throw them racks they come right back like boomerang

[Verse 1: Humble Haitian]
Hey there boo, who are you?
You so sexy, you so fine, can you be my boo?
Close your eyes, tell me what you see?
Do you see me?
Do you see E?
Phone ranging off the hook it won't let me sleep
So I popped me a molly and get on my feet
I be working hard, I be selling hard
I don't keep it in the house its in the backyard
Momma said don't worry cause she got me
She in Haiti
I know she love me
I know she bury heavy candles by me
Little Mama said I be flexing on my IG
Sim simmer let me get my keys
I'm on my road to riches, want to come with me?
Lately I've been feeling like the dope game meant for me
I'm steady whipping in the kitchen steady losing cheese
You my Tinkerbell, I'm your Peter Pan
Lets have a walk by the beach, let me hold your hand
I fuck with you one thousand cause you understand
You my hoe, I'm your only man
You a got nigga sitting in wonderland
Water whipping in the kitchen I don't need no hand
I'm grinding, oh no I don't need no friends
Cause your friends be the ones to cross you in the end
I had a couple boys [?] in the end
I'm sorry lord, I won't do it again
I promise lord I won't do it again
Stay humble, get your money, get out the jungle man

Riding in a old school but its new to me

Yeah them boys so strapped they some hooligans
I throw them racks they come right back like boomerang
