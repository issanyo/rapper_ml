Bitch I'm done with you
I thought I said I'm done with you
I hit my whoadie for the work (I hit my whoadie up)
Pull off in that Range, skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt
Bitch I'm done with you
I thought I said I'm done with you
Fuck my ex and fuck her bitches too
My eyes onto you, stop playing peekaboo
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt

[Verse]
I just pulled up with some baddies
While we're turned up at La Vie
I'm the quarterback, watch her get back as I throw my D
I got molly, I got weed, off that lean and Hennessy
"I wanna go home" if you're not built for this
Then there's the exit, my G
When I was on stage bitches laughed at me
Seven years later all their sisters listen to me
Now they catch feelings
Don't you dare make noise up in my building now
Who you gonna talk to when I'm flying out?
Faded and gone, and I'm smoking the strong
You know what I want I'm hitting that good good
All that she want is that good wood
Though I know you that like it in your belly
Feel like you should hit the telly
Though I know that you like it in your belly you feel
Feel like you should hit this
Tell us this money is love
Go to the watch and you know how these females all go
This not the time to act tough
Why don't you just give it up?
Real niggas don't play around
Bodies been dropping around
Mine now, now she coming pon di road
Don't come around, I don't know you anymore
I just hit my plug up, I'm in the city
I done kept it real, don't switch up on me

[Hook]
Bitch I'm done with you
I thought I said I'm done with you
I hit my whoadie for the work (I hit my whoadie up)
Pull off in that Range, skrt skrt skrt skrt skrt
Bitch I'm done with you
I thought I said I'm done with you
Fuck my ex and fuck her bitches too
My eyes onto you, stop playing peekaboo
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt skrt
Skrt skrt, (Went off in that Range) skrt skrt

[Outro: Kodak Black]
Girl I'm done with you
Girl we done it's through
I hit that nigga for the work
Stick and move, then I SKRT, SKRT, SKRT
SKRT, SKRT
What is up with you?
I thought I said I'm done with you
Fuck my school and fuck my teacher too
Sniper on the roof, he playing peek-a-boo
