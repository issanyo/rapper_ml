[Hook]
I'm running now, I'm on dead time I might kill the clock
I'm wondering why my niggas ain't my niggas now
Cause I'm rocking beats and I shift the streets and put the pistol down. I cropped me out lil Kodak see the big picture now
I ain't jackin now I'm rappin now
I'm bout business now
I love yall on the rap way to the different route
You ditching now, you tripping out, you dissin now
You switchin out
I get it now

[Verse 1]
Oh dat body is in the air
I feel it now
You speak in bad, you really mad
My ticks tocks
Boy you different niow heard you bang a whole nother clique now
I got my deposition, you said I did it you snitchin now
Wen u see a G don't speak to me put ya head down
You tellin now you bail in out
No bail bond
I moved on, ion do the shit that I used to do
I'm rappin now fuck nigga don't make me do you
Why my niggas ain't my niggas like they used to be?
And I got niggas show in moe love now, who're new to me
Don't call me now I'm ballin now you out da game
I see it clear, I cropped us out u out da frame

[Verse 2]
I can't believe you tattle told on me, the rules, the combination, you hacked da code on me

And don't say shit to me no more nigga be quiet
And I can't believe my niggas actin like my hoes now
They on my instagram they steady watchin my profile
