[Verse: Kodak Black]
I got quality and quantity
So every single day I keep droppin' shit
They just piss-test me today I was positive
Project baby, a product of my environment
They just put a trespass on me in the 'jects
Them crackas said they wanna never catch me in the 'jects
What you expect? For me to never come out of house?
Pop a X with my niggas, late night poppin' bottles
Just wanna hit the store and a buy bottle of some water
Post up on the stroll and hear what I been missing out on
My nigga say he went to rehab but he got right back on flocka
My other nigga popped a c class then that pussy came up out 'em
Like it's winter I be posted like a snowman but it's Autumn
Since elementary I wanted to be a G, I dreamed it back in Markham
My mom regret, I was always your lil' problem
Young nigga, I'm the husband in the house and I'm the father
My brother John Wicks, he was robbin' tell me nothing 'bout it
My brother was robbin' poppin'  tops but he ain't never tell me 'bout it
*Why didn't you pay for this beat though?*
What you mean why I ain't pay for this beat? 'Cause ima motherfucking robber
I was in Fort Myers I was 15, and I was servin' Demi Lovato
I tried to shoot 'em, he had the voo on him, I turned into a monster
I told my brother what happened to my revolver
I was so mad I asked my brother  "What the hell happened to my revolver?"
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
I was creepin', I was schemin', on that nigga on the low
I promise ain't nobody see me that whole weekend in the 'No
Ay, Ay, the world cold I put that heater on 'em tho
Wasn’t stressing but I wanted to relieve it on the [?]
My hammer broke, I ain't never seen this shit before
If I was him I woulda' beat me to the floor
Then that nigga started creepin' very slow
That nigga he started leavin' very slow
Started skipping, getting away like it’s a [?]
Yeah he protected, but he still scared of me
I was just 14 years old, I'm on methamphetamine
Y'all just sittin' 'round smokin' weed and watching Netflix
Every day I wanna do somethin' hot, in a stolo for no reason
Parked it in a vacant spot, and they towed 'cause I left it parked right in my neighbor lot, ay, I put that burner on that nigga, told him if he make one more move he gettin' popped
I dare you nigga, take one more step you gettin' stretched out
I customized a 38, it got a drum like I'm [?]
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
That was my last lick, but this my next stop
[?] my window roadrunning, got this rental here from Hertz
I'm conditioned trained myself to be authentic and be pure
And I'm back, got that black cat, make that kitty purr
Everything I rap about these streets would vouch for me I'm sure
Clothesline in my backyard, no new white tee, rewash dingy shirt
