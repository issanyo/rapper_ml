[Verse 1:]
I asked the lord to send me a sign
I seeing this shit real clear now
And it's all coming to  my brain man me and all you niggas we are not the same
Damn really down didn't wanna hang niggas only around for a little fame
Daang i can't make a nigga play me like a game everybody going through the same thing
Niggas throwing rocks at the chain gang
It's a dang shame shame trying to shine and you ain't got a damn thing
Niggas only wanna ride kenny payne niggas risk they life for a little change lil change
Sippin' lean tryin to ease the pain its so much rain on my windowpane kill another guy for a lil fame
Ain't have a dime now i gotta look change
What would you do to be a little popular what would you do for a oscar if it's about a dollar then she go hala every street nigga hit rock bottom
You ain't got no money you just got some problems
Hit a little witch you  turn around and rob you
Ain't no love boy these niggas sour
I just want no money and the fucking power
And it's all coming to my brain

[Chorus:]
And it's all coming to  my brain man me and all you niggas we are not the same
Damn really down didn't wanna hang niggas only around for a little fame
Daang i can't let a nigga play me like a game everybody going through the same thing
Niggas throwing rocks at the chain gang

[Verse 2:]
These niggas living in the sky wanna take a picture with me you just  wanna shine
Trying to shoot me down you don't wanna see me fly nigga come around me now i feel a funny vibe
I wonder why my dawg backstab me like a samurai
I'm on another vibe they ain't around for me they just wanna ride
On the inner state going out of state and you know i'm bout to come back with that bang
You ain't got to fly everybody know you fake
I'm out here in these streets am trying to make that shake early morning blowing purple nigga wake and bake
Ain't no time for that shit you perpetrate
Got to get it straight mama hair turning grey
Imma stay solid imma take that to ma grave (to mah grave)

[Chorus]
