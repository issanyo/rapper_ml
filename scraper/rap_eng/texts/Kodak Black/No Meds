[Hook]
I'm grindin', I can't even get no rest
I'm vibin', I ain't even take my meds
Everybody like "what the fuck goin' on in your head"
I'm from Broward County, but not the same place as X
Yeah, I just fucked my ex bitch on that X
Say she miss me and she wanna get in my chest
Say she miss me when I used to have my dreads
And my niggas miss when I ain't had no bread

[Verse 1]
Say she love me, but I know that it's a test
I don't know how to answer that so I know I might get a F
I don't wanna do no quiz
I just wanna get a little smizzed
Why it gotta come down to this?
I just wanna shoot the shits
Say she pregnant, let me fuck so I can feed the kids
I know you don't like me well when I run up so I can split your wig
I'm gettin' tired of gettin' money 'cause all I do is get it
I went to sleep on stage, woke up and did another gig
Came home and did a bid, came home and did another bid
I don't watch no sports no more 'cause all that shit be rigged
I'm doin' too much, I got 30 in my clip
You shootin' too much, man, that nigga already dead
My little lady be like "Zaddy where you been"
I ain't yo daddy, but I prefer that name instead
I went to TV and put VVS on my set
So when you see me, you know he be gettin' checks

[Hook]
I'm grindin', I can't even get no rest
I'm vibin', I ain't even much take my meds
Everybody like "what the fuck goin' on in your head"
I'm from Broward County, but not the same place as X
Yeah, I just fucked my ex bitch on that X
Say she miss me and she wanna get in my chest
Say she miss me when I used to have my dreads
And my niggas miss when I ain't had no bread

[Verse 2]
My nigga miss when I was still on the corner
Yeah, my niggas miss when I was in the yoda
Yeah, my niggas miss me when I was sellin' 'Yoda crack
"I watched him go up, now they call him Kodak Black!"
I fucked her in the ass and then I shitted on her
Ay, I skeeted on her face and then I hit it on her
Ay, I ain't take my prescriptions in a whole month
And I'm on my bullshit, I'm about to go nuts
I was doin' time and then detective showed up
Askin' about a murder, I told him "I don't know nothin'"
Y'all can call my lawyer, by the way, I got 4 of 'em
That money callin', by the way, I got 4 numbers

[Interlude]
Phone ringing
Hello?
Man, you trippin', man, you know I ain't go no more, umm, shit, it's whatever then, send me 4 of 'em!
