Pesos Baby

[Intro]
Who that?

[Hook]
It's Lil Kodak in this shit
So what, So what
I'm Still hittin licks
I be in the studio
I'm dropping hits
And plus, guess what
I'm Still hittin' licks

[Verse 1]
That rappin' put the Rollie on my wrist
I hit a lick and put some Forgi's on my whip
Stick and move I'm on it everyday
Run up on me, Imma let it spray
Haitian boy I'm riding with the flag
Bible on the mother fucking dash
Boy I tear the street up when I pass
SKRT-SKRT Jag on ya' ass
Getting money, I be bossin' up my life
You a junky, you just flocking up your life
I'm in the field running with my gun
Look at you, you walking with a knife
Kodak boppin' on them Mollies I be turned up every night
In the trap house with my partners, then we out here shooting-dice
Boy I'm still hittin licks
I be with the shits
It's lil' Kodak and you know that
It won't get no real than this
Crackas gave my dog a sentence, ended with a period
I'm so serious, Road Runner, I'm mysterious
And yo' girl friend is a monkey, she so curious

[Chorus]
Who the hell is this man
It's lil' Kodak in this shit
So what, so what
I'm Still hittin' licks
I be in the studio
I'm dropping hits
And plus guess what
I'm Still hittin' licks

[Verse 2]
I'm in New York
I'm ballin like the Knicks
Fourteen years old, I was baggin on them nicks
Had the zone and pad
I Re'd-Up wit' the Crip
No Doritos Bag, I'm all about my chips
Hitting licks, I finesse your shit
Then take off with your shit
How I jump right through yo' window just call me Karate Kid
"Real recognize real" Nigga it's so obvious
I got ninety-nine problems, I got zero tolerance
Dirty money, Dirty filthy money
Yeah that sloppy shit
On that 'ngac, sippin' on that Brown yeah that Bobby shit
Keep that shit 1K
Yeah I still be clutchin' on my .40
He a phony, He is not my homie, Ion fuck with Shorty
And I'm on my way to my lick
He say he want a 40
My daddy ran away from me somebody call Maury
Raiders hit the block, they pulled up right up on me
They was rolling in a Taurus
You ain't hear my motherfucking chorus?
I jump right through your window and you know it
It's lil' Kodak Black!
Polo to the floor
Sippin on lean ion drink no fuckin Mo√©t

[Chorus]
Who the hell is this man?
It's lil' Kodak in this shit
So what, so what
I'm Still hittin' licks
I be in the studio
I'm dropping hits
And plus guess what
I'm Still hittin' licks
