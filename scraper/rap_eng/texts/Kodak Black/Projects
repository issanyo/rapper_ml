[Intro]
Damn I can't wait till I get me a Bugatti
Damn I can't wait till I get me a Bugatti

[Hook: Kodak Black]
What you see is what you get 'cause I'm from out the projects
Remember slidin' in the Yota, duckin', dodgin'
Now my Cutlass seats so high, don't know how to drive it
I'm on A1A slidin', but I ain't got no license
What you see is what you get 'cause I'm from out the projects
Remember slidin' in the Yota, duckin', dodgin'
Now my Cutlass seats so high, don't know how to drive it
I'm on A1A slidin', but I ain't got no license

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Mama went to work, I'm in here fuckin' with the Pyrex
Got the pot bubblin', you think I'm a scientist
Early mornin', I just came up with a hypothesis
Straight drop gate rock, you be re-rockin' it
Even when I take a shower, I'mma take the Glock with me
I went up top with two pieces on me, call it chocolate
Your old lady keep on callin' me, I'm 'bout to block the bitch
And my car is so done, you got to push it just to start the shit
Went to school, I jumped the fence
Went to school, I get suspended
Sliding soft, my windows tinted
In a foreign, don't get offended
Been 1K since the beginnin'
It ain't personal, it's business
If I said it, bitch, I meant it
ATV this how I'm livin'

[Hook: Kodak Black]
What you see is what you get 'cause I'm from out the projects
Remember slidin' in the Yota, duckin', dodgin'
Now my Cutlass seats so high, don't know how to drive it
I'm on A1A  slidin', but I ain't got no license
What you see is what you get 'cause I'm from out the projects
Remember slidin' in the Yota, duckin', dodgin'
Now my Cutlass seats so high, don't know how to drive it
I'm on A1A slidin', but I ain't got no license

[Verse 2: Birdman]
My little nigga so cool
