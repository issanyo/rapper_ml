[Intro: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Yeah, yeah (Kodak)
Yeah, yeah (You know dat)

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm tryin' not to get locked up back again
Had to take a lot of losses just to win
I was young, jumped in that water, been swimmin' ever since
Then I drowned, I never noticed how deep that I went
Head first, ain't waste no time, I dive right in
And life's a bitch, she spread them legs, I slide right in
This ain't a game, I'm runnin' 'round eatin' like Pac-Man
Fuck the fame, I knew I was a star since back then
Way back then, was gettin' them chips like Low-So
I think I'm way before my time, say I got a old soul
With the grown folks, shootin' dice by the dope [?]
I got ice runnin' through my veins, my heart just so cold

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
It's a shame how much pain I brought my mama through
I just want to get her a new Range, maybe one or two
Me and all you niggas ain't the same, I ain't one of you
Homie you a lame, you can't hang with this money crew
Lately I ain't been gettin' no sleep, I'm just [?]
One day you'll wake up and your dream right in front of you
How you tellin' all your homies you can't even tell time?
They been sleepin' on the kid, it ain't even bedtime
I been goin' hard, I'm on the grind, ain't no spare time
And I keep the tool in the trunk like a spare tire
Way back, hittin' licks with my clique spazzin' out
[?] cashin' out

[Chorus: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family (me and my family)
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, Rolly told me it's my time
'Cause it's my time, yeah
On my grind, I can't work no nine to five
'Cause it's my time, yeah
It's my time, if I'm lyin', then I'm flyin'

[Outro: Derrick Milano & Kodak Black]
Way before my time
It's my time, you don't see it, then you blind
