[Verse 1]
The freedom bell ring when they set a nigga free
I'm flyin’ like an eagle when they let me off the leash
Gotta prove everybody wrong lookin' down on me
When I'm flyin’ like an eagle
In the streets where I call home, this is where I wanna be
Do I gotta go to jail so I can find a lil' peace?
Could you be the one I call on, will you answer when you sleep?
Could you be the one I call on?

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck
I'm searchin' for my soul, hope you know where it went
Is it cold like my heart, could it take me where I've never been?
I'm never really happy, smilin' when it’s never meant

[Chorus]
I’ve been searchin' for my soul, my heart
Di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
I got this money, but it’s nothin' right now
'Cause I'm needin’ somethin'
I'm needin' somethin'
I've been searchin' for my soul, my heart
Di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
I got this money, but it's nothin' right now
'Cause I'm needin' somethin'

[Verse 2]
All this pain make me sing songs
Ain't no love in the sewer that I came from
Ain't no love in the sewer that I came in from
I can't say that I don't miss my nigga John John
Got the streets cheerin' for me with they pom-poms
I done ran up all this money, got me nauseous
I done ran up all this money, got me nauseous
I done did so many wrongs, it got me cautious
But I can't ever tell the time in all these watches
And I can never read the mind of all these thotties
Broward County, poppin' Molly, droppin' bodies
I can't lie and say that I don't love you, shawty
You know that you want me right there, well, you got me
All this fame got me nauseous
Tryna dodge the reaper got me boxed in

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck
I'm searchin' for my soul, hope you know where it went
Is it cold like my heart, could it take me where I've never been?
I'm never really happy, smilin' when it's never meant

[Chorus]
I've been searchin' for my soul, my heart
Di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
I got this money, but it's nothin' right now
'Cause I'm needin' somethin'
I'm needin' somethin'
I've been searchin' for my soul, my heart
Di yon mo pou mwen kumbayah
I got this money, but it's nothin' right now
'Cause I'm needin' somethin'
'Cause I'm needin' somethin'
