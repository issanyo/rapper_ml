[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block
If I miss, I'ma spin the block
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse: 22Gz]
Get the chips, gotta get the guap
Word to mother, we tote blicks, I got hella opps
Headshot, face shot, if them rakes was dropped
ABC and WPIX11, yellow tape the block
That pussy, I'ma punish that
Them blickys, I'm in love with that
Tuck it like a running back, we throwin' like some quarterbacks
Choppers like a lumberjack, hell nah I ain't with none of that
Say some shit, they run with that, got dracos with the drum attached
Take a spin, let's go kill a opp
Hollow tips give up his liver, they know how we pop
It ain't safe, yeah we spin a lot
Broad day, head tap, I done killed a lot

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block
If I miss, I'ma spin the block
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I don't know about them, I don't know about yall, but I'ma keep a Glock
Don't play with me, I swear for God, I'll get a nigga shot
And I can't let you hold the rod, I don't know what you 'bout
Say I be runnin' with the squad cause we all we got
Me and 22Gz, hit yo scene, sprayin' .223's
I'm just tryna beat, when I skeet, baby you can leave
I can't even see, all this blood in my eye-e's
Let me in the club with my gun, that's my ID
Damn, how the fuck I'm in a Jag' and I'm sniping? (Yeah)
Hit yo' block with no tag and no high beams
Sniper Gang, boy you know who got your nigga popped
Broad day, don't check, I done killed a lot

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block
If I miss, I'ma spin the block
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop

[Verse 3: 22Gz]
If he act up, we gon' spin his block, make it hot
Everything litty, Henny in the spot
I got niggas, got the gang with me, they know how we rockin'
I got aim with it, blickys get to poppin'
I keep one up in the head, run up on him, he ain't dead
Valentino's [?], oh yeah y'all ain't did that yet
I love runnin' up these bands, gettin' money, need that cheddar
I got 5-0 on my back, FTO, don't get caught slippin'
Early mornin' and we fishin', I'm tryna catch a victim
Switch the plates up on the Civic, we purging tryna kill him
Beat my charges, now it's litty
Gang-Gang and they comin' with me
The Gang and they comin' with me

[Chorus: 22Gz]
Sellin' packs by the laundromat
Once I get up out the hood, I ain't comin' back
But I still keep a blicky, I ain't done with that
Once she stop frontin' with that pussy, I'ma punish that
And if I miss, I'ma spin the block
Even if I hit, I'ma spin the block
If I miss, I'ma spin the block
Run up on him with the blick, I'ma let it flop
