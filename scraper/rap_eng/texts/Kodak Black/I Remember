Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it

[Verse 1]
My mama told me do it
Just can't get discouraged (keep courage)
I'm gonna give her the world
And I'm so determined (determined)
The lights ain't ever working
Got me snatching purses (snatching purses)
I jumped up off the porch
Out here with a purpose (purpose)
Goddamn this world dirty
Whole family hurting (world dirty)
Lil nigga out here lurking
Got my mama worried (worried)
In the studio I'm on it
And I'm dropping verses (dropping verses)
Now these niggas acting like Lil Kodak ain't deserve it

[Hook]
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it

[Verse 2]
Talking way before the fame
I was broke (ain't have no money)
Yeah when I was snatching chains
Had no hope (still ain't have no money)
Steady wrapped in chains
Jail back and forth (for that money)
I was going insane
Had nowhere to go (for that money)
They calling me names
They cracking jokes (it ain't even funny)
Back when I was lame
Was nobody close (nobody close to me)
Told lil mama blow
Niggas ain't believe me (but they ain't listening)
My mixtape free
But they be tryna buy my CD (tryna buy my CD)
I was out here scheming
Talking to those demons (to them demons)
They say I'm arrogant
Say I'm so conceited (I'm conceited)
You should be happy
I was blind now I'm seeing (ain't shit to see)
Nightmares going crazy
Ghetto dreaming (when I was dreaming)
When I was itching for that money
Out here fiending (I'm out here fiending)
Somebody feed me
Because my stomach steady screaming (know i need it)
Now you want some fame
Coming up you can't believe it (fame off of me)
Billie Jean
Michael Jackson nigga beat it!
