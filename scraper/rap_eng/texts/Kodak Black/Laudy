[Intro]
That's my baby she from Laudy
That's my baby she from Holly
That's my baby she from Laudy

[Verse]
That's my baby she from Laudy
I'm gone pick up I'm gone pull up when she call me
I'm gone pick up I'm gone pull up in a Audi
I got ice cubes where my heart be
I be freezing I be drowning
I was cheating and she saw me
Assault rifle in the laundry
I tried to hide it but she found it
All you wanna do is doubt
All you ever do is doubt me
You just with me for my clout
I ain't stupid I got knowledge
All this dripping like a fountain
Dead presidents look like a mountain
Drip drip, I'm drippin like I'm [?]
I'm dripping like I'm [?]
I be smoking on a plane, gaggin
Kodak I'ma hop out on a band wagon
Aye I be geeking like I'm book smart
I be preaching like I'm Al Sharpton
I'm so litty like a liquor bottle
I'm so lit they call me Remy Martin
I'm so lit I crashed and dipped hard
I'm so lit I broke her damn heart
I'm so lit I don't know where to damn start
I'm so lit I don't feel my damn heart
My lil lady she from Mannors Park
My lil lady out the Nolia
She be right here like she posed to
She my favorite cause we Nolia
That's my baby that's my soldier
Restaurant we eating like we starving
At the fountain blue we drink like we flounder
I'm from the No but my lil hoe from Laudy
She be like rest in peace to Martin
My lil lady she from parkway
She be like get that money bae fuck what they all say
My dick be stuck on hard I'm fuckin with her all day
I'm eating calamari fuck the rari this a Audi R8
I promise I ain't fuck her she just suck my dick that's all bae
I'm sorry I ain't fuck her she just suck my dick that's all
We got the same birthday that's my twin like that's my dawg
Bending corners through reveers shawty from the raw
And I hit her raw cause she clean like she be mopping
And I hit her raw cause she clean like she do laundry
My lil baby raw she be dripping at my closet
My lil baby raw she be dripping like she faucet
That lil pussy wet that pussy wet just like she fountain
A-E-I-O-U she make me wanna say my vowels
And in my mind its all for you its gone be you cause I be vowing
They kicked me out of school but I ain't no fool cause I got honors
Ain't go to college but I ain't no fool just cause I'm from the projects
I'm bending corners with that tool I keep that what you call it
Bending corners with that wooly keep that what you call
Leave the scenery she break her neck she see me, drop her draws
She say "Kodak you my favorite, how it feel to be a star?"
All this shit just a fa√ßade, its Hollywood, shit ain't real
Say bae this Hollywood this shit ain't real
I'm really in the streets these niggas industry they ain't real
These niggas Hollywood, they Beverly Hills
These niggas sucking meat for a deal
I'm dying on my feet fore I take a kneel
But my lil lady she from Laudy
