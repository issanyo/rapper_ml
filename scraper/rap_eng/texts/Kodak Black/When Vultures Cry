[Intro]
I guess you wasn't nothin' different than them after all
Booted up, Molly jolly, no Adderall
I got tired of eatin' PB&J, noodle casserole
All my niggas behind the wall
All my niggas, they in the pen
Or they in the grave
Flyin' in the dove, nigga, fuck a Wraith

[Chorus]
This what it sound like
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Booted up, I'm high, booted up out my mind
I'm booted up out my mind
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when I try to cry
I be tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I was tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I couldn't even watch you cry

[Verse]
Jumped up out the womb like my daddy the devil
My son jumped up out the womb like his daddy the devil
Life's been better
I thank the Lord life's been better
Ever since I dropped up outta school, nigga, life's been better
Since I ran out with the tool just to get me some cheddar
Had to jump out on a fool, whacked him, teach him a lesson
Lil' nigga, I ain't sparin' you, so I don't need you to spare me
I had jumped up off the porch headfirst, I was ready
'Bout that fetty, take a nigga ass away from his family
To hear my nigga tell it, man, that shit damn embarrassing
Go back to hittin' licks, got me thuggin' in Maryland
Smokin' gas, got my tank on 93 supreme
Smokin' gas, drinkin' oil, no kerosene
Had to fill all my guns up with blackheads
Fill my guns up with diamonds, so I run the biz
Fill my gums up with diamonds, look like gingivitis
All this money got me lookin' like Illuminati
He done caught his first body, swear he did enough
You can't tell him nothin', feel like he a real thug
Even in the rap shit, I get real love
But how you knowin' real love when you ain't got a feeling?
What you know about trust when you not feeling?
I came up, now they pay a nigga top penny
Birdman tryna give the kid a couple million
Before Atlantic Records signed me, I was gettin' chicken
I was scammin', I was plannin' on the same dream
I got tired of baloney sandwich, no canteen
Got tired of PB&J, noodle casserole
I drink the coffee with the Molly, no Adderall
I guess someone not different than him after all
Stayin' focused on the cheddar, I be spazzin' now
Why you think they call him Kodak Black? I be blackin' out
These niggas want me in the box like I'm Pacquiao
Losin' all my niggas, started drinkin' alcohol
I jumped out the womb like my daddy the devil
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm clever, yeah
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm special, yeah
I got a couple million, also tote a Beretta
I dropped out of school just to get me some cheddar

[Chorus]
This what it sound like
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Booted up, I'm high, booted up out my mind
I'm booted up out my mind
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when a vulture cry
This what it sound like when I try to cry
I be tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I was tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I couldn't even watch you cry
