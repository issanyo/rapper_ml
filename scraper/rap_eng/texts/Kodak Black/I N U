[Intro]
Aye
Goin' up top catchin' plays like I'm Victor Cruz nigga
And I'm catchin' picks, I'm catchin' yours too nigga
You ain't Drew Brees nigga, that's a flu flicker

[Verse]
My nigga still be stealin' cars, he love that stuff nigga
He done brought me a brand new car, I told him "Nigga get me a rental"
Like how the hell I'ma tell him chill, that shit ain't cool nigga
'Cause I used to do it with him and I maneuver in 'em
Damn right we hit the scene together, I hit the news with him
But I hit news by myself before I hit the news with him
I ain't tellin' you how I'ma play it, I ain't tellin' you how I move nigga
Hell yeah that's what I do, but that ain't what I do nigga
I don't even feel like nigga tellin' ya kids to stay in school
'Cause I always did the opposite, nigga I ain't stay in school
Maybe if they told me not to go, I probably would've stayed in school
Codeine and orange soda, that's my formula, Ion want baby food
I don't eat baby food, I don't eat baby food
Put a "O" in front of the Range Rover, that's a orange coop
That's a strange coupe, that's a orange Range Rover coupe
That's a o-range rover, that's a fruit
Y'all so cute together, she for you, she a swoop
On a boot, 1800 Tequila, I'm litty like Peter Boo
Peter Boo thought she for him, she for me, she for you
No, SG is not a crew, we a team, not a crew
This shit deeper to me than you, you can't even see no we and you
You creep just like them people too, that's why it ain't no me and you
I go peep the truth, see Pooh, he could shoot on the roof, he peekaboo
I say my vowels for the dollar bill, I "A-E-I-O-U"
First thing first is I-O-U, I'ma spray first if I owe you
My nigga in prison goin' crazy, keep on askin' me 'bout his lady
I ain't finna be out here watchin' her page, I ain't finna be out here stalkin' yo lady
And my brother 'bout to have a baby, 'bout to be a uncle and I'm a baby
Paranoid, I'm livin' dangerous, paranoid, I'm overthinkin'
Wrap the car up just to spray it, put it up then candy paint it
I'm a baby with a baby, I done killed so much-a babies
I done kidnapped, I done whipped so much-a babies
If the neighbors hear me, they gon' call the police
Child neglect, call the DCF on me
Child abuse, I'm in the kitchen droppin' a 14
All that night I was ridin' 'round the city to this slow beat
If the neighbors hear me, they gon' call the police
DCF called child neglect on me
Water whippin' in the kitchen, I'm droppin' a 14
Got that glizzy, ridin' 'round the city to this slow beat

[Outro]
I done lost my mind all night, when I grind I don't get no sleep
You goddamn right once they let me out, I'm in yo' hoe cheeks
I think these niggas lactose intolerant, they don't get no cheese
