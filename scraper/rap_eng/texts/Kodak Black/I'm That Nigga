[Intro 1: Kodak Black]
Aye man let me get my Rem on ice man

Let me get my back in before I hit yo city, or I ain't going straight up, for real

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Excuse me where my stylist?

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I told them that the money train is coming, don't get left (don't get left)
Nigga should've hurried up and jumped up on my trail
Niggas on that groupie shit, they talking me to death
Fuck that bouji bitch you ain't got nothing go to hell
