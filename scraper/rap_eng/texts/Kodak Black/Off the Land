[Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

[Verse 1]
I'm paintin' pictures, everythin' I say you see it vivid
Lil' Kodak makin' movies, I have you feelin' like you in it
I don't make no bubblegum music, I spit that real shit
You don't live this life, when you hear my songs, you'll feel like you lived it
I don't got no lady 'cause these bitches never like to listen
Gettin' bread every day, I graduated from biscuits
I don't do karate, so why lil' shawty wanna kick it?
The Audi got four rings, it think a nigga in the Olympics
I be money-launderin'
I got zero tolerance
When I get home I gotta hit (baby)
You better be in your lingerie (baby)

[Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties

[Verse 2]
Ain't talkin' Disney but I had to get it off the land
When you see me, I'm booted up, ain't talkin' Timberland
No not Boyardee but free my niggas in the can
How can you even sleepin' knowin' that you ratted on your man?
Like a newborn baby, how I'm suckin' on her breast
I got two fingers up her dress and she already wet
I'm calculatin' every move, this shit like playin' chess
AR-15 with the scope just like I'm Ron Artest
All you bitches, you can't touch this like I'm MC Hammer
Where were you when I was cuttin' dope with Arm & Hammer?
When I was jumpin' in them houses like I'm fuckin' Santa
They send me to the slammer, you won't even send a letter

[Chorus]
The man with the plan, I ain't playin', I'm 'bout business
Lil' Kodak had to get it off the land, talkin' Disney
You told on your mans, went to sing like you Whitney
Floatin' on a Xan, I swear to God, it got me dizzy
Project baby, I remember eatin' lilly-dillys
Culinary arts, I do my thing in the kitchen
If I go to jail, you niggas will never come and visit
You think she breast feedin' me, how I'm suckin' on her titties
