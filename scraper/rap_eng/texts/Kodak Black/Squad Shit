[Hook: John Wicks & Kodak Black]
John Wicks, all I know is mob shit
Sniper Gang stay on that squad shit
Once that Glock hit, can't call for god bitch
ZMF runnin' wit' them zombies
Niggas gettin' wet, be cautious do not slip
Ain't even got to rap, I'm a get these racks regardless
I respect you if you respect me, that's 1000
I show love, I ain't pay no homage that's nonsense

[Verse 1: John Wicks]
Regardless, we knock you out the frame bruh
I'm honest I came wit' them snipers
Z up, never fold on them
Peter, brother of my brother
Comin', boy we come in 50
Shots in, boy we come in 50
I would never fold on my brother
No homage, I'm comin' straight bustin'
[?] she know I'm a lick her
Come through shootin' [?] racer
In the jungle, I be goin' ape bruh
1800 block, I'm from Golden Acres

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Free my gunners in the pen, remember a few summers back
Was hittin' licks was glad to be here, we done found the map
We ain't even got the duffle, we done found the map
I felt happy when I gave my momma a hundred stacks
This my brother on the track, got a bih prego
How I'm finna lose, nigga I got to get the pesos
We were hollerin' baby K's, you ain't know 'bout Dracos
I was felony lane gang, so I got to lay low
