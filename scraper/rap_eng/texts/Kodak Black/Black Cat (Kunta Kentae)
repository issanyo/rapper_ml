[Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

[Verse 1]
Same night me and Debo took the Mazda, bih we crashed
Bentley Bentayga, snapping like a lobster fuck a crab
They caught the helicopter, I don't want y'all to think I'm tryna flex
Nigga, what's your f'n problem? I'm on that Effen vodka, smoking gas
Yeah, beep, beep, I'm the nigga roadrunning to that cash
Fuck a frisbee, I'll spin n' bend a nigga like I'm Taz
Fuck my daddy, I can't believe I nutted out your sack
Fuck my daddy nigga, it's me and my momma sons like I'm Nash
I made my son king, put this crown on, fuck a ski mask
I swear to god, I get a hard on when this heat blast
Type it like a spacebar, fuck a keypad, think I keep that Mac
Hot shifter, can't control my pace, command, delete his ass

[Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past

[Verse 2]
I'm hooked on phonics, hooked on Phoenix balling like I'm Steve Nash
Promise you ain't see me, I was in Buffalo with Ray
How you finna cut the hole, y'all just bad
In Charlotte, made a movie with that poker, left a scab
In Raleigh, fell in love with fraud, [?] on that slazz
Steady scheming, burying cheese and burying pieces in the grass
Controversy between the both supremacies, they gone be mad
Martin Luther King, last night I had a dream about his ass
No Rosa Parks, them shooters posted in the back
Nelson Mandela, rocking Maison Margielas, remember wearing Shaqs
Life's a gamble, play the hands they dealt me I'm a wizard at blackjack
In the Jaguar XF, putting a spell on you late night in the black cat

[Chorus]
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up in the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
Feel like somebody put a cast on my ass
I'm dropping bad luck, I pull up, the black Jag
Can't fit these shoes, it's seven and a half
I'm focused on my future, I ain't dwelling in the past
