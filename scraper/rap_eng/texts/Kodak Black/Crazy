[Verse 1]
I kinda feel some type of way right now, it's crazy
It's a lot of shit on my mind, I'm up just thinkin'
I got shit to say but don't know how to say it
I be feelin' like everybody be tryna play me
If you my bih then let them niggas know you taken
Would you be my bih even if I don't ever make it?
If I lose it all right now bet you gon' shake me
She don't like me, she just wanna have my baby
I been on point cause I been outchea since a baby
They left me standin' out the door while it was rainin'
It get cold they wouldn't much let me get a blanket
Now I'm spreadin' Benjamin Franklin's in they faces
It's Lil Kodak, I be flexin' and they hate it
Maybe they don't like me just because I'm Haitian
Sittin' 'round me but you schemin' on my bracelet
Rock designer, always jump out with the latest
Pullin' up in foreigns, I might hop out with yo' lady
She don't wanna fuck with you no more, she say you basic
I don't need nobody to handle my situation
I be duckin' from the cops like it's the Matrix
