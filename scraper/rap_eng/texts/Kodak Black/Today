Sorry, I don't want to sound offensive
But today, I don't want to take no pictures
Today, I'm not Kodak I'm Lil Bill
Today, I don't give a fuck how you feel
And I don't wanna go in front of no crowd
Today, I wanna tote my .40 cal
Sorry, I ain't wanna take your mixtape
Sorry, I forgot it was your b-day
I don't give a fuck about your birthday
You ain't ever tell me happy birthday
Today they gon' read my nigga verdict
Today I might post a Throwback Thursday

[Verse 1]
She wanna fuck with me because I'm Haitian
And that boy don't fuck with me because I'm Haitian
Fuck the fame, I be in my own lane paper chasin'
Road runnin, gettin' to the money I be drag racin'
I wanna fuck you too girl but I can't
Your boyfriend ain't gon' play my songs again
Well fuck it, you ain't gotta be a fan
Nigga is you a groupie or my friend?
Fuck your daughter, I ain't comin to her party
Imma be there Kodak boppin, acting rowdy
I don't think you want me at her party, I might lace the birthday cake with molly
I'm in the mall, don't talk to me I'm shoppin'
Baby girl, your MCM be flockin'
Sorry, I don't mean to disrespect him
But nigga, I ain't come to hear no lectures

[Hook]
Sorry, I don't want to sound offensive
But today, I don't want to take no pictures
Today, I'm not Kodak I'm Lil Bill
Today, I don't give a fuck how you feel
And I don't wanna go in front of no crowd
Today, I wanna tote my .40 cal
Sorry, I ain't wanna take your mixtape
Sorry, I forgot it was your bday
I don't give a fuck about your birthday
You ain't ever tell me happy birthday
Today they gon' read my nigga verdict
Today I might post a Throwback Thursday
