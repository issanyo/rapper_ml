[Intro]
The myth

[Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake back

[Verse 1]
Pokin windows that's la Jackboy n la J Black
I'm 'bout to wet the Cutlass, fuck a Maybach
Free J Green, they tryna give him 8 flat
I went duffin' up da state I caught the plane back
If rap don't work, then I'm back up on that same crap
You can leave, baby, you gon' find your way back
He can't even spell, but he can sell dope
Once you come up from that corner, boy you gettin' low
They been lookin' for the boy, think they tryna scope
They gon' pop it, you can lock it, you still gettin' poked
I remember you was ballin', now you dead broke
The last time I seen that nigga, he was smokin' ports
I got nigga locked up, and they losin' hope
I don't do it for the hood, I do it for my folks
The neighbors on us, so we hit the bad up
But now I'm on the radio, no more camera

[Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake back

[Verse 2]
I've been stayin' focused since I came back
But I will still push your top, way back
I got some money, a lil' power, and some fame too
I just want the money, but they gave me fame too
You ain't really in the hood, I just came through
In the Audi A4 and the paint blue
They gon' love you now but later they gon' hate you
My lil' bitch from Gainesville, I call her gator boo
I ain't made the rules, but I break the rules
I was fucked up by that movie, now I'm paid in full
Go hard like go, go, do your thing boo
Get that money, just don't let that shit done change you
Left the high early, I ain't go to school
Young nigga bendin' corners in the old school
I just bought a new strap, no that's not my crew
I keep playin' with it, y'all might see me on the news

[Hook]
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake back
