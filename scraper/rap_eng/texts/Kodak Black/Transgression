[Intro]
Tired
Glee, gleeful
This how you step, right here, look

[Chorus]
I be slidin' 'round with my firearm, I gotta keep a weapon
I be ridin' 'round everywhere, I dare one of y'all lil' niggas to test me
I keep on drivin' 'round, got me goin' through all these transgressions
Shootin' niggas and foolin' 'round, won't let me see my blessin'
I be slidin' 'round with my firearm, I gotta keep a weapon
I be ridin' 'round everywhere, I dare one of y'all lil' niggas to test me
I keep on drivin' 'round, got me goin' through all these transgressions
Shootin' niggas and foolin' 'round, won't let me see my blessin'

[Verse]
I did everything the streets told me was cool to do
Now I'd rather prove it to myself before I prove to you
I never tell, put me in jail, put me in any dorm
And I can make it through whatever, I'll weather any storm
Say park the Wraith outside the prison when I EOS
My mama told me 'bout you niggas, I swear she know best
My bitch did a whole bid with me, that's my baby
Not showin' off, I blowed up, she 'bout to have my baby
I swear it feel like yesterday, I was just in the county
When me and Snake was talkin' 'bout how we was in the projects
When we was on the ugly corner, we were poppin' Molly
How we be bootin' up on niggas when they actin' rowdy
Sniper Gang, I hate how I can't have my niggas 'round me
We love each other so much our energies just keep collidin'
We down to suit up any moment, we be too excited
And free Lil Cool, it's been a minute since we reunited
My nigga Pee just caught a body and he still fightin' it
I hate I fell in love with thuggin', I give my mama anxiety
I love Lil DJ like a brother, you play with him, I'll kill you
Lil' Jackboy shoulda just been my brother, I swear I love that nigga
I don't even need your love no more, I got a little heart
I do my own time, I don't need no nigga to take no charge
I couldn't even get a letter from you and that was your gun
You ain't send me nothin' or ask no boy, "How your lil' brother doin'?"
