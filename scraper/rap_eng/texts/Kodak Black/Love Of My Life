Heart of the projects
Kodak, Kodak
Project baby
1800 block

I was a lil boy, I'm still a lil boy
Can't discriminate me, they know I go hard
90' baby, stay down from the start
And where I'm from the young niggas running yard
Me and my youngis on the pills rolling hard
Getting money, we was on the pills trynna rob
All of us got a grill and we getting guwop
Cash for gold junkie, chop shop with your car
Damn, I feel in the love of codeine
I'm cheating got a bitch on side me so mean
Imma tell my girl I feel in love with your Jordyn
Something holding me back, Kodak, don't leave!
She being down a long time, that the homie
But you change my mind, put it on me
I'd be talking to God, I'd be getting lonely
I'd be asking him why, everybody phony
Said the world is mine I feel like Tony
All night on the grind I lose sleep for it
And I jump out the porch like run forest
How Imma shine when they steady throwing shade on me
She is the love of my life
Black boy, young nigga, hit the chain gang twice
Watching out for the rats in a mice
Trying to get this cake and don't you ask me for a slice
Made my first stack, it was love at first sight
Fake love where I came from on the first night
Is lil chey black, catch me in the back rolling dice
Married to the game, bitch, got me doing rice
Out all night holding on a pipe
Now I'm getting right I'll be holding on the mic
Let me go back, take you way back
Before Kodak, lil chay black
We lost the house and I hate that
Addicted fast money can't shake it
I'll be trying shake that
Momma trying on her own and I hate that
Need to slow down on, where my brakes at?
Got me thinking, smoking gas like the race track
I'll be working that ass, I'll be doing it good
But I've been hurt in the bed
She say "Kodak you'll be hurting me bad
You'll be hurting me bad"
You are the love of my life
Hold the pipe now I'm holding the mic
I do it wrong but I'll be doing it right
She said "Kodak, you are the love of my life"
I told the microphone you are the love of my life
You go girl, you could be my wife
Hey, I've been working that ass
Doing at club but I'll be hurt in the bed
Yeah, I'll be hurt in the bed
She deserves she bad
She make me wanna purchase that bag
