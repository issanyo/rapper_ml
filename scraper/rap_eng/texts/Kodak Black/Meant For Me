[Hook]
I'm about to see who really for a nigga
If I ain't have no money, would you still adore a nigga?
They way you bend on me baby
They way you blow a nigga
These niggas dick ride me, don't even know a nigga
Man I'm bout to see who really meant for me
Sooner or later God finna send hint to me
And why you questioning me? That's what my bitch do
You niggas stay on my trail, look what this shit do

[Verse 1]
Damn, you and me niggas ain't the same
I stay in my lane cus I'm just tryna stack my chain
But all you niggas lame you niggas just wanna hang
I'm in it to win it you niggas in it for the fame
It ain't the niggas, it be the hoes who really game
And hoe you just wanna fuck a nigga cus my name (Kodak)
And everytime I talk my mouth blang, you know that
Nigga plottin' on you for your chain
Next to me thinkin' how you want my pinky ring
Do a nigga dirty, have a nigga like damn
Your family do you dirty too, man it's a shame
Hoe do you dirty have a real nigga in pain

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm stayin' humble, I ain't tryna have no baby momma
I ain't tryna do no more time, I'm tryna bubble
And I'm so tired of momma cryin' cus I'm in trouble
I'm tryna get her eyes, I'm a young hustler
I lived my whole life tryna get from under
My home boys snake now, he an anaconda
I can't fuck with you no more bruh, I'm just bein' honest
I just got off probation, they mad I'm (?)
Yall be ready to hate, go get some damn money
I was money hungry so I went to Benihana's
That (?) right on my plate, I told her no onions
Now I'm (?)
I be on a paper chase, I hit the store runnin'
And I love to get the money, it's gon' keep comin'
I couldn't never save it up, use to keep fumblin'
I love my brother, without him I wouldn't be nothing
(I wouldn't be shit)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look what this shit do
Man, look what this shit do
Look what that money shit do
Look what the fame do
Look what the game do
Look what the change do
I ain't change, this shit changed you
Nigga who are you?
Look what this shit do
What this shit do
Look at you
Look at you, and you
Look what this shit do
Look at you, look at him, look at her, look at them
But look at me
