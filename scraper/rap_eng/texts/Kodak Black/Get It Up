All my niggas switching up
Because they seen lil nigga
I'm a star, different cars
I be switching up
Pulled up to spot, dropped my top
Started raining, pull my ceiling up
And nigga I can have all the fucks in the world, I won't give you one
Money standing tall nigga
If your money low better get it up

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm feeling like I'm Diddy
Kodak photogenic
Paparazzi panoramic
I just woke up in a Bentley, Benny pop a wheelie
Christian Loub Bentley Benny's Rollin tailor fitted
Time is money so don't call me, I ran out of minutes
40 to your face, 20/20 vision
Man this here is Prada limit
Yeah my twitter trending
Did I mention I got activist all in my kidneys?
Boy you better get this money
You'll see why I love it
She be giving good brain but that bitch a dummy
I be hopping liking a bunny
Yeah my girlfriend love me
Boy you broke, as a joke man that shit ain't funny

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm fly like Peter Pan
I'm on lean and xan, I'm on Neverland
It's Kodak run and tell a friend!
My plug a Mexican, look at Kodak
Kodak coming with that mess again
Nigga Imma switch it up, windows tinted up
Money out the ass, no if and but
Shooters posted on my porch, I pour a 4
Amusement park how my chain swing back and forth
She tell me she want some more, then bitch get back in line
I'm a sniper, pussy boy you better recognize
Just that nigga, lil ol' nigga with that big ol' 9
Man your pockets touch, you paralyzed

[Hook]
