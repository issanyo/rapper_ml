[Intro]
'Ight, come on
Aye

[Verse 1]
I'm turned up on a jolly
I will milly rock on any block fuckin' Kodak boppin'
I will hit a nigga with that Glock, don't really do no talkin'
I will Diddy bop on any thot, she suck me 'till she coughin'
I will let it rip on all of y'all, just try me bitch I promise
Call me K, I got knowledge, keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be ballin' like Phoenix, but they say I'm hooked on phonic
You won't catch a nigga Tweetin'
I be schemin', I be plottin'
They be leechin', they be watchin'
She be geekin' off the molly
Call me K, I got knowledge
Keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be drippin', I be saucin'
I be limpin' when I'm walkin'
I'm so fucked up in the noggin'
I be hearin' bitches talkin'
Since I'm always fuckin' eatin' yams, wet the cutlass candy
You know I don't fuckin' give a damn, whack you and your mammy
This is orange, don't say tangerine cause I will get offended
I want Actavis Promethazine, don't want that shit you sippin'
And believe me, I ain't conceited
I'm just chillin', I'm just livin'
And so what if I'm conceited? That's just me but that's my business
Remember I was in a sticky one, reality done hit me
Boy these niggas will make you kill some, they always in they feelings
Nigga what would y'all do if you could be me for minute?
Nigga what would God do if we can fuckin' switch positions?
Aye repeat what you just said cause I was rollin' when you told me
Can't believe what you just said, bitch, I be rollin' in a stolen
A lil' soldier from the Noya
I can't stay from off the corner
I don't care none 'bout these foreigns, I'll pull up in a 'Yota
I was raised in a dope hole, posted on the stroll
Put a nigga in a choke hold 'fore I sell my soul

[Verse 2]
Can't keep these bitches off me
Now my bitch think I'm trippin', got her trynna stalk me
Think before I do the shit, false move will cost me
Got plans for tomorrow, been a man in kindergarten
I don't know you bitch, let me get your social
Got a power, stay in Boca and another on commercial
I would rather hit the fuckin' plug before I go commercial
Stop that Tweetin', I'll murk you
I be geekin' like I'm Urkle
Crackers came and got my uncle and he wettin' in December
I'm a come through bouncin' in that orange, you'll think I'm Tigger
Project baby, grew up in the park, you can call me Tigger
It's whatever, I'll rock a fella, and I'm on a jigga
If I ever meet Erykah Badu, I'ma fuck her
If I ever see you, out in public, I'ma touch you
Doin' me, stayin' busta free, I'll bust a busta
In a busted bus, nigga, my interior peanut butter
Shawty said that I'm a kid, prolly is cause I was beatin' her
Prolly not, it prolly is, really think that I'll feed her
I was in the DMV and I was runnin' up the meter
Settin' trends, goin' Super Saiyan, whipped out like Vegeta
In a stolo smokin' reefer, rockin' Polo in Adidas
Ridin' olo with the Nina, I don't know no nigga meaner
