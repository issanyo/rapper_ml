I been through alot in my past
I'm tryna stay levelheaded
I gotta stop movin' soo fast
I don't know where I'm headin'
You don't even answer no more
It seem like you want to be separate
Everybody tellin' me go
I don't know where I'm heading
I gotta keep steppin' on
I gotta, I just gotta keep steppin'
I'm goin' down a yellow brick road
Lately I've been turnin' cold
Every day I'm tryna stay 10 toes down
I'm just tryna stay afloat
In that water tryna not to drown

You know that I got an iPhone...
