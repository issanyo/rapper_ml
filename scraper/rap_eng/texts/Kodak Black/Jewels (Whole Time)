[Intro]
Ay it’s Lil Kodak
Y'all already know that
Young nigga man
For all my young niggas man
I gotta drop jewels on y’all, y’all gotta know that man
These niggas ain’t really fucking with you out here dog
These bitches ain’t really fucking with you out here dog
Shit crazy

[Chorus]
You think these bitches grabbing on you (but they ain’t)
Lowkey they just be grabbing on your cash
You thinking they be laughing with you (but they ain’t)
The whole time they be laughing at your ass
The whole time they was laughing at your boy
Damnit, what done happened to your boy?
The same one who ain’t trapping with your boy
The same one put the rachet on your boy

[Verse 1]
World so cold, go put a jacket on lil boy
You better be ‘bout that action out here boy
I heard you just be flaggin’ out here boy
They say that lil shit you be packin’ just a toy
I pull up, hop out, Aston with two doors
Why you don’t drive the Jaguar anymore?
You sittin’ ‘round, thinking they laughing with you boy
This whole time they be cracking on you
Getting cheese, nigga trapping with you boy
He the same one go to ratting on you
Damnit, what done happened to the man?
Oh I heard he got locked up back again

[Chorus]
You think these bitches grabbing on you (but they ain’t)
Lowkey they just be grabbing on your cash
You thinking they be laughing with you (but they ain’t)
The whole time they be laughing at your ass
The whole time they was laughing at your boy
Damnit, what done happened to your boy?
The same one who ain’t trapping with your boy
The same one put the rachet on your boy
