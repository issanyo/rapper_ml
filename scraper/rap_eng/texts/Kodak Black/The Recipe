[Intro]
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
I be saucin' on these bitches, I’m so smooth
Oh, I got so much rhythm
I’m so saucy

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how I put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor

[Verse 1]
My tongue so powerful I’m killin' em with words
But my gun be still on me while I’m layin' down a verse
Don’t know if I love this mansion or I’d rather be on the curb
Everybody keep bitin' me, they gettin' on my nerves
They lovin' my flavor, it’s delicioso
I hope you love me even though you barely see me no mo'
I don’t need ya beggin' me and eatin' my dough
So if you text me, I don’t reply I’m probably leavin' my show
And, I don’t even drink no lean and sippin' codeine no mo'
Nowadays I just be mixin' coffee with the cocoa
Aye, you can’t drop my style, got a whole ‘nother flow
While you swimmin’ in the money, I just row, row ya boat

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor

[Verse 2]
Swimmin' in the money, I’m a fisherman
Everybody tryna run off with my gingerbread
Niggas say we cousins, I don’t even be knowin' them
Yeah, I tried out ya sauce but you got too much sodium
Got too much sauce, no goulash
In Pluto, smokin' moonrock
Red beam on ya nose like Rudolph
Aye, you should come try my food out
I don’t make no love when I be fuckin'
I don’t even take my shoes off
And with that tool I'ma fool, I knock a nigga screws out
She wanna have my baby, yo' ol' lady love my drip
Even my diamonds drippin' (wet!)
Baby girl don’t slip
Appreciate the fan love and all of the support
They always keep me, so next time I just ain't going to court

[Hook]
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
Y'all don’t know the recipe, how I’m so saucy
They still tryna figure how to put ‘em in a coffin
They want the ingredients, lovin’ my flavor
Swimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor
