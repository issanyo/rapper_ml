[Intro]
You know, me, I ain't doing no Tweetin’ (Glee)
I ain't doin' no Tweetin’
Sniper Gang, Kodak

[Chorus]
I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain’t trippin, I’ma get him when that day come
I'm on house arrest but I’ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain’t say nothin'
I ain't trippin', I'ma get him when that day come

[Verse 1]
I'ma lay on lil' buddy for 'bout eight months
If I whack him now, everybody gon' say somethin'
He tryna cop deuces, I don't tolerate none
He tried to pull up to the corner but he can't come
Yeah, we ran down fooly, he a wankster
He portrayin' to the media he gangsta
That pussy bitin', got me thinkin' about a ring or some'
That pussy bitin', make a nigga wanna sing or some'
Lil' cracker fucked up and then he put a bracelet on
So I'm slidin' in a Tahoe with a ray gun
I'm gettin' the money, I ain't even gotta pay for it
That pussy so good, I give her everything she want

[Chorus]
I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain't trippin, I'ma get him when that day come
I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain't trippin', I'ma get him when that day come

[Verse 2]
Niggas gettin' kidnapped just to show you that it's real
Niggas gettin' snatched, showin' you niggas know right where you live
When you dissin' me, nigga, that better be really how you feel
'Cause I ain't takin' no apologies, I don't care if it's sincere
I'm on 1800 block, still posted with the steel
I don't even care, I got a couple mill' still in the field
I'm a bussiness man, how I give a pussy nigga the deal
Like an engineer, I give a pussy nigga the drill
I be lovin' when we vibin', I be lovin' when we chill
And that pussy so damn good, it make a nigga shed a tear
Slidin' lowkey booted, he a shooter, I recruited him
Better keep that toolie if he move then you shootin' him
Glee

[Chorus]
I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain't trippin, I'ma get him when that day come
I'm on house arrest but I'ma take one
That pussy bitin', so I paid to get her lace done
That nigga dissin' on the 'Gram, but I ain't say nothin'
I ain't trippin', I'ma get him when that day come
