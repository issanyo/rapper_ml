(Intro)
Kodak, boy I keep that shit 1K (all I do is keep that shit 1K)
Kodak, boy I'm ridin' with the K (all I do is ride with the K)
Kodak, boy I'm throwin' up the K (yeah, bitch I slide with it)
Kodak, boy I'm rollin' up the K (yeah, I be rollin' up the K)
You know we out here throwin' up the K
1K....paper chasin' Haitian

(Hook)
Early mornin' on the paper chase (early mornin' on a paper chase)
I'm lookin' for some money once I'm [?]  (lookin' for that money once I'm [?])
Boy you livin' fast you need to [?] (boy you livin' fast you need to [?])
I be tryna slow down but I can't (I be tryna slow down but I can't)
[?] runnin' in your place  ([?] run up in your place)
Call the jury in a pillowcase (get up outta here)
Girl you can't be calling me a snake (girl you can't be calling me a snake)
Lil' shawty wanna see my everyday (shawty wanna see me)

(Verse 1)
I had to put that lil' bitch in her place (I was laid up)
She almost got me caught up with my [?] (I was chained up)
Right there to the [?] on my waist (Now I'm draped up)
Now my wrist wrapped 'round with Cuban links
Early bird gets the worm first, why you always late?
I'm at IHOP sippin' syrup eatin' pancakes
Kodak, why you swimmin' in the money? Boy, you might drown
Got the tool on me right now, it's on me right now
I been making plays up top nigga touchdown
Called the jackboy told him "pack your shit", we goin' out of town
Treat my money like my shoes you know I stack it to a nine
Girl don't call me at this time, niggas gettin' to the guap
Damn!

Boy you livin fast you need to [?] (boy you livin' fast you need to [?])
I be tryna slow down but I can't (I be tryna slow down but I can't)

Girl you can't be calling me a snake (girl you can't be calling me a snake)
Lil' shawty wanna see my everyday (shawty wanna see me)

(Verse 2)
Lil' shawty wanna suck a nigga dry
She ride my dick so hard she made me cry
Got her hands in my pants while I'm drivin' on a [?]
First she was a fan now she wanna love me till I die
Once I wake up in the mornin' I be out here tryna [?]
En route, and I ain't even washed the [?] out my eye
Real life, I don't even stop, I keep goin' straight
Think I'm goin' psycho I'm out here head first like I don't think
Mama said you need a rehab you be feigning for the bank
I shook back and then I realize "tryna quit it but I can't"
Yeah that money keep me geeking you can see it in my eyes
I don't let it go away I just keep chasin' my high
