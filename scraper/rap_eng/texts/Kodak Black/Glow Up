[Verse]
Listen to my lines, taking chances rollin dice
Niggas dammit when they lie, tooking (?) ride
This the way it is . young nigga doing big
Come and run up in your crib
Probably get it how u live
P-Pay attention clothes listen to me till you lose
Nigga this is how we go when we sleeping on the floor
Younging on the store he just hanging and he slaying
And he banging and he dangerous just to staying with the 40

This ey no for gays (?) , boy this shit be crazy
Projekt baby listen to my story
This my story, projekt baby this my story

Pay put your got my OD
My homeboys hating on me low key
Niggas mad they ?religion? wanna feature doe
I dont wanna run no trains you can keep your hoe
False move, I eat you up like a pizza roll
Im sleeping in my cousin room i just need to blow
Im moving forward i swear i ain't looking back no more
One thing get better lil Kodak ain't gotta snap no more
Yea you know i be scooping and pooking your packs when (?)
Can`t wait for when i ain't gotta  (?) 50   packs no more

And i ain't gotta sit up in the trap no more
Couse i dont trap no more
Sniper Gang i ain't gotta to much strap no more
