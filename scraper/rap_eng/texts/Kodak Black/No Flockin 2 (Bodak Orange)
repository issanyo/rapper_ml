[Intro]
Haters so sad
KKK, KKK

[Verse]
Young nigga, I got new money, I got new hundreds
I got old cash, pink 50s, and I got blue hundreds
Toolie go to thumpin', jump out busting, foolie go to running
Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, better go to school or somethin'
Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, little nigga, I shoot for fun
Money moves, these bloody shoes, I'm trippin' Christian Louboutin
Excuse me son, I beg your pardon, get from 'round me, smoking flocka
This is draco, this a baby choppa, I've been so angry doctor
Drop 8 ounces in my baby bottle, baby bottle pop!
I don't Nae Nae, I don't milly rock, baby I just Kodak Bop, I don't do no flock'!
I don't really do no feature, nigga I don't need no swap
I don't eat no broccoli, no mo' 'cause doc I smoked a canteloupe
I'm smoking KK, you smoke BB, I shot Dae Dae with a BB
I'm spazzin' on they asses, flex so much, got muscle spasms
My haters proud of me, 'cause obviously I'm who they trying to be
Make it so damn hard to copy they still try to copy me
Mouth full of gold since 10 years old I hit a lick up top for these
Everybody watchin me, jockin' my flows
Catch 'em out there went and dropped diamond teeth
If they ain't permanent pull 'em out your teeth, hop out with Shotgun Pete
Hoppin' up out the Jeep, hoppin' out, hop, hoppin' out with the heat
Pimpin' bitches, I be trickin' freaks, tricked them for the treat
And I keep a mask on like it's Halloween, er'yday Halloween
C'est La Vie, nigga, what you say about me?
You ain't even in my league
Can't let you intervene, this orange codeine right here, that's yellow lean
Definitely, I can do the beat again and again right now if I please
Cheddar please, I'm 'bout my chedda' cheese, give my cheddar please!
'Specially, I got the melody, I got the recipe
I hop out every scene, I caught no felonies
Fuck a nigga mean?
My bitches yellow, but oranges be fittin' me better, she sweeter than tangerine
Glock 23, came with a drum every gun I got got a tambourine
Orange Balenciaga, I'm so unique, but my swagger mean
Orange Balenciaga, nigga, you can't tell if that disease
I just got these bands for free, poking windows I cut my sleeve
Baby, that's make believe
Maybe that's made with lean
She said, maybe that's Maybelline
Baby, that's made with lean
Jump through your window no trampoline
I be concrete in these skreets
Poke on one, I cut my sleeve
Baby, that make believe
Maybe, that's made with lean
She say, maybe that's Maybelline
Orange soda, that my favorite drink
That my favorite lean
Orange soda, that my favorite drink
That my favorite lean
Orange soda, orange everything, orange everything
Bodak Orange, Kodak anything
Orange everything
Glee, glee
