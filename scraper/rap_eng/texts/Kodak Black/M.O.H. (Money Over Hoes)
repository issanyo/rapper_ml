[Intro]
Money over hoes
Money over bitches
Money on my  mind
Bros over hoes

[Hook]
I be yelling out
Bros over hoes (bros over hoes)
This ain't what I'm about
Money over hoes (that guap)
3 way nigga
I got niggas throwing 4s (3 way 4 way)
I got problems
I got niggas dead and gone (all my niggas)
I got young niggas
Running with the pole (all my young niggas)
Stick and move
You know I'm sticking to the code (stick and move skrt, skrt)
No more knick knock
We kicking down your door (kick your door)
No not baseball
But I run up in your home (not baseball)

[Verse 1]
I'm so cutthroat I will cut you in the throat
Got me fucked up I won't trip about a hoe
I'm a young hustler
Lil Jay Black from Pompano
1800 block
That right there by the hole
I got Haitians who ain't make it
They still tryna get on a boat
I'm still outchea
Tryna stack my bread
Can't let you get a loaf
I would rather go back to selling drugs
I'll never sell my soul
If I ever catch a body I won't never tell a soul
I told my brother that it's time to eat
He went to grab a bowl
Ain't around my way
It's groundhog day
Don't make me wack a mole
Cash rules, I don't break the rules
Because I make the rules
I be taking down your hoe
And now she want some Haitian food
Paper chasing fool

[Hook]
I be yelling out
Bros over hoes (bros over hoes)
This ain't what I'm about
Money over hoes (money over hoes)
3 way nigga
I got niggas throwing 4s (3 way 4 way)
I got problems
I got niggas dead and gone (all my niggas)
I got young niggas
Running with the pole (all my young niggas)
Stick and move
You know I'm sticking to the code (skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt)
No more knick knock
We kicking down your door (no not knick knock)
No not baseball
But I run up in your home (no not baseball)

[Verse 2]
Money over bitches
Mind over matter
Sliding base
Run up in your home
Hey batter batter
I got young niggas on them pills
They really on that shit
And they skipping school
Getting to the loot
Hitting licks
Project baby
Grew up in them bricks
Ain't have a pot to piss
All that starving made me raw for this
I'm tryna live marvelous
Stick and move
I be road running
Boy I love the road
Pillsbury kid
Nigga I can't live without my dough
All you niggas weak
All my niggas solid over here
Remember I used to rock them Dickey fits
Now I rock designer gear
Keep the steel
I was pimping
I will kill Bill
Call me Zephery I'm on a pill
I'm rolling off a hill
Call me Zephyrhills
[Hook]
I be yelling out
Bros over hoes (bros over hoes)
This ain't what I'm about
Money over hoes (money over bitches)
3 way nigga
I got niggas throwing 4s (3 way 4 way)
I got problems
I got niggas dead and gone (zoo life)
I got young niggas
Running with the pole (all my niggas)
Stick and move
You know I'm sticking to the code (finesse)
No more knick knock
We kicking down your door (we finesse)
No not baseball
But I run up in your home
