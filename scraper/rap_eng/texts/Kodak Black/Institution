[Intro]
Institution
Baby girl, damn, yeah, what it is girl
What it is
How you doing? (shit)
I think I wrote you a letter
Send me a kite back
Send me one back asap (asap)
You know you keep a nigga grounded
Man, you keep my head right
For real, I like dat
Look

[Chorus]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse]
I got to write you a kite, I got to keep it real
I don't know when I'm coming home, thats how I really feel
I know its getting to you bad, you probably shedding tears
You hearing rumors, they saying I caught 11 years
I hope you understand, that it's the life I live
And this what come with a street nigga, girl that's what it is
I'm in this situation, but could you love me still?
Cuz I won't change on you, even if I get a record deal
I'ma rip my heart out my chest, put it in this envelope
They got me way in Virginia, with these Virginia folks
Without my momma and my brothers, girl you all I got
And could you send me some pictures? Cuz that would mean a lot
I'm wondering what you doing? And, where the hell you at?
And when I do get back, I hope you where I left you at
And if they send me to jail, would you send me a pack?
I'm in here writing raps, I'm in here getting fat
But one day I'll be back, they can't hold me forever
Okay now write me back, I'm waiting on your letter

[Chorus]
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
What you getting into? Baby who you screwing?
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?
Tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
I'm in institution, tryna to get to you, but I'm in institution
Aye

[Outro]
If I wasn't paper chasin', I'd probably never leave your side
Aye, aye
Institution
