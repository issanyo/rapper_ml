[Intro]
Oh, my bad, I thought that was a freebie
Skrt-Skrt, then I skeet-skeet
See me when you see me

[Chorus]
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt

[Verse 1]
Look, I ain't finna fall for anything, I know my worth
And I ain't finna let you ride my wave because I don't surf
It'll go down any second, you better stay alert
I'ma eat that pussy for breakfast, save room for dessert
I woke up and straight applied pressure out the gate
Nigga, you can't walk a mile in my size 8's
I'm tryna understand why all these niggas hate?
Because I be in my own lane, I'm tryna motivate
I wish I could hold .20 in my .38
But round here we ride 30's fuck them 28's

[Chorus]
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt

[Verse 2]
They say them youngings take something real quick
Lil' nigga I be thuggin, quick to scheme some shit
Baby jump on my dick, I'll run in your shit
I will jump in your shit
I will go in your shit
And now I'm understanding all them people phony
But I can't believe my people put them people on me
I'm geekin', I ain't going to sleep I'm on a monkey
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
My nigga kick your door in, love to kick a door in
I don't wanna go back to scopin', wanna go back to pokin'
I guess I gotta pay for all the shit I did
I guess I can't forget that I was hitting licks
I jumped straight to size seven, I skipped size six
I'm tryna get up out the 'jects, I can't stay out this shit
Gotta stay out this shit
Gotta stay out the mix

[Chorus]
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt
