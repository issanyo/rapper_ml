[Intro]
I'm stuck right now, I'm on my back right now
And then I see you, all fucked up and shit
You know heart problems, surgery and shit
I'm the oxygen and shit
(This temptation shit crazy though)
Shut up and take that deep knee

[Hook]
I'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke
Over here we live in poverty, everybody broke
Over here it ain't no comedy, nah it ain't no joke
We just tryna make it out of it, they hanging us for rope
Never choke, young nigga sellin' dope
Young nigga smokin' poe
Kickin' door, jumped right out the post
Ready to cut your throat
Ready to let em go
Project baby, youngin' on the stroll
Sellin' coke, stressin', man we broke
Doctor check my pulse

[Verse 1]
In this a cold world
It's an icebox that's where my heart beat
I'm the last hope for my hood, I'm they heart beat
I ain't tryna flat line, they won't live without me
Golden acre boy free my nigga Greg Roundtree
Niggas played me dirty
Bitches played me dirty
Your niggas and your bitches, they'll leave you hurtin'
I just want a better life, I know I deserve it
The hood on life support and it's real urgent
And I'm fucked up bad, I need a real surgeon
Why they do ya boy bad? I'm a good person
I'm the one who gon' ride out like a derby
If you my nigga imma slide out with you lurkin'
Dye your nose, paranoia I be gettin' nervous
Had to wait the fourth quarter, I ain't have a jersey
Niggas dying everyday can't behave they self
Before you jump off the porch nigga take a step
(Nigga slow down)
I was just a litttle boy, had to raise myself
I was movin' too fast, had to pace myself
Paper chasin for that cash tryna race myself
You know a nigga like to spaz, had to take a breath
Sometimes I think I'm too much for myself
And I done cost a lot of hurt to my health
It'll make a nigga cry, all the pain I felt
While everybody fold up, I remain myself

[Hook]
I'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke
Over here we live in poverty, everybody broke
Over here it ain't no comedy, nah it ain't no joke
We just tryna make it out of it, they hanging us for rope
Never choke, young nigga sellin' dope
Young nigga smokin' poe
Kickin' door, jumped right out the post
Ready to cut your throat
Ready to let em go
Project baby, youngin' on the stroll
Sellin' coke, stressin, man we poor
Doctor check my flow
