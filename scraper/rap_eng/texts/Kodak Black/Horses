[Intro: PnB Rock]
DJ Chose
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)
One false move, that could be my last (yeah)
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)
Going so fast, hope I don't crash (skrr, skrr)
One false move, that could be my last (yeah)

[Verse 1: PnB Rock]
I just pulled up in the Benz
It was just me and my mans
Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles

[Bridge: PnB Rock]
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast
Young nigga, I just wanna do the dash
I'm so reckless, hope I don't crash
'Cause I'm ballin', like the whip stolen (yeah)

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast

[Verse 2: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas (skrr, skrr)

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind

[Chrous: PnB Rock]
All these horses in my car got me going fast
