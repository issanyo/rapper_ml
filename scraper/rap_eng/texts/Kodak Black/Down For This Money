They used to try and shit on me-eee x2
They wasn't friends, they was my enemies
They wasn't down only pretend to be
I remember i remember x2

(Hook Prince Track)
I can't let my pocket touch no i gotta make a way
And you gotta watch out for all these snakes they in your face
Im 10 toes. Down for this money x2

I ont trust a nigga no friends no homies
Im 10 toes. Down for this money x2

(Verse 1 Kodak Black)
Lil nigga foreign whippin
Diamond glistening in the building they rocking polo linen
Boy im all about them dollar bills just call me Clinton
I was drinkin Remi now you see me codeine sippin

Panaremi creepin in the jag, widows tinted

I remember that they ain't fuck with black, ain't have no money
They was sinnin on me they was eatin on me, i was hungry

Thought that was my dog, i swear i used to treat him like Beethoven

(Hook Prince Track)
I can't let my pocket touch no i gotta make a way
