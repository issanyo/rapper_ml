[Intro: Project Pooh]
Project Pooh

[Verse 1: Project Pooh]
All my niggas rollin', ain't no cruise controllin'
Shooter in the back, quick to pull a strap
You gone get your issue, bless you with a tissue
Ain't no Stuart Little, you a rat we get you

[Verse 2: Mr Flippa]
I'm rollin' on a bean, in my Robin jeans
Infrared beam, I'll clear the scene
.40 with a long dick, nah mean
Your body flinchin' and jumpin' like a trampoline

[Verse 3: Project Pooh]
Mr came off of some bicycles, ain't cappin'
Keep that dog food in the cabs, y'all niggas still trappin'
Them blogs sometimes they make me crazy how they spin bendin'
Always up post on the block, don't never see me bended

[Verse 4: Kodak Black]
1800 block, is you out or is you in it
Cause I don't know no different, nigga you out here set trippin'
Sniper Gang, nigga I don't know no other thing
I'll kill your brother, yea I'm Suge Knight to this money thing
[?] smokin' Double D fourty
Early morning, no more sellin' morphine
Scopin' and pokin' on a journey

[Verse 5: Project Pooh]
No Dora the Explorer, my snipers gonna come and swipe you for them packs
I remember busta' busta' licks was comin' back
On them mollies yea them jiggas can't even sleep
My phone jumpin' like a pair of retro Jordan sneaks

[Verse 6: Mr Flipper]
She suck my dick you kiss that bitch, nutty buddy
That's your dawg, but you told on your buddy
I remember bustin' licks on the Huffy
I keep that Pedigree, I got to feed my puppies
I got dog food, call it pedigree
What you wanna do, I got siblings to feed
Ain't no dividends
Ain't no Skippa da Flippa
Mr Flipper gonna rip you
Hit you with the whippers
.45 fuckin' clip
With them extra dicks
I got dirty sticks
Whole lot of .30 clips
Yea we Z'd up, that's the mafia
We la familia, don't play with the loyalty

[Verse 7: Kodak Black]
Make sure my niggas commissary straight
Make sure my niggas commissary straight, pay all they lawyer fees
Yea this shit right here means way so much more to me
Blood on my rosary, blood in my pupils
That shit didn't even hit the news bruh
Sniper Gang, I'm a sniper not a shooter
Slidin' with that Ruger, if he dissin' hallelujah
And I'm pipin' down a cougar, she said stop Kodak you too young
And my plug from Tokyo his same is Su Yung
I can get it for the low but I ain't got coupons

[Outro: Kodak Black]
I don't use them, I make music and I do fraud
I go yesterday, you go tomorrow
I'm the reason they ain't listen to your new song
She said why everytime you fuck you got your shoes on
