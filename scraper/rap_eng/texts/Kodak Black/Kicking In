[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And twelve of us, I'm recordin' myself
Fuck it let the beat rock
Just please don't let the beat stop
And you don't even need to knock
I don't care if it never drop

[Verse 1]
Just felt my heartbeat
Just felt my heartbeat
Just felt my heartbeat
Cause I'm heart of the projects
I was baptized on the block
No more orange pop, I'm drinkin' holy water
I could've swore I felt somethin' beat in me
I run away from love when it get too deep
I'm scared to love you back 'cause I might love too deep
I don't wanna love you, girl, 'cause I won't love you deep
Valentine, packin' 9, my lady want a dinner date
I ain't have no time so I just took the bitch to Steak 'n Shake
The beat it got me in my feelings, vibin' to the rhythm
My ears a symphony but I don't show no sympathy
Don't let 'em kill your self esteem, they tryna kill your dignity
Niggas out here gamblin' wit they lives for some publicity
Damn, left my heart in these streets, I left the trick to treat
I'm scarred, lost my conscience to the block, it's feelin' good to sleep
And I don't need no court sentence
I love this beat so much I hope the Lord in it
Dreads in my head and they look like Devil horns in it
All my niggas be up in the business like them dorks in it
Drippin' on 'em, like a dinosaur I be so vintage
Drippin, you can't get these in the store, yeah I'm so different
My clothes and my hoes different
These days I don't know what I'm spendin'
These days I don't know what I'm gettin'
I got blood on my Givenchy
Video vixen, so much bitches, these days I don't know who I'm hittin'
I don't even know what I'm sippin', I just know it's kickin' in
Holler if you feelin' it
Lovin' and I'm thuggin' 'cause they both go hand in hand
Thuggin' cross the country, from the US to Switzerland
Booted like Shaquille O'Neal
You know the deal, I'm on the pill
I just tucked the .32 right in my Timberland
Holler if you feelin' it
That jigga kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Ain't got no-kickin' in
Holler if you feelin' it
At the Last Supper got my plate first
At the Last Supper I got my plate first
I ain't got no feelings
