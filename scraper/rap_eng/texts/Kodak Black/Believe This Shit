[Intro: Kodak Black]
Aye I don't pour that liquor on the floor, I pour it down the drain
Down the sink for my dawgs who in hell and who in jail to drink
You feel me?
Nah mean, nah sayin'
Nah talm' 'bout

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit yea
I ain't gonna lie I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Never thought I could make it out the PJs, I was just robbin' with DJ
Shout out to my niggas who in Hell right now
And to my dawgs who ain't got release dates
I was doin' fraud way in D.C, I was doin' fraud way in Chesapeake
Ain't nobody wonder about my CD, I was breakin' and enterin' B and E
Mama always see me on TV, 'cause I hit the news, I was 15
Now she can see me on VH1, shit ain't a game, this shit ain't fun
To all the kids who look up to me, shit ain't a game, this shit ain't fun
Niggas want beef we serve they lunch, we been on the run like six to eight months

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell, wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Kickin' in doors, Me, Moopa, and Lil' Wiz
They just pick my dawg up for attempt
They just pick my dawg up for a murder one
My dawg got killed while I was doin' a bid
We just talked a day before the shit
And he wanted to talk to me again
And now I never know what he wanted to say to me
If I say my dawg in Heaven that would be make believe
I know my grandma made it in Heaven, say a grace for me
Now I'm gettin' all this cake, I could open a bakery

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I ain't gonna lie I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't never thought it could be like this yea
I ain't gonna lie, I ain't even believe in me back then yea
My people who in Hell wish you could see this shit yea
I give it all up to try it again so y'all could see this shit
