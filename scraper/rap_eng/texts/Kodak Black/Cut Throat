[Intro: Kodak Black]
I had to snatch my golds out you know what I'm saying and go diamonds
Shawty said I look like I got Plies teeth
Pussy ahh hoe every nigga in Florida got permanent golds

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I just want to win and see all my niggas win
My nigga lost his trial, asked God why he ain't win
I'm sliding in a Fin-Fin with a FN
AC pipping, windows crossed up behind tint
My eyes on the prize, interstate 95
Yellow brick road but my rims gold
Yellow brick road trynna make it home
Went 95
You know how it go, I ain't flipping french fries
I got checkbooks, got that work but no 9-5
Drive through with that big mac on the passenger side
Big Mac to your face, kill a nigga appetite
What's the point of going to college just to serve apple pies

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm the best because I beat the best, David and Goliath
Before the show money, I was grinding in Fort Myers
5.95, kicking doors in Pembroke Pines
Finessing all my life, all I know is slang that iron
She said that I look like Plies, so I put diamonds in my mouth
These permanents, just like them tears in your mama eyes
When you die nigga, I hope she tired of crying nigga
I got 7 now, I remember I had 5 figures
Yea, that's your main bitch I'm just a side nigga
I fucked that bitch bare than I prayed about it
I snucked that nigga bare than I prayed about it
Free Lil Soto, they accusing him for 3 bodies
I did my [?], I skeeted off and popped 3 mollies
A nigga just died last night
I was way in Georgia on a flight
I’m fuckin’, I ain’t takin’ off my Nikes
I'm fucking I ain't cutting off the lights
I'm cut throat but I ain't running with a knife
Boy it’s on sight, Sniper Gang call me Wesley Snipes
Wedding band ring, married to the game throwing rice

[Hook: Kodak Black]
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
I said I wasn't gonna sin again Lord but I did
I said I wasn't gonna fuck that bih no more but I did
Started with a QP then got a pound for two bands
Hit a lick in a Q-50, sliding in a Fin
