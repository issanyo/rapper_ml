[Verse 1: Plies]
She asked me was the pussy good, I told her it was bootah
Asked me what my profession is, I told her I'm a shooter
Detective want to question me, I ain't talking to you
Better keep your bit from round me cause I'm a run through her
Anytime some suckas around, I don't speak no english
Stay up out my game room bitch and mind your business
I don't kick no bullshit with you bustas, I ain't friendly
I just get the bag and lay low, I be chilling
I got to be more careful with the dick, she in her feelings
If your lil ass a hunnid, guess what I'm a trillion
Ion do no squashing, none no capping, none no snitching
Cross your ass over with the bag, I'm like Pippen
I don't do no First 48, I don't talk to them
Pay my lawyer good bih, I do not consult with them
My conversation is my patience, my shit real short with them
Ion speak no english bih, that's how I talk to them

[Hook: Plies]

I don't speak no english
I don't speak no english bih
I don't speak no english
I don't speak no english bih
I don't speak no english
I don't speak no english bih
I don't speak no english
I don't speak no english bih
I don't speak no english
