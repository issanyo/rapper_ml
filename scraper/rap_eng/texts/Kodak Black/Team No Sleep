Team no sleep (Late Night)
Team no sleep (and Early Morning)
Mama told me get it, got to pay the lease (She Depending on Me)
Lil Cousin say he want them J's on his feet (I got to get it for him)
I'm so money hungry, man I got to eat (And I ain't Never snorin')
Team no sleep (Late Night)
Team no sleep (and Early Morning)
Mama told me get it, got to pay the lease (She Depending on Me)
Lil Cousin say he want them J's on his feet (I got to get it for him)
Either wind or Sunny, ya I never sleep (And I ain't Never snorin')

[Verse 1 : Kodak Black]
I never sleep, I'm going through insanity
I say Im gon' be my hero for my family
Ain't nobody help me out I did it manually
Like, Why these crackers always gotta shackle me?
I be Polo'd down, yeah I kill them casually
Charge them double, man they dead like my battery
As you see, I be flexin like an athlete
Crook hit the castle, now I feel majestique
Never sleep fuck a canopy, get that celery
Get that cheese by myself, cuz these niggas'll rat on me
Fifteen hunnid but im finna wear some three
Kodak paint a picture for you, I will write a masterpiece

[Verse 2]
I dont [?] insomnia just mentally
I'm wondering like what the fuck got into me
And why these niggas faking like they friends of me
But seriously, homie is you kiddding me?
I control your mind girl, but physically but
You can't call my line, like my minutes free
It's like playing around with fire don't get in to deep
Yeah, you can't get my time, but you can get the D

Get a [?] cuz I been had went and got the streets
Heart cold, but I'm still running with my heat
Twinkle Twinkle, I'm a star so I never sleep
Fuck a pillow, Im that nigga, fuck a sheet
