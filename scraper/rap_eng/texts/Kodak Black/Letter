[Intro: Kodak Black]
Nah
What they did right there
Nah, let me see that
(Nah, that's just-)
Who that from, right there?
Yahhh, my nigga!
That real

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Just got a letter from my nigga
I grabbed the top and I ripped it
Two pages front and back
I read them and started grinnin'
Wonderin' how I'm doin'
He like, "Lil bruh, how you feelin'?"
Told me shit ain't the same without me, the streets miss me
He hate the situation I'm in, he say I'm trippin'
Just got out of the county, they tried to send him to prison
Just talked to his P.O. and he still facin' a sentence
While he was writin', he was blowin' kush and drinkin' Remy
He lookin' at my pictures right now, he in his feelins'
Just tryna bounce back, but other than that he chillin'
Tellin' me how his dog went down and went to snitchin'
Damn, that shit crazy cause we in the same position
Say he remember them times goin' on them missions
Say he for real, he really do, he reminiscin'
He out there making moves, then get caught up with the swivelin'
Everything going smooth and you just get caught slippin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
This shit a lesson for you breh, you better pay attention
When you get out, Kodak, stay focused and keep spittin'
Bruh, you remember that hoe you was fuckin' with, Lil Vicky?
Man, I hear she fuck with some nigga from Khia City
When you think about it, I ain't seen you in a minute
I hope when I get out we could ride around the city
I'm in Tallahassee right now, I'm with Lil Ricky
I'm tryna stumble across a little play, I'm just livin'
Just do your time and don't be worried about these bitches
I'm here for you, anything you need, breh, just hit me
Your brother just told me you hopped on a plea for three
But everybody sayin' you caught eleven years, G
I'm doin' good nigga, how about you?
I had to send a kite cause that's what real niggas do
You my lil nigga forever, just keep your head up
And write me back ASAP, soon as you get this letter
