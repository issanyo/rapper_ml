[Intro]
20-year-old Kodak Black, real name is Dieuson Octave was arrested last night after an incident at his Pembroke Pines-
Rapper Kodak Black locked-
On parole right now-
And is unclear at this hour what's gonna happen with Kodak Black-

[Chorus]
You my girl, you my shorty
If I call on you, know you fallin' through shortly
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you are me
I wanna be down with you, baby, like you owe me
Is you makin' time for me, baby, like my Rollie?
I want you to ride for me, baby, like my woadies

[Verse 1]
And I goin' lie, I can't even focus
Lately I been stackin' all this paper like it's poison
Sniper Gang 'till I die, nigga, I ain't gonna forfeit
She just want for me to come and paint her like a portrait
She just want for me to put her up like she a trophy
Sellin' white girl, sellin' So, call it Sophie
Runnin' game like it's poetry
Young nigga chargin' to the game like a mophie
She FaceTimein' with a mean mug
Took her out a Punch Buggy, put her in a Beamer
My bitch name Tina but she bad like she Trina
I'm doin' me, drinkin' Tequila, smokin' sativa
I make time cause you my baby
Just like I'm bustin' out a AP
I make time cause you my baby
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Feel like I'm bustin' out of AP
Keep me on hard
You make me go the hardest
Don't matter I fall
Pull up when you call me
When I'm behind bars, I be facin' charges
You the one I call, cause you keep it solid
You know I'm a catch you when you fallin'
Remember I used to have you in the projects
You gone fall through just like it's August
So I'ma pick up when you call me
You the reason I ain't go insane yet
You the reason I ain't lose my brain yet
You the reason why I stay sane
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the pain
I'm poppin' out wit' you to hide the shame
I never need a pill for the pain
You gon' fall through so I'll a make sure that you flyer than a plane
You gon' fall through so I make sure that you main squeeze
I had to make sure you my main thing
You gon' fall through so I pick up when you ring me
Late nights in the Noya
Flexin' in a Jag, hittin' licks in a 'Yota
That's the only reason that I had the 'Yota
She was fuckin' with me, I was with her way before her
When I was kicking doors and I was whippin' up the soda
Whippin' up the soda, you can call me Coca-Cola
She my Soulja
You my girl, you my shorty
If I call you know you fallin' through shortly
You gonna pull up like the Marshalls
Sniper Gang land on a nigga with binoculars
Pullin' up like on holiday we sittin' with the chopper
Holiday season we gon' ball like its Hanukkah
I'm married to this shit so sit back and get comfortable
Mama call me Bill cause we livin' like the Huxtable
I just wanna be down, wanna be down like you hold me

[Outro]
Make time like you my Rollie
Is you gonna ride like my woadie
