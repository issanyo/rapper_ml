[Verse 1]
Name another young niggah flexing like this, just be honest
And I wanna see that check so take ya time and thank about it
Me and jack boy like Batman and Robin, We balling
Like the Phoenix Suns you scrubs hooked on phonics
Take yo shoes off hoe this an antique carpet
Now I got my brother David sitting around like Harding
Im thorough bred lil nigga from the projects
Ain't nothing but a ratchet ass lil nigga and i can't hide it
Im wilding I'm poking houses too, Im a Haitian boy I got zombies in my crew
My momma playing with fire don't get caught up with it woop
Like the designer on my body Im so True
No paper no pen I'm just vibing
Just press record and go ahead and let me slide in
Man That bentley stretch so long that I can't drive it
Say Kodak Black can't rap he only rhyme when he on them Mollys
You can tell I'm from the Noya don't need no scientist
I be polo to the floor don't need no stylist
Imma whip that cutlass when i blow don't need no rarri
Im going scotty oh Kimo Sabe
Say recess i don't play around with them ben
Shouts out my cuz St Louis he around
Imma put that dope on burners I don't need no lamb
Peanut butter jelly i was stuck off in a jam

[Verse 2]
My girl so wet she soaking like a faucet
My pack so stank think my plug came out the garbage
And i can't tell no lie boy I'm just being honest
Paparazzi Kodak trending topic
Imma pull up in that ghost I feel like Casper
Rock n Roll Kodak Mick Jager
Im a lock-n-load and aim it right at ya
Call it NASA
When I see you ima blast off
Smoking loud in public where my manners?
Run in ya home hey batter batter
All these Mollys messing up my bladder
Niggas hustling backwards
Got off my ass and i got them racks up
OG Kush i roll it in a backwood
I went and copped the Range cause i cracked the last truck
Nigga when i see you you better not act up

I just bought my bitch a MacBook
