[Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

[Verse 1]
I'm trying to figure out who want to see me winning
I already know resentment brings envy
I'm a business man I'm a fucking business
So I can't be up in the penitentiary
And I just wanna be able to tell who really with me
Is she for me or is she just playing with my feelings
And I don't want to but I gotta switch up
Cause you niggas want to have me locked up in the system
Even though that's who I am I gotta change my life
I'm getting so much money now I can't be slinging iron
And girl when we hooked up you said you gon ride or die
So I'm assuming that you dead cause you damn sure ain't riding

[Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me

[Verse 2]
I went to jail twelve times I'll never go again
Even though I said the same thing my other bid
Everybody stopped fucking with me cause I keep going in
And I'm feeling like Ben Franklin my only friend
Cause that nigga kept it real stayed in my pocket
He was with me when y'all weren't fucking with me in the projects
Is you in it for the fame or do you really like me?
It's hard to tell when I got five mill in the Breitling
I know you don't want to but you gotta change your surroundings
Cause them niggas don't want to change all they know is violence
I'm a sniper you know all my niggas move in silence
I'm trying to balance out my life I'm doing mathematics

[Hook]
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me
