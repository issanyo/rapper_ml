[Intro]
Ayy, Ben, I always call you when I need a hit, man
I call you when I need to roll one
I call you when I need to roll one
You call me when you need to hold something

[Verse 1]
You only call me when you need a loan
And I'm only talkin' murder on my other phone
She be right here like she post to
And I'm havin' ruffles on my shoulder
You know I love to shine, so my gun plated gold
You havin' your high, got me on my tippy toes
I'm already zombie, I ain't gotta sell my soul, baby
Own a mansion now, my last home done got old
I be totin' a pole, I'm pourin' a four, I'm rollin' up mold
Flyer than these niggas, man, niggas be flyin' cold
And I'm takin' money with the dope now
I promise I'm a junkie on the dope now
Takin' Molly got me takin' souls
Takin' Mollys fucked me up, I know
I know I'm a zombie on Earth, I'm a Zoe
And I'm bringin' hell on Earth for these hoes
You my heaven on Earth, you my H.O.E baby
I love my old girl, I love my old lady
Lookin' in my rear view, I ain't paranoid, I'm on point
In the club with twenty of my niggas but I'm on one
She said, "Kodak, is you flyer than my nigga?" uh huh
Police asked if I know what happened to that nigga, uh uh
They like, "Really? It ain't none of your goddamn business, noneya"
You niggas got the same drip, I'm drippin' custom
Kill a nigga broad daylight just because
Kill a nigga right in public 'bout my brothers
I don't play no games, you could miss me with the fun
'Cause I got a AR-15 in the trunk
Lil' nigga, but I'm big like I'm Pun
I parked the Wraith, then I pulled up in a Dawn
Sniper Gang Taliban, I'm a junkie
Remember hittin' stores, hidin' in a dungeon
Jump out with my orange ski mask like I'm pumpkin
I run out on you faggot ass niggas, y'all be punkin'
Even though I'm little, I be makin' big boy moves
They know that I'm little, so I got a lot to prove
I done transformed from that nigga to that Woo
Talkin' 'bout me I'm gon' need you on the news

[Verse 2]
[?] marinate one more again
Talkin' 'bout that I'm 'gon need you on a T-shirt
That money talk, you niggas teeth hurt
I'm gon' need you on a T-shirt, yeah
Molly pink on it, yuh
My momma call Bill, I kill to pay the bills, I swear
My momma named me Jason, see me in your sleep, nightmare
My family called me God's son, 'cause I'm gon' need bloodshed
Yeah, I'm gon' need your whole head
'90s baby, I ain't got no respect for the old heads
Sniper Gang, most of my niggas done gone fed
I ain't Tweetin', pussy nigga, I know you scared
Catch me slidin' in the decoy, fuck a Maybach
She said, "Do you fuck with D-Boy?" that was way back
I split yo' wig, I put your top right where your tape at
I'm 'bout that gun play, got a AK in the Maybach
I lost my homie to a gunman
I lost my other homie 'cause I found money
I'm SG, 13 is done with
I'm jumpin' out the [?], I got done with it
