[Hook]
I be makin' moves with my wrists
I can make the news with my wrists
I'm a Koley Imma swang with my wrists
I got my Roley on a plane on my wrist
Shoulda seen it be poppin' like some bacon
Like a day care im whippin up a baby
How I make it lock up they can't sake it
Pillsberry kid I'm in here goin' crazy
On my wrists
My wrists [x3]
Damn I love my wrists [x2]

[Verse 1]
I be walkin' round with forties on my hip
I'm bout to throw some forgies on my whip
Kiss on her come get shorty out my shit
She in here recording me and shit
Hit the drive thru up I told em order me a brick
I got tired of eating Pork n Beans and shit
Called me Pootie Tang gah damn stankin up my profit
Albert Einstein I re-rock it and sock it
I will turn up on you anytime take off like a rocket
I don't want you playing with my mind
I feel like I'm gothic
They say Kodak he ain't got no mind
We thank he retarded
Me metarded boy you just fine
You is out the pockets
We ain't never had a damn dime
I came up off the faucets
Used to dream about it all the time
I'm gon' work that Pyrex

[Hook]
I be makin' moves with my wrists
I can make the news with my wrists
I'm a Koley Imma swang with my wrists
I got my Roley on Bang on my wrist
Shoulda seen it be poppin' like some bacon
Like a day cow whippin up a baby
How I make it lock up they can't sake it
Pillsberry kid I'm in here goin' crazy
On my wrists
My wrists [x3]
Damn I love my wrists [x2]

[Verse 2]
Damn I think I got a motor on my wrist
My cup can drink in water like a fish
Lets talk [?] man Si habla espanol Pablo that cocaine
We get it
That dope don't lock niggas scratch that pot then spin it
We win it
See them broke niggas make jokes
Y'all fuck niggas grin it
My mind on a milli
My nine is a semi
No time to be friendly
I want every gah damn dime
Cuz the mind to the pennies
In the lab like a chemist
Pushing weight like fitness
It's first down on the line in the scrimmage
Nigga we winners

[Hook]
I be makin' moves with my wrists
I can make the news with my wrists
I'm a Koley Imma swang with my wrists
I got my Roley on Bang on my wrist
Shoulda seen it be poppin' like some bacon
Like a day cow whippin up a baby
How I make it lock up they can't sake it
Pillsberry kid I'm in here goin' crazy
On my wrists
My wrists [x3]
Damn I love my wrists [x2]
