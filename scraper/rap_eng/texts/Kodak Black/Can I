[Intro: Kodak Black]
Yeah
This my shit right here
This my kinda shit right here
Y'all know me, the son

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
See my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine
None of this shit just fall from the sky
I'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Can a nigga eat in peace?
You leechin' for a crumb
Niggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from
Them people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya
