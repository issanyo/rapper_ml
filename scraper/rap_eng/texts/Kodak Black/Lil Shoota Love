[Hook: Kodak Black & Mr. Flipper]
Low-key in a rental getting Higher
We low-key shawty living for them snipers
My lick just hit my line and said she want 30 delighters
Nah I ain’t got no products except sniper gang designer
My metro boomin, dynamite
I’m hitting them bricks with a rocket, left right
Everything I bust down I’m tryna double twice
Come short on that money I’m on your head like lice
I’m throwing slugs he catching them, jerry rice
I can’t let go of this money I feel like Barry White
I done proposed to the dough will you be my wife
And now I’m married to the hoe got me throwing rice

[Mr. Flipper]
Sorry baby you can’t be my wife
I don’t fuck in the dark I fuck in the light
Beating that pussy like turner, ima Ike
Ohh you eating that dick good like some mike and ikes

[Kodak Black]
I don’t take my shoes off
Fucking with my Nike’s
We gonna have a shootout right after we fight
Diamonds hit the strobe light
I’ve been up for four nights
Niggas getting drilled in the field why you brought a knife
You a Instagram bully i don’t side with em
I ain’t looking for that nigga but imma find him
My nigga say you sweet, Willy Wonka
Ain’t no new nigga around here fuck a posse
