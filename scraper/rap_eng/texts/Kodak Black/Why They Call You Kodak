[Intro]
Alright, the name Kodak Black! How'd you get the name Kodak Black? How'd you get the name Kodak Black?
I mean, it's a lotta ways I could explain it. You know what I'm sayin'?
Brrr, glee, Sniper Gang, ayy
I say, "Man, you gotta let me in the club with my Ruger, man, you got to"

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm on probation, but I'm slidin' and not even 'posed to be out
But I'm lurkin', tryna come see what your press about
See, when it's 'bout me, I'ma slide, run in yo' hive
See, when it's 'bout me, niggas die, 'cause I'm in my prime
I ain't got no time to do no beefin', like I'm a vegan
See when it's pressure, I ain't sleepin', I ain't doin' no tweetin'
And I'll violate to get a pussy nigga straight
And when I pull up, when I'm bussin', that shit out the gate
And I don't leave no shells around with my thirty-eight
And I ain't wearin' a suit, but I'll catch me another case
I ain't no engineer, but I got that toolie on me bih
And when I'm in the club, I got that Ruger on me bih

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga

[Verse 2]
I shoot a pussy nigga like I'm doin' a film
I don't lay up, I cross up like I'm in the gym
I got my shooters with me posted with me under the rim
I got my sniper on the bleacher, you don't even see him
I got a Beamer, but I'm slidin' late night in the Kia
And I ain't playin' football, but I'm really in the field
And Lil' Kodak, I be flashin', I'm scared of snappin'
And I ain't doin' a show if I can't come in with my ratchet
A nigga ever snatch my chain, I'ma stop rappin'
These niggas don't really be 'bout the issue, they just be cappin'
I ain't no engineer, but I got that toolie on me bih
And when I'm in the club, I got that Ruger on me bih

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga
Everywhere I go, I got my shooters with me
I ain't goin' in the club, can't bring my Ruger in it
Ain't no cameraman, but I'll shoot a nigga
Now why they call me Kodak? 'Cause I'll shoot a nigga

[Outro]
I mean, it's a lotta ways I could, I could explain it. You know what I'm sayin'? I be livin' for the moment. Yeah, I could explain it that way. That's some fly shit. I think. I ain't no cameraman though, but I'll shoot a nigga. I just thought of that, really. People be asking me that question, in this shit. That's my new answer
