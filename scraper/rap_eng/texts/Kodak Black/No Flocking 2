Ain’t that so sad KKK yea KKK
Young nigga I got new money
I got new hunnid
I got old cap
Pink 50’s and I got blue hunnid
Toolie go to thumpin’,  jump out bustin’
Foolies go to runnin’
Boy don’t play wit me
Ion play wit kids
Better go to school or sum
Boy don’t play wit me
Ion play wit kids
And nigga I shoot for fun
Money moves, these bloody shoes
I’m trippin’ Christian Louboutin
Excuse me son,  I beg your pardon
Get from round me, smoke a flock
This a draco, this a baby chopper
I’ve been so angry docta’
Drop 8 ounces in my baby bottle
Baby bottle pop!
Ion nae nae, Ion milly rock
Baby I just Kodak Bop, Ion do no flock
Ion really do no feature
Nigga Ion need no swap
Ion eat no broccoli no mo
Cause doc I smoked a cantaloupe
I’m smoking KK
You smoke BB
I shot Dae Dae wit a BB
I’m spazzin’ on their asses fast
So much got muscle spasms
My haters proud of me
Cause obviously I’m who they tryna be
Make it so damn hard to copy
They still try to copy me
Mouth full of gold since ten years old
I hit the nigga up top for me
Everybody watching me
Jockin my flows
Catch em’ out there
Went and dropped diamond teeth
If they ain’t permanent
Pull em’ out your teeth
Hop out wit Shotgun Pete
Hoppin’ up out the Jeep
Hoppin’ out, hop
Hoppin’ out wit the heat
Pimpin’ bitches
I be trickin’ freaks
Tricked them for the treat
And I get a mask on like it’s Halloween
Erryday’ Halloween, C’est La Vie
Nigga whatchu said bout me
You ain’t even in my league
Can’t let you intervene
This orange codeine right here
That’s yellow lean
Definitely
I can do the beat again and again
Right now, if I please
Cheddar please
I’m bout’ my chedda’ cheese
Give my chedda’ please
‘Specially
I got the melody
I got the recipe
I hop out every scene
I caught no felonies
Fuck a nigga mean
My bitches yellow
But oranges be fittin’ me better
She sweeter than tangerine
Got 23, came wit a drawn heavy
Gun cocked like I got a tambourine
Arms Balenciaga
I’m so unique
But my swagger mean
Arms Balenciaga
Nigga you can’t tell if that is me
I just got these bands for free
Poking one as I cut my sleeve
Baby, that’s make believe
Maybe that’s made wit lean
She say, maybe that’s Maybelline
Baby that’s made wit lean
Tramp do you wanna lil trampoline
I be concrete in these skreets
Poke on one, I cut my sleeve
Baby, that’s make believe
Maybe that’s made wit lean
She say, maybe that’s Maybelline
Orange soda, that’s my favorite drink
That’s my favorite lean
Orange soda, that my favorite drink
That my favorite lean
Orange soda
Orange everything, orange everything
Boi that’s orange
Kodak anything
Orange everything
Glee
