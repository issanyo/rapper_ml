[Intro]
Boy, you ain't never sell no work, ayy
Sniper Gang, boy, I got that shit on lock

[Chorus]
Ayy, you ain't never sold  no work
How I skrrt skrrt, when I pull up in that vert, ayy
Ayy, you ain't never sold no rock
How I drop the top, when I pull up in that drop, uh
Uh, you ain't never snatched no car
I ain't livin' hard, when I jump out with that rod
Uh, you ain't never pulled no caper
How I'm gettin' paper, when I jump out with that banger

[Verse 1]
They like dang player, do your thing player
Get that money, I be road runnin'
Call it Mickey D's 'cause I love it
Like a fuckin' safe, how I got this shit on lock
They know I'm Sniper Gang so I keep this shit on lock
And I'm solo ridin' in a stolen ride to that guap
You ain't certified, nigga, you can't post up on my block
Got the forty Glock cocked back, I be ready to pop
And my pocket look like a pregnant lady, like she ready to pop
You ain't never hit no fuckin' lick, you ain't got no bread
All my niggas be on go, they act like they ain't got no head
Like my bitches red, money same color as a pool
You a damn fool, how you outchea, you ain't got no loot?

[Chorus]
Ayy, you ain't never sold no work
How I skrrt skrrt, when I pull up in that vert, ayy
Ayy, you ain't never sold no rock
How I drop the top, when I pull up in that drop, uh
Uh, you ain't never snatched no car
I ain't livin' hard, when I jump out with that rod
Uh, you ain't never pulled no caper
How I'm gettin' paper, when I jump out with that banger

[Verse 2]
How I skeet skeet on your ass, pull out with that bag
They like damn Black, why I never see you drive the Jag'?
Ayy, ayy, you ain't never slang that iron
How I'm on the grind, I got blood in my eyes
I got VVS's on my chains, ridin' with your main
Why you on the corner, nigga, you ain't never sold no yay?
And they call me Bill, 'cause I'm all about a dollar
I ain't sellin' makeup, but you know I got that product
You could call me Brady, 'cause that money I got a bunch
What's up with yo lady? Shawty said she want a hunch
I be sneakin' dog, I be geekin' dog, like an armadillo
Like a fuckin' lizard, nigga, I be creepin' for that skrilla

[Chorus]
Ayy, you ain't never sell no work
How I skrrt skrrt, when I pull up in that vert, ayy
Ayy, you ain't never sell no rock
How I drop the top, when I pull up in that drop, uh
Uh, you ain't never snatched no car
I ain't livin' hard, when I jump out with that rod, nigga
Uh, you ain't never pull no caper
How I'm gettin' paper, when I jump out with that banger
