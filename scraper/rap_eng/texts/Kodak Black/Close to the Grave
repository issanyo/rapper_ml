[Intro]
You know death right around the corner and prison my next-door neighbor
Feel like I'm dyin’ to live
I know we live to die, but I feel like I'm dyin' to live

[Chorus]
I be clutchin’ on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby

[Verse 1]
I knew I shouldn’t have never showed you that I love you, my nigga
I fucked up when I showed you that I trust you, my nigga
I tried to turn my life around, but now I’m back in the field
You know it's free my nigga Cool, I hope he win the appeal
I lost my niggas, it ain’t been the same
Everybody say that I changed, say I ain't been the same
They don't even know I'm feelin’ pain
They don't know how I feel inside, traumatized, criminalized
But yet I'm idolized, I swear to God sometimes I wonder why
It got me brainwashed, lil' ones off the same block
Remember I had to slang rock, remember I let them thangs pop
Damn, I just wanna raise my son, wish it could've been how it was
Sometimes I wanna grab my gun
Sometimes I don't be wanna hear none

[Chorus]
I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby

[Verse 2]
My boy got shot, you put the blame on me
You say you know I did it
I can't even act like it ain't faze me
That shit hurt my feelings
My cousin got hit up, say he saw me jump out with the Glizzy
Why you had told them people you made me? Boy, you know you didn't
I hit that lick in Maryland, I bought my mama a Honda Civic
The hardest thing I had to do in life was leave you
I was showin' you love and had you feelin' like I need you
I'm drinkin' this alcohol right now, I wanna see you
You made me go hard in this shit, I'm motivated
Why you had gave up on the kid when I was jaded?
Now I've been drinkin', gettin' faded
Thinkin' 'bout how you played me
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me

[Chorus]
I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
