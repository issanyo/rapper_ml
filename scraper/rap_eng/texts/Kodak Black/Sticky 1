[Intro]
Totin', aye
That project baby two, hell yeah
But right now, this that institution
Yeah, for real man
For all that time I was down, man
They said I caught 11 years, man
Fuck that shit, look it, man
I do this shit bad, on the real, nigga
I never seen the work, dawg

[Verse]
Look, this for all that time when I was lost, they left me stranded
See, I don't even do this for myself, this for my family
I made a lot of mistakes, made it off circumstances
That could've ruined my life, I'm bout to sign with Atlantic
Look, God be lookin' out for me, he gave me several chances
I sent him a lot of prayers, he sent me a lot of places
My momma said "Imma make it" told me that it's destined
I put in a lot of work, and now my dreams manifestin'
Project baby, I cultivated, do somethin' amazin'
I pulled up, all that bullshit, I just couldn't take it
I thought it was over for a minute, a bad situation
I was so far away from home, but I just emancipated
I'm just so captivated, that I could be here again
So fascinatin', to see my people again
Swear I tried to leave the streets, but they was pullin' me in
My nigga rolled a statement on me, I thought he was my friend
I can't even pretend
I love to jump on these beats
Tell my fans what I'm feelin' deeply inside of me
This what's inside of me, y'all a big part of me
I'm sorry for leavin' y'all, this my apology
I just hope y'all believe it, got trues and paid dues
But it ain't easy as queasy, it's like I'm here for a reason
I just hit rock bottom, I thought everything was sweet
But many niggas so sour, man
My cousin had me sellin' powder, I was bumpin' em off
We used to bag em up, and keep it all at my momma house
All my niggas out there livin', just keep livin' it up
All my life, in the projects, I was livin' it rough
When I was down and out, ain't nobody really gave a fuck
They ain't really down with you, they only down when you up
I used to be that cafe fit, the full holster in the cut
A young nigga, sixteen, with Remy in my cup
I had to take a Gatorade, braid, ran to these streets
I had to cut my niggas, showin' they were playin' for keeps
That's all a nigga has to tell ya, they were leechin' on me
I ainâ€™t even charging them, getting fame for free
When I was in a sticky one, they ain't show no support
Before I learned how to swim, I jumped straight off the porch
We know a nigga from the south, hittin' licks up in north
I used to play ball, but now I'm in a whole other court
I'm married to the game, we ain't never tryna divorce
Fell in love with the game, I gave a bitch intercourse
Oh, you thought this shit was over with? Nigga you crazy
Kodak Black, I bounce back, like a foreigner baby
Boy this ain't no fugaze, run it back, yeah it's true
Ain't none of this no fugaze, what I be spittin' to you
Cuz I just get in the booth
And I be spittin' the truth
How I be spittin' to you, you think I'm missin' a tooth
How I be whippin' the coupe, you think I'm missin' no roof
Catch me playin' with the chick, like cock a doodle doo
I was out there on the jigga, call your boy jiggaboo
I ain't talkin' cereal, but I be gettin' the loop

[Outro]
Ha ha
Hell yeah, man
Kodak, keep movin'
You can do it
This that Institution
Free my nigga Kol
