[Intro]
I just bought a new Glock
I just bought a new glizzy
I just bought a new Glock
I just bought a new Glock

[Verse]
I just bought a new Glock, cost me three fifty
I used to lay these niggas down so I sleep with it
I be tryna chase my dreams but I be fighting demons
My Glock got a dick, I even pee with it
It's a XD, boy don't test me
Do your homework, boy I be with it
I get reckless nigga
I don't need my team wit' me
I ain't no selfish nigga so my whole team winning
And I ain't rescuing no hoe, I'm a keep pimpin'
I ain't Supermanin', I ain't savin' you
I just dropped a album, Project Baby Two
I got a son now, my little baby two
I got snakes on my gucci, I'm a Python
I got snakes in my closet but not in my yard
Snakes on my collarbone but not in my lawn though
Doing fraud, I heard that money good in Colorado
A new Glock this a nine, Rajon Rondo
Every show I do now look like the Apollo
Shawty said she love me
Project baby pull up on a nigga no Huggie
Put my BM in the BM used to drive a punch buggy
Kodak Bock I don't milly rock, I don't dougie
Yah, going up, top with Nene
Kodak Bop, I don't do the nay-nay
You won't never catch me tryna dab
I be posted on the slab, selling slab
I just bought a new Glock, generation four
Remember eating hot cheetos with sweet n low
Hot sauce with my Lays chips, eating rice with honey
Got me reminiscing 'bout my life when I ain't had no money
Just drunk a whole fifth, smoked a ounce of weed
I left stems in it, but I threw away the seeds
Almost threw away my life
I threw away the glove but I kept the ski on
Thugging with my res on
I'm on house arrest but I don't be home
I'm running through ya hoe, running in yo door
Got me running through this door like chain on eskimo
I'm grippin' on my tool, I will let it go
I can't keep my cool, I will let it snow
Free my nigga locked up, eating sloppy joes
Probably playing spades, probably playing dominoes
My gun ain't on safety, I won't play with you
So I advise you find you something safe to do
Cause I keep the fire on and I got a firearm
If you run up on me, nigga flaming you
Cause I got a home , gotta make it to em
On top of that, I got a son, my little baby two
I just bought a new wraith and it's baby blue
Project Baby 2, my lil baby two
I just got me a brand new glizzy
And I put a green bean in it
