I made the ladies dutty wine like I'm Sean Paulie
And I'm slidin' in an Audi, I coulda bought a 'Rari
But my mama told me save that money like I ain't got it
My girl just asked me for some money, I told her I ain't got it
And even though she know I got it, baby, I ain't got it
Yeah, Luc Belaire, I'm sippin', baby, I'm just livin'
Yeah, I just took Viagra, I'm waitin' for it to kick in
Yeah, you might think I'm crazy, think I'm so retarded
Yeah, but I'm whatcha-call-it, I popped a whatcha-call-it
