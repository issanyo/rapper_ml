[Intro]
I'm in the place...Kodak boy I ride with the k, 1k...I throw up the k, hold up the k

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away
I go to falling in too deep then I be running away
I was riding with the fire had to put it away
Them crackers back on my ass they wanna put me away
They gone look me up then hook me up and book me today
Had a kind lil heart the streets done took it away
Hypnotized watching all my niggas cooking the ye
I done sewed up the game I went to pushing the weight
Mama said the streets done took me away, took me away, took me away.....took me away, took me away

[Verse 1]
Ma you know it ain't nan
I'ma lil soulja I be mad that we struggling
Everybody happy and they glad that we wasn't
Now I'm in the jag I don't brag but I love it
When I ride past it look like i'm just stuntin
I just want the cash cause everything else coming
I just wanna kick it don't be thinking that we punting
I just wanna hit it one time and then I'm running
I be on a mission for them big face hunnids
Tryna stack them blueberries up like a muffin
Tryna hit ya kidney I be all up in ya stomach-
She wanna run away like Harriet Tubman
Niggas wanna hate I just wanna get money

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away
I go to falling in too deep then I be running away
I was riding with the fire had to put it away
Them crackers back on my ass they wanna put me away
They gone look me up then hook me up and book me today
Had a kind lil heart the streets done took it away
Hypnotized watching all my niggas cooking the ye
I done sewed up the game I went to pushing the weight
Mama said the streets done took me away, took me away, took me away.....took me away, took me away

[Verse 2]
Short nigga....I got long pistols
Want u to trust me but I got trust issues
Gotta get in my zone I gotta drug issue
Cool still ain't come home a nigga still miss you
Bet you put my shoes on but they can't fit u
Mama say what's wrong boy what done got in you
You been so far gone you let the streets get u
In my own lane niggas all in my rearview
I won't run away from you I'll run witchu
These niggas ain't 100 they won't thug witchu
I watch my niggas stack a block
I watch my cousin stash the pot
Had to stack a knot
I ain't have a ride I had to jack a car
Lil nigga so fly call me avatar
Lost a sack bounce back like a basketball
Before I got on my feet a youngin had to crawl

[Hook]
Everytime I get a good girl I just push her away
I go to falling in too deep then I be running away
I was riding with the fire had to put it away
Them crackers back on my ass they wanna put me away
They gone look me up then hook me up and book me today
Had a kind lil heart the streets done took it away
Hypnotized watching all my niggas cooking the ye
I done sewed up the game I went to pushing the weight
Mama said the streets done took me away, took me away, took me away.....took me away, took me away
