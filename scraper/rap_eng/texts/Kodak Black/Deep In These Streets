[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I ain't gone sugarcoat nothing
I'ma tell you times when I was up
I'ma tell you times I was struggling
When I was starving for that cash
Say I was money hungry
Was on my ass down bad
I needed food in my stomach
When I be rapping they love it
But I'm out here snapping like, "Fuck it"
Keep my head on a swivel
And keep my mind on that money
I ain't worried 'bout the fame
I fell in love with the game
She be giving me head
But I fell in love with her brain
I got love for my niggas
I know they love me the same
When I was going through my struggle
A couple of them changed
It's okay, I'm straight
'Cause I can hold up my weight
I was locked up in my cell
Had everything on wait
I'm on 1800 block, nigga, shouts out [Bake]
Once the road got bumpy, niggas went the other way
Everybody forsake me
Ain't no need for debating
I was showing love to niggas when I knew they was hating
Is it true or you faking?
I was gone on vacation
Now I'm back off vacation
And I'm like fuck, nigga, pay me
Gotta think before you speak
'Cause you don't know what you saying
Started off with a baby
Now I'm riding on Dayton's
I can't lose I'm just gaining
Once you sleeping I'm waking
You know I love .38s
But I still tote the .380
I'm a project baby
I'm tryna hit the suburbs
I'm tired of looking over my shoulder
Posted up on the curb
Posted up tryna serve
You wasn't there, you just heard
I be going with the flow
I just look back and observe
Got a trick up my sleeve
I got a lick for them D's
Got your bitch on her knees
She suck my dick with no teeth
I say Momma I can't swim, but I'm knee deep in these streets
I'm like fuck the industry because I'm deep in these streets
