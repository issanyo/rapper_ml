[Intro]
I'm God-sent, I know I’m God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God

[Verse 1]
I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages
Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument
Tryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me
They locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny
I don't drink no lean, I’m sippin’ on holy water like this my medicine
I'm a livin’ testimony, every album like a testament
Everything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me
So I'm breakin’ bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy
I done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me
They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent
My brother, my mother, and Alex fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me
I'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran
He speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend
Put my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it

[Chorus]
Ayy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

[Verse 2]
I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness

[Chorus]
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
