[Verse]
Watch when they find out me and you been gettin’ serious
Everybody ain't gonna like it when they hear
Girl, I don’t care ‘bout no fame, I make you famous
I don't care if that's the only reason you came for
These hoes always make me feel good, that money can’t
I can't find no love so I went to the bank
I was outchea looking for love so I went to the bank
We met at B.O.A and then we met again at chase
Every thug need a shoulder they can lean on
I like what's on your shoulders, good head you be thinkin' on
Speakin' of head, I hate sex but I love my peter blown
You're a lil freaky hoe but you complete me, though
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my bling on
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my Rees on
See I'm a dog, I be just trynna get me a bone
He roam the streets alone you need to leave em alone
Stray dog, I don't need a home I don't be at home, I'm fleeing home
Raw dawg when I fuck her with no rubber but my ski is on
She heard I'm snot side nigga over there
She heard I'm snot sneaky nigga over there
They tellin' me she a thot, that hoe over there
But I don't even care if she have gonorrhea
They say she a sick bitch, I heard she got syphilis
But I'm going head first, jumpin' straight in it
I'm just kiddin' but I love that little babe
But I don't care if she a slut, she still my bae
And I don't need you telling me about how she do
She fuck everybody, and I fuck everybody too
Everybody say she out here trickin', I don't give a damn 'bout how she get it
Everybody say she got all the niggas So what? I got all the bitches
We got chemistry, fuck your history, I don't care if she was out here strippin'
I'm tellin' you baby, they ain't gon' like you jumpin' out that Bentley
Hittin' the scene in the Bimmer, I'm T-Double-D, you Trina
Everybody tellin' me she ain't shit, but nigga, I ain't shit either
And I don't give a damn 'bout none of that shit my nigga say
He tryna convince me he seen you on backpage
Everybody got an opinion, I don't give a damn anyway
I took her on a private plane, I took her on a dinner date
Everybody fuckin', everybody sinnin'
So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain’t even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva
If you keep it up I'm put you on a TV-show
I was just trynna rap, you turned me to a singer
Found my focus back, turned me to believer
