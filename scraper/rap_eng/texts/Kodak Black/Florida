[Verse 1: Mr Flipper]
Been up all week down 'till my last seven bricks
No shade no shower I done bust about seventy licks
All day and all night in the same [?]
Some niggas hustlin' for the day to buy some new kicks
I'm grindin' a whole twelve months, year round
Servin' green, servin' white, servin' that Nino Brown
They fucked my city up when them flocks hit my town
My phone goin' ham, I'm takin' everything down
I put my own food on my dinner plate
My pockets on Rocky shit heavyweight
Tried to rob then them chopper bullets penetrate
Jumped in the Coupe, hit the gas then accelerate
Now I'm gettin' right back to the money
I fell in love when I saw them blue stripe hunneds
Watch me saran wrap them bricks, like a mummy
If the work got a dental, you got to serve the dummy

Aye you know I'm doing the money walk
On my Florida shit, spray gang on they ass
Aye, spray gang on they ass
On my Florida shit, you know my pants saggin'
Aye, you know my pants saggin'
On my Florida shit, you know I got big wicks
Aye, you know I got big wicks
On my Florida shit, you know I'm doing the money walk
Aye you know I'm doing the money walk
On my Florida shit, spray gang on they ass
Aye, spray gang on they ass

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Grass greener over here cause I'm Kodak Black
Paint pictures like a crayon on my cast
Want to spread on these bitches, colored money
Cause I got pink fifties and blue hunneds
I'm a [?] soldier, I'm a Nolia boy
Cutthroat, I'm a down south Florida boy
Lil' nigga slidin' big body in the No
I'm in Fort Myers, 23954
Love the Tri-county but ain't nothing like Broward do
But everybody clutchin' choppers off, fire for the loot
Fightin' in the projects, now we snipin' like we G.I. Joe
Wildin' with my zombies on earth, everybody Zoe
Lil' niggas hoppin' off the porch, ridin' big donks
Fuck school, want to hit the dentist, fill our whole mouth with gold
I got diamonds, I remember locked up eatin' sloppy joe
Lil' nigga, big ole pistol though
Lil' nigga I got big donks
