[Verse 1]
Couldn't even make it out my home, I was over thinkin'
Am I depressed or stressed, 'cause I don't even know the meanin'
Ain't got nothin' to say but why I'm jumpin' on the beat then?
Never personal, it's business, that's the way I keep it
Hollered at my clergy, he love me like his own semen
Just dropped a album but I still ain't got no time for sleepin'
I might wake up, drop a mixtape for no reason
Influence you lil' niggas, happy that you wanna be me
Know you fake, Instagram page told ya secret
No booty shakin' music when you pop my CD in
Play a crook by the book, I'm sittin' back readin'
Real recognize real, but looks can be deceivin'
I still fuck with Young Money, I'm just CMB'n
Miss my Audi, in a different Audi every season
Can't believed they flipped the Audi that I used to sleep in
Thug to the bone, you can't roll if you anemic
Brought hell on earth, my hoe know I'm cheatin'
I'm a zombie on earth, Z.O.E'n
I brought hell on earth, H.O.E'n
Zoe shit, ain't no hoe shit, I ain't H.O.E'n
I'm runnin' in the phone store, AT&T'n
I just found out my nigga a hoe, I can't believe it
'Cause I don't know the gender
Do I pimp her, do I G him?
You a transgender, I'm a wolf in sheep skin
So you was fakin' nigga?
You sit down when you peein'?
Caitlyn Jenner, shoot you in yo' legs cause you a lesbian
More stripes than Tyga, I want Kylie Jenner, tell her come with me then
It get greater later, wish my nigga was home to see this
I coulda been in Pluto but I got her sewed up in Venus
Future want me Freeband Gang, I can't 'cause I'm SG'n
Sleepin' and I'm geekin', sometimes I don't even feel like breathin'
How the hell I'm in a cell?
Was I ever home or was I dreamin'?
Woke up seen a demon
Walkin' like I'm Jesus
I pay lawyer fees, you just tweetin' "Free My Niggas"
I post commissary, I don't need to post a picture
Woe I'm in yo' corner 'til the world blow, I'm with ya
But I hope that I don't go broke again, nigga I'm killin' young babies
Kodak never goin' broke again, nigga you a free agent
Better have that same energy when you see me cause I'm goin' super saiyan
Reminiscin', wishin' my lil' brother wasn't incarcerated
Ya birthday Sunday, we just always end up locked up, ain't it?
With me on MTV on the red carpet, two lil' project babies
Yeah, at the VMA's we was the only ones taken
When this shit gon' end? I get out, you go in, it's crazy

[Outro]
Silence keep cloudin' me
Hands on my heart, it's soundin' like it's poundin' like the beat
Time never mattered
Time is money, I wish I could buy back all the time I gave away for free
Tunnel vision now, cause they was cloudin' me
I'm feelin' on my chest, I coulda sworn I felt my heart just beat
Yeah, time is money, diamonds on my Audemar
I can't keep makin' the system richer, they keep takin' time from me
