[Intro]
Damn girl, You so fine, I had missed you
I thought I was never gon' see you, dawg
Shit crazy

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
At times I thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya
But now i'm back out here and I won’t ever leave ya
I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don’t like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya
I remember poppin' checks, runnin’ up the meter
I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' thru a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl i'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix
I always see you in my dreams, I love to see you naked
Girl you know i'm from the streets, yeah i'm a project baby
Wonderin’ would you stay with me if I don’t ever make it

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm forever your lil hustler
You so bad i dont want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck i'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin’ nervous
I’m sorry for leaving you, ain’t do that shit on purpose

[Hook: Kodak Black]
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble
