[Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets
I ain't never been to Hollywood
I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood
I don't wanna go to Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I got kicked out of elementary
Started rapping, making melodies
Listening to beats on my MP3
Now my video on MTV
I got the BB gun in my bag
Brought the BB gun in my class
Call my momma and she sounded mad
Say when I get home, she gon' whoop my ass
I just dropped me off for 50 packs
I'm the youngest nigga in the trap
I'm the youngest nigga with that sack
Fuck your plug, I got that sack

[Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets
I ain't never been to Hollywood
I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood
I don't wanna go to Hollywood

[Verse 2]
I should have been a president
Young nigga with plenty sense
I can teach a little young nigga plenty shit
All these games, I ain't selling it
All this gas, I shoulda be selling it
Lately I've been really out of my element
These niggas be snitching, them crackas don't really be having no evidence
And I ain't even sick so why the hell am I sipping on medicine
Might get deported cause I be working like a Mexican
I just made a little power move and I ainâ€™t been broke ever since
Dropped out of school, run around finessin' shit
Running with some reckless ass lil niggas we be wrecking shit

[Hook]
Fuck the industry, I'm in the streets
I ain't never been to Hollywood
I'm not Hollywood, I'm Hollyhood
I don't wanna go to Hollywood
