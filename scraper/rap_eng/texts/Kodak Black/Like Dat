[Intro]
Sniper gang, Kodak
Cause I got it by myself
Skrrt, skrrt, aye, skrrt, skrrt (skrrt, skrrt)
Free lil Kodak man, free lil tap boy, yee

[Hook]
Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (aye, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
Cause I put molly in my lean (aye, Kodak, Kodak)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
Cause I got it by myself (aye, aye)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye)

[Verse 1]
I'm from the No, my lil bitch from the Dale
I like my money fast, you movin' like a snail
All I smoke is L's, on that paper trail
Can't you tell? I got clientele on my Nextel
I don't need your help, got it on my own
This a million dollar phone, but I ain't got no ring tone (aye, aye, aye)
Kodak, why you keep that thing on you? (aye, aye)
Cause I ain't got no time to play with you
All I do is win, I hate to lose
Got your boo dancin', cause that's what them bands make her do (make her dance)
I'm smokin' broccoli, counting green
I'm on molly, I'm on lean (I put molly in my lean, nigga)

[Hook]
Why you, why you keep that tool like dat?
Why you move like dat? I hit the club 50 deep (with my niggas, aye)
How you get so high like dat?
Why your eyes like dat?
Cause I put molly in my lean (in my lean, aye)
Kodak, why you act like dat?
Why you strapped like dat?
Cause I got it by myself (by myself)
Nigga, I don't need no vitamin C
I be smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for my health (aye, aye, Kodak)

[Verse 2]
Kodak, why you always in the foreign? (in the foreign car)
Cause if it ain't foreign, then it's borin' (that's a boring car)
I'm chasin' dreams, while you snorin'
Kodak Black, my bitch yellow, but her favorite color orange (color orange, boy)
Please don't call my phone no more, I'm on tour (bitch, I'm on tour)
Only two can fit, fuck a four door (fuck a four door)
Nigga, this a Jag, this is not a Ford (not a Ford)
Polo to the floor, fuck that Tom Ford (poppin' molly)
Nigga, this a Rollie, fuck that Michael Kors (fuck that shit)
I'm in here movin' slowly, cause I poured a four (I'm on that shit)
Got her on her knees, like "forgive me lord" (fuck that bitch)
I remember pullin' schemes, way in Baltimore (remember I was hittin' licks)
