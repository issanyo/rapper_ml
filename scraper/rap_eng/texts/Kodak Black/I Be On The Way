[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Aye I’m booted up out my mup
I’m on my way, I burned the clutch though
I got a lot to tell ya but right now I just wanna fuck though
I love you from the bottom of my heart but bae I’m cutthroat
That pussy good but tonight I wanna stick it in yo’ butt though
I say what I want when I wanna say it, I’m blunt baby
I mixed the KK with the cookie, stuffed it in my blunt
In the cell with a razor blade in my mat
I don’t shave but I hid the razor in my bunk
Pull up and I don’t honk
Hop out then I dump
My steering wheel on the right, it’s enough room in the trunk
I ain’t gon’ bump the horn or hit the horn when I pull up in yo’ front
Hit it on the porch or in the Porsche, kick it then I punt

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be your night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Beep, we in a pink Jeep Rubicon
Nothin’ cheap, free, rockin’ Gucci with the Louis Vuitton
Uh
And my son name King Khalid
Bag a nigga ass and do the dash, yeah, need for speed
Layin’ on yo’ ass, I’m in yo’ grass, you gon’ need to retreat
Sniper Gang, you think I’m playin’ all them games, you gon’ need retreat
I love you, we can’t get too deep
I skeet before I go to sleep
We can’t lay up in the sheets
Skeet, go back to the streets
Go back to the streets, you don’t belong to me
Yo’ heart in the streets, it don’t belong to me
Let yo’ soul bleed, pour it on the beat
Yo’ heart in the streets, ya soul belong to me

[Chorus: Khalid]
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day
Put it in drive, I’ll be outside
I be on the way
I be on the way
You can meet me in five
I’ll be all night
I’ll be all day
I’ll be all day
