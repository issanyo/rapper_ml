[Intro:Kodak Black]
Its like dog, I ain't got no self-control no more
I be trying to keep it gangster and shit but you, you be having me on that sweet shit
[Chorus:Kodak Black]
You got my heart got my mind
I think about you all the time
You shoot my blood pressure through the sky
If you leave my side, swear I'll die
Girl you got me, you ain't need nobody
I'm in love with you, jus your body
Now, I hope we never separate
I wonder do you feel the same
[Verse 1:Kodak Black]
Girl you got me, you don't gotta look no more
I'm all yours only if you want me too
But there ain't no
