[Hook x2]
Boy I'm from the block it ain't no fakin' it
I will have my Haitians eat your face and shit
Coming out my hood it ain't no making it
If I catch you slipping then I'm taking it

[Verse 1 Kodak Black]
Golden Acres shit, cuffed down to my anklet
Little boy don't play with me, I merk you and your neighbors
And i ain't on that label shit, so keep your papers bitch
Project Baby fuck that Sager and PlayStation shit
Me and my nigga running crazy home invasion shit
Paper chasing jit snapping snatching chains and shit
Stupid boy my mama Haitian don't you play like that
I'm a sniper I'm a sniper I'm a Baker Act
Coming out my hood, you ain't got no chance
Shoot you where you stand that's your right hand man
Ain't no fakin' it, i make you lose your sleep
You will see the streets vouch for me
Because I bleed the streets
I grew up in the streets so fuck the industry
Sticky weed and it came from Italy
I finesse the set you should never slack
Trying to run up on me, well don't you think like that

[Hook x2]
Boy I'm from the block it ain't no fakin' it
I will have my Haitians eat your face and shit
Coming out my hood it ain't no making it
If I catch you slipping then I'm taking it

[Verse 2 Kodak Black]
Ain't no making it, more cake than a bakery
Once you start that beef nigga ain't no shaking it
Hood rat, say cheese
Kodak take a pic
Don't you catch a strap attack cause man that dangerous
[?] I made this shit
I made a molly slushy bitch come take a sip
What set you claim? boy what game you playing?
You not from my hood, cause we don't talk the same
You don't play with pistols, you don't got no gang
Where your money came, shoot you like you lame
You can't get them bitches kick you out the frame
Project baby man i don't fuck around with no lame
I took your shit I'm gone plumb it up
Give that sack right to me watch me run it up
I'm a sniper nigga cause its my favorite sport
I can't go to school cause it's too many dorks

[Hook x2]
Boy I'm from the block it ain't no fakin' it
I will have my Haitians eat your face and shit
Coming out my hood it ain't no making it
If I catch you slipping then I'm taking it
