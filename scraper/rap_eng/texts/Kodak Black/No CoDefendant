[Intro]
Of course I wanna see you make it
Shit, only if you taking me with you
Shit, If you ain't taking me withcha now I don't know
Shit...

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't want to see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I don't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no codefendant
All 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't want to see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I don't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no codefendant

[Verse 1]
I'm on posted on the Ugly, I'm outcha in the open, wit it
I'm on that Zoe shit, ain't no hoe shit, ain't no folding in me
I got like four lil bitches on here, That one with no Jimmy
I ain't wear no suit and tie right now but I give the nigga the business
I should've killed my cousin that night 'cause he was my only witness
But I ain't kill him 'cause I love that nigga till infinity
And If I buy a house, you feel like you deserve to live in it
And If I buy a car, you feel like you deserve infinity
How the fuck you feel like that, when you weren't ouchta here with me getting it
You wasn't even at my sentencing
I was in a fucked up predicament
Oh you don't love me no more?
I ain't your brother no more?
'Cause I don't give you nothin' no more
I ain't your brother no more

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me making no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant
Oh 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant

[Verse 2]
You ain't have to eat grits, 3 in the morning
You ain't have to sleep with a nigga on the toilet
I was wearing Bob Barkers, you was wearing Jordans
All that bullshit, I'm trying to avoid it
I ain't ask you when you had your shot
I ain't ask you when we got kicked out
I ain't ask you, I was posted on the block
I was doing fraud, I was going up top
I was eatin' peanut butter
Nigga how you got my number
I don't really owe nobody
Matter fact I don't know nobody
Matter fact nigga leave me alone
I ain't tryna get out my zone
I ain't tryna get out my bubble
I ain't on that shit you on
I don't wanna relapse on niggas
I better not wack me a nigga
I'm just tryna rap these songs
So let me just rap these songs
You ain't take me when you had your time
You ain't take me when you had your shine
Why when I'm focused y'all saying I got changed
It's like y'all wanna see me in them chains

[Hook]
'Cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me making no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant
Oh 'cause I ain't looking out no more so you ain't fucking with me
You don't wanna see me make it no more since you ain't coming with me
And when I'm riding through the city I ain't need no soldiers with me
'Cause when I'm sliding on a nigga I don't need no CoDefendant
