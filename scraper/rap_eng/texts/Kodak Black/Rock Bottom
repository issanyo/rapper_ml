[Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father

[Verse 1]
Lil' kids look up to me like I'm they father (Like I'm they daddy)
Run up on me like "Kodak give me a dollar" (I give them five dollars)
Girl when I first met you, you was smaller (Girl you was so small)
Since I start hittin' it's like that booty gettin' larger
I just touchdown on yo' ass, feel like Tiki Barber
Now a nigga wearing Hugo boss remember when it starter (When it starter)
I just picked a pack up like Brett Favre (Like Brett Favre)
I just want to buy my mom a car (My mom a Bentley)
Stop right there girl we can't go no further (Baby stop it)
No not Listerine but shawty love to gargle (No not mouth wash)
Look cool nigga, but I'm hot like lava (Hot like lava)
Swimming in the money I need goggles (Swimming in the money)

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father

[Verse: 2]
I already know about you lil homie
I just checked your resume boy you a phony
Oh my god i hope that ain't the police
Cuz i got a 30 clip on me
Don't be calling me about your hoes
I don't want your girl, I got my own
Girl stop calling my phone, I'm getting money
I'm so geeked up, I'm paper junkie
McDonalds bitch, I love it
You broke as a joke lil boy you fronting
Looking for me I be on the ugly
In the projects right on 1800

[Chorus]
I just want the money
Cause I heard the money bring you power
Now a nigga on top
I remember I hit rock bottom
I don't wanna be yo friend
I already know you niggas sour
Hoe that ain't my DNA
I already know I ain't the father
