[Intro]
Kodak, institution
Shit crazy, a nigga came up slow though man you know
I tried every little hustle out here to get that bread

[Verse 1]
Came up slow, all off a caret of gold
I remember kicking doors, me and D's all hands stole
I remember we was poor, had to go get some dough
Cuban link on glo, polo, whip, my pants low
I'm too fly for you, I'm seeing through a birds eye view
I won't lie to you, she bald-headed like Caillou
All this time you was living in the skies
But now a nigga seeing right through
I'm the one gonna ride for you
I'm the one who came through
There was nobody else around
Let this shit change you, I'm the one gon hold you down
Look what we done been through, just think about everything
Thought you was my round, fuck the money fuck the fame
Ran out my wonder pain, I can't see a damn thing
My heart so cold I got ice running through my veins
Crazy how things change, you were just here yesterday
I just caught another case, I'm asking God for better days
Hit my knees and pray, forgive me for my selfish ways
I ain't mean no harm, I was tryin' get it straight
I was tired of second place, I was tryin' win the race
I just hope you understand, everyday's a paper chase
Everyday a damn struggle, you don't bother you in trouble
Thuggin' wit my brothers, on my life and the gutter
Crazy how things go, young nigga from Pompano
Can't go to jail no more, remember eating Sloppy Joe

[Bridge]
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real let me know
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real and let me know

[Verse 2]
I had ups and downs, times that with no one around
Told me stay humble, but I just didn't know how
I was just down bad, crazy I'm on now
Wanna see me locked up, its a blessing I'm home now
Deeper than zone pound, young nigga ten toes down
I be in my own lane, I go on my own route
Thras got me dumb hot, feeling like I'm on cloud
I was running wild, living fast had to slow down
I was in denial, feeling is in my foul
Fell victim to the system, free cool I really miss him
Taught me not to be a fool, young nigga keep the tool
Break your daughter heart, breaking all the rules
Learn my lesson in these streets, I ain't really go to school
Young nigga stick and move, fuck around and made the news
