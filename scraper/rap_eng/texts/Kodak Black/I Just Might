[Intro]
I Just Might Hit a Heist
I Just Might Catch a Flight
I Just Might Go Up Top Gotta Get it Right
I Just Might Go Lurking
I Just Might Murk Him
I Just Might Go Scoping
I Just Might Go Scoping

[Hook X2: Kodak Black]
I Just Might Go n Hit Me One More Lick
I Might Hit the Club and Cheat on My Bitch
I Might Cop a 50 Pack n Bump it Off Quick
Imma Flip the Pack into a Whole Damn Brick

[VERSE 1: Kodak Black]
Pulling up in a two door coupe with no tint
Imma bout to go and cop me a hummer whip
Told my math teacher you ain't gotta teach me shit
I don't need you Bitch I'm doing numbers with my wrist
My homie say he Damn bad wanna hit a Lick
He was wondering if I can take him on a trip
I know what he about he been flaw since a jitt
That my Dawg but I know we get caught he a snitch
I was car jacking had to get a lawyer quick
Promise I was guilty until proven innocent
Shawty say kodak black I wanna have your jitt
Then I say Shawty you ain't making any sense
Jaguar coming through Damm who is this
You don't have a single clue you don't have a hint
1800 block catch me right here on the strip
Imma call her ice cream hit her then I dip

[Hook X2: Kodak Black]
I Just Might Go n Hit Me One More Lick
I Might Hit the Club and Cheat on My Bitch
I Might Cop a 50 Pack n Bump it Off Quick
Imma Flip the Pack into a Whole Damn Brick

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
I'm thinking bout a lot of shit I'mÂ  brainstorming
Probably Finna go and see my dentist in the morning
She won't stop calling me your girl so annoying
She say that she only like me cuz I'm riding foreign
I just Might fall back stay up out the way
Yall ain't hear from me till I get my money straight
Going up the road I be on the money lane
I ain't tryna crash I am not a dummy mane
Everybody eating and they left me hungry mane
Took a nigga plate Cuz I had a tummy ache
No more p&j no more drinkin bubbly
Why yo Bitch popping up where my momma stay
Why yo birch calling off different number for
Early in the morning knocking on my momma door
I just might take the rental car to Baltimore
Coming back racked up Polo to the floor

[Hook X2: Kodak Black]
I Just Might Go n Hit Me One More Lick
I Might Hit the Club and Cheat on My Bitch
I Might Cop a 50 Pack n Bump it Off Quick
Imma Flip the Pack into a Whole Damn Brick
