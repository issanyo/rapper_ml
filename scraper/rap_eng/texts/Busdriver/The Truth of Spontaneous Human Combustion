[Introduction]
Spontaneous Human Combustion. This phenomenon is defined as the eruption of fire within the human tissues without any external ignition source. And many people believe it is possible

"Spontaneous human combustion evokes a firestorm of disbelief. It's perceived as a myth, a superstition born of medieval ignorance. Something that in the 20th and 21st centuries just shouldn't have been consideredâˆ’"
