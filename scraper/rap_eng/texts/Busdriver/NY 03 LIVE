[Verse]
Come on ya’ll
Come on ya’ll
Come on ya’ll
Come on make some noise
Here we go hit it Caural

Shit
Just like you I've been sleeping
Thirty men have come here looking creepy
I don't care if you don't believe me, man
Easy MC too sleazy to be seen
Oh!
I walked inside
With no shoes on
That I'm gonna be coming in with screws
And know I'm going to be beyond, and beyond, and beyond
Every time these guys are booked
Look! It's Driver!

Thank you very much, we're out of here
