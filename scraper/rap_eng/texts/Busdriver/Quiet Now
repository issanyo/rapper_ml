[Hook: Busdriver]
Her beauty is its own color
Her curves reveal its every promise
I'm without shrine when light bends to complement her outline
I am without shrine when light bends

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I'm just a man
Built to break and filled with hate
When I see beauty that cannot be put on a film and taped
When a woman appeared and light bended
She's an ethereal flight attendant
I thought that I was reborn or maybe life ended
I discontinued to suck on my ice blended
Thinking she was just made for adult modelling
To make men salivate
She developed a cult following
With vulgar mammals who want to clip her wings but I thought of her as a solar panel
And I'm not alone, most men agree
So I bedded my feelings in a foster home
Replaced them with Cro-Magnon testosterone
But I've never been good at hiding I've loved her since
Asked if she could color print the summer scent
And she did using notes flying out of golden tunnels with a single utterance
My man [?] brought to a bleak yelp
When faced with this woman wearing chlorophyll and sea kelp
And angels hung from behind her as her seatbelts

[Hook: Busdriver]
Her beauty is its own color
Her curves reveal its every promise
I'm without shrine when light bends to complement her outline
I am without shrine when light bends

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
There's a digital blip
On the whimsical length of whose physical fit frame
Depicts my indigo crypt
I'd like to die with my head on her bosom and sulk
Trade my thoughts with her like I was on wooden pulp
Sheets
All I could do was stand there
Sending her strands of hair
Put 'em in my vault to keep
She was like "we're not on the same wavelength"
And I was like "OH, you're one of those prima donnas"
"Reading melodrama from a teleprompter"
She's like come now I know you
Looking for rats who fornicate
At every point on the map on your tour date
Then to put 'em in your raps and record a tape
That may bear some partial truth
But I'm an artful sleuth and I care to say
You make Carmen look like a golf ball on a fairway
And I may be captivated by the scent of your hairspray
But I am not ...
I repeat ...
I am NOTâ€”HIM
Light bends around her
She won't register at the check-out counter
I stick my neck out
Offer her my web out
But I flounder

[Hook: Busdriver]
Her beauty is its own color
Her curves reveal its every promise
I'm without shrine when light bends to complement her outline
I am without shrine when light bends
