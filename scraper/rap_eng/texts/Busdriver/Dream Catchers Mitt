When I fall from the dream-catcher's mitt
I'm all thumbs
And not what she's after

My smoldering remains burn over glowing embers
As you ready and position short-term goal tenders
I lay un-kissed at the summer jams
A bag of ruptured glands
Who lacks reasoning to understand
My self-directed hate fits

We mouth the vilest sacrament
And adhere to these tacit skirmishes
All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched
We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes

This soft science leaves my body underwhelmed
Our ambitious union dissolves out of the color film
And I am just a crude outline
Obscured and pegged and numbered
Dangling off power lines
One of many discarded ex-lovers
Throwing pet food from the red carpet
At de-colorized coupling of heart-shapes
And all the panic-stricken flower maidens
Update their 'who to hate' list
My journal entries are irony-laden
And tirelessly self-loathing

We mouth the vilest sacrament
And adhere to these tacit skirmishes
All for one day ideal and saffron-drenched
We ate each other's hearts out of serving dishes

(Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt
Falling from the dream-catcher's mitt,...)

We've mouthed the vilest sacrament

I fell from the dream-catchers mitt

With smoking incantations and dead language motifs

Their defected army becomes my rogue fleet

Sequestering yahoo, superimposes his frail person
