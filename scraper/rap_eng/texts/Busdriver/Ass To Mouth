Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
When I drop shit, I'm all that you ask about [x2]

I made a big splash on the gossip column
When I hit the rock bottom
In the streets spending electric bills
I'm dumb enough to try and re-invent the wheel

Haters volunteer
To smear names on the blogosphere
Until they get what they want to hear

Oh yeah!

My outbursts set the bar high
Wildfires set with art supplies
I'm rotisseried in the MRI
They keep taking shots like bar flies

And I return fire
I return fire
I return fire
With rounds out the lips of a church choir
All the freaks in the seats need to keep engaged
So the intelligentsia acts barely drinking age

(It's like)
Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
When I drop shit, I'm all that you ask about [x2]

If you think I've eaten my fill, well you've heard wrong
My stomach's only filled with bird song
My body's waste is like precious metals
So I walk around thinking I'm extra special -

But I'm the Antichrist
I'm the Antichrist
I'm the Antichrist
So what I say, it can't be nice

They eat shit sandwiches at the discotheque
And talk about me to keep their whistles wet

Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
Ass to mouth, ass to mouth, ass to mouth
When I drop shit, I'm all that you ask about [x2]
