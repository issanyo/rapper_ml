[Intro: Nocando]
Cha, cha, cha

Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Yeah, yeah

Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's
Kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Ah, here we go

Cha, cha

[Verse 1: NoCanDo]
Tilt ya head back
Make ya shoulders shake
Let ya arms swang
Baby hold up weight
Bend ya back a little
Now a little mo'
Not that much
Alright, there ya go
I did the bernie
A bernie with a dirty birdy
She put the, she put the thang on the thang thang
She did the bernie with a flirty curtsy
And worked it like a slave on a chain gang
We cut a rug
And laid a layer of carpet
I showed Regan, Regan said "You retarded."
I'm expressin' myself
I'm a artist
Embody bernie, nig, nigga I'm a carcass
Nigga I'm the coolest
Nigga I'm the smartest
Turn the beat on I do my bernie regardless

[Hook]
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse, corpse
Cool as a, cool, cool, cool as a corpse, corpse, corpse

Its kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse
Cool as a corpse
Cool, cool as a corpse, corpse
Cool as a, cool, cool, cool as a corpse, corpse, corpse
Its kinda like Weekend at Bernie's

Dance like a old dead white man
Dance like a old dead white man
Do the old dead white dance
Dance like a old dead white man
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
Hawaiian shirt, fishermen hat
...Khaki cargo pants

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I used to think I was super cool
Dance until I smelled like a puma stool
Jazz hands with glitter gloves and jitterbug
Up with this rap band
Started dancing like they needed cat scans
He said shake your head and let your arms go numb
And make your body heavy like a cargo ship
Now I'm really cookin with the charcoal lit
I used to sweat 1993, and dress like Diamond D
But doin' the bernie cured my "hey-bruh"-titis B
Now everyday I do the bernie
And power lunch with Jewish attorneys
Bought a Coffee Bean, paired up to form a Ponzi scheme
Like I do the Bernie Madoff
For real, only eat pâté, and play golf

[Hook]

[Outro: Busdriver]
Flash bang grenada
Teachin' old people how to dance
Get em my nig
