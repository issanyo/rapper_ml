[Intro]
Driver!
(Look Out!)
Yeah
Oh Shoot!

[Hook]
I'm so hungry, man, I could eat the rich
Eat, eat, eat the rich

Check me out

[Verse 1]
Things are looking good, but I can't mess with your hair though
Ergo, the ladder climb is an air show
But thank God you like I'm fucking with that hood shit
And treat me like you think I wrote up the instruction booklets
The instruction booklets, the instruction booklets
Cause of my home, the hammers pop
But your selfies look like glamour shots
Before that endorphin high, I take orders like George Takei
And scorch the sky, poor guy, I'm a horse fly and that's because

[Hook]

Let's eat, Kenny
Celebrate a little bit
Let us not eat them
Celebrate if you eat, nigga

[Verse 2]
On high booty cheeks, y'all are thieves
Swallow new acts, how to rap
Don't let them style with child proof caps
You there? I'm a rough approximation of Type A
And Type B at a dice game in a white tee with a nice chain
And snarky web presence you can't turn up in a text message
Without at least a million video views
Watch the millennials brood
Make sense of it all, there's diamonds in the loaves of bread
I'm looking for 'em in the hood like a floating head
Like a floating head, like a-- like a floating head
My dinner prayers meant for an asteroid wake
I'm reading that shit from a fat boy's tape
I'm still eating, nigga, but it's all soy-based

[Hook]

Let's eat, Kenny
That's right
Perfect Hair

[Outro] x3
Kenny Segal's drums sound like he's dropping desks
Your whole lot's a hot mess, I confess, we got that Aquafresh

That's tight
