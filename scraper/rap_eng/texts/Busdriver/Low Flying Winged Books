Dancing numbers
Between the antennas of paint-speckled insects
Plagued by special interests of CEOs
Eat-and-go
Exaggerated ego
You remain unloved due to my polarized biochemistry
I pounce upon a law-abiding commoner
And flaunt a denounced wrong
I prey on the evening
And debase the office building
Sharpened shears
Flashed before your startled peers
An encapsulated tempest
A waterproof seed
Poured into a nigga's outfit
I map personas off camera
While riding low flying winged books

Low flying winged books
Through translucent skin

Breathe soot
Under a precooked smiley-faced sun
From out of the c-section suture
A flock of birds float skyward
As if the laws of physics had no bearing
Nature's tendrils coil
Around the android limbs
I honor the existential loyal minion
I confront the simple truth
And dissect every nuance
I climb up a blue flight of stairs
I compare a terrestrial living
To a sky city
I fly on these books
