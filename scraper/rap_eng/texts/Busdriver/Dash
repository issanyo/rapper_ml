[Hook: Kail (William Redd Thedford IV)]
Dash of this, dash of that
In a dash, she dash it back
You ain't whippin' like dash would
Limo tints on the Dashwood
Now your bitch blowin' Dashwood
Francis muthafuckin' Dashwood
Thuggy

[Verse 1: Kail (William Redd Thedford IV)]
He be trim taper hemmed in the tailored fits
His neighbor's fenced, plus his tool time's to Tim Taylor's tint
His invader's clipped, clip, clip, take a trip
Dip whip, Haitian bitch to cater thick
Queen of dictatorship, dictate your lips
You dicked Taylor Swift quick
Make the trip, taste the brick
Played the bridge, case the sniff
Facial tits, facial twitch
Like this shit was hit with a writ by a bake maker kit
Now run it back, run it back, oh
Then switch back to gangsterish
Nah, you switch sweet souls with the sugar sweet hint chocolate flavoured mints
Uh, you tramp, bitch!

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
Up in the clouds in a future resin, feelin' like I'm in a child's music lesson
As a first trial on human specimen that guarantees
Bio-luminescence
The gorgeous room tore it's (?) in a board room
Morris (?) orange moons screamed and heard that I'm with whom
When I turned on Hazmat animal
(?) than your flannel bro
Friends become trans-vaginal
When I run my hands fast, a camel toe
I'm in a jean jacket making pre packaged steamed cabbage, making it seem ratchet
I'm an extreme habit that would wreak havoc on screen actors until they seize acids
Nigga!

[Interlude:VerBS]
About to dash to the spot. I'm about to go do like a
Rockstar energy and some like peanuts for a dollar and a hot dog and maybe like 2 slices of pepperoni pizza from 7-11, I'm dashin'

[Hook: Kail (William Redd Thedford IV)]
Dash of this, dash of that
In a dash, she dash it back!

[Verse 3: Open Mike Eagle]
You got an eagle head and chicken hands
Kinda racial like spic and span
You can tell how much I give I damn when I bust out my Ed Grimley dance
And my hips twist, my knees knockin', I'm fit to be lockin'
I'm full of more shit than those History's Mystery's Top 10s
And I won't wait for your pro case
I wrote whole papers in bold face
I rotate this whole place at my own pace
Fuck the taste of that Colgate, it's disgusting
It's not even up for discussion
Thrustin', heatin' up a combustion
Chicken handed, Eagle up in your function, bumpkin

[Hook: Kail (William Redd Thedford IV) & Open Mike Eagle]
Dash of this, dash of that
In a dash, she dash it back
(Eagle up in your function, bumpkin
Eagle up in your function, bumpkin)
You ain't whippin' like dash would
Limo tints on the dashwood
Now your bitch blowin' Dashwood
Francis muthafuckin' Dashwood
Dash of this, dash of--!
