[Intro]
[Radioinactive]
Partly cloudy with an increased chance of rain (X 4)
With an increased chance of rain

[Busdriver & Radioinactive]
Today’s weather is
A glazed beverage
With a grave emphasis
On the strange letter bridge
And the dames we assist
When we exchange  leadership
Put the change in the meter bitch
Y’all can eat some zebra shit
With a fork and knife and tartar sauce
It’s the corporate plight of Haagen-Dazs
To pour Coors Light on the cotton cloths

[Busdriver]
For people who bring flat screens to book burnings
And put earnings in the soiled pampers of oil canvas painters

[Radioinactive]
Painting pictures of people
With mixtures of evil watered down with a gospel crown
I don't think we're in Kansas anymore

[Busdriver]
I don’t think we’re in Timbuktu
Get a lip-tuck tit-reduction big-butt-lip-o-suction at the annual bible luncheon

[Radioinactive]
I pull stunts in
With an eyeball crunched grin
Why not wear a waterproof necktie to the function?
Do what you gotta do
Go to Lake Havasu to cook some rabbit stew and have an old lady gab at you

[Busdriver & Radioinactive]
The Weather will talk your head off
The parking attendant
Will park your attention span
Against the demented plan
Of a white ninja in Japan
With Red Cross
Medical coverage
Our legible smudges
Are well received
Like health-conscious women dressing their husbands
Drinking vegetable slushes
I disassemble my musket
Over an instrumental of Milli Vanilli
The caterpillars are willing to kill me
The castle builders are building a villa
For women and children
Are living in limited numbers
With primitive plumbers
An innocent mother
Is giving a pilgrim
Some supper

[Radioinactive]
Let the money sit, cooler
Show the satellite picture
Newspaper and sin also
That's the human need; the weather

Partly cloudy with an increased chance of rain (X 4)
With an increased chance of rain

[Busdriver & Radioinactive]
Today’s forecast
Is that you’ll be suffering a pain in your lower back
You can not get on this plane without a boarding pass
You should drink a quart of gas
It’s interesting how nuclear warheads laugh
As Hercules’ forehead is smashed
On a wall of weather
That’s why we wear
These koala sweaters
Like they were tailored
Let’s save a whaler
From major failure
In a Vegas trailer
Page your dealer
Pay the waiter
For a plate of taters
Irritate your neighbors
By real estating acres
Near a lake where ravers
Get earaches from lasers
Bearded naked bathers
Get near the sacred savior
To hear the tape deck player
Cold front
We’re too old to smoke blunts
So we promote funk
That make
Adults hump
We catapult jump

[Radioinactive]
Partly cloudy with an increased chance of rain (X 4)
With an increased chance of rain
The weather
