[Intro]
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
(Barbs over) breakfast scones
Ayo, what the fuck is this?
(?) Let's go
Hellfyre Club
Hellfyre Club

[Verse 1]
Lie, decrease my ventricle
Eat the peach of my special ho
Bleaching sheets with an X and O
While we breathe deep while flexible
Your cheat-sheet's unethical, homie
Decrease your decibel
My team's deep in dressing robes
Going "Hee hee" at your present goals
You eat your crescent rolls
With cheese wiz in your flesh folds
Seek deep in your section codes
Because you didn't do well in the exit polls
Not me, nigga, boy's straight
I can land hoes like "Ahoy Mate!"
But I feel that after the noise game
Free Spink rethink Tolstoy's take
Hot topic at the water cooler
Rich niggas, they're on to the movers
Like entrepreneurs
Store fronts gettin' foreclosed and poured O's in Morse code
Turned the whole Southland to an Art exhibit
Making murals from a thousand outstanding parking tickets

[Bridge]
Through the 90's I stepped in poo-poo
I think the Headsman stepped in Fubu
Girls wanna let me inspect their juice boobs
My niggas call me Desmond Tu-Tu

[Verse 2]
Reborn in an online forum
Pull me out of the egg yolk
I am a synthetic life form
So I'm gonna go rob a stage coach
Or the dude with the hip
With my stick
Go naked under a rain coat
Gold in the cusp, it's social injustice
As my advocate scapegoat
I really wanna go hard in the paint
Better go dishearten
And the painting red hardens
Since I was eighteen
Eating peanut butter sandwiches
And the baked beans
On my lunch break
(?) speed
My fuck face
Potential buyers gettin' cup-caked
Open mouths gettin' ducktaped
Oh

[Hook]
I praise the style
Like a gemstone
Cause it feels like
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones
Barbs over
Shit
That style you got
Is from a rest home
Large shit
Barbs over breakfast scones
Breakfast scones

[Verse 3]
No corporate endorsements, just door splits re-enabling lives
Dwarfs with horse whips makin' you force quit Abelton Live
I tickle the name on the skies
And I'm able to wonderprize
Minimize Bible covers like it was casual Friday on a nude beach
Don't keep it ridic army
I throw ditch parties through the school week
And at the pitch meeting, I get artsy tout de suite
Hellfyre Club (?) galavanting through the high speed zone
So any motherfuckers that I dethrone, gets a ice cream cone
And his idea thrown

[Verse 4]
Visit my high rise and leave light-headed
My go-go juice is a diuretic
Take the sound, my face a life sentence
You lookin' to get a high attendance
You got a bigger following, you're so grown
Better make it appear in the Euro zone
My ideas are the biggest threat to national security that the federal bureau's known
I am the shit, man
You are just shit
Turn up the low end up on the sub mix
Ya'll niggas don't know what it encompass
Ya'll niggas hate girls, so you punch tits
We handed out those dietary supplements
Any time you hit us with a double-click
Other rappers complain that their muscled pinched
Feedin' off the label's supple tit
But I pull all the party pranks
Talk funny like Barney frank
When I'm off that Bacardi drank

[Verse 5]
Handed my people a limited-edition rigor
(?) Guatemala (?) in the middle era
Actin' like a pistoleer, but I know
(?) that's crystal clear
Everything is literal, stop all the horseplay
Married to the rap game, you're a divorcée
Liquefied audience turnin' into sorbet in Norway, it's a forté
But, as I get older, my complexion
It's like that of pork belly skin
And over time, public policy becomes more Orwellian
Hold up, let's start over
My stream plays ain't prepaid
So whenever your mouth's like sleep aids
I'm bargin' through police raids
Sweltering in this Los Angeles heat wave
And I'm comin' to your house, homie, I just got keys made
Yeah

[Outro]
P.P. for my pressure zone, so the
C.P. is your second home
So you made feces from a (?)
Soundin' like Chief Keef on the metronome
So the beasties like breakfast scones
Do this on your own time
P.P. for my pressure zone, so the
C.P. is your second home
So you made feces from a (?)
Soundin' like Chief Keef on the metronome
So the beasties like breakfast scones
(Oh snap, Driver
You're interrupting cellphone service
You delineating the timeline
You, fuckin'...
You promptin' premature births, man
Hellfyre)
