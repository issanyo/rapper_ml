[Intro: Busdriver]
Fuck L.A. This place sucks. I know, 'cause I live here
Suck a dick... It's good for you
(Aesop Rock, Busdriver)
(Let's get it)

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Yeah, I ain't really felt good since '81
The potassium move my atrium
Let me suck on this fucking round like a metallic baby thumb
My vest has always been double breasted
My hustle etiquette Enterobacteria
So I am at work in this concession stand in Terabithia
It not impeding the Malaria
That's a map of Libya
But if all these motherfuckers don't know the difference
Recall every nigga I'm a city brah
But if you look on my Netflix queue
I got difference too
Celebrate all of my settlers through
No breaths for two
I'm a smokestack living off building clouds
Like chemical defoliants
Holy shit I'm a nice box for livestocks where my thoughts
I should be on suicide watch
But i'm left to express this moratorium
Of a poorly run toy run
I used to make rappers walk the plank
Make it rain like a paper route
All the niggas say as I drank
So what if it was nigga juice
Y'all bit my body of work
Sort of like a saber tooth
And the labors all for the races
Establishment like David Duke
All the bars are nightly, nigga
Straight Baby Ruth
Plus you got me feeling hoarse
Walking around in daisy dukes
Y'all some Scandinavian pimps
I'm like Arabian prince
Holding a baby anywhere under your gator boots
Me, I just want to be loved
I forgot how to
Give me some rigid deprogramming for me to smile to
Well my whole soul is mildew
In cultural milieu
Aroma oils will build through
The rolls will kill you

Refrain
Cause I don't like you nigga
Yeah I don't like me nigga
And I don't like them nigga
Fuck us all
Check us out

[Verse 2: Aesop Rock]
Ey
Ey, ey, ey, ey
Uh, uh
(Get em Aes)
Ey
A barkin archived influential images
And hope your afternoon
Is tommy g and future primitive
Hoarded zelda maps and
And voted build a cap of president
With bells attached
Turn a silverback into a jellyfish
Any fish a lamb brand
Braceface gangrene
Sweating at the helm
Of a Benny Hill chase scene
Always
Wake up with a fever like a wicker man
Raking up his brow
Never bow unto a Pinkerton
Drinking a short arm
A small biz all piss
Licking dog blood
Of a clawed
The office
Ah dip
Rap is the app of the little bitches
They get up on the stage
And start ordering thin mints
The snail pace kids
Spin yarns with the bin minced
Guards armed with the cowlick of pin pin
Out with the in
While inventing all nighters
The kind that start sensibly
And end with bald tires
Reprehensibly
Here's a little one act i call
Rubber glue
Once upon a fuck you
Fuck you to
I drop bass onto megadeath
Scale, exhale
In the company of delicately shredded entrails
One cannot scrap the vibe easily
The moment you deny us of a pie divided equally
But
My whole soul's old news and cultural go tos
And son of a gold tooth
The summary folds you

[Refrain]
Cause I don't like you money
Yeah I don't like me money
And I don't like them money
Fuck us all
Check us out

[Outro]
What up
Ooh yeah
