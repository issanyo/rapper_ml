[Intro]
Uh, yo, it's like
I been there
Already know it
I been there, yeah
Uh, yo
I been there, yeah
Already know it
I been there, yeah
Already know it, yeah
Yes

[Verse 1]
I was always extra crisp[??] with the French kiss
The mass exodus to the next abyss
I pushed that sex bliss to the precipice
And now we share that bunk bed
But that goes unsaid
[?] machine read that raised me well
Most likely to go straight to hell
Straight from K to 12
Then unschool new new[?] got that new baby smell
But you don't like how I respond to that safety bell
You greet us, I'm leaping out the brush
You said to keep it quiet but I can't keep it a hush
I'm blushed, read it out aloud the royal flush
My vanity plate now reads "deez nuts"
But don't count the ring on my team's tree trunk
We pulled them all-nighters so you know me from my coffee breath
We can time travel with our body weight
You know I got the one fifty volts when you asked me for the [?] results

[Chorus]
I been there before
I been there before
I been there before
And trust me you don't wanna be where my heart done been
Oh no, no, please don't go there
I been there before
I been there before
I been there before
I been there before
I been there before
And trust me you don't wanna be where my heart done been

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm the center of a dead moon
With a [?] on the wet spoon[?]
We run through traffic and rush [?]
Philosophical debates with Archibald
Asking if the art is raw
[?] if there's no original styles
In your cynical trials
Then clearly, man, it's hard to call
And I ignore you just like [?] would
You're only here because the morning wood is like sporting goods
I cram the love yous into the sound cannon
Now my progress reports are all outstandin'
But you don't love me girl, 'cause I observe planets
Like one turns granite and learns Spanish

[Chorus]
I been there before
I been there before
I been there before
And trust me you don't wanna be where my heart done been

[Outro]
Yo, yo
Yo, yo
I've been there before
I've been there before
