[Zeroh, Jonwayne & Busdriver]
It burns, it burns, it burns
It's warmer than my cold that's when
The time, the time, the time
And say, say, say, say, okay
So far gone
To the light, to the light, to the light, to the light
When the world starts to cauterize
It burns, it burns, it burns, it burns
Unique, you know, you know (know)
Fly (five)
In the air (In the air)
Sleep deprived (5 to 6 to 7)
Weep nights
Seize impossible (6 to 7 am)
Unnecessary and philosophical (So sin to the father)
It's hereditary
It lets us vary verbs around the word scary
Words carry
They made him sit in the back of the room
And all his friends they went back to the moon (It burns, it burns)
All his friends they went back to the moon
Unnecessary and philosophical
They went back to the moon (So sin to the father)
He's hereditary
Would lets us vary, verbs and words, the worlds scary (They carry)
Got my friend
They went back to the moon
It'd break all relevance and letter, respectively, no corrections
God makes use of the instruments
I see the aura's (I know your color)
I see the aura's (I know your color)
I'm the forest (and we the mother)
They snoring on us (undercover)
You know the Voyage
And some other shit
Talking the foliage (foliage, foliage)
Talking the foliage, foliage, foliage
Talking the foliage, foliage, foliage
