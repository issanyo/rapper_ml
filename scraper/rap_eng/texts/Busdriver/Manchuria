[Verse 1: Busdriver]
My coffee-stained black husband should have been pulled in the nineteen-hundreds[?]
[?] my skin looks like a [?]
[?] Tenderonis
Give girls the reddish buttocks
After that see them club members only[?]
The photosynthetics I walk covers up my mummified cult
[?] blares through me through hundreds of high volts
Due to me being old as fuck
When all the [?] going on and on about fighting power
Assumed you were talking about Eisenhower
[?] really looks like we desensitized the shish kebab
But they holler with my dogs like I'm in the Iditarod

[Verse 2: Myka 9]
Manchuria near Siberia
Nineteen-hundreds, Asian-esque
Northeast of the Chinese wall
Railroad empire dusk to dawn
Mongolia morning to night
Earlier to late, breakfast to dinner
Consider great Genghis Khan
Waking moment, dozing off
Dream state, design [?] spicy meals
Spirited work ethic culture
Colorful, vast dynasties closing eyes
Opening wide, stretch and yawn
Hope inside, taking second minute
Hour to light, to dark, to sun, to sky
Moon, solar, major rickshaw candidate
Cuisine, [?] chopsticks, monks
Temples, waste fields
Buddha isn't everything

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
They caught me [?] elite [?]
Appalled with a [?]
A free market in that neat[?]
But what I mentioned
Like it made Garth Trinidad barf in a bag marketing ads
Or slipping in and out of my arthritic hands
My inner eye is a carbonate vag
My Ivy Leaguers and Tai Chi teachers probably think I read Faulkner
Because my understudy I'm a hundred and twenty
For bringing it onstage I need a walker
My deliberate confronts are not [?]
With my AARP car limit
[?] put my middle finger up to commander in chief archbishop
I boast a post-apocalyptic preface in my motherfucking Keynote speech
The conservatives murder kids and put them in a sheet for the [?]
[?] liberate caramelized fiction nugget [?]
Then throw all the new [?] marine lobbyists

[Chorus: Busdriver, Myka 9, Both]

Sending waves[?]
