[Verse 1]
You're living in a fantasy world, putting gas in a pumpkin
I never suit up or fasten a button
Even when offered to dance or nothing
I'm back in the dungeon lacking the funding to
Paint the town red on bail
My monobrow's just like a monorail
Girl, you're a category 5, a very awesome mind
This is why we got married in Autumn
But I'm hiding behind the cherry blossom
You might as well just bury me in a coffin
You bury me in the cloud cover
With a ledger full of loud colors 'cause I've been outnumbered
They said, "It's your turn to take 'em away."
My masterpiece of paper mache
A loaded gun, the end of the day
You're killing me off in my favorite way
Snapshots of my misery with slow shutter speed
Most niggas, they brush their steed, puff their weed, but not me
Sequestered in Birmingham while you're at Burning Man
Listening to Birdy Nam Nam, acting like a girly man
I'm more like early man
Mixing colors for a cave painting
But my safe haven's like a space station
I never wanted a women who busted balls
Or a lot of homies for trust falls
Executive orders for tough calls are all mine
What you suggest was pretty dumb
My mind's full of undigested idioms
That's why my heart's a congested city slum, nigga

[Interlude]
There are constellations at my ceiling
There are constellations at my ceiling

[Chorus]
You can be what you want to be, you and
You can be what you want to be, you and
You can be what you want to be, you and
You can be what you want to be, you and

[Verse 2]
You crazy Driver!
Like Iâ€™m tingling off of the bath salt
Overstimulated black adult
They putting my eyes in a catapult
But why would I need to see the stars?
My mind's a sea full of stars (All of them)
Invasive procedures get okayed
It cuts a lot deeper than a close shave
'Cause social lubricants are roach spray
And my center of gravity's a poached egg
I'm blank, I can't sigh in relief
My ego can hang glide on a leaf
I don't recall having my hand held
So I'm looking through all of my fan mail
For a lady who can dance well
Who's guaranteed to make my glands swell
Or I'll hang up my point shoes when these twinkle toes tire
And fix my point of view with needle-nose pliers
Let the sheeple soak in fire as walking sleeping disorders
I sleep in cocoons, eat balloons and piss mortar

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want

[Chorus]
To be you and you can be what you want
To be you and you can be what you want
