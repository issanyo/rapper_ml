[Chorus]
I can't believe I lost you
How much did this love cost you
[?]
I can't believe I lost you

[Verse]
You know I'll land on my feet
You know I can't be beat
I can't believe I lost you
I can't believe I lost you
[?] still you beg for more
I put my fingers on your palms
Make your insides crawl
[?]
Walking to [?] you nightmare [?]
On your deathbed dreaming wildly
[?] your delight[?]

[Bridge]
Is it real
Is it real
[?]

[Chorus]
I can't believe I lost you
How much did this love cost you
[?]
I can't believe I lost you

[Outro]
How can you be sure
She won't return
How can you be sure
She won't return
