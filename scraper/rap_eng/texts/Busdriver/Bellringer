[Verse 1: Kassa Overall]
Kass One game over the bellringer
I told you to tell Springer
I'm different like a soldier with twelve fingers
Words from heaven even though hell lingers around
Speakin' of words, sound power trippin'
Think I might never land
I think I'm becoming a better man
Most saints were once sinners
So have faith, you're a winner
Tap to the inner
Chop it up with Splinter
Cowabunga! pizza for dinner
Pizza pizza, love to greet ya
Need to meet ya
Kass One be a rhymin' ass creature
Violent ass features

Sleep on the track, Vic in the bed
Somebody's dog licking my head
Upper cut, bubble gut
Big Bird, knuckle up
Snuffleup, fuck with us, yeah!

Passin' and runnin, gassin' and gunnin'
Smashin', ashin' and diamonds, laughin' and smilin'
