[Verse 1: Milo]
Boredom is represented by the Sunday
One day I will redecorate my living space with Feng Shui
Re-calibrate my auras
Align my chakras with doorknockers from Pier 1 Imports
I have been a good sport, patiently waiting on my turn
While learned astronomers paint constellations upon urns
I grow where the red fern simply cannot
And Hellfyre Club exists to thicken the plot like

[Hook: Busdriver]
Leak out the coiled kink
It's knighted at the roller rink
Ya'll know we overthink
And so we keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on

[Verse 2: Milo]
At the height of my despair
All I could think about was
Weebles wobble but do not fall down the stairs
They do not scream out their prayers
Why did the supreme deity permit BET to represent all our affairs
I think that was an error
But I am scared sir to raise my voice above a reasonable tenor
Now I pluck my suspenders, and contemplate the zen words
Like I am Alan Watts or a palindrome for Medabots

[Hook: Busdriver]
Leak out the coiled kink
It's knighted at the roller rink
Ya'll know we overthink
And so we keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Black math tutor known to keep the circuit wet
Go pop a percoset
Keep them argyle socks on
Argyle socks on
Argyle socks on

[Verse 3: Milo]
Keep a large stash of nice pens
Learn not to be rash with monthly stipends
Forget the names of every tight end on all the teams
Do not let yourself become addicted to Benzedrine
Tempered dreams with muffler steam among other things
Give your mother angel wings
Pluck piano strings but call it a harpsichord
Build a log cabin from particle boards
If you're not already bored

[Hook: Busdriver]
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we, ya'll know we
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we overthink
Ya'll know we, ya'll know we
Ya'll know we overthink
