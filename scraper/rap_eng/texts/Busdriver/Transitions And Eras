[Hook]
Transitions and eras
Ambitions of circa
Pictures from our heritage
And images of how we lived
Rhythm of the jazz poetry and soul that we give
(x2)

[Verse 1: Aceyalone]
I'd like to introduce you to the new
Haiku D'Etat is raw
I hope that all of y'all can come aboard
And join the sons of cool
We're going to the moon
I'd like to get you more acquainted with the
Thing that we do best
To give the gift of music to the world
And never blow our cool
We're going to the moon

[Bridge: Aceyalone]
Completely reborn
The newest crew in all mill-enium baby
I'm completely reformed
I'd like to introduce you to the new
Haiku D'Etat is raw
I hope that all of y'all can come aboard
And join the sons of cool
We're going to the moon
Blue moon

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Abstract Rude]
Nighttime let's go see what's jumpin'
Ladies dressing all vintage
Like it's back in the day
In they hat & they gloves
And when they walk hips sway
Dancing like Shug Avery
Causing they shimmys to shake
We got our suits on as sharp as can be
Tip the valet throw him the key
Go ahead and park it for me
What's this another masquerade?
I'm in their e-mail database
So they invited me
On this Poseidon adventure in a cabaret
And I had to take them up on their offer
A juke joint like this
It doesn't happen that often
Won't be open that long
Before they call in the coppers
So let's jam all night
Until they break in and stop us
Piano playing my favourite tune again
Now what it takes is upright bass properly placed
Rim shot cymbal tap and a hi hat
Provided by the band in the back
And Fat Jack is good for handling that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Myka 9]
We're on the freedom train so don't call me George
I'm the conductor in charge saying all aboard
There's a baby grand in the diner car by the bar
Tailor made and top grade everybody sharp
Slick hair making flips in the air and splits
Quick glances as they tap dance and take trips
Nobody ripping their pants and spit shines on their shoes
Fancy dressed women moving with that swinger attitude
So smooth....
The bartender slides over a shot of bootleg liquor
While his cigarette still steaming So cool....
When you consider the speed in which we were traveling
And the cabin was leaning
Like a chatanooga choo choo I'm an engine number 9
Notice the change in the landscape rolling down the line
Rural areas
And small towns becoming buildings all tall now
Last stop the future so go all out

[Hook]

[Aceyalone 1st Verse Repeats]

[Verse 4: Busdriver]
You hate club hopping
Still you're out and about to a destination
You need a horn player
To give you mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Because you're a fornicator
With an overdone smoker's lung
Who doesn't know what to do with her evening
Let me show you how it's done
We improvise over twelve-bar blues and held barbecues
Also weld star shoes for you to sky dance
Go and sell your car used and move to L.A
Where we make art fuse with black Bohemia
Where I live in a rat's nest but I rap fresh and the jazz fest
And everyone is so aware and astute
When we perform we're not just a bunch of arrogant flukes
I got backstage access and my catchphrase is a math test
I moisten my embrasure
They ask will you use your voice in the concert sir
And I say yes I will
Showing band leadership
I make the women feel feverish
When I'm dressed to kill

[Hook]
