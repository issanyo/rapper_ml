(Busdriver)
The muted shrills are collated in the fiery core of a netherworld you can’t ignore

Rough sketch
Of a police state:
You’re a national bird shot in the no-fly zone
Ready-made regime pulled out the styrofoam
Smug exec’s
Hand cuffed to a briefcase:
He can downsize at the push of a space bar
There are interests he must safeguard
Entrenched
In tiffs
On multi-national conglomerates
I convince
The underclass and complacent
We’re fenced
By economic pressures
And bit by bit
We remain the lesser-thans
The foul stench
Of burning dead enlisted men
It cuts through press conference double-speak
Doomsday issue raised by disgruntled geeks

The muted shrills are collated in the fiery core of a netherworld you can’t ignore

The pre-schoolers
Are turned into ground troops
So don’t believe all the stats that you see
You’re a potential black evacuee
TV bloopers resonate with an unsound truth
That there is no stratified class divide
And needs are met FEMA reps aptly provide
The moneyed machinists are priorities over all the
Hungry’s spleen fits
Capital is funneled into
War room debacles
But if you challenge them in large forums
It’s not so
Decrepit salesman claims ownership over heavenly bodies
With stubborn gun-slinger machismo
Go home
They postponed the upheaval

The muted shrills are collated in the fiery core of a netherworld you can’t ignore

Horn players’ bellies
Full of rain and soot
Horn players’ bellies
Full of rain and soot

Bloated bodies facedown in a toxic quagmire
You know the sky wept into empty groves
Then I become a live-threat when the levee goes
Horrid neglect or a systematic backfire
Yeah
Yeah I’m fresh I dress in the trendy clothes
But we’ve never been the price checked embryos

The muted shrills are collated in the fiery core of a netherworld you can’t ignore
