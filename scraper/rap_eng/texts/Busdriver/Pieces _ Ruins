[Verse 1: P.O.S]
Same dude new guts
Literal and figurative lost a couple fucks
Shit, alright fine, alright I gave 'em
Came a lotta way to play the cooler than awake game shucks
Got me
Thumper on the raglan
Johnny on the spot with an ill fitting magnum
Guns look dumb on chumps like me
No funds no fun don't move won't see
DayQuill NyQuil zzQuil sleep 'til
Peace fills ill hearts
Beats gone keep still
Yeah
Guess what
Stef's nuts
Crazy
Best luck
Chest bump
Fist won't fade me
Kicking out canes
Candy from your babies
Jumping off the top ropes
Screaming no kang me
Chandelier swangin
Table flipping OG
Pinky up sipping on a Surly Doomtree
What's up?
Same shit different animal
Same food whole different kinda cannibal
Lost on the moon
Your dude resides southside
Northeast
Northside
Yeah
Alright
Downtown
Roof top
Waiting on the sky to fall (yeah, yeah)
But I ain't heard the last of y'all
Wolf cryin
Alligator tears
With your eyes wide
Waiting for the sky to fall (alright)
Eyes wide can't see
Vision all burgundy
That or all green
Intentions all slithery
I keep mine fine tuned on the next move
Tryna dodge the sky

[Chorus:]
(Yeah, yeah, eh)
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins (yeah)
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins
They've been left in ruins
All of the places we love have been left in ruins
All of the places we love have been left

[Verse 2: Dynell Roland]
Look, I switched up my zone
It's nothing but clones
Swimming thru society
Just learning my own
Carving a legacy in this rock
But who really knows
Kicking in doors
While shooting past all of my goals
Horoscope couldn't tell you
What the hell I'mma do
Everything a murder case
But what do i lose
I prove
Snipers on the roof
Breath in let's resume
Took a gamble
While my life was in shambles
I'll never lose
Ring the alarm
Panic look how they panic
Shit runs loose
Dancing on walls
Scramble to get thru
Playing with fire devil on my ass
But not wired
Wireless to the bullshit so connection runs wild
Never fragile speak easy
Believe me (haha)
I won't get boxed in I'm not a damn tv
I need that and some
Shuffle the deck and watch me land them
Doing backflips with life I hope they stand them
Or stand me
Energy looking just like a stampede
While everything is vanishing
I hope they can find me

[Chorus:]
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins (yeah)
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins
They been left in ruins
All of the places we love have been left in ruins

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
(Um, yes sir)
I can tell a spell with the hood on my back
I can ball out and take the goods off the rack
Even though my father been hooked on crack
I can get it done
Jumping through hoops as economies slump
Vomiting them chunks 'cause the ambience sucks
Dangling the clotheslines on elephant tusks
Yeah, I can get it done, I can get it done
I wear a helmet 'cause the square is hellish
Declare the felt tip
As a way to definitely upset adults
I turn the swag to an electric pulse
Turn it up about a megavolt
As you read a post
Yeah she had that singing voice that could melt a dead bolt
But her singing in the ear always gets the best results
We used to read that new new soaking in the Epson salts
But now the hood is different and the the yuppies want the special sauce
I read insults
From the OG's bio what a mouthful
When we write the laws it's poetry by council
Sitting with my fork, and my dinner plate and knives
Thinking I can do more than just entertain whites, my spite
Blood-sugar mixing through the sugar cane'll lubricate the cotton gin
The dollar bin is full of rain
I've got a couple black geniuses in the bullet train
Bumping them big words shooting out the woodgrain, woah

[Chorus]
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins (yeah)
My hood ain't the same no more my niggas say no more all of the places we love have been left in ruins
They been left in ruins
All of the places we love have been left in ruins (ruins)
All of the places we love have been left
