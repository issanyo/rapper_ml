1st verse:
Self Jupiter

Man over board
And overlord
Man's vocal chords
Brand spoken for
Lance corporal
Fans portable
Good with the hands surgical
Bad son of mad criminal
Last Seminole
Jupiter jazz general furthermore
Bands notable
Brass circular
Greener than grass
Sitting in the temple the emperor
Laughs
So many woman and booties and grab
Tourniquets dance dirty just
Add dopamine doberman
Pincher a Gash
Blood will get splashed
Shuffle these cards with my
Fingers on blast
Under the table so business is
Brash smoldering ash
One in the chamber a sobering task
You can be killed if you're handling cash dangling meat
In my face I ma flash
Making me mad
Know one is safe when we enter the lab
Mostly are victims are usually stabbed laid on a slab
80's are back with a
Murdering cast
Snake in the grass follow my past
Looking for love and some mutiny
Yes!!!
