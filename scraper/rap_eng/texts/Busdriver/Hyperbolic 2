[Verse 1]
Sorry, sorry I got a missed call from the massage parlor
Oh shoot it’s you, fresh out of jail telling me “need to ball harder”
You don’t rap to improve, you pull a jack move on the ear and toe[?] below
With your backup you know how the story goes
So before we know, you make the party blow
What’s that? You figure we should do it just because you’re getting 14 a brick
You said this while handcuffed to a hospital bed, hooked to a morphine drip
I met your criminality, and I don’t like a bunch of grown [?] cause you don’t know right
You sold an eighth to a stranger and they had to call and quarantine the strip
Nigga, keep quiet or I’ll export you in the mix

[Hook]
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
So miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole

[Bridge]
I’m so out my place, I can hear your face
Sorry, sorry, hey
I’m so out my place, I can hear your face

[Verse 2]
Saw me back in the day, you said what's so up with these
Now you want me cause the hoes fuck with me
Now you want to go start a clothing company
Yeah right, yeah right, let me be
Bitch your smiling was real thin
So I'm licking my thumb trying to trail winds
And fuck nigga, you're in a tail spin
Thrown up in the pen by a tactful supremacist
And now you wear that Bluetooth suppository
Reading from a script with no actual premises
Abiding by the whim of an afro-fetishist
Fronting like you're rolling around fifty deep
Your homies are like sterilized chimney sweeps
I took him to the OG to get him vetted
And he said there's no gangster in your Dickies crease

[Hook]
[(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
So miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole]

[Verse 3]
While doing business on an out of town trip
You hit an undercover with a roundhouse kick
While wearing an army jacket with a thirty round clip
So miss me with that hyperbole
You shootin' niggas on accident when the phone beeps
So the character assassination is bone deep
Cause the idea is if you don’t be seen, got no reads
So fuck your hyperbole
You wanna move into an estate home
But you can't get a bank loan with a gun charge
Plus, why would you give all the crack addicts punch cards?
And fuck all that shit you do
I can only make an expensive song
When you're vetted and incredibly slender
I'm getting audited as a celebrity sinner

[Hook]
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
So miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)
Miss me with that hyperbole
(Minor, major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player)

[Outro]
Sorry, sorry, yeah
I’m so out my place, I can hear your face
