For the people who know
Deeper than hundreds-of-thousands of debt
Your couch is now wet
Here is the washcloth to wipe yourself dry
Laundering money in Laundromats
Here is detergent
Bearded Arab surgeons
Passing out cough drops
Like asking a Sasquatch to taste your Gazpacho
That's a nice watch bro
Bought it from Costco
God
I like pasta
God is a monster
Monsters are modern
Inventions forgotten
Potatoes-au-gratin
Cradle your thoughts in a stable of oxen
Thick ankles for socks and
I’ll strangle your dachshund with a Subaru Walkman

(Busdriver)
Save the little boy genius
From his self-employed zenith
But at the time I'm having car trouble
Do you have a monkey wrench
Or some money to invest
For my Mars shuttle?
I’m supposed to be reading palms
And doing tarot-card shuffles in rainfall
I’m a licensed practitioner
Correcting brain flaws
With this gas-powered chain saw
Wearing a reclaimed shawl
Are you ready to lose your virginity?

(Radioinactive) X 2
For those of us who learn to slide by on the minimum
Giving out the answers but won't discuss curriculum
Find yourself a pen-pal correspondence and go visit ‘em
Sitting on your laurels or your haunches like a businessman

(Busdriver)
I’m the protestor of the oil-slick blunder
Whose gold scepter is his toilet plunger
Save the endangered fuzzy animals from the pale-faced warmongers
Who just happened to be your forefathers
Invite us and the conspiracy theorists and furry feminists to family dinners with the grand wizards
Do not call your daddy
Dad
If he cuts your long hair and bong air with hand scissors
You’re his color copy
Do not call your mother
Mommy or your mother
Mom
If you can not tell the difference between a plate of food and a cluster bomb
This a healthy exercise in recreational paranoia

I’m in the follow van
I am the hollow man
You can not see me and
Like this graffiti can
I can’t be shaken
Look
This seat here is taken
So put some moleskin on your bunions and corns
Whether or not The Weather's running these storms
Out of the tri-county area
In a Sea Harrier
Hover when I land
And the government has planned
For a satellite
To control the patterns of The Weather
Just a sheepherder
Who controls the government with a catalytic converter
Connected to my ipod
Connected to the G4
That's loaded with 100 pounds of C4 explosive
I know exactly where your folks live
If you wanna know Radioinactive
But you oughta know
Exactly where you're headed
I said it once
I’ll say it again
I’m in the follow van
I am the hollow man
You can not see me and
