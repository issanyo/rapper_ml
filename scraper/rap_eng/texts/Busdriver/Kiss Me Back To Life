I plant a kiss on both your cheeks
We make love so you won't go to sleep
Cause your face can inspire global peace
Or leave me dead in your arms
I need to be a mogul at least
And to get that Volvo leased
Keep these hoes off my scrotal crease
To keep you in my dreams, don't set the alarm

Kiss me back to life
Cause you killed it last night
Oh, oh - let's live again! [x2]

I'm more than a boyfriend, I'm a mistake to learn from
I'm more than a boyfriend, I'm a mistake to live through

From the hurt, we won't rebound fast
But hurt is what our dreams outlast
Your friends keep talking that greenhouse gas
Why won't they believe in us?
I'm a disintegrating mass
I'm a family at mass
I'm a flag half-mast
You complete me
Let me take your hand
You're my space program

Kiss me back to life
Cause you killed it last night
Oh, oh - let's live again! [x2]

I'm more than a boyfriend, I'm a mistake to learn from
I'm more than a boyfriend, I'm a mistake to live through
