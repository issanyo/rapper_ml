[Intro/ Interlude 1]
The chef used during the seven days in which Perfect Hair was recorded cost roughly
Everything

Oh shoot (yeah)
Driver!
Ohh

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Hi, I'm Regan
I don't rap for free
And listen I’ve got a bachelors degree, but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

This year my pigment’s bluer
What am I, a crip from hoover?
Oh no, It’s a malignant tumour!
Oh, I knew it. Come on!
And still you never would admit how sick I’ve become

(Cuts to the Second Interlude)

[Interlude 2]
This is "Perfect Hair" by Busdriver
It costs .146 million US dollars to make
The musical accompaniment on tracks 5 through 12, cost 6000 euros each
The backup singers used on tracks 1 through 3, cost 3500 US dollars per take
The studio time at our home studios cost half a million Brazilian reals per lockout session

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I'm a frequent flyer
And a decent liar
And that's a lie in itself but you knew that, come on
And still you never would admit how sick I've become

I eat my food raw
Grew up bourgeois
Now I run game like a cue ball
But you knew that, come on
And so you'll never admit how sick I've become

I'm not a cool dad
Nor a new fad
I'm my daughter's own private enigma, come on
And still she never could admit how sick I've become

I'm dope as fuck
I know what's up
And I did not blow up but you knew that, come on
And so you never would admit how sick I always was

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
My clothes are dirty
And I'm over thirty
And you can't quit me cold turkey but you knew that, come on
It's about time we've admitted how sick this has become

I'm no one
And everywhere I only breathe heavy air
But you knew that, come on
Why can't we admit how sick this has become?

I used to wake up at noon
To punch the moon
And fuck my life in her puncture wound
Come on

[Outro]
Come on
