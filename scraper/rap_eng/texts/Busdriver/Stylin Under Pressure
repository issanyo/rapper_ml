[Busdriver]
Yes..

[Drive through girl]
Welcome to Carl's Junior, can I help you?

[Busdriver]
Yes, I am a head hunter
I am looking the ultimate woman sex lover
But, it's hard to stay a lie
So I had to take the next number
I can't find anybody in the dead of summer
But you know what, I think I'll have the fries

[Drive through girl]
Anything else?

[Busdriver]
Hmm.. actually, give me the Happy meal
With the rapper who doesn't have any skill
But has a contract for half a mil
Served up with a plague full of daffodils
That would do it for me!

[Drive through girl]
Okay, what would you really like to order?
Because [laughing]
What is it that you want?

[Busdriver]
Gimmie a... Hmmm.. you know what?
Give me a person burger
Because eating a hamburger
Is worse than murder
So I would prefer that

[Drive through girl]

[Busdriver]
Give me a million dollars!

[Drive through girl]
A superstar?

And... Hmm uh oh. Yes a superstar

[Drive through girl]
Okay so a superstar

Upon me with all types of digital cameras
