Electricity's on our side

[Intro]
The older put the lesson plans in the song
The money changes, credit was long
The griot believed he had the leave to be loved
Welcome back home, yes

[Verse 1]
Yo, disembodied sexy legs
Poison pills with heavy glaze
Los Angeles Getty graves
My OG was Eddie Hayes so I knew how to craft a spell
Crack, undoing our plastic shell
When you bite the styles your ass will swell
Football players as versatile apes
Blow birthday candles on a urinal cake
I don't want to hear your personal take, the elders know
A branch of motor neurons being plucked like a six-string
So your lips pucker to kiss a ring
Don't miss a thing cause

[Chorus 1]
I'm from the golden age of name-calling
So your little POV ain't ballin'
Fuck them kids under London Bridge
Way off the grid

[Verse 2]
I was just a stick in the mud
Next to the hissing sub
While slipping in, not dripping blood
From niggas trippin' soliciting drugs
I'm out of place with my mind crazy
The bougie nigga with the white lady
Give a stern look to the bigoted judge
Fight the charges, get it nipped in the bud
Build a [?] deputize all code monkeys
So the vote machines can go hungry
Or being subject to the close study of a snow buddy
No money in your hood at all
Out your block, cat call
At your inner city dancehall
Niggas ripped for mythical sources interrupting elliptical orbits
Magic guiding centripetal forces
Cause a stir of biblical proportions
Tucker the tools to the end of your horse trips
Getting offers from corporate courtships
But you always fuck it up
Cause that artist-run label was our father table
Where we dethrone your Clark Gable
Organize verbally under that Leimert Park fable, damn

[Chorus 2]
One, two
I'm from the golden age of name-calling
So your little POV ain't ballin'
Let's skip that wench on the Los Angeles audition bench
Let's do this shit until our teeth fall in
The world laughs in flowers
The world laughs in flowers
Grooves of my mind 'bout the size of a world
The world laughs

[Outro]
The world laughs
The world laughs
The world laughs
You give a stern look to the bigoted judge
Fight the charges, get it nipped in the bud
