[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I submerged my aura
Yah I was skinny-dipping
Back when I wasn't big
And couldn't pull any vixen
I lured myself
Without that sexy vision
And I spent time
Never penny-pinching
So I never slept with skanks
I saw electric thanks
No walk in septic tanks
But no feelings: expressions blank
My heart's engorged
This is where art is forged
In Snake Lake my body turns to cardboard
And my mind floats
Past the slime and moats
Watch me exercise
The powers I woke
I pour my essence
Into your moist palms
Point to the flagpole
Where we safely hoist songs
Dancing out of place like I was a soybomb
Oh shoot, shit!
Yeah! Hellfyre is goin...

[Hook: Tera Melos]
By the shores of great Snake Lake
Is where I used to stay
It's where I saw the brain
The colour was a shade
By the shores of great Snake Lake
Is where I used to stay
It's where I saw the brain
The colour was a shade

[Verse 2: milo]
I can still recall when I was the King of Carrot Flowers
But now I'm an ersatz coward
Ejaculating over rock prose by the hour
A nasty dude with a misplaced passion for passion fruit
An embarrassing rash, and a stash of lube, eww!
I'm fourteen still
And every morning is marked by an acne pill
Don't ask me what my paintings mean
I'm an angst machine and strengthening
I like musical theatre
KOOL A.D.'s my favourite because he looks weirder
I do not play type end
I have invested my meagre stipend
To a Magic: The Gathering starter pack
I was called a nerd but I'm not bothered with that
I think all people who play sports are wack
My voice might crack in the middle of a diatribe
I'm kinda shy, and I've developed a hunch-back from this knapsack
Undetected bouts of melancholy have slipped past
I hate dodgeball day in gym class
My thin legs are two ashy pistons
This girl in class needs to affirm my existence (Busdriver: pop, pop, pop)
I came to age...

[Hook: Tera Melos]
By the shores of great Snake Lake
Is where I used to stay
It's where I saw the brain
The colour was a shade
By the shores of great Snake Lake
Is where I used to stay
It's where I saw the brain
The colour was a shade
On the shores of big snake lake
The magic fans the flames
Where everybody says
The shadows shift in shapes
