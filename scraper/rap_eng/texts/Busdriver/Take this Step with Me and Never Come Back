[Busdriver]
With one bill in a clenched fist
They told me I need to get rich or try dying
Try dying

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
America’s intestinal walls are bleeding
Thank conservative fringe groups
They sling chimp poop up at the town hall meeting
But so what this is Groudhog evening
When I tend to the 86’d pupa against some gradient of fuchsia
When it slides to grayscale we just raise hell and threaten your safety with a loofah
I’m gonna die in this music pub
But first I’m gonna insist that this doofus budge
I don’t pop champagne I pop the mucus plug
My head marked with a bluish smudge
As I add to this key card collage
We don’t have no three-car garage
Just a perpetual lack of dopamine, I fall in the parenthetical black you go between
So I’m like ‘fuck your artist roster!’
To everyone of these target shoppers
I am well-respected, I am Jarvis Cocker
Give me my French duvet and crème brulee
Or I’ll ejaculate on grandma’s shoes and exacerbate the camera crew
With cartwheel yoga
I fart on teal sofas every time I botch the art deals in Dakota
I’m dead after this so raise the roof like a debt ceiling, I’m indebt to saline
My billing cycle feels like death dealing
At the funeral parlor my suit of armor’s homespun
I spent a chunk of time poking fun at the sluggish response to a smoking gun
Treated my twenties like I was in Logan’s Run
I turned thirty then awoke in chum
With strained tonsils one game console and broken thumbs
Good one Driver, hole in one

[Hook: Terra Lopez] (x3)
If I take this step I’ll sink in the black
Won’t you take this step with me and never come back

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
I’m an opponent to companionship like I endangered the housecat
I should put a disclaimer on my soundtrack
Right after I handcuff this Swiss banker to a towel rack
Because it’ll take a few millennia to pay off any future student loan
I’m a domineering dad in an abusive home
To keep warm I street perform with a sousaphone
Now I’m sipping on some arsenic tea
Bouncing babies on my arthritic knee
Crashing on the floor of a carpeted sea life don’t imitate art, nigga
Art mimics me
But this wasn’t my ideal plan
I should put a pine needle to my pineal gland
Rather than to hang high from a ceiling fan
Getting eulogy quotes from my real fans
I told my baby mama fuck off, nice move
My social graces on some vintage Ice Cube
My heart is a lunchbox filled with dry food
Titillated by the side boob I can’t tie shoes
Before I lay on the palette of the sea monster
Looking like BellBivDevoe eating peach cobbler
They know my pelvic bone sprouts Ewok fur
And my raps don’t sell vitamin water
I can’t buy the flyest flying saucer
I’m a high-flying sci-fi author
No you’re not, you’re barely a sexy mess
It’s my last show so it better be fresh
And of-the-moment like celebrity death
After it women run for a pregnancy test
And the biters get charged with identity theft
(laughs) Because Driver was tight
On his last go ’round he broke ground with every step

[Hook: Terra Lopez] (x3)
If I take this step I’ll sink in the black
Won’t you take this step with me and never come back

[Busdriver]
With one bill in a clenched fist
They told me I need to get rich or try dying
Try dying
