[Verse I]
I've got a series of beefs and cues from the bemused funkery
Riding emus in a halter tee
She's chasing her P's and Q's for the shimmying dollar tree
My defused metabolic key
It's not a studded muffins
Or be-speckled and blaxploited
I begrudged an onion
Holding teakettles like asteroid bits
There's no way I'd date her
Acting like an eighth-grader
I should have my face lasered
I was putting a wad of genetic material
Into every other jelly bag
When you exit wasted
Pirouetting on the helipad
The sound of bank mergers for the underpaid workers
And the frankfurters in deadly hands
So her tentacles look just like a purple mollusk
My dissension is imminent and parabolic
Many of the sexes are fixed in prelims
Dimples with candy tips and a landing strip
And like an X-Mas tree trimmed
And I'm serving a person burger speaking against a third term
With my parasol ripped
Look at those meaty thighs would be be CGI'd
Who else goes to career day with a "B" word seismographed
With a marshmallow suit made of fiberglass
And a name tag saying "No one did ask"
A token black typecast in my exasperated death
I should probably set up a resized JPEG
Of my Wienerschnitzel hut, instead
I sell her an ad for a defried page head
Now I'm too fickle, my heart's peanut brittle
And if it don't amount to the findings in the Concord
I should be spiking the punch bowl
To make these hussies more cooperative
Her name is (name is, name is, name name name name name...)

[Hook]
Ellen Disingenuous
She's of the best elk
Her sexy breast milk's
So good
It's so strenuous
To make Neo-feminism palatable
Ellen Disingenuous
She's screen-tested
So you know
You see her pink flesh delving the void
It's so strenuous
To make her grand disexuality work

[Verse II]
For every uncle with a Terabithia jaunt
When I wear my trivial ankh
To chaperon your lovely Milk Duds
My credit build-ups
Our committee is swamped
And the druggie's pill cup
But I lunge at her with a sponge loofah
And a cannon-powered that she bazooka
You're an incubator built for a young pupa
But I mishandled the money shot
It's tantric and pampered
A big [?] at your scrunchy spa
You're a man-eater
When you get to nibble on your bloody spot
Turn on my lights into a Telenovela
I'm a helluva fella
With a profile pic like cocaine uranium
What's your name again
What's your name again
What's your name...
I've had my fill
Of the comment fowl with the bone density of under pressure
Full-bodied chicken strips
I am like "tsk tsk."
I could paint a strip
Of your home pregnancy test royal blue
Tesla coil fuse blew
Your tummy turns
In a seafood stew
And be who do
Plus I saw Calvin Klein and David Newsmaker
My figurative outline issued their induced labor
P-funk She-Hulk
Fitted a shoegazer for a box of bits
And hunted pit bulls as foster kids
Oh why did this hussie trip
Encourage her to [?]
On the bicycle
For a incidental pregnancy acquittal
But her respect's ballin'
I'm crestfallen...what's your name again?
Oh yeah it's

[Hook]
