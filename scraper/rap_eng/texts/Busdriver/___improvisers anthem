[Intro]
I've completely lost my way
Let's make it up as we go along and see what happens

[Chorus]
Locked in a groove, under a spell
Counting up your mail, the deal is dealt
But they can't tell, so do you (So do you)
'Cause you is right (You is right)
Stop making it difficult for no reason
And just make it up on the spot (Spot)
Make it up on the spot
Make it up on the spot
There's only one thing that I know
And that is make it up on the go (Spot)
Make it up on the spot
Make it up on the spot
There's only one thing that I know
And that is make it up on the go, uh
But what about the time in life when booties droop
We probably gonna need a fool that's future-proof
All my dudes, yeah, we form a supergroup
And y'all niggas just hula hoop, ooh
But what about the time in life when titties sag
We probably gonna give it up and wave the flag
Take my heart home in a paper bag and think about the days we had
One, two

[Interlude]
Yo, we just make it up

[Verse 1]
Met this girl named Suzie Q
I said how do you do
I'm Driver, I'm cruising through
I'm difficult like a Rubik's cube
Let's find something new to do
Oh you gotta do with you
I react on a music queue
And turn blue as a tuba blew
But on that subsequent week
I peeped her subtle hint
On stage where I hustle rent
Reactions made her husband wince
We hopped off that [?] bitch
And said nigga, I'll bust your shit
Security adjusts his [?]
He got booted and people rooted
I took Suzie on the couch
She apologized, said you're cute
And that they were on the outs
Is that so, twist and grow[?]
I said drinks are on the house
Ride on chorus[?] to the light forest[??]
Just spewed from them water spouts
I just make it up as I go along
Them new styles be standardized
Them new crews be on standby
My Manhattan pan-African Eurasians with them slanted eyes
Want me to expand the sky
So I put my hands up high
I impromptu that new [?]
That can deny us[?]
My writer looks like a botanist startup kit
I was caught up in that shit
But now I got my bars up, bitch
I was caught up in a twist
But now I got my bars up, bitch

[Chorus]
Locked in a groove, under a spell
Counting up your mail, the deal is dealt
But they can't tell, so do you (So do you)
'Cause you is right (You is right)
Stop making it difficult for no reason
And just make it up on the spot (Spot)
Make it up on the spot
Make it up on the spot
There's only one thing that I know
And that is make it up on the go (Spot)
Make it up on the spot
Make it up on the spot
There's only one thing that I know
And that is make it up on the go, uh
But what about the time in life when booties droop
We probably gonna need a fool that's future-proof
All my dudes, yeah, we form a supergroup
And y'all niggas just hula hoop, ooh
But what about the time in life when titties sag
We probably gonna give it up and wave the flag
Take my heart home in a paper bag and think about the days we had
One, two

[Interlude]
We been going free this whole time
Floating above everybody, looking down

[Verse 2]
From here to Baltimore [?]
We crawling on all fours
And you always got to guard the room
Due to shit winning[?] they opportune
Oxygen for the [?]
[?]
See you gotta put the numbers up and really[?]
Most coveted lovers be like leave it to me
So we put a different hue inside the color scheme
But now I gotta tell everybody in detail just what it means
They know a logical anomaly that's ad hominem[?]
Acts like a bodily function funeral gumption
Make it up as you go along
[?] dry pavement, dealing with high pigment
And they put it in skyscrapers
And interpret it under the sign language
Telling me I constructed pyramids
When they think I fly aimless
So I got to peace out, 'cause you play the game on some hater shit
During that weight gain, turned my stage name to an algebraic glyph
Improvising in slow-mo, my every solo's a calculated risk
Jazz militants take over on television you can smell the chicken on your laser disk
[?] 'cause your health's in greater risk
So we putting on pointy shoes with razor tips, yeah

[Outro]
We have to turn this into what it's supposed to be
We have to turn this into what it's supposed to be
Jerry-rigged the shit, my nig
Let's go
From here to Baltimore [?]
