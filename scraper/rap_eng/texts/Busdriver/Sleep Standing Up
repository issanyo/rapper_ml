Sleep Standing Up

Busdriver And Radioinactve:
We are here
You are there
We are weird
We pull hair and shed our skin
Don’t let us in the evil lair
We are here
Now we’re there
This is a broken dream
A smoke screen for baseball teams who use facial creams
In case you’ve seen this movie trailer
What do you mail your new free jailbirds? Cigarettes
Tylenol
Cup-of-noodles
Pornography
Malcolm X’s biography
A new ski mask for the robbery
And a photo copy of a groupie’s ass

Busdriver And Radioinactve:
When we sleep standing-up
Bed-frame shoes
Head-board hats
Pillow earmuffs
Bed-sheet shirts
When we sleep standing-up
Up-side down in a cave wearing pants made from dream fabric woven from a jean-jacket worn by Christ
Orange-lime slice
Pork-fried rice
I have courtside seats
Of course I sleep where I want
And I talk in the rarest font
Share a croissant with your American aunt
Get married in a mosque and get buried in a box
And that’s it
Your life’s over
Comeback as my blind chauffeur
I offer to a kind ogre and an Ayatollah this diet-soda from Oklahoma
Heretic Mork and Mindy
American Indian carries oblivion
In the back pocket of every bohemian is a museum where bitter comedians litter the stadium with one-liner paper airplanes taping their names
