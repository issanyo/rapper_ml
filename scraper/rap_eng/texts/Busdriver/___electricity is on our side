[Intro]
Give a shout out to JMD and the Underground Railroad
Doin' the most for hip hop and jazz!
The most...
We know the story
Brothers not in pain for work that they do
Brothers really want that to happen again, so
What's up to mass man, ghetto guys in the house too somewhere
But, um, Fat Jacks CBE
Hip Hop Klan, fuck your tram, Big Aisle, Chew, (pause it)
Hip hop in the house

[Verse 1]
I can see the worry behind your eyes
You opened a place unlike
For you do not know where the decisions that you make
Are without bearing in the end
But rest assured, my friend
You are the one at the beating heart of our sky's sun
You don't want to know the way you are
How you glow, how you go about your day
But when did you harness sunlight
And electricity stays on your side
Even if you don't have a thing
So that I'll [?] poetry to alter your pathetic leanings
With the double meanings, I'll throw the proceedings and now you know
Who were they to tie to my search of mind as yours
Galaxies unfurled, children born from our fire
Swept up in technologies, that we don't control, condone, uphold

[Verse 2]
Paintings of Marseille rush to your canvas at all
Let the cuts [?] we craze, you arrive to welcome guests
Here is where you make an argument for [?]
And other rarities that lack a piece of nerve
The decent work not psychotherapy
I'll guide you through the three-sided dream
Cause I can see the pain behind your eyes
Master teacher, use the star maps as tablecloth, of course she did
The drum as a conduit of love
Most of us understand how to reach it up above

[Interlude]
Thank you, brothers
Thank you, bless you
Nah brother, I'm good
I sing and I do poems
I sing- keep playing brother
I'm just here to watch you

[Verse 3]
Nothing suddenly, something's here
The time has come to wander childrens' dreams
And what they all mean to the world that we all live in
We only breathe heavy air [?] brought this penny-aire
Through the thick and thin

[Outro]
What you sellin', brother?
How you doin' with that news?
I'm playin' here
Back brother, I'll let you do your thing
I just wanna let you know that you special
Don't let these terrible [bleep] make you feel less...
[?] grace of God
Yeah man, I know I'm mad, I know I'm mad
I'm going here to just tell them, let them know I feel about them
You know what I mean?
I'm good, I'm [?]  brother, respect, always
God damn it, fuck these [bleep], man!
