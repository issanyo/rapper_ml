[Eligh:]

(Welcome to Los Angeles)

[Busdriver:]

Your phones better be live, we eat the depleted
Your hairline over the years completely receded
You’re in Beverly Hills working at a boutique
After trying to make it as an actor for about two weeks

You thought you’d get a role in a sitcom at a verbal commitment
Now your Danny DeVito’s personal assistant
You’re working under per-popup-pictures enormous boner
Nigga you’re an organ donor

(Welcome to LA)

While you dreaming about becoming a movie star
I’m having a power-meeting over at the sushi bar
Your comedy routine is old as dragging tits
Besides there’s no black motherfuckers playing protagonists

Unless you’re going to have an affair with Tyler Perry
Driver carries weight cause I am LA
My white blood cells are gang bangers
That scar on my nipple, that’s kuwanger

[Chorus:]

LA LA x8

[Eligh:]

(And the city split apart and two angels fell down with dirty wings to help the struggling people on the streets looking for light.)

Sun-kissed, sun-sprayed, look at the way I serenade
City of angels hangover since there were renegades
Bigot liggers, bootleggers and fingers in the lemonade
Living la vida loca from Echo Park to the Palisades
Sensei, take a chop for the hunted that is LA
On my best day I move with through traffic like a master marker
Then meditate a state equated fake can never bless a man like me
Cause I’m a manatee, underwater sea-life
My lavatory you rewrite in my absence
The city you love is the best for reconstructing Eligh
Yeah, he is not the pedigree
A chase I’d like to be with the people fake
To pace a face a vase I break your picket motherfucker
Take your brick and jump on a dee
Liquid a cake, dodger the lake
Where the beat break that heat seeks
And sweet treats acidicly live online
Freak geeks like being in a bus peep peep
Don’t sleep on the city of angels its just us in this

[Chorus:]

LA LA x8

[Outro:]

Dreamers dream on
Don’t let the city break you
Dreamers dream on
Don’t let your dreams die
Dream on
Dream on
