[Intro]
Straight out of the wrong side of Leimert Park, this is the beginning of Equiano ultra

[Verse 1]
Equiano, a great leader
I got a start in Hollywood impersonating Jesus, playing Weezer
And now he stars in motion pictures for the white slavers
The main feature but he's Saint Peter, so benevolent
While bigots don't weather the blow backs
The initial cavities in snow caps
I want to start beat up aggressive scenes, never secure about their recessive genes
And I'm dressing clean, I develop my dreams in the same house my homie sold at, and you should know that
My niggas are ideologues logging on the saber rattle
So they not worth to you, we do not work for you
Yep, I came up on your favorite channel
So just watch us nigga, yeah
Let's go

[Hook]
I got that work, I got that free labor
So get at me later
I got them clean papers
I'm major
I got that work, I got that free labor
Get at me later
I'm full of weed vapor
I'm major

[Verse 2]
More work than you can quantify
Economists, they don't even want to try
I want to grab your brain, trying to catch my breath
While the powers that be exact my death
And never be angered by the anti-theft
Unless I agree to be a corporate sojourn
Change my ways to worship a proven
Take a lot of money so I forfeit a move ooh! Yeah!
But I don't got to do it, made a movie that they're playing in a multiplex
On the borderly of the Boeing jet
Still treble clefs on the dollar signs over my embezzled debt
Man, how can we restructure everything to keep the OGs set?
Y'all know the deal, relations all like happy whites 'cause they don't respect our body rights
And the militants of fascism spread like a zombie bite
And then the crown came between as the matter of crabs
How does Viacom keep this head of the staff against traffic drafts?
How can I speak to the scene as they amass
When the capitalist class plays capture the flag with basic needs
Stopped and frisked that's the racist need
I'm in a state of constantly dangerous greed so swap out them ABC's with 0's and 1's
And them euros well done
So nombre nah, them empirical Johns
[?] and I do satirical puns, but no, homie they're there
They're very brave so, so I don't misbehave

[Hook]
I got that work, I got that free labor
So get at me later
I got my clean papers
So major
I got that work, I got that free labor
Get at me later
I'm full of weed vapor
I'm major

[Bridge]
I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
I'm major, I'm major, I'm major, I'm major
Give me that work, yeah, give it up for free
So what? You're owed a hundred years of dividends and fees
And dance for my children, swinging from a tree
Dance for my children, swinging from a tree
(So far, I get up
So far, I get it up)

[Outro]
I don't need your mother fucking advice bitch nigga, now get the fuck out of my face before I sell your mother fucking ass for some cigarettes, bitch ass nigga. You want some advice? Put a fucking dress on, bitch motherfucker
