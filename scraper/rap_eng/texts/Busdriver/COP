I want to be a cop
Can you keep your lips sealed
I think my leadership skills can turn low- level offenders into crisp
Bills, you know I've always wanted to be a
Cop
With a uniform fit with colonists' seams
Peeing in niggas collard greens as they discuss politics of dreams this why I've always wanted to be a cop
So I can criminalize the gate of your stroll, the shade of mole
And take a tole
A displaced dark face is safe as an ace in the hole for a cop
As good as I , I'll book a guy drinking crooked I
Don't resist pudding pie, you think I won't buy why wouldn't I
I'm a cop
Everything you do is actionable intel
Giving NSA search words wind sails, step in jail
When I'm a finally a cop
You'll be indicted for showing PDA in a PDF
And the PDJ sold from the tvset
Chemically discourages your graffiti sketch
I'm a cop "god's an over-advertised lie"

I'm a cop "god's an over-advertised lie"

I'm a cop "god's an over-advertised lie"

You're a cop "god's an over-advertised lie"

When I'm a cop, I'll be like back down kids
Issuing Black Power digs at cacao nibs
Cool them niggas off with a blacked out grids
When I'm a cop, I'll have to impersonate your online paramour, across time we will share the war
Between cultural anomalies seeping into the arid pore
When you're a cop, you can torment freely, in Semi Valley
Then seize an Audi and beam proudly
Turn a routine traffic stop into someone's season finale
When you a cop
You can shoot a motherfucker, by the trailer park
Planting evidence your defense would razor sharp
Then turn around and taze a perp for blazing purp

I'm a cop
