Less Yes's, more No's, and less Yes's, More No's and less Yes'sâ€¦

A studio audience's general anesthesia itch
Remedied by "chop sui generis" the seminal sleeper hit
From this tag-banger doppelganger
Turned a non-partisan anti-hero
And the sneaker fits
I'm undeniably left-leaning others got cold feet
It's because they're breast-feeding
On this golden teat (of an old elite)
This synthetic mammary gland
Of a pop-cult nurse aid in a birdcage
Which is actually an Iraqi oil drum
Mistaken as the divine mother by daddy's spoiled son
That's why you die in high numbers
For this populous Texan and his innocuous yes-men
You're a compliant spyhunter
Fresh dried-blood globules on dog tags
Are like scarlet opals

Exchanged for fossil fuels
So I charge rigged voting poles
Cuz the day's autumn hues lie
On a garbage boats on shoals
And an estranged god rules
Urging soccer mom's to want to carpet bomb
A peace rally on your campus quad
Watch as an Islamic phantom god
Is slain by a movie star
In a red, white and blue unitard
On a Fox news sister station
On cue insipid patrons soft-shoe

We refuse the ruling class in broadcast antennae headdresses
With more no's and less yes's
Recon in war zones is your certain death sentence
So we need more no's and less yes's
I'll unzip the sky and reveal
The inner-workings that are hidden
With more no's and less yes's
More no's and less yes's
More no's and less yes's

Every feather a boarding pass
For the fluorescent shuttle soaring past
Forged from remnants of a former me
A hollow bulb that died of the common cold
And you lack the language to appraise
What was my fleshy housing due to my
Wild fling with the art scene underbelly
I, a style king toiled over a volley of
Ideas and scrutinized today's news
But I've now been reduced to super-sized plates of food
And even this supposed headspace
That hemorrhages with a carbonated fizz
Is auctioned off for bargain rated bids
A sugary glaze is applied to every
Unfertilized seedling that my dementia approves
Every aroused spoof
Now childproof
Every emphatic 'no'
Now an ambivalent 'yes'

As you know they're arbitrarily assigned an Axis of Evil
But it can't be remedied by my on-campus free show
I would hyper-extend this Californian cactus needle
To snag rifle straps and also stab vinyl stacks
But it's used to inject botox in the cheeks of big-face bills
And I with chipped paint in my gills
Know that elected official and lobbyist have hid waste spills
And also misplaced kills
But in the face of that neo-con Nazi
I am no Noam Chomsky
I'm a nagging teen in baggy jeans
Who fixates on frills as bombs drop free
Yes we're embalmed zombies
Getting all s#%tfaced as interest-rates build on defense shares
But no homie, I'll die voicing my grievances
Give the bronze urn of this naysayer
To the modern-day Quaker
The long-term of your slave labor
Has been discontinued
This quick-tongue ginsus right-wing filibusters

We refuse the ruling class in broadcast antennae headdresses
With more no's and less yes's
Recon in war zones in your certain death sentence
So we need more no's and less yes's
I'll unzip the sky and reveal the inner-working that are hidden
With more no's and less yes's
More no's and less yes's
More no's and less yes's
