[Intro: milo]
I was on the roof
Pretending to be Hercules
When it came to the truth
I was Icarus with dirty knees

Son of a master craftsman
Always keeping in mind disaster is a moving action
A creative effort to be destructive
Destro reminded me I'm the carton I kept my lunch in

[Body: milo]
In the Mall of America with blue balls
I guess my new rap name could be 'Two Shawls'
Lou Rawls of the goofballs

Mumbling coherently
A bummer most apparently
Whittled fletchings
Little etchings of past successes
I don't need to know your dad's last addresses
A digression about infinite regresses
And regrets about breasteses

Is this not unlike having chicken pox?
A coin jar labeled for the purchase of dinner socks
We could still be toy box pals
Just don't forget to boycott Sal's

Jasmine, aloe and hibiscus
Tore your meniscus when you board the discus
Having long hair is no longer an important statement

[Outro: milo]
I was on the roof
Pretending to be Hercules
When it came to the truth
I was Icarus with dirty knees

Son of a master craftsman
Always keeping in mind disaster is a moving action
A creative effort to be destructive
Destro reminded me I'm the carton I kept my lunch in

Not afraid to get my face punched in
Regarding dispute over a dust bin
Atlas Shrugged while i sneezed
Remember to give your mother several hugs for me please
