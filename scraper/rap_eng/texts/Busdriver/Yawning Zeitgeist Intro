Hello, I'm conducting a survey
And I have some questions to ask you
First off, do you have a fear of a black tangent?
Were you born in the year of the rat
Do you cheer and clap when weird rap bands commence?

I can tell by your answer you probably won't frolic with me in the foothills
And that you want your tofu patty cooked, not grilled
But it doesn't matter
You've been enticed
And drawn in with my hook and reel

(Buy my written works)
Oprah nods my novel
(Buy my written works)
As you can see, it sells very prominently in Boulder Colorado

L-O-L, laugh out loud
You've never known hell
So well how do you identify with a black crowd?
It's "Fear of a black tangent," idiot
A public enemy spoof

Now some of your friends will reboot the computer
Then do a Google search
And be discouraged when they find out
That the truth will hurt
When they see that I am not their zeitgeist
Nor am I Christ-like
Nor do I dislike whites
I just want a better chance
Cause most likely I'll sell more records in France
