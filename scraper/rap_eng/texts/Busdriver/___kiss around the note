[Intro]
Electricity is on my side (yes)
Electricity is on our side (yes)
Let me show you how I do it
Let me show you what I learned
We came through, uh

[Verse 1]
Oh, we came came through
The new component with the X's on it
Lighting bolts and shot glasses
Hot molasses and red cobras that deadly potent
So what is it?
You'd like to know when that private showing
A wink-wink and a head nod
A room key and that eggnog
Well it's mind blowin'
And you ain't ready
The study group here stays sweaty
Wakanda flower and rock starts and that body rock that's way heavy
But you don't get it
In a secret session
My beat is questioned and my card declined
So I nake or break [?] that nude new
Its software stays far behind
And you starry-eyed
And you style-biting outright
I caught you jockin' licking your chops
Phone out, mind helpless
To the psychedelics and you zone out
With your pig snout
Drawn towards my plate o' greens
Like how'd you navigate that naked dream
Huh?
Did you feed the kids, did you eat to live?
Tell me soldier [?] now bowl of poetry [?]
I'll tell you for a consultant fee, how I do it

[Hook]
Ooh, I kissed around them notes
When everybody in the city done forgotten how to hope
I come through that cloud of smoke, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes
And rebuilt this world one building at a time, when I'm around my folks, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes
When everybody in the city done forgotten how to hope
I come through that cloud of smoke, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes
And rebuilt this world one building at a time, when I'm around

[Verse 2]
He's done paid the quote
For a one-way ticket on the slave boat
With a set of ribs like a xylophone
In the servant quarters in a private home
With a vagina zone for the patriarchy
My job title was still crazy darky
[?] staple center[?]
My African ties to the epicenter
With the public speaker saying it's getting better
Is that Batista with a vendetta
[?] discard the letter of a realtor[?]
But the guy who's real as her
[?] as I zero in
At Central Park with a Pokemon
At Adobe dens[?] with great thinkers
Just binge drinkers
Using beer bottles as bowling pins
Stomach growl for them sober noodles
Rich niggas got no scruples
Represent for those clever gents
Who throw lemons under their trash heap
When they up the rep of those of a Mexican descent
And you form a critique
I pick at the weak for them social ills
'Cause this street is just "post no bills", like uh

[Interlude]
I've always known how to make it real

[Bridge]
Ooh, I kissed around them notes (I make it real, I make it real)
Kiss around them notes (I make it real)

[Hook]
Ooh, I kissed around them notes (I make it)
When everybody in the city done forgotten how to hope
I come through that cloud of smoke, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes (I make it)
And rebuilt this world one building at a time, when I'm around my folks, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes (I make it)
When everybody in the city done forgotten how to hope
I come through that cloud of smoke, like
Ooh, see, I kissed around them notes (I make it)
And rebuilt this world one building at a time, when I'm around my folks

[Outro]
Bend my notes around the frame
Transcending the smoke from a pound of sage
Bend my notes around, around
Bend my notes around the frame
Bending [?] into a new man[?]
Stretch time so they speed up
With the [?]
Make the murals all water based
Bending [?] into a new man[?]
Stretch time so they speed up
With the [?]
Make the murals all water based
Bending [?] into a new man[?]
Bending
