DJ Furry

(Busdriver)
I should have won them million doll hairs
But I left my wings in the car
Parked in the pet-rock petting zoo's tow-away zone
So I miss karaoke night at the old-age home

(Radioinactive)
She blows the ancient wisdom whistle
Painting a crystal across your forehead in a Santa Monica semi-automatic toothbrush pistol horse-sled
Force-fed horse heads and ginseng
Hitting Satan with the sacred lovebeams
Saving all my dividends
Send them to the drugstore's bloodstream
Your cold sores
They daydream
Tonight the topic is making love on top of the Asian shrub that grows in caves and stuff
Fertility pillow for filling the weeping willow by keeping the lubricant level from lifting from Cape Canaveral with paper-thin gravel
I drink it with apple juice for beneficial bathroom use
Medieval salsa jousting
Hitting Joan of Arc with the lambada darts is the common-law
Latin rhythm
Doctor Atkins vision eyeglasses
Low Carburetor of the Lost Ark
Discard the creator's pop tart when it pops up and singes your eyelashes
Agatha Christie crafty craftmatic grass magic fertilizing mystery comfort optometrist firefighter
Using a pair of wire cutters to fire butlers when they just don’t cut it

(Busdriver)
Making a rock star face in a box-car race
Childish prank
Easter egg bunny hunt
Shave the doll to fund the meter maid’s tummy-tuck
My salsa chips are dipped in plasma
I’ll call it quits
Feed the vending machine a million doll hairs to bribe the ball-bearers

(Busdriver)
I should have won them million doll hairs
But I left my wings in the car
Parked in the pet-rock petting zoo's tow-away zone
So I miss karaoke night at the old-age home
