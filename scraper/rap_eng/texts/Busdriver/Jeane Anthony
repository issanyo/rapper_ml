[Intro]
Yo
You know our love's eternal
Where was the first place you fell in love
And you would go and [?] place exists
Does the [?] have an [?] place
Electricity dancing on your fingertips
Like the sacred myth

[Verse 1]
The medicine man at the refugee camp
So negotiate your well-being with a plant
Spliff burning over the guitar amp
No love for the rewards and their grants
We don't need that stamp
The shaman reeks of the homemade moonshine
'Cause how we live, there's always a food line
But you're new to the grind
Melt down your belongings to them golden tokens
'Cause we've been ice skating on these frozen oceans
But let me ask you this
Have you been engrossed by a wish
Grabbing your lover by the wrist
Saying I insist
We are on the cusp of bliss
Let's just suck on the wisp[??]
Look up from the abyss
Black people loaded with the gift
Greens on my salad fork tip
Violent dork shit
Violent dork shit
Uh, c'mon
We can be indifferent to the rich
Round the world in a round trip
How do I exists
Avocado fats on my lips
Styles get [?] on a pit
Ninety-four click
Genocide's a grocery list
Pathogens loaned in a kiss
My lady is the shit
Yeah, she knows what a whip[?]

[Chorus]
For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
Girl, you know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love
Yo, let's get it

[Verse 2]
The jazz man at the unemployment office
He pointed out them allies in a woman's carcass
The pharaohs lined up in them wooden coffins
They didn't die from flash floods in mid-August
But let me ask you this
Have you been engulfed in a flame
Wonder from where it all came
[?] called out your name
How you keep the brawl contained
When you're so small in the game
In the halls of pain
Jazz man exhausted in vain
Whole life tossed in the drain
Man, he crossed out your name
Nah, fuck that
C'mon, yeah
But now you fell in love on a whim
Life on the bubbling rim
Homies dunked in the bin
You let your muscles get thin
Remember how Jeane used to store that shovel in the den[?]
Let me show you where it all began
Writing out styles in the trim on the aerosol can
I think you felt it drip from the source
Praise[?] getting whipped like a horse
Had to stick up a Porsche

[Chorus]
For Jeane Anthony Ray
Beyond gravity's sway
You know our love's eternal
'Cause we know your love

[Outro]
You know the world better than anyone
Show me the true science of the sun
And where we all come from
You know the world better than anyone
Show me the true science of the sun
And where we all come from
You know the world better than anyone
Show me the true science of the sun
And where we all come from
