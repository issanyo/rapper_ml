Hi it’s me
The Anarchist Bowling League team captain
Exactly why all of your dreams happen
Assign your ideals to extreme passions
Regimes and factions
Little greens and black ones
Open-minded student union targeted with laser sights
While they nature hike
For peace action
I jump in discussion with anti-American sentiment you don’t prescribe to

We’ll cough up the man made sky-trash
They’ll celebrate put champagne in a wine glass
We must renovate the campaign finance
Awareness can’t be swayed with shock and awe

Crisis?
What crisis?
Code red
Code orange
Code yellow
Code pink
Don’t think
Just nod in agreement
A finger’s force behind that button pressed
Can have an infant’s head bludgeoned to death
We’ve all fallen victim to the secretary of defense’s onion breath
Sudden steps to taken civil liberties away from your little chickadees
Lashing fork-tongues bathe the warm guns
So eat your freedom fries with the democracy spread
But when you look closely you see it’s just a maelstrom of cow dung

Blood thirsty Americans
We will recycle media coverage with an encyclopedia of rubbish
So that we can put bayonets on our fountain pen
And send away cadets so that powerful men’s needs can be met
Accept the manufactured consent and its candy wrapper content
But not me because your vinyl jacket will not drape over my spinal bracket
I’m the mindful lab chimp
They poke and pry and my open-eye
Hoping that my tear ducts leak their precious paint thinner
'Cuz when it comes to imagery flashfloods I’m a great swimmer
And the average American is a pragmatic sloth who thinks they care honestly
When the air quality’s given them an asthmatic cough
We have seen the outrageous claims made by the pre-recorded synthetic voice of the chief of staff
Turn even a mild-mannered housewife into a warhead wrangler
And the reason we have
Is that there’s a looming threat from an invented evildoer
Watch the confident consumers cower
There’s war because there is no other dominant superpower
