Have you read the drivers manual?
What do you think of it?
Do you find it useful in piloting your hyperactive particle accelerating hovercraft
Made for the elitist gentry and upper class — wait a minute! This is the wrong booklet!

Oh here it is
Have you read this driver's manual?
Oh you have
But you'd like to exchange yours for another because yours seems to bear the teeth marks of a biter's mandibles—
Uh oh, wait a minute
Somebody beat you to it
Somebody got a head start!

You know that my astral projection has stretch marks and where I hear a wack tape I tend to lactate a milk that's lukewarm
Or I'm reluctant of feeling the guilt of tooting my own horn but I think I've killed my newborn
But I didn't mean to
It ran away from home and was starring in nude porn
And I... and I was so pissed off I stabbed it with my shoehorn
And burnt it using the ashes of my fertilized growing blue corn
Which is used to feed my unicorn
Which is actually the ideologies of viewers in TV Land in its true form

But what have I done?
What have I done?
