[Intro]
I do my thing
Presenting Equiano Ultra

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I do my thing, the computer screen is a silent church
Conduct business under the pretense of a private search
I'm Black so selling crack is my defacto summer job
Buying power indivisible, under God
The red line hoods used like a battle lab
And you came with refined goods and a saddlebag
Everybody's been on gridlock
We know that your aim's got ample swag
Look at ghetto’s public executions
Of us Black males and they binge watch
Treat a nigga like a wanted man
When they extend an olive branch
So they gotta put indebted in us
Only one of them is smoking contraband

[Hook x2]
They always to the right
And always in the wrong
And we ain't backing down because we knew it all along
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You take advantage of the briefest window
And now i paid allegiance to some evil sigil
Man the Christian Right they wanna strip my rights with some legal limbo, whoa!
Recontextualize a storm trooper
Nothing’s what your eating warm Gouda
On a squashed coin bustin cartwheels
Doing arms deals with a corn producer
Rockabilly so they call me leader
Wanting to ride a large weiner
Doing cellular talks while the deafest and the hawks
Weaponize all the card readers

[Interlude]
What the fuck?!
Stop us wanting
Legalese and a sloppy 'gina goes[?]
What the fuck?!
Your civil liberties die at birth, throw in the fireworks
What the fuck?!
Like a moth is an annoying cunt
Projections of employment bucks and baby bumps are fraudulent my negro
You trippin' (x6)
Yo Driver, you trippin’

[Hook]
They always to the right
And always in the wrong
And we ain't backing down cause we knew it all along
We knew it all along
We knew it, we was right (x2)

[Bridge]
Intersect
(When you intersect dangerous things can happen)

You got that perfect hair
You passed Eugen Fisher's tests
In a context where expansion theories and imbalanced technologies intersect
Where they intersect
Where they intersect
Where they, yeah

Presenting: “Equiano Ultra”
Oh shoot! Let's get em

[Outro]
King cookie-faced
Make crowns happen
Thumbs...
You don't(x3)
You don't know!
You don't know!

You got that perfect hair
