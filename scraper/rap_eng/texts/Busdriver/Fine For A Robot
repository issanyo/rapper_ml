She’s the skin stretched across the circuit board
I’ll put a fiery hoop on her mouse finger
We're supposed to adopt highways
But her mother’s milk's a soft drink
While her cigarettes smoke themselves
I end up with cancer of the everything
Her areola’s a satellite uplink
Storing mega-bytes of virtual fluff
Her phone has been fused to her face
She’s really health-conscious and pretentious
She’ll eat a flower’s root
Then file a counter-suit on a non-smoker
She knows a lot of a lot of little things

Oh yeah girl, put your hands on my keyboard
Yeah that's it
Yeah double click my mouse baby double click it
Oh yeah that's right
Click and drag baby, click and drag

I sit alone in the chatroom staring at the screen
Sipping Miller Lite and Grenadine
You’ve been programmed to kiss my earlobes and unbuckle my jeans while you play the greatest hits of The Eagles and Supremes
Shall we download a theme? (yeah)
I can be Larry Bird kicking it in Boston
I really like robot girls
Cause they're wicked awesome
And I wanna kick it wit you often
It's poppin'

This is the kiss of the floppy disk
I wish that I was prepared for this
I'm computer illiterate
She's got a manual to her sex-drive
She loves me vicariously
And I die in various manners and places
I wish that she loved me
She loves herself
Only
Her light bulbs need changing
