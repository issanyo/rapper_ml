[Intro: Sample, Busdriver]
Things
Why do, why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do you rush
Bang

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Tell my baby mama
I'm Salvador Dali Dalai Lama Ali Baba
Styling on the wah-wah
Wilding with his blah-blah
Sliding skulls of trauma
To the verse [?] to the genius of this raga
See I was at the gahba[?]
Tossing hot potatoes to the halos of OGs
Like a never ending saga
My niggeros[?] from Figaro made me feel like Rwanda
But I was pretty spooked when the suits gave me [?]
Like I was in the Weathermen, Neverland branch
Never understood the clever man that never can dance
But rap made thirty mil, we ain't thirsty still
Tell my baby mom I'm gonna dead it as a mercy kill

[Bridge: Sample]
Why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do, why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do you rush

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
Tell my baby mother
I think a lot to sink your shot at the buzzer
My hood's chief crop was rubber
While you sip hot tea
I'm at the top [?] refine the nut jumper[?]
My ball handling takes me from  suspect to target
My size alone says that I'm a roughneck at car theft
But look you can't dribble through the eye of a giant
Through the climate science without love

[Outro: Sample]
Why do you do these things
Why do, why do you do these things
Why do you do these things
Why do you rush
