[Verse 1]
By chance are you free
Here's my room key and splayed limbs
When I do me I play to win - Yeah (Promptly after we meet...)
You'll need to go drink absinthe
Under trees that grow leaves of absence (I left your ass alone)
While nursing hearts like leaking gaskets

[Hook]
This freedom it tastes funny
I am a case study
Dealing with utilitarian uses of love
To the ladies I'll be vague
Because I'm stretching my seed banks
Dipping my toe in the sleaziest cesspools above

[Verse 2]
My stage persona can be nude
Because the following day, it's renewed
And my subconscious is seafood - Yeah
When you invite me, I cross over
You'll smell burning and a waft sulfur
You've crashed along the soft shoulder

[Hook]

(We've got time)
(2x)

[Bridge]
Value sets and other moral imperatives
Don't have a place
And frankly we don't give a fuck about them
- You do - I don't
- You do - I don't
- Yes, you do - No, I don't
- You do - No, I don't
We don't give a fuck about them (3x)

(... of love)

[Verse 3]
The sex drive stupefies
Makes you feel like you're in Junior High
My impulses go unsupervised - Yeah
I prowl on foot and spin a yarn
When the crowd looks like wind farms
My defense mechanism's been disarmed

Yeah - This freedom it tastes funny
I am a case study
Dealing with utilitarian uses of love
(2x)

(Love)
