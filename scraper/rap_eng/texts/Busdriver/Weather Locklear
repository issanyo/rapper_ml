(This is the dream)

This is the dream of the hand-drum
You will be screened at random
So put up a European hand-gun
Shoot your way out your fish bowl
Okay

[Radioinactive]
This world's just a placebo
In my rusty gazebo
You can’t trust these duck seagulls
These are the mustiest people

(this is the dream)

[Radioinactive]
Sounds like you’ve got some problems
You need to smoke pot with goblins
There are some people who watch
And others who
Participate by watching
(yeah)

[Busdriver]
You say I’m dressed like a human cannon-ball
And I ask you how’s the food in Panama?
You won’t be able to order the pizza
Unless you renew your tourist visa

[Radioinactive]
Tell me why you wear a hip-brace
Why does your girl have her head shaved?
Was it a head on collision?
I know that's none of my business

(this is the dream)

Nasty waitress

(scatting)

Aw shit dun dunna dun dun
Fuck you
Asshole
You cunt suck
Do you speak-
¿hablas español?
Spanish?

Wait, come back one more time
Come on
