Me me me me me me me me me me me me me

[VERSE 1]
They paint their vulva beige
Bleed a cola keg
While I plan to ruin GOP motorcades
For these senseless zines turned censored scenes
I earn a soldier's wage

So I broke your legs
Threw you rollerblades
Because you claimed that the OG was overpaid
For pointing M-16s
At grenadine
Coursing through the pollster aids

I need my water brush
In the economic crunch
The financiers are seeped in embalming slush
And the sexist machines
Express the means
To re-appeal Roe vs Wade

So I gotta demode the dark matter
On the spring-loaded park plaza
Who is in charge?
I don't know
They all eat their business cards

I'm a hack at deer shooting
Know Vladimir Putin
While I wear this cashmere pantsuit thing
I can knight the spokesman
So Ibuprofen
Becomes your golden egg

[VERSE 2]
Automated voter readytellers are the subsequent heavy seller
In the pool of undecided registry
Because they don't give a fuck about the findings on a troop surge
It's a moot point
What have you heard?

Bumbling idiots for news correspondents see the desperate need to form a new foreign policy
Yet they give their credence to the pro-war pandering
As we all squabble over Saturn's rings

Regimented doubletalk undercuts the pertinence
Of our corporate heads trying to run away with tax cuts
In their vestables, the evangelicals are tent-poles
Begging the Head of State
"Deregulate the gross!"

Happy ever after
Benefactors all settle matters
The senate gathers to celebrate the fat fuck's
Inability to give a single solitary hoot
About the proletariat
Their merriment is gross

What does this mean for you though?

[VERSE 3]
You nigga's looking gee'd up
Rolling in a Prius
But I gotta give my money management a C+
With my foreclosed home
And pork bowl loans
I revisit the need to grind

I'm dating Russian fem-bots
Sipping on some hemlock
Cause I got overdue billing on my desktop
When I've been overthought and undercooked
That's when I need me time

[BREAK]
Me Time (repeat)

Well, I need some me time with the pulmonary palimpsest

Watch the banks merge, liberal thinker
Because now the middle finger is the California state bird
If you ain't heard
