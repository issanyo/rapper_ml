[Kendrick]
You will never ever catch me

[busdriver]
[?]not see the light in me and it's outlandish
They still want me to throw colors on this cloud canvas
I look inside my mind and find anxiety, no piety
I'm an OG and you have to trust me accordingly
My nigga Lotus told me I can't be caught
My homies winced when I dipped my toe in that free thought
But if you look inside my mind you'll find a gorgeous see
At Normandy
And these philosophical art opinions informing me
[?] so I rap in every place
Driver been on that sour [?] imagine every place
This country's been fucked since way back, I call it statutory rape
But show my consumer face
And they so uncivil with the little that we got
But let's go back and spit a little bit of pot
Roll [?] by a bigoted cop on the way to ramble riot every bit that's on the clock
Been on those sports to give them what we got
My heart's in the middle a rock
[?] derivative socks
So I'm picking the lock on summer homes
Political dissidents can't speak
But this is the fault of your antiques
My nigga you in the guest room might give them an ipad give them the [?]
And everything that we can need
My nigga, we the new breed
I know
That you want me to doubt the severity of it all
Fill up my bong
And shut the fuck up
Yeah, I should shut the fuck up
The politics of a butterball
Make my blood sugar [?]

You could never catch me be indebted, you so petty, shred the documents,[?] count yo pennies
