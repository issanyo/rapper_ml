Busdriver-

At the spot on weekdays, I shake hands with forks and knives
I’m stuck with side orders but I want that TimeWarner portion size
Y’all strolling to the top, my shit’s on warp drive
And that shit y’all on been dead nigga, Corpse Bride
Me, I’m pouring warm blood over a chilled glass of live rounds
Your city, my town, my trophy wife in a nightgown
At the meet and greet I belch a colorful modifier
I am the God of fire, pull a dreamhouse out of a wad of wire
I’m hustling, fool
With white men drinking White Russians
Light the pilot light of ovens because my shit’s got them hot and dry humping
I drink in the deal memo like it was Muscle Milk
My hustle puzzles and ruffles kilts
Watch out or…

Get cut on the serrated blade of a smile
We need financial aid this month
We gotta get major paid or get
Cut on the serrated blade of a smile
We don’t need wage slaves to chestbump
We gotta get major paid or get
Cut, Get cut

Man I peeped your shit that webcast was a stink bomb
I’m dead-assed when I said your career’s set path should be redrawn
Fool I can turn a head gash to a free song
By the end of the year I’m shopping at Bed Bath and Beyond
You stay a waterboy, we making a lotta noise
By acting cuckoo with fashion gurus and attention-seeking androgynoids
Our target audience lives on Youtube clips and candy bars
Wears snazzy garb and is acne-scarred
(My new new shit makes news crews trip)
But I’m mostly turned down
My lung pie is full of missed calls
My sunrise is comprised of well-lit stripmalls
I put corrupt docs in the glove box of chicks in suits
My thumb drive is dick and balls
I should be introduced as Price Paul
Back in my indie days I’d jerry-rig and circuit bend
My every gig was a perfect 10
And I’d seldom ask where and how
Now my icebreaker, it can make the heiress howl
Snagged on wet thighs I leave neckties and marriage vows
Watch out or…

Get cut on the serrated blade of smile
We need financial aid this month
We gotta get major paid or get
Cut on the serrated blade of a smile
We don’t need wage slaves to chestbump
We gotta get major paid or get
Cut, Get cut

We became what never was
We became what never was
