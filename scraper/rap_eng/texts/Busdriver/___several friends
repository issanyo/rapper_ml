[Verse 1]
And I got several friends
Within that digital hum
Then on the print of my thumb
I got several friends
Resembling identical twins
They study analytical trends
And the elliptical bend
How we get it in with chicken and wings
The original men
[?] issued a thousand lashes
[?] made of [?]
You may think it's outlandish
But it's how they brand us, how they do us
Subjugate your ambassador to mother nature
Through southern [?] fervor
[?]
What do your friends know
Do your friends know
I got several friends
And I don't trust any of them
So give me my general cleanse
It's all pencils and pens
Americans fetishize their own dances
Interrupted trans-continental bounce passes
[?] ounce of hash
Be aware the brainstorms landfall
And you mind shackles hacksaw
Has been reported from cerebral sources
[?]

[Hook]
Nigga, what type of friends do you got
Uh, what type of friends do you got

[Verse 2]
[?] warheads
While you doze to the loaf of the shortbread
This folk signals for the broke hymnals
To the crip walking in the [?]
Show us scores are dead
Forge your head
I repeat, scores are dead
Forge your head

[Hook]
What type of friends do you got
Uh, what type of friends do you got
What type of friends do you got
Uh, what type of friends do you got

[Verse 3]
I got several friends
And I don't trust any of them (Why?)
'Cause he's the chief administrator of that double-speak (Why?)
'Cause I've only known that nigga for about a couple of weeks (Why?)
'Cause I'm them other man's[?] revolutionary puzzle piece
And he can never recognize that
Looking at the climate science, it denies facts

[Outro]
I got several friends
