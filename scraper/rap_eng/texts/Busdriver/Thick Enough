Sunrise (x2)

[Verse 1]
She shows me her fake 'kini wax
Every time that she sees me rap
But she ain't thick, she ain't thick
She and her friends, they ain't thick
And always pays my tab at the bar
Drives me around in a Jaguar
But she ain't thick, she ain't thick
She and her friends, yeah they ain't thick, and now
You calling me your number one guy
You take down and do the butterfly
But you ain't thick, you ain't thick
You and your friends, y'all ain't thick
And I've been made the king of L.A
And you can be a queen for a day
But you ain't thick, you ain't thick
You ain't thick, you ain't thick

[Hook] (x2)
Nooo-oo-ooh
She ain't thick, she ain't thick, she ain't thick enough

[Verse 2]
Girl, you so Euro-trashy
Rocking your ? chassis
But, but, but, but
Your ways are turbo-tacky
Go get some rap rookie
To tap that flat tushy
Cause you, cause you, cause you ain't
Ain't got no fat nookie
Your boy gets that pushy?
It's like a black wookiee
?
Yeah, it gets that hoody
I don't smoke that Sticky Icky
But I can pick a thickie
Cause, cause, cause, cause, girl...

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 1 ]

Oh, you want some
Oh, you want some
Oh, you want some more, girl?
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

[Hook ]
