[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I took that hoe to the crib
She wanna know how we live
Just leave your shoes at the door
Imma get u in da zone (repeat)

[Verse 1 - Jeremiah Jae]

Waking up to a bad bitch
Dont get her upset then she a savage
I just want the cabbage
Pull up horse and carriage
Make you niggas embarrassed
Tell a hoe call her parents
I fathered niggas like parents
Bitch I'm out here in Paris
Making rounds like a ferris
We going back to the terrace
Jungle squad a new era
I told you niggas better keep up
I'm smoking loud you gotta speak up
I'm maxing out got my feet up
Ocean side on the beach front
Jungle squad I know you see us
I'm bout it bout it, I'm bout it bout it
I'm Master P, on the tour bus

Im In the zone, rolling smoking pour some more
Top floor, go and open up the door
Got the squad wit me and we got the codes
Shorty wanna know what she in for
Im In the zone, rolling smoking pour some more
Top floor, go and open up the door
Got the squad wit me and we got the codes
Shorty wanna know what she in for, so...

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I took that hoe to the crib
She wanna know how we live
Just leave your shoes at the door
Imma get u in da zone (repeat)

[Verse 2 - Busdriver}

They mistook all my game, for the word of god
I'm a place of worship
Mind is vibrant my eyelids are curtain rods
It's a place where the school of fish do not make super hits
But where a
Painter's canvas can
Anger manage speaking fluent French
I'm a hippie nigga who'd save the planet for a tuna fish
When I'm in the zone I can
Play the gambit for Buddha's kiss and serve a
Futurist
Plutonium in my gall bladder
I am marked for death
Having dinner with a dog catcher
No options left
They analyzing all the call data
Cuz my
Headspace cause a justifiable fed case
I spit the poem, split the bone
Comb the the naps with a fish bone
The psychological e-valuation can convict alone
So nigga get gone
When I cross the line they fully panic, they scared of my Woody
My hair is wooly I'm a wooly mammoth
The prehistoric ruler of the planet with my footing planted
On the ocean floor
Molten golden ore
Pouring open sore

We can't trust your game stats no
Wearing locs and wave caps
Ancient griot from way back
At the crib alone
Yea I'm in da zone (repeat)

[Chorus - Jeremiah Jae]

I took that hoe to the crib
She wanna know how we live
Just leave your shoes at the door
Imma get u in da zone (repeat)
