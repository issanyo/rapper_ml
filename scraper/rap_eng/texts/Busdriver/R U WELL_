[Intro: Busdriver]
You asked me if I was doing well
Well uh, imma be honest

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
I am not a south by south-west, I am behind you
Reaching for the back of the shadow
For the source to the darkness
From the pit to the black
From the richness in the sack
I am not [?]
There is a battered curtain between me and certain death
I am here all week
Where my mother left me with guns to muck
Where rolls of [?] from the living room just like small talk
No I'm not at the, Michael brown vigil
I'm at the scene of a fresh new shooting
Where the smartphones were off
And the units speak in [?] spells
Flashes of red light, lighting the body
Nothing said, no strings or bounds
No preach [?] ideas in reach
[?] is in reach
No preach [?] ideas in reach
(No preach [?] ideas in reach)
Something like that, come on

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
Are you well? Are you well?
You dress like you just got a Kanye co-sign, oh is it true?
Has your life changed? Is it true?
Has it changed to the aluminum dome mind
To the Olympic poolside, [?] arena
Realtime advertise, giving hand jobs to TMZ Hyenas
Responding to humanitarian crisis via emoji swarms
And folded arms of defense
Fate have given the blank ?[] to a wide reciever
While [?] inbetween em
Light was buying for the other world
That the hunger with fund raiser
Till I got hit, in the favorite form
With these stun gun phasers
Are you well?
You don't look the same, you don't look the same
Paralyzed from the hip down
Staralyzed at the get down
Me and you lets have a sit down
[?] homies always getting
And your ladies getting dicked down
So now you couldn't kidnap sixth round
Nah, nah, [?]

[Verse 3: Busdriver]
Lying sick to my stomach
[?] feel low, i got evicted from the slums pit
Im turning colors when i meet strangers
Half machine half mistake, I'm almost [?]
[?] it's update
I'm garunteed to take fakers on [?] fake
I'm just a slip cause im out my mind
Batteries on my tounge, it's alcaline browse a line
You can not find a style like mine in crowded lines
[?] a specific type of blackout
Hack account of hedge fund, manager to bill
Fuckers in Canada, no im not doing well
Who the fuck are you to tell, my story? yes
It's monkey see, monkey do
My whole crew is honey bees in running shoes
And we was broke this whole time the, moneys new
Sweet drops of honey dew, all your ladies coochy coo
I'm the OG that they raped a story book about
Crooked trial on gold grills baby know im soo ill
I'm the OG that they raped a story book about
Crooked trial on gold grills baby know im soo ill
