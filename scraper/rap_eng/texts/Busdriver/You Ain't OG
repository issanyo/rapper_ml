Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Hook:]
Oh, you ain't OG!
'cause real OGs remember everything
That took place

At the date in question you vanished
Into thin air
From the day we knew we couldn't
Put our hearts in your care
Your care
So how dare, how dare, how dare
You show your face around!

[Hook:]
Oh, you ain't OG!
'cause real OGs remember everything
That took place

Take what maternity fools you
But do not think of the served men lay boring before you
At the launch parties you pulled the chord's scoops
But do not cite sources or perform under love the ocean

But I was there
Yeah, I was there
I was there
I was there

[Hook:]
Oh, you ain't OG!
'cause real OGs remember everything
That took place

What you've said could fall [?] to be true
So why you think your argument would be something we would avoid through
You know I'd never, ooh, lie to you
So why would you claim the world we already gave life to
