Versace Versace, I'm down in the lobby like Salvador Dali
Twisting my stache and I'm getting that cash
And I'm sipping on coffee
Why your girl text, saying I'm sexy
What's her name Holly
I am in love ho, so fuck no
You can not suck on my lolli
I am not writing frivolity, nigga I'm issuing policy
They only play this in Martian colonies for the recluses and oddities
Who can chew bullets like poppy seeds
Along with the league of the chalky knees
Our relationships are putting major chips
In the paper clips of prohibited economies
But to be honest my nigga, no I can't afford no Versace
I shiver on trollies and go home to table full of glossies
But when I put on these shade you can not take them of me
Like I took Biggie's eye exam
Like I'm eating 50 fried clam
Versace Versace, vindicated vaginas on vivacious Vivians
Moriarty's magna cum laude bumping loudly as rowdy amphibians
The talking points are spoken loudy, the oilmen are Saudi
And nigga, that's really in
But with me, when it's love or money
You can always bet that the titties win
Versace Versace, I'm sipping on lasse, my time is so costly
Cuz my wage is a pittance my days are sentence
And I am no Chachi
I harbor a pathogen that there hasn't been antibodies
For, I'm an author
Writing batty copy
Whores, engorged
Riding candy bodies
Tour the shores
From Miami to Mugabe
Hoards roar...
,
For cannopy of the bugatti, manatee poonany
Dancing fancy-free to Fugazi
While fans on Hannity who shot me
Can plead to manic fossil fuel lobbies
Can it be

I'm dead again for that Versace
