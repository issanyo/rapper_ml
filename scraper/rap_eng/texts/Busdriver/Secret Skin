This self-made mogul alpha-male
Now seeks a Dalai Lama
To become a cocooned darling larva
I'll donate my album sales
To what the left-wing stance is
The pet peeves of the candidates
And wet reeds in their tan lips
Exceeds the bandwidth
The self-empowered blogsters, and all you apathetic scenesters
From this downward-dogger
Newly flowered songbird
But I used to drive my stretch Humvee
Through rap fads like an occupied Baghdad
Looking like a pet monkey
In a one-piece holding a handbag
Now I'm stylized in your art commune
Torturing a TV host
Holding a weenie-roast over car-bombed ruins
Choking on a tapioca ball
In being a sun-drenched life-size Yoda doll
Obsequious banter is protocol (new skin)
Admonished, I withstand the office day singed
Then become counter-culture's misanthropic statesman
Take wives with a chest full of animal hair
Put their vulvas on pre-heat
Then have an extra-marital affair at the yoga retreat
I'm a wheatgrass fueled, rehashed, eco-friendly hippie freak
Encased in what's aesthetically pleasing
Marvel at this LA-based, dead artifice

We are all coated in a plastic film
But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin
There lies a layer of secret skin
Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants
There lies a thick layer of secret skin
A body for you to re-begin

'Please give to this undisclosed relief fund'
Says the liberal with a tealeaf on his tongue
Cuz soldiers are pointing their BB guns at children's TB lungs
So we've sanctioned graffiti fun to slander your figurehead
Hack into amalgamated algorithms that open cells in crowded prisons
But I got to get that 'save-the-world-look' first
Under that thin veneer, there is a buried sun
An aptly engineered new planetarium

Working class
Heroism
Is stylish
All season

Sleeveless shirts
Quinoa
Drum circles
Palm-reading

We are all coated in a plastic film
But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin
There lies a layer of secret skin
Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants
There lies a thick layer of secret skin
A body for you to re-begin
We are all coated in a plastic film
But there lies a thicker layer of secret skin
There lies a layer of secret skin
Under your soft-edit enhanced cosmetic implants
There lies a thick layer of secret skin
A body for you to re-begin
