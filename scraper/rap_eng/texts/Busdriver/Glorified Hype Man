Glorified Hype Man

Broadcast - (Busdriver)
It has been announced earlier this evening
That America’s favorite boy band
The Weather
Has disband
Each member refusing to speak to each other
Or the press

Why did you break up? (friction)
Well, we broke up because there were uh
Inter-group pressures
And it was an experiment to begin with
(Last time)
Sounds like garbage to me

(Busdriver)
I don’t want to be in this group
I want to
Pursue my solo career
Do coke and do beer
I’ll be broke in a year
And move into my stepparent’s guesthouse
But my mama rants
She wants me to move out
I said
"not a chance"
And she drowned my pet mouse
In my lava lamp
I’m a reluctant star
I play g-funk in my car
And my image consultant
Has me wearing an expensive chain with a wife-beater
I’m in to petty thieving
You eat veggie-vegan and look like a sixties civil rights leader
I need new management

(the world
I'm turning
I'm floating and free
Sweet
I'm lifting
As smooth as can be)

(Busdriver)
Anything you can do
I can do better
I can do anything better than you

(Radioinactive)
Precisely
When he poisoned Radioinactive (the famous double?)
With a glass of Saccharin
And threw a dispenser of napkins
At Busdriver
Over an argument
Over affirmative action
That's when we knew
That he (after this commercial break)
Had fallen
Over
The edge

Friction, friction, friction always causes heat (X 4)

Rapper slain
On the corner of Wilshire
While on the set of the Spielberg film
'Cocoon-Grin'
Former band-mate was sought for questioning
When found wandering Santa Monica
Wearing a headdress
Asking bystanders
What year it was
Needless to say
His testimony was discredited

Reaction - Rhetteric (As The Concerned Homie)
Hey dog, no esé
Man, nah
That's not how he died esé
I learned yo
I was watching
America's Most Wanted, holmes
I was sitting right there with my heina dog
I swear to god esé
John Walsh was talking about it dog
He was in the reserves dog
He was a man, dog
He died for you esé!

(Radioinactive)
He was like a brother to me
And the dopest rapper ever
To step up to the mic
He wanted to fight
In the Gulf War
He was a reserve
In the Coast Guard
Got sent to Iraq
And sent us postcards
With rhymes on the back
His moms told us
It was friendly fire
On a routine maneuver
Got run over by a tank tire
Just behind
Enemy lines
We weren’t gonna
Pretend to be fine
We cried on the record
When we did his rhymes
Got tattoos of his line
"blowing up like landmines
Cause my ish is da bomb"
R.I.P
MC Top Ram

(Busdriver)
Anything you can do
I can do better
I can do anything better than you

(Busdriver)
We broke up because I beat up and offend
Promoters and club owners
And now they’re screening their relatives for blood donors
My love folder's full of wide-rule sheets
Me
Tribe Unique
And OMD paint sky-blue streaks
On the face of mountains
But I do stink
So you will boo

(Radioinactive)
After catching Busdriver
With my baby cousin in the blue Chrysler
I stabbed him in the stomach with a rusty screwdriver
I tried to get him a tutor cause he never even learned how to read
He would fake an asthma attack before every show
And if he never comes back from the Netherlands
That would explain the snowchains on the tattoo of the school bus on his face
I heard it was because he got locked up for selling cocaine on the school bus as a kid

Broadcast - (Busdriver)
A reunion tour is scheduled for the following summer

(Radioinactive)
He chose skiing over rapping?
Ugh
What a disgrace
