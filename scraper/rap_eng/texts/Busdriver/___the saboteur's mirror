[Intro]
We poisoned the paint
Filled in a noise complaint

[Verse 1]
I'm solving problems with music
I'm using my scepter that evolved from a pool stick
Cruise ship, I'm full of either Somalian pirates
Or jazz men practitioners yankin' out flag pens
You cannot solve your problems with music
I'm banned from the sausage fest when I colored in the water crest
Radicalized by a false arrest just like my world viewâ€™s an oxygen tank, caught in a  fence with them holes in it
How can you reference the world but never roll in it
Master P money from grown [?] with No Limits
Who go the distance into money making ventures
And show the resistance my photo is physics
Frozen in mid-flight new signs for the bit pipe
Become the mixmaster for the mixed martial arts of the shaman
Pediatrics for the queens of tomorrow
The lifestyle [?] and dreams you can borrow

[Chorus]
Like this is not a place you can chill
Is the face of a mountain the face of a bill
The saboteur's mirror
Streaming truth as you're chased down a hill
This is your heart in a bag
Where you cannot depart from the fad or your art in an ad
The saboteur's mirror
Does a soup with your arsenic tabs

[Verse 2]
Sneaking in [?]
Everywhere the games of the broke economy
Nobody can follow the thread of logic or the blockage
Of metabolic or weed trippin'[?]
Is this a [?] regiftin'
Yo, the fuck
They must have mistaken that love for a human feeling
Blew the tuba through the roof and the ceiling like

[Break]
They don't know about that
They don't know

[Verse 3]
They find the character of your heart
Adequate for a black nationalist upstart
Pluck apart that woven fear
You're super [?] in the lower tear
Where you can read all your emotions clear
Now you know you a [?] rack up that karmic debt [?] you over grip
Don't stop to behold the myth
Fuck an artist's rep

[Interlude]
Happy birthday to me
Sometimes you just can't fall in place
You can't
Watcha gonna do with that beat

[Chorus 2]
Can I fall into place
You cannot fall into place
You cannot fall into place

[Verse 4]
You can solve any of your problems with music
Self right on they dime[?]
Hip hoppers climb to the top of the pinnacle of the pop charts
Distinctive kinds of black art have put the black artists on the meat mart
The industry hack whose teeth are sharp
Everybody needs to meet this side of the park
I try to reconvene, you see what I mean
[?]
That seems to be the best point of emphasis
You know we be eating with the photosynthesis
And I wonder whether homies would hold up on the written test
You know that's why I be spitter
I should have had you rappers on a grill like a chicken breast
Bad rep, really, snap necks on my aspects really
'Cause y'all ain't down with the Aztecs really
My vernacular says African Mexican
While the fashion of the denizen
Stays masculine and feminine
I'm a missing in action veteran (What?)
[?]
While your hood is a maximum bedlam [?]
Turned it out it was an act of God, but yeah which one
Yes, you, why you act so odd
You kick up with the homies that kiss guns
[?] touching that playful stubble
Angel dust on that cake crumble
So you board the space shuttle
'Cause they don't know that you make trouble

[Chorus 2]
I fall into place
You cannot fall into place
You cannot fall into place

[Outro]
You can solve any of your problems with music, music
You can solve any of your problems with music, music
They don't know about that
They don't know
