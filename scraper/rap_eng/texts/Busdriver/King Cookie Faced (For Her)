Intro:
(I told her I'd step outside of myself for her.)
Driver. You got that---
(You're much better when you're high.)
Uh, nap in a serpent's lair
You got that perfect hair..from a German heir
(She thought I was better when I was less me.)

Chorus thing:
It's her! You know her

Verse 1:
This is when she'll think I'm at my very best
This is when she'll rub up on my hairy chest
She'll think that I'm better than I really am
I go really ham, swing off the ceiling fan
Pundits say I'm partisan when I'm indifferent
Cuties think they fine china when they chipped dishes
The border agents think I'm shady when I'm cranky tho
Exes think I'm dating hoes I'm buying baby clothes
My lady got me gone off that cup of tea
And now them silly pawns they don't govern me
Now---
(my lady got me gone)
Damn

Chorus:
It's her! You know her
She's mine

Verse 2:
School tuition costs about a bus token
The rap game is permanently stuck open
I will spend most of my time insulting people
I will claim that all of us are multilingual
Man I can figure skate on black ice
Up on the interstate I jack knife
I don't think that I can lift a metric ton
But I think that I'll run into the setting sun
I get to be the nigga for a nano-sec

Yeah. I can do the right thing the wrong way
I can peel all the stressors from a long day

Bridge:
She loves me like she means it (4x)
Don't cheat

Chorus:
It's her! That's my girl!

Verse 3:
My cd thinks I'm picky when I'm spot on
I get credit for songs I'm not on
The beauty standards don't start at hot blondes
There is no way I am not on
My decision making is compromised
I can paint the autumn skies canvas wallet size
Hellfyre Club is my goto
You like me cause there's nothing that I won't do

Outro:
King cookie face. Can you tell it's me?
Can you tell it's me?
When I'm king cookie faced...can you tell it's me?
Hellfyre Club...can you tell it's me?
