[Verse 1]
Black man is a colloquial term
I’m in that voting booth soaked in the Oreo germ, I’m
Called to renounce my poetry publically
From the stapled stomach of an unfaithful lummox
Now I rap for bankers, that’s why I’m exacting bangers
My new flaccid wang is always casting flavor
Is always dipped in frosting
I died prematurely before I got to equip my offspring
Beware of the swamp thing
Look at my eyes and really know that there are no answers
So go ahead and mix that coca with the Arm & Hammer
The knowledge of self was all it took to arm the Panthers
They gave the same thing to me and I got a charming stammer
That’s them dark thoughts shooting through the enamel
Tuning the piano, looking at you like “What meds?”
When parts of who you are often butt heads
You can’t build a cut thread without bloodshed
You can’t relate to your child cause your mind is adrift
How many times could you hide your lies in a gift?
You know cowardice, you feel the power shift
As your mind shatters your ego to a thousand bits

[Interlude]
Ah
Yeah
Ah
Yeah
Hear me out
One time
It’s like this
Ah

[Chorus]
The old saying goes, “an eye for an eye”
But it plays out like “the lead for the feed”
The cookie face king chief's ‘nna bleed
In the stadium and it’s me vs. me
The old saying goes, “an eye for an eye”
But it plays out like “the lead for the feed”
The weapons system’s always eager to please
Get me

[Verse 2]
Americanism as a serial murder
No empirical data just a theoretical merger
Between the giants of science and financial mechanisms
Admit guilt to get milked with all the sentenced women
Outside the fire-breathing Orwellian dynamo
And spitting out designer clothes for quaint trusims and hind rhyming flows
I don’t have or wear a dress on, vagina role
But I can spit a verse for the Bible tho like “hi, bye bye bo”
It’s me vs. me
That’s right, it’s all me
Ch’eah!

[Chorus]
The old saying goes, “an eye for an eye”
But it plays out like “the lead for the feed”
The cookie face king chief’s ‘nna bleed
In the stadium and it’s me vs. me
The old saying goes, “an eye for an eye”
But it plays out like “the lead for the feed”
The cookie face king chief’s ‘nna bleed
In the stadium and it’s me vs. me

[Verse 3]
Your personality is torn from your face
For a power-hungry junky who was born on the base
Getting sworn into office to stand up to the scorn of our caucus
And distort the importance of a race
Plead on my knees to the Julius Caesar
For the begging for reprieve from my Sudanese kibutz
It’s the water got lead in it, the children they be breathing soot
The Founding Fathers, they’re the esteemed thieves and crooks
