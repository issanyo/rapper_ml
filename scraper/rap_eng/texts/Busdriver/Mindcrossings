[Verse 1]
Come to LA where the smog sings
[?] lattes
It's all dreams
And I'm in love with a talking hot air balloon
She gets drunk at the hair saloon
She has the biggest breasts and the shortest ad space
And there's a nigga dressed all in blackface
And that's why I'll be carjacked by a Korean volleyball team
[?] that's why my body all green
[Didn't pay you] to cross my mind my body's green grass
And my eyes are now a gaping wound
And they want to clean my gash
'Cos I'm being extremely rash
While chasing the moon
[?] thinker's wisdom
My body's implanted with a sprinkler system
And if that wasn't a drawback
They told me to fill out this draw back
Just in case it rains dogs and cats

[Hook x2]
When you cross my mind you best look both ways
'Cos my personality's bigger than yours

[Verse 2]
When you cross my mind you're best to look both ways
Walk the streets in an insulated space suit
Innovative breaks and loops
Give the bass their escape routes
If they're not intimidated and break loose
And the stimulants are grapefruits
You see daddy cares what we form in all the wreckage
What anti-glare now I know how awful that [?]
This is my thoughtful message written in scribble
Only to be transcribed by the last man alive
Who lives in LA and was just having sex with an insecure dancer
Until he has testicular cancer and dies
But me, I sit on my lawn chair
Waiting for my tax return
Swinging my long hair, riding on a pachyderm
In an [Aeroshrift] store
'Til we hit aisle two [..] [as ashes and urn]
In LA I'm dead, a cold snap that won't pick up on the heat sensor
I'm like your own dad
With false teeth and dentures
Selling biodegradable lawn to inflatable dolls
This is where the beat drops
And you put your hands in the air
Don't just stand there like [three] bewildered panda bears
Show some enthusiasm
Hopefully when the show's done I'll leave with a moody [mandle?] who has a booty you can't fathom
[?] and too scoops so wash it down with fruit juice
Sorry, some times things cross my mind before I cross theirs
My thoughts are in their crosshairs

[Hook x2]
When you cross my mind you best look both ways
'Cos my personality's bigger than yours
