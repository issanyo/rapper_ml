Black power obstructionist, take down this phone number
Black power obstructionist, please take down this phone number. Thank you, yes

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
Solipsistic world builder, I cry out for the medic bay
Before the burning hickory, murder mysteries on my father's resume
Post rated anarchy make grace defeated at the rate or speed of blowing dust on the kitchen counter but don't worry I'm an average joe
Nose up I'm sniffing flowers
My bone crushed from hidden powers
Stored in my fat tissues, I'm in the hood eating sugar cane
This
Is a current not back issue
I'm reconfigured, do I look the same?
I am the extracted data from a mind probe, homie cook me to flame
But sir

It's not my fault

[Verse 2: Milo]
I assure you
I will not kill the thieves in my garden
I'm reading carvings from the well bottom
How many darkies were killed this autumn ?
How can I exploit my race card with activia?
How can black people be collapsed into bits of trivia?
I am not a hashtag or a citizen of Libya
So I don't exist
[?] postmodernist conscript of no particular consequence
Which is why my soul and all its potentials are worth less than a bag of Skittles
Classic riddle
Who am I?
Black power obstructionist, acknowledge me
Black power obstructionist, take down this number
Black power obstructionist, acknowledge me
Black power obstructionist, take down this number

[Busdriver]
It's not my fault
