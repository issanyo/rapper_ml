[Verse 1] [Onry Ozzborn]

I've got that elder wand and it responds to what I think and what I say
And whether or not it's dangerous has no influence on this day (hey)
Make no mistake you are awake, lively than ever blake
You've been having the shakes ever since your first and taken ET cupcake (great)
We survived the plague on a day-to-day basis patients have tasted a lot on this daycare
Ancient makeshift face-lift relationship
For a second he wait 'til they walk away with the tail on "wag"
It's ok, touch√©, been knowing that all along toe tag (sup)
We're the best we ever had, gonna have, tell the friend to telephone, better grab
On the rust forever, tell the phone back, teleprompter, tell'em to grab telepath
Tell your mom to tell your dad we had a laugh at your expense the expensive rap fans
No brainer off the top pro lad try sample sniffing that nose splash
Brass monkey, jump, let yourself go, insomniac I don't need blow
I'll pass you like we all can't throw, head off eight wanting Karen O
We let it molt, walking offering a sacrifice
The imprint on your life protect, do as a fame and Friday night

[Hook]
Look at what the cat drugged in (x3)
He has your tongue


[Verse 2][Busdriver]
Damn, shining that halogen light show, ice skin, tight clothes, play that mistro
As I begin that dice throw what nice hoes are been for a price fold
Galaxies explode I dare you to rise allude your thigh
And confidently call you "pooter pie" I easily undo your sky
Read you your Miranda rights, your mine now, girl fuck your friends
And you ain't camera shy, you're Miranda July make love to the lens
Call you my coloured girl, even though you're German, Irish
Gazing at your perfect iris, ice pearl with huge eyes went
Do hear that stare? That's the exact sound of a heart breaking
I'm heart quaking, my love making, if you start rating, but I'm a large baby
You think I'm a Princeton man, your vision's been Instagramed
I've caressed you like it's lift a gram, so it's a lie like I'm on this witness stand
I've never walked around my city with pinched nards,my heart's been enlarged if you scour my SIM card
For a trace of a freak, a case of the deep, I'm brought her home with shin guards
Blaming all of my hoes when they know that I was in charge


[Hook]
He has your tongue

(Maybe the worst mistake you've ever made in your whole life
Going once, going twice we'll never happen)
[Verse 3][Onry]
Auction off, no we won't slow it
Passion allowed the pass out, crash out, stay the night, mash mouth
Cash cow, 20 questions written on your glass house with lipstick
You dipshit, neat I'll be specific, I'm linguistic punken misfit
Mixed with birth and death certificates
