[Chorus]
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us

[Verse 1]
Woah, hopped out the couch
Walked out the house, turned around and it's exploding slowly
Outside didn't move[?]
What's it all about really, nigga you supposed to know me
When we reaching in there, smoking stogies
And listening to golden oldies
You must have misinterpret
That old Leimert shit
When I really[?] started smoking OGs
You acting out the legend of the [?]
But you've [?] killed what it used to be
Don't ya see
All of us are balling at the juicery
Building our immunity
Smoking in the kitchen
[?] focus on our women
When they ask about the shooting yet they holding an opinion
[?] you're folding all your linens
And you got a place to stay because they opened a new prison
Yankees say they opened a new prison
For fools like you because you're going independent
Thinking flow is infinite
Yet you[?] [?] in the Kremlin[??]
Got a rap sheet enclosed in your pigment
Oh yeah, they opened a new prison

[Chorus]
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us

[Verse 2]
Gangster
He's a gangster
Fear is currency and death is a business
He's gonna die in a turf war
Not on a surf board [?]
Acting out the legend of the [?]
Smoking shit, opiates
Split your mind in two layers
Surrender your homies to the nether world
All of your love contained in a ghetto girl
Memorize the young shooter's syllabus and fill the clip
Light them niggas up like some filaments
The realest shit
Then we headed off to the dealership
The wilderness [?] that's the diligence
[?]
You got that PTSD, always extra testy and
Eager to go berserk
Who was trained for [?]
[?] turning girls veins into fire engines
It's a classic case
Why am I pretending
I met a real person
You win my heart

[Chorus]
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us
We've never seen such strength
Awaken, speak to us
