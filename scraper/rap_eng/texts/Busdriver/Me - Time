(with The Pulmonary Palimpsest)
-(they paint their vulva) beige, bleed a cola keg, while i plan to ruin GOP motor cades
Part these senseless zines, turned censored scenes, i earn a soldiers wage
So i broke your legs, threw your roller blades, cuz you claimed that the OG was overpaid
For pointin' M-16's at grenadines, coursing thru the pollster aid
I need my water brush, in the economic crunch, the financers are seeped in embalming slush
On the sexist machine, express the means to re-appeal Roe vs Wade
So i gotta de mode, the dark matter, on the spring loaded park plaza
Who is in charge, I don't know, they all eat their business cards
-(I'm a hack at deer) shootin' know Vladimir Putin
While i wear this cashmere pant suit thing
I can knight the spokesman, so Ibuprophen, becomes your golden egg
(automated) voter readytellers are the subsequent heavy seller, in the pool of undecided registry
-cuz they don't give a f*ck about the findings on a troop surge, it's a moot point what have you heard
(bumbling) idiots for news correspondents see the desperate need for a new foreign policy
-yet they give credence to the pig war pandering, as we all squabble for Saturn's rings
(regimented) double talk under cuts the pertinence of (corporate) heads tryin' to runaway with tax cuts
-(investi)bles the evangelicals are tent poles beggin' the head of state de regulate the gross
(happy ever)after benefactors all settle matters, (the senate)gatters to celebrate the fat f*cks
-(inabili)ty to give a single solitary hoot about the (prola)teriate their merriment is gross
-(your niggas looking) gid up, rolling in a Prius, (but i gotta) give my money management a C plus
With my foreclosed home, an' pork bowl loans, i revisit the need to grind
-(i'm dating Russian) fem-bots, sipping on hem lock (cuz i got) overdue billings on my desktop
-(when i've been) overthought an' undercooked, that' s when i need me time
-watch the bank merge liberal thinker cuz now the middle fingers the California stat bird
