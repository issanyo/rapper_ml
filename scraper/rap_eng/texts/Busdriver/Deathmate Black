[Verse 1]
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
It’s in the sky in chemtrails from a Dorner drone
There’s a war between fezes and Jesus
The winner ghost-wrote the pledge of allegiance
Niggas afraid to touch mason jars
There’s worse shit on your identification card
For any man to ever say another man is irrelevant
Is an ant trying to grow a trunk and dance like an elephant
So Mister Frankenstein, dead your experiment
Body so African and head so American
And here’s the deed to the motherfuckin’ promise land
A pound of weed and the printed lyrics to rocket man

[Pre-Hook]
One whole shattered into dividends
They’re connected by the rhythm and blood
Two extremes of faithful and paranoid
But neither ever really saw what it was
Every step a man has even taken
Was only past playing in another man’s original dream
And you keep seeing yesterday ‘cause its all gonna happen again

[Verse 2]
Brand new once again, one year later (its all gonna happen again)
Like never before, all over again, one year after (it’s all gonna happen again)
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Written in the sky with chemtrails from a Dorner drone
And they afraid to touch mason jars
When there’s far worse shit on your identification card

[Hook]
I couldn't change your life but I wanted to
I wanted you to hear nothing else after this
The ego is the dirtiest of private parts
A spirit boner never sittin' less than six feet high
I want this shit to do what it doesn’t do
Disregard other people’s choices like they ain’t that cool
As if this cab was a thing to be bragged about
When don’t nobody sitting in it seem to know what to do
Except write these words
And record these words
Memorize these words
‘Til they get on our nerves
And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve
Cause the money and the karma is imaginary
You don’t believe in your arteries and capillaries
But they still work
Nobody asked you to
Nobody ever not once ever asked you to
And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit

[Pre-Hook]
One whole shattered into dividends
They’re connected by the rhythm and blood
Two extremes of faithful and paranoid
But neither ever really saw what it was
Every step a man has ever taken
Was only past playing in another man’s original dream
And you keep seeing yesterday ‘cause its all gonna happen again

[Bridge]
Everyone's overreacting
(It’s all gonna happen again)
Everyone's overreacting
(It’s all gonna happen again)
Everybody's now under arrest
Even the cops, army, and kids

[Hook]
I couldn't change your life but I wanted to
I wanted you to hear nothing else after this
The ego is the dirtiest of private parts
A spirit boner never sittin' less than six feet high
I want this shit to do what it doesn’t do
Disregard other people’s choices like they ain’t that cool
As if this cab was a thing to be bragged about
When don’t nobody sitting in it seem to know what to do
Except write these words
And record these words
Memorize these words
‘Til they get on our nerves
And we learn to never wait for what we think we deserve
Cause the money and the karma is imaginary
You don’t believe in your arteries and capillaries
But they still work
Nobody asked you to
Nobody ever not once ever asked you to
And they wouldn't till they found a way to benefit
