Me and you in love with our
Rule over solid waste
Our artistic merit is questionable
We'll fall on our face
And I can't bare the sight
Not to sound pragmatic
But our parents were right
This ain't adequate
But you can always seek refuge under…

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Return to the bourgeoisie while I sift through debris

You view the poverty line as a threshold
For truth in pricey slums
This ain't art school, it's a shark pool
Of well-groomed yuppie scum
And they got orders to kill
Watch them fashion your cell
How'd they get a recording deal
When they're wack as hell
But the chicken-scratch in your sketch book
It mirrors what you loath

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers

They got easels to stain, and uh
People to blame, with their
Egos inflamed, and their
Neat codenames
I saw your sub-genre in a passing glance
It was you and your DJ in matching pants

Sleeping pills and record sleeves
Defaced museum pieces
Concert-goers flailing arms
Taxidermy for the nouveau riche

I don't need this
I don't need this…

Sunshowers
There's a place for you, not no place for me under…
Sunshowers
Sunshowers
I don't need this, I don't need this
