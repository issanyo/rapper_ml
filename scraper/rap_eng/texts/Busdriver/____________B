[Track 1: Tobacco Chewer]
Welcome one and all to the circus de la Kow
In these mean nine walls am I lettin' out forever
Baby girl, bring the cheddar, this admission love's too bright
See this ticket holds me better than a couple crowds a night
So how 'bout it I call on the spoon washing
Daddy's-a-seein' to get rowdy
Throw me some books on that party
[Howdy ?] my cardy
Grab [the ?] [impressure ?] pan
These blue shows are are the breakfast 'cause it's too soon for my crash
And it's moo moo to my death bed
But who knows if I shall last?
Huh damn, can I really admit it?
Took a few pills out but baby I quit it
Y'all be so cringey but lady who isn't
My navy is tinted with mucus and midgets
So run up on the squad if you wish
For your body to reform to the hat upon my dish
This is highly consternin' without the ruckus from my kids
Drop the buckets full of chicken steady cluckin' at my bins
It is me throwin' spoons upon an ocean full of lies
Hey I'm tabbed out [saint ?] General the Yotesquadron
[My?] boy

(Oh)
(Yeah)
(Oh)
(Yeah)
(Oh yeah)

Stepped in the pack I believe it's here
Cook a few [pens ?] and ten bottles of snow
Boil the bodies then cook 'em in hell
I promise you fellas, you're to prevail
(Oh, now let it breathe, let us set in, my [?])
Barge these streets with the fleet for protection
And I hope you finny fuck boy won't reject it
See I start, pay a visit, drove a camel for a stack
I could give a care less for the army that you get
See alarm these city gods that pull the cannons up and shit
You can try to cause a ruckus and can promise me revenge
Boy
(This is my squad, these are my thoughts)

[Track 2: Paisleysmoke]
[Verse 1]
(La la la la la la)
(Shyeah, boy)
(Shyeah, see it is I, huh)
(Boy)
See Yote don't wear proper pairs of pants
And Yote don't know whether not his doctor is a man
But Yote rather not 'n settle focus to the jam
'Cause Yote makes it hot with all the chokes and fryin' pans (Shyeah)
Now boy you see it's muffins and cash
A couple cantaloupes and melons help me straight my path
A couple fellows keep me goin' rather worth it if all
The notes posted on the board was notin' similar acts
But besides that willy we shall voyage other lands
You can journey silky meadows and the doom's a burning sand
You can follow my commands
See there's room for many lads
And we colour different sides so we diversitize the hands
([?] up for the task I got goods of many flavors [?] ruckus 'n all that)
And boy I never [bit you ?] that cold
See it's nothin' when there's not a little crew gettin' bold

[Verse 2]
And on these seven seas you see I ain't gotta stand
It's how you see how many beings think I'm crazy in the head
Lazy in the bed I'm often hazy when I shed
A couple layers of the steam without a single trace of wind
(Seep through the fears of [little ?] puppetician friends)
([Lyin' steam ?] a quick display of writin' super saiyan blends, [?])
But these underrated trends dismiss
These lone peasants headed soon for these strange prisons

[Verse 3]
(Shyeah)
(Shyeah)
(Haha haha ha)
See we gon' makin' eyes move baby
Beholdin' you [?] turn on you, baby
Can tell them 'tudes with how I choose to pull the loose, ain't it?
But it's all good 'cause I love all and every shoe shaded
But don't you test it my presence is rather heavy as
A couple peasants indebted with dirty shades of
Home investment
I promise the [?] set I had
A couple [commas/commers ?] in buckets full of these kettle crabs
(Huh, shyeah)

[Verse 4]
And whether not you choose who to move with
Yote got a spot bring me lead if you prove it
That's a couple open tabs in my cellar
But if [?] load it up with cotton [so ?] they let them
Get up out of my sight, see my boy shouting rowdy
And my [?] might
And the bugs out crawlin' through the floor and good night
We don't play no boy
Ain't no games in my line
Never wastin' no time with it

Shhyeah, yotesquad

[Track 3: FACTCHECKER]
[Verse 1]
Quick escape to find me bathing in a lake
Made of cocoa beans and butter that do [floor or ?] show my face
Born, born pretty as the paintings that I make
And I'm sweet as sour grapes so get them bags of lemonade
Pass the seven trays and smash them shits across the brain
And show these pussies how we ruckus, threw the rubbish with the flames
Damn, we dumb as fuck and stickin' pencils up their nasals
Just to find the hidden gold and which my Daddy showed me frames of
He told me "Dang son, don't get carried away son."
But Mommy told me "Honey, if you think it then go chase 'em"
Now dreams of eating cake with dirty ladies seem a real sense
I chose to spoon desert on little sister just to make fun
And now I run the candy kingdom
Put Ralphie in the corner while Venelope gives me some
Feathers for the chilling and the rubbing for the back aches
While dames be in the cellar cookin' macaroons and pancakes
(Hu hu hu)
(Shyeah, shyeah, shyeah, shyeah)
I've no right to political fame
But I won't settle to this meddle build a fortress out of mansions
And that might force a couple things
If this production sees no movie
When the [recrea ?] bell rings
Don't you question my domain
You silly peasants have no say
So my demeanor is the season
Where my ghouls run from the graves
They say it's simple as my chain
To keep the factories a-runnin'
All the sugars that you crave, boy

[Verse 2: Busdriver]
(Yeah, yeah)
Let's go
Like the chocolate factory super independent
[?] [recollations ?] through demented
Divvy it all [abide ?] divide 'em
You could get let go probably to independent
We could be [?]
And I become the black hood [?] walker
Rulin' other workers like [?]
I go all in
[Hopin'?] for the personality
The [?] government really wants to cripple my economy
With sactions on the cocoa plate
But I'm so so amped
I don't give a fuck
I [?] and I
Hit the niggers with the anecdotal
[?] to make you [?]
Then they change the tax code in their bath robes
Like a pragmatic [?]
Spinning, spinning, whining, pocket lining
Of the [?] lobbyists' oppressed scientific findings
Now sugar cell good for you
Yeah, it's always been good for you
If you talkin' just pull the dandy ox snitch
You should ask the [?] where the ominous
[Booker pens ?] eugenesis [?]
Who're tuggin' em, buyin' drone pilots with no mileage
On your death box
That's why they sell chocolate at the sex shops

[Track 4: Riskytoad]
Now boy don't get your things messed up
See the squad rides slow with turtle shells and mud
It's rough, rowdy as a pot full o' chicken
That I scarfed down quick without a bone pick needed
This is don't stick dinner to the whole crowd's belly
You could feed most kitties
If it means you won't menace any problems
Baby we could bag those up
Take a cab through the [cuts ?] of alabaster dust
See it's nothing if you really want to challenge
Little old cabins
Full of my [dads ?] and guns
See they changed below this since I [casted/cast his?] sons
Gaskets [?] boy
And I roll with the muskets
Bank flows in with the [case ?] of the mud
Days passed by with the shade full of glum
Then paid by the sum
Who paid the funds, boy
Then saved by the cut
Dames flow in, couple babes for the rubber
[Games ?] in the middle now look out for the tongue
But shadow won't matter in time in the tub, boy
Shyeah, and that's a couple bubbles in the patch
And we let you out of [boyo/boil ?] with these soil cut [crump ?]
With the oil [build/billed ?] [clattenburg ?] foil through the rocks
That's a trip to old Virginia
And a room of empty thoughts, boy

[Verse 2]
That's OK, that's still dancing in moonlit gaze
Two cold nuts no [shine ?] no sway
My hands keep warm in the fair old maze
I'm thankful for the buns that they gave me
And the squad's seen spoils by the toils of the way
But among the center stages
I print pages of the [tap ?]
It is me sir, for you retards, I present this lovely plot for you

[Track 5: Wood Farm]
(Shyeah)
(It is I)
(King Kow)
See the stars ain't too far from me
To rattle up a catch
But the throttle on the [?] can push as far as you may test, yeah
Feel pressure if you ever fall behind
(I don't mind [all ?] that you find and I shall test)
And regardless of the risk just know I'm into do or die
So if I meet my peril I just hope to go in time, 'cause
We succeed before we sign
We jump down, I retell new stories of my pride
No lie, double check it, here's a sign that I reckon
Lil' fuck boys shall try and stare the strait through all these centers
Stare the strait without repentin'
Any sins that you may fathom
([?] these rules and [?] just flappin', make this faster)
Casted of a chapter
It's the ultimate remastered
[Schabilities ?] to learn [?] your voyage for the trappin'
And if you lack that passion
Get the fuck up on my back
(I need [?] )

(Fuck up on my back)
(If you can't-can't surpass me)
(Shyeah)
Get the fuck up on my back
If you can't
Surpass me

(Boy)
Get the fuck up on my back
If you can't
Surpass me

Get the fuck up on my back
If you can't
Surpass me

(Boy)
Get the fuck up on my back
If you can't
Surpass me

(Boy)

(Get the fuck up on my back)
(If you can't)
(Surpass me)

[Track 6: New Bark Town]
It is little boy, I
A mean [?] better known skelebone high
My dog stay rowdy in the [?] of grown high
She always stay buzzin' if me brew is on the side
And I don't got the platter with the [plank ?] for the duck
And bladder for the taste and a lack of better [shout ?]
A casket full o' hate and a village full o' love
Now watch it in the mirror if you wish to see the trust in 'em
But whether of it, my fellow stay fried in the oven
[?] high with a couple of eyes gettin' sluggish (whatever)
These boys go for rounds in the weather
Rain, sleet, shine shedding signs of the cheddar
And as I see it, I think that he might view it
With butter boy poopy and the ghost that I'm seeing
'Cause these dogs never make much cheddar
Couple days, couple weeks, couple months, and still nothing
Really I'm just sick of the poop
I know I'm really center stage but I forgot how to move
I've been grindin' empty levels but these stats never boost
And I've been tearing through the layers
But forgot how to groove
And these stars that I harvest
Claim a bigger stake for the fate that I bargain with
That's the case, that's some overpaid gardening
'Cause these pots haven't bloomed yet
Haven't moved yet
Haven't thought to make away from the doom scent
Sit and wait for the rakes after broom swept
Another day in the rain and the dew
I refuse just to sit in the face of delusion
'Cause I am I, sir president of fleet
Fencemen ready to die so I'm steady
Man I've seen cities so believe that I do
Playing willy with committees take control over you
Too
