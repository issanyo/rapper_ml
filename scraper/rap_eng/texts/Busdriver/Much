[Hook]
Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?
My homies doing too much
Suit up, boot up, you what
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
Now you know all about us
We doing too much, now you know how to go like this

[Verse 1]
Imagine, the day you win, they gonna say you way too lit and exchange it quick
Recall the awkward dude who I once was
They stretch that swagger into metadata in the rumor mill
Now you got your syndicated show and your movie deal
But ladies say your music kill, but you can't pass no background check
And you may have a boarding pass to hop up on that outbound jet
But you're doing too much
Let me show you how to
With a little artful solo we can all play Marco Polo
With the creation myth, the bits between your ears ain't jailbroken
You may be doing way too much when executives say you suck
In the deal memo, in short hand, while the tour van got the tail smoking
The propagandists hate all this literary zest, and, my itinerary's in French
Because my past commentaries, that shit's incendiary at best
And you was each and every sense
And I'm the reason why you walking out
The only thing you talk about

[Hook]
Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?
My homies doing too much
Suit up, boot up, you what
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
You know we doing too much
Now you know all about us
We doing too much, now you know how to go like this

[Verse 2]
And now you on the honor roll on the roll so you bricking jumpers
The unemployed black astronauts are out there stripping Hummers
But it ain't no big bummer, Barbara's the actress and mixing colors
But it's not like I grow weed to turn up all my Biofeed
I'm a wild steed
And I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff
And I'm doing too much
I may dislocate my rotator cuff
And I'm doing too much
I'm probably gonna get these Gators scuffed
I can rap so pimp, tax exempt
Whoa
Me branching out is tantamount to an overflow, I played electric blues in dress shoes on the corner store, so spread the news
Checking some coffee brand I end up getting body scanned
On the way into Nottingham, they've criminalized my negritude
I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff
And I'm doing too much
I may dislocate my rotator cuff
And I'm doing too much
I'm just doing all of my favorite stuff, yeah

[Hook]
Um, who the fuck are you talkin' about if you ain't talkin' about us?
I go so deep, you know we don't sleep and I been awake for months
Going too dumb is our rule of thumb so, who is such and such?
My homies doing too much
Suit up, boot up, you what
You know we doing too much
