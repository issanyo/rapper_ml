Sorry... is all that you can say
Years go by and still
The words won't come easily
Like sorry, like sorry

Forgive me... is all that you can say
Years go by and still
The words won't come easily
Like forgive me, forgive me
But you can say baby, baby can I hold you tonight
And maybe if I told you the right words, ooo at the right time, you'll be mine

I love you... is all that you can say
Years go by and still
The words won't come easily
Like I love you, I love you
But you can say baby, my baby can I hold you tonight
And maybe if I told you the right, ooo at the right time, you'll be mine. [x2]
