Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Listen babe

Everytime I see you, I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin' of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say

[Avant] (Foxy Brown)
1 - When we were together (Fox Brown c'mon)
We never turned our backs on each other (Yeah)
But now that we're separated (Yeah nigga, separated)
We can't stand one another

[Foxy]
I can't stand you nigga
Shit be as simple as that
Thought you had it all cuz my ass was phat
Bitch rockin' the Prada suits with the Gucci boots
Sceamin' on some mad loot, four fifth and I shoot
Hard game straight down to the verses
Image Fox Brown, c'mon out lyrical cursin'
Avant separated, nigga it can't be
I'mma keep on rockin' the mic
Cuz that's the way it be
I'm just a bad girl, na na illa on tracks
Thinkin' I'mma leave ya lonely, shit nigga relax

[Avant]
I don't wanna be wit you, put that on everything I own
I can't believe I stayed around that damn long
If I never see you again, I won't be mad at all, no no
Cuz I believe that you're my downfall
You did me wrong

2 - You did me wrong
I thought you were true
You ran out of my life
And now I'm so through with you

I wanted you to be there
Right here with me, oh

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

[Foxy]
Peep the ice, baby blue Bentley
The g string rocked
Labels up stocked, and the bottles of Cris' popped
Non stop, in the summer to the winter and shit
Never gonna get stuck with the ill na na bitch
With the frozen wrist
Too much for some cats
They play-hatin' from the back
Done shit simple as that
Sellin' mills with the hint of rhyme
I sell records, I keep niggas laced out
Cop 2 million or better with the jew-els in my pocket
Playin' niggas on the low
Got my creep going on in the S-5-0
I'm just gonna keep doing this shit 'till the day I die
Na na one luv, niggas don't cry, Peace!

It's really over babe
Cuz you did me wrong

Repeat 2

[Avant]
I remember when you used to sit there
I'd hold you in my arms and you would say to me
Yeah yeah
