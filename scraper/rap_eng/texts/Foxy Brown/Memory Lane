[Intro: Foxy Brown]
Hip-hop, Brooklyn!

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Damn, the rap game done changed
Everytime I turn around niggas spittin' nigga's names
'96 was when the love was real
When Big came and took the whole Brooklyn to fame
Straight off of St. James
Lookin' all Dapper Don, he threw on Party & Bullshit, it was on
And, B.I.G. spot'll never be claimed
'Cause Mrs. Wallace, Cease and Roc they carry your name
And later on in '96 when Hovi came and
Ain't No Nigga was the key to his fame
Introducin' a little Brooklyn girl by the name of Fox Brown
About to shut this rap shit down and
To the world we was Bonnie & Clyde
And everything my nigga Jay said I'm ready to ride
Then I'll Be came to skyrocket our fame
And 2 million sales later bet I rode the same, and

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Nas sample]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
Damn, the rap game done changed, and
Then Nas came and The Firm was born
We snatched AZ and Mega and our team was born
I took 'em on Puff tour, turn around Nas gone
And the whole crew follow, what a hard pill to swallow and
I had to thug it out and go in the zone
And rock 30 thousand on my muh'fuckin' own but
I couldn't break down, I couldn't moan
I got this Ill Na Na blood in my veins, I spar alone!
Then 4 weeks later Puff ended at home at the Garden
The show I came up on the throne
See I, can't believe my niggas left me alone
And I don't buy the shit about Puff was treatin' 'em wrong
How the fuck we tryna pull weight on this man tour?
At the time Puff 8 mil, the fuck you mad for?
That's the problem with niggas, see they worse than broads
Want a bitch to conceal they scars, yeah

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Nas sample]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
It's called the vapors
Soon as you stack some paper
These cowards got the nerve to face ya
They got the gall to page ya
How the fuck you have a lil' soldier and replace her with a dozier
But like I told ya Fox is a trooper
I'll walk straight pass ya like I never fuckin' knew ya
Listen man, I'm the first bitch to sign to Def Jam
How can't I be the best, I'm from the best, man
'97 was the year Kim came with her best plan
To go straight at her best friend
I thought it was a cute lil' spar
'Till I heard her on the Flex tape describin' my car
Mo' money, mo' problems, kid
I guess you never did expect me to blow this big and
I know my fans won the battle I fought
But understand I keep her breathin', I'm her life support

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Nas sample]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
