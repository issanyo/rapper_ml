[Intro: Foxy Brown]
Oh (oh) and it don't stop, okay
This right here, TM what up baby
Amerie, you in the streets now baby!

[Verse 1: Amerie]
Boy you know, you know, I seen you for a while
And I don't know, I don't know but I can tell by your smile
Something bout the way that you look at me, it's tellin' me
All that you want to say, before you even speak, yeah

[Chorus: Amerie]
Everytime our eyes meet (everytime)
They be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (yeah)
Talkin', talkin', talkin' (they be) talkin' to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (no, no, no)
(cuz everytime) they be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin' (tonight) talkin' to me (yeah)

[Verse 2: Amerie]
Boy you know, you don't have to say a word
Cuz everything you want to say, I've already heard
Baby come to me, won't you show me what this could be
Cuz I just want to give you all my love (oh oh oh oohhh)

I know they can't see (they just can't see)
How a love unspoken can be so deep (can be so deep)
Cuz everytime that you look my way (oohh ohhh)
I see, what your heart wants to say to me
