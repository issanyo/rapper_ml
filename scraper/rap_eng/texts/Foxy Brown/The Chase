Uhhhh yeahhhh uh, The Firm
Lust... hate... envy... jealousy
Connivin niggas
Nigga nature, uh, yeah

Jumped out the ride, floss high, black tie
Cocoa to lye, three guys, slanted eyes
I shoulda tried, sweet thugs stay dove
Up in the Land, crash bar ill beam
They threw this CREAM, my whole team must fiend
The ghetto dream, Fox Boog, jigged up
Stay in the cut like WHAT, layin in the Bentleys
Stoned, flossed on, me and Capone
Picasso, Mardi Gras, play the low in a six-double-oh
Benz chrome, dominicano
Superstar Lila Escobar holy matrimon'
Tied to The Firm, die for The Firm
So help me God, street life played right
I got his wife, hemmed up, in bun
Nigga two to the gut

*chorus*
Nowhere to rest nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high speed chase and death is on my mind
Will I fall or fail who call the shots it's all real
Firm, get on your job, niggas, what the deal
(repeat 2X)

Mahogany Brown laid it down, shoulda seen her
Threw the heater, to the grill, it was real
Pure steel, my niggas peel murderin, gunnin through Queens
In Beams, forty-four chrome, Mac-11 stow it in they jeans
Pretty thugs, Firm team
Hold it down, we hold the crown
Got it locked rock shop, heron caught
Out of town breeze through, he had a Z2 baby blue
No clue, we had this whole life planned
Call the fam lay low, Firm style let it flow

*chorus*
(repeat 2X)

He was dressed, in a sky blue Guess
Eva wrecks, we played the left, no threat
We had him shook, couldn't look, dripped sweat
He coulda fried, I seen his eyes, yeah nigga
'Mega fly, Doe or Die, fifty eye ay
Cop way Firm stray, high stake Boo
Ill booth how we do, Boogie top gun
Phillipine black thing, you know the stee Dunn
A-filliation, caramel brown
Ill style complexion, you know the deal
How we roll, like a vir-gin, on the low
Yeah Boo get your swerve on, how we do
Crew Boog's got it locked bigga, for the crew
Hold it down niggas fo' peala, fo' killa
Fo'reala, ho squeala, they know the deala
Shit is reala, Firm for real

*chorus*
(repeat 2X)
