[Intro: Young Gavin]
Fox Five, let's go

[Verse One: Foxy Brown]
See it ain't no party like a Fox Brown party
Cuz a Fox Brown party don't stop
But them bottles a pop, when Fox Five come through in the drop
With chinchilla on my back, it's the King {bitch} of rap
Catch us ?, up in bungalow eight
Rollin' through in the cranberry SK8 and
Call the crew, tell 'em come to the crib
I did my time, it's all water under the bridge
I got knocked and it felt like a part of my life
But I'm, back home I'mma party tonight
Through the pool party since no-one else is home
All my friends happy for me tell me "Welcome home" and
Yeah I know I got busted for a crime
Now I'm tryna have fun and make up for lost times
The world is mine, I'm so refocused
But I'm back this time and I'm back to grind, so

[Chorus: Red Handed] (Young Gav)
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun (let's have fun then)
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun (I like that)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (what you drinkin'?)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (I like that, c'mon)

[Verse Two: Foxy]
And, this is how it's 'sposed to be
No police, all night, hopefully, cuz
We got Armadale vodka too, I got
One of my homies on the ones and twos and
The food is banging, the hate is gone
The speakers blasting the latest songs
And all that time they had me alone
Now I'm, with my family, I'm happy I'm home and
We two-stepping cuz it's back in style
My friends laughin' and acting wild
See this type of thing, happen all the time
But you gotta get yours, just like I'm gon' get mine
Everything is fine, with my friends I pack a whole place in
For one day I forget the probation
I won't stop til the party is done and see I'm gon' have some fun!

[Chorus]

[Red Handed]
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, cuz a Fox Five party don't stop
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, cuz a Fox Five party don't stop

[Verse Three: Foxy]
Yeah I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine
You see I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine, so, yeah
I can't forgive 'em, I'm living my life different
I'm seeing just what I'm missing, I ain't tryna go to prison again
They got me on constant watch, but
Anything is better than to be on lock

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

[Foxy]
Yeah, uh huh, woo
Fox Brown, Fox Brown
Fox Brown, Fox Brown
