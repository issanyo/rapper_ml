Me da orignial ras cluda

(Aiy, aiy, aiy, aiy)
Jusy give me some room!
(Stinkin gyal!)
Make ya momma sing!

[Verse 1]
My guns, my funds keep both in eye range
Put holes in foes that think that I change
Hot slugs in thugs that pose and act tough
So quick, you get kidnapped and smacked up
My ways amazed
All those opposing
I'm grown, I own extensive clothing
Go shopping cop five pairs of Hoagings
The five elite bet Fox is chosen
Can't beat her or clone her
Know some bitches boasting like Winona
Ya'll know Fox a rider
But if need be put six shots inside her
Leave her dead in the basement
Get a replacement
Reason to fear Fox
Scare rap bitches half to death
To knees shake and tears drop
Jump in car when I hear cops
One girl, me against the world
How can you not compare Pac?

Jusy give me some room!
(Bloodclots)

[Verse 2]
F-O, X-Y
You know the kids raw
The streets itself is what I live for
My "Reign" will last, some hoes I'm fading
The flow you know is most amazing
My slanted eyes, I'll never trade in
Trini in me and mixed with Asain
See I know how fe-el to start broke
I'm hood, I could still roll through Park Slope
It's the music that you hear on blocks
My raps got through your blood like a herion shot
Yeah!
I got these rap dudes switching sides
I'm the gutterest, goodiest bitch alive and
Fox 5, believe my team works
I'ma silent partner
Call me Kareem Burks
I'ma spit long as you find me alive
The Firm bitch!
First chick to true Bonnie & Clyde, pussy

(Hey, hey! Girnd dem pussy boy!)

[Verse 3]
Check it, check it
If them not ready
Foxy move back ya bloodclots
My accent flow, ya'll know my shit rock
Orignial true bad gyal of hip-hop
Them not ready!
Them know my shit pop
Ya'll have reason to fear Fox
Scare rap bitches half to death
Knees shake and tears drop
Jump in the car when I hear fox
One girl, me against the world
How can you hate the Brown Fox?
