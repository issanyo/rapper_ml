[Verse 1:]
I need to be repaid for all the love I gave
So I'm wiping out the savings, maxing out the Visa
All because you cheated on me
Cruising down Rodeo on a shopping spree
For all your lying and your scheming, 'bout to have you screaming
I'm buying up everything (Oops)

[Pre-Chorus:]
There goes the dreams we use to save (Oops)
There the goes the times we spent away (Oops)
There's goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that's now (Oops)
There goes the house we made a home (Oops)
There goes your number leave me alone (Oops)
For all the lies you told, This is what you owe

[Chorus:]
Hey ladies, When your man wanna get buckwild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Oops)
Get your hands on the cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Ooh, ooh, went to Gucci and Prada
Ooh, ooh, bought the whole enchilada
Ooh, ooh, If you wanna hit 'em up
Get the keys to the truck and go smash it up now

[Rap: Foxy Brown]
(Oww!)
The way I used to ride that dick proper (Oops)
Fuck around and have them niggas pop ya (Oops)
I been patient, now I'm back with another one
No press, gangsters don't give statements
You too blatant, Bentleys and Porsches racin'
Take Rolies, Carties, give em facelifts
I keep it real basic, nigga face it, shit
Duke, I made you, why would I play you?

[Verse 2: Blu Cantrell]
Chase vampire, mister chase vampire
Gettin' all your goods then set 'em on fire
Cleaning out your closet, and taking the deposit
I'm taking it to the extreme
I'm tired of all the games you played
So I'm getting away
Having a fiesta with Sole and Mia
Taking a vacation for free (Oops)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] (2x)
