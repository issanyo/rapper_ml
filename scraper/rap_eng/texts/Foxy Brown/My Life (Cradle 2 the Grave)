[Verse One]
From the cradle until now, still Fox, just a little more mature
Seen it with my bare eyes, did it all before, been through hell on earth
Playing out my role I was given since birth, recepting it well
Go hard at them critics, they expect me to fail, work hard for my fans
They expect me to sell, they suspect I'm living well
But they don't know the pain I feel, five minutes away from getting killed
It's ill, my moms' always hug me when I'm leaving
I wake up crying because death bugs me when I'm sleeping
Jam Master died, it's like I ain't done grieving
Big and Pac gone, and look, we still beefing
And son, even, we at odds in these days
Where niggers' die over cars and their chains
I thank God that I'm saved and I'm a hold it down in this game
Now, from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Verse Two]
From the cradle until now, I been through it all, y'all
Y'all don't know half the things, I been through it, dog
Pain and suffering, I been through it all, my heart's still cold
I been through the storm, confused all these years
Shit, we grew all these years, I remember me and you on the stairs
Talking about what we're going to do when we're big
Money came into play and best friends went they way, shit
I wish it never had to go that way
The price of fame can cost a whole friendship
Yeah we got dollars, but it's senseless
So I pray to God for forgiveness, and ask him to carry me through
All the stress, and the drama in this business, I bare witness
I Fox, and keep going strong until my heart stop
And keep flowing strong with a -, come on

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way

[Bridge]
As a little girl, I wish I knew that I would be going through the drama That's in my life, all the suffering, everywhere I've been
How I get myself in all this bullshit I'm in

[Verse Three]
From now until the grave, I look back at my life, smile, and say 'wow'
In amazement, all these roadblocks, wonder how did I make it
Wonder how I became famous, I'm impressed with me
It's like rumours been obsessed with me, but the truth's never told
It was left with me, and what's left for me is to extend my hand
If they don't reach then I'll let them be, I've got to live my life right
But I wouldn't change how I lived my like
If I could live my life twice, y'all don't understand what Inga's life's like
A black stressed, I turned my back to the world, and now I'm back to the world
This black girl's blessed, yeah, my fans helped me through it
I was destined to blaze from the cradle to the grave
Thank God my family helped me through it

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way
