Bust your guns, uh, uh, yeah

Show a little thigh, make this nigga's eyes pop out
Sieze him with the cleavage
I want you to make this nigga believe he 'bout eat it

[F] They ain't ready for us, nigga
[J] Obviously
[F] Sound like Bonnie and Clyde to me

[Foxy]
I protect you like a vest do
I'm the lady with a 380 special right next to you
Glock poppin' out the stock
And it's two guns, two hun', get down
I tear this whole shit down
They ain't know the vault, pull bank jobs
I banged ya squaw when I aims this rod
Y'all niggas can't do a thing to this broad
My bullets hurt the same as y'alls
I've been taught by the best, extorted the rest
Wearin' a niggas shit, crossin' my chest
Life on the line, say prayers under my breath
But knew I'd be 'aight cuz right there to my left
(Right)

[Jay-Z]
Hova baby, told you baby
Big gun right over your left shoulder baby
Same nigga that taught you how to hold that 80
From day one 'til we old and crazy
Let's kill the world

Repeat 1

[Jay-Z]
Ran up at Chemical
The bank robbers in our routine is like St. Bernards swimmin'
Everybody hit the floor, guys and women
Kids rush for the door
Keep your cry to a limit
Time check ma, we got about 5 minutes
Before the authorities rush and the FBI's in it
That teller's up to something, look, his eyes are squinted

[Fox] Don't let that button be the reason why you're finished

[Jay-Z] Yeah, the sky's the limit 'til we reach B.I.G
[Fox] Meet Jesus, confess to him all the shit we did
[Jay-Z] Gotta reverse the six, let's murd' head jerk
Almost got whiplash
[Fox] We got a shitload of cash
Throws it in the stash
Long as we keep shitin' like this
Shit, ain't nothin' fuckin' with this
You my Clyde for life
I'm your Bonnie like this
I can see us gettin' rich like this nigga

Repeat 1

Ad lib until fade
