Talkin' shit about me to a deaf room
Yo Fox, murder that pussyclat
On some bloodclat
Yo Fox, murder that bloodclat

Brooklyn, I'ma kill this bitch
The take over, you fakes over, nigga
Got a little shine, okay, thank Mona
Heard your little rhymes, okay, Brooklyn, I'm on
I'm on my '96 shit, got the DNA of Hova
And Nick my bitch, but bitch I'm sayin'
I'm where the carcass layin'
Bitch I am not playin
When we was on the island
Rem was in PC shook
She was never tough, she was never wylin'
The bloodclat this
Y'all better tell this bum bitch
Foxy was born to shit
This dusty ass broad think she somethin' sweet
She give the part to a Hot 97 in this street
You still in that dirty ass TS piece
And Pap fucked that dirty ass BX beast
I'm a mothafuckin' BK savage, you heard?
And I heard about that bitch miscarriage
Brooklyn, I'm a killer
The Garden Reggie Miller
The Barclay's floor seat, all black chinchilla

Yo Fox, murder that pussyclat
