[Intro]
Ughh, gimme some
Ughh, yeah, yeah, yeah, heh
Ughh, get sticky wit it
Ughh, get your name back
Not that, ughh

[Foxy]
Nigga wanna lay up on my couch, watchin' cable
Hands all in his pants, feet all on my table
Niggas I don't know, rollin' 'dro
Optimo', blow you got to go nigga, out the door
Tryin' to throw some hints
It's the first of the month, time to pay some rent
You could send them niggas home and hit the streets
Cuz you been layin' up chillin' in this bitch for weeks
Know that ice is nice and sticks is sleek
And the fridge is full, but the shit ain't sweet
Nigga get cause to floss, keep shit that's new
Sure, you could charge it but the bill is due
See ballers like you gotta pay to play
Y'all Big Pun niggas gotta pay like you weigh
You could come by, shit, but you can't stay
Let my girl Mya sing what I came to say, c'mon

[Mya]
1 - Cuz ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me
Cuz ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me

[Foxy]
I need a heavy trick with a deadly dick
With a Benz two-thousand SE 6, 's watch, whatever
As long as the Bezzy sit at least three
TVs in everywhere
I ain't tryin' to go to court for child support
In a crib cramped up, fighting for Pampers
I don't want dram's wit' ya'll baby moms
Nigga, all I want is Cartier Charms
Been tryin' to take it there, fuck the movies
I'm a red carpet bitch, nigga, world premiere
Shit, I ain't your average I-got-to-have-shit
And I'm a shopaholic, with a heavy shoe habit
Not one two, I need a few karats
Nigga try suffer, buy a stiletto
And I gotta have them Perotta bags
And them shopping sprees and alotta cash, c'mon

Repeat 1

If you wanna fuck, I could spend
If you wanna front, gotta go
If you got dough, let 'em in
If you go broke, it ain't the end
Remember how you did it before?
Let's do it again

You could start from the bottom
Take it to the top
Start it from the Hoopty, end it in the Drop
Wanna know the secret how you stay on me?
You gotta get on, stay on your J.O.B., c'mon

Repeat 1

No romance without finance
(Repeat until fade)
