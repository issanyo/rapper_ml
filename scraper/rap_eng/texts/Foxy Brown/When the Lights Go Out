Whoa! (Ill Na Na)

1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1: Kiara]
Here we go, buckle up
'Cause you know we about to go
Take a trip to a place
Somewhere like outer space
Don't be scared, I'm the captain
Anything can happen to you, boy
But I won't hurt you, boy

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
Throw the pussy down like a porno star
Me and my girls real hard in the Bentley Arnage
A whife line skirt and chinchilla fur
My bitch tiff keep a bottle of Cris
In a glass top six and that's my bitch
F double O-X B double O-G-I-E
My na na na na tastes like Jamaican kiki
Ain't a bitch freaky like me
When the lights go out I'm show you what I'm about
Matter fact playboy open you mouth (come here)
Lemme take you on a tour down south

[Hook: Kiara]
Baby, when the lights go out
I want you to show me what you really all about
Baby, when the lights go out
I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
Theme park, thrill ride, pay attention, let's fly
Baby, when the lights go out
I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
I only met one nigga that deserved it
He a gangsta so he worth it
I make them pretty boys nervous
Ya'll already know who this is
The bitch that throwback vicious
I ain't like your grandma
I ain't them other rap bitches
Throw it up in mad positions
From the bathroom to the kitchen
On the table fuck the dishes
They fall to the floor
While I give you the business
And I'm so flexible that I'll stretch and pull that ass up real properly
Can't fuck with the ill na na
Can't fuck with the ill na na
Can't fuck with the ill na na
1, 2, 3, 4
[Hook: Kiara]
Baby, when the lights go out
I want you to show me what you really all about
Baby, when the lights go out
I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster
Theme park, thrill ride, pay attention, let's fly
Baby, when the lights go out
I'm gonna light up your life
Take you for a ride on this rollercoaster

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
The boy can't handle the na na
Let him put one hand on the na na
Then I'll let him get a sniff of the na na
Your boy came to quick for the na na
Then I'll let him get a lick of the na na
Let that boy get stiff than a na na
See my pun-pun print to the fellas
Something like the black medallion

[Bridge: Kiara]
Boy relax your mind it will be alright
Just hold and I'll bang you right
Lights go out cause imma light up your life
So what you gonna do

[Hook: Kiara]
Baby, when the lights go out

Theme park, thrill ride, pay attention, let's fly
Baby, when the lights go out
