Chorus:
You gonna make me fuck somebody else (I'm gonna fuck somebody)
If you keep on treating me the way you do
(you don't wanna do it, you don't wanna do it)
You gonna make me fuck somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do
(you don't wanna do it, you don't wanna do it)

Verse one: foxy brown
Most of these cats ain't got nothing for me, but if we talikng g's
That's a different story, now don't embarass yourself
Cause if you ain't pushin' what I'm tryin' to push next year
You talking for ya health, nigga rock on
Check where you come from, you now my stee dun
Run a g and leave 'em strung with they tongue hung, niggas is bold now
I puts the gold down, I ain't laughing
Cats be asking can they lick my hole now, feel free
Nigga eat me, treat me
Ya trick, pussy clit lickin'
No ass gettin' dick, first roles
Niggas is my hoes, top my doe
Wanna lace me with some head after my show, bringin' dat
I'm the nasty bitch that I am, make 'em lick my pearl tongue
And you got to give my girls some, fuck a man
Bitch got the world in her hand, just on spite
Niggas got to fuck me right

Chorus:

Verse two: foxy brown
Aye yo fox quit the pp on niggas that is ricky
Have them cats wining like be-be and ce-ce, ill na na
Pussy hot like a sauna, have yo dick doin' flips in my teddy by gabanna
Can yo baby's momma keep it wet like this, sex like this
Nigga this is the best it gets, been around the world twice
Gettin' more ice, bomb ass cock
Fuck a nigga all night, for you bitch kept the pussy tight
All night, nasty when I wanna
Pussy you make me wonder, any eye in me
Keep vibin' me, roll a nigga got the word that he coppin' threes
They call him long dick steve, make the pussy steamy
Lips in the ass with his face thug cree, y'all should've seen him
Nigga dick mad tiny, doin' tricks like a muthafuckin' genie

Chorus:

Verse thre: foxy brown
Now niggas get a nut just to watch me strut, niggas tried knockin' me up
Locking me down, what clown copped me a truck
But I ain't need it, he passed me da blunts but I don't get weeded
Smoke the put bush, let him eat it
Let's him get high then his face in my thigh, while I'm in his ride
Fuck a nigga todd, screamin' my name
Cum stains on the wood grain, had a good thang
But the truth is your loose lips mad me ruthless, now you sex what
Jerk it, it's for certain
Had him spend up, had him bent up
Got the next nigga none in ya benz truck
Ain't nothing wrong with a good dick, fuck a trick
Suck a dick, let no trick
Nigga pass up, fuck the last nut
Get a ass up uhh the next what, can a nigga do
But fuck you and ya crew with down ass hoes

Chorus:
You gonna make me fuck somebody (you gonna make fuck somebody)
You gonna make me fuck somebody (if you keep fucking up the way you do)
You gonna make me fuck somebody (ohh fuck somebody)
You gonna make me fuck somebody (you're gonna make me fuck somebody)
