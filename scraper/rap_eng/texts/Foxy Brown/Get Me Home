[Intro: Foxy Brown & Blackstreet]
Uh, yeah
(Ay-ayy)
Firm biz, what it is, Blackstreet
Na Na, steady rise, peep that out
Oooh, (baby)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Gotta get you home)

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Hold up, let's take it from the top, I Fox
Gets my swerve on, floss pure rocks
In the six drop boo and it don't stop
See money lookin' alright, yeah, what up Pop?
Cross the room throwin' signals, I'm throwin' 'em back
Flirt-in 'cause I digs you like that
Peep baby boy style, hopin' we match
You sent me Crown Royale with a note attached
It said, "You look like the type that know what you like"
I could tell by the je-wels you go for the ice
Plus you wear the shoes well, the suit flows nice
I don't like the notes too well, let's be more precise
Meet me by the VIP, let's pow-wow
Whisper in my ear like, "Boo, let's bounce now"
I'm 'bout to say peace to my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you
He said

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
Oooh baby
(Gotta get you home with me)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Oooh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight
C'mon, c'mon

[Verse 2: Foxy Brown]
At the bar high-post, frontin', I toast
Gettin' my flirt on, playa, ain't nothin'
You tryna say the right words to get us out of here
Jackpot, what he said, "It's bullshit in here"
And his smile blind like the shine on his necklace
Mind tellin' me no, body tellin' me exit
Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses
Uh, twist my body like the Exorcist, hey
The way he licked his lips he was mackin'
True thug passion, I'm like, "Slow down before you crashin'"
Never mind him, he ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way we sex, on the villa up in Malibu
Marry who? Daddy please
I'm takin' it all from the stash to the keys, so let me see
Boo, I'm 'bout to dead my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you
He said

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
Oooh baby
(I need you, want you in my life)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Gotta get you home with me tonight)
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Oooh baby
(Baby, I need you right here)
Gotta get you home with me tonight

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
Outside of the club talkin' to valet
Mind started to stray million miles away
Contemplatin' goin' back to his crib to par-lay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
Eyes sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-Ta's perkin', you're makin' me high like Toni
Work me, take me, I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to reality, the Soul II Soul
Breathin' heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
(Tonight baby)
Oooh baby
(C'mon, c'mon, Foxy c'mon)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Whatever you want me to do)
Uh-oh, uh-oh (do it for you, baby)
Oooh baby
(I need it in my life)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
