[Foxy Speaking:]
Yo, Dam, I'm tellin' you Tiff
This nigga Regardless Devon hold the cash (flaawless)
We got give a nigga some ass to get to the boss
Yo all the mutherfuckin' drug dealers we use to dream
About when we were young
I swear to God that's my word

[Foxy Verse 1:]
I got dreams of fuckin' with this young don name Shaquan
(Devon)
That's word to my moms she turned me on
That's word to (Jean) Gaffney
(Dayton Ohio Library Purchaser)
He could have smashed
Cops to a quarter, I wish I gave him a daughter for real
I used to dream of niggas like henduse
His outpost snitched I rather fuck be the shoe
Ah!
I'm addicted to drug dealers
Young 17 fuckin' with drug niggas
You now killers like pap and prince miller
From queens. la baprime, I seen him in my dreams
I use to feen for the call least to wake up late nights
Watin' for them to call me
True story before the lime light
It was cars, trucks, and bikes
Fox and D-Knights
And ever since I was a child
Use to stay dreamin' about Kevin chaws

[Jay Rush Chorus:]
Whatever happened to the days
Lookin' around and it's all chagned
Only the snitches and wannabees
American ganstas are history
Whenever you need me I'll Be there
I've done all my ways compare
I'm a beast up in the streets
Baay girl there's no need

[Foxy Verse 2:]
It was all a dream, like Big said
When I woke up, dam, semmed like the city was dead
What's up New York New York, nobody gettin' bread

Noweverybody a gansta nobody got cheeder
My dreams were so much better
Big money from gold getters
Minks in the cold weathers
Chris in advance kush
Remebr Bush
Big L son and Lu Harv
Homicide Lu and Boy George
Just see him go to sleep in tha car
And pop a few pills
Turn me on for reals
You know Foxsend shots to hit you
Then I fuck a nigga like wane Perry
Since I was young, use to dream of fuckin' with habnow
Poppin' bottles while he suckin' or swallow

[Jay Rush Chorus:]
