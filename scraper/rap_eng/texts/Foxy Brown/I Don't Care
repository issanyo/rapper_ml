[Chyna White]
Yo, consider me a roll model if there's beef in the club
I'm that lil' white bitch that's gonna throw bottles
Me and the fam has this whole model
Fuck you, fuck them, fuck all uh yall
So what if this is not the kids?
So what if there's a hundred labels that got the bid?
So what if I dreamed the devil never dared me to sin?
So what if the industry compares me to him?
So what if I write hard?
Or is it really just a big fuckin' deal cuz' it's comin' from a white broad
So what, hear me so what?!
If I bring it most of these rappers gon' fold up
I don't care if I might be on top, I can give a flyin' fuck
If you like me or not
So what if you think I'm not the illest chick?
I don't care you still gotta feel dis bitch
I don't care

[Hook]
