Bredring let me work it to you slow
Throwbacks to throw back I'm mean niggas really though
Get you a Ryan King button up bucket low
Jay got y'all niggas dressing up for real, got every young
Hood nigga looking like for real
Ain't no telling what the Fox will do?
I'm in the Phantom stunting something like a Rasta do
FUCK Gulliani! I'm right here in Chiprianni
With the shottyboy aiming at y'all battyboys
Mommy's home and I got the FOURTY AUTOMATIC CHROME
For all the chatty chatty y'all been doing!

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jimmy Hendrix] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Aiyyo! NINE straight years critics might not
Admit it but no bitch in rap did it quite like FOX
Did it, and it's before I wore it, I did it so Lovely
I got tiered of it I don't ware it no more
And that goes from everything from the
Christian Dior to Christon Luibiton
They got a problem Shawn
Fours years gone I'm stil holding the belt
Ain't got to tell you I'm the best
Homie ain't nothing else
Holla!

[Chorus: Foxy Brown & Jimmy Hendrix] - repeat 4X
