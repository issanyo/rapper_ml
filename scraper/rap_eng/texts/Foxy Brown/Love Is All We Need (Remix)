[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Trackmasters, Commisioner
You say you keep me laced in everything, baguettes his and her
Matchin' E-class, twin chincilla furs
Everything was real 'til he slipped and swerved
Swore the love was real then he bounced with hers
Kept me off speed, blessed me backwards, made my heart bleed
Killed me softly; he don't know how much it cost me
If the love is all we need, real queens will survive
Now peep the remix with Fox and J. Blige
Come on

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I've got to let you know
That this is the only way (let 'em know)
Troubles far and near, but have no fear
'Cause love is always on the way
Oh, love

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (So complete, love)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
If you don't know, then I'm telling you
It works with everything you do
Problems every day, but we'll find a way
'Cause love is going to save the day (Come on)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(To make every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all, love is all, all we need)
Love is all we need (All we need)
To make every little thing complete
(Love is all we need)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Do you know what we really need?
Do you know that love is going to set us free? (Set us free)
Yeah, just you and me
Do you think we can live this way?
'Cause I know that love is going to save the day (Save the day)
In every way

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Every little thing complete)
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete
(It's gonna make, gonna make everything complete)

[Bridge 2: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need, love is all we need)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way we can live)
Love is all we need to make things better
(Love is all we need to make everything complete)
It's the only way to live together
(It's the only way, the only way to live together)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Love is all we need (It's all we need)
To make every little thing complete (Make everything complete)
Love is all we need (All we need is love)
To make every little thing complete
Love is all we need
