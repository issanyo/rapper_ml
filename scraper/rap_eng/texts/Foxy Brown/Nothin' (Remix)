And an H-Todd jean and a good shoe on now
Catch me in the hood stylin proper
Them dudes say I spit like a dude in a bitch body
[Noreaga]
Home boy, I'm drunk in the club and won't hurl
Home boy, I'm leavin the club with white girl
Home boy, get out of my face and just taste
Home boy, I'm leavin this spot with new case
UH-OH, see these niggas gotta stay in they lanes
With a clown ass Foxy and they ain't the same
At the white boy club, while I'm buyin the bar
They like hey now you still an all star (Heh Heh)

Girls with my jock, with my dough intro
[Maze]

You know its rough, rugged, hard cuz i'm P
