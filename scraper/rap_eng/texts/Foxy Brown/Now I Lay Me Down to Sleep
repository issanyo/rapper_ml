[Intro]
Hey
Yo Gav I'm wide awoke, fam
Fox

[Verse 1]
Am I the most prolific
Can it be that I'm one of the most gifted
I swear at times I'm so twisted
Outta all the occupations in the world I chose this shit
Momma, tell me, do I have what it takes to be
Irreplacably the best this place will see
And yes I'm hated
And will I go down in history as one of the most underestimated
Lord, speak to me, are these streets the key?
We don't snitch, we been sworn to secrecy
I never claimed I shot guys
I just came in the game to get my name and rep Fox 5
I'm so close yet so far but so far
No stars flow hard like I do
So many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

[Hook]
(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yes, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thng to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh god
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
Fox, I gotta get my rhyme on
And everything I speak my mind on be word to Big

[Verse 2]
The industry lately's been terrible
I swear the timing's impeccable
Labels is bringin' in thin revenue
I don't mean to toot my own horn but damn, I'm incredible
See I gots to be, possibly
If not the best, yeah, fuck it the best MC
And I feel they testin' me now
I don't need Kelly or Beyonce to prove I'm Destiny's Child
Thin I'm losin' y'all, confusin' y'all
When I spit all I hear is "ooh's" and "aww's"
And I don't need doubt
See it's just me, Red, Gav, Curtains, Mello & Young Mouse
A small portion of a dyin' breed
It's Fox-5 slash I-N-E but still
So many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

[Chorus]
(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh god
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yes, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
Fox, I gotta get my rhyme on
And everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac

[Verse 3]
See, it's the streets that inspire me
This is my proof of what fire be
My songs will please the inquiry
My versatile personal flows written and shittin', it's like diaries
Never tired my job, I confide in God
And almost effortless simply defy the odds
With the best the placin'
Will I be able to succeed and lyrically exceed my expectations
If I gain some fame, I'll remain the same
It's so ill how one bitch changed the game
And I'mma do it a lot faster
I probably have to die before they realize I was the best rapper
Young Fox, I'm a spittin' beast
This rap game's a puzzle, I'm the missin' piece
But, so many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

[Hook]
(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yeah, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh God
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
Fox, I gotta get my rhyme on
And everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac

[Outro]
Lord, this fever is so crazy, man
I mean, everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac, yes
Oh God!
Lord..
