[Spoken Intro: Foxy Brown]
Uh, uh-huh, What?
Toni, Foxy, Come on!
Check it!

[Verse 1: Foxy Brown]
Tempatures risin', niggas fasizing
All ballas from Tallahasee to Sicily, eh-heh
And it don't stop
It goes on and on, Dom P poppin'
Straight Shon Donnin'
Na Na, remember me
The satin panties with marquies and S-classes
Me and Toni prouring with Cristale and wine galsses
Flashin', we mackin'
Brown and Braxton
Uh!

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton]
I'll always think of you
Inside of my private thoughts
I can imagine you
Touching my private parts
And just the thought of you
I can't help but touch myself
That's why I want you so bad
Just one night of

[Pre-Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Moonlight, with you there beside me
All night, doin' it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 3: Toni Braxton]
Can't get my mind off you
I think I might be obsessed
The very thought of you
Makes me want to get undressed
I want to be with you
In spite of what my heart says
I guess I want you too bad
All I want is

[Pre-Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Moonlights, with you there inside me
All night, doin it again and again
You know I want you so bad
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Bridge: Toni Braxton]
I want to feel your heart and soul inside of me
Let's make a deal, you roll, I lick
And we can go flying into ecstasy
Oh darling you and me
Light my fire
Blow my flame
Take me,take me
Take me away

[Verse 4: Foxy Brown]
I can't even imagine you sexin' another chick
Lacing her in the fly shit
Louie Viton and so on, give me chills
Shopping sprees in Beverly Hills, spendin' mills
Slippin', straight trickin'
Boutiques and all, stylin'
While you chasin' I'm playa hatin'
Contiously sleepin', I stay creepin' in the 850
Ah, playa ya makin' me high

[Chorus: Toni Braxton]
Ooooh, I get so high
When I'm around you baby
I can touch the sky
You make my temperature rise, oh boy
You're making me high
Baby, baby, baby, baby
