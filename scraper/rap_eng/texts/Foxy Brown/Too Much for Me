[Intro: Nas]
Check {*scratched*} check it out
Kay-Slay! (yeah) What up, baby
Uh, (check it out) Ame'
Haha, Bravehearts, c'mon

[Hook: Amerie]
Said it ain't too much for me
To have you next to me
I can't believe it
All the things I do
To keep you loving me
And it's just too much for me
To not have you by my side
Cause no matter what you're going through
You know that I'm gon' ride yea

[Verse: Nas]
You a brave girl? I'm a Braveheart
In craw heart and Champion Hoodies
You in the Benz Buggy with the fullies
I ride beside ya, we about to pull a all nighter
I'm +Super Freak+ like +Rick James+
Sex in rangers, parked on dangerous blocks
You like it when the strangers watch
Im' looking out for cops, you a girl with no fear
People put ya hands in the air for the GQ man of the year
That Bentley, upholstry Leather
The leather that be up in the coats I wear
Wherever I go so there ya have it
Cashmere fabrics, never caught in last years garments
Holsters under armpits, chauffers and the charms lit
And a coat is holding on the Don's wrist
She got the ill Will chain on
Turqouise boots saying "God's Son"
This the theme song

[Hook]

[Verse: Baby]
You know the size of this shit, I flips it quickly
Lose this trouble 'fore these people get with me
Holla at my hoes cause I dip my bitches
From gold to platinum from rag to riches
I'm the boss of the boss, the pimp shotcaller
Worldwide Rider in a Benz with a spoiler
In your city tear yo mall up
Pimp fly bitches and tear their walls up
Dress nice I'm super neat
Ice on white wit 3's on her feat
Worldwide Rider, I'm coast to coast
From Europe, Japan, I gets that dough
Send out 2 I get back 4
Yo broad around me I'm a lace that ho
Smoke 'dro, redo my whips
Redo my chips this the bird man bitchch

[Hook]

[Verse: Foxy Brown]
BK I throw it up, if we stay Manoloed up
Cris air canary, all these niggas hear me

Bring fever cock sucker when Foxy throw it on
I speak how I feel I'm a Fox 5 General
Y'all rap bitches is all so subliminal
That's why I ones them everytime I pass 'em
Frontin wit young G the Fox 5 Captain
So which ho wanna fuck wit huns?
So come we dun ta push a dem one by one, whoa
Now make me bust off mi big Magnum
Spray off in the lobby, call us the Shower Posse
The Don Gogen, come through styling hard
But 2 goons from the Sherlock Squadron
It be a bachelor that Fox them sparring
And leave y'all niggas on the sideline starving

[Hook]
