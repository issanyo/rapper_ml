[Sisqo]
This thing right here

[Foxy Brown]
Is the official ladies anthem
Ladies, I want you to put your drinks down
Pull your thongs up
And grab the thuggest nigga on the dance floor
Uh huh and shake your ass

[Sisqo]
Ooh that dress looks scandalous
And you know another nigga couldn't handle it
So you're shaking that thing like who's the ish
With a look in your eyes so devilish
Uh you like to dance on the hip-hop spots
And you cruise to the crews like connect the dots
Not just urban, she like her pop
Cause she was living la vida loca

1 - [Sisqo]
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what? What? What?
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt
I think I'll sing it again
She had dumps like a truck, truck, truck
Thighs like what? What? What?
All night long let me see that thong

[Sisqo]
Love it when the beat go
(Dut dun, dut dun)
When you make your booty go
(Dut dun, dut dun)
Girl I know you wanna show
(Dut dun, dut dun)
That thong, thong, thong, thong
I like it when the beat go
(Dut dun, dut dun)
Baby make your booty go
(Dut dun, dut dun)
Girl I know you wanna show
(Dut dun, dut dun)
That thong, thong, thong, thong

[Sisqo]
Listen that girl so scandalous
And you know another nigga couldn't handle it
So you're shaking that thing like who's the ish
With a look in your eyes so devilish
Uh you like to dance on the hip-hop spots
And you cruise to the crews like connect the dots
Not just urban, she like her pop
Cause she was living la vida loca

You love it when I shake my little bon-bon

Bad bitch, coming through latest designs

Ass so phat that it look like I got long johns on
You wanna palm it right, cause it's soft and tight
Cause it look and it feel like Charmin' right
That bitch so scandalous
SOS you know you can't handle this
F-O-X B-R-O-W-N
Do y'all realize what kind of trouble you in?
Make you spend everything you make custom the link
On the S-five while I shake the backside
In my whip I hit the gas alone
Real chicks come on
Show love at the club when you shake your thong come on
