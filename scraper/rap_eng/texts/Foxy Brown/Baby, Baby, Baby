[Intro: Mase (Pretty Boy)]
You don't stop...we don't stop
(Can I rock this track?)
Is Fox on this track?
(Foxy Brown: Is Mase in the back with the lala stacks?)

[Verse 1: Pretty Boy]
I'm that pretty cat
Pockets thick, plus my whole city phat
Asked you nicely, disagree? It's like gimme that
Rock shows you wit the buggy
Gotta cop those, pop mose
Everything on top I drop those
Cromed out, suppose you not
Then it's not those
Rock gold, bigger than life
Make your block fold
All malicious, never personal
It's business
Heading for the green
Everybody gots their wishes
Pretty boy too swift
You ain't with Fox
Who you wit
Make you sick
Plus we don't give a shit
Please do, cherry red
Regal in the summertime
Supple down
I'm tore down
Plus it's Hummer time
Bad with the baddest
Don Pooh status
Tell me any label that wouldn't love to have this

[Chorus x2]
Baby, baby, baby
Oh you drive me crazy
All I see is all my doe
Always seem to go to hoes

[Verse 2: Mase]
Yo, how you expect me to respect you
When you in the club looking sexual
Doin' things my ex do
Know I peeped ya
All you do is smoke refer
Everytime gold teeth blowing up my beeper
I'm a be the king
Have my only queen
On the beach, g-string
Let a nigga see things
We ain't together
Worried bout who seein' my chedder
You never go see what i'm doin'
You worried about who i'm screwin'
Thought you dissed me
You got dissed in the end
Now I'm twistin' your friends
Drivin' the biggest benz
Since the day I left
Always stayed in debt
Then you got to save a check
Just to get an Avirex
Through it all
I'm a still go to the mall
Trick on another trick
Show you I don't love you, trick

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3: Pretty Boy]
When you saw the Benz
Bet you thought it was my friend's
Thought the hazel eyes was the contact lens
Thought the duplex was rented, and you meant it
Now you know it's mine
You gon' let me run up in it?

[Foxy Brown]
What you know about ballin'?
True shot callin'?
Nigga, what you haulin'?
I stay world tourin'
Tellin' all your mans how you scorin'
Cristal drippin' out the pussy
Straight pourin', you borin'
See a baller and I'm on it, we on it
Throw a little g and I lays it right on it

[Pretty Boy]
We can drink cristal all night and get busy
Have ya hee-hee-hee-hee-howin' like Missy
Who is he? Pretty, a.k.a. Nino Brown
Rock every show, gotta hoe, every town

[Foxy Brown]
Shit, I'm not a cheap bitch
Gotta spend Gs just to get between this
And i don't kiss the shit (nasty girl)
See you fuckin' with a rebel
Movado, bitches, I'm a Daytona ice bezel
You ain't never seen no game like this
Name like this, say my shit save my shit
Even if its 3's, mutha fucka please
Gotta get on his knees, Hit him for that cheese
Thought you had him under pressure too
Nigga, I done bagged him, I choose to fuck you
I love niggas, thug niggas
Shy niggas, I'll be good to ya
Player ask jigga

[Chorus 2x]
