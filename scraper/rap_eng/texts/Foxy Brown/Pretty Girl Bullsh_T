And I know I'm a good man
God, I wash my hands, make another plan
'Cos I don't really wanna stay, baby

'Cos I don't want no more of your pretty girl bulls
If you wanna leave, it's okay with me
Matter of fact, I'm begging please
Take your pretty girl, bull
Now this is number two, them chance I gave to you
You said, "It was the end" but here we go again
I thought I was a friend, not just another man
While holding hands, you don't understand
And I don't really get you, baby
What's the reason you want me
Girl, the truth is you need me
First you say that you trust me
Then you go and betray me
Now I took all I can
