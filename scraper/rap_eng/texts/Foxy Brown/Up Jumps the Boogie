[Hook 1]
Yo
Aye yo
Up jumps the boogie and clap ya hands to it
Hit the dance floor, now watch how fox do it
Up jumps the boogie and clap ya hands to it
Hit the dance floor, now through ya back to it

[Verse 1]
Pass the gleco, baby get it poppin
You know when Fox come in the club, the show stoppin
Ya see Gav at the bar hoe hoppin
Fox 5 guys in the club, with a fresh white tee
Crist poppin to B.I.G
I got my goons in this muh-fucka
Pissy then a muh-fucka
I'm B.K. til I d-i-e (eeh eeh)
That's my word, bitches mad at me
'cause I won't get on a song with 'em
Ain't perform with 'em
My bread stands on 'em
Keeps all mad
Esta loafer with velour bag
I got the Fox Brown fur, with the velour tag
And I don't drive 6 quarters, been gave it to Gav
Let me ask y'all haters this, why y'all mad at Gav
Because y'all see the young homie in the Mingle Jag

[Hook 2]
Aye yo
Up jumps the boogie and clap ya hands to it
Hit the dance floor, now watch how fox do it
Machine gun kelly with the foe foe mag
Fox comin through with a couple of goonie-goons
Up jumps the boogie and clap ya hands to it
Hit the dance floor, now through ya back to it

[Verse 2]
