(Intro)
Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go

(Verse 1)
I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

(Hook)
I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

(Verse 2)
Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back

(Hook)

I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you baby
I can't stop

(Bridge)
I stay cause I love you but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go that's why you treat me this way
I want to be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back

Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!

(Hook)(x2)
