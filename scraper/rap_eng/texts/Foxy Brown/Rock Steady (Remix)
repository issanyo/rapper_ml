Rock Steady
Steady on the floor
Stop stressin'
Let your worries go (stop stressin')
Rock Steady
Everyone has a part, It's not even hard
Everybody wants to party (whoo!)

(Verse 1) Mary J. Blige

Showcase, when you step in (That's right)
You can come, and bring a friend
Y'all drink, and enjoy yourselves
But go slow, don't hurt yourself
Relax, and socialize
And don't worry about no damn fights (Ha Ha!)
Be tight and keep it live
And hold your head up high! (Party people!)

(Repeat Hook 2x)

Range Rover, Bitch quick to pull over
Jump a hoe, Make 'em wish they had 4-leaf-clover (Uh)
This shit ain't over (Uh)

Barbie ain't fuckin' wit' me, and plus the broad older (Yeah)
I thought I told ya, Fox won't stop

Conceitedness, it's in me, but y'all ain't gotta excuse shit
Spray each nigga you laid with, then I'd clap you, bitch
