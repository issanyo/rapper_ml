Ugh, ugh, oh shit!
Oh my God, this shit hurts!
What is it? What is it?
Oh, it's girl! It's a girl! It's a girl!
(Coffy...)

Oh, let me hold my baby
You know, they didn't fuck messed up now
I mean, I finally got my Chyna Doll
What? A little Foxy!
You know Foxy, mama's been puttin' down in these streets
For many many many years
I done run with the baddest niggas out here
What? I mean, I own the hookers
I mean, I own the pimps
I mean, the streets was mine
But I got you, Chyna Doll and now the streets is yours
I want you to get out there and make your mama proud
But remember, only one person can judge you
So baby, live your life and go out there and be like a gangster
