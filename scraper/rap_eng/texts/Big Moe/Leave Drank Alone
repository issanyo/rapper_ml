(*talking*)
You know I'm talkin bout, everybody here
Trying to get outta something, you know I'm saying
But we ain't perfect though, so judge me
Like you judge yourself, you know I'm saying leave me alone

[Hook: Big Moe & Mike Wislon - 2x]
Trying to leave drank alone (leave drank alone)
I'm trying to leave drank alone (trying to leave drank alone)

[Big Moe]
It's the Big Moe the Barre Baby, and I want to
Say thank you, to all my fans and friends
For helping me through, what I been through
Lately thangs been crazy, but it's all good
I'mma stay on my knees, and pray for every
Ghetto and, every hood
Nobody's perfect, not by a long shot
The problems I got, I know we all got
I never give up, when times get hard
Keep my head up, and keep my faith in God yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Big Moe ain't no role model, I'm only human
It's a shame, how the world be judging us
For thangs that, we be doing
Now I know, that I'm getting older
And it seems, the world is so much colder
And success, put stress on my shoulder
Now I'm pouring less, in my soda
Man I miss, them days of being young
Big sipping big pimping, having fun
But nobody sip more, than the Moe
When you see me flip, Moe-Yo gotta go yeah

[Hook - 2x]

[Big Moe]
Now I'm realizing, I'm about to lose
Till I woke up to bad news so sad
I had to lose my patna Screw
Big Moe just ain't sanging, what I ain't gon do
What I'mma sang about, all the things
That I know, my niggas go through
From the right, I'm just living my life
Trying to play these cards, I'm dealt with a right
We all struggle, and going through thangs
But I know, it's just growing pains
What they say, Big Moe ain't gon sip
Getting week five for dip, but I do know this
I'm slowing down, take it one day at a time

Staying on my grind, trying to get mine
Trying to leave it alone yeah, trying to leave it alone
Trying to leave it alone yeah, trying to leave it alone yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm try-i-ing, trying to leave this drank alone

[Hook - 2x]
