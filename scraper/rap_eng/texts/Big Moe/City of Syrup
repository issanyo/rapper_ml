[Verse 1: Z-Ro]
Well it ain’t no plex with the East and the West
It’s plenty drank for your kidneys and plenty weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home ‘cause we ain’t tryna go to war
The common denominator in the situation is barre
Like a star you could shine with me, roll on 20’s and smoke pine with me
Come on and try to lift your mind with me
Steady be celebrating from paying our dues
Put so much drank in my cup, the soda water don’t even move
I’s a player, can’t associate with the plexing
Bone hard, Ridgemont, Mo City, Texan
A veteran, don’t get me wrong 'cause I’m quick to blast
Rather pour you a glass instead of beating on your ass
Take a chill pill Bill, blow some kill, pop the seal
Since we one big city, it’s every sid for live
From the dirty third coast, it ain’t no roaching, G
Just fill your flow up to the brim and have a toast with me

[Hook]
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
Big Moe done stepped in, Big Moe done stepped in
I done knocked out twins, I done knocked out twins
Moe-yo comin down I'm throwed
Ballin' outta control; it's Big Moe
I'mma let you know, I'mma let you know
I done let the po 4, I done let the po 4
Can't nobody sip more than Moe, yo
It's Big Moe drank baby
I done came down, I done came down
Up out H-Town, up out H-Town
And you know I'm throwed a G
The M-O-E cocked up on three
I'm comin down through in my day
Moe, yo, Screw, yeah
Moe comin down made that candy wet
Moe, yo
Said-a Moe, Big Moe ridin down on chrome
Y2K with my headlights on
Crossin threw the yellowstone
Bout to scoop me a yellowbone
Po six and my stop one
Time for me to pay my phone
Haters better leave Moe alone
In other words just sing the song

[Hook]
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw

[Verse 3: Tyte Eyez]
In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
Still come up substance make them hit the floor
84's and vouls with the freshes on my lows
Specialy on the fours doors
Bump the strape againts rows
Flosh low concert looking like a lumber yard
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some cacs
Cadillacs and six packs and gats bangin screw
Click click clack, get yor wimp ass threw
Payin dues and stayin tru is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw it won't change for nothin

[Hook]
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In my dirty-third, city of syrup
Bang Screw
