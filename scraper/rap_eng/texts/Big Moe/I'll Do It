[Intro: Lil' O]
Say girl, I'm just here to let you know whatever you need
I got you, youknowI'msaying
And that ain't because I'm a trick
That's just because through all the hard times you stayed down for a player
You know I'm saying, so I got to respect you for the queen you are
You know I'm saying, and I'ma treat you like a shining star
That's for real, coming from Lil' O

[Verse 1: Lil' O]
I'm thinking about the hard times I had boo
Like when I had to borrow change I had to ask you
See when a player had nothing I still had you
And you stayed down and it wasn't cause you had to
That's why I'm glad to, buy you things like diamond rings
Take you to the market to design your jeans
Expose your whole world to the finer things
Or put you in a drop benz sticky lime green
And that's all because you ain't do no popping
Girls hate you like bad food I got this bar rocking
But fuck them broads tell them we goin shopping
And when they see you 'sachi'd down, don't start jocking
See when I was down, where was my pals
They didn't come around it was me and my gal
That's why I don't hang it cats, niggas play it foul
But for you, I'll do anything just ask, that's my style

[Hook: Lil' O (Big Moe)]
So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)
Since you stood through the rain (I'll do it)
And baby money ain't a thang (I'll do it)
So if you need your rent paid (I'll do it)
Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You wanna chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
When the going got tough, you got tough with me
Through the thick and thin you stuck with me
And even though we're not living in luxury
Stay bubbled a player to come up with me
And I remember all my days in jail
Running my business from outside my cell
Look in my kitchen and try to use my scale
You even caught a case trying to make my bail
I don't want another woman cause you're all I need
When I post up my script you break down in greed
And I always appreciate your love
You even let me run the streets with my thugs
Even went to hit the streets with my drugs
Penitentiary chances, anything you need
Baby I can provide, all of these circumstances

[Hook]
Since you was there throuh the pain (I'll do it)

Need your wardrobe laid (I'll do it)
You wanna chill all day (I'll do it)
All you got to do is say it and (I'll do it)

[Verse 3: Dirty $]
From the start you were my one trusted, much repect
It's amazing how we connect, I'd be a fool to neglect you
I'd do whatever it takes to protect you
If you ever need me call and I'll be there in a sec., boo
When I was flat on my ass you gave me your last
When your people talk trash, you take it in stride
And just reply with a laugh, this hater on enhanced
Still thinking that a player spitting game trying to stab
Trying to slam couldn't create demonstrate between you and me
Now my glass half full no longer half empty
Boys envy, chicks just might tempt me
But I see, his and her plates on bentleys and jewels
In our future, tell me baby boo does this prada suit you
Then pack your shoe, till the virign not last
Anything you want, I'll do it cause of the past

[Hook]
So if you ever need some change (I'll do it)

[Outro: Big Moe]
I'll do anything, you want me to do, yeah
I'll do, I'll do, I'll do anything
I'll do anything, you want me to do, yeah
I'll do, I'll do, I'll do anything
