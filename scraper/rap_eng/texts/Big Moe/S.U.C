[Chorus]
Ohh, yeah, believe that
Yeah, I done hoped I'd speak to you
Screwed Up Click, my clique of G's
Ahh you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Noke, rolling with the Noke D
Get up out the way, for the H-A-W-K

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw ante up the stake
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, why? it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then I only make myself fatter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing, screaming S.U.C
And that's a screwed up Mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread, not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

[Chorus]
Screwed Up Click, my clique of G's
Ahh you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with my clique, it's the S.U.C
And they call me the Barre Baby

[Big Moe]
See when we floss our candy rides
Screens keep falling from the sky
Players ball and we stay true
And if you want to test my clique
I pop problems what you get
S.U.C. and we goddamn fools
We got that purple sticky dank
Chased with purple sticky drank
And forever we gon' bang screw
Oh it's the screw in us, we gone represent with pride
It's the screw in us till we die

[Chorus]
Screwed Up Click, my clique of G's
Ahh you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Po, rolling with the Pokey
Can't forget about, the Lil' Keke

[Lil' Keke]
Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C
Showing and blowing up since the year 93'
Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, 'cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man Southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a clique full of G's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreckshop, come on

[Chorus]
Screwed Up Click, gon' keep it true
R.I.P. to, that DJ Screw
We gone mourn you till we join you
And I want to say to you, without you fool
