(Chorus - 2x)
Dime piece, that's what she is
Sexy sexy, sexy sexy

(Big Moe)
Fell up in the club nigga see this cutie pie
See what's going down on a Friday night
I was on a drink so a nigga feeling fine
She was over there giving up the freaky eye
Stepped to her, with the drink in my hand
Do you have a man, or do you have a girlfriend
You never know, you might be creeping
So what you think little mama you and I
I know you heard this once too many times
So what you sipping on, little Chardiney
Can I but you another drink if it's okay
(every little city I go) everybody know my name Big Moe
(you looking good head to toe)
You a dime piece baby fa sho

(Chorus - 2x)
(Big Moe)
Fell up in the club once again the next night
(What you was blowing Moe-Yo man)
Tripping on the X or jar so tight
I wish that I would of hit the light
(bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling)
She was the finest broad in the club that night
(she was like music)

(Tyte Eyez)
Baby you must be from Tennessee
Cause you the only ten, that I see
A straight up, dime piece from your head to your feet
A nigga can't help or put you in the diamonds on me
We at the bar buying drinks I'm really digging your style
Small waist, bow legged straight white pearly smile
It'll only be a while 'fore I'm getting your digits
Best believe everytime you see me, a dime with me c'mon

(Chorus - 2x)
(Isis Re)
Even though you checking me
I've been checking you too
So don't cross the law, you a dime fa sho
Baby, you so fine, so fine, so fine

(Big Moe)
Baby you a dime, a dime, a dime
(sexy, sexy)

(Chorus)
Dime piece, that's what she is

(Isis Re)
Don't cross the law, you a dime fa sho

(Chorus)
Dime piece, that's what she is

(Isis Re)
Even though you checking me
I've been checking you too
So don't cross the law
You a dime fa sho, Big Moe
