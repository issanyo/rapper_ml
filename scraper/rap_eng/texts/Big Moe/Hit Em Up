All my playas in the house, won't you go on get em up
If you stacking to the ceiling, won't you go on hit em up
(all my G's in the place, sipping throw your cups up
If you bringing like you singing baby, throw your Rolley's up)
Now all the ladies in the house, won't you go on back it up
If you hit licks breaking tricks, go on get em up
(for my hustlers on the grind, you gotta go on throw it up
And for my women getting paper, let me see you show up)

[Mike D]
Po' some'ing roll some'ing, it's on my ni'
I plan to leave this thang tonight, with a jazzy figga
Some'ing thoed and tall, hop in the Benz and floss
Fish gutting out the lot, doing ninety to the spot
You see the ice nigga, when we step through the do'
I see you working that mosquito, back it up on the flo'
You make a playa wan' boogie, scuff up his Gucci boots
But I play the wall, and let you know I'm peeping you
Tow away and act it right, and bring me back the number
I know your game lil' mama, plus you working with some'ing
See a playa can't hang, in the club too long
Shoot through snatch some cot, hit the do' and it's on
Straight to the room, with a fat sweet to the dome
Let the headboard knock, while you scream Corleone
I'm trying to stretch you like a besser, keep that ass pent up
Baby this one for the hood, while I hit that thang up

[Big Moe]
The Southside Playaz, will tear this mother up
When we step into the party, ladies back that thang up
All my playas in this place, go 'head and throw your cups up
If you bringing like you singing, let me see you hit em up

[Mr. 3-2]
Now go on shake go on break it, for the G-O-V
Bounce that thang for daddy, and the S.U.C
We D-I-P, in the club getting gone
All the jazzy broads choosing, so I'm taking some'ing home
Now get wired up, and get fired up
Everybody, let me see you throw your side up
Hit em up hit em up, baby on the dance flo'
And put your cups in the sky, if you bout your papo'
From the back to the front, it's crunk with no plexing
Worldwide Southside Playaz, and we wrecking
Doing it like veterans, going live on stage
2000, and they let Corleone out the cage

[Hook]

[H.A.W.K.]
All my playas, throw your Rolley's in the air
All my hoes, go on shake your derriere
Mike D, G-O-V do you like what you see
If my boys don't like her, she must be ugly
Niggas mean mugging me, when I hit the scene
With a full cup of lean, creased Iceberg jeans
Bezeltyne bling-bling, broads on ding-a-ling
When they see the 600, with the falling screens
If you know what I mean, hit em up hit em up
You about your cream, girl strut your stuff
Now shake that butt, playas throw your sets up
Cause the H-A-W-K, bout to tear this mother up

[Big Moe]
The Southside Playaz, will tear this mother up
When we step into the party, ladies back that thang up
All my playas in this place, go 'head and throw your cups up
If you bringing like you singing, let me see you hit em up

[Hook]
