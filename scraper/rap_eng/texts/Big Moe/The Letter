(Big Moe talking)
KnowI'mtalkingbout, trying to get these on paper ma, let you know
I'm out here trying to make it happen for me and you baby, feel me

(Chorus)
Baby girl I'm sending this letter to you
Just to let you know you're still my baby boo

[Big Moe]
Lately I've been on the road
Can't say when I'm coming home
In and out the studio
That's the way the business go
Dealing with these bitches and niggas you never know
How this shit would end up like would end up after the show
By the way you smoke without a day
Got caught up on the highway
The cops tried to take me away
They weren't trying to hear what I had to say
I said these cops wouldn't let him go, we don't move no snow
I don't see what they see reason takes, my new tour
Search for us, never let us go
Cause he didn't find what he was looking for
Situation could of gotten out of control
But we made it through now it's time to roll
State to state to state we make so much of this hate
It's always strange to see what jealousy can create

[Enjoli]
Say boo you know it's real if you don't come home
When I call your phone ain't no plex in my tone
Hold this shit down leave your plex at home
Ain't bugging ain't tripping put you in the sex zone
When you hit the streets I know you giving them hell
Hit the studio make your pockets swell
Nigga knock but don't stop baby go on and mash
I'm down with my nigga we gone forever last
You chose me I chose you I ain't worried about no hoes
Got my name in your mouth don't let your mouth fall low
To a diamond baby, now go on and shine
I be here I'm you not so uh, smile for me now

(talking)
KnowI'msaying boo, I ain't really tripping on you
Just keep it real with me, you a real nigga and all
So I could wait for you to come home
I know you remember that I wonder
Let me hit you right back with another one

(Big Moe)
One more - 11x

[Big Moe]
I'm gone mourn my partner Screw, to let y'all know
That I miss your touch on me, take you as a fool

(Big Moe talking)
I know y'all miss someone out there man knowI'msyaing
Close might as well reminisce, can't stay putting it down man
Ain't nothing but music man, got to stack that, knowI'msaying
Representing for that South, Southside my, my side
Making sure you know Mo-Yo got my pride
