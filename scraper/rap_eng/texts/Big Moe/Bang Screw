[Z-Ro]
Well it ain't no plex with the East and the West
And plenty drank for your kin and plenty of weed for your chest
So leave your pistol at home cause we ain't tryin to go to war
The common denominator in the situation is bar
Like a star You can shine with me
Roll on 20's and smoke pine with me
C'mon and try to ease your mind with me
Stady be celebratin, for payin our dues
So much drank in my cup cause the sodawater won't even move
I's a playa - and associate with the plexin
Bone hard Ridgemont, Mo City, Texas
A veteran don't get me wrong cause Im quick to blast
Rather pour you a glass instead of beatin on your ass!!
Take a chill pill pill
Blow some kill, pop the steal
Since we won't be seen
Sippin syrup from police
From the thirty-third coast it ain't no roachin
Just fill your cup up to the brim and have a toast to this

(Chorus: repeat 2X)
All I wanna do, is bang screw
In the dirty-third, the city of syrup, bangin screw)

[Big Moe]
Big Moe Done stepped in (2X)
I done knocked out twins (2X)
Moe-yo comin down im Throwed
Ballin out of control is Big Moe
I'ma let you know (2X)
I done let the the potent flo (2X)
Can't nobody sip mo than moe-yo
It's Big Moe drank baby
I done came down (2X)
Up out H-town (2X)
And you know im a g
The M-O-E cocked up on three
I'm comin down Screw in my deck moe-yooooo
Screwwwoooyeah
Moe comin down made that candy wet moe-yoooo
Said a moeoooo
Big moe ride down the 4
Y2K with my headlights on
Crossin threw the yellowstone
Bout to scoop me a yellowbone
Po sex to my stop one
Time for me to play my song
And they better leave moe alone
In others words just sing the song

Chorus

[Tight Eyez]
In the city of syrup we like to jam music slow
Still come up with substance to make them hit the floor
84's and vogues with the freshest on my lows
Specialy on the 4 doors
Bumpers scrape against the road
Flosh low, concert, looking like a lumber yard
Waving my trunk up and down the boulevard
Charge the platinum card and the Visa to the max!!!
Still won't get no sleep till my click see some stacks
Cadillacs and six packs we guys bangin screw
Click click clack clack, get your wimp ass threw
Payin dues and styin true is the rule of the game
On top of the food chains
Bangin screw and it won't change for nothin

Chorus 4X
