(*Big Moe & Mike singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
One puff two puffs, I'm hooked like handcuffs
A thrush and a head rush, says that I've had enough
I'm sprung hear it comes, down a pathway through my lungs
A cloud of cluddered smoke, blends with my oxygen
The one human being, can't give me this satisfaction
Your centrifugal force, causes a chain reaction
The strategy you use, is addictive to many
One of you is not enough, I need five or twenty
I smoke plenty, menage tois with cigars
Wrapping weed like cigars, puts my mind on bars
Cut it down the middle, split it like the Red Sea
Show love filled with buds, fresh off the ganja tree
I'm on optimoes, force feeding you these flows
The aroma of marijuana, hits like Tyson blows
Boat loads of do-do, I'm in Akapoko
Tooty and fool coo-coo, but I'm going loco I'm blowed

[Hook: Breeze]
Just roll up a blunt, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, 24/7 3-65
Roll up a blunt yeah, and you know we gonna get high
Some killa weed, just to keep you satisfied

[Big Pokey]
Dump me in and close the do', let's take some pressure off ya brain
We three deep up on this thang, me and you and Mary Jane
From a bud to a grain, propane to a flame
Inhaling this octane, getting wet from all this rain
Everything is everything, I'm a certified choker
Light green smoker, put the heat to the ocra
Drop the three in the Fruitopia, we on cruise control
Or take 'em straight to the dome, cause it sooths the soul
I'm a puff-puff passer, doja square crasher
Getting my high to the sky, like a rocket out of NASA
Like players with asthma, bronchitis and ecetra
As for me I'm a tree, till you see red in my retna
Gone off Long and-a, this fire I'm loving
Massive puffing, chiefing smoking like a broke oven
Plus this sack I'm juggling, got us high as a kite
Cigarella's full of flight, what a hell of a night it's going down

[Hook]

(*singing*)

[H.A.W.K.]
Everything's splendid, the weed is heavenly scented
Puff-puff pass, is highly recommended
Till massage the brain, relieve migranes
And keep Sensei calm, when he's off the chain
You must maintain, and try to keep your composure
Whether hydro or cess, or some potent doja
Let me expose ya, to the pride of the front
Empty out the cigars, and just roll up a blunt roll it

[Hook]
