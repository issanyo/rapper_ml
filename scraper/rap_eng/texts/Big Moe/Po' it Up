[Verse 1: Big H.A.W.K.]
While I'm smokin' and leanin
Hatas plottin' and schemin'
None sippas be fiendin' like a vagina for semen
Do you know the feelin'
Of how it feels to lean
Now don't cough syrup
Or barre promethazine
Wit some sticky green
And po' up an eight
In a Orange Sunkist
Or a Welch's Grape
Sip the skee taste
Hit the blunts ya rolled up
And grab a firm grip of dat hundred dolla cup
Maan hold up
Share some wit ya buddies
Don't hit Big Moe cous
Cause it's too muddy
Big Red lookin' bloody like a blood transfusion
And too much drank can cause an illusion
Make ya knees get weak
And ya eyes get hazy
And ya mouth wide open now ya lookin' crazy
Drank makes ya laazzyyy
Jus ask the Barre Baby
He still stand tall wit a vigilate
Po' it up

[Verse 2: Big Moe]
Well I woke up
Ready this mornin'
Still throwed from the night befo' a playa was a young'n
I got out of my bed peeped out of my window
I see my partna fulla tray
Smokin' on hay
That's the way it go when we ballin' parlay
So I got up and I hopped in the shower
Ya know a big dude like to smell good
So I took about an hour
A wit da cherry out da say
Got a playa bald fade
That's the way it go when a playa stay paid
Threw on a crease
Wit a platinum piece
Befo' I hit the sweets gotta grab my PT

Sticky green and promethazine
For da' dough we broke the beam
A nigga be swervin' in and out the lane
Fightin' sleep
Wit a two-liter ah Big Red
Stayin' nin time like sweet
One deep up in a Maserati
Cause friends turn fake
I be solo when I po' up and I mix and I shake
Then I'm headed for the Tray to holla at Moe
I done bought an eight, and drank an eight- and
Lookin' to get some mo'. Wit da Drank Baby
It ain't no if's, and's, probably or maybe
It's fo sho we gone be leanin' on a regular by the daily
Brace yourself, wreck faces and swallow skee tastes
While I'm sleepin' plenty places talkin' like I jus got braces
Neva be catchin' cases cause I stays on my toes
I got a partna named Big Gup and ya know he got my fo'
We be sippin and smokin' in an attempt to stay high
With a lotta staple for my swishas cause I gotta stay fly
