He's back...

[Big Moe]
Now I know all ya'll done heard of me
I'm still the M-O-E, the (barre baby)
I'm on my second c.d. and I'm nation wide
I still throw it up wide, represent the Southside
Still, 3rd Ward vetran, still squashing plexing
Out the Houston Texas, gators no less and
Still, sitting on chrome I got a new flip phone
Two pints to the dome, Wreckshop is still my home
The Barre Baby has returned and the diamonds still show
I'm balling in the mall, got my new J's on
I got my screw tape on, I'm chunking a deuce up out the roof
It's going down in H-Town I thought you already knew, I'm still the...

[Hook]
Barre baby, baby, baby
It's the Barre Baby
The M-O-E from the S.U.C

[Ronetta Spencer]
If it's a Barre Baby oh on the radio so cute with the on so low
Check out my style won't you feel my flow
It's your baby girl that's seven years old
Giving it to you raw, my talent is natural
Inventourous trying to scraping escargot
My money more, impressing the hoes and great
Then I ? we known to get paid

[Big Moe]
It's the B to the I to the G to the M-O-E see that be me
If you look in my eyes, you'll see it's no surprise, that I got this S.U.C
The Barre Baby got to let the whole wide world know
Candy roll fast move tank crawl slow
A.C. blow pop trunk oh no, sit low po po want to know about Moe

[Hook - 2x]
