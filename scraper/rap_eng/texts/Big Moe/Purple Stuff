[Intro: Big Moe]
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side
Throw, yo' hands highhh - wave 'em side to side

[Big Moe]
Everybody clap yo' hands, and sing along wit me
It's Big Moe, da barre baby, representin these Southside streets
Now if you ain't heard of me then you don't know wassup
You can find me on them Screw CD's talkin about 'Purple Stuff'

[Hook]
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll) Purple stuff, purple stuff
Purple stuff! (Purrrr-pullll)

[Big Moe]
Now see it started back in seventy-fo', Teri gave life to Moe
See momma was a hustler, daddy was a buster, y'all know how that go
I was raised Screwed Up Texas, didn't know my direction
Now I'mma state representative, been chose by election
Some said I wouldn't make it, but I'm still in the game
Things done changed, diamond rangs;
Man it's funny how things done changed
I hooked up with that DJ Screw
He slowed it down, chop-chopped it too
Got blades on the bus, candy paint on the truck
If you wanna know what's in my cup..

[Hook] - 1/2

[D-Gotti]
Now.. now.. now..
That 'Purple Stuff', that Houston soda in my cup
Now I'm behind the wheel, catch the wood, I'm done
Under the influence of bar (?)
Drank stains on my FUBU and I still feel like a star
Now I'mma go up behind the wheel cause I done woke up
Wrapped around a pole and took a sip from my cup
Now I can't slip up, (?) clipper
Catch a playa leanin impa-uh, one up in the trunk
Now.. now hut, two, three to da fo'
I done slammed up the fo' wit a Crush Pineapple
Gotti gon' last long but I ain't sippin wit dat bowl
Drinkin at the bar baby I be way too throwed
And I guess a playa had about enough..

[Hook]

[Repeat Intro, mingle with Hook and ad libs]
