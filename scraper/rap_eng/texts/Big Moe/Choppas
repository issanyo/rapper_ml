[Intro: D-Gotti]
We Po'ed up,  we showed up
And we still rolling on choppas
It ain't stopping know what I'm talking about
It's D-goti, wreckshop to tha grave
It's going down, mo-yo, feel this here baby

[Verse 1: D-Gotti]
These blades are choppin'
And these babes are boppin'
Got a cup full of mud and my trunk is knockin'
Feeling my FUBU
Hollering what it do
Hitting circles throug the lot like im in a hula-hoop
Who the crew that stang these streets like bees
We the G's that be's and i'll flow from over seas
Hold the trees big moe while I split the optimo
In a wide body Benz-O going bout 4
Oh, the ex-o just hit me where it hurt
Im bout to jump down and flirt
And get up some skirts
Let the ice do the work
Put us up in the dentist
After we hit the lenards till they know who sent us
You can fuck
But your ass can't stay and drank drank
Next morning we hooked up eating breakfast at the Frank's
Doing the same thing we did the day before
Choppin the sceene and knocking down bad hoe's
