[Intro: D-Gotti]
We po'd up, we showed up
And we still rolling on choppas
It ain't stopping know what I'm talking about
It's D-Gotti, Wreck Shop to the grave
It's going down, Moe-yo, feel this here baby

[Verse 1: D-Gotti]
These blades are choppin'
And these babes are boppin'
Got a cup full of mud and my trunk is knockin'
Feeling my FUBU
Hollering what it do
Hitting circles through the lot like I'm in a hula-hoop
Who the crew that stang these streets like bees
We the G's that be's and i'll flow from over seas
Hold the trees Big Moe while I split the optimo
In a wide body Benz-O going bout 4
Oh, the ex-o just hit me where it hurt
Im bout to jump down and flirt
And get up some skirts
Let the ice do the work
Put us up in the dentist
After we hit the lenards till they know who sent us
You can fuck
But your ass can't stay and drank drank
Next morning we hooked up eating breakfast at the Frank's
Doing the same thing we did the day before
Choppin the sceene and knocking down bad hoe's

[Chorus]
Chop-pas
Rolling in my candy red car
Rolling on chop-pas
Sippin' a big daddy cup of barre
Chop-pas
I Gotta feel that Moe-yo
Crawling through these city streets
Sippin on a what straight 4
And we rollin

[Verse 2: Big M.O.E.]
Down south, we rolling nation wide
Popped up Moe-yo foreign ride
Put it down for that boy Po-yo
On the low low, I'm a young pro
In thie game I ain't lame
Rolling down on chops
Smoking on the killer Mary Jane
Coming down freestyle, playa' buck wild
Big M.O.E. is a throwed child
I'ma leave lean , stack my green
Every time you see the Moe I'm on the codeine
I'm out the damn tre, a playa' don't play
Bout to chop it up for them boys everyday
Choppas, rolling on those choppas
Cha-a-pas

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Noke-D]
Chop Chop, when I hit your block
I told you once before that the shit don't stop
Wreck shop to the grave trunk pop, make it say hey
Hello hi hey how ya doing
Put the Screw in your deck, throw up yo' set
And go break and your neck cause the 20 inches wet
And I bet that if we sip three whole eighths
Pop 1,2 a piece these hoes gone hate, MAN!!!!

[Verse 4: D-Wreck]
Wreck shop baby so playa' made
I'm a let the top down, let the sun hit the braids
I'm a bleed these blocks till' my heart beat stop
Keep the streets on lock, cause the shit be hot
D-Wreck tote Glocks, cause we tote big knots
Methazine on the rocks till' my belly pop
So clean when we shop, my car never stop
Candy gleam off the drop make your girl flip flop
D-wrezay tell me how ya feel
It's all about the scrill want a billon dollar deal
Noke-Deazy tell me how do ya feel
Some get it how they love it but we get it how we feel
D-Wreck, Noke-D handle business the same
We fuck hoes and sip 4's cause we running this thang
Some thangs never change they remain the same
P-A-T and E-S-G and M-O-E gone bang
