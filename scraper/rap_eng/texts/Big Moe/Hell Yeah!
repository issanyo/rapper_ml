Hell yeah Wreck a rider, Wall Street insider

Hell yeah I cheated, on both of the broads

She asked me was the rumor true, was I really over there
Looked her in her eyes and I told here, hell yeah
Hell yeah I'm a thug, hell yeah I do drugs
Hell yeah, you can catch me opening tulips in the club
Hell yeah Bush tripping, hell yeah I miss Clinton
In them days I bled the block, wrecked the shop and was winning
Hell yeah she wanna do me, just because she saw the movie
But I ain't gon lie, I love my boppers and my groupies
Hell yeah I'm a G, with a college degree

If a nigga disrespect me, or my family or my loot
Hell yeah I fucked your boo, fucked her in her dome too
Hell yeah I miss that P-A-T, that Mafio and Screw
Hell yeah I live lavage, pimping pens got me established
Hell yeah I got a stack of talents, touring while in Paris
Fool around coming down, smoking pounds in my Coupe
With your dime on my side, to setting up that berry blue
Hell yeah it's very true, that she did the whole crew
Hell yeah and we fucked her, all in the same room
