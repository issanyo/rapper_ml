Verse 1 [Big Moe]
Motorola big face folder bumping grinding just to get it
3rd Ward, Texas block I bled it to rescore thats where I'm head it
The streets is watching I'm not stopping cause my bills gone keep on stacking
My ears in love from singing and rapping I love the game
But want to know whats is my change
So change the ballin I'm not stallin
I rip down everybody Chorus state to state these hoes adore us
Give us your fedi to divide among us
The shop is wrecking count your blessing if you plexing you believe in
Another family bill of bleeding
So you better ride out

[Chorus] Big Moe 1x
Dedicated to the music trying to make some cash
Motherf**kers in the street gon feel my rhythem
Feeling like I hit the top at last
I'm still on my p's and q's
Should of known better than to let me shine
Boss hawging in the game for nothing but good rhythem
I stayed down with it now the cash is mine
But I have to pay my dues

Verse 2 [D-wreck] {Big Moe}
Yep and nope an drank and smokin thats when the plan was put together
Lets wreck the streets and the storm will weather
Our platinum plaques gon make us feel better
With so much money so much money {feel so good getting paid}
So much money so much money{try to f**k over me you get sprayed}
So much money so much money{you don't really wan't to f**k around}
So much money so much money{i can pay to have living under ground}

[Chorus]1x
Verse 3 Big Moe {D-wreck}
No longer local worldwide vocals I'm trying hard to make it gravy
Customized have you seen it lately around these parts they call me drank baby
Said I O.D. they don't know me we gon still smoking and leaning
Hustling hustling juggling creamin living my life as if I dreaming
{Please dont wake me Please don't wake}
Lord please let me sip until I drown
{Cause in reality life might break me}
So when its small world lord can I ball hey
Everyday I want fresh off the lot

Pull it out to get my screens install
Dedicated to the game i'ma shot call

(Chorus)2x
