Downtown from the hood
(Better) klack or get klacked on, (either) klack or get klacked on, (better) klack or get klacked on, (either) klack or get klacked on

[Verse 1: Phil Da Agony]
Black man, shoot your friendly neighborhood local policemen
Cause they'll say you got a gun, it's just cell in your hand
Police will shoot without proof or evidence or the truth
My nigga reached for registration, blew his brains through the roof
Which lead me to the conclusion that we should do the shooting
My itchy trigger finger niggers is a new resolution
What about Sean Bell and all the niggers in jail
That didn't really do the crime it just remind me of hell
To get locked like Mandela get respected
Or you can get rich like Roc-A-Fella off of records
Or you could shoot it out with the cops, make a body block
Take them on a high speed chase, hit the body shot
Change of place, when you shoot the pigs, aim for the stomach, hit the face
Rob a bank, hit the safe, get the cake, clack first
Youtube Micheal Moor fast words, studies show, cops see blacks and let the gats burst
Yeah, that's right motherfucker, you could Youtube that shit yourself
Build the agony Strong Arm Steady and I'm

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]
You hear that guitar but this ain't no rock band
I spit this because, because I'm a rock man
In my homeland it's hard to withstand
That's the beat (?) south east is contraband
Fire armed car, alarm in the back drop, yellow tape a fellow got scraped while his rats watched
We RS fellows mandatory down to a pistols but if you ain't toting a nigga will yank your chrystals
And I'm King Tuting just call me a ice flooding, Morgiado top flopping at the tap of a push button
More revenue than most niggers are still on the block
Maybe cause I got something to lose, they ask won't be shot
But once a real factor, always a klack klacker
Make carnage out of niggers that think they a change snatcher
City full of brain blasters, San Diego's filled with dead homies that some little nigga's named after
Don't get it fucked up nigga, just cause a nigga hopping out this V cord,
Don't mean a nigga won't splat you nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krodon]
Baptized with an appetite for warfare, stay in here you lift the 10 feet in the air, yeah
Homie see electric chair, cell block filled to the rim with
You keep letting the small things slide, you won't win, die or survive
Do your time, take it in stride
(?) niggers on the yard when it's fun time
The hood's evil know better than the Chinos what it's impact the ground zero
See heroes getting cut and ate like supiro
Leave them bleeding, guess I be needing David Chapiro
Be the reason they got wanted wetting the wierdo
(?)
I mean we like to preach whether blue make green, black and brown make green
But it's always gonna end up that way, so ya be prepared for everything
