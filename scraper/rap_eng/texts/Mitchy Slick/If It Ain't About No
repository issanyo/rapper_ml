[Verse 1: The Jacka]
I got the best weed Cali got
In the car with my son drivin' through the (?)
Headed to the Fed-Ex building bout to mail out a pack
If it wasn't for The Bay you niggas woulda neva thought of that
Everybody sellin' yae I'm bout to bring Water back
Never played in a game but my niggas call me quarterback
Glue Brees got the 2 liter full of Act
All my niggas in the streets never knew a nigga cool as Jack

[Hook: Mitchy Slick]
If it ain't about no dough, I probably ain't gon' go
If ain't about no hoes, I probably ain't gon' go
All my niggas all my niggas dead and gone or on parole
So I'm gonna stunt for 'em
Ride around in somethin' European on 4's

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
These rappers fake but I guess you niggas cool with that
Grew up picked a side then we had to go to school with straps
If you didn't ride then the nigg couldn't fool with Jack
Niggas think they live till you put the tool to they hat
Keep K's in the hood 'case they try cruise through the jects
Niggas in the hood snitching now I don't know who to trust
But I rep the Mob heavy cause nigga all we got is us
Nigga look around everybody jockin' us
Niggas act down then we show up and they not so tough
Only crime he ever done was pull a tag on his mattress off
These niggas just mad they out here extra soft
Dip to your pad and knock your dad's natural off nigga

[Hook]
If it ain't about no dough, I probably ain't gon' go
If ain't about no hoes, I probably ain't gon' go
All my niggas all my niggas dead and gone or on parole
So I'm gonna stunt for 'em
Ride around in somethin' European on 4's


[Verse 3: Lil Blood]

[Hook]
If it ain't about no dough, I probably ain't gon' go
If ain't about no hoes, I probably ain't gon' go
All my niggas all my niggas dead and gone or on parole
So I'm gonna stunt for 'em
Ride around in somethin' European on 4's
