[Intro: Mitchy Slick]
Aye Scoob, these niggas' better recognize, nigga
On everything I love, nigga
Just because I walk around in red bottoms
Don't mean I won't break they motherfucking jaw
Woop woop!

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Who that is rolling with us?
I be fucking on them bitches that you wish you could fuck
I be sipping on that liquor wish you had in your cup
Making moves, getting richer, now you want it with blood
Say what?
Who that is rolling with us?
I be fucking on them bitches that you wish you could fuck
I be sipping on that liquor wish you had in your cup
Making moves, getting richer, now you want it with blood
Say what?

[Verse 1: Mitchy Slick]
It ain't my fault the bitch say she ain't naughty
And was always available when a nigga would roll through
I knew there was some square ass nigga she would go to
And trick and do all the shit I would say no to
When you done all the shit it takes to make you a block legend
Bitches like your baby momma won't stop pressing
Throw away your whole relationship just to taste a sip
Be having her on crown, she never taste a crisp
Put a flick on her milkbox if she leave with Slick
By the time I hit the vallet, she was in my shit
Yeah, and your homies was there, but they ain't say nothing
Cause they know what's gonna rack at the store with the pump fakin'

[Hook: Big Scoob]

[Verse 2: Eight-0]
I beat the lane up somewhere when I'm crawling
E-40 posse on Broadway, big balling
It's how you see the cup
Half empty, half full
Never took orders from suckers, who gave these facts, you?
You know the Torus full, the poll did the Mac' dance
[?] I'm in my Mac' stance
Big Scoob, who fucking with blood?
Another dirty ass bitch who wants this drink in my cup
I'm a one-five villain that connected with the five-six
Y'all just immature gangsters, we really from the sticks
We really tapped in, streets to the dog house
Soft 20 on dog, who from the dog pound?

[Hook: Big Scoob]

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Who that is rolling with the Big Fella?
Villain nigga, 'bout the business not a fib teller
I been known to get it with it, I'm a night dweller
Throwing rocks at the pig, now the pig help ya'
Yeah, bitches love me, I'm a heart melter
K-9 by design, ghetto rock [?]
Have you niggas in positions where they can't help ya'
Have your body with the fishes where they can't smell ya'
Aye slow down, blood
If you looking at me wrong, it'll go down, blood
You a pussy feeling reckless, I'ma throw rounds, blood
If you thinking you can check it, have a go-round, blood
