If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 1: D-Lo]

Girl, all you got is pussy to give a nigga?
Dumb bitch, you ain't seeing the bigger picture
Haha!I'm on my big dog shit and if you ain't about no money you can't be my bitch
See, you got action, that satisfaction, my pimping is strong, bitch
But if I gotta hurt you, you gonna be on your own, bitch
I'm 'bout 50 toes down, bro, that's 5 hoes
And when I shoot I don't miss, I think I'm Dale Rose
I'm David Roughy, these bitches, they shoot without me
I fucked her without a penny, boy, that ain't like me
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
No regy, boy, I smoked the dopest reefer
Look, my weed loud, like Samuel L Jackson
I can multiply and divide these bitches like fractions
I'm a rude boy, I'm a cold nigga
I'm the reason these bitches call you they old nigga

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 2: Mitchy Slick]

She hit the Mandolin, Venetian, and Caesar's in one night
Retired at the crack of dawn till the gates racked her with no god
Never listened to her momma, never listened in school
So if you bet on her listening to ism, you a fool
The pea hunter I call her, all of Vegas know about her
She got hella victims in her bag, got pictures of them with powder
Residue on their nose while they're snoozing in their Polos
He ain't never had real snow so he fucked her to the sun rose
New to the desert, so we never knew vet hoes this cold
To keep frying toes to your asshole but won't give you no blow
Go out like the whole cake, fuck first, I can't screw it
You can tell every bitch at the service, your name's ruined
If I'd have known the business, now you fucked off
Two notes away from paying your rova truck off, now she done truck off
She could've kept that pussy, I'mma fuck who earn this, why I'm always swerving
This the new end journey

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]

She know I get it, I'm pitching about that trap
Niggas, they know it's Menace, I keep that bitch on my lap
Suckers, they love to hate but they never 'bout that paper
Niggas ain't really balling, they ain't playing with the Lakers
Trucking with real lovers, breaking it out with C-Lo
Fucking with bad bitches but keeping it on the d-lo
Step out, niggas love to run they mouth
Niggas come from the bottom 'cause I lead it from the south
I'm smoking on that shit, pimping on that bitch
Hopping off that lag and jumping in something sick
Sipping on that shit, I'm thinking with my mind on my dick
Baby, I'm a baller, not a trick'
She know that I'm rollin'
She see me, she want it
When I pull up, she on it
She know I'm running that corn

Tell me this

If I fuck you, can you keep it on the d-lo?
I can protect you, girl, I keep a desert eagle
I be smoking on nothing but loud, keisha cup

Girl, you think you slick, gonna get some dick
Would I handle your bizz, gimme D, here's a tree
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
I'm just on this lean, you act like you on Tina
