[Intro]
Them say no, and you come
That’s why you kill da king
King that he will fade away
But refresh everyday man
Now when it come to sum bizness
Its we that run the scene
Cause we fresh and green, come

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yeah, graveyard shift, meet the grim reaper
Sickle to your features, balance that like a Libra
Scale yeah I’m off that
Derailing all your thoughts on this track
All this wax I should make a candle fac-tory better
Glory all facts his-tory in the making, I am that
(Chea,Chea,Chea,Chea)
Victory is sweet enough to eat, bon appetite
Pull up a chair and eat
You buffoons couldn't walk in my shoes
If we were sharing feet

[Verse 2: Krondon]
Mind too cool, dominion can’t compare they just some glarin geeks
In real life, perpetrate like mike only a pair of sneaks
Level 3, skeeter tried to squack I didn't care to speak
Burgundy, polo went public I can’t prepare to teach
Smoking like Santonio Holmes
When the camera go flash, I get the feeling at home
Under the avalanche
Guess that’s how ghetto survival, syndrome fuck the system
A nigga woke up to get on screaming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, let me get my shit off
Grab me a bag of work now watch how fast that fucker get off
Yeah, have the money flipping in oz, go get up
Throw somethin hot in yo oven dawgs
Nigga, we motherfucking bout it bout it
Get rowdy, rowdy, I’m a ghetto dog
Go head inside it

[Verse 4: Phil Da Agony]
Yo, my niggas cry freedom like Nelson Mandela
Played by Morgan Freeman
I be walking with the giants like the G men
Hit the pussy like semen
Hood angels I be fighting demons I’m excited
At the chance just to get even
So I play the odds, pray to god
Poker face chips like I’m playing cards
My chick like Felicia Rashad in the face
Hale Berry waist with the grace of sade
I take her out just to party, everybody say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 5: Mitchy Slick]
Understood by those that blossom by MLK
Cocooned in a one bedroom, interjects, all in yay
Brainstorm philosophies on getting k’s and getting away
On gang injunction with the jail for nathen yesterday
Fuck the swines all they want is a cheaper nigga broke
Contradicting tycoons and the candy crips and cigarette
Porky gotta eat his heart When he see my super sport
What they done to my folks
I charge it to her pink toes

[Verse 6: Jay Rock]
They done fucked up and let this watts nigga get on
It’s my time to eat so I’m bout to get my grill on
George former ho, storm on the flow
Steady getting fetti, either rap guns will blow
Step inside this bitch they looking like wanna go toe to toe
These hands like pitbulls and now I let these fuckers go
So I think you need to let them motherfuckers know
These choppers leave they fucking heads spinning like some stop and go’s
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
