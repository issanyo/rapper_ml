[Intro]
Ey Bankz I tried to tell the young boy homie, you know... Shit we got more homies doin' life than we got out on the streets you know... It's triv down here in Southeast San Diego where I live homie, Logan Ave you know
*Clack clack clack clack* ey wassup Bankz

[Verse 1 - Mitchy Slick]
Rambunctious and energetic what I thought at first
But once I analyzed I realized you damn near the worst
Lil' homie from the turf, yea I knew you since birth but now the bad bitch thinkin you wana cross and get murked
Just for scrappin at the Gaslamp before the shootin'
You got it brackin in the turf, you the one recruitin'
Yo baby momma homegirl sent you to daddy, they was scrappin on the playground, your ex was happy
Got your granny pan high, then the Migos slid thru
If the homie wasn't on deck, you woulda died fool
What your daughter gon do without you alive fool?
The same trip she gon do if you get 20 to life fool

[Chorus - Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Put in work but don't work yourself
[Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Don't work yourself
[Repeat]

[Verse 2 - Celly Ru]
Slow down on the slider now cuz I'm the n*gga wit the money
Still a shooter and got shooters never call em crash dummies
Kill anybody over all the love they had for me
Takin' care of n*ggas in the pen before I had money
We was young n*ggas lonely, without the big homies
Misguided because the ones thats out ain't did sh*t for me
We been lost since Red Ru went to the pen on me
My generation started off with about me and ten homies
Now the numbers goin' up, because n*ggas showin' up
But most of these n*ggas wasn't around when we was growin' up
I ain't trippin' on em bruh - long as n*ggas showin love
I was puttin in the work, Now the hood blowin up

[Chorus - Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Put in work but don't work yourself
[Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Don't work yourself
[Repeat]


[Verse 3 - Sleepy D]
Game recognize game when you game bred
I put so much work in the streets and didn't game in
Street cred for me, came with so much pain shed
Heavy situations got me thankful that I ain't dead
Tryin to cope with tragedies, searching for a casualty
This can't be the life that the good Lord had for me
I reminisce the nights and all the moments that was bad for me
When a county meal was all a mufu**a had for me
I don't owe a nigga sh*t so why you mad at me
You can go and get that sh*t yourself so why you mad at Sleep
Slumlord of the town I guess I had to be
He ain't doin' sh*t out here if he ain't tapped with me
N*ggas jumpin' off the porch tryna be a boss
N*ggas they looked up to all they life they seen was really soft
Don't think you got me fooled with all that silly talk
Disrespectin' n*ggas round me will get you really off

[Chorus - Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Put in work but don't work yourself
[Einer Bankz]
I've been workin' I've been workin I've been workin
[Mitchy Slick]
Don't work yourself
[Repeat]
