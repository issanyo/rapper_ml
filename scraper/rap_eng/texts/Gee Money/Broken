[Intro: Azure The Paradox]
They say if it ain't broke dont fix it
If it ain't broke dont fix it
If it ain't broke dont fix it
If it ain't broke dont fix it
I've been missing
Its been missing
Here reminiscensing
Fix it

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Drowning in the peer pressure tryna catch the waves
I dont wanna be alone I dont wanna feel betrayed
Say the truth will set you free so I will be your slave
I been digging this grave since the sixth grade
I can never get over it it is more than a phase
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Just to tell you the truth I really wanna be your slave

[Verse 1: Minette Fourie]
How long have you been hiding
How long have you been hiding this
How long have you been hiding
How long have you been hiding this
How long have you been hiding
How long have you been hiding this
How long have you been fighting?

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Drowning in the peer pressure tryna catch the waves
I dont wanna be alone I dont wanna feel betrayed
Say the truth will set you free so I will be your slave
I been digging this grave since the sixth grade
I can never get over it it is more than a phase
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Just to tell you the truth I really wanna be your slave

[Verse 2: Azure The Paradox]
I've been broken I've been hoping for a chance
I ain't smoking on the potent not a trance
You be provoking me but when I take advance
Its right back to who left you I just dont understand
Is it all a lie, is it all a front
Said that I could be immortal I won't last a month
I've been trying to survive but there's demons to confront
Said that she would give me love but it was faker than a stunt
I should've known better
Now I stack my paper like a double decker
Ain't talking work but you better check her
She'll turn on you like a vinyl record
Man fuck love and fuck peace
Im chained up I was never free
She lied about what she told me
Now im on a quest to question beliefs
She got me tripping I ain't rolling up the trees
Buy my way into her life I can handle all the fees
I ain't talking about a movie with everything that I have seen
We popping pills in Ibiza only in my fucking dreams

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Drowning in the peer pressure tryna catch the waves
I dont wanna be alone I dont wanna feel betrayed
Say the truth will set you free so I will be your slave
I been digging this grave since the sixth grade
I can never get over it it is more than a phase
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Just to tell you the truth I really wanna be your slave

[Verse 3: Roane]
Walking to the corner I got tears in eyes
Got the holes in my pockets never feel I'll get it right
Imma snap on a beat getting pulled in by life
Got the facts in my heads, but won't live through the night
I won't give anything less than 20% or maybe 30% or maybe 50%
I don't know anymore! I'm capped out and cashed out
Cats getting milked like cash cows, for a couple thou
Never let a message get under my skin, my blood thick
Never let a message determine the way I love tricks
Never let a message confuse the people that possibly contemplate
The corruption of government economics
I'm an exception, lost locating direction
The cost of the consequences encompasses God's decisions
The constant calling of poverty, Property in monopoly
Lost in my own reality, wondering what keeps drawing me back in
I rap fast but think slow, life feeling sad bro, Oh no
Masking the pain and my heart broke, no hoes
Dope though, Livin searching for my purpose, where the worth though?
Know I'm powering through I'm hoping for radical change
Pennies in nuclear wells granting my wishes for days
And every second I'm spitting, I feel my life dissipate
But my intentions are pure, though I feel nobody relates
And now I'm lost, lost in my ways
Looking for a guide to clear the fog from my daze
Looking for a friend, cuz I'm tired of the games
Need a real straight shooter, no COD for the king
Cuz I made this choice, and I made this bed
And I'm broken, broke, and I got no bread
Fitna call these feds cuz Im feeling outta options
Bopping my head to the rhythm of my problems

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Drowning in the peer pressure tryna catch the waves
I dont wanna be alone I dont wanna feel betrayed
Say the truth will set you free so I will be your slave
I been digging this grave since the sixth grade
I can never get over it it is more than a phase
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Just to tell you the truth I really wanna be your slave

[Bridge: Azure The Paradox]
I've been broken I've been hoping for a chance
I've been broken I've been hoping for a chance
Fill the void with a thing of the past
Fill the void with a thing of the past
Tears in my eyes, you see me hurting
Avoid me like the plague, babe, why do I deserve this?
Now I write my curses in cursive
And stack these verses on verses
And put my heart into hearses
I guess I earned this

[Outro 1: Azure The Paradox]
I've been up for days tryna find the different ways
Drowning in the peer pressure wanna catch your waves
I dont wanna be alone I dont wanna feel betrayed
Say the truth will set you free I wanna be your slave
