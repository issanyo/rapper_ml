[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I just deal with the same pain
All my life with the same pain

[Verse 1: Azure The Paradox]
Yall never the stay in the same lane
Yall never feel this same pain
Got big dreams yall never knew my aim I
Did it for the fam dont give a fuck about the fame
Just making a name for me and my city
This that DMV and shit be getting gritty
Everybody rolling up and smoking like some chimneys
And everybody else out here ruining they kidneys
Drowning in drugs, yeah they going full Whitney
Passing Mary Jane until they grabbing on the Whiskey
Straight edge nigga not a lot of people with me
Theres a lot of hooligans tryna peer pressure me
Do it for the city and the homies they with me
Do it for the city and the homies they with me
Save my home, cuz we not alone
ATP Sincerely

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I just deal with the same pain
All my life with the same pain

[Verse 2: Joy2D]
Every little nigga that I met is being basic
Playing Drake on spotify like he's on every playlist
Even my lil homie tryna hop up on the list
But he never gave some thought to the game that he would be playing
Tryna catch some money just to make a small investment
Busting caps and thinking they ain't gonna be arrested
Screaming life is hard, but they don't want an education
Kicking some dirt as pixie dust for death wishes
I ain't tryna call nobody dumb cause we just kings and queens
Hoping for a chance to rise up and have everybody see
The illest, who ever did it
Forget the predecessors
Gone in a minute just because they never helped the business

[Verse 3: Azure The Paradox]
Real friends stay and the fake fade away
All these games yall still had to play
Made me cold hearted like O'Shea
And my whole town going cray
Will we live to see the end of the day
Will we still die if we just pray
Look to the skies no longer day
Kill me now nigga I won't fade

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
I just deal with the same pain
All my life with the same pain
