[Hook]
Renegade your life
Renegade mine too
No matter how hard I try
You still need proof
Renegade your life
Renegade mine too
No matter how hard I try
You still need proof

[Verse]
Sky high no limits
Fly guys so wicked
Shy guys too timid
Just fucking up your image
No pools still swimming
80s shit so vintage
Rest in Peace Eazy he
Ten deep in women
We never really die
New homes the sky
You can't be satisfied
Seppuku like Samurai
This is my war cry
Promise that I terrify
Young niggas get hypnotized
Shift shift that paradigm
Hang Hang that's suicide
Hang Hang no suicide
Trap Trap like parasites
Leave all of you Paralyzed
This is my sacrifice
Analyze and Verify
This world will be purified
Remade by my design

[Hook]
Renegade your life
Renegade mine too
No matter how hard I try
You still need proof
Renegade your life
Renegade mine too
No matter how hard I try
You still need proof

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Renegade with no Upgrade
Fuck Lemonade Im colder than O'Shea
Touche'? death note im finna delete
Know its me fuck being discrete
Remembering me before me
And me before This
Way back then i was schooling these kids
Blade in my hand
But not cutting a wrist
Aim at the bully and hope I dont miss
Pick it back up and trying again
Trying again he's lying again
Wanna hurt him for hurting my friends
And hes harming me. He's starting shit
Alarming the teachers being a snitch
And if I could see the fucker right now
Making sure he's having no kids
Hang hang you suicide
Hang Hang I'll join you
Kill the homie that Homicide
Better hope I don't find you
Real talk never killed nobody
Real talk never sold a bag
I ain't never catch a fucking body
Or put the remains in a damn bag
But real shit I did get bullied
And heart breaks on the worse days
Never pulled up with the black hoody
Never held an AK
But if I did, that nigga dead
That nigga dead those niggas dead
I never want to fit in
Fuck status quo quote that shit
