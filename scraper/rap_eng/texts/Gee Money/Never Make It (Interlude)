[Verse: Draco]
Every less I do
Each are the shots
If I remember to call it off
Then there is only the reason why
Guess I'd never see it eye to eye

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
Thought I'd never make it
Thought I'd never make it
Lifes so fucking fragile
Thought that I would break it
Shout out to my mom
Shout out to my dad
Shout out to my fam
They the best I ever had
Thought I'd never make it
Thought I'd never make it
Lifes so fucking fragile
Thought that I would break it
Shout out to my mom
Shout out to my dad
Shout out to my fam
They the best I ever had
