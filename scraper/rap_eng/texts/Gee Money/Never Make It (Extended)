[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
Thought I'd never make it
Thought I'd never make it
Lifes so fucking fragile
Thought that I would break it
Shout out to my mom
Shout out to my dad
Shout out to my fam
They the best I ever had

[Verse 1: Azure The Paradox]
According to my plans, Same Place is a classic
Flowing so ferocius, Like a T-Rex im jurassic
You can call me Harry, I be spitting all this magic
Times is hard they tragic, we never really laughing
Just hanging with the fam, and the squad they my day ones
I do it all for them, so this game I already won
Checks I don't need them, respect I got a lot tho
Shout out to my sister, popping pimples no McDonalds
Do it for my family, and my friends from the start tho
Same place, wrong time, shit not even hard tho
Talk about my rise, I didn't start from the bottom
The old me was an asshole, never met he dead now
Teno that my homie, Just like PRXJEK, All of RP
Orange Cream Shakes, every friday from Arbies
Drive around the town, they can trust me with the car keys
They can't stand my singing, say I sound like a harpie

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
Thought I'd never make it
Thought I'd never make it
Lifes so fucking fragile
Thought that I would break it

[Verse 2: Draco]
Every less I do
Each are the shots
If I remember to call it off
Then there is only the reason why
Guess I'd never see it eye to eye

Thought I'd never make it

Lifes so fucking fragile

Shout out to my fam
They the best I ever had
