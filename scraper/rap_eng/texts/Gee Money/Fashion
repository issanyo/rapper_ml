[Verse 1: Nana the Wave]
Ima do a lot of gold medals on this rap shit
Bolt bolt while i'm running on this trap shit
36 chambers for a nigga, do it wu tang
I was eating chicken at the yard, then the crew rang
Screaming
"boy, we gotta get this money, get ur ass up"
"do it like u boutta get the chance you'll never pass up"
"oh shit, its nana the troll, he'll never get known, he'll never get dough, he's not gonna grow"
Like bitch nigga, fuck you
Ima do it all by myself and get the money
I'm straight for the grind, and cake, thats filled with honey
Pharrells trainers with time like sprite, fill it with lime
A nigga been killing trap can he roll out n shine?
I wanna ask that question test it out
Ima go hard like erection
Trust that ima do it how i do it
Tried 5 different ways all 5 different days
Change can get u through it

[Hook: Nana The Wave]
