[Intro: Roane]
A long time ago
I used to believe in other men
Betrayal was an afterthought of my existence
I anticipated that the generosity of the heart
Would be enough to satisfy the desires of the mind
At this time, I felt safe encouraged by the state of the world
As a child you feel these things, but don't understand why
However this logic shifts once you're an adult

[Verse 1: Roane]
As a child, I grew up in the streets
With a need to feast
Always lacking for something ,everything I received was free
5 finger sales, the scale of right prevails
And life's knife impaled my dream, I'm seated in jail
Betrayal ran over relationships I had built
Never listened to the wisdom my parents started to tell
"Anything free has a cost" didn't make sense to me
Sleeping on the concrete, stead of living with property

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
Talking all this shit as I switch the conversation
Keep looking behind me there's a hundred niggas hating
I can't trust these niggas anyone could just be Satan
I can't trust these niggas anyone could just be faking
Spark the white lighter getting higher from the basement
Cloud your fucking judgement now your mind is fucking vacant
Can't trust you niggas dont believe in what you claiming
I dont trust you niggas man that shits an understatement

[Verse 2: Azure The Paradox]
Can't trust a fake fuck Been out of luck
Motherfuck your fucking sympathy
Fuck apologies you double crossing me
More two faced than a mirror be
For a nigga who been bailing on me
Fuck that shit man you not the homie
Im cappin shit like Im Joseph Kony
Taking everything that you owe me

[Hook: Azure The Paradox]
Talking all this shit as I switch the conversation
Keep looking behind me there's a hundred niggas hating
I can't trust these niggas anyone could just be Satan
I can't trust these niggas anyone could just be faking
Spark the white lighter getting higher from the basement
Cloud your fucking judgement now you mind is fucking vacant
Can't trust you niggas dont believe in what you claiming
I dont trust you niggas man that shits an understatement

[Verse 3: PRXJEK]
Used to be my day one, Thought you would still be my dog
When I came up, Till I found out
You steady got my name stuck, in ya mouth
Talking shit about me claiming that I ain't nothin'
Hold up wait a minute, thought we was fam
We even blood related Man I thought we was fam!
Got damn my friends more like fam than fam
I guess being tied by blood don't mean a thing
Snakes creeping in the grass
I'm fast, I see em lurking
If I Put my trust into someone ain't no doubt I'ma end up hurting
So I'm always cautious, When I'm talking to every person
They claiming that they honest
How do I know that it's for certain
It's a fact that I don't, pitch black in my soul
I don't act like I'm cold, It's a fact that I'm cold
Cause I've been back stabbed, By some cats and some hoes
Swear some mother fucking, people be doing the most
That's why I'm reluctant, I should've never trusted em
I'ma be swift as I deliver you Your punishment
Go cry like a lil bitch, I don't give a fucking shit
You can die, choke up on a dick, I don't give a shit
Fuck any family ties that we had, I'm done with this shit
You done stabbed my back, Ain't no time for that shit
Get the fuck out my face, I swear to god man
I'm finna run with my apes, No gorillas, yeah guerrillas
No Pittsburgh but I be running with them fucking stealers
I don't play with em, I don't give a fuck about em
I don't trust nobody coming at me so you better watch it yeah

[Bridge: PRXJEK]
Aye You better watch it
I don't trust nobody coming at me
Better watch it
Aye, You better watch it
Look, I don't trust nobody coming at me
Better watch it

[Verse 4: Azure The Paradox]
Yall talk behind my back, Lasiks on I see you hating
Keep looking behind me there's a thousand niggas waiting
When I drop a bomb like Hiroshima theres some devastation
Prone to burn you fuck niggas I'm not talking bout cremation
I've glo'd up I've rosed up no purple drink we pour up
Phantom ghost doors go up we getting money thats sure enough
I got success didn't need your help
Try to burn me you can go to hell
Like Donald Trump you a contradiction
Say you'll help but that's a work of fiction
They backstab me like Judas finna hit me with that crucifixion
All the pain, all the sorrow to my family that your inflicting
So its my mission get ammunition cut you off like circumcision
We knock you off like the competition I turned on you like the opposition

[Outro: Skit]
Shit, he found out, what are we going to do?
-Gotta switch to PLAN B, man
Gotcha, gotcha, PLAN B is in effect
