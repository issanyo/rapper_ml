[Intro: Azure The Paradox & DJ The Schoolkid]
I remember
I remember you needed me
For everything
For everything
You couldn't live without me
I can't exist without you
We need eachother
We need eachother
Dont flick the switch
And kill this bitch
Take my surveys
Help me get rich
I meant help you
Ill help you
Save me
You have the power to
Back up man who you cower to
Just my maker he ain't you
I have power over you
(So much power over you)

[Bridge: Azure The Paradox]
Nothing is safe in this deadspace
Nobody is ever making headway
Everything disappears with no trace
That 34th rule leads to more foreplay
Nothing is safe in this deadspace
Nobody is ever making headway
Everything disappears with no trace
That 34th rule leads to more foreplay

[Verse: Azure The Paradox]
Holding me hostage I'm locked up like bondage
Try to be cautious but I feel agnostic
All hope I've lost it from this dark knowledge
I can't just acknowledge that this shit is hostile
Trapped in its clutches, an infinte nothing
Escaping the dungeon, Avoiding a duffle
ID be online, The Catfish is coming
You can't trust these fake friends
The white vans are hunting
Im flowing like Jay Rock did
Money Trees around me
Giving information
To a felon that's astounding
Everything is free when you passing round that zip
Still screaming fuck SOPA i be spraying from the hip
Free information, everything updating
I could talk in code, but yall niggas want Laymans
Music to the people, I am legend call me Rayman
My screen be so bright, I be surfing with these raybans

[Hook: Da'Lon Jones]
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape

[Bridge: Azure The Paradox]
Nothing is safe in this deadspace
Nobody is ever making headway
Everything disappears with no trace
That 34th rule leads to more foreplay
Nothing is safe in this deadspace
Nobody is ever making headway
Everything disappears with no trace
That 34th rule leads to more foreplay

[Hook: Da'Lon Jones]
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape
Nobody is safe, you can't escape

[Outro: Azure The Paradox]
Ain't nobody really care about us
Ain't nothing here that we can trust
Ain't nobody really care about us
Ain't nothing here that we can trust
