[Intro : AD]
Roll that dough, pour that drink
Fingers to the sky give a damn what you think
Tell 'em I got the juice

[Verse 1 : Ty Dolla $ign]
I got the juice, yeah
From Adams all the way out to the Spruce, yeah
The bitches gon' choose, yeah
I'ma fuck her and I'ma give her the boot, yeah
Purple, red and yellow, I'ma pour it up
You a real nigga, you already know what's up
Louis and Irene, I only smoke Louis or Irene
Mix the Perc with the lean, hey
TGOD, shout out to my nigga, AD
You made it on your own that reminds me of me
Still screaming all out Pushaz Ink
Loyal to my niggas 'til I B.I.P
I brought 20 pistols and a whole lot of ammo
Ever since I could remember we been trappin' out the bando
Nigga with it too
If he got a issue somebody better tell 'em
Nigga, that I got the juice

[Verse 2 : The Game]
AD, I got the juice like Pac, blood
Five hundred gangs in LA can't nobody stop blood
Nigga with the shit yeah, fuck you bitch, yeah
Let a nigga slip yeah, full clip, yeah
I got the juice yeah Minute Maid man
I got the juice yeah, lemonade stand
Get a spray can, hit up on the walls my nigga
Won't shit move in my city unless I'm involved my nigga
Grocery bags, I got the juice by the way
Organic shit, I eat the fruit out Jhené
When she scared of a gangsta when he tipsy
I feel like Meek, the first time he fucked Nicki

[Hook : AD]
Tell 'em I got the Juice
Look, wait a minute
Tell 'em I got the Juice (Westside Compton nigga!)
Look, By the way
Tell 'em I got the Juice
Look, wait a minute
Tell 'em I got the Juice
By the way

[Verse 3 : AD]
God damn!
I told 'em I would get it
Niggas they didn't listen and Juice took over the city
Ain't heard your songs in a minute, can turn the channel you'll hear it
No major, I'm independent, you falling off or you finished
Bet you that it hurts when you look youself in the mirror
The man now feelin' like Michael Jack in a spirit
I’m flying Virgin Jet, got tired of coaching with Spirit
Grab the rock and I pivot, want war, whippin' with lyrics
Have The Game in the kitchen go Compton is mine nigga
YG he keep it funky, got Bompton on line nigga
We have come this far, you out of your mind nigga
The future of the Coast, I'm out  of my time nigga

[Verse 4 : OT Genasis]
Now how many hoes wanna suck this dick?
4 tours, 6 months now I'm so damn rich
Gotta talk that crap, gotta walk that walk
Try to pull up, then my gun gon' pop
You niggas dead if you want this bread
Got it on lock but I don't got dreads
I'm the man in the city, double O with a chauffeur
Had a little buz now you lookin' real sober
Three chains, big wrist, new car move bricks
Plus, I just bought a mansion that I'm hiding from my bitch
If she ever catch me then it might be a pop-up
Till then I'mma keep eating like Potluck
Black on the wall, billboard charts
Hundred millions views I will never loose

[Hook : AD]
Tell 'em I got the Juice
Look, wait a minute
Tell 'em I got the Juice
By the way
Tell 'em I got the Juice
Look, wait a minute
Tell 'em I got the Juice
By the way

[Verse 5 : IamSu!]
(Ah, Woo
HBK, yeah you know how we...)
Smell it, let me inhale it, I'm stuffing bands in embelishments
Swagger jacking repellent, I bag the swag up and sell it
I woke up this morning, had thirty missed calls
Bitches tryna get my dick out my Supreme drawers
Know if the team involved, know it's some green involved
Know if you need a hit we them niggas you need to call
I'm a rich city nigga like Calvin T
Cool as AC, got juice like AD
Self made millionare, the money don't make me
Time to go 18, I'm drinking that 18
If you ever had a question who was who
Ask the Bay about Su, bet they tell you that I got the juice

[Verse 6 : K Camp]
More juice than the average
Fuck how you feel bitch I'm going Randy Savage
Left wrist Rolex, right wrist karats
Jiggy with my cup I got more colors than a parrot
I got the juice, I got the juice
Jumped out that Benz and I hopped in a coupe
Hopped out that coupe then I jumped in a wraith
Shout out my nigga, he just beat the case
This is the remix, I'm on that T shit
I got more juice it's a shame that you niggas still think you can see this
Tropicana-tropicana
We gon' get it poppin' from LA to Atlanta
Bitches wanna bang I ain't talkin' bandanas
I'm just here to set the standards
Lil nigga

[Outro : AD]
Tell 'em I got the juice
