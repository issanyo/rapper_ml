[Intro: Samples]
"—The Documentary"
"—two!"
"—The Documentary"
"—two!"
"—damn it, I done did it again"
"—Game's still in Cali—"
"—Game's still in Cali, eatin' off The Documentary"
"—The Documentary"
"—two!"
"—damn it, I done did it again"

[Hook]
Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

[Verse 1]
Last ten been on ten
Make it look easy, my pen been on Ren
My niggas been on kush, my bitches been on X
King of California give a fuck who got next
I'm right now
Bump your gums and the ratchet’ll shoot ya
Send your ass back to the future
No Delorean
Aventador and shit, bumpin' Future
Why your girl pullin' on my hookah
Money stretch like Kama Sutra
Started with the roosters
Then I start spittin' clean the money like a loofah
6'5, tall like a hooper, ball like a hooper on the floor like a hooper
So I must be Clay with the .38, Thompson with the Thompson
Everything about me Compton—I mean—everything about me Bompton
I ain't never had shit, I grew up like Magic Johnson

[Hook]
Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

[Verse 2]
I taught myself how to spit from listening to It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold Ds is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking  la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris, Rihanna, Karrueche
Homie I ain't gotta gas I'm so ahead of you fags
The shit I spit off Premo tracks burn confederate flags
Take the roof off roof, gimme Proof back and 2Pac
Westside, but you already knew that

[Hook]
So, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

[Verse 3]
I've been rapping for 12 years, 6 months, 16 days
Now I'm a veteran, spit a 16 sixteen ways
Sixteen in a clip, spit it 16 ways
I know six teens, pull up to a sweet sixteen and spray
I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and bandits
Bruise and damage, fuck you rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the Wu in Phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer
Maybe the old Em, I'm Slim and I'm shady
Maybe the old him or Rakim, you niggas keep bullshittin' like Joakim
You so him, I'm so not, you so bitch, I sold rock
My four-four cocked, I been a Top Dawg, I know Dot
Back in '06 I pulled up in that gold drop
Five million sold livin' in the dope spot
Back when my first album was the—

[Hook]
—talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

Yo, what it do, Blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre, still holdin' it down
Aftermath, do the math, nigga, you know the sound
Doc 2, thought you knew, still holdin' the crown

[Outro: DJ Clue + DJ Envy + Funkmaster Flex]
Check it out, man, I go by the world-famous DJ Clue, desert storm, shoutout to my nigga, Game. When I first came to the West Coast, and me and Game hit the studio up, and he rapped for me, I knew he had all the key ingredients to become a legendary rapper

Here's DJ Envy from that Breakfast Club—I remember the first time hearing The Game, I just knew he was gonna be one of them niggas, one of them legendary niggas. That boy Game, he's a problem, I got my money on it

Funk Flex, baby! I dropped the bomb on every one of them joints off The Documentary!
