[The Game]
Dre you must've been of the Hennessy when you did this my Nigga

[Hook - Jay Love]

Is there anymore hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice on ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah

[Verse 1 The Game]
You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
Like niggas with dead homies till it's empty like my four pound
Niggas thinkin I'm drunk
Reach for my N.W.A chain and get your ass beat with the pump
Tell security it's Game plus 50
And he probably gets fucked up every night like Bobby did Whitney
Fuck poppin' Cristal
I got a bottle of Henny
Me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and Lil Penny
I ain't here so you can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like Beyonc√©
So let me be Hov' for a minute
Get up in your ho for a minute
And you could be my ho for a minute
Like I'm Diddy
Be J-Lo for a minute
From the windows to the wall gettin' low while I'm in it
All I gotta do is hit em with a Jay-Z line
Like you deserve to be my sunshine

[Hook - Jay Love]
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
Tell her where the af-
Ter party is
But make sure that you see her friends before
Before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh

[Verse 2 The Game]
I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt
Then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire
I'm a gangsta ma
I wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks both hands round your ankles ma
All I wanna see is ass and titties
Shake it like they do in magic city
With T.I. in that mothafucka
I'm like 50, be high in this motha fucka
You see them gold D's on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
My .45 to the back of your weak
Both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head
See how you like getting fucked with a pistol to your head
Tell ya girls I fucked your brains out
We can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out
I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out
"BITCH"

[Hook - Jay Love]
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
Tell her where the af-
Ter party is
But make sure that you see her friends before
Before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh

[Verse 3 The Game]
I got 40's like the liquor store
Pour it on your weave like that bitch in the G-Thang video
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
I know you used to niggas spinning but tonight I'm fucking
The truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck em
It's killa Cali nigga haters come a dime a dozen
Load em shells then I get drunk pissy
This bottle of Hennessy got me wanting to fuck Missy
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out
Play with her pussy then drop extasy in her crystal
60 seconds later I'm kicking that bitch out
Then ride down the show with the .45th out
Stop at the store
That bitch emptied my Cris out
Give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out
Niggas wanna know what this LA shit 'bout
Just visit when the Bloods and Crips' out

[Hook - Jay Love]
Is there anymore any more hard liquor

Make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, on ice, on ice, Yeah
