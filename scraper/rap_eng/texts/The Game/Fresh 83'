50 Cent (Chorus) x2:
This Is How We Do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This Is How We Do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Game:
Fresh like Uhh, Impala Uhh
Chrome Hydraulics, Eight Away Drums
You don't want none, nigga better run
When beef is on, I pop that trunk
Come get some, Pistol grip pump
If a nigga step on my white Air 1's
Since red rum, ready here it come
Compton uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Selling that skunk, One hand on my gun
I was selling rocks while Master P was saying Uhhh
Buck pass the blunt, its G-Unit, girls just wanna have fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the tongue
I'm banging with my hand up a dress like uhh
Ill make her cum, Purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front incase a nigga wanna stunt

50 Cent:
I put lamborghini doors on that escalade
Low pros, so low look like I'm riding on blades
In one year man, A nigga so great
I have a straight bitch in the tele. going both ways
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it girl
Your now rocking with the best
Trepound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off and if shit pop off
Somebody gone get laid the fuck out
They call me New Money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Boosie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

This Is How We Do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This Is How We Do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This Is How We Do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This Is How We Do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

Game:
I put gold daytonas on that cherry 6-4
White walls so clean looks like I'm riding on boats
Hit one switch man, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York riding on 100 spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it girl
You now rocking with the best
Four pound on my hip, Gold chain on my chest

50 Cent:
50 Uhh, Bentley Uhh
Em came and got a nigga fresh out the slums
Automatic gun, fuck a one on one
With rap punk ya punk ass stuntin ya done
Homie its gametime

Game:
You ready, here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this mother fucker crunk
It took 2 months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, Huh?
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slump
Thinkin I'm a punk, get ya fuck head lump
50 got a gun

50 Cent:
Ready, here it come
Got a sick vendetta to get this chedda
We rock a berretta, the drama set up
A palmer retti
My flow sounds better than average
On tracks, I'm a savage
I damage any nigga trying to front on my click
