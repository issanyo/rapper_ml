[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
When I touch, down
That California feeling's in the atmosphere
You know, you know, you know, ahh!
When I touch, down
It's wall to wall with sexy ladies up in here
When I t-t-t-touch, down

[Verse 1: The Game]
Kick the Roberto Carvatis off and let's talk (sex)
Let me whisper in your ear, how you like your (sex?)
Should I unzip your (dress?)
Step on out girl and tell me what's (next)
Do you love me? (Yes)
Do you want me? (Yes)
Then let me rub this oil all on your (flesh)
Take you out of them Vickies, make you forget about your (ex)
Let me spray this whip cream on your (chest)
I go downtown, you go downtown (next)
Unstrap my bulletproof (vest)
Take two steps back and just (flex)
And by now, you got to be (wet)
Like the ocean after the sun (sets)
It's over, climb up on my (chest)
I wore that ass out, girl just (rest)

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
When I touch, down
That California feeling's in the atmosphere
You know, you know, you know, ahh!
When I touch, down
It's wall to wall with sexy ladies up in here
When I t-t-t-touch, down

[Verse 2: Raheem DeVaughn]
When I step up in the club
You know it's going down here tonight
Put that Velvedere on ice
To let me know how you feel
Girl, is it real?
Girl, just make sure you understand
When I put this in your hand
It's so real (so real)
So for real (so for real)
Candy rain dripping down your window
Close the curtains and take of your clothes
I'll make you say "Oh! Oh!" (when I touch, hey)
Oh! Oh! (when I touch, ooh)
Oh! Oh! (when I touch, down!)

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
When I touch, down
That California feeling's in the atmosphere
You know, you know, you know, ahh!
When I touch, down
It's wall to wall with sexy ladies up in here
When I t-t-t-touch, down

[Verse 3: The Game]
There she go again talking all that (trash)
Girl stop playing, I tapped that (ass)
We can go real slow or do it (fast)
Just like I thought, you ran out of (gas)
And girl you're like the new S (class)
Every time I look at you, I want to (smash)
Get inside you and (slash)
You drive me crazy girl, I could just (crash)
Jump in your pool and (splash)
Then slow it down like a hour (glass)
Turn around girl, look at that (ass)
Beautiful as a Eli Manning (pass)
Round two, let's roll some (grass)
Get high, think about it and (laugh)
I want to try you on, let me pop your (tags)
You so fly, I want to check your (bags)

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
When I touch, down
That California feeling's in the atmosphere
You know, you know, you know, ahh!
When I touch, down
It's wall to wall with sexy ladies up in here
