The Game: This song is dedicated to all the mammas
All the beautiful women
No matter what color
My mamma Marie... Robin's mom Gloria
Yeah we see you shinin' (we see you shinin)
You all diamonds (we see you shinin)
We love you (Like a diamond)

Robin: Like a butterfly, you made your way out to the shell
Oo, Like and angel, you finally got your wings
And all of the promises you made yourself
Are finally taking shape
You can only hold something so beautiful down so long
Until it finds the light of day

Chorus: Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha)
Shining so (Kiesha) bright for you to see (Paula)
Pressure (Beyonce) builds diamonds (Mary)
Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah)
Pressure (Rihanna) builds diamonds (Latifah)
Shinin' (Michelle Obama) so bright

The Game: Uh, Picture a cold winter
Me, you , middle women hat and dinner
Philipe Childs a mister
Its the Robin Hood and the plot gets thicker
I know you think I'm bout my girl
My mamma, my unborn daughter, my world
But daddy used to beat you harder than the five barrels
He left you in the ocean and you came back a pearl

He put you through hell, I put you in diamonds
Forget about that nigga, we dont need him Mamma!
I know your only son was drama
You wanted Obama but he was Osama
On the block in its suicide bomber
Then I got shot and went to jail comma
If that ain't karma, me and my girl lost a baby in the womb
And it changed my armor

Chorus: Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha) Shining so (Kiesha) bright for you to see (Paula) Pressure (Beyonce) builds diamonds (Mary) Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah) Pressure (Rihanna) builds diamonds (Latifah) Shinin' (Michelle Obama) so bright
All the ladies in the back (I see you shinin)
All the girls in the front (I see you shinin)
Everybody with ya diamonds (I see ya shinin)
Yeah keep on shinin, yeah keep on (Like a diamond girl)
All the women across the world (I see ya shinin)
Especially my girl (keep shinin girl)

Vamp: Just like the ocean makes the pearl
Pressure builds diamonds
(diamonds...
Pressure builds diamonds...)
You can only hold something so beautiful down so long
'Til it finds the light of day

Chorus: Pressure builds diamonds (Aretha) Shining so (Kiesha) bright for you to see (Paula) Pressure (Beyonce) builds diamonds (Mary) Sparkling (Halle) for everyone to see (Oprah) Pressure (Rihanna)
