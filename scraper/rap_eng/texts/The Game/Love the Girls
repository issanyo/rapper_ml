[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
What you looking for baby? I know why you want love in the middle of the night
Don't be looking all scary, when you've been looking for this for long, long time
Come on over here baby, you can love me in the dark, you can love me in the light
Your friends looking all crazy cause you going home with me and they left behind
They can come too baby, what's yours is mine, as long as they fine
All them girls, I can't help it, tell them one at a time and they all ask why?

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Game]
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
You can call me your daddy, I'll be your lover or whatever you like
Girl, let me look at it, don't you make me have to ask twice
Cause I'm up in your city and I'm only in town for one more night
You ain't the only one here baby, so many girls in line, going crazy outside, let's go

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Game]
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones

[Verse 3: Game]
Take the roof off the Aston, pull the top off the Bellview
And we can do whatever you tell me, you smell me?
John V. Cologne, on yachts out in Colombo
When I'm home I'm Rambo, Sylvester Stallone
And she know that, picture us like Kodak
Red vines, red wine, listening to Bobby Womack
And it's a throwback, me and CB, tell 'em to hold that
And if you see a couple dimes, show 'em where the boat at

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Game]
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones
Me love me, me love me
Me love me, love me, love me, love me girls, she looking for them real ones

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Me love me girls, yeah you love me girl
I said you love me girl and I love you girl, yeah
