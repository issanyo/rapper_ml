[Hook – Skeme]
All I’m tryna find out, is who the hell lied to you niggas
They got you thinking that because I’m getting to a check I ain’t down to ride for my niggas
I got a full clip for the bullshit, tell that nigga don’t play me, I’m brazy
Strapped in like I’m ‘posed to be, I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me, no
I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me
I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me

[Verse 1 – Skeme]
YSL, been the man for a minute
All this Versace on me, the sky is the limit
I’m feeling like I’m Biggie out in Brook
Cause ain’t a nigga hot now as real as crook
SK, send shots at your chest plate
Tell them niggas I ain’t moving till the check straight
Nigga like me going brazy
I could do a buck 80 right now on the F way
[?] in a double cup, nigga tryna make the fucking hundreds double up
Head nigga, I’m a breadwinner, and lately I could give a fuck about a runner up
Fly ass nigga, ain’t no need for a stylist
Extend my clip, it got a barrel with a silence
Play about mine, know my niggas get to wyling
We young, there be new blue hundreds by the thousand

Strapped nigga like I’m ‘posed to be, I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me, no
I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me
I don’t want none of these ho niggas close to me

[Verse 2 – Game]
In that Bugatti on the 110
You ain’t never seen nothing like it, close your eyes then
You gon’ kill me when you see me, a’ight then
I’ll be waiting right here with these dice then
Shooting with the homies, shooting niggas uninvited
I put you 6 feet under like you five ten
All my niggas shooting up and that’s five five
Sipping codeine, smoking chronic, tryna skydive
Nigga hype down, you could die now
If you hit the four pound with the extendo that’s a five pound
8 pounds and 6 pounds, that’s an 8 ball
What the fuck is you on?
Been surfing for the last ten years now

[Verse 3 – Skeme]
Bad bitches getting called over
I need 100 Ms ‘fore it’s all over
And tell her keep her feelings in her pocket
Cause I’m not [?] crown on my walk over
Killers on my right and my left
He down to die bout this rep
Blood money, that’s all they ask
I got right now, give a fuck bout who next
