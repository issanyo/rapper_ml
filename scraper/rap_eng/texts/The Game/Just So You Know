[Intro]
Anybody
OKE
I need anybody
It's the moment ya'll been waiting for
Anybody I need
Anybody I need
Interscope, we had a good run right?
Ha ha

[Verse 1]
Listening to that Drake album like oh shit
This nigga Drizzy got me thinking 'bout my old bitch
You know what? Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
You got some bottles in your section, you can fuck that bitch
Jesus piece was a motherfucker
Gotta thank God like a motherfucker
Interscope ain't promote that ho
But Jimmy Iovine still my motherfucker
I'm back like Joe Budden hair if he grow it
I just signed with Cash Money, yeah nigga, you know it
Spending all my motherfuckin' money in LIV
Like goddamn bitch, can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Can a motherfucker live?
Brand new deal, drop top 'gatti
Coconut grove, can a motherfucker LIV?
Fly as a jet, motherfuckin' lear
MIA buzzing like a motherfucking beer
Real nigga here, real nigga career
Body any rap nigga, I'm so sincere
Six bottles Ciroc, couple hoes in here
Couple old niggas from a 4-4 in here
Nigga ain't dolo here
Got Desert Eagles under niggas' Polo here
Bitch bag back so my logo clear
It's Rich Gang. Dollar signs on the big chain
Ain't nothing new, I've been fucking with Wayne

[Hook]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know
In the club with Stunna popping off and you know
20K at king of diamonds bitch, and you know
California king ho, just so you know
And you know
And you know
And you know
Just so you know

[Verse 2]
Listening to this Big Sean like, "Oh shit"
My lil nigga Kendrick kills you on your own shit
But I fuck with Sean, it's just Compton, nigga
I helped him get his Jesus piece back from the monsters, nigga
I've been the middle man for rap niggas and jewelry
Niggas ask me find they shit like I'm motherfuckin' Siri
IPhone, S nigga, five homes, yes nigga
New coupe snap back with the roof
Hunned 80 proof, gotta throw it back to proof
Air Jordan Ones, North Carolina
I'm killing these bitches like Rae Carruth
They salute like soldiers, nigga
Been woke the game up like Folgers nigga
Treat em like lawn chairs, fold a nigga
Still got the West Coast on my shoulders, nigga
Key to the city, rap polices is watching
Hundred thousand on funerals
Bitches calling me Robin
Cause I'm a hood nigga, doing good, nigga
I'm God's favorite, I wish you would nigga

[Hook]
