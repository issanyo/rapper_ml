[Intro]
Yeah ah ha
You know what it is
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah ah ha, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah ah ha, screaming thats nothin'
When I pull out the lot, thats stuntin'
I rep my town, when you see me me you know everything
Purp and yellow, Purp and yellow
Purp and yellow, Purp and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, Im in
Purp and yellow, Purp and yellow
Purp and yellow, Purp and yellow

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Swish, twenty-four, that's Black Mamba
Snoop Dogg, he’s a dope rhymer
Collaborate with the Golden State
In a yellow six deuce with the purple plates
I dip and dodge
I hit three and roll
Fish and chips
Bounce pass down to Pau Gasol
We don't give a damn about the big three
LA Lake show we bout to three-peat
And you can bet, that's on the set
Ron Artest about to get wet
I'm on the flo’ and thats a fact
Sittin’ next to uncle Jack blazin’ up the purple sack

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: The Game]
Louboutin don
Purple twenty-fours, yellow Lambo I'm ridin’
Top blew the guts doors goin’ suicide
Stuff in the wood, niggas know we gon kill that
Blow it in the air boy, know they gon feel that
Purp and yellow, purp and yellow
Watch me ball like you sittin’ where Phil at
Ten car caravan Aston Martin’s and all them hood whips
Them Cutlass’s them Cadillacs’s that leather be grippin’ them wood tips
I was born up in The Wood
Claim Compton bet you ain't know that
Pops taught me how to get low in the floor clap
Went from a boy to a king
Any block I five five four that
Nigga better know that
Boy they playin’
Sawed off shotty
What they sayin’
Nothin' to a boss
I put two holes in that LaCoste
I come through fuckin' niggas off
Hop in that truck and get lost
You playin' with a king not Gretzky
Even if you let me
Keep your girl wetter than Game on a jet ski
Ooo cool, who say he smoother than a baby’s ass
Pops was a dope boy we still spendin' 80′s cash
Look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is
Blowin' on a scarecrow on my way to see the Wiz

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: YG]
Ridin’ down Rosecrans, Compton, California
Turn on the wrong street they might bang on ya
Home of the Lakers baby, yea you know its purp and yellow
Take a hit of what I got
I bet it have you seein' doubles
But I’m an angel though
And your girl's a pigeon
It's money over everything
Girl you know the vision
Never been a mark if you with it we can cut your fade
Brought out fifty
Blew up the city, young Saddam Hussein
Pusha Ink the label baby
Everything else is fuckin' boring
I’m at Roscoes eatin with some chick's who foreign
I took your girlfriend from your boy, you’s a mark
My white Beamer do the Wiz Khalifa, push to start
