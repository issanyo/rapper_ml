[Intro]
Yeah, let's take 'em back

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
'91 I stepped in this game
After 'Whats The 411?' things ain't been the same
And I can't complain but with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here and my music's still sincere
Let's get back to the story all of this pain and glory
And '94 was my life and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I been through

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Then I came with 'Share My World' but at that point I was just a foolish girl
Trying to find my way, then I dropped the 'Mary' album
And people were saying that it's just not gonna work
And my feelings they did hurt but my fans showed me so much love
And I owe it all to them and I came with 'No More Drama'
I remember that week, it was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it everyday and it made me change my way
I'm a real woman now because of all of these days

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
You remind me of a real love (you don't have to worry)
Real love, all night long I'm goin' down
Dodododododododah, dodododododah
Reminisce on the love we have
You are everything - love without a limit
What you gonna do without my life, my life, my life

[Hook: Mary J. Blige & 50 Cent]
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And I'm gon' shine homie until my heart stops
Go 'head envy me, I'm the soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
