I’m number five, somebody tell em the Michael Jackson alive
Somebody tell em too hot never die
Somebody tell em the vicky in my ride
And we on the west side
And try to make that type of love that never in
Do whatever I can to stay irrelevant
Be the elephant in a world full of vouchers
When nobody can social, that’s my culture
Well I’m cool in, I’d rather be on little acting of fulling
Best in my Louie Vuitton bet with the tool in
Just cool in, made a mistake I got an old job roof in
Say she met working, who stop who is this rolling the money
..my bank to put the pull in
Got a question for the haters can you swim
I am thinking so, so ain’t nothing to prove in

Hook:
Everybody hands up in the air
I’m just trying spread love everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everybody hands up in the air

I’m a kid full of projects, but drivin some
You think isn’t for an object
’cause I spread like the flame under the power rex
And all my haters like damn he ain’t dodgin
Go bum under the vibe we couldn’t kill big
Unless this, last to the.. conquer
Can’t thrill me in New York sign the middle
Couldn’t chill me a mother fuckin more
’cause it show the other mill me
Tell my Houston partner I’m trill b
Got my shut down focused still feel me
I thought it was a..can’t turn into a ..
Still on my crispy throwin my guns in the air
Chockin to everybody everywhere
Follow the heart and I bet you find have them there
And I know that you thought that I never care
Then I give my life was right and I ain’t never scared

Hook:
Everybody hands up in the air
I’m just trying spread love everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everybody hands up in the air

Life with the hands up now
Sitting in the guard are you starting in the crowd
I wanna hear you say yeah yeah
I wanna hear you say yeah yeah
Everybody put the hands up now
Just the one night have the job placed out
Let me hear you out hey hey
Let me hear you say, ey ey
Let me hear you say

Hook:
Everybody hands up in the air
I’m just trying spread love everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everybody hands up in the air
