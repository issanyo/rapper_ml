[Verse 1]
It all started back in '02
I never thought Compton and Marcy would ever feud
I ain't talkin' bout the big dude, big brotha to Kanye
Or da homeboy to the big dude
The fiance to Beyonce, had a protege
But wadn't no protege
That was as cold as Dre's
Fuckin with me, mc's seen their coldest days
He from Compton, rap like he from New York in the golden age
First nigga since Ice Cube from California to make Funk Flex blow grenades
I'm on the stage
I hear the crowd callin' my name
They goin' (Game, Game)
But I'm not one so don't try to play me
This goes for every nigga from Gucci Mane to Jay-Z
It's not a diss nigga don't catch feelins
I'll pull out the pen D.O.C. gave me a kill it

[Chorus]
If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh

[Verse 2]
As the clock strikes twelve on my rolly
And this bitch from da Big Pimpin' video starts to blow me (blow me)
In the phantom, I start to fantasize
This shit get thicker than bitches in Atlanta thighs
It's suicide...if you think you could fuck with the seven time platinum driver of that land rover truck
And my ego bigger then the 26's, what if my pen had low pros
I could ride them beats, like I ride backstreets
After Snoop & Nas hang it up, its a track meat
Nigga this race is fixed
Game recognize Game, I ain't never second place n' shit
My first 2 albums real basic shit
Spend half the time in the studio erasing shit
A Queens nigga made me mad, So I made some hits
And learned one thing, hip hop can take some dick (aaaah)

[Chorus]
If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh

[Verse 3]
Half these rap niggas wiping they tears
The other half wonderin' how the fuck Game got here
I took some weed up to Frisco, came back with a demo
Drove to Dre's studio came back in a limo
It was that simple
The cristal bottles and the bitches came later
And so did the haters
As the doc turns the nob on fader
And I turned the TV cause I'm tired of watchin' the raiders
Fast forward then Shaq gettin' traded
Then fast forward again then Shaq gettin' traded
And fuck all the time that was wasted
Beefin' with these wack niggas had me lost in the matrix
If I wanted the throne I would just take it
Put this .38 to yo dome bitch and just take it
I'm the music and it's time to face it
You niggas so fuckin' pussy I can taste it

[Chorus]
If I could show you all the faces of the MC's that I ripped....ah you would laugh, you would laugh, you would laugh
If I could tell you all the things that I would do to kill yo favorite MC you would cry, you would cry, you would cry
