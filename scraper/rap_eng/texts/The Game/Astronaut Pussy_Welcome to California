[Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1: Game]
Back to the Hooves
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can’t catch em now
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Couple pounds of the blue
Ivy in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J’s, closet full of J’s
Workin' on my Pippen, he’s Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like a Saudi in it
Murder with the ink, I’m Gotti in it
Don’t get too popped get your ass 2Pac'd
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain’t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it
That’s my new addition, no Bobby in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas’ ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same sad song, bring the bands out
Nigga should be workin on they money scheme
Back to the convers, kill 'em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Call the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse
‘Cus Compton ain’t like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas got them choppas like we flyin' the black hawk
Put you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was black thought
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4

[Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Pray for me, I’ll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
EverytHing on life and I’d die for it
Made a mill, you ain’t even know it
Tell Illuminati I’m down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Son niggas my new litter
Fuck tHe world on eartH day
Her booty clap on my birtHday
I would take tHe cake but I’ve been paid
I’m a real nigga, you’s arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama’s couch
Now I’m going big, I can buy tHe House
You sound water down, I sound off a ounce
See tHis for tHose wHo say "wHere you from"
If tHose Hoes wHo gonna make me cum
WitH them fuck niggas we don’t fuck witH tHem
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel tHe drum
If tHe bread low I’mma stack tHe crumb
Hide tHe contraband in-between my gum
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
WHen it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G’s, nigga pretty please
Condos, wHere it’s sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G’s
Hoover Hats like the star of David
Pull on sHots unless keep me faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'
Move out the set but the set I’m banging

[Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
Westside Ingles and I ain’t budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain’t about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain’t sayin nothing
This flow here, niggas can’t touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Sox gang off in the streets
10 hut, bring the squadron with me
See niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vent? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I’m a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I’m on, look at me
Started, started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood
Niggas gotta know that that’s all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up all bills
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
.45 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough loot to fill up a room nigga
And I’m rolling these blunts at 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin' for more
Made me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain’t got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I spit it, you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga this bloodin'
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

[Hook]
Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Welcome To California]
[Intro: Too Short]
Welcome to California bitch
Welcome to California bitch

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Stars are livin'
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining

[Verse 4: Game]
Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rows, backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemars ain't waterproof, fuck it go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape
Pause

[Verse 5: Game]
Where the angels fly, City of Angels I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That’s why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out like Durant in The Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton Avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?
Here’s my red rag, it says, "ain’t nothing to it"
They go the 60’s, motherfucker, good luck
(Welcome to California, bitch)
They go the 60’s, motherfucker, good luck

[Verse 6: Schoolboy Q]
From the corner where the hoes sell that kit kat
Short dress, hair down the bizack
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain’t bloodin' nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hell into gold, I can pon the river
HiiiPower, you a Amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoebox should’ve been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Key to the city, they should honor us
You don’t talk me a Game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, and this the 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning, uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed, just to kindle it, uh
Uh, yea now back to the groove, back to the hoes
Rat a tat tat in a 'Lac with a tool
No county jail, I ran on blow
Orange on the trim, straight lookin like Q
Figg tattoo

[Verse 7: Schoolboy Q]
I’m in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the Kee-Way, aye
Watch you know about LA?
(Welcome to California, bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us
(Welcome to California, bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they, pop pop pop

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Stars are livin'
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining

[Verse 8: Skeme]
Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I’mma bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better be killed
Just the way I make her feel, no Stephanie Mills
These niggas heavily trill, these haters never be real
I came up in a world where it’s kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck, fuckin' me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this Westside INGLCL
Bands on them bitches, getting ends on them bitches
Gold framed Cartier lives on the bitches
Last long like I’m using extends on them bitches
I’m a native, I got real niggas with me
Golden State, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the pigs
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me aight

[Outro]
This nigga Chuck want a nigga be in here
Rappin' all day and shit
Blood, I got to go get my shit braided
Nigga ends and shit all out
And I ain't got no lean?
Fuck this, we out this bitch
What's happening though?
(Welcome to California, bitch)

[Hook 2]
Sky’s not the only place
Stars are livin'
I know another place
Where you can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
You can’t stop the shining
