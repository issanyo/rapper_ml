I was standing up on my own two feet when I walked on down to
Meet you at your house. I'd had enough of that same old scene
I'd been wandering around with everyone but you
I'll be ok when you want to play your games
I'll feel no shame when you say that I'm your slave
I won't feel pain when you tell me I'm the only one for you
And you for me. Now it's after dark, down with Val and Steve
I've done everything I can to keep my cool
One more pass at Val and I'm on my way back to you
And me and ordinary lives. Damn this Wednesday night
'twas the worst to date. I wish I could say it's sad to see you go
