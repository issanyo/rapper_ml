I open my mouth and what comes out is dangerous, angel dust
Mix it up with cocaine and just kill yourself in Los Angeles
Niggas lost and jealous, couple tossed umbrellas
Too hot plus 45's is cocked blazing til we in clouds with Pac
Not to mention, these federal penitentiaries
Locking all of my niggas up giving them half a century
So the day they get out with Alzheimer's they won't remember me
And everything they did before 20 is faded memories

[Tech N9ne]
Hated enemies ready to finish me
Government wanna limit these men with G's
Spin it put them in a key, then it's me beginning this chemistry
I am tangled, cause living this got a man strangled
It's fandagled, hand me a plan from a damn angel

[Angel Davenport]
Angels in my city get it gritty, rioting off Henny
In clubs they act fast, packing, they gats got plenty
When you in my streets better open your fucking eyes
Niggas in front wanna take you down, in back wanna break your spine

[Game]
Stain inside broken glass
And to forget it all we grab a bitch and poke her fast
Walk her out holding ass
Anything for that Lambo, in years of holding cash
Spend it on a couple strippers and forget to hold the gas

[Tech N9ne]
Gas is high, but it ain't like me
I'm past the sky, you'd ask us why
We emotional and have to cry
Cause the cash is my way that I'm gonna last or die
But when they classify me as bad in the masses' eye
Dare

[Angel]
Dare you to go through all this sickness
Need a minute come to my senses
On block they pose, throw 'em to the dogs
Pitbulls then they place all bets in
Often I cop, often I fight bitches
Launder they thoughts, launder them leave stitches
Street vicious micro missions
Still play the game with the end in a vision
Might

[Game]
Give a bum a holla, toss 'em a couple dollas
Hit the window with them wipers, but forget your babies diapers

[Tech, Angel, & Game]
And that's the reason why we forever minority
Hatred for all authorities, fucking up our priorities
