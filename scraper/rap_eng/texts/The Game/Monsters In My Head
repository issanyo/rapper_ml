[Intro]
And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying
Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed
And enlarge my coast, and that thine hand might be with me
And that thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me!
And God granted him that which he requested


[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here watchin' my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothin' went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Runnin' from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watchin' Colors
Chasin' after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit
Good thing we had different mothers
Playin' football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kickin' back makin' money
Cause the crack fiend was always there
So I start sellin' that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office workin' that late night shift
Takin' care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweatin' over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go
Tryin' to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen

[Refrain- Colin Munroe]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head (Yeah)
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

[Verse 2]
Layin' here staring at this Doggystyle poster on my wall
Bangin' Snoop Dogg spinnin' this basketball
What the fuck is going on
In a nigga head
All of my homies gone to jail or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was nineteen
Chasin' a pipe dream
Crenshaw boulevard chillin', that was the night scene
And like the movies, niggas act a fool
When you pushin' a Beamer, who gives a fuck about a school
Mom's set a curfew, but I was breakin' all the rules
Kicked a nigga out the house so I started forming my crew
Gettin' a little bigger on my own
In the twelfth grade Crips schemin' on me
Cause they know my trap self made, tryin' to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower
That's how them coward's die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no nigga can see me I think they're going blind

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Seemed like just yesterday a nigga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a fucking gun
Now look what I become, nigga was on the run
From the Compton slums, they right, like father like son
But I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a nigga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my niggas in the grave
My nigga Big Will and my homie P D
Feel like yesterday we was just running in the streets
And I swear to God funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain is that we all die
So let your soul fly

[Refrain]
