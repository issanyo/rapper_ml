Walk in the club with 100 rounds
Let my niggas in and we shut it down

Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations
Cause me, I wasn’t made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who all paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that was dissin’ I pray to God that you see me

Freaky bitches love the money I make
And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn

[Meek Mill]

The roof on fire I’m only gettin’ higher
50 racks in my pocket I want bottles I’mma let that shit burn

[Big Sean]
Bitch I had one shot and I ain’t blow it
Riding til the wheels fall off and they tow it
I got green on top of green damn its looking like I grow it

[Meek Mill]

Shorty give me all that brain still ain’t never learned shit

[Big Sean]

Hit your girl in my whip and now that pussy got the new car smell
Same shit different day I ain’t broke no more it’s a different day
