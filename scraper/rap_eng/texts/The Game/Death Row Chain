[Verse 1]
I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was on, cause I fuck with Dre
Straight Outta Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything changed when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with Reasonable Doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In 1995 I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

[Hook]
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

[Verse 2]
Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe
'96, it was on
I took a Death Row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping "2 of Amerikaz Most"
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, "Death Row!" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that nigga Death Row chain

[Hook]
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

[Verse 3]
Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, felt Death Row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking Death Row chain

[Hook]
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
