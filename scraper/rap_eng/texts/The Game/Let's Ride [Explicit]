Pull the rag off the 6 4
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The D's is chrome, the frame is black
So watch it lift up 'til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the license plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me, nigga taste my rims
Let the chronic burn as the Dayton spin
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
'In Da Club', poppin' X pills like M&M's
Call it 'Dre Day', we celebratin', bitch, bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotiq down
Put your Cris' up if you feel the same way
Who got a mill switches? Everybody, let's ride
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath
Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at?
You fuckin' on the first night? Meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic and a gang of freaks
Move bitch, who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E
Take a picture with him and you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve
Got somethin' on my waist, say 'You can't touch Eve'
That's my gangsta bitch and like Crips and Bloods
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit
So nigga, twist up, light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
'Ain't Nuthin' But A G Thang', baby, it's a G thang
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your G-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath
Niggas thought I wasn't comin' back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same cherry 6 4 with the motherfuckin' top down
I'm The Game, nigga, call your bitch
She ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre? You passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'til the ass scrapes
Turn Sunset into a motherfuckin' drag race
Now watch it bounce, hit the switch
Let it bounce 'til the police shut the shit down
When you hit the club, tell 'em you came with me
We gon' twist up in the V.I.P
It's a new day and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke
If I could fit the whole hood in the club
Hop in the lowrider, long as it got bitches in the back
I turn into a strip club
Call it a lap dance, when the 6 4 bounce that ass
If I could fit the whole world in the club
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the West Coast in this bitch
Pop bottles and twist up
Roll up chronic and hash in a blunt, call it Aftermath
