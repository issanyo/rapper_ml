[Verse 1]
This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away
This for the niggas scheming on me but not today
This for the niggas thinking' I was all Dr. Dre
This for the magazine writers with a lot say
Come to my hood it ain't no good we cock and spray
Keep it gully like we out at fall Rockaway
Treat gangsta rap like it's a hood spot for yay
Come through the hood with a model chick that I got from 'Ye
And rose Phantom limitage just a block away
So let the beat knock while you bob your head
I switch cars jump in the C.L., smoother than Pete Rock
Air Max 95, flow classic like Reebok
Remember O1, try lay me down like shirak
R.I.P to all them niggas and all my niggas

[Hook x2]
Don't Don't End Up dead
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead

[Verse 2]
One thing about me
Always keep it real with myself
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow
Like the paint on this Impala
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap
Pac's revenge and I got a gun that clap, like Dr. Dre snares
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares
I been there, done that
Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga
Remember who brought 'em back to Compton
The 23 year old me was a fuckin' monsters
Still niggas say I ain't hood what fuck they talk' about
Like I won't kiss my sons on the heads and chuck em out
What up 50? let's talk it out
But until we talk it out

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim
Still payed them for like B.B.S. stock rims
Now I got California locked in
Dip in this Beamer, same model, different year they shot Pac in
So whats the "Top 10" if you dead
Who drop this Lamborghini if I'm in the feds
To times feeling spelling my nights up in the bed
But I'm from Compton so when I'm out its Infrared
Get my son ready for school and I kiss his head
So when you see my face in the mirror
If I end up dead bed
Never wore bullet proof vest and no got bullet proof Car
You know me Westside triple O.G
And I'mma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me

[Hook x2]
