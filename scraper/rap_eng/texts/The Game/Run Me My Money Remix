Let me tell you what I think about me
I’m a young nigga fresh about to CPT
The only thing,my mind is getting rich
Nigga run me my money
Bitch run me my money
Right run me my money
Nigga run me my money
Bitch run me my money
Nigga run me my money

[Verse 1 : AV]
Nigga run me my money, before a nigga get murk
You will be another nigga on a shirt
Bitch run me my money, you playin' pussy get fuck
Got a home girl beat the bitch up
Money on my mind, money in my pocket
I you commin' for a show tell 'em run me my deposit
Half all frontin' the other half wanna pull up
I leave if you ain't got it, tell my fans what up
Young nigga thugin', money over everything
I'm too real, yeah the realest you've ever seen
So a nigga better have my money
A bitch better have my money
Straight up!

[Verse 2 : The Game]
Young Money in this song
Nigga run me my money
'Fore I get some YG's and give 'em all 4 hunnid
City my stomach what you did?...
Clock on another phase,see him running
Nigga runnin' his own hood like fuck that nigga tho
Passes the bitch before I fuck that nigga ho
Yeah discrespect for ass nigga tho
Rich gang-bang tho
Successfull ass nigga tho
Hold up! Nigga got a few calls
Dumb nigga lost 25 on a Superbowl
Aye ! Nigga run me my money
'Fore I run him outta town
Wish a nigga would, wish a nigga could
Stack paper like a motherfucking sky scraper
But I ate him
Got a couple Vegas homes where they go
They are too short,put them like say ho


[Hook : AV]


[Verse 3 : Too Short]
I told to my bitch
You can buy that because if you can’t
You’ll find ,bitch
..I’m tired of this shit
No hustlin', no grindin'
No ballin’, no shinin'
No way I could live that life
In your mind you got a big fat wife
Take it out her ass and cleanin' all my cash
Oh, a nigga ‘s money bitch you ain't gon' last
Count it all and don't stop now
If you’re it's too short, you'll getting knocked down
Bitch
