[Verse 1: Techniec]
In the rain with the beat, stashed with the heat
Smashed in the seat, sinking and thinking ya'll know the way I rhyme
I'm a raw shined up, flossed out rhymed up
Get your wife good and ball it out till your time up
Want to kill him quick?, put him in a filthy ditch
Rather be filthy rich, over a filthy bitch
Wasn't for the flows
Wouldn't be no hoes jocking and breaking their necks to get your's
So I suppose, rockin' show, knocking hoes
Flockin, I'm clocking dough, I control
Rock-n-roll, with soldiers on lock-n-load
And they come through shoot it up
Fist fight, threw it up
Terrorize the future, truly number one who was us
No question we'll bust Glocks in fast cars
Blocks in Nascars, couple of bad brahs
We got a few with us, none 50 trust
You bitches hit the bus, you niggas ease up

[Chorus: Game]
I heard another nigga from that G-Unit click talking shit
She's Tony Yayo
And they kicked him out the house that's the reason why he running his lips
He's on 50's payroll
You want to die all you gotta do is keep on fucking with Game
Mr. Yayo
You niggas snitches that's the reason I threw out my G-Unit chain
I ain't the po-po

[Verse 2: Techniec]
You rap guys better stick to rap
Cause colliding with hood niggas that spit it
Will get you so called killas clapped
And you'll think it's the fans
But my niggas got the M 1 Sixes, get loose in the stands
Techniec on the side of the stage with a gauge and 4 4 long deuce-deuce in his pants
So I'ma just fall back, nigga I could lose you for a grand
No gunpowder, residue in the hand
They want to see Tech fly, they rather see Tech in the can
I spit grams, till the check in the hand
When the Tec in the hand, respect my demand
Or I'll find your set in a jam when the Tec will go blam!

Chorus: Game

[Verse 3: Game]
Drive-by, violator in the Bentley coupe
Ghost town outside, ain't nobody to shoot
They call me Noman for all the heads I shot
They call you state evidence for all the dime's y'all dropped
Real love cause I'm a million dollar killa
Got banana clips for you so called gorillas
G-Unit cap peeling till I D I E
You looking for me, Southern Cali is where I be

[Chorus: Game]

[Outro: Game]
Yayo stop running you bitch ass nigga
You ain't go to the jail motherfucker, you went to camp snoopy nigga
12 months in the motherfucking amusement park faggot
Thats what PC is to real niggas
My nigga was locked up with you nigga, said he held you down nigga
Got out of motherfucking jail, tried to hit you up nigga
Your cellphone went "diuw diuw diuw" this call has been.. you fucking faggot
Fuck you niggas man haha
G-G-GGG-Unot
