[Verse 1]
Yeah, lift 38th, I don't care what you bitchin'
O.D. on the track, need drug intervention
Look around hip hop, niggas walkin' in fear
We call the niggas, get tossed off a tier
Strong, hearted niggas get tossed off a pier
If it's my nigga, I'm gettin' tossed off a tear
Yeah, tell Rick Ross I'm here
All you gotta do is call me, cheers
Exterminate your rap for ya
Send a bitch to bust a gat for ya
Call me G-Money, I am that for ya
I do for Nas, what I do for kids
Hop out why, yo broad day, and shoot the shit
Nigga, do for Snoop, what I do for Dre
Violate my probation, let the rumors spray
Yeah, do for Shyne what he did for Puff
Sit in jail for ten years, who fuckin' with us?

[Bridge]
We are hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
Tell my mother that I can't stop makin' it
Tell her that my rags still hangin'
Tell her that my names still ringin'
That's how I live and die, on top of the world
Nigga's see I switch it slow
40 Ounces, rollin' down the liquor store
Got your ear twisted, but you don't hear me though
Back 4 to 4 times, nigga here we go
Oh, top down in the Phantom, the joints we smoke
Flyin' high, now I know
Oh, it's a new jack city, it's a new jack city

[Verse 2]
If Wayne is Nino, I bought Tha Carter
If it's Lakers vs. Celtics, I'm the departed
T.I. goin' in, I'm comin' out
Drop top Phantom's, show 'em what the song about
Roc-A-Fella used to (?) out
But I'm runnin' over shit, yeah bringin' the Hummers out
Gave Jim Jones my rag, let him rock it
Gave Young Money my flag, right pocket
Do it right if you gon' do it
And make sure you wipe it off it you gon' shoot it
All I used to do was sell crack and smoke Buddha
And now I'm poppin' Chris, cause I know Luda
If you say "Fuck Game", you better (?) chains
Get a vest, and start workin'n on your motherfuckin' (?) game
Fuck money nigga, I got enough fame
And you could trust Game

[Bridge 2]
Sittin' on the top of the world with his hands up
If you into gettin' money, this the anthem
Somebody tell my grandmama that her grandson
Got the hood on his shoulders and he can't run
He got to stay and fight

[Verse 3]
For my soldiers, the goons and the goblins
These rap niggas characters, Batman and Robin
Me? I had the Louie ville bad, and I was robbin'
Red shit on my head, I was Rodman
And I rebounded after G-Unit
I sell records, Jimmy ain't gotta sneak units
Used to walk to the door, my spotted peak through it
Sit, stare at my 'Pac poster and speak to it
Crack hip-hop, and let The Chronic seek through it
Niggas feedin' off me, cause I eat music
With my Dre headphones on, think to it
You waitin' on Detox? This the leak to it
