Couple court cases, couple shell cases
Trickling off the ground right next to where the Ace is
I can't take this shit that I'm seeing in the industry
I'd rather be everybody's enemy in the back of the strip club
Guzzling some Hennessey; I really made it rain with Meech
I got memories
Fuck with em here, blow out your memory
Take the roof off of the Chevy, we ride Kennedy
Like a bottle of Patron, one nigga can't finish me
Whoop a nigga's ass, he'll tell the cops there was 10 of me

Ice on my wrists, I ain't ever had an injury
Meanwhile niggas see me with the doctor

Pearl handle, but I don't eat oysters
Catch 'em in the hood, 24's on that Porsche
Annulment, had to divorce her
She ain't wanna get in the truck, I had to force her
Heard she wasn't giving it up, you had to force her
Buy homegirl some bottles to intercourse her
Where they do that at? Where my bloods at?
Where my soo woo rag? Where my lil nigga
From where they do voodoo at?
Four albums all number ones, go and Google that

Like I cried blood tears when I was gettin' the star
Like I told Vida Guerra she wasn't gettin' that far
Got some head, then I kicked that bitch up out of the car
But look at the bright side, it was a SLR
And you've been kicked out worse, don't act like I was the first
Then came Amber, alert
You ain't 'posed to talk about a nigga wife, but she squirt
Like a soda can, I can murder this beat if Yeezy and Hova can
So here we go again
Pounds of the kush, and couple of my oldest friends
Last week, I was in my Uncle Otis' Benz
Back it up into the throne, it's totaled then
Only had it for a week, it ain't broken in
I'll prolly never be king, it's kinda soakin' in

He had a complex, all I got is concepts
Classics, legendary straight up out the projects

Like my nickname Dick, I'll be rich forever
Pause... now applaud, and let these real Hip-Hop fans count my bars

Everybody sayin' they sick, I got lupus
And I'm still on the block, like the New Kids
I got a few kids, I got a few cribs

2.5 stupid, not a new crib
50 helped a nigga out, but the truth is
All of this shit from one freestyle on Whoo Kid
If I ain't the king, then nigga tell me who is
If I ain't won the west the last 9 years, who did?
I'll wait, while I'm starin' at my Hublot
In my Blackberry looking for bitches that do blow
Used to push weight, like a sumo
Give it to my bitch, let her stuff it in the culot
Take it to the visitor room, give it to Bruno
He nickel bag and slide it in the new box of Uno
But that's too much inf, for the you know
Where I'm from a rat'll never give orders to Bluto

Boost crime rate, then make Twitter crash
All in one day with my controversial ass

Keys overseas way before I had a passport
Keys in the trunk '95 Honda Passport
I got whatever you need, ain't gotta ask for it
Its a Dillinger in the V stuffed in the dash board
Nigga been fucking with rock, no Damon Dash boy
And it's a damn shame what happened to Dame
He ain't even get to keep his Rocafella chain

You was already down, nigga ain't have to kick ya
With ya own Pro Keds, in yo forehead
Nigga treats his own friends like the dope heads
Guess he Scarface and you Frank Lopez
This here holy water, put that on the Pope head
Something like a Priest nigga nothing like a pastor
When that R.E.D. drop just prepare for the rapture
Lock me out of Canada, balling like the Raptors

Got the 44 on me call me Tom Raper
Roll it up in the Phantom and blow it up out the Aston
All they see is R.E.D. I'm holding up all this traffic
They tellin' me I'm sick, but I'm sittin' fat like Magic

Won't appreciate it til years after I perish
Be a old nigga ballin' yeah Robert Parish
With a white bitch, cornrows, looking like Bo Derek
Got my white bitch in the hood, I call her Kreayshawn
She better stay between the lines like a crayon
Cause the block is something I spent all day on
Posted up with something long as the nigga Tayshaun
And I'm off probation, so I'm back in the kitchen, Raekwon
This is just a intermission, stay calm
262 Bars, Naplam
Thats 238 to go, this for my unsigned niggas just waiting to blow
I know its niggas 'round your hood just hatin' ya flow
Baby mama in ya pockets steady taking your dough
It's gon' be goons in the crowd, niggas hating your show
Couple niggas hidin' that love, they just hatin' to show
But what don't kill you, only make you stronger
Twenty minute sets, stay on ten minutes longer
I was just like you, still got the hunger
Couldn't see in the dark, feelin' like Stevie Wonder
Waitin' on my turn when Dre pulled my number
I was Spongebob for the next three summers
Then I did numbers, mama I made it
Took the Unit under, still got haters
Die hard fans from Compton to Decatur
Ten million sold, still carry the lasers

Kick in the door waving the four four
All you heard was the four four
Niggas jumping out the window on the fourth floor
But the bitch was scared to jump so I put her on all fours
Four albums, four plaques, phantom, four doors
I'm the only five, you niggas is all fours
That ain't a classic album, nigga you off course
You need to call Blaze, Swizz Beats or Scott Storch
Bon'jour wake up in Paris
Sippin on Conjure mix it with cranberry

We up on the top floor niggas
On the bottom we can see a lot more
Baby I'm a problem
If I see a spade and he sippin' on Spades, I'mma call him
Word to my son Harlem
Ya boy used to ski in coke, I'm talking slaloms
Courtside next to Snoop sitting with starlets
I got a thing for red bones and Louis wallets
See the watch making them drool, cause its retarded
See the cops pointing at dude cause he a target
The world is a shooting range, so I'm aiming at the Shy
And I'mma hit that mother fucker in the newest Range
Hit the south side, doing two and change
Watching Otis so I pulled over and blew the brains
Man its cold out this mother fucker Gucci Mane
Brr, chinchilla fur
Ain't have to move to Texas but I'm in that flying spur
Don't work with Petco but I could flip the bird
Who got snaps on the petro? Word
I'm trying not to hit my 6's on the curb
Nothing like Sonny but I'm driving in reverse
In love with the money, I shall never deter
Probably with the honeys on 54th and 1st
My pimp hand strong from Cali to dirty Jersey
Church, tabernacle, look at ya bird, she laughing at you
Shit is absurd, what happen after you niggas walk out the club?
Them niggas start clappin' at you
Sometime short days can turn into long nights
Steve Urkel niggas trying to life Capone life
You seen Vegas, don't get caught up at the wrong light
Shooting K's and handguns got a long flight
Yeah, got the lights on backyard looking like Vegas
When the fights on
Hood morning, Hood evening, Hood afternoon for no reason
Buck 50 to the face now you bleeding
King Leonidas, 300 while he cheesing
Hop in that 300, tell my niggas we leaving
Tell that nigga laying the ground, we even
No need for oxygen masks, he ain't breathing
Did it with the lights on, Compton raised a heathen
Ain't no fucking witnesses, but everybody seen it
They know what the business is, I'm ripping up subpoenas
Got no love for bitches, all I'm giving them is penis
Got to watch these bitches, they'll take you to the cleaners
They'll startch that ass, they'll press ya
Trying to be Kobe wife, bitch you ain't Vanessa
Bitch you ain't Monica, so what's with all the pressure?
I'm rolling my chronic up, bling on the dresser
Out in Santa Monica banging her on the dresser
I don't do the cuffs, but she wan't me to arrest her
Take another pump then switch the direction
Walk around dolo, I don't need protection
Unless I'm with a groupie, now I need protection
Four condoms came for the thing, I'm on that next shit
Two word minimum, I ain't trying to text shit
Two drinks at Mr. Chows, now we on some sex shit
Can't get through the door with this whore
She trying to success, she trying to succeed
She trying to blow me, no strings attached she like a Wii
But when the houselights come on she like a 3
Put her face in a bag, from behind she like Free
And I ain't have to buy the bitch a bag it was free
But that's just for me, give it to her like "Unnhhh" Master P
Ain't no limit, I go hard as mother fucker
Me and Pacquiao seeing stars like a mother fucker
384 Bars like a mother fucker
All out of breath I should pause like a mother fucker
Nah, I gotta go hard as a mother fucker
Drop top Gotti, foreign cars as a mother fucker
Started off small, living large as a mother fucker
In my rearview I came far as a mother fucker
Rip the head off Medusa and all the blood suckers
Peace to Baby and Slim them my blood brothers
Shout out to Waka and Jones them my blood brothers
Shout out to Styles and Kiss them my other brothers
Shout out to Tune and Ross them my other other brothers
Sitting here watching the throne, bored as mother fucker
(Lets Go)
Time to break the beat down for these clowns
Tell my Uncle Otis he can RIP now
Go to sleep now, my flow senile
And I ain't trying to get locked up, in the penal
System
I can't feel my face, I'm trying to feel the bass
But I got all this Ace in my system
Run circles around you rap niggas
Like I'm doing drills for the Pistons
Sleep comfy but I can still, hear the whispers
Draw steel, cause niggas still don't get the picture
Gotta paint it red just so they can see it
If you can't understand colors, nigga Ice-T it
Now bring the bass back, turn up the sneer
Tell the bitches with lace fronts start fixing they hair
And Mars give a nigga a drumroll right here
And right there, Yeah...
Back, Back, Back up on that rap shit
Keep that Louis napsack and that backpack shit
GTFOH, with that snapback shit
Fucking three bitches a night, call it a hat trick
Los Angeles, Kings meaning its more than one
Me and Snoop be doing our thing
And I kinda did away with the bling
Use to walk around every fucking day with the bling
In and out the fucking safe with the bling
Niggas come around they ain't safe with the bling
My shine is mine, catch a case for the bling
Out comes the 9 from the waist for the bling
Put this mother fucker in your face for the bling
Burn your tongue now you ain't got a taste for the bling
80 bars left, whole club sold out
And I'mma get this flow out until their ain't no fucking car left
Until there ain't a Cuban cigar left
See my nigga Dre in here, Yeah he on the far left
Long way from car theft, around the corner from homicide
If you seen the shit that I seen
You probably be traumatized
Remember when my brother died
Thats what made my mama cry
Spent four years alone then my grandmama died
Damn, I ain't never been the same
Pay homage to the woman that gave the world to Game
So the drama it will never die
That's on my mama five
Fuck with my kids or my wifey, that's when the llama fly
Can't afford to lose them
If I had to pick between hip hop or my family
Mother fucker, I'd choose them
As far as rap niggas, I break legs and bruise limbs
Stomp a nigga face in, in some huge timbs
Niggas don't invite me to shit, I had to move in
Annihilated Bleek, had to tie a couple loose ends
Couple crashed cars, had to lose a few friends
Wifey want an Escalade, I just copped a new Benz
Fuck stock, hood niggas ride new rims
Dubs too small fuck it go on 22 then
22 shrinking now we on 24's
Won't be long til 6's sittin' on that Porsche
Niggas chopping Maybachs, clever, raw
But I'mma chop a Chevy, Mad Max the '64
Bitches love it, niggas like that
Hip Hop was high school punch, I had to spike that
Tell 'Bron and Wade the nigga Mike back
If Uncle Otis rubbed you wrong, go get the ice pack
Undisputed beef king, who the fuck could fight that?
You wanna hit the surplus store, then bring a knife back
Niggas goin' gold, "shit them is nice plaques"
Finally, get your ass in the ring
Won't fucking fight back
Everybody wants you to swing, go ahead and strike back
Me I'm spitting nothing but flames
I'm like a strike match
Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks
This is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?
Me, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur
You don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door
I got something big under the T-shirt
On the front it say "Tha Carter IV"
I'm about to order more
Nigga they ain't told you?
It's like the Gulf War
Put a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4
'Rari on the green, got a V12 Ferrari on the green
I be twisting Bob Marley on the green
I took 100 thou just to add another Mazerati to the team
Should of saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine
Any drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines
Not the Source or the XXL know what I mean?
Rolling Stone, ain't getting my Vibe
So I remain King
At least til T.I. home
As far as the east, ain't no King nigga B.I. gone
Far as bars that four ocho cinco
So the next line is for Ocho Cinco
Easy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so
I'mma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink yo
Where Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo
Star on my face, I'm a star like Ringo
Ten bars left, su woo is the lingo
All red everything, no visine though
Just left Boston, no Benzino
Hit something out in New York, Bambino
And I coach my team like Pitino
He know, we hit King of Diamonds
Everybody throwing C-Notes
On my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno
Feeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino
Matter fact fuck him, De Niro in Casino
500th bar, Fuck You; Cee Lo
