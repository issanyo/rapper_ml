[Intro: Martin Luther King Speech]
I am happy to join with you today
And what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation

[Verse 1]
So it seems I’m lost
In between exotic cars and fiends
Palms hella itchy, baby mama bitchy
Dish washer broke cuz them pots too sticky
Snap back to the back cause I got that crack
And I’m from that city
Where even the girls is packing they strap Beats on
They don't hear that rap, shit
Unless it’s Y.G or Problem
Then them bitches turn up ASAP like they went to school in Harlem
But they know they from Compton
Yea they know they from Compton
Where we put bass with the head before Dre was with Monster
We pulled guns on niggas 'fore we ever play Contra
Turned contra into bands and that make them hoes dance so
Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids
And you be forced to watch that bitch leave
And that’s every nigga’s situation
In a town where them gang signs go up
And them bitches going down

[Hook: Elijah Blake and Game]
Life is a but a dream
I’m searching for a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is everything but a dream

[Interlude: Martin Luther King]
A great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free

[Verse 2]
Niggas robbed 2 Chainz on World Star, I seen these niggas runnin
Them ain’t yo niggas no more ‘cause I got mine's comin
You take a nigga jewels and act like you done did something
We take a nigga life and act like we ain’t did nothing
And all of this is at the push of a button
I got niggas bustin' simply because they ribs touchin'
No we ain’t tryna work at Mickey D's
Niggas is tryin to put that six on Ds
And flip one of them Bentley keys
Hood niggas that only wanna be hood rich
Stack a hundred thousand in the safe and wife a good bitch
Cop a Gucci belt, maybe Louis too
Line a Challenger with that Camaro and see what it do
Hit toxic ‘cause we got a fit and can't wasted it
It’s hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes’ faces
Ask Drama what that shit do
Every time he hit the city give him a couple hoes and a pistol
‘Cause I, I hold my niggas down
I said I, I hold my niggas down
Yea I hold my niggas down
And the day I go out this is Kendrick’s crown

[Outro]
No, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until “justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is everything but a dream
