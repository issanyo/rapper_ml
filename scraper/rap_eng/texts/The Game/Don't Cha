[Intro: Rockstar Dior]

Yea, uh (hype hype hype), Uh (New jersey devil)
(Black wall put ya mutherfucin hands up)
Cicero, rockstar, carry-D whatever you choose.. makes me no difference
Yea (try to move)
Let get into it (feel us)
Uh, slam, Uh, check it, uh

[Verse 1: Rockstar Dior]

Yea, yo, what he do?
Niggas don't know how I move only roll with the crew
Rollin' up the trees, loadin' up the tools
Niggas get a little outta line, gettin blown let her choose, uh
Yea brads on my dick, heard that I spit with the game
Signed with the black wall street got some glitz in my chain
Got some chips in my pocket, with a clip that I bang
Use to have hit the steet for the change, now shit changed
I can hit the strip in the range
Yea I hit the switch in the range
That'a make it bounce (bounce bounce)
Niggas better get it corrected don't disrespect it
I do chat shit when I check shit
Drive by loaded window down when I wet shit
So niggas gotta cool out before I gotta move out, yea
And y'all dont wanna piss me off
'cause I might have'ta get the fifth's involved
Trigger balled in front of that
No I do more where your stomach at
Y'all booz dont want none of that

[Chorus] X2

Dont cha wish g-unit was black wall street
Dont cha wish g-unit was black wall street
..Dont cha.. Dont cha..

Ye when the rig, carnartion or fig, ye when they come to the shows, girl's undid they clothes, niggas playin with the kid, they wanna stay under control, but they wanna see me wavin a stick,....dig a grave for ya, aim for head, some ma mans may'aim for ya kid, knock at the door, when they in and up, let the trigger buss, wake the babysitter up while he playin at the crib
