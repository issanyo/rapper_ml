Wyclef Jean:
Pull it, Pull it. Dont Pull it if u ain't gonna use it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it
Pull it, Pull it. Dont Pull it if u ain't gonna use it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it, Pull it

Big up, pick up, its a stick up, stick up
Nobody do something to pick up pick up
Call 911, nobody pick up, pick, cuz the goverment dont care about

Niggas, Niggas
In the hood turn niggas to cop killers, killers
We come through ridin' on them three wheelas, wheelas
It kills to be killed in my village, village
For the love of the money, them cat pillars, pillars
We run trough your hood like godzilla, godzilla
With guns big enough to kill gorilla, gorilla

In the club we shinin'
Vivi es' diamonds,and we still bad boys like Mario Winans

We hotter than the fucking chinchilla, chilla
We strap but don't tell it to the squilla, squilla
Them omkeinsta gangstas don't fill up, fill up
Snitch boys get buck 50, and the grillem', grillem'

Chorus

Enemy Line, Enemy Line. Dont be caught with your chopper in the enemy line
Enemy Line, Enemy Line, how there in Compton, the Enemy Line

Bullet, Bullet. Dont bullet if u ain't gonna use her, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, Bullet.Dont bullet if u ain't gonna use her, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet

Coralian is the ultimate high, who gon' stop shottas, the gun datters
They give me one more chance like BIG Poppa, to make it hotter
But who's hotter than a rude boy that goes after rasta... faraian
Me and my entourage walk up in the party and smoke that bitch out like a Ducati and I'm nicked to the nigga that pulls triggers like treasures
I push your blood klaat head, for that fucking Rolex

Then past the millimeter to left hand side
Rude boys never die, we multiply
Me and Damian Marley, Wyclef and the fugee homies in Kingston
(Big up, Big up the bad man them)

Twentytwo bullets, but not lettin' into England
Niggers starting to singing, drama what we bring them
G-money makers, no time for the haters
Cuz hustla in Jamacia, right in Jamaica

Bullet, Bullet. Dont bullet if u ain't gonna use her, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
Bullet, Bullet.Dont bullet if u ain't gonna use her, bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet

Inna di ghetto with no food to eat and
No education got no school to teach and
Nuh shirt to back dem nuh have nuh shoes to feet and
All opportunities dem outta reach and
Pay close attention to the sounds of (it?) and
The strong ah take advantage of the meek and
Silent too long without a voice to speak and
Everyday the same thing ah repeat and
