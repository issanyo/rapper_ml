[Hook: DJ Paul x2]
I look, I feel, I smell like money (x2)
Just look at me dummy
Loo-look at me dummy
Pull ya shades down, get a good look at me dummy

[Verse 1, DJ Paul]
Once again it's on
Or should I say my eyes on
Back on the stove
I'm somethin' like a Amero
The way I make it twerk
I keep some good work
I'm into Culinary
See me on the Food Network
Smilin' in her ear, with a 'gar in my mouth
In the V.I.P, man we standin on the couch
And I got a whole lotta lock-jaw women
But it's too bad half already in me
Clownin, doin donuts in the Charger wit' a Hemi
Comin' down ya block like
Vroom-vroom, do ya hea' me?
Headed to the club
You can catch me in the powder room
When I'm in the hood
I'm in that trap bangin that boom-boom, boy!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: The Game]
If I ruled the world, I'll shake it like a chronic leaf
Fuck all day, smoke and bang UGK
Roll up sticky, and surround myself by dime pieces
Rocking cuban link, drive fast cars, is my thing
Hood nigga for real
Bar steel, stack mill
Fuck your bitch for thrill
And keep patron on chill
Mafia way done, sipping on Louis Vuitton
Slippers on the baddest bitch
You ever seen in the [?]
Los Angeles bread, get down [?]
Stack paper with Three 6, keep bricks and [?]
Vietnam niggas, sip and don niggas
Platinum change, foreign exchange
The nigga Game
