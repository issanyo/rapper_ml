[Intro: The Game]
Sometimes I pull up on Brazil and Wilmington
Like 3 o'clock in the morning, stop my car, let the top down
Don't nobody know I'm there, just reminiscing 'bout the days when we used to be in Larry Nickel's crack spot, with my brother Fase
King Frog, Squid Big Dan, D-Bo, B-Los
Back when Lil' Frogg and Badass they was lil niggas
Lil wild niggas running round the hood
My nigga Slim 'Ru is in the joint doing ten
That's my solid nigga, on Bloods, my nigga Peanut, he in jail now
My lil' cousin Domo and my homeboy Buddha Ru, this Cedar block

[Verse 1: The Game]
I remember days like this, my nigga
We was tripping 'cause we hated Crips, my nigga
Shooting out of six trays and shit, my nigga
He was slipping so we sprayed his six, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
A kid shot cause he raised his fist, my nigga
Fiends stealing 'cause they can't get a fix, my nigga
Sharing needles, passing AIDS and shit, my nigga
It's fucked up but I was raised in this, my nigga
Been smoking purple haze since six, my nigga
And my moms wasn't no lazy bitch, my nigga
I seen her hustle that's what made me rich, my nigga
But all this shit is overrated that's why I don't give a fuck no more
I don't want this Benz or this truck no more
I started off doing this shit 'cause I love this shit, Blood
Seeing the homie slap box, I love this shit, Blood
Sitting in my Impala like I love this shit, Blood
Weren't never 'bout a dollar, I just love this shit, Blood
Scrapping after school, Compton high wasn't bool
Could have went to Centennial but I love this shit, Blood
Used to bang Quik, yeah I love this shit, Blood
Mausberg was sick and I love this shit, Blood
Then I gave Wacko my demo outside of Food 4 Less
He came back in ten minutes like "I love this shit, Blood"
West side Piru, I love this shit Blood
Elm street to the Fruits yeah I love this shit, Blood
Crip neighborhoods too, even though they blue
Compton is where we grew and I love this shit, Blood

[Bridge 1: The Game]
I seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done took some fades with Crips, my nigga
My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
But that's the shit that made me this, my nigga

[Chorus: Asia Bryant]
All my life's been so complicated
But I will never turn my back on Compton
Our shit is so overrated
But I will never change who I am
So I'm riding for Compton
I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride for Compton

[Bridge 2: The Game]
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done took some fades with Crips, my nigga
My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
Got a voicemail from Braze, what's this, my nigga

[Outro Voicemail]

You know I only call you when its on some real shit, homie
