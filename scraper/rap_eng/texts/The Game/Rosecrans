[Hook: Candace Boyd]
Got my windows rolled up
Cause my niggas rolled up
As we riding down Rosecrans
Hit the bottle on the low
Look around to make sure
Cause we riding down Rosecrans
I'm high, like when I'm rolling on a bridge
Nigga you know what it is
When I'm riding down Rosecrans
You never know what you can see
RIP, RIP while you riding down Rosecrans

[Verse 1: The Game]
Just hopped off the 110, know a nigga smashin'
Pulled up on his bitch in a G-Wagon like "god damn"
Dippin' down the 'crans, right on Wilmington
Right on Brazil with me and my niggas chill
Big Fase, Frog Dog, Bad Ass and Chuck
On the dead-end street, Bompton nigga, what's up?
I brought cake to the hood, brought Dre to the hood
Brought Drake to the hood, nigga you straight this my hood
Chuck Taylor nigga, Hurricane, Baby Cane
And I rep, from the Cedars, to Pasadena, Denver Lane
And all my niggas reppin', from the 20's to the saints
Welcome to Los Angeles, caught slippin' then yo chain gone
Day in Hoovs down for life, tell her stay strong
Get a dope spot at the studio, niggas be cooking all day long
Just bought a Bentley Truck and dropped that motherfucker
And Problem got the weed, hotbox this motherfucker
Hell, yeah

Got my windows rolled up

Nigga you know what it is
When I'm riding down Rosecrans
You never know what you can see
RIP, RIP while you riding down Rosecrans

[Interlude: DJ Quik]
I am the abominable DJ Quik
And I'm here with the boy Problem
We got Game in here, we got Wiz in here
It's a problem baby
Super Dave, y'all know where Roscrans is?
It's a long ass Avenue that goes from the beach to the streets
And it probably ain't got no potholes in it
Cause I know they done fixed them
They got money in Compton now

[Verse 2: Problem]
Crossing over the railroad tracks
That near got packed out in the canal
Slid out then got some of the crew
Came back like "what's happening now?"
Pardon my young niggas going so wild
It's just how we used to be back in the day
Get out the way, you ain't got no business this side of Santa Fe
Mark? (Just get down and look up)

You never know what you can see
RIP, RIP while you riding down Rosecrans

[Outro: DJ Quik]
Cookin' in the hood, you know it's all good
I put gravy in my shit
Me and Problem came back
To hit y'all in the head with a bam-bam
They call that shit the club
Remember that shit bam-bam used to have over his shoulder?
Bink
