[Lil' Scrappy]
I'll leave yo' ass crispy like some Frosted Flakes
What you call sneakin' nigga, man Jake the snake
Every nigga on the street got something to say
Until they get sprayed in the face with a K like Mase
I don't fuck with fag niggas lets get that shit straight
I was lifted by a preacher so my mom pushed weight
Now I hooked up wit game real nigga with flame
The nigga show me Cali' love and I ain't in no gang
Any nigga that roll wit me betta keep it G
I'll Break ya vertebrate, push a DDT
Lets get the sippi yall niggas ain't even gifted
Bust a shot at your chin your top getting lifted
G's up get your G's up Scrappy with your weed up
I fuck with G-Unit So yall state get they ass lumped
Your homeboy really going through something I can't change
I fuck hoes that would make Mya look lame

[Game]
The realest of niggas I role wit them killas (yeah)
The world gotta feel us my clique is Gorilla
You niggas in trouble I'm on the track with the BME clique
You ain't gotta know I'm signed to Dre to know that he sick
P89 thats what I handle my beef with
Put them hollow tips under your arms like speedstick
Ride through your hood in a blue impala like we crips
Roll down the tints, G-Unit
I'm a head busta, lil scrappy when the lead touch ya
And they ain't no coming back when you dead fucka
Sleep in your earn and get eaten by worms
Trying to fight a fire with bottled water he'll get burned
They tampered my phones like D-R-E and the firm
Cuz I'm buzzing like Wu-Tang and it ain't even my turn
So who it may concern, you'll get your whole mouth wide
Fuckin with them gang bangers in the SOUTHSIDE

[Hook]
