[Chorus]
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all i need
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need

[Verse 1: New jersey Devil]
Hit the switch sun roof top, no diamond in the back
Jacob on my wrist so the diamonds in my lap
Four times platinum, hit the weedspot
I'm strapped 'cause I ain't going out
Fucked up sack or blueberry wrap no
Me and my bitch 'till it's my time to go
Trigger-finger the same one to fire up the dro
You know I'm fast smoke by myself
Won't pass to ask to hit it it won't last
And I won't crash one hand on the roach
One hand on the wheel time for another bag

[Chorus]
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all i need
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need

[Verse 2]
Skip-skip nother my clip nigga- click click
Now who talking shit nigga?
Three wheeling through the crime while I stare through
Chewing policies bandanna in my rear view
Got my guns, got my chucks
Flipped up another way to get my nuts licked up
Starter cap turned back
A old school nigga with no cheese n craft
One false move my young g's will cap
With south central to compton fasho we fly like 36 ounces nigga

[Chorus]
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need

[Verse 3]
Hit the block all the homies on the dice game
Both leagues in the dirt fucking up my ice creams
And my ice chain got a nice gleam
Shawty with a brown purple bag on my night train
Industry one hand on my heat
Never bring sand to the beach
Rubberband on my jeans, i'm the man for the beat
40 cal to your grill, keep blaming your beats
Put a hundred grand where you sleep
And before you black out see the man with the sheets
I get you wrapped in chronic covered ha sheets

[Chorus]
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need
Smoke what I wanna smoke riding on hundred spokes
Drink what I wanna drink hypnotic and Hennessy
Say what I wanna say NY to LA
One hit of the chronic is all I need

[Outro]
Dub sizzlle- Black wallstreet
One hit is all I need
