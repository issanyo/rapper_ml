[Verse 1 - Game]
Used to be a 40oz nigga
Standin’ on the corner no money for the Vodka
Now you see em' broke tell him holla, wanna throw him a couple dollars
Follow me, on Twitter follow me in the streets
Be on my 2Pac zone when I creep, and then I’m gone
Back on my gang shit, you know the chain sick
Throwin’ up the roc tryna to figure out where Dame went
Aye now pop champagne
Tell them hoes that I’m in this bitch with Lil Wayne
We got Young Money, we got old money
We got Jay-z, Beyonce show money
We got Daniel Gibson and Keyshia Cole money
And we got haters but that better than no money
We got Taylor Swift and Sheryl Crow money
2010, we comin’ for your money

[Hook]
See red when I sleep
Got a red Lambo twenty two’s on the feet
Catch a red eye private jet
That’s me red room for my dogs in the street

When you see me on the creep
Got a redbone chick in this red leather seats
When I get into the house we layin’ over the sheets
Take it off, red Louis Vuitton on the feet

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Brrrat, Pearl white bugatti
Flash cash flag on the top
Spend a nigga band and we out, big money shit been ’bout
See this game blood
Nigga gave me the gang so I gave it to my bloods
MULA, Fresh with the new fleet
All red Y-M-C-M-B (so priceless)
Big money on the white sheets
Mil how we sleep, presidential suites
A-K’s on the harley
Maserati, keep me a farely
And my Bentley with the black mag
Brand new Porsche strap stashed
Twenty two in my Benz jeep
Chopper long on the back seat

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Take the chopper out the trunk and go east-side with it
Split a nigga in two, make a peace sign with him
Play with the pussy, put the peace sign in it
I never thought I’d see a fuckin’ free me sign nigga
Young Carter, niggas know I’m blood
Bad red bone sittin’ in my tub
I ball hard I don’t need a sub
Break yo bitch ass off like a ticket stub
What it do, I’ll show you what it does
And everybody knows real bees don’t buzz
Pull up in the drop top off where she was
And later on tonight I’m forget who she was
Pimpin ain't easy, no pimpin’ ain’t Weezy
Got too many bloods, I could never be anemic
You know my motto, put it in the air
And I fuck with the game, like a true player

[Hook]
See red when I sleep
Got a red lambo twenty two’s on the feet
Catch a red eye private jet
That’s me red room for my dogs in the street

When you see me on the creep
Got a redbone chick in this red leather seats
When I get into the house we layin’ over the sheets
Take it off, red Louis Vuitton on the feet
