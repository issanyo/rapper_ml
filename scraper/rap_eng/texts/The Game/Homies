[Intro: O.T. Genasis]
I'm fuckin' with the homies
I'm fuckin' with the homies

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
My mama told me, "Never go out after nine"
Fuck that time cause I had me a nine
Watched a homie cook that zone in the kitchen
.357 with a nose like Pippen
I always asked, "Can I go to my granny house?"
It's easier to sell 'em bags out the candy house
I never got time for my bitch cause I'm gone
Out with the homies so she think I'm doin' wrong
She say, "Be careful cause they might hit you up"
I'm lookin' at this bitch like I don't give a fuck
Burner on my hip, yeah, the life of a thug
All my homies bang, I just wanna sell drugs
My homie locked up, pop a nigga in the room
The way this shit goin', shit, I might see em' soon
Rubber grip, hollow tip, .44 Mag'
Brains outta pocket, make 'em look like it's red

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Ain't got time for a bitch
Thirty-nine in the clip
I'm fuckin' with the homies
My bitch tryna stress me out
I'm 'bout to leave, bitch, let me out
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Turnin' up on the block
Get harassed by the cops
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Ride for my niggas
Die for my niggas

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm fuckin' with the homies and I'm lucky to be alive cause Palmer Blacks tryna dome me
I got this ninety-inch Sony, sellin' this bitch for half off, who's fuckin' with the homies?
Chillin' with the brodies, blowin' on this dodie
Hit the park whippin' on these YG's like Jodye
Five-five-four, Cedar block if you know me
I was there in the bounty jail with Monster Kody
Fresh out, hit the avalon, red khakis on
Then I tuck the burner to get a burger from marathon
Red boys jersey, wore that motherfucker to an all crips school and I'd be dead if I ain't wear it home
Fat red laces and some coneys, got jumped by the track news, fuckin' with the homies
I got my whole hood tatted
Who we bustin' at tonight?
It don't matter cause...

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Ain't got time for a bitch
Thirty-nine in the clip
I'm fuckin' with the homies
My bitch tryna stress me out
I'm 'bout to leave, bitch, let me out
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Turnin' up on the block
Get harassed by the cops
I'm fuckin' with the homies
Ride for my niggas
Die for my niggas
