[Verse 1]
I'm like Method Man and Red Man with the swishers
Blowing chronic out my mouth while they taking pictures
I tell that bitch drop that ass like she hit the switches
I take the phone and take a selfie while I'm fuckin' bitches (take that heat, yeah)
Now bounce to a nigga that know Dre and O'Shea
I kill that pussy like OJ and no way a nigga gonna outsmoke me
I smoke more than B Real and that nigga Snoop D-O-double G
Throw up the Westside, even if your fuckin' rag on the left side
Tonight I'm fuckin' with you, two ice cubes in my cup
A little Henny, nigga with an attitude, what's up?
Yeah, 6-4 Impala and I'm outta there
Bitch riding shotgun, looking like a bobble head
Wait, wait, wait for a minute and let a nigga roll his blunt (get high)

[Hook]
If you still fuck with Dr. Dre (get high)
If you miss 2Pac and Nate (let's get high)
I mean, every time you come to LA (get high)
Ain't it good to you? (yeah, yeah)
The doc said I had a weed addiction
So I'm smoking this chronic with no prescription, (get high)
Break it down, get a blunt and twist it
Game got his own strain, Doc 2 edition

[Verse 2]
When I say roll it up, roll it up trick
It's Aftermath, let 'em know who you fuckin' with
All we do is smoke and get high
We be having slips, let 'em smell this shit
35 Million and I still might sell this shit
Gray smoke, elephant
Look around this party, ain't this motherfucka hella lit?
These niggas is zeros, we came with pre-rolls
Same niggas used to moving kilos, (get high)
Yeah, all fuckin' day nigga
See me bouncin' in the six-six-tre
Like I won't let this motherfucking terror destroy
Three-wheeling with a cloud of kush in my jaw
Thousand dollar blunts, what a nigga want?
Pistol grip pump, ride with it in the fuckin' trunk
California skunk, nigga this the funk
Top of the Roscoe's with the front, my Impala, (get high)

[Hook]
If you still fuck with Dr. Dre (get high)
If you miss 2Pac and Nate, let's (get high)
I mean, every time you come to LA (get high)
Ain't it good to you? (yeah, yeah)
The doc said I had a weed addiction
So I'm smoking this chronic with no prescription (get high)
Break it down, get a blunt and twist it
Game got his own strain, Doc 2 edition (get high)
