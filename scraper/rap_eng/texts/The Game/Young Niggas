[Intro]
Ray Ray: So what's up Lil J?
Lil J: We down Ray Ray
Ray Ray: So what set you claiming?
Lil J: Claiming Hoover and South Shores
We down with 32's in most quads, straight like that
Ray Ray: Straight like that huh?

[Verse 1: The Game]
We grew up as friends, we was 10, lil niggas on the block
He ain't have his own basketball, so we shared my rock
His mama was a fiend, he ain't heard from his pops
He used to share my clothes with him all the way down to his socks
He would spend the night, that one night would turn into a week
At least until his mama got back on her feet and she never did
So he moved in with me, my mama, and my sisters
Couldn't let him go to foster care 'cause she ain't trust the system
So she took care of him like he was me
Gave us everythin' she could back when shit was all good

[Hook: The Game]
Just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas

[Verse 2: The Game]
Niggas turned 12 in '92, we was headed to the 7th grade
Runnin' 'round, stealin' cars, dreamin' about the better days
Duckin' strays, catchin' fades, tryna make it through this maze
Teachers out here smokin' J's and wonder why we misbehave
Same book, different page, another year, different age
Cross colors, colors cross, bows turnin' into fades
He started Crippin', I started Bloodin'
Now we walkin' through the halls of school
Like we don't even know each other
Young niggas

[Hook: Sonyae Elise & The Game]
Young niggas, out in these streets
We was just some young niggas
All in these streets to feed
Young niggas
Lord knows I don't want no enemies, yeah
Young niggas in these, ohh

[Verse 3: The Game]
Started off as brothers but sometimes shit fall apart
How can I hate this nigga with all this love up in my heart
With this nigga mean muggin' every time we in the class
Nigga tuck that blue rag or I'ma beat your fuckin' ass
Guess my mind gone
Caught him after school, he ain't had no ride home
Still got that rag hangin', that's what got him fired on
He pulled the strap ,so I pistol whipped him with the chrome
Wasn't tryna kill him, coulda pulled the trigger
I was just a young nigga

[Hook: Sonyae Elise & The Game]
Young niggas, out in these streets
Just a young nigga
All in these streets to feed
Just a young nigga
Lord knows I don't want no enemies, yeah
I was just a young nigga
Young niggas in these, ohh

[Verse 4: The Game]
Whopped my nigga ass, he ain't take it on the chin
Rumor startin' to spread, I guess it's on when I see him
Two weeks pass and graduation came around
I was walkin' through the choir, .45 under my gown
Had to take a leak, so I headed to the bathroom
Corner of my eye, seen him comin' out of the class room
We exchange words, so I cocked the 45th
He shot, I shot back, thank God I ain't get hit
But damn I miss my young nigga

[Hook: Sonyae Elise & The Game]
Young niggas, out in these streets
Just a young nigga
All in these streets to feed
Just a young nigga
Lord knows I don't want no enemies, yeah
Young niggas in these, ohh

[Outro: Sonyae Elise]
Young niggas, young niggas, young niggas
I ain't the one nigga
Damn I miss my young niggas
