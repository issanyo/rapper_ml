[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
My nigga Game
I remember when I first met the nigga!
Nigga hella-flamed up, flagging and all that
Nigga told me he come through Cedar Block
Out there in Compton and shit
I said if this was one of my niggas from New York this nigga be my nigga
Even though he from the West Coast, he still my fuckin' nigga
Crazy shit though is even though it seem like the homie be strugglin' between good and bad
At the end of the day, it always come from a genuine place
Love that nigga

[Verse 1: The Game]
I wake up in the morning to Ciroc and some pancakes
Give a fuck about a bar, bitch, this a mixtape!
Give a fuck about a car, bitch, this a Rover!
You drivin' a mistake like me dissin' Hova
But I don’t give a fuck, nigga, do it all again
Rule number one, never make a rap nigga friend
But I run up on a muthafuckin' rap nigga Benz
In Miami feeling like Khaled, “All I do is win"
Eighty thousand on the bracelet, watch got a face lift
Drivin' through the hood in this muthafuckin' spaceship
Feelin' like the first man on the moon
Draped in all black, whole club full of goons
Pumpin' bottles 'til them pretty hoes move
Tonight I’m fuckin' with bitches with scars and bullet wounds
Live in that Ferrari, sleep in it like a tomb
Soo Woo straight up out my mama womb, nigga

[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I’m blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I can see clear through the haters

[Verse 2: The Game]
From the cradle to the grave nigga, do it hard body
But I never fuck with a bitch with a hard body
Soft as a peach, life is a beach
And I’m in Venice laid on the beach, white sheets
With a dime-piece starin' at my timepiece, what it say?
By six o'clock we be chillin' at the Mandalay, nice
Chandon on the ice
Swimmin' in this fuckin' money, buy a hatin' nigga life
Ask about mine, nigga, I reply twice
Bitches run around my house, three blind mice
Get lost in this muthafucka
But I never get crossed in this muthafucka
Rottweilers at the door!
Dobermans by the pool, Dimes by the furnace
Live life like Capone cause a muthafucka earned it
Paper planes with them hunnid dolla bills
Spent a couple mill but still, nigga

[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I'm blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I can see clear through the haters

[Verse 3: The Game]
One love to my niggas, two claps for my hoes
Buy a dime piece some clothes, well nigga, I suppose
I can get her Jimmy Choos, don’t mean that I'ma do it
Went light skinned 'cause my first baby mama blew it
Now I’m stuntin’ on dem hoes, what happened to the Buick?
Nigga turned rap star, God bless music
Now a nigga gettin’ head whenever I choose it
Blues Brother’s jewels covered in that new Goose n’
Grew up on that Snoop shit, Gin got me woozy
Got me feelin' sorry for my nigga Lil' Boosie
Turn up the fuckin’ radio, bang a lil' Gucci
Get high as a hummingbird, and touch a little coochie
Yeah, I’m a made man, bitch what you thought?
If I want an Aston, that fuckin’ bitch bought
Tell my nigga AR, 'Go open up the vault'
And fuck what it costs, money talk, nigga

[Chorus: The Game]
I'm in all red like my brake lights
In the kitchen on the stove
Tryna get my cake right
I work late nights, graveyard shift
Nigga gotta keep it trill
I'm blessed like the angel on Rolls Phantom grill
Don’t make me hit my brake lights
It’s a cold world, but it don’t taste right
Gotta get it baked right
Eyes in the rear view
So I could see clear through the haters
I paint the whole town, same color as my brake lights
