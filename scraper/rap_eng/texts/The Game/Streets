[Layzie Bone]
Now I sound so raw, cos I'm down by law
Trying to play me cos I'm rapping I will break yo jaw
Catch a nigga in these streets make you take clothes off
Leave you dead butt naked
Man you fuckin' with a boss, cross pass with me
I'm in the hood all them watts in the Bronx where they cater all around
The devil block, trouble not
I'm ready for em, niggas they know I'm ready for them
I'm the hardest I'm a ? so I'm heated heavy for it
Why you looking for me nigga wit yo looking ass
Meet me at the Club all my niggas get to whippin' ass
Then a nigga sue me, sue me nigga pos'ed to be thug
Nigga Pos'ed to be street, pull your skirt down nigga cos we smellin' yo pussy
The whole bottom line is you can't fuck wit' me
Will.I.Am the ghetto!, Will.I.Am the ghetto! (Streets)
Cause' I'm a thug by nature, thug by nature
Gotta keep thuggin', I'm thuggin', gotta keep thuggin', I'm thuggin'

[Chorus: Will.I.Am]
You looking, for me, ill be, rollin'
You can find me in the streets, you, you can find me in the streets
If you looking, for me, ill be, rollin'
You can find me in the streets, you, you can find me in the streets

[The Game]
Its the black rag assassin, fourty fo' mag blast
And black ski mask throwing shots out a dodge magnum
Gang bang forever put the barrel on the head of the devil
Wit homicidal intentions I reign terror
On any cliq or squad you niggas bitch you fraud
I'm a tickin' time bomb let it finish the job
Lyrical damage on one, two punch, crush you amateurs
Box and watch me execute like (cockins?)
My flow piping hot scorchin', proceed with caution murder any mc
Ya soul is lost, when I'm ridin' with them bone thugs, black Glocks and chrome slugs
Parked on the block with the nose up, get ready for the face off
Nicholas Cage ain't got shit on a nigga with a fuckin' grenade
One man army, only two things in the world can call me
West pussy and that bomb ass chronic
I never back down, never back down
Never back down, now let the bone thugs back

[Chorus]
[Krazie Bone]
Now we them niggas in them black dickies and steel toe boots
Stomp on that nigga that got a pistol but he still gon' shoot
Cause he a hoe, like half to these niggas is rappin'
I'm a let you know, these niggas is actin' and puttin' on a fancy show
We done checked these niggas, met these niggas man I don't respect these niggas
I'm a real mother fucking T-H-U-G, original hate to be a critic
But yo shit I ain't feeling, no, you niggas is elementary
I got history, lyrically you can't see me, physically ill bring your misery, seriously
You niggas ain't been hearing me, but listen to these other niggas hits
You hear my twist they blew my shit, but its all good, cos we keep it all hood
And when we see niggas get rolled dog like a hog should
Just lemme put the mother fuckin' money on the wood
Bitch niggas would be gone if they could, but I'm a shut em down
I'm a shut 'em down, I'm a shut em down, bone niggas known not to fuck around!

[Chorus]
If you lookin'!

[Wish Bone]
I got my hand on my balls, grippin in the raws
Hood star, shit could be my boulevard, you know I'm in the streets
I ain't hard to reach, on some cool shit and some beef shit nigga I'm in the
Streets, this ain't my only occupation hittin' avenues, chasin' paper always
And I know how to get It, and pissy hallways, in the raw way
You can get it how you live, nigga step the wrong way
I let it bang b-bang bang, I'm the street for real
And I love it but you know how the game play got me ready to kill
Somebody, but its all good, wit' these shows at my streets nigga all good
Gotta be stacking my paper like that's all I know, these niggas is playin'
I gotta get it like lock and load, winter through summer, summer back through to winter
We hustlin' dawg, hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
Give it all you got, give it all you got, hustlin'
Niggas is talkin' bout weed now watch
Yo mouth!

[Chorus]
If you lookin'!
