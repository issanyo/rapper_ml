(Intro)
Attention:
This is a Gangsta service announcement
Fuck Niggas, get your ass off the dance floor
Make room for the muthafucking gangstaz

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

(Chorus)
Yeah, yeah, this is for my thugs in da club with the strap
(Waiting for 'em to bring that gangsta shit back)
This is for my dawgs gettin' money wid them packs
(Waiting for 'em to bring that gangsta shit back)
Radio rappers on RNB tracks
(Waiting for 'em to bring that gangsta shit back)
Niggas talk business that they know they won't clap
(Waiting for 'em to bring that gangsta shit back)

(The Game)
Out with the patron, in wit the G's
Take off da Foams put the Phantom on some D's
Ridin' through Dade county, blowin' the palm trees
Can't hit the car booth till dis bitch get off her knees
Yeah, doin' circles round the circle house
Blackwall, Maybach, nigga we'll merk you out
Wid no remorse, let the Goose take it's course
Hit you with the M, slide off, in the black Porsche
Then it's back to the shore club, all white linen
Chain lookin' like Staples Center, lights in it
Bitch nigga, we them gangsta rich niggas
Cocaine cowboys worth over 6 figures
Gotta Glock 9, real nigga, cock mine
Put more red on the corner then a stop sign
Walk in the club, more diamonds then a rock sign
Take the Rollie off, show a nigga how to stop time

(Chorus)
This is for my thugs in da club with the strap

(Gunplay)
Sack full of solid, fat Gucci wallet
Fat Gucci collar, trickin' what cha call it
Heavy in the game, so I put the Chevy in the game
Puttin' down like Belly in this thang
Black magic on the wheels, whole dead crackers on the bills
Hoes shaking naked in their heels
Still bout yam, yeah i still wham
... still fucking with a player parlayin'
Nigga on clout, blowin' on loud
Strangling the cloud, can't turn it down
Bank on big, Dank on deck
Talkin' all crazy, I ain't state nothin' yet
Purp, patron, pills off these sniffing hill
Gotta couple hundred, throw it like a millionaire
Motherfuck a sale, motherfuck a plaque
(Waiting for 'em to bring that gangsta shit back)

(Rick Ross)
Frivilous energy, enemies envy
My only dream is one grenadine Bentley
Forgiato's sit well on my Audo
Teflon fit well in my car door
I invest in stocks, Blackwall Street shareholders pressin' blocks
Breakin' down the ounces amongst all the councilors
Black buildin' ... is how you announce us
I'm in the houses, fuck all the bouncers
.........................
