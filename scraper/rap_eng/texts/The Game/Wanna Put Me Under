N**** got a V12 engine mouth
Til i bust that chrome
They screamin like a b****
When them hollow tips crush them bones
When i call 50, BANKS && YOUNG BUCK is on
They bringing heavy artillery
When I chirp that phone
Grew up with the holy ghost
Went to church from home
Badboy since birth like justin combs
Been to the county jail once, it ain't feel like home
Promised to never go back if n****s left me alone
But the hood is the hood, n****s hate to see me get money
So i cut the grass and i can see the snake n****s comin
They dont want me to be the best, so i prepare for the worst
You got a teflon vest?
Lemme see if it works

[Chorus]
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
But till the day i die, G-Unit gon ride
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
Hate all u want in your living room but dont come outside
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
If u wanna witness the album, come see it from?
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
TRY and I'll make u my b****, n**** suck my d***!
Still like the every other city I go, n****z is fake
Down bottom LA to up-town NY state
No disrespect to my fans
I mean the n**** that would shake ur hand, kiss ur daughter on the cheek
Snitch on u then take the stand
N**** that live by the modo
"Money Make The Man"
He ain't gotta walk home, the sargent let him take the van
And Quick said:
"Dollars make Sense"
So imma interior decorate his impala
Give him red tints
They ain't got those in THREE - ONE - OH
Or WESTCOAST CUSTOMS, f*** em
And any who love em
I spent a million on Bail nothin
Show me his hood, I crush him
G-Unit get money and n****s gotta suffer

[Chorus]
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
But till the day i die, G-Unit gon ride
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
Hate all u want in your living room but dont come outside
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
If u wanna witness the album, come see it from?
N****s spendin the rest of they life tryna PUT ME UNDER
TRY and i'll make u my b****, n**** suck my d***!
Homie I'm scared, I might have to take ur life
So when them thangs come out, u better run
Homie I'm scared, for the sake of my newborn kid
Cuz i might have to do life in the pen
Homie I'm scared, to kneel down and wash away my sins
Try me and I'll do it again
Homie I'm scared, I been behind the trigger more than once
Whats gon happen to me when god come?
