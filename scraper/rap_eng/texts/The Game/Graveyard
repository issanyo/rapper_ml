[Verse 1: Game]
Welcome to the graveyard
Where everybody likes to pray:
Allahu Akbar, you scared to say "God"?
They call me Game 'cause I play hard
So get your helmets and your face guards
I spit holy water, lets have a face off: Nicholas Cage
They say the boy is off the chain like two pits in a cage
Your girl say my flow the bomb like I swallow grenades
Respect the rules up in this shit so you gotta get paid
Or you gotta get sprayed
Like Windex with them twin Tecs, or Raid on top of insects
Niggas die fuckin they family over, where I'm from they call that incest
Open the Bible, the good book serve its purpose for shook crooks
Heavenly Father, I think me in Heaven'll be a good look
Give all these niggas a good Hook

[Chorus: Sam Hook]
In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard
(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard

[Verse 2: Game]
The cemetery ain't as new or the saint that it look
They bury ministers there right next to straight crooks
And Nas told niggas they was shootin' and they'd look
Niggas lyin' 'bout bangin', getting whooped on Facebook, aw
Now put that on your wall, I put that on the Wall
I shot-call and ball quicker than John Wall, aw
I'm killin' you niggas
Bought everything last year and wasn't feelin' you niggas
Mean, I was numb last year, wasn't feelin' you niggas
Came back to sell a few more mil on you niggas
Toast! I'm in the Phantom, nah nigga I ain't scared of no ghost
'Cause all the dead rapper's albums are sellin' the most

[Chorus: Sam Hook]
In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard
(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard

[Verse 3: Game]
Some say the third verse puts niggas in the hearse
Since I was born Jay, guess I'm The Gift & The Curse
Lot of Bloods out here, but nigga I did it first
Spill blood out here that's why I'm up in the church
Still repenting for my sins, but not all the way
Cause I just rode up in the Benz and handed homie the K
What he 'gon do with it? Prolly 'gon run up on your crew with it
That's what I call rap beef, lucky I'm through with it
Now I just lean back, '72 with it
Sell it to a nigga down south, he act a fool with it
Back to them haters and them stool pigeons
You too busy tryna judge us stars, but how are you livin'?

[Chorus: Sam Hook]
In this heartless world that I live in
I have learned that I can't depend on love
It hasn't made me a cent
So I'ma take it all with me to the graveyard
(With Game) Bury it in the graveyard
