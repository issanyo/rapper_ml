[Justo]
What up? I be the one they call Justo if you didn't know
Trying to check my man DJ Skee with his new mix-tape
Pick it up you square, you heard what I'm said?

[The Game]
It's another sad day in Hip-Hop
We lost another one of our brothers, Justo Faison
We love you, and we'll always miss you
Mix-Tape King, forever

[Hook]
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo

[Verse 1]
I picked up my pen four years from the date
Never thought I'd be rapping, and be signed to Dre
Never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on the Clue mix-tape
On the Birdman beat, then my name started buzzing
Aftermath's young gun, and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's little brother
He took me to Kay Slay, and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King, I should of known, cause all of the sudden
MC's calling my name and I'm beefing with Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colors
Then caught him at Def Jam and found out, it was nothing
Looked back at my career, staring out at the City
Thinking about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to Bad Boy, would 50 be on the Math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they start showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out I was with Dre
And at bodegas I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix-tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the Vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houston's and that's the first time I met Nas
Had Billboard with me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the Documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix-tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels getting' scared
Cause the kid from Compton selling like Sunny and Cher
Mix-Tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, Mix-Tape Artist of the Year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new kind of the West Coast
A couple of months passed we ain't speak
My Sidekick went off "Justo Rest in Peace"
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if you know like I know
Live your life to the fullest one day we all gotta go

[The Game]
Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fitted Cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend
Justo Faison
Mix-tape King
Rest in Peace
