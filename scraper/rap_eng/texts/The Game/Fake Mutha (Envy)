[Verse 1: R-Mean]
Shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak
We all tryna win
But then again, maybe it’s for the best though
Maybe its not
Maybe all of this was just a test yo, ace’d it cause watch
Mean a student of the game
Teacher of the same though
I say that with a grin but dawg, I'm bleeding, man it's painful
Defeat the fallen angel
Really there's only one goal
Just a bunch of fractured creatures tryna become whole
Envy ruined our people
Money root of all evil
But recognize insecurity's the root of our ego
Living truly deceitful
Masking the truth from ourselves
No heaven in sight but I got a beautiful view of hell
Lucifer knew me well but who can we tell
You give the devil an inch and he'll truly be your ruler as well
But fuck it though, them lames mortified
Should have wrote these rhymes in chalk cause homie this straight homicide

[Hook: Jason French]
Everything revealed in time
Envy that you kept inside
Me say, no don’t you go and try to hide
Cause you a fake muthafucka, fake muthafucka

[Verse 2: Game]
Angel wings on the Ghost
And you can get something identical to this bitch for the coast nigga
Razor blades at your throat
Guess I been to New York city too much in my lifetime
Smuggle raw uncut cocaine through the pipeline
A1 perico , tell 'em sell it at the right time
Infiltrate the block with base like it's '99
Eddie Bauer Explorer, the speakers blaring Nas
Turn it up so I can run in the spot, finish the job
Pull burner, she like "whoa"
Fuck is you, Black Rob?
If so I'm a Bad Boy, it's time to twist the knob
Empty the clip then cut the tip off of my cigar
Hard to stomach when you pussier than your woman
Different strokes, different folks, long way from Philip Drummond
Ay R play look out, blast if they start running
And let a nigga know if cops coming
Westside nigga, what

[Hook: Jason French]
Everything revealed in time
Envy that you kept inside
Me say, no don’t you go and try to hide
Cause you a fake muthafucka, fake muthafucka

[Verse 3: R-Mean]
The flow polished and purified but dirty as sewer streams
Menages with broads wishing there was two of Mean
I stay up in your bitch like Nuvaring
Hurting, for certain
You fake muthafucka you deserved it
I seen the true colors hide behind ‘em, what he figure
Secrets floating to the surface like they dead bodies in the river
There's the devil, seen ‘em grip that steel
All I know is people get fake when shit gets real
For real, this fucker mad dogged me
Never rode a damn Harley but I been a son of anarchy
Sometimes I wonder where your damn heart be
Cause you can diss me but disloyal is something that you can’t call me
You disgust me acting so distasteful
It's really a disgrace how we diss grace though
You mis-raised, six faced, bitch made ho
Jealous eyes tryna jinx me, no
Your crew hating
We bomb on these suckers see my crew's Kuweitin'
Jordan, Baghdad
Hit the mall, tell Jamal, them Jordans, bag that
Envy in their hearts, real talk, and that’s preceded by a hashtag
These cats mad, let the heater spark
Fuck trust, even my own shadow leaves me when it’s dark
I leave it up to God but now it's on
Even when it’s my own at home
Muthafuck a Fredo Corleone

[Hook: Jason French]
Everything revealed in time
Envy that you kept inside
Me say, no don’t you go and try to hide
Cause you a fake muthafucka, fake muthafucka

[Outro]
A real recognize a real fake muthafucka
