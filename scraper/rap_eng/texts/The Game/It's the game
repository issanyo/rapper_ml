Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game

All in the wonderful game
That we know as love

You had words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game

Soon he'll be there by your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away

You had words with him
And your future's looking dim
But these things your heart can rise above

Once in a while he won't call
But it's all in the game

Soon he'll be there by your side
With a sweet bouquet

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away
