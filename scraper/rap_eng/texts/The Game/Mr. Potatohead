Theres no batteries in my back

50 ain't gangsta
Lloyd Banks ain't gangsta
Yayo ain't gangsta
Young Buck, you know you ain't gangsta

Look at what you niggas made
Ain't that a bitch
Created a monster
Kicked me outta G-Unit
Put me in converse
Matter of fact give me a dick
Just like Olivia so you can suck my shit
Gimme a pen
So I can be the hardest in the click
Wind me up nigga then gimme some lips
So I can talk about ya faggot
Niggas ain't no thugs
While im at it tell Young Buck gimme some white gloves
So I can cover my fingerprints in ya blood
I need a get away car you can put it on dubs
Make sure its got a stash for the 38 snub
And a Banks album cuz thats where I got my buds
Gimme muscles like 50
Gimme Yayo hands
Gimme a collection plate for Ma$e fans
Gimme some glasses so I can watch Mason dance
Who movin? You singing?
Nigga gimme ya fans
Gimme a tattoo tear
Gimme some ears so I can hear police talkin when you disappear

Yayo: And I'd like to thank game cuz hes mr potato head of the year, 'n' you kn.. a put together gangsta!

Rolling through Connecticut
In a stolen mini-van
Stop at his house
I dont see many men
Matter of fact I dont see any men
One plain clothed cop call him Lieutenant Dan
Officer why ya man tryna beat up my fans?
Makin me 5 times platinum wasn't part of his plan
Same shit same snitch
You know how it goes
I smell a rat even if you take off my nose
And I bet every quarter in your piggy bank
Lloyd told N.Y.P.D. who got 50 shanked
Next time when the lights go out
I'm pulling a desert eagle when the knives come out
Watch that man get ta tussling and the mice run out
Don't gamble with ya life when my dice roll out

I made you

Mr Potato Head I Made you!
Yes I Made you
Mr Potato Head I Made you!
I Made you!

50 ain't gangsta
Lloyd Banks ain't gangsta
Yayo ain't gangsta
Young Buck you know you ain't gangsta
