She got a fat monkey, camel toe
She Armenian, she call me daddy’o
She like it from the back, no patio
I’m from the 2 Live Crew, her daddy know
I’m fresh as fuck, no flat top
I got flip flops in that black drop
No green screen in my back drop
I got green things in my back poc’
I’m thuggin', welcome back Pac
I’m a mac nigga, no laptop

Don’t call my bitch no stripper, nigga

Amber Rose ain’t got nothin' on my life
Meagan Good ain’t got nothin' on Chyna

Shit Japan ain’t got nothin' on Chyna
Wish that was me, nuttin' on Chyna
Damn, there I go again
I ain’t tryna start nothin' by speaking nuttin' on Chyna
Don’t stop, poppin' it, she picked it up and she droppin' it
I like red bones, a little chocolate
And I’m ASAP with that Rocky wrist
And I’m swaggin' and splashin' and fuckin' these hoes
I’m blowin' that Kush and it’s stuck in my clothes
They blowin' my dick till’ I nut in they nose
These niggas they know they can’t fuck with the flow
My Mazzi is cold, my bitches is hot
We walk in the club, she sneak in the Glock
We turnin' it up, off of Peach and Ciroc
With bottles and bottles
Like when does it stop?
With models and models, they know they be fuckin'
She say she a virgin, I know that she bluffin'
I’m knocking the stuffin' out that English muffin
I turn on the oven and whooooo!

Coke boy, like O boy
Got a gold Impala like dope boy
Twerkin' it, workin' it
Like waffle house, I’m servin' it
They play with it, I’m murkin' shit
You jersey’s kid, I’m dunkin’ shit
You square niggas get your circle hit
And it don’t stop, what you twerkin' with
Don’t stop, what you twerkin' with
Don’t stop, what you twerkin' with
Don’t stop, what you twerkin' with
