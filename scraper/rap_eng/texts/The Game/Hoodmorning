[Hook]
Hood morning (x4)

[Verse 1]
No motherfuckin' typo
That's like Westside, Compton with no psychos
That's like Beverly Hills with no lipo
Fuck around and jack some, five- no Michael
Hello, a hundred thousand in the mattresses
Im Hollywood, yeah, I only fuck actresses
I'm in Cannes, France
You don't know where that shit is
SLR, thats where the ratchet is
Im in the Amber Rose rolls with Amber Rose hoes
Sorry Wiz, thats how the rap shit is
You can take it as a shot or free promo
But everybody in this motherfucker know I'm loco
Aaron Rogers aim, knock the man off your polo
Used to scare the shit out you niggas with my old flow
Post-documentary, Comptons most wanted
Finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
Finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
And roll up that OG kush, like motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me and Skee been doing this
Y'all had Snoop
I'll put the Piru in this
Look at all these fake ass bloods trying to ruin it
Everything red down to the 'Ye Louis kicks
And who is this?
With the all red crucifix
Navy blue Cardinals fitted, I'm a lunatic
Flow like the uzi spit
Hoppin' out the newest shit
Windows down, disturbin' the peace!
Bitch, I'm Ludacris
Used to be on the block moving rocks from 2 to 6
Jimmy Iovine money, I'm eatin' on some Jewish shit
Whips transform, Shia Lebouf my newest shit
Carmelo yellow Camaro 22's
And If a nigga run up, I'mma fuck dun up
I son your new rap niggas, I Peter Gun you

[Break]
West coast niggas got crazy game
When you get off the plane
Better guard your chain
Man fuck this shit
Mars tell these motherfuckers
