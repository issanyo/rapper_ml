[The Game]
Lets get back to some killa shittt {*echoes*}

[Chuck B. More]

(Chorus 2x)
Few times he been around this hood
If he ain't got a vest on, it ain't all good
And he ain't gon' swallow that slug
He ain't gon' swallow that slug

There's that clip, there's that(g-unit)crip(3X)

See my niggas in the hood hoppin out them lo-los
When they pull they gats out they ain't playing
So get your bitch-ass out the way or u gon get your crew laid down
When them hollow tips hit you, your chest start burnin
If you dont fall down my niggas keep sprayin
It won't stop till everybody dead, if not they circle around

(Chorus 2x)
Few times he been around this hood
If he ain't got a vest on, it ain't all good
And he ain't gon' swallow that slug
He ain't gon' swallow that slug

There's that clip, there's that(g-unit)Crip( 3X)

Hit yo switch on the '64, then pull the Glock out
Let the world know my clips extended
Take it back to P.A. in '89
When the JVM shut it downn
When i hear them sirens
Imma hit the switch slide off from seat ridin 3 wheel motion
(G-U N O T Another one bites the slug)

(Chorus 2x)
Few times he been around this hood
If he ain't got a vest on, it ain't all good
And he ain't gon' swallow that slug
He ain't gon' swallow that slug

There's that clip, there's that(g-unit)crip(3X)

And
Feed Them Bananas B-A-N-A-N-A-S (4X)
