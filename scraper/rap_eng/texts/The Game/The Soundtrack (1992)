Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
The soundtrack to the ghetto was "The Chronic"
The soundtrack to the ghetto was "The Chronic"
The soundtrack to the ghetto was "The Chronic"
The soundtrack to the ghetto was "The Chronic"

[Verse 1: The Game]
Maybe I should move a little, smoke a little
Fuck around, get high a little
Start reminiscin' about the old times
12 years old, cars drivin' by with gangsters in it
You ain't stand too long
'Cause you already knew that it was gangsters in it, nigga
Yeah when everythin' was copacetic
'Til niggas got off them 40 ounces
That's when even the Pope can get it
Chronic smoke all in the air, ain't nobody playin' fair
And Snoop Dogg had all these niggas
Around here tryna braid they hair
Red and blue, khaki suits
Us lil niggas got active too
From Lincoln Park, back to the Fruits
Us lil niggas had ratchets too
So what you sayin' nigga? We ain't playin' nigga
We kill your daddy and let your mama do all that prayin' nigga
Lose your fuckin' life when them

[Verse 2: The Game]
My mama was a gangster nigga
My daddy was just a gangster nigga
Wasn't for them, I wouldn't be from Compton
I should probably thank them niggas
Taught me how to shoot, rob, kill
How to shank a nigga
Maybe I should blame them for all these cases
When I done banked a nigga
AKs out of M3's, prostitutes on bent knees
Gun shots on Greenleaf, all these 64s, no Bentleys nigga
Euros on Cutlasses, you can't rent these niggas
'Bout to do a drive-by tonight, that's why we tint these nigga
Heard shots rang out, just ridin' on my 10 speed
Seen the windows down and the bitch squeezed
Nigga almost died tryna get some weed
So don't be fooled by the palm trees
This Compton nigga, that 310
That 213, we on Death Row
Ain't no one escape unless you D-R-E
And that's how I felt when them
