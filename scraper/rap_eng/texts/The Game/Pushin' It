[Verse 1: Game]
Remember Cam'ron' first year? Think it was horse and carriage
But I ain't talkin' marriage, I'm talkin' fourteen karats
I ain't talkin' Tiffany cause I ain't talkin' industry
I'm talkin' in the streets, twin Bentleys
I'm tryna be with you mentally before physically
Or physically before mentally, just remember me
For you I'd let that thing like a symphony
Sid and Nancy or Mickey and Mallory
Never been a trick, I do the shopping for both us
Send shots at these vultures in these Mark Jacob loafers
I'm sayin', you gon' let me see somethin'? Stop playin'
I didn't know it was like that goddamn
You bring the LL out a nigga
The Louis V, the Berkin and Chanel out a nigga
J12 out a nigga, so you know what time it is
I'm 'bout to call the realtor, yo ma, where you tryna live

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body
You're beautiful, vaginal
I'm pushin' it, back door
I wanna elevate ya to the top floor
I'm pushin' it, need a rush
The way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch

[Verse 2: T.I.]
What's happenin' mommy? What you doin'? You supposed to be
Livin' in the life of luxury so you should go with me
Overly excited, spend the night, I bet you like it
Do it however you like it don't matter, just don't bite it
You see that feeling you had when you met me, we you shouldn't fight it
It said you and I or more than worth a try, so don't deny it
See, I'm King like Leonidas, dress your hands with the brightest
Stones known to man when your man's pockets on a diet
Brought you in this presidential, out that double in the Hyatt
Big money talkin', all broke niggas be quiet
It don't matter how he feels, all that matters how he live
Don't listen to his opinion till he stack a couple mill
But until then feel free to come chill
In my crib in the hills sit back kick off your heels
You never seen a pad with a view so ill
Or receive so much pleasure that you couldn't hold still
Well until

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body
You're beautiful, vaginal
I'm pushin' it, back door
I wanna elevate ya to the top floor
I'm pushin' it, need a rush
The way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
Straight to the penthouse, elevate
Let me put my hands on your w-w-wait
Let me take a second, let me take it in
You can run that game all night, but you know I'll w-w-win
I'm superman, I'm super cool
I'm breathin' air all over you
I'm superman, I'm super cool
I'm breathin' air all over you

[Verse 3: Game]
I let your friends talk bad about you, I didn't kn-izzo
Behind your back callin' you a H to the izzo
I apologize, lay your head on my pillow
Mr. and Mrs. Smith and we can have a little Willow
She can shave the sides, put a couple lines in it
And we can have spritzers put a couple limes in it
Throw a Bar Mitzvah put a couple dimes in it
She go see a Drake show but never out of line with it
So every chance I get, nigga I'm in it
Deep sea divin' tryna see what I can find in it
So it's mine in'it, and that's a Porsche ain't it
So picture that and have Andy Warhol paint it
I'm a rude boy so I'ma go and get it up
Rihanna post Chris, Matt, Kim, baby this is us
So talk to me, have you ever been to Cannes
Yeah, south of France, next stop Japan
Let's go

[Hook: Robin Thicke]
Pushin' it, your lips
Cause my drug is your kiss
I'm pushin' it, your body
You're beautiful, vaginal
I'm pushin' it, back door
I wanna elevate ya to the top floor
I'm pushin' it, need a rush
The way I'm out on your body, the way your body touch
