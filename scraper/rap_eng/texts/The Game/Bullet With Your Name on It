[Hook]
I got a bullet with your name on it
You 'bout to have a hoodie with a motherfucking stain on it
Dashboard with your brain on it, motherfucking bitch
You worried bitch nigga, tell yo mama put a frame on it

[Verse 1: The Game]
Know it's murder, if The Game on it
Irv Gotti with the flame on it
I'm in the coupe, know the roof and it smell like Mary Jane, don't it?
Balmain crew neck, and Zanottis with the chain on it
Goddamn, I'm the motherfucking man
Tote drums like a motherfucking band
So fly, I don't know where to land
So fly, motherfucking Peter Pan
You put the city on your back like a motherfucking tat'
Damn nigga, you can stand where I stand
You can eat where I eat
I got a house on the beach but I run these streets
100 grand every week
10 mil in the safe, so you know where I sleep
Put a pillow by the combo
Bare arms like Mutombo
Ears to the street like Dumbo
High school on El Segundo
So you ain't gotta ask where I'm from though
Hit the corner on Cedar, polo beater
Run up on a nigga like pronto
Run up on a nigga like Wingstop
Lemon pepper wings when the motherfucking beam hot
Got the molly, got the white and the lean locked
Selling dreams on my grandmama grandpop

[Hook]
I got a bullet with your name on it
You 'bout to have a hoodie with a motherfucking stain on it
Dashboard with your brain on it
I got a bullet with your name on it
Know it's murder, if The Game on it
Goddamn, I'm the motherfucking man
Got a bullet with your name on it
Know it's murder, if The Game on it
I got a bullet with your name on it

[Break]
You know what the fuck be pissing me off?

We killin' air, we'll put bullet holes in clouds
Niggas gon' move when we coming down the block

[Bridge]
I'm a fucking alcoholic
I'm on Rosecrans & Central
In the Tam's drive thru
And I got murder on my mental
Lord please forgive me
Please forgive me
I say Lord please forgive me
Please forgive me

[Break]
You with the shit? Then you gotta show me you with the shit, nigga
Jump off that fuckin' stoop, hit the fuckin' gate, nigga
Grab your burners, it's time to go to war
Nigga, it's a block war, it's my motherfuckin' block
It ain't yours, yours, his, hers, it ain't nobodies but mine!
If you wanna stay on this motherfuckin' block, you standing behind me
And I grip this motherfuckin' trigger and I start giving it to niggas like UGH! UGH! UGH!

[Hook]
