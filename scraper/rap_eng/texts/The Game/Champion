[Intro]
Ay yo Cool
Tell Dre I been doing some thinking
Don't know how to say this
Hate it or Love it was whack!

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back, dressed in all black
Brooklyn dodger and that dinky hat
I'm a big dog, can't tame the cat
I'm a gangsta this ain't entertainment rap
You know the black Louis belt with a stainless hat
Crenshaw Boulevard where I'm famous at
No more sunshine cause the rain is back
Flow shady, bitches like I can't get black
I'm the dope game of rap, my dope game is back
My lyrics dress like Mos Def, I bring the 80's back
With one bar, I can change the way niggas think about me compared to say
A Jay, a Nas, a Cube, nah I'm too hard
I'm 2 Pac's and I still got drug money in that shoe box

[Chorus]
Champion, number one
Take your hats off and throw em' in the sky
You be fucking with a
Champion, number one
Take your hats off and throw em' in the sky

[Verse 2]
I'm like Tim Duncan dunking
Big pappy wanna see something
Home run, game is on one
Yeah I'm back in the black Air Force Ones
Jordan tagged on the back
Damn how the fuck Jordan do that?
Ask Barn Russell how the fuck Jordan do that
I'm a gangsta, nigga true that
Just moved outta Compton don't make a nigga move back
Yo Dre, where Cool at?
Tell him he can hate it or love but guess who's back
Bo know this, Bo know that but Bo didn't know Eli could beat the Pack's
Like Dre didn't know I could beat the rat
Knock em all out the car then break their backs

[Chorus]
Champion, number one
Take your hats off and throw em in the sky
You be fucking with a..

[Verse 3]
Boss hard no Dukes of Hazzard just a little Pac'n knife cutting through the mattress
Take the bricks out, put the chips in
Dance the track Pharrell, put the clips in
That's my life and The Vibe's a crip
But like my uncle Ray say when he drunk off a fifth
Talking shit, clean his Vietnam AK
You shoulda seen Joe Louis in his same thing
All rob B, Uncle Ray never seen Floyd Mayweather box on payday
Niggas don't want a box they stand
Niggas don't wanna floss, I stop, they stare
Come through with a drop so rare
A drop that hood niggas can't cop nowhere
You might as well throw your rocks in the air
I defy gravity and I stop it there!

[Chorus]
Champion, number one
Take your hats off and throw em' in the sky
You be fucking with a
Champion, number one
Take your hats off and throw em in the sky
