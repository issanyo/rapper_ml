[The Game]
Mother fuckers should have never turned my mic on

[Good Charlotte]
Oh
Oh
Say Whoa
This is a fight
Say here we are
Cause this is a fight

[Verse I]
[The Game]
You mother fuckers should have never turned my mic on
Out with the bullshit it's time for the fight song
Black hoodie, black Air Force 1s
A nigga with an attitude got a an airforce gun
Ready to get blood on my white tee
And a million mother fuckers feels just like me (just like me)
And I got shots to give
So will there ever be another 2Pac and big
Ain't nothing you can do to stop this shit
Takes the rappers lives (punk rockers live)
In the dark with no sunshine
When it's time for war we on the front line
Good Charlotte bringing the bass line

[Hook]
[Good Charlotte]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Dear, Mr. President)
Said here we are
This is a fight (a letter to the mother fucking government)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa
This is a fight
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Verse II]
[The Game]
From the hood to the trailer parks
State of course to the F for trading our american flags
For all black rags, cause to them we ain't shit
But welfare niggas and poor white trash
In American the fact is this
You're a soldier behind your back
You eject but spit
Yeah massive, also gotta rap for chicks
Know we outside the white house for bats and sticks
This is more that rhyming, this is mothers crying
And the first of free country why is war designing
Send my people to fight, when they don't know why theyre dying
This ain't a cry for help this is Bush resigning

[Hook]
[Good Charlotte]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Dear, Mr. President)
Said here we are
This is a fight (I'm writing a letter to the mother fucking government)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Bridge]
[Good Charlotte]
You gotta get up
Stand up
Just get up
Set up
Here we are (Dear, Mr. President)
You gotta get up
Stand up
Just get up
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Hook]
[Good Charlotte]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Mother fucker should have never turned my mic on)
Said here we are
This is a fight (Out with the bullshit it's time for the fight zone)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa (Mother fuckers should have never turned my mic on)
This is a fight
This is a fight
This is a fight
