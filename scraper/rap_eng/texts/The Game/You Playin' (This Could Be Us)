[Verse 1: Game]
This nigga walked in supper club with her so
She fuckin' the homie but that ain't none of my business tho
I'm with the business tho
I'm with my niggas tho
Won't catch a fade, but these niggas catchin' feelings tho
Ol' bitch ass nigga
All in the face of a rich ass nigga
"Oh Game can we take a pic ass nigga?"
I'll sock you on bloods cuz these niggas be thots too
Aye, who got the bomb pussy?
Tell the nigga that's Jayceon's pussy
We can be Christina and Tune or Lauren and my nigga Nip
Look around the room like damn!

[Verse 2: Problem]
Whaaat
Too high for the BS, P.S
Let her know quickly, special delivery
Watching for the pig feet, countin' this paper
Baller, baby come blow on this Laker (Whaaat)
Soon I smash Im on the gas
Ya man in the mirror I'm smashing through the glass
Thrashin' through that ass girl, (Girl)
Pop a pill and be goner than my last girl (Whaaat)
Bye bitch!
Play with a pimp, I'm losing not a tear
European stroke have you shoot like Vladamir or Monovich
A lotta dick have you screaming in a high pitch
Draws surrounded by water on some molly shit!
Problem
