[P. Diddy talking]
This is the remix
This goes out to the west coast
We got Game, E-40, and Loon
Bad Boy, Lets go

(Verse 1)
[The Game]
What up Ma, Come roll with gangstas
Bad Boy and Aftermath, The street banger
You know its Game when the NWA chain hang
And canary's flyin' around his finger
The remix, Ya'll done started somethin'
I'm bout to Von Dutch S dot Carter somethin'
So let me tell you about the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
I'm a gangsta ma, I'm into guns, rough sex
Khakis, and Air Force 1's, with Donald Duck checks
And I ain't gonna put a chain on ya neck
Unless the combo pertaining to sex
And you comin' out that Chamberlain dress
You can tell I'm gettin' brains from a vet
Goin' to New Jersey like I'm playin' the Nets
I'm just tryin' to get mines like Loon did it
So I copped a Maybach and put a living room in it, Yea

(Chorus)
[Kelis w/ P. Diddy adlibing and talking]
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need

(Verse 2)
[Loon]
Hey yo from east to west niggas lease the vest
That good old gangsta shit never cease to rest
Even though these rap niggas never seen no stress
You forced to be a boss, rock a mean old vest
A 40 cal. with a beam on that
40 thousand on the chain, Try to skeem on that
Send a team that'll lean on cats
Niggas trained to go to war like Marine on cats
With no Bush, No Puff, And no push
Nigga front, Nigga defintely end up in the oak bush
Yes, And all I do is lay up and smoke kush
Never stressin' you niggas, Niggas is so puss
So pathetic, Follow in dynetic
Die like diabetic, Die cause I said it
Die with five medics tryin' to pump ya chest
Die cause live niggas really want ya flesh

(Chorus)
[Kelis w/ P. Diddy adlibing and talking]
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need

(Verse 3)
[E-40]
Enough game to sell sand to an Afghan
Enough game to sell snow to an Eskimo
Its E 4-0, Dont get it twisted, I ain't racial though
I pull a hoe without a tug of war
You can find me in the local store
Young tycoon, E-40, Loon, and Game
We spit, We spit flame, gasoline, kerosine and propane
We get yay, But would never be a header
You can find me up in the Sean John Lincoln Navigator
Me and a few of my youngsters, A few of my runners
Outta her body, Out her window doin' a hifey
Ya'll tryin to walk it, We tryin' to run
We often ?? mix with that 18 hundred
Cali turtle blunted
Come on darling you know what gutty is, Go on with that
Dont try to act like you don't listen to rap
Dont try to act like you don't want me to tap
Dont try to act like you don't like it from the front and the back
How you want that

(Chorus until song ends)
[Kelis w/ P. Diddy adlibing and talking]
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need
