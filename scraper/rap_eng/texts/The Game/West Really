[Verse 1: Eastwood]
Yo, I'm Eastwood
South Central California where them chevy's ridin' high
Black and chrome y's on them 30 inch tires
Young'n movin' off the block
Tryin' stack that quarter in my ass crack
Pushin' up the block couple burners in my backpack
I been cheeked to the feinds I'm east snow the ryan [?]
The new west coast rap young Kobe Bryant
There is no raider, So don’t even try it [?]
You needa seize me to plan B, don’t take it private
This here ain't meant for y'all
Better switch your game up and watch your ego fall
Im fresh through the city
With semis to find a victim blowin' big
Dark tint In the Bentley worth every penny
I'm a boss, so pay me the game, I keep 'em with me
West coast Jay Rock and the game like west really
Eastwood when it comes to the flow I bet silly
We the city L.A
We the hood of L.A

[Hook]
We in the city of why's like what's up at my niggas in the projects
South central LA, we finna pop next
You rap cats and rapping the streets why
Compton California, we living the street life
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me

[Verse 2: Game]
Givin' it up for my Compton niggas
Watts killers
Englewood bangers
South central monsters
L.B.-C slangers
In that cutlass supreme on gold
Daytonas, my chopper ridin' shotgun
Nigga I'm sprayin' corners
Like e'r day e'r day
Three wheel motion down slawson
Niggas pay to see the game flossin'
Goin' off Me and J
Pourin' out liquor cause my nigga 2Pac can't see the day
Nigga tryin' to go platinum, I did that in '01
Bring your bitch around, I did that in '01
East, no the beast
"Mr. Fuck the police!"
Pull Glocks, bust shots
Nigga see me in the streets [?]
Got some nigga's the be truth up
Hop out of Lambo's wear strings and some new chucks
I am the LA streets
And if you know like i know
West coast niggas fucking with the bitch

[Hook]
We in the city of why's like what's up at my niggas in the projects
South central LA, we finna pop next
You rap cats and rapping the streets why
Compton California, we living the street life
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
They call watts finest, Jay Rock's my name
Runaway slave I'm so off the chain
Watts up to every tribe in the watts
Why spit it for y'all i hold it down for the block
Yeah call me Los-Angeles
The project's my campus
Find me on the block stackin' bread like sandwiches
Rollin in the Fleetwood
Wit my nigga Eastwood
Red and blue make green
Cali niggas, we eat good
Ese's ride wit me
Oh he's so loco
Throwin' up the W, leanin' like a cholo
Don't mean it? Trouble you
Hub in a dub in it
A party ain't a party
Till you got some bloods in it
Don't get it ruined
I fuck with my low goons
Big Snoop Dogg holla at your young haul
Roll it up it feels good to be high
Top dog gettin' chiefed west coast we gun ride

[Hook]
We in the city of why's like what's up at my niggas in the projects
South central LA, we finna pop next
You rap cats and rapping the streets why
Compton California, we living the street life
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me
And we do it for the whole city
West coast stand up, homie say it with me
