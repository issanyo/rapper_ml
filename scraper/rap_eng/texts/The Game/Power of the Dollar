[Verse 1: Franc Grams]
I'm from the hood where niggas get locked up for tryna profit shit
Skippin' school cause niggas need dollars way more than scholarships
Bug alot, moms ain't workin', searchin' for jobs and shit
Crack still high in demand, later for colleges man
Duckin', dodgin' the snitches givin' the whole truth
Same crew, run with them niggas I knew since '02
Only played the block for a minute, my phone blew
Be more excited for them rings from them bitches that give a pose to
Real niggas know
That money phone go off and, nigga, everything stops
And I tried to rewind steps of this hustler's mindset
Attempts to sidestep the regrets of this life, yet
It's hard, when seein' more from a night that you would get
Bustin' your ass all week for that little ass check
Now I execute this rap shit, fluently how I handle
In the streets, either crack or these beats, it's still Grams, soon
I'm the best new artist, no competition at all
Ain't seen the first this year since the drop of the ball, niggas
And one time for my niggas locked in the feds behind that paper chase, man
Hood HD, Dope Boy, G Boss, it's "Free You" 'til they free you, niggas
Power of the dollar

[Hook: Jus Cus]
It's enough to shape the world that we live in
Feel the pain of it, you feel the pain of it
Mama used to always tell me that it's changin' me
Oh, good Lord, the power of the dollar
Can't remain where I came, expect that
I ain't the same since it came, I accept that
I'll do anything, anything just to get that
Oh, good Lord, the power of the dollar

[Verse 2: Game]
It ain't nothin' but a Bentley to me
I done crashed 6 of them mothafuckas since Dr. Dre fuckin' sent it to me
Compton, nigga, game is elementary
Rappers die, rappers hide whenever they mention me
My bars poetic, any nigga can get it
Hardest MC on the West since Pac, Busta Rhymes said it
Gave that nigga a hundred bars my first night at the 'Math
Since then I had a hundred cars, spent a million in gas, what's up?
Aye Dre, go get the Porsche washed man
Here Chris, y'all turn up on these niggas one time (soowoo!)
Remember Boyz N The Hood, Cube sittin' on the porch?
Nigga always had game, whether the block or the court
Fat gold chain, Glock in my shorts
R.I.P. to Nate Dogg, he passed me the torch
And I remember that time, sippin' on my Hennessy
Takin' shots to the dome like we fuckin' Kennedys
Here's one to your memory
Yeah, here's one to your memory
R.I.P. to 2Pac, my nigga Eazy-E, niggas from the hood that made money
Power of the dollar, let's go

[Hook: Jus Cus]
It's enough to shape the world that we live in
Feel the pain of it, you feel the pain of it
Mama used to always tell me that it's changin' me
Oh, good Lord, the power of the dollar
Can't remain where I came, expect that
I ain't the same since it came, I accept that
I'll do anything, anything just to get that
Oh, good Lord, the power of the dollar

[Outro]
I can't take it, I can't take it
I'm just not the same no more
All this money, all this power
Just keeps takin' over me
Oh, good Lord the power of the dollar
Good Lord, the power of the dollar
