Some say a genius, California dreaming in the sun
He'll never make it. The odds are a gazillion to one
Overcame adversity and taught the world to sing along
Then he stayed in bed for three years
Now the feeling is gone from a beautiful song that's a permanent part of my head
When they prop you on stage put a smile on your face and pretend you're a beach boy again
Inebriated, Landy made your decisions for you
Exploited your illness, write a song for a bucket of food
When I needed inspiration you were always there for me
Now I have to change the station
Overcame adversity and taught the world to sing along in a three part harmony
