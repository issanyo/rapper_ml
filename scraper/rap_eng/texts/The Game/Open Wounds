[Verse 1: R-Mean]

A bit of mystery lies in history's eyes
Cuz in time the facts and the figures get twisted with lies
The devil tried to kiss us goodnight
But he hides
That's how a proven fact is simply denied
I am a victim - a victim of time
Victimized by the victory of viciousness the system revised
They say a century's passed - nothing can bring them to life
I say our memories last - at least admit to your crimes
I try to look these little kids in their eyes
As they're watching their mother's demise
She's cut - blood drips from her thighs
She was pregnant - they're ripping her stomach - it's slit from the sides
Just so they could guess on the sex of the kid that's inside
They had us walking and walk in the blistering sun
Sands of the deserts as far as our vision can run
They had us walking in circles - walk till we starve
Oh Lord, I hate 'em! - Forgive me, it's wrong but I'm scarred
They planted the seeds of hate in my heart - it keeps growing
My heartbeat's slowing
My heart just keeps hoping
Cuz we'll never - ever! - give up on our cause
Cuz we owe it to all the people we lost

{Verse2: The Game]

Lost souls
Broken families
Shattered dreams, I'm hoping you can understand me
When I say it hurt my heart to hear about the stories
How you take a million lives an do it all for the glory
The wounds still open, they might never heal
The human race is broken, it's time for us to reveal
That what they thought was lost is found, fully intact
Armenian resurrection, see it tatted on the backs of soldiers
Armenian flags hang on the side
Of Bently's and S5's
While they screaming "we alive"
Trump won't acknowledge what happened, so it's evident
We can't acknowledge a racist pig as our fucking president
