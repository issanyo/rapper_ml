[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story 'bout this bitch I know
Grew up on the Southside, sucking dicks for dough
Give her a half a dollar, she'll put on a show
Do anything to be in a Dr. Dre video
The bitch went Hollywood, one trip to the West Coast
She got fucked by this white bitch, had her legs wide open
As long as my pockets were fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
My pretty young thang, she keep my nuts drained
All the time she was plotting on my Aftermath chain
Bitch couldn't stay in here lane
Started running with this ho from the South, gold grill in her mouth
She put her on the track, gave her, her first thong
Introduced her to her two girlfriends from back home
Fucked the industry, tryna take the fast route
Ran into a gangsta and he turned they ass out

[Hook]
You gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
And I'mma always love my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
I be always fuck my bitch, my bitch, my bitch
She gon' always be my bitch, my bitch, my bitch

[Verse 2]
From the projects hustled all day
Niggas called her Sophie from around the way
Used to play hard to get, so they thought she was gay
Booshie bitch who ever thought she was raised in BK
Moved out the hood, changed her name to Jay
Told everybody she'll be working with a mill one day
I was introduced to her back in '96
She had a wavy haircut and some big-ass lips
At first, she was hard to hit
Come to find out the last ten years she been sucking Big dick
Got a family now, a house made of bricks
Four grown-ass kids and ain't none of them shit
She still my bitch so I stayed around
But she always tryna Dash when other Dame's around
She tryna play the Game, but I got the bitch number
She said she won't, but she'll be back next summer

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Last but not least, my gangsta bitch
From Compton always in and out of jail and shit
Bitch tried to burn Snoop, stole Chronic from Doc
Blew the whole West Coast, even tried to fuck Pac
Type of bitch to stand on Beverley Hills
Word on the streets, she got a few real niggas killed
I look up now she on my dick
Telling me how she always gonna be my bitch
Pop up at award shows always following me
Bitch doing dumb shit, got a college degree
No pre-nupt, one nigga got stick with her
I was smart, knew always not to fuck with her
What goes around comes around, scandalous shit
Somebody tried to kill that bitch
Burnt the bridges and ain't had one friend left
Niggas that know her called her the devil in that red dress

[Hook]
