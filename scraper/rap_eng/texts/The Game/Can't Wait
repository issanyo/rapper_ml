I got a bitch named Soo, I got a bitch named Woo
And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait, can't wait

And they twins, can't wait till I can fuck em' again
Can't wait till I can fuck em' again, can't wait

[Verse 1: The Game]
My little bitch named Soo', that's my Woo
She like to play hide and seek inside my coupe
When I pull up, she like to hop out the roof
And I put that on my hood, I love eveything that she do
She a cougar, she 38, I am 36
Bitch got bodies on her, yeah new dirty bitch
That bitch mean, always up in my jeans
And inhale fire, ain't no in between
She a ride or die bitch, I swear, swear to God
If you walk around with her gon' feel like in the mob
Yeah, this bitch married to the game
And I don't leave without her and a pocketful of change
We gon' get rich together
She's bi-sexual, we gon' fuck a bitch together
Sixteen in the clip', she got her shit together
This shit is forever
