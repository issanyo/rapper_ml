Just the other day, I...(X6)

[Verse 1: Game]
Just the other day, I saw a hologram of Eazy around my way
I started to pray, I hopped up in that Maybach
I know I said I wouldn't but sometimes a nigga gotta crossover like A.I
I crossover like Steph Curry, crossover like CP
But I will not crossover so niggas can buy the CD
This NWA ha, smokin' that Bombay, we stay high
Niggas is killin', we out the way ha
I think about the day I first met Dre
I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A
I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La
Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre
I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song "Hittin' Switches", then I recorded the shit with Faith
I did the BET Awards with Mary J
I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas

[Hook]
Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
Shout-out to the Bay, bruh
Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA
Where that Alize now?
Case a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side

[Verse 2: Game]
Shout to my niggas up in Wayside
Take these Amber Rose pictures, send up 'em the way
I love my niggas, especially in the pen
I hold you down if I never see you again
I put that on my kids
I sweat them blood tears
I trade places with you, and do some of your years
I confronted my fears
I roll up a fat one and disappear on the pier
I wish you niggas was here and
Just the other day I, was riding through the old hood
Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good
I understand I've been misunderstood
Niggas hate me cause they wishin' they could
Kill me, put my face on obituaries when I was just in they hood
Keepin' they bitches in missionary positions now look
Don't ever ask me about Dre I, been 100 with my nigga since the day I, signed to the Math and

[Hook]
Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
Shout-out to the Bay, bruh
Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA
Where that Alize now?
Case a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side

[Outro]
Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and I swear it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
And you ain't gotta ask you know where I'm from
Nigga don't ask you know where I'm from
