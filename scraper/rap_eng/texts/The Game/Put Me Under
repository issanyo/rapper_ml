[Intro: Game]
Don't worry about me
I ain't no body
I'm just gonna come sell uhh- 'bout 8 million
And then I'mma get the fuck ou t your way so you can go gold
I'm get all the way out the way hahaha
Bitch!

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Niggas got a V12 engine mouth 'till I bust that chrome
They screamin' like a bitch
When them hollow tips crush them bones
When I call 50, Banks and Young Buck is on
They bring heavy artillery when I chirp that phone
Grew up with the holy ghost went to church from home
Bad Boy since birth like Justin Combs
Been to the county jail once, it ain't feel like home
Promised to never go back if niggas left me alone
But the hood is the hood niggas hate to see me get money
So I cut the grass so I can see the snake niggas coming
They don't want me to be the best so I prepared for the worst
You got a Teflon vest? let me see if it works

[Hook]
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
But until the day I die, G-Unit gone ride
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
Hate all you want from your living room but don't come outside
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
If u wanna witness the album, come see it from ?
Niggas spend the rest of they life try to put me under
Try and I'll make you my bitch, nigga suck my dick

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Seem like every other city I go niggas is fake
Down bottom L.A. to uptown New York state
No disrespect to my fans I mean a nigga that'l shake your hand
Kiss your daughter on the cheek, snitch on you then take the stand
Nigga that live by the motto money make the man
He ain't gotta walk home the Sargent let him take the van
And Quik said dollaz' make sense
So I'mma interior decorate his Impala
Give 'em red tints
They ain't got those in 3-1-0
Or West Coast Customs fuck 'em and any who love 'em
I spend a million on bail thats nothing show me his hood
I'll crush him G-Unit get money and niggas gotta suffer

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - The Game]
Homie I'm scared I might have to take your life
So when the thangs come out you better run
Home I'm scared for the sake of my new born kid
Cause I might have to do life in the pen
Homie I'm scared to kneel down and wash away my sins
Try me and I'll do it again
Homie I'm scared I've been behind the trigger more than once
What's gone happen to me when God comes

[Outro: Game]
Ha Ha
Thats a big ass gun you got right there nigga
Look at this one though, you scared as a motherfucker right?
Haha, A'ight, say wassup to Sammy Davis bitch
