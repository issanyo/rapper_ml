[Intro]:
Bang
Problem: Whaat
DJ Drama: See me myself
Problem: Let me up in and I bet i'll make this thing bang
DJ Drama: Only time I'm really in the streets, is when you hear me on this fly shit
Problem: You know I'm from the hood, so all my homies bang
DJ Drama: I'll be at the studio but when it come to them streets, oh I got some niggas that'll go! Diamond Lane!

[Verse 1: Problem]
Sippin' on tequila
With some se√±oritas
All these hoes ratchet but they acting like divas
Come through speed, hoes all looking
Boy watch your threads, you'll get your life tooken
Goons ride like a roller, Push green like a stroller
Cold as Minnesota bitch hotter than Tacoma
Keep paper like folds
Who want the same thing?
Girl let me hit the thang-thang
Bet I make you bang-bang

[Hook: Problem]
You know I'm out the hood all my homies bang-bang
You know how I do it, all my shit bang
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang
Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang
And when I'm up in it you know it's goin' bang

[Verse 2: Bad Lucc]
I make that pussy go bang (bang)
She rode me like a train
I go crazy deep and it insane
Oh mama that bitch can't hang
I beat it like a case
She squirted in my face
She laughed when she did it
Until I swam in it
Looked her in her eye gave her everything she needed
I call that thing kunta because that pussy i defeated
Lucky lucky git
Baby let me warn ya'
I worked that body like some shit straight off of Pornhub
She lookin' crazy but I'm running California
In diamond lane dick straight up haunt ya'
Put that on your kids, you didn't run little mama she done
Told her sit on my face, better yet jump on this tongue
"Got 'em crazy, he shady" is what they say when he done
Make that pussy gangbang on the hood she the one

[Hook: Repeat]

[Verse 3: Game]
It's a reason why they put me last
Problem riding shotgun, Bad Lucc on the gas
Four pipes hangin' out the ass
C-Compton for real, you ain't gotta ask
That's the turf nigga, roll the grass
World star knockout king, nigga fuck or pass
Unless you bang what I'm banging
I'm repping Cedars put you in Cedars, don't look at my chain
I tell the waiter hurry up them guns is very us
Got my shooters in this bitch nigga Steph Curry(ed) up
Golden State Warriors is back putting hoes in your snapback clack like that
You ain't never met a muhfucker rap like that
Sold 12 million records still strapped like that
And niggas say they want a problem in the back
You ain't even know I had Problem in the blacklist

[Hook: Repeat]
