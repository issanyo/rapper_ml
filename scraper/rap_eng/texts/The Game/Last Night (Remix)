[Hook - Diddy]
Last night I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sittin' here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child

[Verse - Game]
Check the Range, check the watch
Check the retail on the Bentley hardtop
Half a mill, interior daffodil
You ever seen a car with so much mass appeal
Me and Diddy walk in the club
And make all the champagne glasses spill
We got the beams on the Glock, Patron on the rocks
The ice on the chain, the ice on the clock
Haters, don't quit your day jobs
See your girl in New York, I hit it like A-Rod
See your girl in L.A., I might just keep her
Take her to the Four Seasons
I roll around with your girl like she my .45
Show her what Kobe look like from courtside
Relax your mind, release your soul
Let me see if you can blow like Keyshia Cole

[Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away

[Hook - Diddy]
Last night I couldn't even get an answer
I tried to call but my pride wouldn't let me dial
And I'm sittin' here with this blank expression
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
