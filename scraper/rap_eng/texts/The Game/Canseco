[Interlude]
Pussy is a whole different aspect of life
Wars don' started from country to country, over they women
Pussy, is one of the most powerful thangs in the world
And a lot of people don't understand how powerful pussy is

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas feel like going off in this bitch
Just got a new crib and my maid’s getting lost in this bitch
Got 18 homes plus a nigga got a gang of green
I’m playing golf in this bitch
When you got enough payback for the Maybach
Nigga, they don’t even offer the six
Collard greens got me coughing and shit
So much money that I’m offering shit
On the yacht with the thot
First time off the block
First time on the dock
First time with Ciroc
First time seeing dolphins and shit
I rep B like Boston and shit
I be putting these niggas in coffins and shit
Keep on talking that shit and your torso gets split
Ain't no (?) no Queens
Nigga this ain't no Dream
Compton nigga spittin' like Jay'
Signed by Dre, ain’t no in between
I’ve got them Beats all in my home
I've got your bitch giving me dome

[Hook: The Game]
She in Chanel playing with them legos
I fly first class with that yayo
Them chicks is on steroids like Canseco
La familia been getting them pesos
Since 1800 like Cuervo

[Verse 2: DUBB]
Yeah, the fucking beast is woken again
No jump four-four blow like a snotty nose
And a opium lit
I expose from the hip so fast over fire like I’m roasting a pig
Scope focus in here so close I can probably hit a roach in the air
Dispose of his limbs
No trunk space left so the ocean it is
Oh shit it is
The nigga DU Dub so dope in the four door ghost and its his
Your bitch wanna roll with the kid
Go home and it's stroke stroke and (?) hoping for kids
And she out promoting trying feel the buzz from me
If my name was Kevin couldn’t get love from me
Niggas at the school couldn’t get a cuz from me
Back when smokers in the hood couldn’t get a dub from me
And these punk niggas loved money
School of hard knock take your lunch money
Uh, rap game now I'm here
Not even a proper bitch couldn’t (?) from me
At the spur of the moment
I will empty the clip you will think it’s the omen
I go Ginóbili
Put the euro on colors, this nigga don’t know me
Niggas ain't homies
Niggas ain't shit, bitches ain't either
Niggas they hungry
They verses take over this shit is easy
Niggas is leeches
That niggas said to me this verse a keeper
And so is my bitch
She look like a leo just wait till you see her

[Hook: The Game]
She in Chanel playing with them legos
I fly first class with that yayo
Them chicks is on steroids like Canseco
La familia been getting them pesos
Since 1800 like Cuervo
