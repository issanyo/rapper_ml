[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
See, ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known 'cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
"Juicy" had us feeling like we was from New York
And that's real shit blazed the Philly
It's summertime shout out to Will Smith
'cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks?
My nigga Nas told me money make the world go round
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for Love LA
He from Queens, how the f**k he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

[Chorus]
And ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known 'cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Public Enemy and N.W.A is on my boombox, had to say
Yoday was a good day, had the hood buzzin'
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothin'
Everybody's first bootleg was Boyz 'n the Hood
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood
When the cars ride by with the boomin' system
Two door Mustang and the roof was missing
Every girl at ya school had the new extensions
Even gangstaz was dancin' like New Edition
'cause the house parties stayed rockin' all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright
'cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with OPP, then bring Naughty in
They say it never rain in southern California, Tony Toni lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus]
And ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known 'cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Verse 3]
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say WHOA!
Every thing full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name:
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talking 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

[Chorus]
And ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm making it known 'cause I just want the world to know
I'm paying my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin' homage 'cause you've paved the way for me, yeah

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
See, Mary J. I want you to understand you paved the way (for me)
I'm givin' homage (to you)
