[Verse 1]
I am one with the moon, the 54 platoon
Where bean come and soon
Trade out of the ... along, only wind that blows in the winter, the placenta
The danger, the marijuana, keeps me lifting like the sting, the
So I ponder, Niki Bees or Bill Honners, the other day I've seen my mama
Dipping in my danger, I sad what are you doing?
She blamed Obama, presidential Rolexes, presidential sweets all night switchers
It's kinda like a picture with no paint, blank
Like the mind of a dead man
And bitches are sweating me like Hellen Ireson's head bang
Drip after drip, I drop the phantom top, no Mariah
But I can be fire my can is hot as a Californian summer on your ace and a Hummer
This is game spitting flames with Andre 3000 numbers

[Hook]
Love birds, love birds me and my rose phantom are
Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are
Love birds, love birds, me and the palm trees are love birds
Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are
Love birds, love birds, me and the atl are
Love birds love birds, me and my microphone are love birds

[Verse 2]
I introduce the to your smelling, chronic bushes that are larger than African elephants
Relevant is my kush yours is not so stop pretending it's from a Californian spot
I am so high, it would take the white to snatch me out of the sky
I am flying and your career dying
I should get my best kaky suit out of the closet and put the iron to it
Reminiscence back when I didn't have a kaky suit to cruise on
Kept it moving, now I brawl like Patrick Ewing, junior ask baby
Before he met me I was sicker than a tumor and I had a Glock that do
Bullets like boomer, had niggers running faster they're running back
On a Oklahoma sooners, no sooner I said it I was sweated by my baby mama, the first one, drama

[Hook]
Love birds, love birds me and my rose phantom are
Love birds, love birds, me and my marijuana are
Love birds, love birds, me and the palm trees are love birds
Love birds, love birds, me and the Cadillac are
Love birds, love birds, me and the atl are
Love birds love birds, me and my microphone are love birds
