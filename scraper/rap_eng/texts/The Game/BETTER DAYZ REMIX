Been holding this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh Lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me away,away
Far away, to better days

We got a new president and I love that he black
But I'mma ask him like Bush "Where the soldiers at?"
Now move the camera to New Orleans "Where the soldiers at?"
The water dried up, well nigga do the nollya clap
We all juvenilles,we all been through some trials
And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'
What do I say next, should I talk about some cars?
Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
All my bullet wounds and my stab wounds
I can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos
I can't do nothing but spit the truth
On probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth
You makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking
I make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking
One minute you here, next minute shit is tragic
And this a Jim Jonsin track now feel the static

I sit here reminiscing and I hope you listening
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
When he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?

I'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse
And somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse
Tell me who inside it, Who's son is that
And how he get there, now tell me who gun was that
I ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch
But if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch
I'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked
And kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots
But at least they got the Dre Beats
Cause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet
And I seen it with my own eyes
At the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes
Can you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin
You can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother
They lost they baby daughter, and she was only three
She never got a chance to blossem on the family tree
