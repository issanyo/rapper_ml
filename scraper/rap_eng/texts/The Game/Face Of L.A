[Intro: The Game]
I thought I leave you niggas wit a little something to play with
While I finish my fuckin album
Everybody wanna know when the fuck my album comin out
Whenever the fuck I drop it
Wait...

[Freestyle: The Game]
Here the breakdown before I tell y'all who I be
I gotta say Proof R.I.P that's for Em
The 40 ounce spillin' that's for him
I got the system in the bently on blast for him
I go bananas like plastic timbs and my lyrics go over a niggas head like a new era brim
And I bang like a new era brim
Translation: a brim is a blood, like me a mac 10
Any nigga want the drama I reach for the mac 10
Make the fitted cap spin till it peel back skin
Eazy baby you don't wanna belive me baby
Yeeeeaahh like jeezy baby
L.A. on my face the logo from the Dodger brim
I'm the face of L.A. you gunna see alot him
The niggas behind me u gunna see alot them
Enough niggas behind me to fill up every room at the Ramada Inn
A&R's at the label like "not again every time we put a nigga out Game slaughter them"
Catch you in the alley what you gunna do without ya man?
Feel like I'm bishop standing over Radamans
You niggas bitches throwin rocks then hide ya hands 'till I chew yo ass up like Flintstone vitimans
I smell pussy somebody let the cats loose
I'm the drama king you'd think I found papoose
Who's next to put on the rat suit?
I fuck 'em doggy style you can go ask Snoop
While I bump this Mobb Deep in the caddilac coupe haha
Nah I really like track number 2
So I put a 100 bars on it you couldn't make my freestyle whack if you put chico debarg on it
I'm so hard homie, I swear to god homie, 50 Cent'll still bet his fuckin black card on me
Be cool cause when the heats drew, them hollow tips'll fuck up ya stomach like seafood
My niggas hungry when they look at you they see food
Give it up or I see you in the ICU with a bed and some IV's too
Nursery teachin' yo ass how to chew
Fuck this rap shit nigga I got a shoe
Next color on the shelf is North Carolina blue
I'm gettin' married she from North Carolina too
But you won't catch me in the North Carolina blue
If you see me in Riley just slidin' through throw your rags in the air like North Carolinens do
Before you run up think about what you're tryin' to do cause the 12 gauge eat niggas like parinah food
On my son I push ya head backwards cause I'll never ever ever be the next dead rapper
I'd rather be alive pushin some 2008 shit cause you gotta be dead in a box to be somebody's favorite
I ain't sayin' I'm about to go where Ma$e went
But you won't find me upside down on the pavement
I'm behind the desk on some Jay shit
Some niggas don't want me to shine, can you say snitch?
Black Wall Street niggas hop out and spray shit AK spit, give that mayback a face lift
Now back to the basics, my flow so amazin'
If this was 88 and I could rap I'd weigh you out like A6
Weigh you out like that ugly ass bay shit
Funny ass jackets got the hood on some gay shit
Them look like Nikes with stars on 'em, face it
The whole world blind, everybody on that race shit
Roll a blunt and get higher then a spaceship
Touch The Sky, nigga I'm on that Kanye shit
Back in the day I used to bump Jaz-O
Run up on you take ya money and ya skateboard, I was a asshole
Now I blast 4, leave 'em on the grass swole
Kickin and Pushin' like Lupe Fiasco
I got a jab like Floyd even ?zab no?
Try to Play The Game get punched out like Glass Joe
Hip-hop cops on my dick hit the Ave slow
Mad cause I get love in New York like DiMaggio
Brooklyn niggas say my flow nuts like pistachios
See me in the 64 wonder why the ass is low
I got the bricks in it, that real yayo
That Tony Montana drop the shit off the Pedro
I buy guns but the tons, bullets by the case load
We can find Osama when I say so
I got niggas flyin' in from San Diego
That'll smoke the town turn it into wako
Come through give ya whole hood a make over
Sit on yo block in the bullet proof Range Rover
Make you fade to black and I ain't Hova
Think about that will be before you say The Game over

You know I usually talk a lot of shit at the end of my mother fuckin' freestyles
But it ain't nobody else left to beef with....
