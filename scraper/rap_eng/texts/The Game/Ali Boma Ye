[Verse 1]
From Dekalb County, to Cobb County, from College Park to Riverdale
Been in the same spot since the Mid 90's, born on the block, and still there
Haha but I moved once in KCMO where I lived where
Anybody risk their life if they walked a block kids chopped and killed there
My best friends all walked different paths in the past just to get them ends
Did them sins, but I can't even judge em cause out in the public gotta get defense
From rock bottom to Hilltop, to Montgall 45th block
From ACE high I was laced high ready for warfare if I get shot
Now back to the A, where after a day
Meet a girl that'll burn and cat with a K
My fear died when I had the gat to my face
And my friends ran back to the track meet and stayed
But hey that's my generation, 90s baby I'm proud of that
I looked at the barrel with a smile on said "it's whatever I'll be back"
My life would've ended, like a stupid typical nigga
Not even from vengeance just to get back at my friends and
I stood fearless, my generation has raised me
Desensitized and complacent with living as simply basic
The childrens became the victims the parents became the brainless
The teenagers are fickle the 80's becoming ancient
I didn't get sad from hearing of newtown killing of baby's
I didn't cry when my friend went and killed himself and his lady
In front of his children, I was bout there age when we were rapping
Mom told me bout sandy hooks I responded it happens
Can't be too forgiving
Or remorseful lost life has become normal

[Verse 2]
Tape deck with a Play Rec I overwrite your EP
With these overnight celebs, my grind been over flight its CP
And that's over life, or a way of it
Hold the mic, made a plate of it
Dolemite with a Stolen mic
Made of gold I'm like Rudy Rays cousin
Frame em quickly, like grandma frame a picture from Christmas
Never let him out of sight, he's witness
And gotta stick of dynamite this business
Too big of voice too many Listen wouldn't wanna nigga to make a difference
That's why every one who was moving millions seems to die right before they finish
Power is estimated too low like they excavated
Pseudo story of rappers, so I'm pluto if my escapade is too low
Get it? I'm greatest who knows Mid 90's baby I'm howling at
That call me crazy but out in days I got my label that's that louder pack
But I'm not a rapper bro my laughter shows I'ma hell of an actor though
With my hands on these rappers throat, And a pen of that antidote
Evacuation the buildings vent vaccination to kill em
Or affirmation I'm willing to trash all the brains of children
Chao pack of million, with the tracks so real you can feel it
And hooks resemble Ali we confident when we kill em
Narcissist they ego say yolo is what the motto is
But I can live twice in one life I'm Sean Connery
And I can give monopoly competition when product is missing
That's economics my reputation beside a biz
Rise like a mesopotamian or Mariah's kid
Make songs my rise makes you question who raps messiah is
Violins mixing in with violence and sirens
The irony is I can be the meanest or nicest kid
The silence can be something with meaning or sibilant
Or it can be me vibing on lyrics I haven't written yet
I view a couple living vets who sold their soul to get a check
And now their check is gone and in the game they'll never get respect
Been in the middle of a war, city of the morgue
Kids selling MJ stealing from the store
Shells on the playground skin feel em more
Jumped in till the end been since he was four
That's me in the matrix, 90's babies the honoree
Chao Bomaye Ali kill em all, I'm on in 3-3-3 2-2 1
Sick tracks I'm startling delicate rapper targeting
With six straps of hard and see
Excrement slaps the floor while they flinch back and tottering
That's the difference between the prey and the wolf who gobbles them
