Breakin Rules (Feat Busta Rhymes)

[Busta Rhymes - Chorus]
Now put your hands up
Baby I wanna see you move
If you wanna get it poppin than show me just how you do
You can either give me head or fuck my whole crew
If you into breaking rules than listen to what you do
[The Game]
So put your hands up
Nigga I wanna see your jewels
If you never met a gangsta I show you just how we do
If you blink or move you on the 9 o clock news
I’m riding with flipmode
You ain't fucking with my crew

[Busta Rhymes - Verse 1]
Being that gangsta nigga game tied
Combine a great mind with Dr Dre outside the club
You form a great line
You not a thug you ain't even in the club nigga
Roll up in the spot with a bunch of ceder block blood niggas
Scud missiles launch, holla like a bud nigga
Don’t stop, make the bitches follow (?)
While you ponder on my moves
Shit is kinda strange flipmode aftermath bank account number change
Since day 1 nigga east coast stompin
Game told me come through take a lil trip to Compton
The way they live around here the shit is evident
They do how like we buy weed down on (?) on President (Westside)
Same hood shit homes
You know we do it proper
At the Vibe award my Ratchet woulda really repped the Doctor nigga
Look close you see the damage I’m bringing
Aftermath nigga thats the band Im swinging

[Chorus]
[The Game]
You think you got a nigga shook right
What you look like
In the club only Yankee fitted with a red light
Look left look right
Nigga we don’t tuck ice
Me and Busta Rhymes shine like Diesel truck lights
Styling with my chucks on
Gold chain plus stones
On the stores track I run the city like Puff Combs
And ever since they put Buss on
We be dropping gangsta shit while my competition making love songs
I got no problem watching Snoop getting his cuz on
Thank Jimmy Iovine for letting me put the buzz on it

They say I’m borderline disrespectful
I tell em suck my dick long as my wrist and neck glow
I put chicks on xo then show em the breast stroke
Hurricane game I splash and let her legs go
Far as my checks go got cribs in escrow
In three years flat Im crowned king of the west coast

[Chorus]
[The Game]
Im bout the only rapper that ain't been jacked
How was that? cuz I pack that mack
Don’t make me clap cuz I going off yack
On a Scott Storch track
So sniff these lines while I chop that crack
You can sip that surp while we flip these birds
B stars flipmode thats what you heard coming out that trunk
I pump that base with a red bandana tied around my face
And a Louie V belt wrapped around my waist
Im so ridiculous, ignorant thats just how I was raised
Inconsiderate, belligerent and niggas would say
I ain't finish another album without f-ckin with Dre
He can’t finish Detox without f-ckin with me
Cus I’m young and I’m sick and I’m CPT
And I’m dumb and I’m rich niggas can’t see me
With red beams on the S-C-O-P-E

[Chorus]
[Singing]
B Stars and Flipmode, flipmode
B Stars and Flipmode, flipmode
B Stars and Flipmode, flipmode
B Stars and Flipmode, flipmode
