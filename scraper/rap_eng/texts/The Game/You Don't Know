[Verse 1: The Game]
Tryin' to dive up in it, work on my back stroke
She tryin' to feed me with it, you know how that go
She said go easy with it, stay out the back door
I nigga went Yeezy in, North West tho
Nigga wanna talk about money let's talk
Nigga wanna talk about guns, where the chalk
Nigga wanna run around like he's sellin' records [?], 5 million, [?]
Nigga nigga ain't know, nigga nigga ain't know
Nigga nigga ain't know, nigga nigga ain't know
Nigga nigga ain't know, nigga nigga ain't know

[Hook]
You don't know, you don't know me nigga

You don't know, you don't know me nigga
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know me nigga, you don't know me nigga
You don't know, you don't know me nigga

[Verse 2: The Game]
Wanna talk about cars, then I pull out the Aston
Run to Tom Ford, then I pull out the plastic
Ridin' with a ratchet, totin' that rachet
Murder that pussy nigga, pull out the casket
Million dollar check, nigga I ain't gotta cash it
Million round' my neck, nigga I ain't gotta flash it
Smokin' in the white house, I ain't gotta ash it
Never rolled a blunt, that's my white boy hash it
You ain't know
You ain't know, I fucked your bitch before you got your deal
You ain't know, you ain't know (Ratchets, is still eatin' happy meals)
You ain't know, you ain't know
Motherfucker I'm Pablo, in the all black Diablo
Rockin' chain's like a nigga from Chicago

[Hook]
You don't know, you don't know me nigga
You don't know me nigga
You don't know, you don't know me nigga
You don't know, you don't know
You don't know me nigga, you don't know me nigga
You don't know, you don't know me nigga
You don't know me nigga
