[Chorus]
Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

[Verse 1]
They left his body swangin' down in Piedmont
At a Klan rally the day before, but that ain’t mean nothing
What they say "a suicide", I say it's genocide
Hey what you got a gun for? Boy you ain’t finna ride
They run up on you like Baton Rouge, bet you finna hide
That's the difference 'tween us, I'll die to save a million lives
Appointed leader when nobody couldn't think of shit
I'll be a martyr if my great grandaughter benefit
They pull you over, ask you where your license at
Be careful reachin' for it, you know you can die for that
And this ain't nothin' new, just got cameras so you can see the shit
Got Dr. King and Abe Lincoln askin' where the freedom at
This ain't no equality
Man you ain't have no justice on your mind when you shot at me
But fuck it, this the way it gotta be
Hey listen, you won't shoot at them then shoot at me?
Boy you are not a G
Imagine Trayvon askin' why you followed me
Feel threatened, hit him and whip him, that’s when he shot him down
Do that to a grown fuckin' man, drop where you stand
Tell my grandma go on with all that prayin'
If it's a God and he in the sky, he looking down, he understand
I'm just a man, and I'm wrong for revenge
But I don't get 'em it's like tellin' him to gon' kill again
Keep fucking around, it’s going to be on in a minute

[Chorus]
Boy we livin' in a war zone
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

[Verse 2]
This goes to the white boy that ran in the old church
I hope you get slow murked, and they torture you slow first
Ran in our place of worship to slaughter our grandma
Won't go kamikaze for that, well what would you die for?
Hold up... I'll wait, I'll wait
Heard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate
The war on drugs was just a war on us
Give us all these guns, give us all this dust
Change all them laws, lock all of us up
Went from Freeway Ricky, on to BMF (free Meech)
Then hip hop came, that's when we got rich
Cause white kids gravitated to it like all us did
And that's when they got slick
Invented the technology to take our shit
Diluted all of the artistry
Pardon me, somebody tell me what happened to Alton
Sterling, killed Philando right in front of the girl
And the world saw
Everybody's reaction was, "Hell naw"
This modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded
And the jig's up
The Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper

[Chorus]
Can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
Guess you don't notice when you livin' in it
Like every weekend it's a man down
Ain't got no pity for the innocent so I'ma represent it
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?

[Outro]
