"Yo, who go the juice now man?"
Niggas know how I get down for sure
I'm not soft
I'll blow your fucking top off
Niggas know I do dirt
I'm kicking up dust puttin' in work
Niggas know how I get down for sure
I'm not soft
I'll blow half of your top off
Niggas know I do dirt
I'm kicking up dust putting in work
Ye, ye, let's get it in
I got the 38 magnum
Rollin' in the magnum
Top down, I'm hot now
Niggas tryin' to bag him
Cops tryin' to harass him
Dual exhaust tail pipe
Smokin like snoop dogg
Four door coupe dog
Blow the fucking roof off
In the club, in the car
Sang dang chain hang
Bitch I'm a super star
It ain't who nice
It's J U Ice
And bitches cry when they see me like the passion of christ
My flow hit hard like busta
Staggerin' mic
And my niggas throwin' patron shots
Back at the fight
And that's word to eazy
Nigga pass me a light
I'm five mics plus one and thats a classic a'ight?
Yeah, I'm a z zone
Cooler than the ac on
Ask around barber shops couldn't fade me holmes
Bitches think I'm young hollerin'
When maybe roam
And I'm ghost liek the nigga who put jay-z on
And by, reasonable doubt
I'm the dopest nigga out
I ain't sold one record and I'm the dopest nigga out
I used to bang mackaveli at my grandma's house
And every rapper in the wolrd hate me like steve stout
I got, gorilla flow, throw of manila though
Like ali and foreman this is just a warnin
45 in the air to give niggas a warning
Take two of these and call me in the morining
Cleaning up hip hops mess is my job
Nigga, i'm from arizona where they say "FUCK HOT ROD!"
Be easy nigga
Hear you talkin' all breezy nigga
Fourth easy nigga
Better believe me nigga
You know my steezy nigga
I have you stuck in the trap like jeezy nigga
Killin' you is too easy nigga
You a myspace gangsta, profile look cheesy nigga
Everything you gots mine believe me nigga
I'm in your friends list stealin all your breezes nigga
You can't see me nigga
But when you see me nigga
I am throwing shit like matt monicks this season nigga
