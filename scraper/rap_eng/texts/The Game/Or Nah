[Intro: Too $hort]
Don't fight the feelin'
That's right, don't fight the feelin'

[Verse 1: Game]
Say my life is like a movie, nigga fuckin' every day
Fuckin' every day, nigga fuckin' every day
Say my life is like a movie, nigga fuckin' every day
Missionary, doggystyle, nigga fuckin' every way, go
I'm not the nigga you thought that
That trickin', we off that, I hit that, no callback
She ratchet, I like it, I hold it, she bite it
She lick it and suck it, I fuck it, he wife it
No feelings for a ho, that ain't my main thing
My niggas on the same thing, all my niggas gang bang
Bitches do too, this is my boo
Two C's on that bag but she throw up Piru
And we off that Cîroc, she don't mind if I do
Her girlfriend a thot, tell her hop in my coupé
Tell her hop in my bed, tell her hop off my roof
My baby mama trippin' and that bitch can shoot but

[Hook: Game & King Marie]
You gon' let me hit or nah?
Can I get the dick or nah?
You gon' let me watch you strip or nah?
Can a bitch get a fit or nah?

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh nah, so let me hit it
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh girl, so let me hit it

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
If you let a nigga come through
I'm give it to you better than you ever had it
Girl, I promise, I'm a be the only thing you want to do
Makin' you forgot about your niggas automatic, you already know
I can fuck you better (beitch!)
Can we live together?

[Verse 3: Problem]
It's a problem, bitch you better follow me
I give you this dick, you hit the lottery
I know all the stars, astrology
Last deposit fucked up the whole economy
Gettin' it, spent twenty-ten pitchin' it
Kush, piff in it, every white string infinite
You different, last night, niggas picturin'
Seven times, had a black chick tryin' white shit
Federline, I’m the future, real beef, I’ll shoot you
Walk-walk, no talk-talk, no sub and no woofers
It's on (on) tell by my tone (tone)
Real nigga call, better answer your phone
Beitch!

[Hook: Game & King Marie]
You gon' let me hit or nah?
Can I get the dick or nah?
You gon' let me watch you strip or nah?
Can a bitch get a fit or nah?

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh nah, so let me hit it
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh girl, so let me hit it

[Verse 4: AV]
You gon' be a nigga bitch or nah?
You gon' let a nigga hit or nah?
What you sayin'? Know you're with it so why you playin?
Bitch you better fuck a rich nigga while you can
I be on one, two C's for the city
I'm on, I got Crip and Blood niggas with me
Wait up, just tell me you with it and let me get it
Baby you can skip the bullshit and let me hit it
Three pills down, got me rollin' like Nip
Keep playin' games but you know that you a flip
Hold up, bitch quit playin' and give it up
You gon' let a nigga hit or what? What's up?

[Hook: Game & King Marie]
You gon' let me hit or nah?
Can I get the dick or nah?
You gon' let me watch you strip or nah?
Can a bitch get a fit or nah?

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh nah, so let me hit it
Girl once you get it, you got it forever
Oh girl, so let me hit it

[Outro: Too $hort]
Don't fight it baby, don't fight the feelin'
You know a nigga tryna fuck
I like that bitch, yeah baby
Your pussy wet? Take them panties off
Don't fight it, let a nigga hit that shit
You like to fuck? All these bitches love fuckin'
