[Intro]
Baby, baby
Baby you, baby

[Verse 1: The Game]
Baby you know you got me goin' crazy
You run around my head like these waves
Yeah baby you, you know that you the one that I adore
The one I introduced to Tom Ford at dinner
That was you, you'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with but now you on some fuck shit
Anybody but you
I ain't figured that you would be the one to cut me
Leave me on the floor fuckin' bloody, God damn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds givin' these hoes time
Girl, baby you, I can't blame you though
When you see the door, you see the door
Now listen, baby you

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be, thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one to make me feel unsatisfied, no, uh
But baby you, you got me going, uh
But you got me going, you got me going, uh
But you got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh

[Verse 2: The Game]
Tell me how you think we livin' how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't gettin' money for these shows
I guess you think I'm trippin' on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win 'cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did, I'm a real nigga, I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye, arguin' all the time
It's just you, I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it 'cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it somethin' we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singin' shit about you

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be, thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one to make me feel unsatisfied, no, uh
But baby you, you got me going, uh
But you got me going, you got me going, uh
But you got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me, yeah
You got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me
Baby you, yeah, oh

[Verse 3: Jason Derulo]
Blood is money and I spent it on ya
Ain't it funny how it ended, oh yeah?
You said you'd go down for the last time
But we both know it's not the last but I saved mine, uh
Long as you going down
