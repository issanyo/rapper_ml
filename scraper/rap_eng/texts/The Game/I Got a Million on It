[Intro: Game]
Ahh shit
G-G-G-G-G ... G-G-G-G-Unit
I thought all that beefin was over man
Squashed it man, been there done that
Somebody had to gon' on and fuck it up

[Game]
No more Bleek and Buddens I was hopin' for silence
Till the little sleeping beauty, went and woke the giant
This little bitch from The Luniz wants beef, he's lying
So I called E-40, and tried to seize the violence
I got niggas on the island, for puttin' in stainless work
With vaseline on they palms, gettin' ready to Bang Em Smurf (you little bitch)
I here him screamin' in Compton, sound like my bitch cummin'
You wasn't never fuckin' with G-Unit, quit frontin'
For Domination be Lisa Leslie, a big woman
With a nine on the back, I'm gonna catch that bitch runnin'
Shove a .40 in his throat, now nigga spit somethin'
And get lost boy, go visit your big cousin
I got fish to fry, throw a line in the pacific
With cocaine on the hook, for this Luniz ass nigga
You a bitch, how you call your self the Ice Cream Man
When Master P took your name and your ice cream van
Made 500 million, that's your homey though
Took your man hood, gave your shit to Lil'Romeo
This nigga, 5 foot 2, talkin' that big shit
You Got 5 On It? that money went to Chris Hicks
Tryin' to diss Too $hort for doin' his pimp shit
Nigga you been gitten fucked, swallowin' big dicks
Pac knew he was a pussy, that's why he ran south
Signed to Rap-A-Lot, they never put his ass out
Hid behind Lil' J, all the sudden you thugged out
Ran back to the Bay, sleepin' on wannabe cuz couch
How you drop 5 albums, don't own one house
Or get the boss to call me, Banks, and Buck out
It's G-Unit bitch, let me show you what blood bout
When my blood pressure rise, I bring the bloods out
Put the barrell on his neck, blow his guts out (*gunshot)
Now that's whats you call a Yukmouth

[Outro: Game]
Yeah, you little faggot ass bitch
Yeah nigga, on the motherfuckin' internet with that faggot ass footage nigga
You little bitch ass nigga, Domination, nigga
I'll put braids in your hair motherfucker
See how you like when it's motherfuckin' 50 Cal, nigga
Blow your motherfuckin' brains out nigga, i'll braid your hair you little bitch
Back to you nigga, nigga with the dreads, you fuckin Jafakin
Motherfuckin' faggot ass nigga
Yeah I seen you in the club nigga, asked you did you had beef with G-Unit nigga
Nigga you ain't say shit nigga
"That ain't me man, that was C-Bo, man, this Regime, this Regime, man, Bay area, Bay area"
Man i'll beat the shit out you, you fuckin little punk
And when I catch you nigga, you gonna need Dr.Dre to get my motherfuckin' G-6 out you ass
You bitch, you faggot ass nigga, and don't try to turn the Bay 'gainst me nigga
I got niggas in your town that will fuck you up
Vallejo, Filmoe, San Fransico, Sac-town, Oakland
Compton's most nigga
G-G-G-G .. G-G-G-G-Unit
Thought I was done huh? you little bitch
I ain't finished with yo' ass yet nigga, when I see you I'mma beat the shit outta you nigga
To a motherfuckin' pulp, on camera nigga
Since you like playin' with little camcorders and shit you motherfuckin faggot
And I got a mill on that, what the fuck is 5 dollars nigga
G-G-G-G-G-Unit
