[Hook: Game]
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Verse 1: Game]
It ain't nothin' like that purple haze or that chocolate Thai
Switchin lanes with my knee cause I roll it while I drive
And I be blowin that sticky green out the S5
That California kush increase these bitches sex drive
I know that, so I be rollin' up the best lye
Open my sack niggas can smell it down in Bed-Stuy
In LA, niggas they say my shit is that good
In New York, niggas be rollin' up them backwoods
Niggas crowd around me for miles to see me roll up chronic
I take the 'belve with the goose and mix it up with the tonic
I can't see her through the smoke but I can tell that she want it
Take two puffs and pass wake me up in the mornin'
Cause' there ain't nothin' like smokin' while you gettin' some head
Break it down on the chronic album call it breakfast in bed
So mary jane let me know if you wit' it
They say weed is like pussy, you never know how good it is 'till you hit it

[Hook]
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
I like my weed purple, fluffy just like a pillow
You smoke a little I love to fill up the cigarillo
Outta' control mane a different mode mane
Outta' my body I feel like I'm on soul plane
Don't ask me how high baby I'm on cloud nine
And I'mma be smokin and burnin untill I damn die
Passin it with my people smokin it like its legal
Me and AR higher than two bald eagles
I got some blue weed straight from Africa
Too high to drive so I gotta play the passenger
That shit'' damage you, mark it on your calendar
Everyday is 420 baby I need the cannabis
I smoke a 8th a day, I smoke the pain away
I smoke on sunny days and I smoke on rainy days
I'm in love with it, I'm in the club wit it
Don't pollute the air just put a dub in it

[Hook]
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Verse 3: Juice]
Man I be smokin' on that Bobby Brown and I go pound for pound
Roll it up in a swisher cause' that's how I get down
And I'm blowin' garcia Vegas when I'm out of town
And I don't smoke that much because I'm out of town
And know that because I'm rollin with that 4-5
Them hollow tips make sure that a nigga don't die
In AZ they say that nigga Juice is on fire
In Miami they say that nigga juice is loc'd out
So I peel it back and get so high oh my
Mary tellin' a nigga don't drive no lie
Every nigga I know be smokin' that weed
I'm high all the time and my favorite color is green
When you smoke I smoke, when you choke I choke
But don't hit it too fast motherfucker I'm broke
Just puff and pass when you smokin' on kush
And my weed got America fucked like George Bush

[Hook]
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that
Man I get so high
Can you imagine how fast the weed go
Take two puffs then pass
Pull out another sack so we can roll that

[Outro]
*Coughing* Shit man, goddamn man
It's that motherfuckin' California kush
Shit, goddamn man I'm high as a motherfucker man, shit
