I got a house on my face, custom made glasses
Lays on the
, ashes to ashes, valee to vessel
Known as an Aston, the oz
, homie, only you my absence
Let the nigga we gang members almost
Not the boats but get your but like the
My wrecken sales could never reflect my respect
What god damn death Jim for reverend
Money bags back and forth how carry it on
Homies on my lawn, still I grieve on
As I'm now to my crucifix, tears in my eyes, smiling on the inside
Nobody cares what I feel like, no
Now it's six
Next just to feel right, let's go
Carry on and my glasses, toast to competition
Ashed to ashes
See the
In the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, tell me we f*cking models
Spin wheel nigga shit you can pop it into
Making lane for the niggers that have never seen the leather
Red diamonds in the
, red frames in the lenses
How you know yo all? Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes somewhere on the road
Like a snitch nigga body, let this motherf*cker flow
Champaign in my glass feeling like a boss
I'm in love with a phantom like f*ck with the
Louie
Full of honeys
At a purple, keep it g cause that's me
These rap niggers speak urkle, survival of the fittest
Swimming in the dog seat world in my living room come and feed the sharks
For my city
Would a fellow park, nigga rappers like New York
Ain't nowhere to park
That's why I got a chauffeur, I don't need a valee, head the game, watch it burn
Give it up to
,
No bone in my body, nigga I salute you
You disrespect my hood I f*ck around and shoot you
You got the well running round throwing up bees
Niggers saying su wu like they're f*cking chinese
Ass
When I'm blowing on embrace, topped down blow a smoke go to f*cking interstate
See the
In the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, tell me we f*cking models
Spin wheel nigga shit you can pop it into
Making lane for the niggers that have never seen the leather
Red diamonds in the
, red frames in the lenses
How you know yo all? Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes somewhere on the road
Like a snitch nigga body, let this motherf*cker flow
