[Dr. Dre]
Now his parents hustled
So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When boys in the hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now
