[Verse 1: Game]
All purple like the Ravens
Hit you with mixtapes till your fuckin' chest cave in
My flow a nightmare, West Craven
Get it, the West cravin'
My style, I know it's been a while
Naw, nigga it's been a day since I hit you with that purple tape
Niggas know my style, movin' them tracks out
And the R.E.D. Album gon' be worth the wait
Naw, nigga the Earth gon' shake
And Rihanna gon' be hoppin' out of birthday cakes
I'm a trending topic, tell these lil niggas stop it
Nigga I'm clockin', let your G Shock clock it
Just got a Mazi, took it to the shop, dropped it
Slide through the 'hood, 3 bars side pocket
With my side chick and the hair flip
Like the old Sidekick, the world bumpin' my shit

[Hook]
Oh, didn't think I would make it up here, right
Oh, didn't think I would make it up here, right

[Verse 2: Game]
Niggas like "Game, you did this yesterday?", that's right
Matter fact to be exact, I did it last night
And I can prove it to you
The Heat lost to the Knicks in Madison Square, nigga I'm like Google to you
Watch how I do it to you
I'm the king, started my own gang, shit I'm like Larry Hoover to you
Naw, matter fact Freddy Kreuger to you
This ain't a dream I'll really put the ruger to you
Scared how that new shit drop, set up shop
R.E.D. Album gon' drop, them niggas gon' call Koch
Niggas gon' call cops, Chuck Taylor in the building
Can't see the goons, they blend in like chameleons
Rolling Stone said I'm brilliant
Hottest mixtape since Wayne dropped No Ceilings
Now I ride around the 'hood with no ceilings
Everybody in the movies clappin' for the villain

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Famous Fresh]
Yeah, comin' from nothin', gettin' money, what you left to do
Plan to execute or end up a vegetable
We watch the same game but somehow I got the better view
Chuck helped a nigga, 'bout to blow like an inner tube
Big blunt smokin', flossin' in my interviews
Two bad bitches naked in my living room
Big black Benz's, both of 'em 62's
Bottles on ice, livin' life like s'posed to do
Nigga, stop hatin', start congratulatin'
We throwin' paper in the air like we graduated
They say money talk, well check a nigga's conversation
Talk so much, Game made a nigga a occupation
Yeah, your boy Famous Fresh got skills
While your baby momma blowin' on me like a hot meal
Just another nigga with a attitude
California smoke nigga, live from the avenue

[Hook]

[Outro: Game]
Shit is real, it's the hangover
It's the hangover, it's the hangover
It's the hangover, it's the hangover
It's the hangover
When they say the game over
Do the same thing over
