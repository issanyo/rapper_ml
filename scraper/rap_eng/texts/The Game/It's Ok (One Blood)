Dre I See Dead People...
Yo Dre, Thought I Was Dead, West Coast
I'm The Doctors Advocate
Nigga Dre Shot Ya
Brought Me Back From The Dead
Thats Why They Call Him The Doctor
The Mavs Goin Drop Em
If 50 Ain't Rockin Wit Him No More
Its Ok I Get It Poppin
The whole Club Rockin Like the 6-4 Impala
Drink 'Cris Throw It Up Call The Shit Hydraulic
Then Piss in the Cup Call The Shit Hipnotic
I Bleed Compton, Spit Crack, Then shit Chronic
And You New Niggas Ain't Shit But New Niggas
Bape the nape Shoe Niggas I'm Talkin To You Nigga
Bounce in The 6-4 Throw Up The West Side Man
Sell Another Five Million Albums Yes I Am
Fresh Like Damn this Nigga Did It Again
A Hundred Thousand On His Neck
La Above The brim
Inside The Lambo
Shotgun Wit Snoop
What Would The Muthaf*ckin West Coast Be Without
One Crip And (One Blood)
One Blood,One Blood,One Blood,(Blood)
I'm From The West Side Of The 6-4 Impala
When Niggas Say Where You From
We don't Never Say Holla
Bandana On The Right Side
Gun On The Left Side
Niggas In New York Know How To Throw Up The West Side
Word To Eazy I'm So Ill Believe Me
I Made Room For Jeezy
But The Rest Of You Niggas Better Be Glad You Breathing
All I Need Is One Reason
I'm The King And Dre Said It The West Coast Need Me
I Don't Know Why You Niggas Keep Tryin Me
Everybody Know I'm The heir To The Aftermath Dynasty
And I Ain't Got To Make Shit For The Club
What Dj Goin Turn Down The 38. Snub
You 38 And You Still Rappin Uhh
I'm 26 Nigga So Is The Dubs
On The 07 Hummer Hop Out
Nobody Guard You When The Cronic
Smoke Clear All You Goin See Is (One Blood)
One Blood,One Blood,One Blood,(Blood)
I Ain't Got Beef Wit 50
No Beef With Jay
Whats Beef When You Gettin Head in The 6 Tray
And The Double Game Chains
I Keep em On Display
Black T-Shirt So All You See Is The A
Turn On The TV And All You See Is The A
You Niggas Better Make Up A Dance To Try To Get Radio Play
Keep On Snappin Your Fingers
I Ain't Goin Away
I Don't regret what I spit
Cause I Know what I say
Niggas Talk About Me They Don't Know When To Stop
I Got The Louis Vouton Belt buckle Holdin The Glock
No Beam No silencer I Know When To Pop
I Wait Till Lil John Come On To Let Off A Shot
I Had The Number One Billboard Spot
Niggas Stepped On My Fingers And I Climbed Right Back To The Top
I'm B.I.G,I'm Cube,I'm Nas,I'm Pac
This Ain't Shit But A Warning Till My Album Drop (One Blood)
One Blood,One Blood,One Blood,(Blood)
One Blood,One Blood,One Blood,(Blood)
