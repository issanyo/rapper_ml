[Intro]
Game i got'cha
Feel how i look, damn good

[Chorus]
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare (we in the house)

[Verse 1]
Weezy baby, tell em we amazin'
Better yet the army, the U.S. Navy
Then tell Slim, i was raised on Cash Money
They can't kick me out of shit, i ain't Dame Dash dummy
I'm the gage pass a hundred in that red ferrari
Me and Weezy blood brothers, we got red ferrari's
Red tops in the hood, red tops on bacardi
Red tops on top models at the after party
Before S dot Carter was Brooklyn's stepfather
I was gettin' G money like Nino at the Carter
I was just a baby like the face on the third Carter
Even had a baby face like Tracy Evan's baby father
Nigga so you know what i mean
When i say i get the money like a money machine, yeah
I'm in L.A. Gasol-in'
But when im in New Orleans, you can call it Chris Paul-in' (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare (we in the house)

[Verse 2]
Okay, holla at'cha blood
It's big dog Weezy in that big dog breezin' with the wig off
It ain't easy to go this hard
But Weezy go this hard like pussy right in front me
I get pussy, i get money, i don't get none of y'all niggas
Like 2-3, im after everyone of y'all niggas
What am i sayin', im ahead of all y'all niggas
And mine gon shine like Armour All hit us, hah
I wear that chopper like a uniform
You bitch niggas never see me like a unicorn
Who the boy make the girls go crazy
I got that red magic, unbelievable, amazin'
Hey, it's a beautiful day
I'm feelin' like the father of a sunray
Like Jamie Foxx or box like Floyd May'
And if the weather right, i play the red box Porsche-ay, c'mon

[Chorus]
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Don't you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare (we in the house)

[Verse 3]
Like a home invasion
And this time im gon shine like the chrome on dayton's
You can wait on Detox or you can have more patience
Baby sip that patron while we get wasted
Weezy-Wee sip lean, me, i just taste it
We be soakin' up syrup like a waffle house apron
Infared beams goin' back to the basement
I'm a street king, ask dude from the matrix
Yeah, Cash Money in the basement
Me and Slim like the Hot Boys with a face lift
Translation, it's Freddy versus Jason
Who your favorite rapper, me and Weezy will erase them
And if they gettin' money then we will paper chase them
With beams that glow in the dark like Kanye's stage shit
Then we highjackin' Kanye's spaceship
And land it on the red carpet at the VMA's bitch (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
If you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)

[Verse 4]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You gotta be there to know it, where everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You gotta be there to know it, where everybody wanna see
To live and die in L.A., to live and die in L.A
To live and die in L.A., to live and die in L.A. (c'mon)

[Chorus]
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress
Red Porsches, red portraits
Red guns if you dare come near the fortress (we in the house)
If you dare come near the fortress
Don't you dare come near the fortress
