[Verse 1]
Here's a dome shot to this nigga named Otis
Niggas think they the coldest but nigga you just the oldest
Niggas be chasing their youth, but it's gone
Yo, 'Ye, this nigga didn't even want to put you on
He turned around, put on Sean
But forgot to tell him Beni Han-han, don't sell no fuckin' wontons
I don't wear Sean John, but I fuck with that CÃ®roc shit
2Pac back, well Hit 'Em Up with some Pac shit
"Who run the world?" Jayceon
Yeah, with Kelly Rowland, come and be my motivation
If you invented swag, then I invented gangsta
Got one in the chamber; the throne is now in danger
And I don't wear no Gucci Gucci Fendi Fendi Prada
I'm Charles Louboutin, you niggas ain't saying nada
Lil white bitch, better stay in your place
You call me a nigga, I'mma put the K in your face, this a stick up bitch

[Hook]
So put your hands up in the air!
I just wanna know is any gangstas up in here
I do it, I do it, boy

[Verse 2]
Call Khaled tell em "fuck it I'm on one.."
I created Tyler the Creator
Here go, courtside seats: you are now watching the greatest
Shades blocking the haters, stays rocking the latest
The show goes 'til I start aiming the lasers
And Lupe will souffle, half you muther fuckers
It's the Drew League, I don't wanna speak about The Rucker
Cause Jennifer Lopez just got a divorce and
Already got her up in the Porsche tryna teach you how to love
Marc Antony too short, look how that nigga look
Man, I'm "6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot.."
Crooks and castles, all my niggas crooks with castles
Red Nation graduation: yeah crooks with tassles
It's a party, it's a party it's a party
Sitting up in Marvin's Room, blowing that Marley

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got the money up in the rubberband
Run up on me, try to take it from me
I ain't Morris Chestnut, I ain't Ricky
But I give you 9 shots, you can call it 50
Dre got that super bass, I just call it Nicki
Working on that Detox, blowing on that sticky
Can I hit it in the morning? Bet it be a quickie
Gotta hustle hard Ace, Tunechi and Ricky
Waves Frank Ocean? You could see my odd future
You gonna need more than Novacane after I shoot you
Yesterday I went to Coachella, not to see Jigga
I went to see Wiz, but there's Amber: perfect
I took a seat on the red futon
Hit it with that Wiz shit on - whatever
So put that pussy on my face
And let me taste a little taste
I'mma eat it up like it's my last
I'mma do it different, she ain't getting no cash
You know why? I'm not a star
Somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car, that ain't a lie

[Hook]

Uncle Otis, holler at me!
