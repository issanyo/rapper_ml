Ol' English
(Ridin' by, gettin' high)
Smokin' on that chronic, drinkin' (Olde English)
(Rags tied, gang sign)
Letters on my hat in (Old English)
(Drive-by, homicide)
R.I.P. tats in (Old English)
(Westside 'til I die)
Niggas pourin' out that (Olde English)

[Verse 1:The Game]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I watched my Uncle Greg put D's on a '6-4
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Chopped crack and watched "Colors" so I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette
Til' one weekend my Uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my Pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older, I would understand that
It's blood in, blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13, that's when I had my first (Olde English)

[Verse 2:The Game]
I was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and make the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brothers Glock
And that's the day my life changed cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that "Chronic" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my a-di-das
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left finger prints on my (Olde English)

[Verse 3:The Game]
I got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip
This is life, stop watchin' that "Boyz N The Hood" shit
You see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans
I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in (Old English)
