Pop- pop off!

Say you know me on the outside
You never see the inside, okay... Okay
It's sick, it's such a long time
Walkin' down a thin line, okay... Okay!

(chorus)
I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see my life and where I've been
I staying here with all my friends
I won't go down! I won't go down!
I see the way it's gonna end
I'm never gonna give in...

Now you're asking about the inside
Talking about the lost time, okay... Okay
I keep thinking like I'm big time
Trying to mess with your mind, okay... Okay!

(chorus)

[The Game]
We're going front, back, side to side
Six tre Impala, thats how gangstas ride
Turn the music up let the hood rock
And throw your muthafuggin hands in the air like we at Woodstock
The streets is talkin, you know you heard the name
The kid that rocks white crowds like Kurt Cobain
Chuck Taylor and The Prom Kings, The Game that crossed over
Now I'm sitting on the throne like the Game that lost hova
Used to get money like Guns 'n Roses
Still getting rock money but guns and holsters
And when the nights over I'm wearing the crown
I'm the king of L.A. and I ain't never going down

(chorus Ã—2)

Yo! Chuck Taylor! Show 'm how we ride on the West Coast. Ha!

[The Game]
We goin front, back, side to side
Front, back, side to side
We goin' front, back, side to side
