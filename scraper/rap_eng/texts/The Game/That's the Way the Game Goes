[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
They just shootin' up BOLO
Got a lock on the block, put the game in a chokehold
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
Still trappin' in the same clothes
Undercovers in them plain clothes, that's the way the game goes
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money, money

[Verse 1: Game]
Yeeeaaaah, I'm trappin' like T.I
If I trap 'til I die, nigga, that's my B.I
Same clothes as yesterday, so a nigga see why
We call ourselves trap stars and ride around in G rides
Bakin' soda, cookin' it, make sure them hoes watchin' it
Glaze on the Audemar, so you know I'm glockin' it
Rockin' it, bag it up and then I'm to the block with it
Hit a few corners in the Chevy then I'm droppin' it
Yeah, I'm block dimin' it, my bird's real confident
Never flip 'em where you lay your head, now that's common sense
Hit my connect, they already know what I'm comin' wit
That Phantom on them 24's, 50 round drummin' it
Remember when I was slummin' it? Well, ain't much changed
Blame it on my momma, she introduced me to cocaine
Now my block propane, burnin' rubber on the tires
Now Game, Shawty Lo will set the club on fire

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
They just shootin' up BOLO
Got a lock on the block, put the game in a chokehold
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
Still trappin' in the same clothes
Undercovers in them plain clothes, that's the way the game goes
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money, money

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Trap all night 'til the sun up
'Til it's all gone then re-up
Ball, what's up? You know how we do
Fifty want five, oh he want two?
In the kitchen, you know the menu
No red meat, straight sea food
The fish scale you know it cook well
T4L, you know we raise hell
Yeeaahh, got the game in a chokehold
Bricks on lock, got blow in stock
I'm Big round my way, plus I work 2Pac
Daaammnn, I meant to say two blocks

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
They just shootin' up BOLO
Got a lock on the block, put the game in a chokehold
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
Still trappin' in the same clothes
Undercovers in them plain clothes, that's the way the game goes
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money, money

[Verse 3: Game]
I got purp by the pound, birds by the kilogram
How you meet the connect? Just walk around the middle man
What if it's a problem? Gotta kill the middle man
Get that Donald duct tape and throw his ass in the van
Now what's a trapper? Me and Shawty Lo
'Fore we was rappers, we was choppin' onions, Martha Stewart know
Louis V apron keep the powder off my clothes
And fiends don't need skis for the California snow
I made California blow but I ain't never did California blow, keep a snow bunny
Everybody know that I can get it fronted, no money
Everybody know if I had it like Scarface, I'd get everybody blow
I should rent a helicopter and fly over the town
Look up, it's a bird, no, it's a cocaine cloud
And I know a million connects that'll hold Game down
And when I make it rain, my money make the rain sound

[Chorus: Shawty Lo]
They just shootin' up BOLO
Got a lock on the block, put the game in a chokehold
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
Still trappin' in the same clothes
Undercovers in them plain clothes, that's the way the game goes
We gettin' money in the trap tonight
We gettin' money, money
