[Intro]
Ayo Ron, turn me up a little bit
Ayo Just Blaze, you back on ya shit
Yeah
About to turn me into a motherfuckin' superhero or somethin'
From now on, niggas gon' need some kryptonite/crip-tonite to stop me
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Standin' on the top of the Eiffel Tower
Starin' down at New York City
Like the ghost of Biggie
My mind state
Like the crime rate
I think I'm John Gotti
Hit niggas in the head, with that all red Ferrari
Like the black Liberace
Diamonds cover Versace
When The Game on, the whole world sit down and watch me
The Takeover
The new Jay Hova
Like I dove
In the pot
And got
Mixed with bakin' soda
The black cobra
The black Costra Nostalgia
2 snub nose .38's inside gucci holsters
Make me a Young Gun but im not from Philly
But its a whole lotta cheese at steak, the beef killed it
I'm about to blaze, bungee jump off a building with no rope
The Game ain't no joke
That Bruce Wayne shit will get yo ass laid out
I'm Clark Kent
Under dark tint
But you can call me

[Hook]
Superman
It's a bird, it's a plane
Naw nigga, it's the motherfuckin' Game

I'm Superman
I leap over tall buildings
If a nigga touch my millions

Yeah you gotta see Superman
You see this "S" on my vest?
And Lois Lane ridin' shotgun in that '09 Vet?

It's Superman
Faster than a speedin' bullet
When I pull it
Motherfucker you can blame it on
Superman

[Verse 2]
Hit the block with the white powder
Fiends jumpin' from the free throw line like Dwight Howard
With the capes on
I spit the type of crack that they waitin' on
I'll be right back
Told you it wouldn't take long
Fuck wit my cash
I'm gettin' in ya ass
Like Beyonc√® thong
Black out the Porsche drillin' on the stocks
Cover the California plates and park the shit around the block
Jump out the phone booth wit infrared's on the Glocks
On some Call of Duty shit, a real life Xbox
My flow is python
A snake with ice on
Marble floors through the mansion just to roll my dice on
Hennessy'd up Coca Cola chasin' at my superpowers
You fuckin' cowards
That Peter Parker shit'll get yo ass laid out
Pull Shaq's Escalade out
Motherfucker it's

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck Batman and Robin
Bring that Batmobile through Compton
Nigga, we'll rob em
Escalade armored trucks
Parelli's all armored up
And this .38 will knock the beak off of Daffy Duck
Wave cap
Cover my waves hollow tip cover my ass
Face covered by my army surplus ski mask
Welcome to Vietnam
Dump the chronic ash in the bomb
The phantom ash trays
The last days
Of Saddam
I was greasin' my palms
Like the D-boys do
Box it like Tarver, nigga i can see Roy, too
X-ray vision, I can see a decoy too
I'll bring the fuckin' Lions out like Detroit do
Yeah, die haters
I'm leapin' over sky scarpers
Like five Lakers
When it come to my paper
And I won't stop 'til i can buy Vegas
You fuckin' with The Man of Steel, a.k.a

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah motherfuckers
Me and Just Blaze in this motherfucker
Sky High on you niggas
Yeah I'm from Compton
Stop askin' me if I still live in the hood, nigga
I'm a motherfuckin' millionaire, I had to move, nigga
Know where I live now?!
In the motherfuckin' sky
And all you punk ass niggas that hatin' me
Sweepin' dirt on my mothafuckin' name
Know what I'ma do to you niggas?!
Nothin'
I'ma fly up, up and away on you punk ass niggas
Yeah
G4 status
Black Wall, Black Wall yeah
I ain't no muthafuckin' Soulja Boy, I'm Superman
Hahahahahaha
Just Blaze!
I ain't no muthafuckin' Soulja Boy, I'm Superman
Haha
Up, up and away!
