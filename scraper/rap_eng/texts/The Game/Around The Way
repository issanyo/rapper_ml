(Keyshia Cole)

I will always love you
I need you to know that
Im gonna hold you down
Till it kills me
Im here for you

I hate to say I told you
That niggas hate
No matter what they say
Im gonna hold you down
Till it kills me
Im here for you

(The Game)

(Verse 1)
You know what they
More money,more problems,more drama
Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even all Nike air forces come in two
I like her and I like you 2
Whats wrong
She ma bitch and you ma boo
She gotta CLS and you gotta a Bentley Coup
She take all my clothes to the cleaners
And you take them to school
I gave you a Berkley bag
I made a mistake
And Oprah dont fuck wit them no more anyway
I know you get sick and tired of me cheating
But you forgave me
After i fucked mya
Sorry for the bullshit I put you through
I ain't gonna no where I got a kid wit you
She always say jay got beyonce and wayne
I just turn the volume up and let Keyshia Cole sing

(Verse 2)
Dre told me "Its the power of the P.U.S.S.Y"
That have a nigga daydreaming in the S.K.Y
I can't replace you ur man and put you in the S5
But I can make sure when i hit
They can hear you in bedstuy
That's B

You kno how I do
How your girlfriends get to hate Wen I ride through
Like he fucked her at wats her name
Record release party
I rather fuck with rihanna and I dont even know shawty
My alibe is I had to lie
I kiss and dont tell and hit and oh well
I make the boat sail
And ditched the hotel
If a man got a problem
Get hit with doch shells
Then after the hotel
Its the after party
With IV's in his wrist
While I'll leave with his Bitch
Blow the roof
Let her feel the breeze in the 6
They said R&b dead
But keyshia that bitch

(Chrous)

(Verse 3)
Its money that makes 7 days change
From puerto rico to watch a lakers game
I give my heart and my house and chain
Just to she your face when the roses came
You wanted me to meet your family Im on the next plane to eat dinner With your mom and P.F change
She said she will die for you and I told her I'll do the same
And i feel it in her eyes
She can see my pain
I told you I had a son
You wanted to kno his name
Harlem
But my fans call him baby game
Before his birth I was against all odds in the streets
Me and, micheal,face dodging police
My baby momma play games with me
So me and her
Like ciara and bow wow
We like Nas and Kelis
In London i told you I would give you the world
I was your LL
And you were my around the way girl
