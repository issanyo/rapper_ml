[Hook - Chris Brown]
All these girls around the World, they love me
I’m supposed to be the only one
It ain't my fault if all these ladies love me
Thought I was supposed to the only one
Believe that I’m a gangsta girl
All I ever wanted was a real girl
You know that I’m a gangsta girl

[Verse 1 - The Game]
I’m supposed to be your number one
Thought we was getting married when the summer come
Two piece Armani with the cummerbund
And when she look in my eyes she see a money sign
She see Louis Vuitton, she see them Prada heels
I took her outta that coach, how that Escada feel?
I mean its gotta feel good to a bitch about the hood
Driving a Rose Phantom with an angel on the hood
I mean we living that good
Chowing on Mr Chow’s after this it’s Pillippe
Nigga you know my style
Little Cristal, Little Rose
A whole bunch of Al’s bad bitches in the place
Nigga feel like an owl, nigga I’m so fly
Pull that Bugatti out, them haters gon die
Baby you know them doors are suicide
And it ain't about nothing but you and I

[Verse 2 - The Game]
She used to stash my loot, all in the sofa
Then I used to knock her boots all in the sofa
She had 3 stocks, one chrome on that Toyota
Then she flipped channels on a nigga:
Oprah, all up in the club getting hawked by the vultures
The female Spreewell, was too hard to coach her
So I had to do the best thing for both us
Take myself shopping, get my Ralph Lauren coats up
It ain't tricking if you got it right, oo sir
Can’t get a shot of Patron unless she gonna fuck
Can’t leave these hoes alone nigga it’s so tough
Especially if they finance the nose, I pick them both up
Then we hit South beach, pull my Gucci loc’s up
Hit my nigga Wayne like "let me borrow some?"
Looking like a casting call and we show up
We getting Young Money but we grown up
So what!

[Verse 3 - The Game]
Baby girl always running her mouth
So I told her "you know I run this town"
It's like she live in Australia:
Her world is upside down
But it's an upside collective
I love when she face down
She my sex slave, I'm the king
I wear the crown. Now how that sound?
To the lames that run around with dames
Got gunned down. Cum stains on nightgowns
Chapstick on champagne glasses
Louis Vuitton, Gucci belt, ain't a damn thing flashy
But me in L.V
Now niggas see I don't do menage no more
I'm on my fourth LP
Now we in the 64 deep
Automatics, key in my pocket, that's low-key
In the spur of the moment I'm Ginóbili
I ball with Kobe while you sit in Oakleys
