[Verse 1]
Yeah yo I walk through the valley of death
Vest on teflon now I'm approached In my hurricane sweats
Black chrome on my shoulder, big wheel till It's over
He never got to see me put black chrome on the rover
Readin your obituary, wishin we never met
So I wouldn't have to shed tears or wake up In cold sweats
Lookin at this bottle of hennessy wishin you never left
Wishin I chased your Monte Carlo down and gave you my vest
Or better yet, I wish they never let you out
And I never got that phone call tellin me that you out
Wish you never signed the release form
I wouldn't have to clear this sample
Or use this track to say rest In peace for him
You wanted to know If Dre and Em felt you?
They did and before I could tell you somebody killed you
I feel pain for everybody whoever knew the real you
Call Nas let him know I got a Ill Will too

[Hook x2]
My nigga, If you look In the mirror
Would you see things clearer?
My nigga who I live, who I live for
My nigga
And you know where you headed
Do you know who you are
And why you do the things you do?
My nigga

[Verse 2]

Niggas politicin' wanna know why I'm rhymin different
My best friend got murdered nigga my mind is different
If you ain't never spend no time In prison
You can't understand these bars or the lines I'm spittin
Niggas rilin' me up, lets go find the victim
I can't do It homie thats the reason Shyne in prison
And through devine Intervention
10 plus years doing crime In the trenches
Multiplied by the time that we spent In the kitchen
I'ts a life worth of hard livin
Cuban cigar tippin, 12th grade ditchin
Purple served by the jar sippin
If you lost a homie, you know freindship is God given
I done seen the church so much, you'd think I was born Christian
I done seen more dead bodies than a mortitian
Seen niggas In and out of county blues like they was born crippin
So I'mma keep on livin
Cuz when I'm gone niggas ain't gon do shit but fuck my bitch and pour liqour

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
What If you was me? and you had to sit through an entire funeral
While the pastor readin your homeboyz eulogy
I'm already dead, what the fuck you gon do to me?
Keep talkin shit I'll empty my clip in that G-Unit tee
Gimme a minute to say my grace with God
I see your face in the mirror
I came a long way to talk and tell you
Your moms is missin you
Your pops is missin you
Just saw your baby pictures In your grandmothers living room
Fase is missin you
Homie Wink is missin you
Thank God you left us memories and songs to listen to
Vale is missin you
The hood is missin you
Let my son graduate high school, and I'mma come visit you
The world is missin you
Eminem was feelin you
Dre said he felt your vibe the little time he spent with you
Pour the henny out cause he ain't here in the physical
They say real men don't cry but nigga I'm missin you
