[Verse 1: Game]
Bitch don't kill my vibe, nigga don't blow my high
Wake up in a Bugatti but I'm in a Maserati when I'm on the 405
I'm king of the motherfuckin' Westside
Two dubs up when the TEKs fly (Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla! Bla!)
Turn a 600 to an S5
Compton made me direct this ending
Like my little nigga Kendrick, and props to Jay-Z
Got a Rocky pendant and a drop Mercedes
I'll be gone 'til November but I'm not from Haiti
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-N, N-I, double G-A
Like a young D-Wade, brought my city a championship by myself
And niggas think I'm doin' this shit for my health
I am, don't make me go HAM, 4-5
Go blam, I was just protecting my wealth
Matte black Bentley, all-black pennies
Black Tom Ford shades, I'm 'bout to go stealth
All black everything
Trap Wesley Snipes inside Tiffany's wedding ring
Nigga, never get out
I'm constipated, just tryna get my shit out
False alarm, I can't do number two
Pee on you peons for eons and eons
Used to intercept niggas, rock like Deion
Sellin' white packs out my grandmama's Neon
Ask my nigga Breon
I played Pac's brother in this classic movie
No relationship to Leon
When I spit for Dre I had a nigga forehead like a nigga was a klingon
No album out, I'm on 106 like a nigga put Free on
Any beat that I breathe on or be on, I be gone
I brawl like I'm out in Maryland, Georgetown, Michigan
Florida, watch a nigga get his UNC on
Baby Jordans for my baby daughter
No Harold Miner, can I get my USC on?
Eight cars in my driveway, sideways
Horsepower make the Lamborghini fly away
I am the shit when I step out the Six
And I step at your bitch in my brand new kicks
Eh-eh you bitch, don't act brand new
Cause you suck on my dick when you walk in my crib
Airplane mode, won't be no duck lips next to Van Gogh
Dance with the devil, I learned to tango
S on the metal, I wrapped the Range Rove
Ride to my limits inside the Infinite
God is my witness, I've got the roof in it
Designed to go win it
Mismatched rims on the motherfuckin' Phantom
Nigga, nigga on God, I'mma spend it
Compton, Westside, and I'm riding with Kendrick

[Outro: Kendrick]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
