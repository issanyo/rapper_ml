[Verse 1: Game]
I'm gangsta
Flip pies and bricks
On the block with the work since 96'
Now I'm on Aftermath we supply them hits
Now everybody love Dre
And they riding dick
Cause Eminem getting money
Fifty getting money
Streets is talking watch the Game after this summer
I ain't talking 'bout the NFL
I'm talking 'bout me and Big Fase 100 in them twin SL's
Cause I'm a gangbanger nigga
So try your luck
And have desert eagle slugs whizzin by your truck
Kanye don't lie
I'm high as fuck
That's the purple haze
Family Matters but I been smoking since the Eurkel days
I can't rember if I was five or ten
When my Uncle Greg got locked
Did a five to ten
Got out and got stabbed to death
I though I never understand how a nigga could just kill a man
Now you see me walking out the cemetery like thriller man
And I ain't MJ
But when the game on the line
Gotta take them shots like MJ
And that ain't no bullshit when the Mac-10 spray
Give 'em fifty in the garden
Kill you by myself and I don't need no Pippen when I'm ballin'
Got niggas in the Nickerson Gardens
That will fill you up with holes like G-Unit and Fifty in the Garden

[Hook: Game]]
Here is something they can't understand
They wanna know where Dre found him man
Somewhere running 'round Cali with the pound in hand
And I can't for my shit to hit the fan
Here is something they don't understand
Them 16's coming from Compton man
Now he got a deal nobody can stop him man
And it's gonna take more than five shots to drop him damn

[[Verse 2: Game]]
I'm in the field breaking down birds like the steelers man
Pray to God I don't ever have to kill again
Don't leave the house with out the steel in hand
Cause everybody know I'm selling the rock like Killa Cam
Cross me I'll kill ya fam'
Hogtie ya bitch
By them fake Manolo's
Fuck her brains out if you run to the jakes or popo's
Black Wallstreet nigga
I came for dolo
Remember when my brother used to bang K-Solo
I was twelve years old with cocaine in polos
And niggas knew who I was
Furthered mixtapes with whoo kid
All of a sudden dude got buzz
Is he from Compton?
Is he from Queens?
Is he from Yonkers?
Is he on Aftermath?
Can he write me a 16?
Is that Eazy E's son?
Is he a blood or a crip
My air force ones the same color as bricks
Last week I bought my mother a gift
That 2004 McClaren the same color as piss
Got a nine the same color as this
I'm a ghetto boy
I just rap a lot like J. Prince

[Hook]

[Talking]
Now that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
This goes out to all my gangsta niggas across the muthafuckin' globe
Holla at ya boy Chuck Taylor
I got to let em know
That's wassup
And you know I got to holla at my nigga K-Dog
See him in the field with them K's dog
Yeah
It's Aftermath muthafucker
Cut a check or suck a dick
