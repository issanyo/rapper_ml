[The Game]
West Coast, it's all about survival nigga
West Coast, California's own
Black Wall Street, D.P.G.C
You niggas know what it is
Compton and Long Beach back together again..

[Daz Dillinger]
You know it's, murda-murda, bring the drama for ya mama
Got them .223's in the back of the Impala
Niggas got a problem, nigga this how we could fix it
Ten or twenty of my homies goin' all on a mission
Lookin' for them niggas to let 'em know that it's on
Send a couple niggas to the funeral home
Them niggas that you love is back (Like that?)
(Chrome gat motherfucker, where it's at?)
I'm only fuckin' with them real niggas who stay in the street
I'm only fuckin' with them real niggas who playin' for keep
With a street sweeper sweepin' your whole block with a tool
I'm old school with it, I don't play by the rules
Bundles of cash, two thousand grams, turnin' soft into hard
Don't you know we the shit up on the boulevard?
Don't you know that niggas died just for playin' hard?
0-8' chrome shoes, bulletproof car

[Chorus]
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)

[The Game]
It's too much gangsta shit goin' on in the fuckin' world
For niggas to be actin' like girls
I'm the Gangbang General, never rhyme a subliminal
12-gauge shotty to your body, a fuckin' criminal
A animal, West Coast beat cannibal
Who got the antidote? I'm sick on this gangsta shit
Not Blood or a Crip, I'm a Anybody Killa
For reala, half Blood half motherfuckin' gorilla
Suicidal, my flow is a automatic rifle
My rag is a flag, I should hang it from the fuckin' Eiffel
Tower, MC's I devour, a lyrical time bomb
I explode to the next episode
Cutlass ridin', butler drivin'
Head low cause it's all about motherfuckin' survivin'
In the city I claim, Westside we bang
The Game, and the D.P.G.C. gang

[Chorus]
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)

[Kurupt]
Dogg Pound Gangstas, let it rain motherfucker
It ain't really nothin' to explain motherfucker
Just the other day I was posted talkin' some numbers
Tryin' to get it right, underneath my Chinchilla it was winter
And plus I had to conceal the sinja
Gotta get it right, full scale pushin'
Everything I'm livin' for, I'm more on these bustas
I'm sick of shit, and every nigga pushin' with me sick of shit
Where the paper bitch?
Next word I hear from ya I'll I'm domin' ya all
Sometimes I feel like hittin' hoes and domin' ya all
Ride out with me, come out that drought with me
Come scout with me, come find out what it's about with me
Motherfucker, "Ya'll Must Have Forgot" like Roy Jones
All about the home invasion, gangstas on Vogue's
You'll never be able to put the gangstas on hold
Motherfucker, keep it G and get the P to roll
In and out this niggas shit, fast in a flash
Keep talkin' shit nigga see how fast on the flash
We'll be in that ass, through the pockets, get the cash, me and Daz

[Chorus]
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And we don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck (Anybody Killa)
And don't give a fuck where you from
(Anybody Killa)
