As I walk through the valley of death...I shall fear no evil
Now do you really think I'ma let ya'll murk me(g-g-g-g-g)
Tell me why these niggas is tryin' to hurt me (g-g-g-g-g)
Lord please forgive, I'll have no mercy (g-g-g-g-g-g-unit)
When I catch them, they ass is done, lord forgive me
Do you really think I'ma let ya'll murk me(g-g-g-g-g)
Tell me why these niggas is tryin' to hurt me (g-g-g-g-g-g-unit)
Lord please forgive, I'll have no mercy
When I catch them, (g-unit)they ass is done
Lord forgive me for my sins, cause her I come (50 sent me that's who)
Y'all really think y'all gonna murk me, (haha) cause here I come
Y'all need a fucking army to murk me (we'll stand over you niggas)
And I ain't stopping nigga- ain't no mercy

[Cuban Link]
Yo, ain't no mercy, in the hood
Cats is thirsty, in the hood
For the bread, niggas spread lead like herpes, in the hood
Mama birthed me, in the hood
Papa turned me to a hood
Did my share of dirt, put in the work, I'm worthy of the hood
Nothin's blurty, in the hood
Do you dirty in the hood
Got the crooked cops, a lots of little birdies, in the hood
You'll get buried, in the hood
Bright and early, in the hood
Thugs will put a 30-30 slug firmly, in ya hood, what's good?
We could hood it down, and make it happen
Before I made it rappin', I was more dedicated to aggravated scrappin'
The chin tappin', that crackin' your jaw pimp slappin'
I been baggin' the bad broads, I been mackin'
I been packin' the mack 10s, I been clappin'
Before the twins crashed in Manhattan, I bin laden
So quit the actin' before I capture ya life
You'll catch a lashin', through your ass like the Passion of Christ, nigga

[Chorus]
Lama on ya, so I'm down to ride (to ride)
I ain't the type to let the drama slide (drama slide)
Bring your armor when you come outside (come outside)
Cause I won't show no mercy (I want show no mercy)
Y'all gonna make me catch a homicide (homicide)
Pop the lama, leave you dramatized (dramatized)
Y'all don't wanna see ya mama cry (mama cry), (Cuban Link)
Cause I won't show no mercy (no mercy)

[The Game]
Nigga I'm made
Call the Brooklyn zoo, let 'em know the gorillas out his cage
One hand on the holy Koran, one hand on the gage
Call fifty, tell 'em send the brigade
Whenever my pin out, homie I'm a grenade
I'm from Compton, where niggas don't die of old age
When you see son out, better put on shades
Cause I shine like Easy and Pun in they last days
See the problem is- niggas gettin' old
I'm startin' a new chapter, and we ain't on the same page
I stole the crown, I'm a damn good crook
You ain't gotta go to Ryker's to get ya manhood took
They don't like me- fuck 'em
You don't want me to be the reason niggas climbin' 'em fences at the rutger
Don't get it twisted- I love NY
No mercy- that's right, he got blood in his eye, bitch

[Chorus]
Lama on ya, so I'm down to ride (to ride)
I ain't the type to let the drama slide (drama slide)
Bring your armor when you come outside (come outside)
Cause I won't show no mercy (I want show no mercy)
Y'all gonna make me catch a homicide (homicide)
Pop the lama, leave you dramatized (dramatized)
Y'all don't wanna see ya mama cry (mama cry), (Cuban Link)
Cause I won't show no mercy (no mercy)
