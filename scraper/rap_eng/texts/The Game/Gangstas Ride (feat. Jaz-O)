[Intro: The Game]
The motherfucking Originator (haha)
Gangstas Ride on x2

[Verse 1: Jaz-O]
Worldwide Originator and I'm packin' a 4
Motherfucker going home no more
Not a thug but I put you in the rug with a couple of slugs
Try the canvas, hoes blow where the white chalk closed door
Friends turn enemies stolen identity, can't get rid of me
I watched the crip game bubble up, and keep the price double up
You got a problem with a mossy nigga like I would'a knock her up
But you know about 1976 a young nigga gettin' money
Playin' tripple up I'm the prototype, first one, king of the tricklet when I first did it Twista wasn't even in the business
Knew B.I.G. when he wasn't even in the business
Put a new nigga Jay-Z in the business
Got a motherfucker three-way 'till he shitless, my style south style Jay's not the style

[Verse 2: The Game]
Now when the niggas gone tough slick when the guns come out
Niggas see me in O.G. rollin' on goldies
Runnin' the house Paull Wall did ya grill open up let me see catch wildin'em out
Niggas snitch
Six in ya fit it forget it talk shit you better live on my nigga
I'm on the block 'till I get here, ball like the business
I'm raining dollar swap pop big shit
10 months while platinum black subtract, take half of that
Bring it back now, like an ounce of crack
Then put it in a plastic back and call it Aftermath
I walk like a gangsta, talk like a gangsta
Impala with the Cherry-red paint

[Hook: The Game]
And them gangstas ride on
(East side, west side c'mon)
And the gangstas ride on
(North side, south side c'mon)
And the gangstas ride on

[Verse 3: Jaz-O]
Like tellin' nigga couldn't spill half a gallon
Who the fuck said a man couldn't be anillin'
Back pockets to the concrete for the wrong heat
Three bodies at, where the body bags that's a wrap don't want them Aftermath don't wanna make'em mawee
Cause I'm so street
Been a Mac Hawaiian since Sophie
Got ya ice grills with 40 fills, still
Act like you know me homie
God will make your... holy
Watch me closely
Triple [? ]
That's level baby I'm a [? ] weather baby

[Verse 4: The Game]
Niggas don't want it with the bee gees
Niggas don't wanna see me cause I'm an a-hole
Especially when I ride with Jaz-o in a continental T with the ass low
What you got your foot on the gas for
We get dat doe
Climb through the window
And run through the back door
Black out with the mack out
Blast four blast four more
Originator give em what they ask for

[Verse 5: Jaz-O]
Enemies I murder them
I hurry like I bury them
Walk through your hood with my two blocks on
I'm in my new shoes with my new socks on
Shine like a diamond get your blue blocks on
Jaz-O stupid motherf*cker not Shawn
Never been blast on a 2pac song
The originator double time creator
Too fast

[Hook: The Game]
And them gangstas ride on
(East side, west side c'mon)
And the gangstas ride on
(North side, south side c'mon)
And the gangstas ride on
