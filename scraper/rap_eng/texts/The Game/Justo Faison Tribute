(Justo)
Word up, I be the one they call Justo if ya didn't know
Tryin' to check my man DJ Skee
With his new mix tape
Pick it up ya square
Ya heard what I'm sayin?

(Game)
It's another sad day in hip-hop
We lost another one of my brothers
Justo Faison
We love you
And we'll always miss you
Mix tape king
Forever...

We'll always love you Justo x4

(Verse 1)
I picked up my pen four years from the day
Never thought I'd be rappin, or even signed to Dre
I never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on a clue mix tape
On a Birdman beat, then my name started buzzin
Aftermaths young gun and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's lil brother
He took me to K Slay and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King I shoulda known, cause all of a sudden
Emcees callin' my name and I'm beefin' wit Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colours
Then caught him at Def Jam, found out it wasn't nothin
Look back at my career starin' out at the city
Thinkin' about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to bad boy, would 50 be on the math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed

(Hook)
We'll always love you Justo x4

(Verse 2)
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And Sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over a 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they started showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out, I was with Dre
And at Bodega's I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houstons and that's the first time I met Nas
Had billboard wit me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry

(Hook)
We'll always love you Justo x4

(Verse 3)
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels gettin' scared
Cause the kid from Compton sellin like Sunny and Cher
Mix tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, mix tape artist of the year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new king of the west coast
A couple of months passed and we ain't speak
My sidekick went off (Justo Rest In Peace)
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if ya know like I know
Live ya life to the fullest one day we all gotta go

(Game)
Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fiddy cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend
Justo Faison
Mix tape king
Rest In Peace
