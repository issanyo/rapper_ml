[Hook: Game]
I grew up off of Wilmington and Rosecrans
Where nigga's drink 4-0 cans and throw it up with both hands
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
I'm from where them niggas in the trenches
Sit back, get they hair braided and analyze Kendrick
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
I kick it where niggas do drive-bys all day
And bought a pair of Beats just because they fuck with Dre
We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga

[Verse 1: J3]
I grew up off of Rosecrans and Central
Tam's Burger on the corner, slip up and get your issue
Drum fully loaded, probably catch 'em walking
Die for your name, get a blue or a cherry coffin
Pray for the homie moms, why she had to lose her son
We gon' make 'em pay the price for what they done
Organized crime, go on a mission weekly
187, man-down completely
Grew up off food stamps and swam through blood baths
Sheriffs hop out, point guns, searching your nutsacks
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
That's what Crips call it, but 'round here this Bompton
I ain't politicking, I ain't sneaking dissing
I'm really for my section, creeping up Wilmington
With my locs concealing weapons
Fucked with K. Dot back when he had the waves
And been supporting Game since the Aftermath chain
Support Compton

[We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga

[Verse 2: Payso B]
It started in Martin Luther King
Poccet Hood Crip, before I knew anything
Married to the block, pinky ring for my wedding ring
Yeah we right here on Nord Street, the hood core street
I be in the hood, you ain't gotta force me
And I just thank God my momma didn't abort me
Cause she was only fourteen, but that's a different story
Whole family's running frutas and they support me
The Pirus support me, the Crips support me
Your bitch support me, hit a lick just to support those that was for me
My nigga Frogg was for me, V-Rocc was for me
Niggas phony but I know my niggas watching for me
Cause I done had some close cases
Wrong time, right places, my life, I ain't finna let 'em take it
My mind, I ain't finna let 'em take it
From El Segundo to Rosecrans, they know who run the program

[Verse 3: Game]
They be like "Dre ain't from Compton
Cube ain't from Compton", you niggas dumb
I be the type nigga to ask them niggas asking where they from
Yeah I be trippin', Deebo'n niggas
Cruising through the hood like fuck you, CeeLo them niggas
'64 in my garage, only drop the top on Saturday
Reminiscing to '96 when I was running through a rat a day
Compton High with the A.I. braids
Over the Summer came back with Junior Seau waves
Compton ain't shit, get a nigga fucked up and jumped
Race riots with the ese's but that ain't what you want
Red and blue bandanas knotted at the front
Welcome to the home of the pistol grip pump
Compton
