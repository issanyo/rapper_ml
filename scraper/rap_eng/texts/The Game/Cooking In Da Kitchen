And I'm swinging, swinging like I'm married to the bitches

Every single day I'm in da kitchen
Paps used to drop me off in a Nissan
And I used to be embarrassed by his car but I was driven
Now a nigga got a Benz be my underprivileged
Too big, all I had was time and ambition
And getting out the hood was the mission
It was either the pan or the pivot, now I'm shooting free-throws at the crib with my nigga's
Yeah we did it, I'm always fly down when I'm missing
They always hold me down how we living
And I don't understand what you arguing bout'
I mean I put us on the map, how could you not be proud huh?

[Verse 3: The Game]
Cooking in da kitchen
Ever since a nigga momma whipped him in the kitchen
Broke nigga, got sick of that shit
Turned rich, now look at the flick of that wrist boy
Turned an Impala to a Lambo
Call me ??? watch this bitch scramble
With a bird riding shotgun
Gave that bitch molly and a 12 gauge, bet that hoe pop one
Ooh I got the ratchets on me
Fuck the couch I'm on the floor with these ratchets homie
Cass, passin' that duffle
See nigga's crossing over there? Yeah they in trouble
We bout' to stunt
I got the Aventador, out in the front
You know I keep it Compton
Got a chopper and a five hundred thousand dollar car
Nigga you know who the fuck we are, it's the circle
