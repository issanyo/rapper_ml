[Hook: Chris Brown]
All this spot light is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home
I miss the days when life was simple
But if I never try to follow that rainbow
In search for the pot of gold
Oh, oh, oh
In search for the pot of gold

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Yuh
From the beginning we was winning said you'd never change
Real recognise me you lookin hella strange
Gotta ego at the moment you lit up in flames
Mother nature made it rain and I forgot to tell her thanks
Left all the suits back in manhatten but I don't regret it
I know I got that dope just tryin not to oversell it
This is a message from the future ho I know your jealous
The maker of my car the only one I know could spell it
Uh, hold that, food for thought and I'm so fat
They listen to the track and not the words like a show dat
A cold world sorry if you didn't snow dat
Haters can get to steppin I should put that on the floor mat

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
There's a mother out there right now
About to have the next lebron
Searching for a pot of gold like a leprahcaun
They say death comes in three, two next in line
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on the quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and su-woo when it's reppin time
You don't understand, I'm misunderstood
Give interscope two more albums then I'm done for good
Sold ten million records ain't leave the hood
It's a cold world, everybody in the hood
And everybody doing time, stay head strong
You still got a chance to live even though you dead wrong

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
It's crazy everyone that told me that I wouldn't make it
Estimations that didn't end how they anticapated
Such a bother I'm in the barber shop and gettin faded
I'm just listenin while you tell me how we is related
If I had a nickel (what), for every person that was jaded
I would leave it all for my son and tell my kid to save it
I grew up didn't have a nickel so the kid was hated
But I bet that I had a pistol that was nickel plated
Couldn't point you to a vagina I know that isn't tainted
Getcha g's and g spot is something different ain't it
I'm in love with the life I live I wouldn't switch or trade it
Your the reason the area around my crib is gated
Uh

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Game]
Sometimes I try to do good
But I just can't be!
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me
You all should thank me
But my haters really trying to send me home early
But you can't lora saint me
I ain't a saint b I ain't Gaga
I ain't an angel neither but I try hard ya'll
I'm light enough for my soldiers at war
I sit back and watch the ashes on my Sedan fall
Wayne just come home and Tip back on yard dawg
Guess soohops ain't the only ones playin hardball

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Oh, see the thing about all of us
We never know just what we find
