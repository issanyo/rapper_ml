[Intro: Talking]
Man, you know the same shit, man
The money, the cars, the bitches could fuck up a great friendship
Ya know!
To all my partners and the partners I lost

[Killer Mike:]
You used to be my nigga though, my nigga though
Who'd a thought you'd ever envy me and talk down on me to Jigga ho
Say we was tight like Wayne pants
And it was money over bitches even when we made it rain dance
Lucci over poochi, no romance
And I have never loved a ho so no ho-mance
Just my bro man
We got to the cash money but like Nino and G-money the money make shit go funny
The bitches made it wicked
The dopeless made it hopeless
The coppers and the robbers with choppers make me they focus
My nigga's snitching and I'm like Lord have mercy
My homie sold me out
My partner just hurt me
And all for a bitch I hope the nigga catch herpes
Nah, I'm fronting but at least the claps is hunting
Cause any other nigga I would have been clapping something
Instead of in the studio smoking and rapping something

[Hook: Killer Mike]
(And when it's cold outside you can count on your grown man)
You my nigga though
You still my nigga though
I don't fuck with you, uh uh, you still my nigga though
(And when it's time to ride, yeah. You can depend on me)
I'm still your nigga though
I'm still your nigga though
I don't fuck with you but, yo I'm still your nigga though

[Ludacris:]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Some pimps in our own fucking mind
On point at game time you would play your position
Then you came around and double crossed me like a ribbon
Oh no, abort mission
Some money's missing
Went broke, I guess you got to get paid like tuition
If not the President you got to be a politician
But others like myself are trying to carry on tradition
Put women in submission
We used to need permission
Ta-daaa, now we running through tricks like a magician
We smoking all the mirrors I knew something was wrong
So I made up a new trick it's called poof I'm gone
Now I see you on occasion and we holler at times
Cause things ain't all peachy like the Georgia lottery sign
And if you told me cocaine numbers I would think you was lying
But you got to get yours and fool I got to get mine
Luda!

[Hook: Ludacris]
(And when it's cold outside you can count on your grown man)
You my nigga though
You still my nigga though
I don't fuck with you, uh uh, but you my nigga though
(And when it's time to ride, yeah. You can depend on me)
I'm still your nigga though
I'm still your nigga though
I don't fuck with you, uh uh, but you my nigga though

[Game:]
Hey, I had this other nigga who was my brother
Jigga fan undercover
The blueprints of my life with different mothers
We was the closest out of my sisters and brothers
Two G's closer than the Gucci belt but life's a motha-fucker when you dealing with paper man
One of our ego's got bigger than skyscrapers man
After I put the documentary on them Daytons man
Around the Doctor everyday so I had patience man, he didn't
Around the dope spot he was pacing man, for digits
Am I my brother's keepers for real or not decisions
He was in love with strippers sort of like a bee for honey
And that was our separation like BG and Cash Money
(Damn) Why does it got to be like that?
I was stacking paper on tour I was gon' be right back
(God damn) Why you couldn't let your ego die?
If you see me rocking a hoody nigga you know why

[Hook: The Game]
(When it's cold outside you can count on your grown man)
You still my nigga though
You my nigga though
I don't fuck with you, uh uh, but you my nigga though
(And when it's time to ride, yeah. You can depend on me)
You still my nigga though
Always be my nigga though
I don't fuck with you, uh uh, but you my bigger bro

[Singing:]
When it's cold outside
You can count on your grown man
