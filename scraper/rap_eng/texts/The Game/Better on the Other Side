[Intro: Diddy]
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk
I believed I could do anything
You made the world dance
You made the music come to life

[Hook: Chris Brown]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go

[Verse 1: The Game]
Who’s Michael Jackson? You're Michael Jackson
I’m Michael Jackson, we all Michael Jackson
I guess what I’m askin' is, everybody bow their head for a legend, don’t breathe for a second
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about
So you can hear my message, my confession, somebody tell Usher
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him
Like he touched me, like he touched you
So carry on his legacy, somethin' I must do
And I trust you lightin' candles, concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to Jackson 5 in the livin' room
First thing I did when I heard, was call Puff
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us
Who was us? Me and fifty, that beef is dead, him and Mike Jackson gonna take us to the ledge

[Hook: Chris Brown]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go

[Verse 2: The Game]
As I’m pourin' out this liquor candles start to flicker
When list my air ones, MJ was my nigga
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star
And since I’m a Hollywood star I'ma tell you my story
Never had a family that close, never see Berry Gordy walkin' through Interscope
But just like me, they always had Mike in a scope
No matter what you say
I’ma love him and he’s still dope
Let me take you back to '85 when I was in a zone, dancin' for my mama, 'Thriller' jacket with all the zippers on
Now i’m doin' 90 bout to crash in this Aston
Listenin' to Outkast, I’m sorry Ms. Jackson
Anythin' I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we won't Corretta you
I’m writin' this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to let us through

[Hook: Chris Brown]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go, I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start, never gon' let you go

[Outro: Boys II Men]
This the kind of song that make the angels cry
Look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let die
This the kind of song that make the angels cry
Look up in the sky and ask God, why o why why
Do we live and let, live and let die
