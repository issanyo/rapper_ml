[Intro]
..like we always do about this time

[Verse 1: Eazy E]
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Eazy muthafuckin E wit a chrome to ya dome
Cruisin' in my 6-4 ragtop
I got alotta juice alotta fuckin block
Now when I hit dat switch im bouncin'
More bounce to the ounce and im clownin'
Keep tha gat in my lap
Cuz im fully strapped
For the carjackas, but no haps
Cuz I pack a TEC-9 plus an AK-47
Send a one way ticket to hell or maybe heaven
Peep nigga I dont sleep
Bury muthafuckaz in tha concrete
You try to creep kinda slow in tha astro
But I peep you niggas out my left window
So I blast and I blast 'til I blast no mo
Yo they call a muthafucka John Doe

[Hook: Eazy E]
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Old nigga E still cruisin'
Cruisin' down city of Compton

[Verse 2: Game]
1, 2, 3 and to tha 4
Pumps in tha trunk of that cherry red 6-4
I'm ridin' with tha ghost of Eazy hoppin' the leany
He watching fo demons
Nigga if you try me then I'm cocking tha nina
Begging Lucifer to gimme a reason
To have a hundred thou cash brought down to tha precinct
I'mma make bail money, this rap shit is a monopoly
And I got property, that's get out of jail money
Nigga I came from poverty
Shoot-outs, gang-banging, and robberies
Car-jacking, snatching Mata's impalas
Do that with or without the ... going inside of me
Hop out the ride and empty the 45 into his body
I'm not to be fucked with
Whether I'm straight out of Compton
Or straight out of Cashville with that Young Buck shit
Terrorizing Whoo Kid 24/7
'til 1 of you niggas put me with Eazy in heaven

[Hook]
