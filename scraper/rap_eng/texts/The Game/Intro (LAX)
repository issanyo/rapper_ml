In the name of Jesus, let us pray

Father, we thank you for waking us up this morning
We thank you for surrounding us with your guardian angels as we slept
We thank you for waking our family, friends and loved ones as well
Keeping us safe
We thank you for waking our enemies this day, father, for they are your children, as we are

Lord I, Earl Simmons, stand in a gap for Jayceon Terrell Taylor
And pray that he is continued as a child of yours
He is continued in your grace
He is continued with the blessings that you bless so many others with
In the name of Jesus
We pray that any obstacle that the Devil plans to place in our path will be moved in the name of Jesus' father
Every spirit, everything that, of you that we come against right now, father
Every spirit of addiction
Every spirit of anger
Every spirit of jealousy
Every spirit of deception
Every spirit of greed
Every spirit of envy
Every spirit of lust we come against right now, in the name of Jesus' father

Let us say:
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
Devil! We rebuke you in the name of Jesus!
