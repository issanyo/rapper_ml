[Hook]
Baby make me want to be with you
Baby me come with me I take you for a ride
Baby, can we drive until the morning
Baby come with me I take you for a ride

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna go hard in the phantom
Hit Sunset Boulevard in the phantom
I'm talking 6-7 broads in the phantom
Yeah coming out their bra's in the phantom
I got a bottle of Cristal in the phantom
I'm waving my black card in the phantom
Niggas lookin real hard at the phantom
Cause tune make a beat go hard in the phantom
Shit what if it was y'all in the phantom
You probably just hit the mall in the phantom
But not me I'm a ball in the phantom
Yeah, Kobe, Gasol in the phantom
Plus I'm 6'5 sittin tall in the phantom
Dre lookin for me tell him call in the phantom
I'm a boss in the phantom
Rick Ross in the phantom
I know it's Maybach so pardon the phantom

[Hook]
Baby make me want to be with you
Baby me come with me I take you for a ride
Baby, can we drive until the morning
Baby come with me I take you for a ride

[Verse 2]
I smoke so much haze in the phantom
You would think my nigga just blaze in the phantom
So I blaze in the phantom
Till I'm dazed in the phantom
Smoke like Frankie Beverly and Ma$e in the phantom
You should've seen my nigga Dr Dre in the phantom (chop chop)
Nigga had his chef and maid in the phantom
He lemme spent a couple days in the phantom
Me and the chaffeur got laid in the phantom
Killer hip hop dot com
Now paid in the phantom
Close shades in the phantom
Only thing a nigga can't do is bath in a phantom
And he tryna D Wade in the phantom
Bulletproof doors, can't get sprayed in the phantom
I grew up getting dropped off to school in the phantom
Short skirts in the phantom
Rose in the phantom
Girl you out the front door and chanelle in the phantom
Six inch red button louis vitton in the phantom
Drop you out first class g5 in the phantom
Pick you up, take you home, my mansion in the phantom
Cars so fly take off from Atlanta
Brought Game in the phantom
Brought weight in the phantom
My sex and the cities, mr Bigg in the phantom
You can spend cake and eat it too in the phantom
Gettin so wet it's a pool in the phantom
No hoes in in the phantom
So hoe in the phantom
Party like motherf*ckin One Oak
In the phantom

[Hook]
Baby make me want to be with you
Make me come with me I take you for a ride
Baby, drive
Baby come with me I take you for a ride
