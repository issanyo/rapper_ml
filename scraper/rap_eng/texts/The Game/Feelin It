Most of these rap niggas be fakin, i'm talkin the throng chases
I diss em on any basis, throw patrons and steal my faces
Stay running like jamaicans, the Marleys puffing the finest cheeba
Fuckin the finest divas, if I have it, I'd like to meet cha
Show you how I light the streets up, kill niggas that never speak up
You my fans, sit in the stands and watch me rip these beats up
Like a legend, feel my presence like the dead ones
If I die, my only wish is my face on some Air-1s
My soles curled, my baby mamas they drive sixes
As for my bitches, theres other rappers out there that's trickin
My only mission was to sell a couple records
Buy a bentley and drive reckless, a big medallion on my necklace
I seen Daddy Kane and Rakim do it, so much respect kid
Hip Hop is dead because you new niggas dont get the message
I used to call names out, you niggas dont deserve it
So lame out, die from these bullets outta Game's mouth

Chorus

My flow polished, I studied the legends
Hip Hop scholar kick knowledge
Get dollars, you got some work then holla
Im on the block pitchin
Most of us got riches, not trippin
Work hydrolics and fuck the hot bitches
Youngins dont stop wishin
If you got a block then flip it
Just because i'm blood dont mean my niggas should stop crippin
We from the ghetto
We came up without a pot to piss in
We gettin money stayin blunted
Cuz the clock is tickin
You got a rock then pitch it
You got a Glock then lift it
Them G-unot t-shirts make them niggas stop snitchin
Forever ballin' I'm Jim Jones
With rims on that blue aston martin, interior like my skin tone
Most of these rappers want me dead, shit I been gone
Too classic, move rapid, my jewish black kid
The first 8 letters and everything that I stand for
Colder than a New York block, shut the damn door

Chorus

Niggas callin me back for an encore, like i'm eminem
I disappear niggas like spinnin rims, who the fuck want a war? Meet us at the corner store, call it the hot spot
Where gangbangers throw hot rocks
The boys comin, so what, they pop cops
Push them hot drops
Hop out with them shirts on that say we got rocks
High school dropout stayed to air the block out
Stack paper like the old G's told us
We only chirp on Nextels
Dont talk on the Motorolas
Gotta feel that, so kick back
And scope up what im sayin
Picture me parlaying
Im flippin bricks while you eatin pussy
You chicken shit
I fuck bitches on Natime
I chow on Nadime
Gettin head under the table
Everybody stay calm
