[Verse 1: The Game]
Every time I come around we get lit
Especially when a nigga on that Compton shit
My Impala, my hoes green, my pockets fat, my gun long
Nigga tell me what the fuck niggas mean when they say (they say)
I ain't gonna pull up and let this motherfucker spray
30 shots in the passenger side, I don't stick around
I don't give a fuck who died that day, he gon' die that day (die that day)
Every time a bitch come she gon' turn up with me (turn up with me)
In the club wherever, fuck V.I.P (fuck V.I.P)
I got 12 bottles of whatever, tellin' niggas it's whatever
Everything I do is better than you fuck niggas (fuck niggas)
Man fuck niggas (man fuck niggas), man fuckboys, nigga fuck hoes
Nigga 45 we tuck those (we tuck those)
She give me head (she give me head), that's cutthroat (cutthroat)
She leave with me (she leave with me), that's tough bro
Out

[Bridge: Forever MC]
I do this shit my way (my way)
You do this shit my way (my way, my way)
We do this shit my way (my way, my way)
We do it my way

[Chorus]
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my way (hol' up)
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way

[Verse 2: Forever MC]
Fuck around and you miss this, suck the crown and you kiss this
Stuck in town and you twist this, luck is down and you diss this
Got two plugs like an outlet, got loud money you shout debt
My lowest goal get mad rich, your highest goal: have a bad bitch
See I run my life no sad shit, my head in her box that's Brad Pitt
She roll with me no fee flat, 'loyalty to a T' stat
I see that, bleed that, she fuck with me, I need that
She fuck with me, I need that (she fuck with me, I need that)

[Bridge: Forever MC]
I do this shit my way
You do this shit my way
We do this shit my way
We do it my way

[Chorus]
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em up my, my, my, my way (hol' up)
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way

[Verse 3: KXNG Crooked]
Every time I come around we get lit
Especially when I'm on that LBC shit
My gun long, my paper long, them haters gone, they where they belong
What the fuck you niggas mean when y'all say? (what?)
I won't cook you up with that AK, that'll hook you up to that IV
Your family look you up, you in ER all day (what?)
That's for livin' that rider life, y'all know what them eastsiders like
Sometimes I wonder am I a psycho like (um)
Am I really in my right mind, when I'm tryna get my mind right
With tequila and a light lime, while I'm livin' in the limelight
I'm just waitin' on the right time, 'till then get my time right
That's a watch with a bright shine, let a real nigga shine bright
Eastside, Crooked I, baby it's me, I'm out here eatin' like a table for three
A nigga gotta wear a durag on a surfboard if he ever wanna be wavy as me
I'm lookin' for a ride or die chick, after I find a hoe I'ma go dynamite stick
I don't know why the hoe sittin' on my testicle like a potato
This ain't Idaho, get out of my shit
Gotta go hard like that 'cause nowadays bitches take pictures while you sleepin'
Let the whole world know you creepin', got me and my other bitches beefin'
As soon as they fell in love I ran, fuck 'em all day long, what's my plan
Soon as it got dark, I became an instant Eminem fanatic, one night stan

[Chorus]
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin'' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my way (hol' up)
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
Draggin' 'em my, my, my, my, my, my way
