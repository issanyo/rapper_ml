[The Game: Hook]
I got big money I drive big cars
Everybody know me
It’s like I’m a movie star
Everybody know me
It’s like I’m a movie star
Everybody know me
It’s like I’m a movie star
(x2)

[Verse 1]
I got big money, everybody know
Brand new rose phantom, put those sixes on the floor
When I pull up in the hood, niggas say there go the man
I put them Asanti’s and Nelly’s on them rubberbands
California license plates, Aftermath logo
Back with the Doc after a 5 year solo
Woke up in the club 10 bottles of the bub
Tell them hoes, I'm buying what they drinking
Just pour it up, all my niggas is banging
What you claim just throw it up
If you ain't getting money like I'm getting, go get a cup
If you ain't getting pussy like I'm getting, take one of mine
You know I'm in this bitch with 20 dollars worth of dimes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm from Compton, everybody know
I ain't riding on LeBron’s thats 2004
I ain't riding on Kobe’s thats 2005
If it ain't February’s on the truck it ain't right
Don't ask what I'm sitting on, mills on the rims
Lamborghini top unless I call it Lil' Kim
Walking through the club with a pocket full of change
Iceberg on my chest no man on my ring
I ain't talking bout Jeezy, talking bout them gemstones
Medallion so big think I'm walking with my rims on
Tell the DJ we got a line outside
You can play it after Gucci and Dre, just let it ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Girl lets make a movie, hop inside my car
I be Denzel and you can be just who you are
Ain't worried bout ya man
Leave that nigga at the bar
Got some tint on my Ferrari, This movie is rated R
Ya girlfriends is extra’s, Baby you a star
And its time to burn rubber no stuntman involved
Doing a 100 on the highway, pulling on my gear shift
Your girl got her hand on my cock but I ain’t Will Smith
Baby I’m a baller, inside outside
Cool N Dre track and this motherfucker bounce, right?
Yeah it’s aftermath and we back in the club
While you wait for Detox, let this motherfucker suck

[Hook]
