[Swizz Beatz] (3x)
Aim for the head
When you see 'em go get 'em nigga
[Cassidy]
Yo game let them lames know you ain't playin' wit 'em

[The Game]
I got my slugs on
Gettin my thug on
New Era, brim low
Giovanni rims oh
Phantom got curtains, you can't see through the tints so
Bought a .45 put the barrel on the window
It's me and Swizzle fo' shizzle
V twizzle the pistols
Cock it back if you carry a missle
Can't cross both of your arms, nigga fold em back
If you miss Soulja Slim do the Nolia Clap
Or recline the seats in the rover back
Yeah it's me and young Cass' 'til Hov come back
You wanna see us both dead, then load your gat
You be the first nigga to bring penny loafers back
Why niggas wanna see me R-I-P
Empty the clip in a nigga before I D-I-E
Prayin on my downfall like B-I-G
I be in the cockpit ridin dirty like T-I-P
Po-po pull me over wanna see I-D
Searchin my shit tryin to find my 3 times 3
They don't know I got 4 times 4 in the backseat
Wit enough bodies on it to get a nigga 5 times 5
Other niggas snitch on em
Like if he got the rover parked crooked in the front
He might have bricks on em
I'll send a lil' back like the brother of Rich Porter
Run up on you and give you a buck fifty like six quarters
Yeah

[Cassidy]
Shit real, I know how baggin a whole brick feel
Big deal, hit the garage and switch wheels
My chicks real, with the m√©nage and tip drills
Gimme a massage, yeah show me how them lips feel
I shinin' cause I'm grindin' on the strip still
And I grip steel, still keep the clips still
Everything I spit real
Everything I spit ill
Everything I spit sick, for real ain't shit switch
Ain't shit changed, like Rick James I'm rich bitch
Get change big chain the wrist glist
I'm with Game, I'mma make cake like bisquick
My album went gold in a month, that was a quick flip
Dont say shit bitch, cause niggas wit the lip get
Er'y one in the gun til it go click click
Then I'mma switch clips and squeeze like toothpaste
Palm over my forearm so I can shoot straight
I'm 'bout to make it hard to eat like toothaches
My flow dope like I go in the booth and shoot base
Duece duece the skates in the coupe great
Im not broke I cop coke by the suitcase
My boots laced I got base and them white ki's
'Bout to cop a convertible crib, like Ice-T's
And that ice on your sleeve thats light cheese
I spend a 100 g's a year on white tees

[The Game] (2x)
If you wanna go to war then pop somethin
If you wanna go to war then pop somethin
If you wanna go to war then pop somethin
You can't afford a swizz track nigga stop frontin
