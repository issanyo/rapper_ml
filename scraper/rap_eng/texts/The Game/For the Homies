[Hook: MICAH]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

[Verse 1: The Game]
Lil Frogg, nigga, I miss you
Your momma still wish she could kiss you
I talked to all the homies, yeah, all the homies
Swear that day we wish that we was with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rosecrans
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an Olde E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here, with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big Frogg and the truck niggas sick
All the homies on the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Some of the homies trying to blame a bitch
Cause he was riding on sky today, he died
Wrong place, wrong time, nigga fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did
Took a good daddy away from seven kids

[Hook: MICAH]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

[Verse 2: Payso]
Still riding around through the city looking for an enemy
Still riding around through the city thinkin' 'bout all the memories
Thinking back like God damn
All them niggas really really livin me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's designer, in the ghost that they chauffeur me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they didn't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song somebody wrote for me
But I got the GOAT in me, I got the truth in me

[Hook: MICAH]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
