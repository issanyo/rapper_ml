[Mario Winans]
Yea (ugh)
Sharissa (ugh)
Yellow City
Yo' Game... kick game

[The Game]
I need a gangsta *bitch* like Apache
Wife beater, Von Dutch khakis
Not a hood rat she
Know when we out I'm behind that vest
Cause I'm the man behind the Roc like Kanye West
I'm a gangsta ma', I'll light ya wrist up
Red and blue diamonds on that *blood* and *crip* stuff
Pump on my lap I'll light this *bitch* up
Low riding through NY with Sharissa
TILTIN'!

[Sharissa]
I'm still hot like  fire
Still down like four flat tires
Even hit a high note like Mariah
And make it pop like grease on the fire

[Chorus: Sharissa]
I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gotta bounce to this

I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gonna bounce to this

[Sharissa]
Hair and my nails done, oh yes
Walk in the club, looking so fresh
Cartier frames, did you notice?
I wonder how my ice stay frozen

Hands in the air
Drinks everywhere
We don't care
Who you wit', dance, who you wit'

Hands in the air
Drinks everywhere
We don't care
Who you wit', just bounce to this

[Chorus: Sharissa]
I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gotta bounce to this

I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gonna rock to this

[The Game]
Eighteen, the truth hurts so I got to have you
And you shake that *ass* like you the daughter of Matthew
So let me be Hov for a minute
Get up in your *hole* for a minute
You can be my *ho* for a minute
Like I'm Diddy, be J. Lo for a minute
From the windows to the wall, get low while I'm in it
All I gotta do is hit 'em with a Jay-Z line
Like, "You deserve to be my sunshine."

[Chorus: Sharissa]
I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gotta bounce to this

I'm heat, I'm hot, this beat gon' drop
Everybody burnin' up when it bump in the club
I really don't care if you a chick or a thug
You still gonna rock to this

[Sharissa]
I'm still hot like fire
(Oh yes...so fresh)
I'm still hot like fire
(Oh yes...so fresh)
I'm still hot like fire
(Oh yes...so fresh)
