[Intro: The Game]
See the bitches be wanting a thug
But the ladies be wanting a gentleman
If you don't want to fuck with a thug
I suggest you ride with Ne-Yo

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
This sex appeal, can't be bought
It's not a skill, can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you, then please be off
This sex appeal, can't be bought
It's not a skill, can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you, then please be off
Then please be off

[Verse 1: The Game]
Fuck this old nigga whistling for, outside my door?
Apartment 5B, where I learn to cook my first ounce of raw
Use to whistle while I work, she whistle while she twerk
Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt, it can't hurt
While you wet and come up out that skirt, bend over, make it squirt
You can be my Superhead, maybe we should try that first
Let me whistle while you jerk, run my hand up ya shirt
If you with it, say you with it, let me hear my birdies chirp (we like it!)
"Estupido, porque tu miras a mis amigas asi?
Puto maricon, tu vas a ver Game, tu vas a ver"
Back shots make a bitch go berserk
The Game will make it hurt, T-Pain know I'm a flirt (and we love it!)
Get your ass up and fuck me then
I know you brought your girls, girl, fuck your friends
Matter of fact I want to fuck your friends
Naw, I ain't mean it like that, shit

[Hook: Ne-Yo & The Game]
This sex appeal, can't be bought
It's not a skill, can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you, then please be off
This sex appeal (it can't be bought)
It's not a skill (and it can't be taught)
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you then please be off
Go 'head bitch, be off

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
There's the door
Swag's a standard, no less no more
If you have none, let Neezy know
Cause that's all, they checkin fo'
Flashing paper, playa' stop it
Swag is in you, not in ya pocket
Tryna buy her, ain't goin' fly
Cause she want smooth, gentleman life
She likes the way that everything
I do is so fresh and so clean
My phone is free, no need to scream
Boss like Damine, not her, not me

[Hook: Ne-Yo & The Game]
This sex appeal, can't be bought
It's not a skill, can't be taught
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you, then please be off
This sex appeal (it can't be bought)
It's not a skill (and it can't be taught)
This is a gentleman's affair
If that's not you then please be off
Go 'head bitch, be off

[Verse 3: The Game]
It can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see no dividends like three times dope
And that's triple X rated, you know?
My bitches only want the weed, some X, some blow
Know not to ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick, no dough, she give me shit, she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then, this is now, lift it up, break it down
I go in, she come out, that's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same, every time you fuck with Game
Silk sheets, long dick, hot tub, Lil Wayne
Like I ain't never ran from no pussy
And I damn sure bout to pick today to start running
I said I ain't never ran from no pussy
And I damn sure bout pick today to start running
