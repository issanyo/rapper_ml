We gon meet some ladies tonight

[Hook: Mele]

Cause we got so much Spades and we got so many cars
We go shoppin' for days
Everybody goin' cray, we gon party for weeks
I said that money never sleeps and

We gon meet some ladies tonight
Cause we got so much Spades and we got so many cars
We go shoppin' for days
Everybody goin' cray, we gon party for weeks
I said that money never sleeps and
We gon meet some ladies tonight

We gon meet some ladies tonight
We gon meet some ladies tonight
We gon meet some ladies tonight (you're comin' home with me baby)

[Game]
I said I do I do I do I do I do, you know I do
Red Phantom, peanut butter guts, Winnie the Pooh
You know I got that honey with me, playboy bunny with me
She got a Kevin Hart, always actin funny with me
Said she far from perfect but I love her though
And I would love her even if she was an undercover ho

Notice she carry that thang fo' me, notice she movin' her ass
She got kids but that's her past, took my hand and took my glass

I ain't focused on the flaws, I'm just focused on the draws
I compliment her rather that I don't get no pussy at all
She love the niggas that rat, she hate the niggas that ball
I'm 'bout to have a casting call and
We gon' meet some ladies tonight

[Hook: Mele]

Cause we got so much Spades and we got so many cars
We go shoppin' for days
Everybody goin' cray, we gon party for weeks
I said that money never sleeps and

We gon meet some ladies tonight
Cause we got so much Spades and we got so many cars
We go shoppin' for days
Everybody goin' cray, we gon party for weeks
I said that money never sleeps and
We gon meet some ladies tonight

We gon meet some ladies tonight
We gon meet some ladies tonight
We gon meet some ladies tonight (you're comin' home with me baby)
[Verse 2: Game]
How many women in the club got a nine to five?
Ain't had a break in days, know you need that glass of Spades
Girl you know I got it for you, know I got more than one
And we gon make that nigga jealous when that photo done
So take that picture girl, just make sure you smile
And text your babysitters, you know we gon be a while
And we can do whatever, go to MIA and chill
You try to travel, stay with him, I bet you never will
But hell na, he ain't tryna lose you cause the head is real
And all he wanna do is go in circles like a ferris wheel
That nigga sellin' dreams, I got a better deal
So girl come with me

[Hook: Mele]

Fuck with me cause I done ordered all these bottles for ya
Baby fuck with me cause I'm blowin' all these money on ya
Baby fuck with me cause I done ordered all these bottles for ya
Baby fuck with me cause I'm blowin' all these money on ya
