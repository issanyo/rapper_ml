[Verse 1: The Game]
Yo I’m in NY York on the block, I know you see that it’s snowing
Jesus Piece, got Jesus piece, both of the shits glowin’
Stussy jacket, hoodie on, fucking wind blowin
G start, Jordan 3's fly like Bowen
And now that I got everybody fuckin attention
Let address this bitch ass nigga going on the Kendrick'
Said that album trash, nigga you full of gas
Poke holes in you, let you fill up the New-York cab'
Nigga in believes, all into his feeling
Cause he did 10 years for shootin at the ceiling
Diddi gave you a mill, lil nigga should’ve chilled
Cute curly side-burns talkin bout it real
Check my resume, any nigga want it - I bury him
But fuck this nigga, he can't get into America
I’m ‘bout to hit Brooklyn, fuck on his bitch Erica
Bust a nut, call a cabbie cut
After I tear it up and we just meditate
Gave it a pole, the day after election date
Bitches was on section 8, tryina get a section 8
Already came, this a rap like a ..
Hurricane Sandy got this bitch lights out
She fell asleep then a girl got piped out
It means the type hoes, NBA niggas wife out
And these my side bitches, nigga what your life 'bout
Mine's bout, gunz in the stash, the Chrys' piped out
That's 300C and Christ iced out
3 kids, all 3 closets Nike'd out
And I'm biopolar, see 40 block lights out
Word on the street – bitch niggas suing me
Sent the cops to my door nigga' how you a G?
I ain’t beefin with the pigs, this you and me
And I spit the same 16 at your eulogy

Cough up a lung, where I'm from
Compton son, ain't nothing nice!
