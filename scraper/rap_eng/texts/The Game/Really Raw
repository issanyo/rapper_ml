[Tyga]
Uh, in this world after one thing
Get your money man, like my uncle told me
Haven’t slept since, cause my dreams real big
I ain't even rich yet, so get up off my dick bitch
Oh shit haters through the mist, on some g-shit
Low clip, pop gun, hot toast, brutal shit
You a little noodle drip, watch a shark eat the fish
Ever seen piranha, it’s like the movie jaws again
Leave a nigga barbershop, chop his top, head gone
Too fly, three strong, nick name, gold bones
What the fuck you boys want
Roll on you like a joint
Talk behind a nigga back but muthafucka don’t you point

[Pharrell]
KFC by the bucket, thats really raw
AK’s you can’t tuck it, thats really raw
Watching porno’s on the iPad, thats really raw
Lamborghini’s with the wide back, it's really raw

[Tyga]
It’s that raw from the Crippers, Pyru’s and strippers
Homie, you could tip her, but I already get her
Harder than I did her, same shit, get no different
Ain't no fun if the homies can’t hit it
Bitches, ice cold heart make you shiver
I got the flow, make summer turn winter
Ch-ch-chilly raw cheese steak made up in Philly
I come in peace like a hippie
Piece on my chain, grandma say that silly
The new sports car, retard, Timmy
Watching porno’s on the ipad, illy
Tryna follow my style, don’t get dizzy muthafucka what you know ’bout

[Pharrell]
Jerseys with the stealers, that's really raw
20 niggas on four wheelers, that's really raw
Going green, thats so cool, that's really raw
My jacket smell like jet fuel, it’s killing y’all

[Snoop]
Just bought a ’77 baby blue Cadillac
Run it down, set it off, let it off, get back
Diss this twist, this is one of my flavas
Guerilla’s, lions and tigers, they all of my neighbours
Swinging from a vine, like step in my limelight
My kids and my wife and my life got my mind right
Now, what do you do when they spray with the AK
Retaliate nigga cause ya life full of melee
We got the heat for the street, let me that dough
Ya boy talkin like we don’t know
Blast pass with the forks, no you rollin’ with the locusts
Been the pimpest and the hippest and I’ve always been the dopest
Peep my style

[Pharrell]
Louis bags you can’t order, thats really raw
Miami cribs on blue water, thats really raw
Blood making the game redder, thats really raw
Nigga we hot like Mayweather, it’s killin’ y’all
P stand for Pacquiao nigga

[Game]
California Nas
I’m more raw than red snapper in the pacific ocean
More raw than the brick as soon as you split it open
Talkin’, the kitchen smokin
Talkin’ the pots bubbling
I got the blueberry on deck but not muffins
My Glock stuffed in my Levi’s
My Levi's on the buttersoft leather
Panamera 4-door Porsche
My chick named Portia
They two in the same, my stick game is torture
Monday night raw, got niggas in figure four locks
Hit the block Y-O, you would think it was four Lox
I don’t rap for Billboard spots
I just wanna fuck as many bitches as I can and cop some more drops
Raw

[Pharrell]
Gargling with champagne, thats really raw
Classic millionaire frames, thats really raw
White tee’s and Jordan 3′s, thats really raw
Windmilling with them shits on, killin’ y’all
Nigga, raw
