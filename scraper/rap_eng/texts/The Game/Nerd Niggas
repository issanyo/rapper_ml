[Intro: Slim 400]
Play opp
DJ
Suck it clique
Bitch, you now what it is
Ya know what I mean?
Let that nigga live both his fuckin' lives
No lie

[Verse 1: Slim 400]
Okay
It's easy to stay ignant, send bullets through your pigment
Double 'round the block, make sure the job finished
Racks on your head like a nigga playin' tennis
Steve Urkel ass nigga, we ain't fuckin' wit'cha image
Emulatin' the culture, we the best that done did it
Nerd ass nigga like Jackie goin' swimmin'
Slim 400 from the start to the finish
West side capitols, ain't no room for no gimmicks
I be really in that Bompton, city where them G's at
Slime with that tootie, play wit' me, I squeeze that
Better have your pass 'fore I bust, you gon' need that
West to the East, we goin' up, we want feedback
And your bitch missin' a heart, she on a lie from the start
She a IG model, she fuck me in her nigga car
I'm in the Wraith Benz, no fake friends with an army [?]
And when they thinkin' of West coast, they thinkin' of that nigga Slim
400

[Chorus]
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
I don't feel sorry for you, we don't feel sorry for you
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
We don't feel sorry for you, I don't feel sorry for you

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I got all kinda spots
Niggas shot me, they got my partners hot
No feelings, we cold killin', see what'cho momma got
Home invasion, blue strips, you know I'm chasin'
The homie on parole, I just got off probation
Legend and I'm still alive
Ask me where I'm from, I throw this shit up in your face
And two thumbs up, middle fingers to the opposition
Couldn't describe my vision, I ain't have a pot to piss in
Or a window to throw it out
Blue flaggin', rollin' out
Call my nigga Slim, I'm in LA wit' a hunnid out
Gucci to the shoe strings, we gangbangin', fuck a mood swing
From the dirt, nigga, wit'cho boo me
I done made a million writin' on the Loose Leaf
Blue shirt, blue sneaks, Glock kicked back like Bruce Lee
Might kill a homie, he just ran off with a hunnid pack
Face shot his momma, can't stomach that, ain't no comin' back

[Chorus]
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
I don't feel sorry for you, we don't feel sorry for you
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
We don't feel sorry for you, I don't feel sorry for you

[Verse 3: The Game]
Nerd nigga, never sold a bird nigga
Never got your boxers dirty handcuffed on the curb nigga
Fuck twelve, fuck the cops, fuck the po-po
I hot the main line solo
What's brackin'?
Six-five, two fifty, nigga, what's happenin'?
We could start a prison riot, put that shit on All-Madden
I'm like the ghost of Pac, the Dame of rock
Twelve five, I ain't forgot, yeah
I put them thangs in the Buick like a window shield
Why you textin'? I done been through it
I don't trust no hoe, I don't trust no nigga
Ask me what time it is, I just might pull the trigger
Pour some liquor for my niggas in the sky, Blood
Do it Big like I been Ready To Die, blood
Kill me? It's gon' be black genocide, blood
Pull the roots out your family tree on the P, what?

[Chorus]
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
I don't feel sorry for you, we don't feel sorry for you
Polished chicken on the neck, that's imaginary
You don't come out the house, you was born scary
Nerd nigga
Put on at the library
We don't feel sorry for you, I don't feel sorry for you
