[Intro]
Somebody call my lawyer
New York stand up (we take money we don't take tests)
Where my hustlers at?
Dope boys
My drug dealers

[Hook]
These niggas playing cops and robbers
My niggas playing cops and robbers
They caught you slipping, they gon' rob you
We talking hail Mary (???) x4
We catch you slipping, nigga
We talking hail Mary (???)

[Verse: 1]
Assalam to my New York niggas
Call em (???)
(??) just ride through
(???) just shoot a nigga

We ride harder on this East coast
