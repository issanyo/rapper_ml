Homey, it's hard not to kill *** it's like a full time job
Not to pull out the *** and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in your *** for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you *** need Massengill
See I'm the ***, one shot'll lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so *** 6 4
Your *** know, hop in the back when you see Swizz
Diss that, all you *** get up off my *** so
I can cook *** on the track and watch it mix slow
*** my flow fire, call it propane
Every *** know Game, five *** no pain
And that's the reason why I'm *** on you ***
Shut me in the loony bin, I'm sicker than you ***
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up *** lay down
Where skinny *** make buff *** victims of that *** pound
And *** is the sharp ***, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his *** down and take the money out his tube socks
West Coast *** is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I *** a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest *** make money with the smartest ***
I ain't got time for you *** artist ***
Better shut your trap before you become a target
Y'all army brats, I'm the *** sergeant
Beauty pageant *** on the runway
'Boyz N The Hood' 'til they see the *** in that red Hyundai
Blow his *** back out 'cause I'm the rap Stackhouse
Black Wall Street, *** the hip hop *** house, what?
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the *** cancer
One man show 'cause I *** all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These *** let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean, mean, rappin' machine
Red rag hangin' low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
0 7 Bugatti with Jimmy Lovine's secretary
I'm runnin' the buildin', don't make me run in the buildin'
No, this ain't the first time I had my *** in the buildin'
Walkin' past offices, I see my son in the buildin'
Last album on the wall, I'm number one in the buildin'
They should build me an office up under the buildin'
My elevator goin' down, I am done in the buildin'
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
This is that disrespectful, *** West Coast
Hip hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go
We in the *** buildin', man
You ain't got your *** mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out
Your *** mind right *** wassup?
It is what the *** it is, man
How y'all wanna cut the cake?
You touch this, you get your hands cut off
Swizz Beatz, the *** monster
Game is in the *** buildin'
We could turn this whole *** world red
