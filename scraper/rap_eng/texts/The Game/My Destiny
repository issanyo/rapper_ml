[Intro: 2Pac]
I appreciate that... I went to jail and
They made me number one..
I appreciate them stickin' up
For me when everyone was kickin
Me when I was down... That's love and
I'll never trade that..so for the Bay
And Philly and all those areas and all those
Ghettos and towns..I love y'all..
Don't let this east coast west coast thing get to you...

[Verse 1: The Game]
Sometimes I try to do good but I just can't be
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me
And y'all should thank me
But my haters busy trying to send me home early
But you can't New Orlean Saint me
I ain't a saint B, I ain't a god God
I ain't a angel neither but I try hard y'all
I'm lighting up for all my soldiers at war
As I sit back and watch
The ashes on my cigar fall
They say death comes in threes
Who's next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and
"Soo Woo!" when it's reppin' time
Y'all don't understand.. I'm misunderstood
Give Interscope two more albums
Then I'm done for good
Sold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood
It's a cold world, everybody need a hood

[Hook: 2Pac]
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
After realizing, to master enterprising
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Began to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missing
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustlers Prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college grant so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase sky's the limit
Motherfuckers
