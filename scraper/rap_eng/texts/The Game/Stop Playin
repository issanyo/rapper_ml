[Hook: Skeme]
Girl give me that pussy stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
Girl give me that pussy stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Right, I'm tryna see you get ratchet with your fine ass
But it's still purge first, show your fine ass
Your Rolly tic-tac, nigga where you find that?
Boy why you say you had them racks with your lyin' ass?
I can see a hella hater nigga Helen Keller
Stackin' dollars, so I dream all that I could sell it
If she givin' me that pussy then I don't wanna smell it
Magic trick, make it disappear, Penn and Teller
I take my bae up to the bay, [?]
Nigga with a attitude, MC Ren and Yella
My older bitch good and she call me a Goodfella
I might help her get her groove back like I'm fuckin' Stella
Pull up in that new coupe, hollering out whoop
And I'm riding with them shooters nigga word to the troops
Say you getting paper nigga, we gon' need some proof
And before I lose my bitch I lose my mind and my roof

[Pre-Hook: Eric Bellinger]
From the window to the wall
The club to the life we ball
Our niggas ain't scared, not at all
I tear it up, tear it up
Stop playin' with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
Man her pussy like a chopper, it just keep on busting
I might pass her to my woadie cause your bitch ain't nothing
A broke bob and a dumb bob, one in a same
Got some good head on her, she ahead of the game

[Verse 3: The Game]
They playin with a nigga, cuh my name Game though
Pull that dirty harry out, bullets in your Range door
Take a cuff nigga, show the whole hood his rainbow
If we ain't killin' niggas then what the fuck we came for?
Niggas they ain't say, chuck me on these hoes though
So I looked at my enemy table and I chose four
Now I got that nigga hoes with my hoes
They happy cos they ain't gottta ride home in that Tahoe
10 minutes ago she was your wife, now she my ho
Keep the kids, can't fit 'em inside that Murcielago
Play 'em just the ladies ho, you know she close that 'cedes door
Give her '97 dick but I'm a '80s baby though
Text my baby mama, why you actin' crazy though?
Throwin' M&Ms, she ain't even signed to Shady though
Blood, I ain't never gettin' married
Cause that shit gay and I ain't Tyler Perry
I'm blood
