[Intro]
You know what I wanna do
Lyrica, Right now
Oh the way we grindin', got you all excited
B-buzzin', b-buzzin'

[Verse 1: The Game]
You know i'm with it
And I ain't trippin' of the pussy, cause I already hit it
Next, I tryna fuck one in the crew
And yeah i'm petty, you know how niggas in the circle do
Me and your girlfriend lie about it
Why you cryin' 'bout it act like you never cheated on a nigga
Yeah, you know I do my shit
It ain't cheatin' if i'm right back to you 'bout 6
Yeah, we break up to make up, but I ain't tryna hurt you
If you ain't tryna lose me, stay in the winner circle
Throw on the snap-back, bring some of your girls through
Put that ass on a nigga and bang it like Piru

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
Oh the way we grindin', got you all excited
Maybe it's just nothing, maybe i'm just buzzin' off you
Oh-oh-oh-woah b-buzzin'
Oh-oh-oh-woah, maybe i'm just buzzin' off you

[Verse 2: Lyrica Anderson]
Throw it up, got the whole place goin' up

Get a cup, he on me like he want some
Wanna eat it like cake mix, huh
Fuck around let him taste it
Oh, I might leave with you tonight

[Chorus: Lyrica Anderson]
Oh the way we grindin', got you all excited
Maybe it's just nothing, maybe i'm just buzzin' off you
