[Intro: Jon Connor]
Yeah, yeah
Let me talk my shit
Nigga, this that 90 miles per hour on the freeway, nigga
This that motherfucking black hoodie shit, my nigga

[Verse 1: The Game]
Now we been baptized in a gunfire
These cops round here too motherfucking one sided
They fucking liars
Every time I hear these motherfucker's sirens blaring
I wanna put something through that badge
Hollow tips in your power steering
We say fuck cops and then them gun shots
All night we ducking them buck shots
We hear pop-pop! Nigga hop-pop!
You ainâ€™t strapped then homie why the fuck not?
Hearing guns cock, we hear one shot
It's a moment of silence for the whole block
Cause when one of us gone, it's like we all gone
Fuck that, yo I'm ready to fight!

[Verse 2: King Mez]
Cause I'm so tired of this same old shit
Feeling like I ain't got not rights
Every time I turn around them red and blue lights
Always fucking up my night
And me wanna load up and put all you pretty motherfuckers up in my sight
All up in my sight

[Hook: The Game & (Jon Connor)]
You done fucked up now
You done crossed that line
Wait till I come back
Ima bust that nine
Y'all thought that shit was fine
Till that shit go (braow!)
I done lost my mind
Niggas is bout to find out
(Somebody gone die tonight)
Fuck the police
Shit, fuck the police
(It's about to be a silent night)
All this blood on the streets man, fuck the police
(When that crowd ignite)
And unite like "Fuck the police!"
(better hug yo wife
Man fuck yo life!
Payback, payback)

[Verse 3: Justus]
I done lost my fucking son because of this bullshit
Now I'm at the pulpit because of what I did with that full clip
And the judge and the jury, so fucking full of shit
Do you know how many times
These mutherfuckers try to pull this shit?

[Verse 4: The Game]
And it's fucking murder
Hide behind your badge and get away with it
Thought it was protect and serve
But half the time that's really not the way it is
But you niggas got it coming
And you so outnumbered
It's bout to be a cold ass summer

[Hook]

[Outro: Lead Singer & Backing Choir]
(Base hook) x4
And I'll be on my knees
Praying for the day
That you remember me
You'll come back this way

(Lead going over repeating hook)
And who's gonna love me now, ay
Oh daddy why'd you let me down, down
Oh did you forget I was your flesh and blood
I need you to remember me

Ooh praying for the day
Cause Mama couldn't raise no man
And though she do the things she can
Every woman needs a helping hand
