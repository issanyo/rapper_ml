I'm your motherfucking father, faggots
Plus I'm your motherfucking faggot father
Plus I'm a fucking faggot that fucks you and laughs it off till I'm fucking your asthma problem
And that's some drastic motherfucker karma so pop an acid tab
Cause that's exactly what's up with you fucking faggots, you punk
To your fucking statements covered by these fucking magazines
All perked in our basements, til cunts just think that nothing matters
And you're wasted and smack the fuck out Rihanna
Guess that's what you get for your slut persona
That's what the world wants, a girl cunt that talks about how much she wants to [moans]

I'm about to blow my motherfucking brains out
Because it's cool, cause it's true, plus I want someone to fucking listen
And this is pretty much the only way you'll pay attention
Which is retarded if you think about it. But why think about it?
Why just knock it off your rocker, fuckin' drink and shout at
What's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet
Slit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music
Keep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit
Piss on the flag that has nurtured you
Offend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit
Loose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at
Cause you're the fuckin' gangster you claim to be aren't you?
Too fuckin' dangerous and harmful for just one statement or lawsuit
This money and label's painted across you
But that's not gonna make us remorseful
