Guess who's bizack
Wit an ounce of crizack
Or a black mizak fitted to the bizak
L.A. Dodgers kid's at
That's where my shit's at
Niggas want my life homey come get that
I'm tired of the rif-rat
Niggas better sit back
Cause when the guns come out they break like kit-kats
But if its beef break me of a piece
I eat that beat that I'm back on the streets
I got a whole lot of bitches to see
And I don't fuck any dub niggas bitches to me
And a bitch is a bitch thats just a simple fact
Next time I'm in town you gonna get me jacked
Send the baby daddy see how the kids react
When the daddy comes home and his ribs is cracked
And he files a lawsuit for a million flat
Fuck it I gotta deal wit that
That's just how it is

Chorus:

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

[Dr. Dre]
Guess who's back again
Straight out the C.P.T
D.O.C. D.R.E
Y'all know me wit the shit bangin'
I'm in the streets again
This west coast shit gettin' played again
Its a new season and
A lot of people waitin'
A lot of niggas hatin'
Whole lot of stipulation
It's Dre makin the beats
Puttin' riders on the floor
I gets dope I'm the Aftermath C.E.O
Half the world wanna see me flow
The other half wanna see me go
It won't happen muthafuckas
Dre still rappin muthafuckas
The streets still love him
Paid in full since "Deep Cover"
All three speakers still drumming
Beats still coming
Comptons version of "Feel Drumming"
Same Dre different strokes
Same six-tre different spokes
Same chronic just different smoke

Chorus:

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

It ain't easy being signed to Dre
I'm in the press so much I ain't got time to pray
It's been six months too long
Aftermath gotta move on
Now the beef wit me and 50 Cent gone
I told y'all not to fuck wit me
Ghost writer my pens got that murda inc
I feel kinda bad about murdaring Ja
What goes around comes around look at 50's shot (a'ight a'ight)
But fuck that nevermind that shit you did
You tryin' to sell albums I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Game you gonna respond to mister potatohead
I told I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Why scoop to a level that requires a shovel
That's like throwing ice cubes at the muthafuckin' devil
I left the group cause the group's too crowded
Now watch game finish his second album without him

Chorus:

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again

Dre ridin' again
Westside again
Go get your ties again
You muthafuckas still ain't take a vacation
If you come back then we go again
