They call me G4 Game
I got a G4 mane
Got 3-4 chains
If you step into the light
Then you can see more bling
I ain't into the hype
But the story of my life is directed by hype
Half a mil' on the Lambo, had to roll the dice
If she married to the game, tell that bitch throw the rice
Slip and fall in pussy, that's just the life
Ten thousand a month on child support, that should suffice
Chump change to a nigga who got it
Jump lanes witcha boo in Bugattis
And your boo in Bugattis
I'm from a era where, you ain't have it
You cocked your pistol and ran up on a nigga who got it
You don't want to see 10 Impalas pull up on Broadway
Chrome to your chin like you doin' pull ups on Broadway
Hurricane, Meek, Puff, Game through the hallway
30 million dollar crib, mile long hallways
All the way up, no all the way down
Servin' you clowns, I won't stop, won't stop now
Aftermath 'til the death of me
They call me The Game
Niggas won't stop reffin' me
J. Cruz, we on our shit
And all these haters they stay fallin' off my (my brother)
And my baby mama, her to
Hermes, got a new purse too
2 baby mamas, save the drama for somebody who care
Me I put the pistol to your *mother* fuckin' hair
You know me, you know I'm straight outta Compton
Some call it Bompton, tell 'em "Stay all the way up"
Don't matter if it's ese wit Blood
I got somethin', I'm in the strip club, makin' it rain
All these other rappers out here tryin' to make a game
I'm takin chains, and you heard about it
You gon' read about it
I'm in AOD, come and see about it
Throwin' money in the air
Soon as it hit the ground, I get a new wad and
Throw it all the way up
Yeah, I throw it all the way up
Drinking Ciroc 'til I throw all the way up
West side in the air, put it all the way up
Yeah, breakfast bars and we out
