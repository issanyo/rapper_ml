Dre, I see dead people

Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it

Let's take a ride in my 64' impala
I'm your California tour guide
Show where the police let BIG die
They call it Los Angeles, I call it suicide!
I took a bullet in the heart and survived
So hit the switch, lean back, and enjoy the ride
Make a right on Green Leaf, but don't look to the side
Them is Kelly Park Crips, they still mad Eazy Died
That Seattle mirror in the hat, Homie that's South Side
Where Serinas sister caught a strait bullet outside
Where they spray paint, baby layin in the street
You know Orlando Anderson from that death row beef
If you ever need some chronic take a trip to long beach
But there ain't no Bloods out there so take out your red strings
Insane and Rollin 20's Crips equal white sheets
Snoop will tell you, when it gets dark in the LBC its

Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it

Murda in the CPT
Ask Dre his brother Tyeree got murdered in the street
I lost my brother too back in 93'
Pull over at the next light, let me grab us an O.E
This is Suge knight's hood that's the Compton Swap meet
Them the homies had 2Pac dealin MOB
So we can walk across the street, eat
But I ain't tryin die for no hamburger
And Lueders Park got beef
Out here Bloods kill Bloods, and Crips kill Crips

So Esses sit kick back cuz they ain't got to do shit
When I was young they used to beef with Santana Blocc Crips
They'ed take black and brown pride and put it in a full clip
I know Compton ain't shit, but its home to me
I'm still a B-L-double O-D
When we get to my hood, ill show you how to throw up a P
But put your fucken hands down homie or its gonna be another

Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(or its)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it

We ain't even been threw Watts yet
The LAPD can't even walk threw the projects
Nigga's plant their seeds and bury a coffin
And flowers never grow when the Nickerson Gardens
Today there been 10 murders in South Central alone!
The boys in the hood said Cube been gone to long
So take my advice, im talking to all rappers
When you eat a Roscoe's watch out for the chain snatchers
Take it off slow, or you might get killed
If the Grape Streets don't catch you, the 60's will
Police don't give a fuck cuz they all renpark
And what happens in Crenshaw stays in Crenshaw
It's a jungle out there, but i take you to any hood. My brother is Mafia, yea I got family in inglewood
Welcome to Killafornia, its where I live
The zip code is 187 and the city is

Murda Murda, leave mine alone
Betta mind your own,(the reds)
Murda murda, When the heat is on
Betta ride with chrome(or its)
Murda Murda, If that beam is on
Your life is gone in it
