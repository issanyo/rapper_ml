[Game]
Niggas put my face on the milk carton, take the shit off
Cause I’ve been home with the kids instead of breaking shit off
I’m asthmatic, aftermath-matic, Dre want me in the booth
The room better be padded cause I’m Loko
Psychotic, six hundred wide body
Lost a couple mill last year, but why cry about it
Westside got a nigga back so I throw my dubs up
Never leave without my strap, it’s like that
Got palm tree’s, we comin’ through on three’s
The A-F-T-E-R-M-A-T-H nigga we got a army
Aftermath general, one love to fifty
Ain't seen him in a minute though, used to be my nigga yo
Money changed niggas, but we the same niggas
Add fuel to the fire, that makes the flame bigger
But sometimes ego’s clash with desert eagles
And I stayed loyal to the city where the weed grow (compton)
