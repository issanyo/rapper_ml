[Intro: DJ Skee]
When you hear that sound, you already know what time it is
I Only Drop classics and we back again with another one
The duo you love to hate
Live from Los Angeles The Game, I am (DJ SKEE)

[Verse 1: The Game]
I just want y'all to understand what I'm about to do
Keep it gangsta in this Louis Vuitton designer suit
In front of club Liv stuntin' in that Masi coupe
Then we're gonna check Chyna see what King of Diamonds do
Pass the kush to A.R. when I recline the roof
That nigga get down for me like I'm 'bout to shoot
Tell em' its Money Gang my nigga Sonic real
And Kid Red be running trains like a monorail
Introduce you to my team niggas you need to know
We popping spades the bottles look like C3PO
Blowing that loud security telling us to keep it low
But when you pay me for a walk through
This is what you need to know
We smoking all night Kev got a handle for me
And tell the owner that 12 bottles is mandatory
And we gon' need a few Cirocs and them Gooses too
Same go for Greenhouse and Dreams down in Houston too
Watching Malaya eating shrimp while I throw these ones
Jas drunk as fuck' cause every time I look he show his gun
Every time we at the strip club he got the coldest one
Surrounded by killers 'cause J-Prince know his son
And I'm aight with that 'cause Rap-A-Lot my fam
And every time J ask me can I dot dot? Yeah I can
'Cause he been looking out for me before the Drake co-sign
And I was there when him and Tune heard that Drake was gon' sign
But look at Drake now every time that I need something
He do it and say "Game holla if you need something"
And that's loyalty in an industry that's full of snakes
When niggas send a bottle to your table just to show they face
And bitches standing looking pretty just to get a glass of Ace
Most of these hoes dumb and ain't nothing but an ass and face
But if you are the ones thats lucky enough to stand up on this couch
Make sure as soon as we hop in that Phantom you got them titties out
I hate you fake hoes I swear I hate you fake hoes
Your fake ass, your fake nose, you never gon' be J-Lo
Nicki put you on that Mike Kors got you thinking
That you on the right course to fuck the nigga in that white Porsche
But I got news for you, got a wifey and three kids at home
And I can't even start to count how many times we've been to Rome
My oldest kid is 10 and some my youngest got his tennis on
And you ain't never seen a 4 year old swaggin in his Foams
Now they wanna be him 'cause he rocking colosseums
Used to rock it for the fiends now he rock with Europeans
All out in Dublin with them green bottles bubbling
Twins I call doublemint, they calling me by my government
I swear to god that I'm loving it
I'm on the beach with Miss Dominican Republic
Even she surprised that she sucking it
But don't be surprised that I'm fucking
Never cuffing, always puffin', these bitches know who they fucking with
I'm the fucking shit, handsome ass nigga
Fuck with me I'll fuck with her you gon' need ransom cash nigga
Now cancel that nigga like my BlackBerry service
Don't believe none of you niggas till them plaques start servicing
Niggas get nervous when we hop out them Suburbans
Get to tying red rags around our head like they turbans
After niggas murk 'em, I'm behind the Phantoms curtains
Headed to Greystone, my alibi is this Persian
Her alibi is this Asian, I call that a persuasion
From Hollywood lock up to yelling out bring the spades in
Dumb bitch right here wanna know why the bottle green
I'm something like them golf niggas, I done seen a lot of green
640 mil 'bout to play the lottery
A rich nigga can't win twice? Don't lie to me
'Cause I'm Donald Trumpin,' Feds trying to eye on me
Ain't no limit in spending this money I'm bout it bout it P
I'm who these new rappers trying to be
Every new nigga that say 'five' becomes a prodigy
And you should honor me, hang my jersey up? Sure!
We got a situation, nigga Jersey shore
Know I'm 'bout my occupation, know I'm 'bout fucking these hoes
Know I rock them Louboutins and smoke til its stuck on my clothes
And I got your girl in her comfortable clothes
I'm 'bout to tickle her with what's right up under my nose
Its money gang bitch, now watch my company blow
And go from a hot logo to something you know
I'm in the Maserati, Jordans punching the floor
And you can act like you don't nigga, but...

[Ending Verse: Mele]
Either I'm going too fast or doing too much
Shut it down all the time when I'm in the club
Ooohhhh, ooohhhh
Yeah I'm always in the zone chilling with a bad bitch
And she got nothing on, yeah I'm gonna do it, shut it down
Yeah I'm going too fast, so fast....
