[Intro: ]
Do you feel the tone?
Are we getting ready?
I’m gonna smack you up
And show no mercy

[1st Verse: ]
And the tone is set, all games are over
Set in stone, marble bet, no gamble for a copper
No life to suffer, no time to discuss it
No pain, no gain
You learnt it from your Nikes
And I called me luckless
Suffering luck's lackness
But fortune does exist
No myth of Loch Ness
It's more fresh than water
Get money in order to feel well
Reach the well, which makes you immortal
Pass eras through portals, future laughs at tortures
Past asks moms to abort us, re-bear us and reform us
New age of monsters, money-grabbing lobsters
I'm one of them, people killed my morals
Will beat up even corpses, will clear up my causes
I lost any importance, interest, I'm soul-less
I'm flawless bibliog, judged by covers
Useful as a crowbar, hazardous and flamboyant
Done nothing so far, it's just been an omen
Anonymous my torment, don't know what to call that

[Bridge: ]
Only death upon us, killing in my mind
To be killed my fate
Killing's not a crime
Killing's to survive, first law of nature:
You gotta fight for yourself to be your own saviour
Don't care 'bout what you say
No mercy, no limits
DØPe bomaye, hurt soul and feelings
Great like Cassius Clay
The most divine Muhammed
Beat with KO, both Yahweh and Allah

[2nd Verse: ]
I've been a problem cause my mind's been complex
But to be honest that wasn't my problem
Who had to solve it should have rendered the omen
Many less would be sobbing, if they saw me
That morning I was born
To make me drink the conium
Please don't confront me, ISIS a joke, my thoughts would bomb 'em
Jihad in awe cause my rhymes just shocked them
Kill me in cold but know we ain't done yet
Go 'head burn these lyrics, you only make me more het
I'm still a problem, I'm the threat pro tem
I'm Pap going doper, lyricist and suicide bomber
I risk cause I know them, those people I slaughter
Baptised in holy water, but not Christian, under no term
No allegiance to Jesus, neither to Muhammed
Abort their religions, put me on a podium
Come on, come fight me, kill me, you don't stand a chance
Cause I've been dead, which means I've already died once
When I was resurrected
Jesus blood's been infected
And I feel not protected for I say
But I wanna be respected for my preach
Silence is demanded to honor my speech
"Pledge your allegiance to me
Like I'm your God or your king"
Hubris too sweet, to wake me from this dream
Wake me from the dead, I just wanna kill
Tisis, Catharsis, all catholic lies
If it's living let it live
If it's dying, let it die

[Outro: ]
After all, everything that gets born, dies
