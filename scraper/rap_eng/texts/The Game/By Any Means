[Hook]
They say the niggas tryna bury me
I’m just tryna get this cake
With the presidential face
So I don’t let that shit faze me (I ain’t worried)
These pussy niggas don’t worry me
They ain’t gettin’ nothin’ from me
They gon’ have to bring their own
I got all my weapons on me
By any means I’m gon’ get it
Niggas shouldn’t play with life cuz I end it
Niggas tryna play with mine, they gettin’ finished
Either way, I’m gon’ get it

[Verse 1: Uncle Murda]
Kids need new shoes, daddy gotta go and get it
Daddy gotta go and risk his freedom just to go and get it
Daddy just get caught, now the judge won’t free me
Moms can’t raise em on her own, homie, my kids need me
Mess on, gloves on when I handle my business
Landlord don’t wanna hear that I’m tryna get it
The gran do, it’s pants damn back in yo shit
Lose the foof ova my head, I ain’t havin’ that shit
For my sons I aim and my daughter Aaliah
If a nigga don’t respect her, jus I’mma fire (bang)
Then take em jewels off, he ain’t gonna need that (gimme that)
The next time, I would drew it worse, ended up(?)
Them bullets hurt, look at all that blood I made ya spit up
You chockin’ tryna talk, sound like ya got the hiccups
Got this by any means neccesary, even if that mean
Makin’ the mother watch her only son get buried

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Times was the hardest, the product was straight garbage
Walked by niggas, be like I’m glad that he ain’t rob us
When they really should just be glad they ain’t targets
Cuz what I look like tellin’ my kids daddy ain’t got it
C’mon, let’s go, keep rockin’
Bill keep comin’, retros keep droppin’
Whateva’s gonna take, we be here to cop em
Cuz we livin’ in a day and age when no is not an option
We can get it on, I luv the participation
A funeral always shed light on the situation
Yup, heard they wanna bury me, tell em to get in line with the rest
Of the fuck bois that already been tryin’ (yeah)
Think it happen cuz we don’t witness the basket bury
That’s why the otha half of these niggas be extra scary
Shots start poppin’, they know that you’ll catch a parry
I live by the slogan any means necessary
