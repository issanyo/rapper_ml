[Chorus]
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre it's
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you blood
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre is
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you coz

[Verse 1]
Man, look at the wheels the motherfucking wheels
Black Lowenharts bloods, you niggas know the drill
Fuck Lamborghini doors nigga I ride stock
And fuck you new rap niggas, homie I buy' Pac
Dre told' me long time ago joy is pain
You sell 5 million records some shit gonna' change
He was right, I traded the coupe and bought me a Range
No ice to black diamonds in the Aftermath chain
You know I'm gonna ride and ain't shit change
But the right to claim both sides (east side west side!)
Ask Cease', niggas know me down in Bed-Stuy
Blowing sticky with them Crooklyn kids
Hit switches on the Brooklyn bridge
Speakers banging I'm going going, Big took you there
And game recognise Game dont play me homie
You think cuz I'm a millionaire I won't spray you homie

[Chorus]
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre it's
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you blood
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre is
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you coz

[Verse 2]
It's only been 12 months I done' lost a few friends
Had my baby momma bust the windows out of my Benz
Hip-hop police on me every city I'm in
Well hell, me and Dre we dippin' again
3 wheel motion chrome spokes on the rims
Run up on us watch that .38 revolver spin
I'm rich game bitch I made a few mill'
Now the '64 impala got a Paul Wall grill
They say I moved out the hood I ain't keeping it real
So I took the projects back and put it on top of the hill
I'm hungry, still rap like I ain't got no deal
You can pop that cristal but nigga I pop steel
I'm going diamond I put that on my unborn child
I'm almost dead I done' ran 99 miles
Bitches they used to diss me, they feeling me now
They say I rap like the old Snoop, on Doggystyle, haha

[Chorus]
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre it's
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you blood
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre is
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you coz

[Verse 3]
This, could be the day you get rich or
This, could be the day you try
This, could be the day you walk away or
This, could be the day you die
Yeah motherfucker, you hear my shit in the club
When you do know 9 out of 10 times I'm in the club
Stop fucking with Cristal, I can't pay that price
I take a 20 40 ounces and a bucket of ice
Pour it on my niggas, now they flooded with ice
Niggas hate me to my death cause' I'm loving my life
I can walk through any 'hood, I paid that cost
I ain't felt this good since I got shot in the heart
25 years old put the tail on the Porsche
25 covers from Double XL to The Source
Dr. Dre chose me to carry the torch
I spit, cause' the D.O.C lost his voice

[Chorus]
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre it's
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you blood
I won't stop no matter what they say and
I'm still fuckin' with Dr. Dre is
Aftermath so niggas stay the fuck out of my way
I'm tellin' you coz
