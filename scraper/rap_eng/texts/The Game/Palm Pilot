*Young Gunz playing in background*
[Katt]: Aw, pimpin' that's the Young Gunz, I love the Young Gunz
[Game]: Shit, me too nigga
[Katt]: Wait a minute
[Game]: The fuck
[Katt]: Pimpin', what did that nigga just say?
[Game]: I don't know, playa
[Katt]: Play that again
[Game]: Alright

[Young Chris]
So have that money right, and we don't mess with the funny type
Fake ass pimps like Money Mike

[Game]: What the fuck, nigga, punk ass bitch
[Katt]: Let me check my palm pilot, give me that fool, it's a full time pimp mode

[Verse 1 - Katt Williams]
Chris and Neefy, I'm warnin' you sweetie
Y'all can't beat me, you'll see when you meet me
I'ma say it real clear so you niggas understand
Fuck the Young Gunz and both of your fans
Somebody in your camp should've told you to stop it
Now you two rappers gettin' fucked by a comic
I done been to New York, you niggas ain't a factor
How does it feel to get dissed by an actor
And y'all can't really diss a nigga at all
I made one fuckin' movie, I'm more famous than y'all
And it'll take more than some Young Gunz to hurt me
I put your momma on the stroller, bitch ain't but 30
Y'all just got moustaches, how you gon' burn me
Two young gay versions of Bert and Ernie
You don't concern me cause y'all ain't hot
Y'all the only girl group Roc-A-Fella got
Matter fact just don't say my name no more
And try to keep your CD out the 99 cent store

[Hook - Katt Williams]
Cause you can't stop won't stop, two weak mothafuckas
Who just need to sit down 'fore you get the fuck clowned
And if I see you around, I'ma pimp slap you down
And then leave in my Gators without makin' a sound

[Verse 2 - Katt Williams]
Y'all really helped me out, but y'all ain't knowin'
Hey, Chris tell Neefy his thong is showin'
You need to be signin' to Nickelodeon, you the Children's Choice
Next time you say my name put some bass in your voice
Mr. Carter is a pimp that's why he's got the Roc
And got you two young bitches sellin' cock on the block
You can't stop cause you never started
And both of y'all niggas sound plain retarded
Why did y'all get pimpin' started
Two young girls that still get carded
One of y'all sucks and the others garbage
It ain't no secret it's common knowledge
I could've let you slide but I'm too cold-hearted
And I hope you mad enough to realize this
You just got slapped by a fake ass pimp

[Hook]

[Katt]: Shh... I just put the kids to sleep, shh...
[Game]: Time to wake they punk ass up

[Verse 3 - Game]
Can't stop, won't stop, Game sittin' outside
In the stock Range, loadin' a clip while Pac playin'
Since he wanna drop names, I'ma tie him up
Leave him ass naked in the 'hood with his Roc chain
When I pull the death card, your whole crew'll fold
The bullets I throw'll have my Eagles in the Superbowl
You don't want me put the fifth to your chest
Watchin' lil Neefy scramble like "Vic get the tech"
From 40 yards away, oh shit he can catch
Slugs like bikini wax the way they stick to his chest
Yup, I make the savage come out
And ain't no tellin' what the yappin' about before the plastic come out
Blood comin' out the back of your mouth
Unless you take Money Mike' name and put it back in your mouth
Only thing left of you is the ash in your house
You lookin' for a young gun bring Cassidy out
Bitch

[Game]: Yo, Mike kick 'em, man. Still asleep
[Katt]: I-I can't even do it, nigga, I
[Game]: Naw, nigga you gotta kick 'em, man, I'm tellin' you I do this shit all the time, man, we put niggas to sleep, we kick 'em, that wake 'em up, man
[Katt]: I know, but I just wanna see 'em resting there for a second
[Game]: Naw man, go find a mo' fuckin' ouija board or somethin', nigga and we gon', we gon' put the little thing on it, on the C and on the N and we gon' see if Chris and Neef wake they faggot ass up, kick 'em, man
[Katt]: I'm just sayin' out of all the niggas for me to get dissed by it would have to be the two weakest rappers in the history of all rap
[Game]: I'm sayin', nigga, you can kick 'em while I'm right here, nigga, it ain't gon' be nothin', nigga
[Katt]: Okay, I'ma kick 'em one time
[Game]: Kick 'em
[Katt]: This a hard-toe Gator too
[Game]: Come on, kick 'em man, right in the ass
[Katt]: Oh, that felt nice
[Game]: Damn
[Katt]: That nigga got a soft stomach too
[Game]: Look at him, fuckin' faggot
[Katt]: Chris and little Neefy, wait a minute, he just hunched up, he like it, I can't kick 'em no more
[Game]: Yeah, that's funny, niggas goin' into convulsions, pimpin', a pimpin' colvulsion. Nigga a fuckin' faggot, man, I love how you say it, how you say their name again?
[Katt]: Chris and little Neefy
[Game]: Hahahaha
[Katt]: My son loves them, he's seven
[Game]: Aw man, Spongebob and Dora the Explorer, you lil fuckin' faggots
[Katt]: Y'all should be on That's So Raven
[Game]: Let me try to do it, Chris and little Neefy, faggot ass niggas
[Katt]: Go get a pap smear
[Game]: And take off Run DMC outfits nigga, you'll never be them
[Katt]: It's time to set it off, we need to set it off, it's time to set it off, we need to set it off
[Game]: You guys sharin' your lunch tickets
[Katt]: We ain't really had no choice
[Game]: Shit, you ain't even wanna give it to 'em, but you know, it writes them checks, man
[Katt]: He does have bills to pay
[Game]: Nigga gave you a mothafuckin' Drag-On beat from '95, cash that in you faggot, it's fun
[Katt]: bye, bye
[Game]: Chris and little Neefy
