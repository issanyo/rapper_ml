Love made a Vow Made a Vow Knowing to know you Life changed my love to forever be true, Ill take care take care of you, Treat you right through the night Lay beside you, And through the night yeah we just sit and fight Reminisce everything that we had in mind, I feed you and hold you and keep you warm, I hug you and kiss you give you shelter under that storm, when its raining outside no ones out their man but they keep hearing your cry, I don't even know what it was that changed you, I always thought that you would remain true, I used to trust you, led you through a clear path, but you just chose to go your own way, what can I say its a new day Tried leading you Tried Teaching you But AY you just Never learned, I was a little to trustful to let you in Really doesn't concern that the way that I feel all this emotion man got me feeling so real, How do I explain from time to time knowing all this pain You left in my mind, Every second of the day I try to write my rhymes and thinking of way and how I should just start of this time, Its a new chapter man And im doing fine I don't need your criticism or your lame ass lies, I got my family and my friends their by my side and im gonna continue to just speak my mind, Never once did I want us to feel like this, Do you remember that one love song that we grew up listening to when we were kids I seen the inside of you, knowing how we were back then, Now all I can see is a girl lost and full of sin, You were once a angel that filled my world but ever since you turned to that wrong group Girl, I had to leave you and let you take your own path, But never forget that I shared everything with you and told you from the start, You never listened you went the devils way, Did you not see the spirits Gliding around that night when you called me PAUL I need you right now. I didn't feel as if I could help you, because you let these evil spirits enter to posses you, Ive gone through things myself, Turned to the lord and lookin after myself, How can I forgive you, You lied to me and said that you loved me with all your heart. I should have known your deceiving lies why did I take that chance to take you back when im still learning this and growing to be a stronger man, Now you Rant because I don't talk with you nomore, One day you will receive a letter at your door,to know why I left in the first place, You put my life at stake set me up in different ways You played me like a fool, Dam you got a way about it and everybody allways got something to say about it, Its time for you to stop with your petty games and leave me and my family live the Better Days.
