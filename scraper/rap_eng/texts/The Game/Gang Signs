[Hook]
When the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up

[Interlude]
Dear God, I now know what I've done
Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose
Amen

[Verse 1]
Got my mind on this murder, and Problem so gassed up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, played out on that movie screen
Had to scope with some killers, almost died from moving green
My mama a felon, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas, some weed
Leave me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm masked up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers, swear my niggas seen some better days
When California have you stressed out, a million ways to die
Gotta pull that vest out, cause

[Hook]
When the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up

[Verse 2]
Fuck niggas gon' die, speaking homicide
Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rack, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes, killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can you do when you got on the wrong colors?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
Have a problem, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray cause

[Hook]
When the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang signs go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the Westside
When the gang signs go up
