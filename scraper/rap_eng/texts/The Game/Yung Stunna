[Verse 1: Birdman]
Strapped in the traps, money on my mind
Ocean city view, nigga drinkin' red wine
Big deals, got the money on the big feel
Big deal, got the houses in the big hill
All it did was, 250 cash
Brand new McLaren, three on the dash
Hella choppers, switchin' in the fast lane
Nose diving, hunting in the hurricane
Swagged out, you now them red bottoms
In the club with them models and them flower bottles
Rich nigga, blood gang
Uptown, dirty (?), nigga money and fame

[Hook: Birdman]
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Rich nigga blood, rich nigga blood gang
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Yung stunna, yung stunna
Rich nigga blood, rich nigga blood gang

[Verse 2: Game]
Yeah, Soo Woo gang
If you ain't with it, then you in the food chain
The young Hussein, the dragon who blew flames
Burnin' rubber off that lot after coppin' that new Range
YMCMB, WS, nigga, we runnin' through your bitch like a choo-choo train
First do me, then do Wayne
Then do Stunna, then do Mack Maine
Jump in the Bugatti
Tell 'em, bust it like a shawty
Whoa, Kemosabe
Big ballin' is my hobby
Red rag swagga, tell it all over my body
I crashed the Maserati, came back in the Ferrari like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Yeah, yeah, rich nigga blood gang
Four red Phantoms like
Fuck it, it's a Blood thing
Rubies in the watch, blood diamonds in the chain
Nigga, run up on the Game and get your stupid-ass shot
Turn a coupe to a drop, got the groupies on the yacht
Seven years in this bitch, thirty new kids on the block
Rubies in the watch, yeah I had to say it again
I come through and just dookie you on the block
Knock the coofie off the top
When I'm stupid off Ciroc
Hit 'em with the old Hawk, nigga Mookie Blaylock
Fly as Dominique
All my diamond's antique
Who else you know drop fifty songs in a week
Bird call

[Hook]
