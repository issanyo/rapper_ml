[Intro: Harlem Taylor and King Justice] x2
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
Cause my daddy hustle

[Verse 1: Harlem Taylor]
Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm big too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy

[Verse 2: The Game]
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

[Verse 3: The Game]
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

[Verse 4: The Game]
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you
Had this vision for you, and I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me ("Breathe daddy") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One

[Outro: Harlem Taylor (King Justice)]
I'm Harlem, The Game's oldest son
I make straight A's and I'm a good kid
But more importantly, I'm safe
Because my daddy hustled his way out of Compton
So I could have a better life
That's my daddy
And I wish all kids had one like mine
The world would be a better place
One
(Wait Harlem, I wanna say something)
