[Introduction: Sufjan Stevens]
You are the blood flowing through my fingers
All through the soil and up in those trees

[Verse 1: Game]
One-nine seven-nine, that was the year California would go blind
My momma had a son, a fully automatic gun
Eleven pounds, seven ounces, Compton, here we come
My first night in my crib, I hear somebody screaming
A couple gunshots, then some tires screeching
My father reaching, what is he grabbing
He rolled me over in my crib just to get his Magnum
Is he a policeman, that's what I'm thinking
He can't be that because he do heroin and he be drinking
Chopping baby powder up on my momma's mirror
Mexican chicks in my kitchen cooking, looking just like Shakira
I'm in my high chair, they naked, this is rated R
Think I ain't paying attention cause you slide me a Gerber jar
Then my momma walked in with an orange box
I couldn't read what it said cause she leaned over and said

[Hook: Sufjan Stevens]
You are the blood flowing through my fingers
[Game]
And I can feel it in my heart
My mom said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood's flowing
[Sufjan Stevens]
All through the soil and up in those trees

[Verse 2: Game]
First day of kindergarten, shoestrings for a belt
Mom's worked the graveyard, too tired so I dress myself
Who go to school in a Freddy Krueger flannel
Black Chuck Taylors and I never liked sandals
A lot of birthdays but we ain't never light candles
Gang of Christmas gifts but I ain't never seen Santa
So I waited up one year, guess who came to my garage
My daddy with a Toys 'R' Us bag, hit the lights, aha!
Uh-uh, I ain't going for that
I've got presents, I can see 'em 'cause they ain't wrapped
From a race track to a Dre track
Don't wear overalls no more, but a nigga stay strapped
The rumor round my middle school was that I can't rack
It wasn't a locker in that motherfucker that I ain't paint black
And now I'm doing donuts in this Maybach
Reminiscing 'bout detention, teachers used to say that

[Hook: Sufjan Stevens]
You are the blood flowing through my fingers
[Game]
And I can feel it in my heart
My mom said it from the start
That I would always be the reason blood's flowing
[Sufjan Stevens]
All through the soil and up in those trees
