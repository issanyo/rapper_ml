Well, she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?
She's got that street flow, I still wanna hit it slow
She's got that heat on hold, bend the weed I smoke
Know she's a freak show, don't you think she knows?

[Verse 1: The Game]
I tell her, "Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah"
Said she twerkin' for tuition, gon' do that, do that to that 2Pac, 2Pac
Now she don't wanna leave, I'm the one she wanna be wit'
I told her, "Go 'head, do that carousel on the dick"
She say her pussy sweet like caramel, oh, shit
Let me taste that, face where your waist at
Bad boy in the pussy, I'm a bring Ma$e back
Horse and carriage, Diddy, what it take?
That movie on the 6S, know I gotta tape that
Rich nigga shit, ri-rich nigga shit
Stop playin' wit' them lames, be a rich nigga bitch
Tom Ford denim, see the grip when I sit
That boy spit venom, make a nun turn tricks
No teeth, just tongue and some lips wit' the shit
Mustard on the beat, but it's some Ritz in this bitch
