Ca-ca-ca-can't do it like me, can't do it like me

Can't do it like me, can't do it like me
Fuck with Louis, we don't do the Prada

Haa, da-da dat ain't Montana

This industry is scared of me
Fair to say that I'm a g
No, I'm not a follower, I suggest you follow me
No-no green button, they like it, they just be frontin'
Mad at me, when I stunt on the gram
I be fuckin' three bitches, you be chilllin' wit' your man
The world was for the taking and I got it in my hand
I pull up in the Benzo, like I do it for the gram, yeah!
Like I do it for the gram, yeah!
Fuck a bitch and her sister, she gon' do it for the band, yeah!
She gon' do it for the band, yeah!

In the VIP, poppin' bottles, I be standing on the sofa
So many bottles, everybody think they know ya
Hoes lining up, 'cause they all wanna blow ya
And he doin' lines, 'cause they know I got the blow, yep!
Dat Montana, da-da-dat pure coka
I-I-I be getting money, I thought I told ya
If your name rhyme with bitches, you are not a soldier
I been getting money, you are just a loner
We be in the penthouse, balling like the owners

[Verse 2: The Game]

[Verse 3: Derrick Diesel]
I'm-I'm a fuckin' g, Derrick D yeah I told ya
Philly my hometown, come around I can show-ya
Got a couple pounds you can smell the aroma
Weed so lound neighbor screamin turn it down
& I ain't even light it, I'm just breaking up a pound
Yeah you got a couple tats that don't make you G
But when i pull out the strap that'll make you flee
You ain't nothing but a scratch an eight of tree
You gon get your ass smoked tryna play with me
I be chillin on island on the south of France
Bad bitches all around you be chillin on the gram
They like when you gon drop so i pull up in a drop
And I'm not a fuckin lame I dont keep my collar popped
I just pop the hood Louis luggage living good
My goons pop off act blind like Suge
And i got a good lawyer he be lying real good
And I still keep the iron when I'm riding in my hood
Lot of snitches lot of spy's, Like CBS gotta keep an open eye
Jay-Z impressed the shit out of me when i listened to his rhymes
That's when i was baggin reggie, made a killin of the dimes
Had the Gucci and the Louis up in high school living fine
Baggin bitches passing bitches I was always on the grind
Ain't that some shit, Still ain't gettin paid for this rapping shit
So i trap a lot and i rap a bit, but if i get locked i spit half of it
I'm the fuckin man yeah they know me in Philly on my first mixtape had to throw on Gillie, Independent on the track, independent's feeling that
And i probably bag your girl when i finish giver back
