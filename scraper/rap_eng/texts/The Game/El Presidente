[Verse 1: Game]
Death before dishonor, ride with weap' up
Cause niggas tryin' to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I plays for the bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin' of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

[Hook:]
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

[Verse 2: Telly Mac]
Aiyyo, I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Black Sox
Drillin' 'em, killin 'em, if we ain't feelin' 'em nigga
If sticky Fingaz need some music, straight stealin' it nigga
Shinin' in big trucks, big will in it nigga
We climbin' to the top and we sealin' it nigga
So back the f*** up, my niggas act the f*** up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the f*** up
Jacked the f*** up, beat up bad and clapped the f*** up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin' to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin' with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin'
Roll in 600's, Beamers and 'llacs
We a team of cats with the Benz and gats
That fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks but only when the green's attached

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Game + Telly Mac]
It's Telly and young game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Ya or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop
I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth
And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg
So why the f*** you wanna knock us off?
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

[Hook:]
