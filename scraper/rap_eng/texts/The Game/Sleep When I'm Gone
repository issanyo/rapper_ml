[Intro: DJ Khaled]
About to change the game
DJ Khaled
We the best forever
Cash Money, Young Money
I'm for real about this shit
Let's go

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (yeah)
I close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
(Gone)
Looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my track yeah, yeah
(cause time's on my side, so)
Why close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 1: Game]
They say sleep is the cousin of death, guess we related
Cause Iâ€™m the most slept on and the most hated
Hated, hated by niggas with no hustle
Staring at me in the club like I won't bust you
In the face with the spades
Life is a card game and I'm playing Spades
Gambling with your chains
Fucking basketball wives while you at away games
Really fucking basketball wives; ain't gotta say names
Whole body tatted like a New York City freight train
Niggas get to barking, put a bullet in the Great Dane
Try me, end up like Rodney
Team full of animals, like I coach the Heat
Four floor mansion, close to the beach
Six car garage, that's how I'm supposed to eat
In Miami, rolling up kush on boat decks
Flagging down the waitress, waving my Rolex

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (yeah)
I close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
(Gone)
Looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my track yeah, yeah
(cause time's on my side, so)
Why close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, I don't survive the test of time doing this shit so long
And only rest to rise again homie
I sleep when I'm gone
A legend while I'm prime
So current and they hate this
The streets classified me as another level of greatness
I don't fight for crowds at all I let wack niggas bitch
And let them flip while they debate on who the king of this shit
Listen, I don't waste time debating them things
Cause I'm God motherfucker, God create kings
I'm hearing that a lot of niggas mad through the grape vine
Piano sounding beautiful and sad at the same time
The feeling of a funeral so study you niggas
Khaled, provide the theme music while I bury you niggas
Now there's no escaping the God you better find a getaway
'Fore I start wiling like Haitians and Jamaicans when it's Labor Day
Khaled, every time you know we gotta make em love it
Realize that everything is hotter when we touch it

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (yeah)
I close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
(Gone)
Looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my track yeah, yeah
(cause time's on my side, so)
Why close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone

[Verse 3: The Game]
Ayo, Khaled let this shit breathe
Spoil little rich nigga, that's me
Smoke blowing out the sunroof, blowing on hashish
Can't stop now cause I'm in too deep
One point five wired every two weeks
Niggas wanna kill me, let the shells fall out
Life insurance and plates
My kids gon' ball out
They kids gon' ball out
Twenty years from now pulling cars out
You gon' think cocaine getting hauled out
X getting shipped in
Crystal Meth getting dipped in
All cause you let a nigga slip in
Aftermath, 05, G-Unit, 06
Everything else is gymnastics, watch the dough flip
Sitting on the couch, smoking up memories
Pouring Jack Daniels, toast to my enemies
Fuck beef, nigga I ain't got the energy
Take the last shot to the dome, John Kennedy

[Hook: Cee-Lo Green & Ester Dean]
I'm counting my time cause my time is my money (yeah)
The sun goes down but I won't stop for nothing (yeah)
I close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
(Gone)
Looking at the clock like yeah, yeah
Naps to my track yeah, yeah
(cause time's on my side, so)
Why close my eyes
I'd rather sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
Sleep when I'm gone
