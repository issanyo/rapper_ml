Intro [talking]:
Damn it's 1am already huh
Shit EP, you ain't lost a motherfucking beat since that Doctor's Advocate intro
This shit sound crazy, piano keys, 808 drums
Oh shit what the fuck was that? Ray charles on some gangsta shit

Hook [The Game]:
I'm a maniac niggas tryna steal my shine, I gotta warn you not to cross that line, cause I'm a motherfucking maniac
Nigga, it's about that time to introduce em to that new tech nine
My momma told me I'm a maniac
Don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga
I'm motherfucking maniac
So don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga

Verse 1 [The Game]:
I'm fucking insane, Glock 45, put it to my own brain
Blow the shit out, come back, that's why they call me Game Yeah, I'm loco got you rap niggas in a choke hold
Jermaine Dupri ass niggas always rappin so-so
Always on my dick, jocking my car, jocking my bitch
Westside, I'm on that gangsta shit
After Snoop there will be no more except for me
I snuck in Dr. Dre's kitchen and stole the recipe
Cook crack on these dope ass beats, I got heat
Like Pacino, lyrical assain, there will be no
More beefing with these corny ass rap niggas
Kill a nigga on your song never bust a gat, nigga
Yelling out ceelo never shot a crack, nigga
Heard one Jeezy verse now you a trap nigga?
2 classic albums, 8 times plat, nigga
Hip hop's new blood, check the stats, nigga

Hook [The Game]:
I'm a maniac niggas tryna steal my shine, I gotta warn you not to cross that line, cause I'm a motherfucking maniac
Nigga, it's about that time to introduce em to that new tech nine
My momma told me I'm a maniac
Don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga
I'm motherfucking maniac
So don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga

Verse 2: [The Game]
I only been gone 5 months, now Ray J fucking Whitney and Bobby
With Superhead, call Nas tell him hip hop is super dead
I had to fall back, try to desolve rap
Mix a classic with backin soda what you call that?
Niggas cut my legs off and watch me crawl back
Hip hop king with a LA Dodgers ball cap
Who can fuck with me, go buck for buck with me?
Listening to my rhymes waitin on me to say fuck fif..
It ain't gon happen nigga
Hip hop done went soft, a millon dollars every time I slap a nigga
You niggas know to take it from a OG
No more fuck you, back to sayin fuck the police
I stay on that motherfucking Straight Outta Compton
NWA shit, hip hop need a facelift
Face it, take em' back to the basics
Especially since I rode in on Dr. Dre's hits

Hook [The Game]:
I'm a maniac niggas tryna steal my shine, I gotta warn you not to cross that line, cause I'm a motherfucking maniac
Nigga, it's about that time to introduce em to that new tech nine
My momma told me I'm a maniac
Don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga
I'm motherfucking maniac
So don't trust me nigga, cause I don't trust me nigga

Outro:
Shit man, I'm dope as a muthafucker
I'm so dope niggas should put my skinny ass in one of those fucking bottles and put a red top on it and sell me
Name yo price, fuck it, I'm crack
