[Intro: Compton Menace]
East side M.E.N.A.C.E
Now look
There's two types of bitches
You got a bitch and a bitch ass nigga
Sometimes a bitch is more harder than them bitch ass niggas

[Hook: Compton Menace]
Fire it up if that bitch blow
If you about the bread let that bitch know
And my shit bang know that bitch cold
Compton, California still cracking like it's 94'
If you east side let that bitch know
If you west side let that bitch know
If you north side let that bitch know
If you south side let that bitch know

[Verse 1: Compton Menace]
If you a real nigga let that bitch know
All around the hood with gold D's on the 64'
Money good
Niggas blowing trees put that on the hood
Look at me
All about the cream
But it's to the good
Nose to the back
Still grip the wood
Gotta keep that pistol on my lap
Gripping like I should
When I'm splitting them spliterillos
Tipping aficionados
Buying up all the bottles
Fuckin on all them models
Dishing up all them hollows
….........
….........
People rocking like I know
Like fuck it I'm in the finals
I'm fucking round with my idols
You know that they bitches idle
And I'm the same nigga till the end
Till my enemies want to be friends
I gotta get the paper till the end
And put the hood on with my pen
(It's the Menace)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
Nigga like me
Born and raised on soo woo street
It's going down like two ruphies
I'm in that new coupe sweet
Like how a new fruit be
A nigga hard as two fruit Bs
Niggas salute me
B-L-Double-O-D
I'm a OG
Thirty two
One year younger than Kobe
Know he
Up in that Phantom
With a bitch from Atlanta
Get head
Wiping his head with his red bandana
Uhh
It's getting hot in this bitch
Take your shirt off
Step on the gas
Let off the mag
And then merk off
I'm a shooter
Nigga get his Dirk off
Bet this desert eagle knock your muthafuckin smirk off
Sipping on Smirnoff
The liquor store out of ciroc
Get a shipment in by next Tuesday
Or get your mark ass shot
My block hot
Nigga word to Pac
It's Cedar Block 554
