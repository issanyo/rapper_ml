[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm tryna pick a weekend
Hit your crib, sneak in
Take you out your lil pearl and listen to the Weeknd
All night, damn right, hotel and flight
Part of my french but I'm just tryna get you tanned right
She mulatto, what I need with top models
When I got you and the water clearer then Ciroc bottles
In that Louis V tote, got to keep at least 40
Least to say you competing with girls on the east coast
But you killing them in LA and that's a fact
Never had a m√©nage but she beez in the trap
I'm behind you like a 35, oh you ran back
Money gang its a rap
Yeah...Yeah

[Hook: Chantel]
If I could, mail my heart
Right to you I would
I would pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it over night
Everytime I hear your voice and I look into your eyes
Sends a burning sweet sensation oh
Inside of me

[Hook 2]
The look in your eyes, has found me
And I am sending

[Chorus: Chantel]
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

[Verse 2: Chantel]
With my heart, in your hand
I'm as helpless as a baby
I'm in desperate need of your love
So just send it right away
I've been thinking about you boy
Because you're so far away
Makes me want to send you all this love inside of me

[Hook 2: Chantel]
The look in your eyes, has found me
And I am sending...

[Chorus]
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

[Hook: Chantel]
If I could, mail my heart right to you I would
I would pack it up, seal it tight and I'd send it over night

[Chorus
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
Sending my love to you
(If I could mail my heart right to you I would)
