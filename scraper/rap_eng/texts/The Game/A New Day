[Hook]
It's a new day my turn to ball
The streets is mine gotta hold it down at all cost
Gotta hustle till the sun go down
And I'm livin' for tomorrow just me and my 4-pound
Get money is all we know
Success breeds envy, then I love the dough
It's a new day my turn to shine
I'm startin' a new chapter on enemy lines

[Verse 1]
As a youth I was the truth
On sunday, without a suit
Gunplay, come out the roof
Drivebys and shootin' hoops
All I had in this cold world, was old girl
Need I explain the definition of a duece-duece
I was fathered by the OG's and coke heads
The days of suede pumas, tube-socks, and pro-keds
In California trap
This is a ballad of a soulja a new era before they stitched into fitted caps
You gotta feel em' black
These are the given facts
Vote the Doc' as President, Bush wanna diminish rap
What about the sports and entertainment
Never mind we more focused on Michael Jacksons arraignment
And everybody wanna be famous
Soon enough, The youth will be looking up to a million Lebron James's
Open your eyes or forever be lost
Somewhere in between west Los Angeles and east New York

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
We gotta get up out this mothafucka'
Wether we riddle, lacrosse, or dribble out this mothafucka'
Get my mind right, it's something I had to do
They tryna run me off the road on basketball avenue
I been through it all, thats why I pursue to ball
I was taught put it on the line win, lose, or draw
I been patiently waiting'
Fore' the day to meet satan
So he can see my Jordans planted on the pavement
Jesus Walks, to who made that immaculate statement
Deserves triumph for reaching out to black, mexican, white, and asian
He destined for greatness
Your body is a temple, temple is sacred
Once the words of a newborn Pastor Mason
What's the world coming to? How will it ever end
When men killin men over women in 600 benzes
Pray for the haters near me
Until I'm laid and buried
These are hoop dreams and the court is my sanctuary
