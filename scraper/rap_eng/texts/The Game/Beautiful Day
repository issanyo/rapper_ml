I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day (West side)
I'm in love it's a beautiful day (We the future)
I'm in love it's a beautiful way (We the future)
I don't care what the weathermen say (We the future)
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 1]
I'm free as a mother fucking bird I swear
Disapparently in air
There go game nigga where
Hosted on the block
In the black ass
In that all black phantom hug a block like a bear
Yeah That V12 is roaring
Flying through the city with the pedal to the floor and
I'm putting 26 inches on the curve
Tell the hood I'm back
Give me the Quarter and let me serve
Swab, I'm still dope that's my word
All I did was wished the kitches and some track all on a bird
Eerb, Goddy u know I'm a murderer
Half these niggas beefing with me
I never heard of them
If I was the old me I would murdered them
In matter of face if I was the old me I would hurt him still
Courtesy, um a sleep-in west in
I kill trash like AIDS nigga get affect

[Hook]
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2]
The dream of Hougie Newton that's what I'm living through
The dream of Eric White that's what I'm giving you
Who walked through the White House without a buisness suit
Compton hand Jerry Curl tripping around a waiting shoes
Gave Mike all my demo came here to pay my deuce
Started off with who can
Then I start blazing blue
It was all a dream like Big said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon define the rules of gravity
Studied off classic start revising my strategy
Cause Marshal Matthers made it
Curtis Jackson made the hell
And the clouds wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gabe went
How do I say this I'm living for my son
But I can't figure out why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece like a Catholic nun
To war to be a rap legend has just begun (begun)

[Hook]
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful day
I'm in love it's a beautiful way
I don't care what the weathermen say
It's a beautiful day
