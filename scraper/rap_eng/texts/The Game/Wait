[Intro]
Zone Four, yeah, let's go

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
I'll be swimming in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whipping the whips that you never seen of
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addicted to me now
And all the fast girls wanna get money
Baby girl, you ain't getting nothing from me, all you get is this dick
Make it bounce like a bunny
Kicks are for kids but you feel it in your ribs like
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker, wait, wait, wait

Verse 1: [Chris Brown]
Girl I wanna make you sing like opera
Gotta cold, hit a dose, I'm your doctor
Pink house like a copper, man I cop the chopper
Lion King in that thing, Mufasa
I'mma break you off just a bigger bit of me
You might wanna take a bite right out of me
Girl I think you ready, oh damn
You want me to do something, yes ma'am

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I just wanna get a little, give a little, take a little
Make a little love all over my place
Baby girl, you got a bottom, I can spot from a mile
And I be wilding out then I'll pass you off to Trey
Girl I'm right in front of you, wanna be right up under you
Kissing under your belly button for about a month or two
You gon' love it when I look in your eyes
I'm hitting high now

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
I'll be swimming in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whipping the whips that you never seen of
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addicted to me now
And all the fast girls wanna get money
Baby girl, you ain't getting nothing from me, all you get is this dick
Make it bounce like a bunny
Kicks are for kids but you feel it in your ribs like
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Girl I like you face down with your ass up
Do the most, get ghost like Casper
Beat it like a boxer, eat it like a lobster
Tell me your desires, get you higher than a rasta
I got something special for you when I get you home
You should let me drive girl, the ride's really long
If you wanna ride, ride, ride, you can
You just gotta lie, lie to your man

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
I just wanna get a little, give a little, take a little
Make a little love all our my crib
Girl if you can take a lot, make a lot of sounds
I'ma take your body down and I'll pass you on to Chris
Girl I'm right in front of you, tell me what you wanna do
I just want your body with my body right up under you
You turning me on like a Keri Hilson song
And I wanna get you going right now, let me knock you down

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker, wait, wait, wait

[Verse 3: Game]
I’m in that Murcielago, riding through Chicago
And it’s twelve o'clock, twelve o'clock on my Movado
Yeah I know, me and CB, it's like back to back diablos
Drop the top, put on your goggles
Swim with the young Mike Phelps under my Gucci belt
I said swim, not unstrap my Gucci belt
More choppers than Johnny Depp in that Moss
So many Game imposters riding ram in the boxsters, I'm in the Deville
Sipping on Belvedere vodka, so many tricks
Hit 'em in a little bit, can't rap my shit
I ain't no chicken, never been no tricky ish
If I buy a bottle, she a model when she lickin' it
If I'm going down, I'm eating it like quick and split
Knocking on my dressing room, kust to get flick with Chris
She spilling my Crys', freaking on my fresh fit
Curve, that's when I get on to the next chick

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
I'll be swimming in women and I'll be diggin' in linen
And I'll be whipping the whips that you never seen of
Well the quip is just whip it and make it purr like a kitten
And I'ma have you addicted to me now
And all the fast girls wanna get money
Baby girl, you ain't getting nothing from me, all you get is this dick
Make it bounce like a bunny
Kicks are for kids but you feel it in your ribs like
Wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute, motherfucker, wait, wait, wait
