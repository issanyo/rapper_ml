[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Produce by Drumma, featuring The Game
Drumsquad DJ's in the bulidin' with me, I'm rockin' with you
1017 Drumsqaud DJ, you know how we rockin'

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
They say kush is my cologne
I say, "Is it me"? I'm easier to smell
Than I am to see
Them Rolex on my wrist cost 'bout ten bricks at least
I stole your bitch right under you, cause I'mma beast
Diamond's on my knuckles, Gucci on my buckle
If you want some trouble we can do the fuckin' Royal Rumble
I'm on now, it's in killa
You wanna win, bet a real with a real nigga
I'm trapped out, she coked out
Fifty bags of gas, room smoked out
I double back, then change routes
Call back he need a 9 and a half a pound
It's Gucci

[Hook: Gucci Mane] (x2)
Everybody wasted, like it's payday
The whole world faded, like it's payday
Bottles poppin' crazy, like it's your birthday
We smokin' chronic crazy, like Dr. Dre day

[Verse 2: Game]
Nigga I'm a motherfuckin' killa
Used to run with a pack of motherfuckin' gorillas
I'm about my scrilla, I'm about my gang
S double O - W - double O nigga we insane
Talkin' to me bout Gucci, nigga lost his fuckin' brain
Automatic, we tune his ass up like T-Pain
Nigga we ain't entertainers, we nothin' like Rambo
Pull up in them Lambos, and hop out with them bangers
Nigga I be makin' bangers, my plaques they be platinum
My rims they be platinum, so them bitches know what's happinin'
When Gucci get to rappin' all them haters be quiet
Flocka start shakin' his dreads niggas start a riot
Black wall Bricksquad, Chrome four fifth squad
Phantom got diarrhea I can't stop shittin' on 'em
Sittin' on them sixers, like Doc in his hayday
Rollin' up them swishers, cause nigga it's, nigga it's payday

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Stoned, they wasted
They can't feel they face, gotta take it
It's so hard to shake how I bake it
Cook cakes like the chef in the bakery
I'm just tryin' to make it through makin'
I got a sweet jug in actin'
I got a coke connect he a Haitian
I had a weedman, but he a has been
I gotta smoke the gas 'til the ass end
They wanna jack me, but that's a dead end
This AR-15 will make your headspin (two times)
I'll even drop the top like Janet Jackson (two crimes)

[Hook]
