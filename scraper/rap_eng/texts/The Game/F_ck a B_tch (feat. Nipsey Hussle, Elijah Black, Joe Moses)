Fuck a bitch(X12)

[Verse 1: Game & Elijah Blake]
Naw I ain't on sucka shit
Pull up to ya mama house yellin' out (Fuck a bitch)
Who you think you fuckin with
All these hoes with me but you can have em
I don't cuff a bitch, pull up in some other shit
Not that shit my other shit
This my bread and butter
Peanut butter guts in the whip
Project dirty got the pyrex burning
Totin' iron moving birdies
I'm a rich ass burglar
Don't get yo bitch ass murdered
I'm from compton hub city
Got my thugs with me got my bloods with me
Maserati do a buck fitty

[Pre-Hook: Elijah Blake]

And these pretty bad broads be all on my dick

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hu$$le]
Look, fuck a bitch, never on no sucka shit
Always on some money motivated nipsey hu$$le shit
Pass on her, go fast on her
Pull out [?] coupes and count cash on her
Hoggy with me if i point he gon' blast on em
Drop racks on a case that's a gag order
Tough talk turn to sad stories
Fuck a bitch if he die that's too bad for it
Fuck a bitch I'm too fly I'm a asshole
I'm a bougie ass nigga with these fast hoes
I got stripes and stamps on my passport
You got life fucked up so yo ass broke

Bitch 'fore you hit my bottle who is you with?

[Pre-Hook: Elijah Blake]

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
Fuck a basketball wife and bet i didn't say nothin'
Put a k up on a nigga bet he won't bang nothin'
For the roley for the homie blood sweater we pimpin'
Red bottoms cost a church ye i swear that I'm Christian
I'ma [?] on the bitch, rain hail snow
And if i ever love a bitch I'm like hell no
Well maybe at the supper [?] we like TU
We had to nickname this model bitch PU
I'm the man in the city, AP's and gold bottles
Nine out of ten she suck it she gon' swallow
Nine out of ten she lookin for ball players
I'ma pimp or buy mine Giuseppe's don't do gators
Weave to your knees believing you too on
Fuckin' for a sip in the club you too wrong
Game called the nigga I'm like what's the deal
He like fuck a bitch nigga, I'm like ye it's trill

[Pre-Hook: Elijah Blake]
