I've got my work cut out 'cause these fifteen minutes won't squash the doubt
You're stuck inside my head. There's a loop repeating all you said
Why should I care what anybody thinks? I've done all I can there's nothing left to see here
So we'll throw expectations aside and then start it all over
Someone hit the reset. I don't care what he said, no
Nothing ever mattered before. I could always ignore all the things I don't wanna know
Someone hit the reset. I don't care what she said, no
I can say whatever I feel just as long as it's real. No rewards for crying out loud
I wrecked myself today. I fall to pieces as I turn the page
Like I'm beside myself pointing fingers at this empty shell
