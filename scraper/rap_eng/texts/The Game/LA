[Hook: will.i.am]
I'm cooling in LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA

[Verse 1: The Game]
Pull up to the Rosco's
Only guy here, cause niggas from here
Know you gotta swerve around the potholes
Eating chickens with these chickens, politicin'
We gon' get a new team or not?
They up and down like Impala switches
All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody tripping, we mix Cîroc with Patrón here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smoking on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga
Welcome to the circle maine
Catch me off of Rodeo, Alameda, Figueroa
Whoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row
And I ain't dissing homeless people, I be down there feeding niggas
100 days, 100 nights, we killing for no reason nigga
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Impala

[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & The Game]
I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with Daynas on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
You're either skinny jeans, Gucci belt or straight saggin'
Pleasure and agony, black James Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car

[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
I got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'
No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorean rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down the 10, East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, que pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it in LA
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuckin' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga tu madre
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car

[Hook 2: will.i.am & Fergie]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in-
(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)

[Verse 4: The Game]
It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been fiending for this shit, Aftermath a crackhouse
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the Mac out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's
I hate waitin'
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'mma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this llama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember Bump J, out west? I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight Outta Compton, I'm the fucken movie poster to it, nigga
(Compton)

[Outro: The Game]
Mitchy, we out Blood
