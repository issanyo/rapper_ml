[Verse]
I was workin' the pot
Little nigga, I was signed to the rock not Hov and Big
The road was big, my role was big
Momma banging on my door, bitch that stole my gig
Used to cook it, Chef Boyardee
Chop and roll up tree, enough weight to fit new RV
Never imagined my path would be the music
Had a Basketball in the nine, 'cause nigga I can shoot it, check it
The bloods recruiting, USC recruiting
All the while, I'm in the streets recouping
Got barbecue, washing my Coupe
Fiends all on my Coupe
Banging Biggie bitch "Gimme The Loot"
Repping the letter b, they said I would never be
The king of anything but the methamphetamines
They was praying for my downfall, praying that my heart stop
Way back before The Documentary dropped
