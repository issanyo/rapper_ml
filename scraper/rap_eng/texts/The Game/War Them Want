Come on, I'm saying peace to the guards
I'm steady peeping you're cards
Don't even speak to these broads
Pussy deeper than yours
Ya'll rockin' pieces with flaws
Trying to get back on your jobs
Trying to cut back on your costs
Suck a dick, bitch
None o'you fuckin' with Rah Digga
AKA D.I., AKA Dirty Girl
We stay reppin' ##unknown##
Some even call me G5, (Why?)
Shorty, you're back, to the highest power
##unknown##
What's up? You say the proof in the pudding?
I say the proof in the pie
Cats be on me all day, like you the truth, ma
See you on Rap City, you killed the booth, ma
##unknown##, been in this shit since Woo ha
Too fly, truck full o' dames
Acting stuck up in the rain
We jangling, baby, more than those bums with cup full of change
Couple bust on some brains, from Beverly Hills to Compton
Fucking with Game? True story, man

Nigga, I spit that true shit, that me and you shit
Like I was at bay sly when Jay recorded Blue Print
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes, he told Dre, dude's sick
Dre showed me the dotted line, I been in the booth since
Niggas came and went, I watched behind the Range Rover tints
Now I'm here, put a chain on the fence
Or Phantom in the driveway, paint on the bricks
Walk this way, get more than Jam Jay on the kicks
I got stripes like ##unknown## dodge
You wanna buy these ##unknown##, meet me at Eno, at Mardi Gras
I be in the Cranberry, my ##unknown## high
I'm that nigga, plus Digga, flip mode and I
We getting rock money before I heard Dre
Kingpin, nigga, ten ki's for my twentieth birthday
Yeah, five bricks, a bentley coup
A range of five or six in the black H2, G-unit

[The Game]
They say a coward dies a thousand deaths, but they don't say when
So these niggas snitching, trying to stay away from the state pen
I never did more than a week, but I seen ##unknown## to walk through a penitentiary
If you ain't doing twenty five to life without the possibility
It's possible, that you possibly not feeling me
My anger is stemming from all this negativity
And that's the type of shit that bring out the eminem in me

[Rah Digga]
Well, we getting twisted as hell, you know I'm sick when I spell
Hip-hop in my blood, might have sickle sell
Get with with the drill, you know mommy getting the scrill
They almost used me in the sequel 'cause of how I kill bills
They be like, yo shorty, why you move that way?
Shoot that tray, turn niggas into goose pate
Always keep a little stash for any fool that lay
Or straight beat down, face looking blue, black, grey
