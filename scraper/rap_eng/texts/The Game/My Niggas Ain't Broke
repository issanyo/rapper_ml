[Hook]
My niggas ain't broke
My niggas ain't broke
Addicted to this money, every day I overdose
Bout to go from coast to coast
You know my niggas ain't broke
Hard as gold, go roll for roll
You know my niggas ain't broke
My niggas ain't broke
My niggas ain't broke
You know my niggas ain't broke
My niggas ain't broke
You know my niggas ain't broke

[Verse 1: Gillie Da Kid]
My nigga's ain't broke, get money over here
Trap 40 on the watch, see the rocks up in my Audemar
Ya'll nigga's just broke
Know this shit, not fear
Nigga's can't pay the rent, always been gettin' high
[?]
Don't worry about me, fuck around with ya hard body
All my nigga's voodoo, move coke, crack on the stove, and a little molly
Now, which one of you nigga's, wanna try and rob me?
Now, which one of you nigga's wanna R.I.P.?
Hmm, I don't think so
My family matters, that's Winslow
[?]
Dead presidents, I came for
I fiend for, I'm addicted
If gettin' money was a felony then all my nigga's convicted
Philly nigga, I'm vicious
Box of money, Joe Frazier
I don't even wanna talk to ya'll if you ain't talkin' no paper
Face mob and these fake guys, I don't fuck with these haters
Shades on [?], my bitch bag is Marc Jacob


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Game]
I got a whole lot of money, all I do is try to spend it
Brand new Maserati, I ain't buy it just to tint it
See me when I'm in it, 2Pac me if you got me
I'm bout to buy a bird, can't no motherfucker stop me
Throwin' racks in the club, nigga grew up a bastard
Spend it while I'm here, can't stuff it inside my casket
Know how to cook that China, and wrap it up in that plastic
Task force hit the block, let us sit in that [?]
Trap lord nigga, I ain't make it off no rappin'
If he ain't sellin' dope, how the fuck is he in that Aston
Nigga stop asking, I don't like questions
I don't like my dope cut, that's why I fuck with Mexicans
Can't be a broke nigga, at the crib stressing
Baby momma in the window, can't afford to dress her
It's enough money for everybody
But, this dope shit nigga ain't for everybody
