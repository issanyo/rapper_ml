[Hook]
I keep three heats on me
.45, Glock and a gauge
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade
Any nigga try to stunt get sprayed
What happened to the body? Nigga, MIA!

[Verse 1]
Swear a nigga stuntin', but I do this everyday
Had them hoes bouncin' on my dick like a Chevrolet
Put on for my city, nigga city on my face
And I'm 'bout to throw a party, tell Diddy send a case
Fuck a square nigga, I'll say it to his face
Rap niggas quick to tell like it's a snitch nigga race
My nigga Frank told me, "take your time bakin' cakes"
Gotta get to the money at a Indiana pace
Nigga said he gob' rob me, bitch you could miss me
Stay strapped up like I'm 5150
Mo' K's than the mothafuckin' pitcher
Get your ass smoked like a Swisher

[Hook]
I keep three heats on me
.45, Glock and a gauge
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade
Any nigga try to stunt get sprayed
What happened to the body? Nigga, MIA!

[Verse 2]
In the mirror, "where you headed nigga?" To the fuckin' gun range
Fuck the paper, nigga shoot the whole fuckin' gun range
Yellin' at the cop car "soo-woo", here I come Wayne
Bail only a hundred thousand, nigga that's chump change
Back on deuces, front's on dubs
Bet a Bentley and a Phantom that this bitch don't run
When you worth twenty mill, you can shine when it's sunny
Just turned thirty, so I can't be from Young Money
There's Young Money and there's young money
Niggas from the crew then there's nigga with young money
Hatin' on a real nigga cause he on and you not
Cut your head, got some tats, now he think he 2Pac
Nigga pull up at the club tryin' to floss
Boy done grew a beard now he think he Rick Ross
Say he sellin' birds can't tell you what it costs
How the fuck you gon' get a chicken off

[Hook]
I keep three heats on me
.45, Glock and a gauge
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade
Any nigga try to stunt get sprayed
What happened to the body? Nigga, MIA!

[Verse 3]
Nigga sold ten million now they say I'm Hollywood
If I sold ten more, shit I probably would
I done drove every car, I done sold every drug
Fucked all the hoes, popped every bottle in the club
Hoes tryin' to give me pills, bitch I ain't into drugs
Coconut Ciroc by the case, give me groupie love
Grammy nominated, ain't forgot about the stove
Paint the Phantom all red, call that bitch Derrick Rose
In and out of lanes, 24's insane
To think I got this far from sellin' cocaine
I'm a stand up nigga, get your grands up nigga
Take your ass to Staples, get your rubber bands up nigga
Made all this fuckin' money what the fuck I'm gon' cop now
I don't know but I'm comin' through with the top down
Too much to live for my sons and my daughter
One more and I'ma take 'em to the Carter

[Hook]
I keep three heats on me
.45, Glock and a gauge
LeBron James, Chris Bosh and D. Wade
Any nigga try to stunt get sprayed
What happened to the body? Nigga, MIA!
