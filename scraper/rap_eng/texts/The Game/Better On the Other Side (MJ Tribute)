The Game ft. Chris Brown, Boyz II Men, P. Diddy, Usher Mario Winans & Polow Da Don
Better On The Other Side (Michael Jackson Tribute)

[P. Diddy - Talking / Mario Winans - Background Vocals]

I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk
I believed I could do anything
You made the world dance
You made the music come to life

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start
Never gon let you go, it's from my heart (The King, woah! - Polow da Don)

[The Game]

Who's Michael Jackson
You're Michael Jackson
I'm Michael Jackson
We all Michael Jackson
I guess what I'm asking is everybody bow their head for a legend don't breathe for a second
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about
So you can hear my message, my confession
Someone tell Usher, I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young thriller touched him, like he touched me, like he touched you
So carry on his legacy, something I must do and I trust you lighting candles, concrete visuals, me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room
First thing I did when I heard was call Puff
Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us
Who is us? Me and 50, that beef is dead, him and young Mike Jackson gone take us to the ledge

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start
Never gon let you go, it's from my heart

[The Game]

As I'm pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker
When list my air ones, MJ was my nigga
Not the one that play ball, the one with the hollywood star
And since I'm a hollywood star I'm gonna tell you my story
Never had a family that close, never see Barry Gordy walking through interscope
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope
No matter what you say
I'm gonna love him and he's still dope
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone, dancing for my momma thriller jacket with all the zippers on
Now I'm doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston
Listening to Outkast, I'm sorry Mrs Jackson
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we won't Corretta you
I'm writing this letter to all the Jackson kids, we all Jackson kids, time to let us through

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start
Never gon let you go, it's from my heart

[Chorus with Usher & Mario Winans - Background Vocals]
[P. Diddy - Talking / Mario Winans Vocals]

People can say what they wanna say about you
But we gon' remember the miracles that you showed us
Through your music, through your dance, through your philanthropy
You were the one that made us all realize
That we are the world
You are the one that showed us we can moonwalk
You gave us the beat, you gave us the rythm
You gave us the soul
Through us your legacy lives on
We can't stop now, we won't stop now
Mike Jackson

[Chris Brown - Chorus]
This the type of song that make the angels cry
I look up in the sky and I wonder why?
Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side
You were chosen from the start
Never gon let you go, it's from my heart

[Boys II Men - Outro]
This the kind of song to make the angels cry
Look up in the sky, ask God why
Why, why, do we live and let die

[Boys II Men - Outro]
This the kind of song to make the angels cry
Look up in the sky, ask God why
Why, why, do we live and let it die
