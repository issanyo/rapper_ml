(Intro: Game)
Dre and Vidal
Niggas play everything live, nigga
Like Kool & the Gang back in the day
Nigga play it live, nigga
Fuck you niggas know about making beats?
You don't know shit
Pussies (Ha ha)
Fuck you ever seen a nigga in his 20's with a guitar, bitch?

(Verse 1: Game)
Mother's only son, so I
Had to knock a nigga the fuck out on the block if he
Made my sisters cry
I was O-Dog in Larenz Tate's dreams
Red everything niggas know what I mean
Red rag top and I made the dash pop
Before niggas came with stash spots, man
I was a dope man, dope man
I tried to tell em' I could never be a felon
I was too good at sellin' crack, X, speed and heroin
Fiends call me Monroe, cause I used to kill em' down in Marilyn
Puttin' niggas underground give me a shovel
He still alive fuck him, I was on that level
Back then I ain't believe in God
If they heal like they say on TV, why bullets leave a scar?
Revenge is a feelin, but on my son's life
When I catch the two niggas that shot me I'mma, kill em'

(Hook: Anthony Hamilton)
Desperate moments I've been waiting all my life (All my life)
No mistakes I promise this will be my time (My time)
I know hustlin' leads us to an early grave
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?

(Verse 2: Game)
I watched the coke price double up
I was too young to be a cook, so I had to sit back and watch it bubble up
Sittin' in the window seein' gang bangers knuckle up
Watchin' the wind blow girls' skirts while they double dutch
I had straight D's I wasn't in much trouble much
Either you do my homework for me or I'mma fuck you up
Moms lied for me told her friends I was a nice student
Would a' had all A's if algebra was Ice Cube
There it is, I studied a veteran
Hoping that one day I could be a fucking hip hop legend
I listened to Nas, Big, Dre, Snoop
And even though Pac hated him, I bumped Jay too
Bought Reasonable Doubt and let it play straight through
Used to throw my head back, like Kanye do
Niggas never thought that I would break through
Irv Gotti, and P Diddy passed but Jimmy and Dre knew

(Hook: Anthony Hamilton)
Desperate moments I've been waiting all my life
No mistakes I promise this will be my time
I know hustlin' leads us to an early grave
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?

(Bridge: Game and Anthony Hamilton)
A.H take em' to church
Our father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy
Name
Thy kingdom come thy founding father
Protect the Game (Yes sir)
Please show the way (Yes)
Open up the gate
(Yes)
Free us from pain (Yes sir)
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?

(Verse 3: Game)
I'm talking to my niggas, All Stars and Timberlands
(North face is a pin and it's a million thugs marching)
For the dearly departed I elevated my knowledge
They say that I was name droppin', I was just paying homage
For Lil' E and Tiana, I'm sayin' that dear mama help me read between the lines pass periods and
Commas
The million dollar baby young homie tryna' prosper
Act like you don't see me, you might win a Oscar
Act like you don't see me, I might just pop ya
Niggas singing like Sinatra I box like Bernard Hopkins
Left jab like Oscar, I'm the golden boy
You niggas seen what happened to Roy
Yeah, you niggas seen what happened to
Roy
On my block niggas box we the knockout boys
Sitting in the throne with the doja sparkin', it's my seat and I ain't moving like Rosa Parks
Ima be here

(Hook: Anthony Hamilton)
Desperate moments I've been waiting all my life
No mistakes I promise this will be my time
I know hustlin' leads us to an early grave
But it's the only way, how come niggas dying every day?
