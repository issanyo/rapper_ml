[Hook]
I’ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in
Walking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in
Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them
Empty out the clip then I’m hopping on that 110
Freeway, that i10 freeway
To that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway

[Verse 1]
Get your fucking body tossed off that freeway
Only Cali nigga with a beard like Freeway
Well James Harden too, but you know where he stay
Where my heat stay, chop a nigga like a cheesecake over these gates
It’s the projects, Pyrex for them objects, move waste so I flex
Lord of the Rings, totin' TECs for them Hobbits
God bless the P9X, stretch them niggas, here today
Gone tomorrow, etch-a-sketch them niggas
18th streets to the grapes
Niggas catching bodies over Jordan 5 grapes
Is it worth it? Yeah when you born worthless
Catch the bus to Beverly Hills and snatch purses
Preachers call us serpents, when they worship, so it’s us against them
Let the steam hit the skin when that pot working
From random tears to chandeliers
Pouring 40s for my peers, but my enemies

[Hook]
I’ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in
Walking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in
Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them
Empty out the clip then I’m hopping on that 110
Freeway, that i10 freeway
To that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway

[Verse 2]
Now I’m on that 105 freeway
Headed to that 710 freeway
Chickens on the move, nigga it’s a relay
I got them unmarked bills in that briefcase with that new face in that blue tape
Throwing Wingstop up out my window
You don’t like my flow, I guess it’s time to switch the tempo
I can pull a model bitch inside a Pinto, fresh as Mentos
Where you get them Js? Jordan sent those
Got my Glock cocked ‘case a nigga think he fit those
Get his shit blowed, like it’s endo, over them custom kicks though
Heart been cold, hot chain been froze, but it’s plated in gold
Ride around in those
Red Octobers in July, you got 'em, you lie, in red puddles
Peyton Manning with the cannon, nigga no huddle
No rebuttal, when you the king of the square, it’s no trouble
When the city love you
But them haters nigga

[Hook]
I’ll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in
Walking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in
Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them
Empty out the clip then I’m hopping on that 110
Freeway, that i10 freeway
To that 405 freeway, and that 101 freeway
