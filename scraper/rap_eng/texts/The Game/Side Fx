Get out, get in
Get out, get in

Get out, get in-in

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
Prescription, addiction-airy
Defining your habits
Positions, no missionary
I give good to the baddest

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Head over heels, they fall
Take two of these and call me in the morning (call me in the morning)
Over the counter
I'm all up and down your spine, this is your warning

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Loving me has got a side effect
You lose your mind if you try your best
That kind of high that you've been dying to get
Loving me has got side effects, side effects, sex sex sex sex

[Post-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Turn up
Make your body say
Make your booty say (ow)
All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
I'm all in your imagination, baby, I know every way in
You be at the Holiday Inn waiting
With your hands up high and your pants down low
I'ma get you high, we don't need no drug

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Head over heels, they fall
Take two of these and call me in the morning (call me in the morning)
Over the counter (the counter)
I'm all up and down your spine, this is your warning

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Loving me has got a side effect, yeah, yeah
You lose your mind if you try your best
That kind of high that you've been dying to get (dying to get, ooh)
Loving me has got side effects, side effects, sex sex sex sex

[Verse 3: Game]
She flow (she flow), she sweet (she sweet)
Make her tryna go deep (ayy)
Transform, from them pants on
To your birthday suit in them sheets (them sheets)
Versace, so what (what)
Face down, turn up (up)
Her girlfriends from South Beach
In town, tell 'em load up (woo)
Had a threesome at the Lamar Town
Tried a foursome by the Trump (oh, yeah)
And we ain't poppin' no mollies, man
Them girls do what they want (what they want)
They all want me (me)
As they fall on me (me)
So we're gon'a do my lawn (bring it back)
Keep calm, ball on me

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Loving me has got a side effect, uh, yeah
You lose your mind if you try your best (if you try)
That kind of high that you've been dying to get (uh, so I know you been dying)
Loving me is got side effects, side effects, sex sex sex sex (oh)
Loving me has got a side effect, oh
You lose your mind if you try your best (if you try your best, best)
That kind of high that you've been dying to get (oh, oh, oh)
Loving me has got side effects, side effects, sex sex sex sex (this one's for you, you know what I'm talking 'bout)

[Post-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Oh yeah, turn up

All the girls at the bar
All the girls in the line
All the girls in the yard
All the girls
(Loving me is got side effects)
