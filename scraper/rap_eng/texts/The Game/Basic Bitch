[Verse 1]
All you bitches is Nicki Minaj's sons
So get her a trash bag so she can pick up a one
She bend down, I see her tracks
I make it rain, she throw it back
And all this money keep me in pussy, no cat
Stacks, but I got racks on racks on racks
Pool side at the W, take a puff and relax
This that millionaire lifestyle, audemar iced out
Order more spades then, hit her with that lifestyle
But these fake hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass, and she beggin' for patron
My credit Meagan Good, my money Nia Long
And them heels you got on, pound sign

[Hook]
Basic bitch
I gotta bitch with me, she gotta bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' bout no basic bitch
Beyonc√©, laced front on
Who you trying to front on, and stunt on?
Basic bitch, she gotta fake Louie
Fake loobies, fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch

[Verse 2]
So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head to any nigga riding with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee Lo, F You
Cause everytime I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Downloading your swag, Starting off with your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls rose?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she routing for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho fo sho'
You up in every video takin' off your clothes
I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far
Melyssa Ford tears, seen her, her child's mad, that Honda Accord is
2012 Range, now look how times change
You bitches'll never get a ring, LeBron James
Cause I got all the game, used to move Daddy the King
Gettin' dirty money with my lil'

[Hook]
