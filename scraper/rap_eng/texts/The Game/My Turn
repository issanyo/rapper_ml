Aye yo, home, I'm number one mutherfucka (Fuck you.)
The Doctors Advocate, nigga. (Fuck you again.)
Just get used to me, man. You can't get ride of me, bitch

(Dj Skee WORLD PREMIER)
These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (HAHA!)
24 low on hearts on that '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn. (The Doctor's Advocate)
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin’
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn

I can hear niggas talking, whispering in the dark they're like dogs with no bark
When I pull over and park then guns starts to spark and the bullets find the mark
Niggas outlined in the chalk and I speak from the heart
When I say I killed you, it's simple and plain
Don't say shit about Dre and don't mention The Game
This industry is fake and I can't understand how a grown ass man
Sent a bitch to the pen, how you snitched on stan; he's a bitch like his man
He'd of did you for a grand. Eminem called him stan
I'm going to say it again
If I had one more chance I would've break all of his ribs with my bare fuckin' hands
I'm a gangsta on fire
You ain't, you a liar
You ain't got no pride, there's a snitch in the wire
Your fan base knows that you're gangsta is dying
I won't stop until that wanksta retires
I'm gone

These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 low on hearts on that '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin’
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn

These rap niggas hate and they smile in my face
You rabbit niggas mad, cause the turtle won the race
And, the radio debate what the fuck they going to play
All the hot shit is my shit; they take what I say
Play Scrabble with my words and put it on the front page
They go find a picture of 50 and Game
Say it's East vs. West; New York and L.A
Since I dont' button up, now I'm beefin' with Jay
Apologize in seconds
You niggas is reckless, you're not going to pay me to beef with a legend
My pride I'd protecting, the streets I'm respecting
I'm not trying to replace Pac so accept
After 5 million records; the Dr.Dre lectures; and 3 world tours
West Coast Resurrected
My form to the group of help was rejected
I felt abandoned so I threw away my necklace

These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 low on hearts on that '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn

After 20 magazines and a couple of awards
I can close my first chapter; put my plaques on the wall
To the top of the billboard
Who ever knew that I would sell more than Destiny Child and U2?
Or do a song with Busta, go neck and neck with Usher?
Went gold in a week, I'm a bad mutherfucka
This Gangsta Disciple and Vice Lord shit
Brown pride, Latin King
This is Blood, this is Crip
Hit the Impala switch
I keep a clip for any nigga that said I fuck his bitch
Or changed cause I'm rich, saying Game used to strip
Niggas weren't saying shit until I came with a hit
Now you want to see me dead, blood stains in his whip
Take a father from his son, put my name in cement
After I'm gone they're sample my songs
You can bury my bones but my music lives on

These niggas had a chance, now their shit is over
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Don't be mad at me cause I kept it rollin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
24 low on hearts on the '06 rose
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn
Let the sun roof back and I keep on coastin'
It's my turn, my turn, my turn, my turn

Aye yo, man, I don't really give a fuck about all that shit ya'll doing, that shit ain't making no noise. I'm saying that shit is bullshit. Man, why you niggas trying fucking kill my mutherfucka career? Man, Shit! It ain't going to happen, nigga. Not as long as my mutherfucka Bentley got 22 inch low in hearts on it, nigga. Shit! I'd be damn, nigga. I'm under the black ten light like "What!"
I'm rich Game, Bïtch
