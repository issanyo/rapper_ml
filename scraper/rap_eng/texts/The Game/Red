[Intro: Redman]
Redman in the building
Yo Game what’s good my nigga?
Gilla House
Black Wall Street, what’s hood?
You already know I’mma do it like this my nigga

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo I’ve been hustlin’ that’s where the fuck Red been
It’s Redman, infrared with a hairpin - trigga
When the red ring, I got bitches in Washington after my red skin
Red, that’s the color when it came out him
Red, that’s the name of the Game album
Red, I wear black, I look fly
Red, I’m getting head on the red eye
Red, put in work
Red, keep the airport security on high red alert
Red, what’s up Red?
You know Red to' up
Red, the color that Baby and Wayne throw up
Redman, the red necks they can’t stand it
I got caught with their daughter red handed
Red, I’m not rich but the paper good
So bring it on around a big boy neighborhood

[Hook: Redman]
Red, yeah yeah boy you know me
Red, that’s the color that my eyes be
Red, I’m on fire homeboy
And that’s that the color that’ll show you that I’m hot

[Verse 2: Game]
You mention Redman the wrong way it’s red dots
I put you in the sky nigga, Redd Foxx
Yeah Red Rum, Glock got the red beam
Give you red wings and I ain’t talking about the hockey team
I’m talking red rags hopping out of red wags
With a red bone, head redder than Sinbad's
And I’ve been bad before Michael Jackson was
That’s why the R.E.D. album got a Michael Jackson buzz
I mean I should get a red Michael Jackson glove
And grab my dick (HOOOOOOOO!), what’s happening blood?
Or you can catch me on the red carpet
Bitch rocking red bottoms, you can call her red scarlet
And just like the store you can be a red target
My shit butter, you ain’t never seen red margarine?
Red star with my face make ‘em talk a lot
Shut they ass up, red 'raris in the parking lot

[Hook]
