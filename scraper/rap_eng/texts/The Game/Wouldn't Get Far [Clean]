For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you
For you, baby, I'd find you
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around *** that *** Biggie and 'Pac
Like Rita Guerrero, *** took her to the top
She'll give you some brains, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some ***
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was 'Eye Candy' in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far?
And all these new video *** tryin' to be Melissa Ford
But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen but behind closed doors
She'd do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up, ladies
You wouldn't get far if you kept your legs closed
It would be best to wait your turn but you know
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you and you, for all y'all
Pop quiz, how many topless black foxes
Did I have under my belt like boxers?
Not to brag but if it add up
One, two, *** that's mad nuts
Game, you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
*** knowin' damn well they gon' call me?
The only dream of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a *** from my team
Head so good, he don't ask for a prenup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't CEO?
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo?
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo?
Well why the hell you think these *** comin' at me fo'?
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio, yo
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up, baby
You wouldn't get far if you kept your mouth closed
It would be best to wait your turn but you know
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you and you, for all y'all
I done had my share of *** with long hair
Short do like Kalissa, Halle in 'Boomerang', yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was *** with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you *** as long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a *** named Superhead he *** back in the day
The things *** do when *** sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a *** like Wonder Woman on that superhero ***
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model *** Takara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Galata
That's why I *** 'em today and then forget 'em tomorrow
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up, ladies
You wouldn't get far if you kept your legs closed
It would be best to wait your turn but you know
You wouldn't get far *** them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you, and you, for all y'all
Y'knahmsayin'?
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same ***
That was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh*** channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same *** that was in my video
Y'knowhatI'msayin'?
And then, y'knahmsayin', to make that even mo' ***
I'm watchin' Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same *** on Oprah
Floatin' away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the *** Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same ***
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah
