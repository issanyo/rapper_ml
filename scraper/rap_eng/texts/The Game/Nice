[Intro: Scott Storch]
Scott Storch, Game
Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The meanest the meaner, the second I seen her
Got me open, got me looking, losing all my control
The passion I’m feining, baby you're the new meaning
But I found myself tripping when you walked through the door
And I knowit's not like me getting beside myself
She got me feeling that way
And I know it's unlikely that you're gon' deny me
And just walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be that guy that don't have time to play
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game
It's looking like your neck are ready for my chain
She'll be that girl I’ll be waiting for
Sending me them signals that I can't ignore
Thought I was gonna get her on the dance floor
Then I saw her head to the exit door

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice cause she's got it
Do it whatever whenever cause she 'bout it
That deer nice cause I got it
Do it whatever, whenever cause I’m 'bout it
I'm falling for her
She's got me trapped
That girl is nice cause she's got, cause she's got it
She's got it, breathe, breathe

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Your body is screaming, believe that I'm listening
To every word you're saying, girl I’m loosing my cool
You bet you a soldier and I got me a rider
And you ain't gotta stress cause there's nothing to prove
I know it ain't easy being a sexy girl
That's always getting her way
But I’m here to tell tell you
You got me up on you and I won't let you slip away

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be that guy that don't have time to play
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game
It's looking like your neck are ready for my chain
She'll be that girl I’ll be waiting for
Sending me them signals that I can't ignore
Thought I was gonna get her on the dance floor
Then I saw her head to the exit door

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice cause she's got it
Do it whatever whenever cause she 'bout it
That deer nice cause I got it
Do it whatever, whenever cause I’m 'bout it
I'm falling for her
She's got me trapped
That girl is nice cause she's got, cause she's got it
She's got it, breathe, breathe

[Verse 3: Game]
Yeah, you niggas know now that it's 'bout go down
The club is packed up
The word around town that this is the jump off
You know when the shit drops that this is the jump off
I did it for Big, Pac
I'm pouring my Crystal, the bitches is too hot
They taking there clothes off, they yelling out 2Pac
Cause I’m from the west-side and they from the east-coast
My niggas from down-south, they letting their teeth-show
Cause this ain’t Def Jam and this ain’t Bad Boy, this ain’t Star Trak
This is the last call, they turning the lights on, the bar is shot down
I’m walking with Scott Storch and we in the front now, the bitches is with me, they ready to pop off
If you bringing your girlfriend, you gotta get knocked off, so hop in the 64 cause this 'bout the get down, it's going down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice cause she's got it
Do it whatever whenever cause she 'bout it
That deer nice cause I got it
Do it whatever, whenever cause I’m 'bout it
I'm falling for her
She's got me trapped
That girl is nice cause she's got, cause she's got it
She's got it, breathe, breathe
