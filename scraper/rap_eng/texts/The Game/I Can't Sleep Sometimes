Intro by The Game:
Yo what's Poppin? This is the motherfucking Game
The doctor's advocate
King of the motherfucking new hip hop movement
The west coast don
And I came to Amsterdam to say one motherfucking thing
Free Mr. Probz, Now!

[Verse 1]
Now let me cut to the chase
Countless scars on my face
Looking at friends, but they all seem so outta range
Staring at the cold body, of my little baby niece, deceased
Rest in peace, so the next day we meet
Sixteen, her heart just stopped
The cop's tryna bring her back
Minutes later, discover
She ain't got the strength for that
Ashes to ashes, damn this happens all the time
The Only thing I can do, is try to keep on living in my mind
Got em looking for clues, so please bring em to me
Everytime I feel shitty
I have the alcohol singing to me
I put my face on a sweaty pillowcase
Haven't slept in days
It's like I'm slipping
I gotta get out, pick up the pace
Waterfalls increasing
And it's like I'm breaking up into a million pieces
Mostly I don't speak about things like this
But yo I gotta keep it real with you
And share what I go through

[Hook]
I can't sleep, sometimes, I can't breath
These thing's gotten me so deep
Pushing away my fears when they grow
Open up my eyes, when they close

And when the night is falling
I hear them angels calling
What if it's you, to die the next day
No time to pray, and the devil takes you away

[Verse 2]
It's like every little thing's going wrong
Screaming at the top of my lungs
What the fuck's going on
No more sleeping to peace
Confusion creeps
I gotta pick up a pen
While I'm playing these beats
You see, the reason I'm like this
Living, I write this
Just straight from the bottom
On my heart, despite this, whole
Outside appearance
These are more than lyrics
I dont need no clearance
To be accepted in your point
I gotta keep myself calm
Even when he stops breathing
My chest beating
I see so many people leaving / sleeving?

[Bridge]
My tears dry
Everybody dies
In the meantime
I'm stuck on this drive
That's just everyday's life
Everyday's life
2x

[Hook]
I can't sleep, sometimes, I can't breath
These thing's gotten me so deep
Pushing away my fears when they grow
Open up my eyes, when they close

And when the night is falling
I hear them angels calling
What if it's you, to die the next day
No time to pray, and the devil takes you away
