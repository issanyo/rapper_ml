[Intro: K.Roosevelt]
Ohhh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime

(Game-Verse 1)
I'm sitting in my Ghost , I don't know what to do
What I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you
I always thought we'd kinda just end up like the Huxtables
Thought our love was like Swizz and Alicia, untouchable
Thought we always had that Jay and Bey potential
And ever since we've been apart everything is an instrumental
And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song I'm so numb inside
Miss you telling me boy I'm ovulating so just cum inside
I'm kinda torn between what I want and What I know
That's why sometimes after the kids fall asleep I get up and go
Used to chase me down the hallway acting like you on Broadway
Hop in your Benz , tailing my Range trying to jump out where that broad stay
And that was crazy but at least I know you care
That was then this is now how the fuck we end up here
Now we care about our instagram posts more than each other
Post some subliminal shit like we ain't never met each other , thats crazy

(Chorus)
Oh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime

(Game- Verse 2 )
We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads
That we forgot about the show and then Cali became the star
And maybe that was a blessing
Cause she could grow up to be Raven-Symone
In our discretion , I'd be right there for protection
These days my kids the only place to get affection
Could be wrong , you the school teacher maybe I just need correction
You Used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction
Now we both inside Greystone sitting in different sections
Pretending we had no fun
All I really wanna do is get you to that SLS and fuck you til you see the sun
Maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son
He ask am I coming home
And I tell him to go ask his mom
And Shit get real hard cause I can't live without my daughter
Why can't you just be Beyonce and try to ride for Sean Carter
You know I love my Kids and can't no nigga replace their father
This could be a love story , you the author , Write

(Chorus)
Oh I can only try so hard girl
Remember 9-5 like our love felt right girl
Maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in the next lifetime
