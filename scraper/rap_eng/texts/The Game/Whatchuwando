[The Game]
In that criminal mindstate I'm riding
And with the California crime rate, niggas is dyin'
Gotta get that money so I, load a clip in the 4-5
Ever since my brother died
Been on a murder mission with pistols, Hollywood homicide
Critics said Compton died with Eazy
One hand on the Holy Qu'ran, I'ma ride for Eazy betta believe it
In the 6-4 Impala heavily weeded
God as my witness Compton is alive and breathin
A nigga with an attitude and Bone Thugs
We ready to die, ready to ride, I stare Death in his eyes (yeah!)
Part the Red Sea with a heckler and Koch
And walk though the valley of death with a vest and a Glock
NY buried Christopher Wallace, Cali stressin for Pac
In my Jam J's I bust a shot for Scot La Roc
My life is real like 50's beef with Ja
The A-Team got the West on lock, muthafuckas

[Krayzie Bone]
We the original criminals
Therefore they'll be no replications
No second guessing the nation
Thug invasion got these suckas shaking
You've been waiting and anticipating
The making and the arrival of my thug congregation
AKA Desperados
It ain't hard to spot us either follow the trails
Of the hollow shells, as well as the rotten smell of body cells
How many of you niggas is ready to get down and dirty?
Watch me split rounds like a 30/30, word up
If you could just put on an instrumental and let a nigga run
It'll be like giving me a gun cuz I'ma kill everybody
Cuz you know you can't fuck wit da tongue
I come with the extra explicit elicit wicked
Call me Mr. Sawed off'll hit ya
Now take time out and pick ya shit up (get up)
Feel us, this the real nigga, the souljah feel nigga
Roll in control niggas and we roll with cold killaz
So you betta back up off us before we blast ya off us
And if ya think we joking, you'll be laughing in a coffin..(coffin) (coffin)

Original niggas (pump pump) say what you wanna do?
