[Intro: The Game]
Timbaland, Game (uhh) Gucci (uhh)

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Eight girls with me, all dimes, that's crazy
Timbaland and Game, Gucci Mane, young'n pay me
The wheels on my drop-top'll all stay crazy
And my lady's waist small but her butt that's crazy
Crazy, flyin down the interstate racin
Amazin, we step off in the club then go crazy
It's crazy, she crave me when she know she can't take it
Crazy, sex game, ice game crazy

[Verse 1: The Game Gucci Mane]
Yeah, that Gucci Mane Louis game crazy
Red LV bandanna, that's crazy
Brown Louis belt match the Air Ones gravy
Fly bitch with me like we fresh up out the Navy
Pull up at the club, 22's on the 'cedes
Roll down the tint, "Is that Game and Tim?" Yeah baby

Don't want no problems, all my dudes crazy, crazy

[Verse 3: The Game]
Uhhh, got a chauffeur but I ain't lazy

[Hook]

[Verse 4: The Game]

Try to jack me for my chain nigga that's crazy, crazy

[Verse 5: Timbaland]
Hmm, Timbaland chillin with my white wife sippin Bailey's
In the black-on-black Maybach like it is slavery
Chillin at the wind on the slot machine daily
"That's a girlie, g-girlie machine!" Nigga you crazy
Over a hundred thousand dollars on the daily
On the slot machine, "What dawg?" That's crazy
Larry Lyle - take this hundred thou' cause this shit don't phase me
But watch them niggas in they corner cause they keep pacin
Don't they know we be strapped like them government agents?
Cause we will be all over them like a tax invasion
Babe, let me lick on yo' pretty pink raisin
Get you to screamin and sayin, "WHOO, this is crazy!"

[Hook]
