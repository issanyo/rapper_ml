[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Aiyyo
The flow is here, the dough is here
The gon' call this the hardest remix of the year (haha)
The wrist is sickle, the nine is nickle (damn)
The inside tan, the outter pickle (wooh)
The dutch is rolled, the yak is poured (aight)
You running you mouth, I'm gettin you jawed (ouch)
I'm wavin the blade, I'm tellin you back up (back up)
You empty your pockets, I picking your pack up (gimme that)
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you don't know what block I'm in fronta (I'm right here nigga)
I'm out in New York, or down in the south (no doubt)
I'm out in the trap, with gold in my mouth (haha)
They book me for the clubs in the hood (yeah)
But niggas sacred to go, but Sheek Louch good (D-Block)
It's loaded when I get out the car, like
(La da daaa, laa daa daaaa)

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbyeee
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La da daaa, laa daa daaaa

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah, D-Block
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'mma send a bastard above
Before he give the police, the first and last of your gov
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
The two pussies they with, just make it a threesome
They buyin' out quick, you gotta buy your seed guns
Now they spraying magasines, 'fore they can read one
My glass jar had a hell of a rerun
(la da daaa, laa daa daaaa)
As we proceed son, had I known
Every hood got a street fan, if not they need one
I'm thinking short ranged, gimme a sport ranged
And when it get warmer, I'm jumpin' in the sauna
Duck when I'm passing by, put your head 'tween your legs
Kiss your ass goodbye

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbyeee
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La da daaa, laa daa daaaa

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
You niggas lost ya'll game, I'm throwin the rock down
Just to put ya'll D, I'm back on the block now
Running your mouth 'fore I shit all in it
All ya'll ass, and I'm about to dig all in it
I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas
Quick as that, I will earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas
Wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
What not to expose you niggas
Trist knife or razor fight
I got a year and a day
Still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through these jail without shackles and two cops
Throwing shit on the wall, not at the food slot
Got connects with pops, we boofin the weed planes
Hit my khaki's, watched them pressed for food stamps
Respectin the jail, or checkin the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have sex in your cell
You live with a gun, you like gettin hit from the front
Stand some shit, like two dicks with no bitch
Rumor has it, you like your chicks with no tits
F.Y.I. your P.S.I. said you snitch
How you blow trial and stay all rich, bitch
Now it's time to set it off
You got sumfin on your chest man the tech will tear it off
Mwuah

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbyeee
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La da daaa, laa daa daaaa

[Game]
Hurricane Game
Welcome to your funeral motherfuckas

[Verse 4: Game]
You rat ass nigga you run with the fags, you pussy
I shoot at your man put him in a bag you push me
After you flop im takin your fans
Give you a reason to do that dumb shit with your hands
Piss in your mouth and burn your promotional van
Come to your wake and slap all 3 of your fans
Get your mind right
Or get your mind put right next to them all white air nikes
Nails in your coffin leave them locked air tight
Let him scream G-unit with dust in his wind pipes
Drive him through north Philly, Brooklyn and Yonkers
How it feel to get fucked all the way from Compton

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbyeee
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La da daaa, laa daa daaaa

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Alot of niggas 'posed to be down, they most be clowns
Who think im trying to sign with Hov to get close to the crown
I take a couple Ooh's and Aah's, jewls and cars
Screw some broads, and I'm still cool with Nas
Ya real subtle still, so fuckin ill
How you can turn an idea into a couple mill
But everybody got they hand in the pot
So either you cut them off or hand them a knot
And I ain't neva planning to stop, im planning to rock
Till the rims matchin the top, and the Phantom is drop
They?ll neva get away with the shit I pull off god
Nice on the clutch even though I pull off hard
And you know the old kiss, you don't know the grown kiss
Got bout 5 in me until I get homesick
Still got access to the 2 tone bricks
Terry cloth sweats, and wally?s that pretty tone shit

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass goodbyeee
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
