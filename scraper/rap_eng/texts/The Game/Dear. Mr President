[The Game Talking:]

Aye yo Clue you got a pen?
Naw let me, let me use it holmes
I might make a mistake
Just gonna write me a letter to the President
Remember how Ice Cube did?
With the Death Certificate

[Verse 1:]

Dear Mr. President
I wrote you a letter
Everybody askin' about Hot 97
If I squash the beef
Thats my business man
My nigga got shot
And he didn't take the wittness stand
I got kicked out of G-Unit
No hard feelin's
And the Aftermath
Is me and Dre still chillin'
Had a press conference
No more killin'
Guilty conscience
Donated a half a million
And Al Sharpton said hip-hop was over
The bigger the stunt
The more albums get sold
But 3 hollow tip's left my nigga in the cold
In front of the radio station
Bleedin' in the cold
Meanwhile the gun man
Runnin' for the backdoor
I ain't see his face
Ask Sha-Money he know
I ain't got beef with Banks, Buck, and Tony Yayo
But they still airing you out on mixtapes
So?

[Hook:]

I got love for them
But I got hate for them
Should I let it slide?
Or sit outside and wait for them?
If I use the Glock 9 OR .38 for them
You gonna need a black suit and a wake for them

I got love for them
But I got hate for them
I don't know if I should lay 'em down
Or pray for 'em
Tell them nigga's if they ain't got cake for 'em
Then stop callin' Aftermath and Dre for 'em

[Verse 2:]

Nigga's sayin' Game you don't need no clique
You got the hood ridin' with you
Man fuck 50 cent
Soon as I turn my back they talkin' shit about me
Who wanna see 2 more rappers deceased?
Okay 50 got a gun
Game got a gun
He shoot me
I shoot him
And the media have fun
My music's still alive
Yeah I'm fresh like "uh"
New York and California carry our caskets through the slums
And any real nigga know if you gotta son
Shots pop off and you ain't got one you run
Homey thats real shit
Somethin' to deal with
I spent a 140 thousand and bulletproofed my wip
Cause nigga's hate to see you do some positive shit
First me and 50
T.I. and Lil' Flip

*Clue edited this part*

...Documentary dropped
And I can't take a piss without the hiphop cops

[Hook:]

I got love for them
But I got hate for them

[Verse 3:]

This is just a letter to keep the piece
Just to inform you on what happened in D.C
Me and Zooloo was cool
We was just chillin
How I get sued for 285 million?
I was upstairs doing a show for him
He went to the bathroom and somebody broke his ribs
I swear before God
I don't know who did it
So they can take they lawsuit and wipe they ass with it
Thats just the facts
I ain't touched that cat
I'm a good nigga
You can ask dre and busta that
Niggas will do anything just for the cake
Like Bobby Brown got me watchin' every step I take
Give a hug to tight that bitch gonna yell rape
Thats why I ain't had no pussy since my change of heart date
Dear Mr. President when do this shit stop?
P.S. I ain't ready to die for hip hop
