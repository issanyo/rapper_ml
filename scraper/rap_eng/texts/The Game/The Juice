You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby

[Verse 1: Game and Lorine Chia]
It been ten years since you heard from niggas from the West side
Now we on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga shot me five times, I'm happy to be alive
And my mama told me, "You got the juice now, baby"
My first album went five times plat'
Lookin' for California, it was on my back
I was 23 when I had my first kid
And his mama told him when he came out
"You got the juice" Like father, like son, uh
Top down, Mercedes throttle
Wrist lookin' like a nigga just played the lotto
I am to Compton what Ye is to Pablo
Run up on the car, just spray with hollows
I grew up in the six-trey Impala
Ain't make the league but I made the dollars
Recordin' my demo, knew Dre will follow
Remember, Eve told me

[Hook: Lorine Chia]
"You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby"

[Verse 2: Game and Lorine Chia]
Left the Unit and the world went cray
I blame it on the California mindstate
Too much weed, weather, women, chronic seeds, ass, titties
Can a nigga pour his Henny?
Without niggas actin' fake in his motherfuckin' face one time
'Fore I pull the .40 up out the waist line
I'm the first Compton nigga Dr. Dre signed
And Mary J. told me at Baseline: "You got the juice now, baby"
Then my second album went plat' too
And it was thug life with this Eazy tattoo
But I never forgot where I came from
Or where I got my name from, my grandma told me
"You got the juice now, baby," and here's something I can't forget
My mama brought a nigga up on that L.A. gangster shit
Your boy ain't never gonna change, mama
Here's some change, mama, and a Range, mama
She looked back and said

[Hook: Lorine Chia]
"You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby, you got the- you got the juice
You got the juice now, baby"

[Outro: Lorine Chia]
So much pressure applied, all this pressure applied
Pray this pressure applied to our lives
Feels like we gon' bust, feels like we gon' bust
Over gestures you die, ain't no question that I'm
Tryna make it out alive but sometimes
Feels like I'm gon' bust, feels like I'm gon' bust
Feels like I'm gon' bust, yeah
Feels like I'm gon' bust, oh
So much pressure applied, all this pressure, I'm fly
Greatest pressure, applied to our lives
We gon' bust, we gon' bust
