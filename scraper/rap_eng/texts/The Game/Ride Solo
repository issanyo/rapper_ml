[Verse 1]
Some nights I hop in that Impala feelin' like fuck the bullshit
Ridin' down Compton Boulevard with a full clip
Ain't stoppin' at no red lights, niggas gettin' smoked, where I come from
And to the T Flats, it's fuck niggas, they be on one
But you gotta worry about your own
Niggas'll fuck your bitch behind your back and leave a knife in that motherfucker
Infiltrate your home, same niggas you let kick it
Can't see 'em but you hear 'em like a cricket
And just yesterday ya'll was smokin' til he asked for a handout
Since you the good nigga always passin' the bands out
Gave him a stack, shit ain't never enough
It's a cold world, who can you trust?

[Hook]
When your baby momma trippin' and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with
And set up by the same bitch you used to go to school with
Sometimes you gotta ride solo, (sometimes)
Sometimes you gotta ride solo
Loyalty ain't the same
You ain't alive if you never felt pain

[Verse 2]
One of my niggas stole some money from a nigga, he was trippin'
That's why you never bring your homeboys where you livin'
Chose the wrong path, thought a nigga wouldn't find out
Laid up in LA, using the bitch as a hideout
Couldn't tell em shit and every time I cried out
He left me in the middle of the street like a wideout
Told 'em don't go, but he ain't listen, now he gone
Spent the rest of the night chirpin' the nigga phone
Next mornin' came, see my brother outside
Tears runnin' down his face, knew my homeboy died
And I'd be lyin' if I say I didn't cry
It been 10 years, still askin' God "why?"

[Hook]
When your baby momma trippin' and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with
And set up by the same bitches that you went to school with
Sometimes you gotta ride solo, (sometimes)
Sometimes you gotta ride solo
Loyalty ain't the same
You ain't alive if you never felt pain

[Verse 3]
Comin' home from the studio, nigga on your couch
Talkin' to your baby mama, fuck is that about
Raise a eyebrow, but you let the shit go
She a cold ass bitch, nigga, everybody know
But not at in the beginnin', she was fine as hell
So you went in her, fucked up, thought you had you a winner
And little did you know, she had niggas on the side
Tryna be a family man, had to let the shit ride
Whole damn time, bitch thinkin' she was slick
On top of you but mind on another nigga dick
Only think she ain't do was bring a nigga round your kids
Bitches ain't shit but that's just how it is

[Hook]
When your baby momma trippin' and your niggas on some bullshit
Gotta watch who you fuck with and who you fool with
Fuck around, get murdered by a nigga you was cool with
And set up by the same bitches that you went to school with
Sometimes you gotta ride solo, (sometimes)
Sometimes you gotta ride solo
Loyalty ain't the same
You ain't alive if you never felt pain
