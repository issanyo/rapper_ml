[Intro- The Game]
Motherfuckers should have never turned my mic on

[Hook- Good Charlotte]
Oh
Oh
Said Whoa
This is a fight
Said here we are
This is a fight

[Verse I- The Game]
You motherfuckers should have never turned my mic on
Out with the bullshit it's time for the fight zone
Black hoodie, black airforce ones
A nigga with an attitude got an airforce gun
Ready to get blood on my white tee
And civilian motherfuckers feel just like me (just like me)
And I got shots to give
So will there ever be another 2pac and Big
Ain't nothing you can do to stop this shit
Takes the rappers alive (but punk rockers live)
In the dark with no sunshine
When it's time for war we on the front line
Good Charlotte bringing the bass line

[Hook- Good Charlotte]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Dear Mr. President)
Said here we are
This is a fight (a letter to the motherfucking government)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa
This is a fight
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Verse 2- The Game]
From the hood to the trailer parks
State of course to the F for trading in our american flags
For all black rags, 'cause today we ain't shit
The welfare niggas and poor white trash
Dear America the fact is this
You're a soldier behind your back
You ain't jack but spit
Yeah massive, also gotta rap for chicks
Know we outside the white house for bags of sticks
This is more than rhyming, this is mothers crying
And the fist of free country, why is war designing?
Send my people to fight, when they don't know why they dying
This ain't a cry for help, this is Bush resigning

[Hook- Good Charlotte]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Dear Mr. President)
Said here we are
This is a fight (I'm writing a letter to the mother fucking government)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Bridge]
You gotta get up
Stand up
Just get up
Set up
Here we are (Dear, Mr. President)
You gotta get up
Stand up
Just get up
This is a fight
This is a fight

[Hook (The Game)]
Said Whoa
This is a fight (Mother fucker should have never turned my mic on)
Said here we are
This is a fight (Out with the bullshit it's time for the fight zone)
Said no, we don't want that shit
Said no, we can't take that shit
Said Whoa (Mother fuckers should have never turned my mic on)
This is a fight
This is a fight
This is a fight
