[Sample]
I'm gonna have a sweet life, sweetest life you've ever seen
And when the day is over, gonna go to sleep and I feel the greed
Momma can you hear me?

[Verse 1 - Juice]
I'm pushin a Cadillac man, it's black man
And I'm a black man, in a Cadillac man, see what I'm saying is?
Ain't no diamonds in the back, diamonds on my neck
D-Diamonds on my neck, D-Diamonds on my neck
I'm so fresh, so clean, edge sharper than a ginsu
Look at the soul of my Air 1's, see what I been through
Been through the struggle and drove through the fire
Kanye on the track, that nigga spittin' through the wire
I spit that pain rap, every chorus need a choir
Like feinds need suppliers, like Daytons to the wires
I'm rollin', rollin'
Turn my music up and keep rollin', rollin'..

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Verse 2 - Juice]
I got my back on the wall like a hustler
Smokin' like a muffler, waiting for the customers
I got that that weight, that they push up state for
Feinds can't wait for, enemies hate for
Me to make that cake or drive through the state for
P-H-X, A-Z is what I came for
Rock my chain for, hooked up with Game for
Headed to the booth, shotgun in the Range for
I could make change more, and my shit bang more
Bitches screamin' my name when I open them Range doors
When my ribs was touchin', ain't nobody know 'em
So tell them niggas, picture me rollin'

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Verse 3 - Juice]
Homie I'm just rollin', rollin', thinkin' 'bout the past
They said I would never last, so even if you trashed
Keep rollin', rollin', and I got a stashspot
Niggas is killin' so my stashspot, got a stashspot
Roll up the window, roll up the endo
Blow it out the sunroof, share it with my kinfolk
My niggas in the grave, my niggas behind bars
Man, there's too many of ya'll, but ya'll know who you are
Gangbangers in the hood, and they shootin' like stars
And the gangbangers I know don't wear shoes with the stars
They tie bandanas, and they shootin' out cars
So I had to turn it around, and start shootin' out bars

[Hook - The Game]
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Turn the music up, we just rollin', rollin'
Let the windows down and keep rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'
Picture me rollin', rollin'
System on blast, just rollin', rollin'
Foot on the gas, we just rollin', rollin'
Man, we just rollin', rollin'

[Outro - Juice]
Yeah, it's a Blackwall Street recording
We got the Juice now niggas
Haha, gone
