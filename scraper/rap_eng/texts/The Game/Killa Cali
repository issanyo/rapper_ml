"It ain't never mother fucken cold enough to rock no mother fucken chinchilla out here nigga and timbos to heavy to run from the fucken police man in my mother fucken converse"

(Hook)
In killa kali we don't wear timbos or furs
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Keep a gun on me and I love NY but
It's California till I die one more time
In killa kali we don't rock timbos or fur
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Push that range rover when I'm in NY
But I love the way Impalas drive

(verse 1)
I take the fat laces in n out them converse
I put them hollow tips and a nigga if he converse
About me and my niggar and how we use to have priors like richer
Yeah I paint that picture
I use to have visions of retiring like jigga
Five albums later acquiring those figures
I'm that nigga if I don't get no bigger
I'm back in the hood lettin the 4 0 flicker
From a brown paper bag 4 0 sipper and push a rock without knowing no clippers
On my nephews life I never met no nigga rich or poor nigga that couldn't make a O bigger

(Hook)
In killa kali we don't wear timbos or furs
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Keep a gun on me and I love NY but
It's California till I die one more time
In killa kali we don't rock timbos or fur
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Push that range rover when I'm in NY
But I love the way Impalas drive

Billboard (verse 2)
It's just me chuck and some nigga I'm raised with
First niggers red chucks new york pavement
Whips and chains like we on that slave shit
Never seen queens bridge on that brave shit
Niggas see the grave quick livin the fast life
In cali we burnt out new yorkers mad trif
Tells niggas once so they don't ask twice
Ain't that right chuck?
I'm a hot non 7 never been out of compton
If it wasn't game I probably never see harlem
We goona take jones to the knickers in garden let him fuck a blood bitch in a dirty apartment
Niggers know forvidi on that hard shit
But don't don't know billboard give em a hard clip
Sometime revolvers no shells no nothin
And I love the east cost but fuck joe buddens

(Hook)
In killa kali we don't wear timbos or furs
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Keep a gun on me and I love NY but
It's California till I die one more time
In killa kali we don't rock timbos or fur
All stars khaki chuck taylors whats the word
Push that range rover when I'm in NY
But I love the way Impalas drive
