You wanna get down
I get down right
(Repeats)

If I met Beyonce today I'd tell her I love her
And maybe we can play... under my curtains
The dream I had about you last night
I am telling you now
Lights off so we can have the destiny child
... Jay-Z who's got the best of you now
We can watch (?) and you can wrestle me down
One night stand one night into town
One call to make sure you're home that's how I get down
Like Keisha (?) flow so I am gonna take it easy and put the patrol down
Go to Merry (?) get some weed to blow you're my big brother... know
Living the good life

I just wanna fuck (repeats)

She ain't never been shit
New was not now talking shit
All I did was fuck her
She's mad of all these celebrities...
Nothing but a gangster posted in the...
I know you post it when you see us
Fly real high higher as we wanna be
I got Justin Simpson call me...
Fly white bitches but I am gonna be...
Tell my nigga game only...
So we can get that cheese
We got bitches that can make it happen over seas
I could fly... sexy Rihanna
Kind of look like Rihanna

I just wanna fuck (repeats)

She is (?) it's time to take her home
And the (?) cd is time to get dope
It's 2 o'clock in the morning
And I am mowing
One hand on the wheel
The other hand get her pussy
I want it the way she's screaming
I'm drunk I am (?)
Walk or dreaming
... this is wheel one
Before I get you home
Baby you will come
... explosive before she notice
I'm gonna get you under hypnoses
Get you open while I make love to your mouth
I pull it (?) coming out my mouth

I just wanna fuck (repeats)
