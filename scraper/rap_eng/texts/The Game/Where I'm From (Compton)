[Verse 1]
Ay man, fuck this nigga, I'm one of the toughest niggas
Bring the most hardcore or the buffest nigga, watch out let me snuff this nigga
Who that? The true rap vet, pull up in two black Vettes, just me and Tommy
A bunch of bounty hunters behind me
Do it the ski mask way, I'm a legend in the making, go ask Jay
Bars smokin' hot like roaches in the ash tray
King amongst kings, just remember one thing
Many tried and died, I'm speakin' on niggas that wanted my bling
Pull first, blast, I ended up takin' they shit
Back to the studio, turn it up, back to makin' them hits
I got two sons, two guns, used to beef with these two bums
Thought about lettin' off two shots to watch his crew run
Contimplated puttin' money on they head but it's just rap
Hit Nas, he told me "don't get down like that"
It's time to strategize, fuck bitches have 'em feed me grapes
But all I could do is think about this 40 eatin' your face
You mothafuckas just don't know how the beef was erased
I ain't call him, he called Jeezy, Jeezy called so we straight
For now, but I still got one brow to the ceilin'
And a loaded Glock .45 that's ready for peelin'
I make a call, more killin', you make it out, Lord willin'
See life is a card game and I'm the mothafuckin' dealer
I see you, where the killas? See your chain, where the millions
Walk with me, I'll show you where Benjamin Franklin is livin'

[Hook]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from
Compton son, ain't nothin' nice

[Verse 2]
I fuck with the Kayslays the Clues, Drama the DJ Poohs
Whether or not they fuck with me, I'm like Jay I will not lose
Been winnin' since the beginning, before Dre, before my records was spinnin'
I was down in that chowls fuckin' the finest women
Ask your favorite R&B bitches, pick one
Any one, I dicked 'em, never licked 'em, she looked good till she spit cum
Used to bang her like a kick drum, she'd be screamin' and shit
Yellin' my name, just think ten years back I was dreamin' this shit
Thinkin' 'bout whippin' a sports car, you know the Beamer is sick
Blowin' out the sunroof, gangsta leanin' and shit
Maybe I'm trippin' cause gangbangin' was all I knew
Grew up in a Crip neighborhood used to wanna be Snoop
After my brother died I could've swore I would end up in blue
Whoever knew young Jay would turn out to be a Piru
Stole a red rag from the liquor store and started a crew
Where gangbangin' is just somethin' to do
Mothafuckas

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm from where the old people say "put your gat away" and they bang Donny Hathaway
And the O.G.'s is trippin' cause lil niggas ain't wear they rag today
Same 'hood where Game good
See yellow tape and white chalk where the lames stood, all the news reporters blame Suge
Some niggas ain't from here and need a ghetto pass to come here
Where Old English is more than just a dumb beer
Grew up across the tracks but I been on this side for some years
Witnessed too much pain to tattoo it all in one tear
Some niggas move away and never ever come back
They say Compton died with Eazy, guess who bringin' it back
No disrespect to other rappers I just made it here first
Inverse my verse you silly mothafuckas makin' it worse

[Hook]
