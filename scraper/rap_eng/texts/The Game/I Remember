[Hook: Game]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Baking soda and a Triple Beam, I remember
Loaded fully auto-magazine, I remember

[Bridge: Future]
I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names, but if you
Put that pussy right up in my face, I remember, the way she put it down
On the flo', I remember, the way she bring it down on the pole, I remember

[Verse 1: Game]
Pop the pussy don't play with it, I don't care if Kanye hit it
I don't care if Jay hit it, I'mma eat it up and I'mma lay wit' it
We shot a choppa' at the gun range, got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang, got a off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember), Roll up that Purp' (I remember)
Po' up that surp, (I don't remember) How Tunechi had that purple slushie
Comin' out that blender
Got a Keisha, got a Ronda, got a Neisha, got a Tanya, got a Teisha
And had a Honda, and I eat her Anaconda
Got condomds in that condo, got kush greener than Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow, You already know

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Got a Rolls Royce, got a black Benz, Got a bad bitch, with some bad friends
She bring em' through and I fuck them, but I don't fuck with them in public
Got random bitches just walkin' up, they be like "Do you remember us?"
She show me that tat, on her ass, and I be like "I remember"
Chop it up, like a blender, I fuck then I befriend her
Got a red bitch call her Ginger, Ass and Cash on my agenda
You buy the bitch, we rent her, she took the cash and I sent her
That pussy prolly' so tight, callin that shit 'Illegal Tender'
(Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up), That's a young nigga dinner
Fish eyes to a fuckin' Lion, that's Visene, nigga never cry
We the young niggas wild'n out, talkin' shit to niggas that's 35
Yo daughter pull in my driveway, I smash that in overdrive
