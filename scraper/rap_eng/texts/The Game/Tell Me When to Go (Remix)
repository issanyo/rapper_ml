[Hook- E-40]
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Tell me when to go, tell me when to go
Dumb, dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, d-d-dumb

[Verse 1 - E-40]
This burgundy colored slushie got me feelin' like the man of steel
Extreme Hyphy energy drink, spinning steering wheel
Mardi Gras beads around my neck, invisible set
Pull outs, diamonds in my mouth
Rally stripes, hustle cars, vans and campers
My dude got handlebars, get out your cameras
Wet the tar down, break out the crates
We on the soil ice skatin' doin Figure 8s
King of slang, they call me E-Bonics
I get stupid and dumb like Just Ice and Mantronix
Hear me out
The first mothafucka to even speak about a drought
40 a fool, I hear he growin' out his hair
You swear? Yeah he's takin' it there
This party music, get used to it
The Hyphy movement

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Kanye West]
Ay, pimp it's Ye, pimp
40 told me they fuck with me in the Bay, pimp
So I'mma ride down with the do's open
Yeah that's the way to get the hoes open
Yeah, high inch stilettos with the toes open
And any haters get they nose broken
Now tell me when to go, tell me where the hoes
She told me they was cold now you act like you don't know
Like "ummmm, ummmm", I'mma hit the liquor store
I'mma be on the low, I'mma have my hoodie on
If you call out my name then you know they gon' go
Dumb, you fuckin' up my mode, man
I told you only call me by my codename
They already recognize me from my gold chain
The same one I gave Keyshia Cole, man
Now go dumb like Cole on Martin, I'm retarded

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ice Cube]
Tell me when to go, niggas get silly
Ice Cube on the mic, 5150
Nothin' but a fool, y'all know who with me
A West Coast nigga name E-4 liquor
We can drink malt liquor till the party get thicker
Then I get sicker and go gorilla
Rollin' through the Bay, doors open, man
Freaks on the sidewalk, hopin', man
That they can jump in, get a little somethin'
Yell Geronimo, bitch cause I gotta go
Burn rubber, leave it in the streets
Leave it to them dope ass Lil Jon beats
To make you go bezerk till it hurts
Put in work, if you scared; go to church
Shake them dreads, nigga fuck them feds
I'm with E-4-O, tell me when to go

[Verse 4 - Game]
Yo, I get hyphy
In Bapes, All-Stars, Adidas, Hurricanes, Timberlands and Nikes
I'm so hyphy, snatch up wifeys
Got half the niggas in the NBA tryna fight me
I put down the ball, picked up the tech
I'm nice around mics like Ron Artest
Play better for the West, 40 Water I'm on one
Jesus had dreads, so fuck it I'mma grow some
Then I'mma shake my shit
After that have a bitch braid my shit then chop it off and fade my shit
If L.A. is back, that mean the Bay is back
And the top on the CLK is back
I get dumb, dumb, with the windows tinted
Cops pulled the Benz over ain't nobody in it
Ghostride the whip, ghostride your shit
And when I get writer's block I goes ride your bitch
It go front, back then I pull it out
Now gas, brake the car peelin' out
First Master P, then Pac, then I came from the Bay
Don't do it for me, nigga do it for Mac Dre
