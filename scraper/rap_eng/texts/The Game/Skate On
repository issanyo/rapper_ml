[Intro: The Game]
Lupe and me, red Ferrari
2010 infinity

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Where the Almighty know, well alrighty then
I'm all mighty ho call me mighty Joe Quinn
With Josephine Baker in the Benz
On them shiny toes, glass slipper niggas with your Cinderalla chins
I'm a shark in the water, you see my flippers and my fins
The pool is my palace, go and send them niggas in
Rockstar, lets take the Bentley for a swim
I run the world take your hood to the gym
Stretch it all out, get it all thin
Back on my fat shit get it all again
Rap on my back bitch, hip hop on my brim
You think you're high now
Well thy style's no higher than my eyebrows, this should be a sin
Cleanse, flow clear kinda like how air look
Or like a Cinderella pair look
Or like Cinderella barefoot
No matter how many ankles of crews
The moral of the story, you can't fill my shoes
Lu!

[Verse 2: Game]
(Mass murderer!)
And in the last verse from Lupe, touché
Ferrari drop top, but it came with a toupee
Niggas say they got cars like us, but do they?
Rap Phantoms, pack tannoms and strippers from Atlanta
Ménage à trois let 'em fuck, I watch
Stay on my J-O, Rolie when I'm punching the clock
Up on the block, everything mine, I stay on my grind
Chasing dollar signs, bumping Nas, it's halftime
And I'm the G-A, money signs, easy nigga
Don't want shit for free but weezy nigga
Load the Glock up, cops pop up
You can go to Iraq, take all the straps, come back and couldn't stop us
Aston with the top kush, paint job rock dust
Hand what I got in the trunk and get us all locked up
So fuck niggas and I'm talking from behind the trigger
Now come get a nigga, cause I'm sick of niggas

[Hook]
Hatin' on me, you wastin' your time
Nigga wanna kill me? Then go and stand in that line
Kill that shit, I ain't tryna hear that shit
I know you hear that shit, so nigga

Skate on, skate on (with your bullshit)
Skate on, skate on (Lupe tell em nigga)
S-S-Skate on, skate on
Me and my niggas tryna stay on, skate on

[Verse 3: Game]
Usually wake up early like them Philly niggas
In the weed spot rolling kush A-R go get a Philly nigga
First smoke a not, we swimming it hard rock
We push it out all spots 'till they get us up off blocks
Straight for the bout pots, then bag it in in Banglocks
Watch for the top cops cus we nourish our own crops
Smoke it like blood clops, inside of the drug spot
Will take em to Van Gundy, big man on the block
Don't worry bout my residentials or my credentials
My flow a cocktail through a Def Jam window
That's for Shekyan, I'm the rapper niggas fear
No need for Craig Mack to kick the flava in ya ear
Keep the Lambo in fifth gear, catch me on a sunny day
Paint drippin' like Lil Weezy in Baby tears
King of LA I think I made it clear
Ain't nobody outselling 5 except Eminem and Dre this year

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Game]
Now I've been rappin' for 9 years, 4 months
45, 46, 47 seconds, I was Doctor Dre's weapon
Had the option to stay and kept swerving
Made some rookie mistakes but so did Kyrie Irving
If Fifty was Lebron on a bad night
Or Floyd Mayweather when Manny Pacquiao did his jab right
I fucked a bad bitch but that was last night
And I ain't gon' say no names but she be singing, and her ass tight
This year I'm gettin' my cash right, 30 years old
Let Drake or Soulja Boy live fast life
Who ever said The Game wack, change that 'fore the thing clap
Niggas fucked up rap, I bought the flame back
Couple albums later, still the same cat
And my P-O, only motherfucker thinkin' that I ain't strapped
Next time you doubt me, I'mma have my accountant down south me
You can do this rap shit without me
I'm out G in a 2011 Audi, 22' Pirellis oiled up like the Saudi's
About to pick Lupe up from the hotel
Yo Pharrell, let em know
