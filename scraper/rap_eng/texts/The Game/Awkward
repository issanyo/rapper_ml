[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favorite song

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah, why you still texting my mama?
You can let it go, she ain't calling back
Why you still tryna start drama?
We ain't even together, where they do that at
Why you still calling my niggas bro?
I'm just tryna get to way it was before
Back in the day, when you had your own friends
Where them bitches at? You should go and hang with some of them

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
'Cause this shit is just awkward, yeah
Girl, this shit is just awkward, oh woah
Baby, you don't see me, hanging with your sister
Baby, you don't see me, liking all her pictures
Baby, you don't see me
So tell why everywhere I look I see you?
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]]
Girl, I understand you're tryna get it popping
But just understand with me, it ain't an option
And if you're tryna holla at someone I introduced you to
Baby, it's gon' be a problem
'Cause they gon' choose up
'Cause they know I'm that nigga
And my bank America account got six figures
Word to YG, my nigga, my nigga

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Man, this shit is just awkward, yeah
Girl, this shit is just awkward, oh woah
Baby, you don't see me, hanging with your sister
Baby, you don't see me, liking all her pictures
Baby, you don't see me
So tell why everywhere I look I see you?
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG

[Verse 3: Game]
You know I, you know I, you know I
You know I hate to break your heart like this
Plus we ain't start like this
We started up a Maybach together
Used to lay back together
We go way back together
Don't know why you at my mama door
All in my DM's
All these niggas walkin' past you left and right
You don't see them?
We can't be friends 'cause this the end
Let's make amends, instead of actin' crazy
I recommend you see other men
It's other fish in the sea, so take a swim
She tryna work it out, I told her save that for the gym
Your attitude's a 5, and this bitch I'm with's a 10
And I just brought a straitjacket for you, so get in

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Man, this shit is just awkward, yeah
Girl, this shit is just awkward, oh woah
Baby, you don't see me, hanging with your sister
Baby, you don't see me, liking all her pictures
Baby, you don't see me
So tell why everywhere I look I see you?
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG
Girl, this shit is just awkward
Let it go, baby LIG

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
You should LIG
Let it go, baby
'Cause you're looking crazy
Yeah, you're looking crazy, girl
