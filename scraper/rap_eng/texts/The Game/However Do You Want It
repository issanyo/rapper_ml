[Intro]
Oooooh-ooh-oh-ooh, ha-ha
Steady, are you ready? What's going on?
Steady, are you ready? Are you ready?
What's going on? What's going on?

[Bridge]
Cold rushed air
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm down, take a look around
What's going down?

[Hook]
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
Bongo by the way
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?

[Verse 1]
Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these niggas luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special 'cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holdin' your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, lettin' my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fuckin' mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Gettin' the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake
And I'm comin'

[Hook]
However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?

[Verse 2]
Don't compare me to shit, I ain't none of you niggas
I'll smoke your lil mafia in front of you nigga
Left Aftermath 'cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga
It's lit, came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly, anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flyin' Spur, top missin' like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfuckin' whoadie
Love when niggas act like they don't know me
'Til I start shootin', remind 'em of the old Kobe
S'life

[Hook]
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)

[Bridge]
Cold rushed air
Feel the melody that's in the air
I'm down, take a look around
What's going down?

[Hook]
However do you want me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me?

[Verse 3]
Nigga, I'm my own Suge, report to nobody
Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammys, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-O
Ask Kanye, "Who the real asshole?"
Cuban links, smokin' a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'ma fuck 'em all, right hand on the Bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbin' on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle
Said this the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
No more parties in LA or Chicago

[Hook]
However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
