[The Game]

Look ma we go together like throwbacks
And airforce one's
I'm a gangsta
That's why i gotta carry 4 guns
Used to be a good girl
Now you my ride-or-die chick
That's why I copped a Bentley coupe
Instead of buyin' bricks
In 96, used to do the homocide thing
Now we in the win doin that Bonnie and Clyde thing
And nigga, you can't play wit my yo-yo
She keep a fo-fo and the H2
Sittin' on low pros, whooaa
And 50 know, she roll with 50 hoes
And keep them sticky dro
Right under em' Vicky clothes
Hit mail roles and shail toles
And wife beatas, get Nike whifee
She in love with addidas
Ma, I'm in love with Anina
Chuck Taylor's in that stash by that 7-45 beamer
And the way you give back shots
Like Venus and Serena
Have a nigga on stage gangsta leanin', oooh

[Chorus: The Game and 50 Cent]

If ever you need someone to go to
Someone that holds you
Someone to be by yo side
Baby if ever you need someone to talk to
Someone to hold you
Someone to be down to ride
You can count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you could count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you can count on me
It's game baby
You know you can always count on me, ha ha

[50 Cent]

Baby girl it's ya touch
That turn a frown into a smile
It's somethin about how you make me feel when you around
It could be when we tuck
I suppose when you lettin me bite ya neck
Foreplay just a red tonge all in your breasts
It's playtime, dont rush we could get to the rest
In the hood a new lexic fo wet sex
Look I got plans to see the world girl
And we could go together
After spendin' time together, we may go together
Plus I got some extra paper, we could go together
That means mo' ice, mo' meets, mo' leatha
Yo wishes yo dreams, to sit in Bentleys and lean
Will all come true, there's nothin' I won't do
From the hood life to the good life
Baby lets spur
You listen to me, you'll love me cuz im good with words
50 speak game like game
It's not a game, im not playin'
Baby do ya hear what im sayin'?

[Chorus: The Game and 50 Cent]

If ever you need someone to go to
Someone that holds you
Someone to be by yo side
Baby if ever you need someone to talk to
Someone to hold you
Someone to be down to ride
You can count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you could count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you can count on me
It's game baby
You know you can always count on me, ha ha

[The Game]

Yo holla at ya boy
Come polly with ya boy
Look ma', hop inside this Impala with ya boy
So we could hit Beverly Hills
Fly down the back streets
Roof missin', Marc Jacob bag in the back seat
You trina eat? we could do lunch at Mr. Chow's
You tryin to ride? thats in Compton with them pistols out
Buyin' birds, I got G-Unit niggas in Queens
That they get to rock and roll like Bruce Spring's thing
Its Aftermath nigga Dre coachin' the dream team
03, we gon shine without the bling bling
A 100 gangstas, and a 100 hoes with us that wanna roll with us
BET awards show with us
It's Compton's bad boy
Got my main bitch with me
And she get them white bars out the park like Ken Griffy
Signed to Dre, now bitches wanna get it in with me
And they goin' and cop my albums just to hear it from me

[Chorus: The Game and 50 Cent]

If ever you need someone to go to
Someone that holds you
Someone to be by yo side
Baby if ever you need someone to talk to
Someone to hold you
Someone to be down to ride
You can count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you could count on me
I'll be there for you
Girl you can count on me
It's game baby
You know you can always count on me, ha ha
