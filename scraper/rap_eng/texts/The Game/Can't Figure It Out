Can't Figure It Out - The Game ft. Black Wall Street

Lord forgive me for killin outta control
Got the spirit of big will pourin outta my soul
Gangbangin or put a tag on your toes
If you down for a drive by nigga we gottta role
I know they hate me 'cause im out chasin dough
But id rather be doin that
Then dying behind these hoes
Tell hunned I need sumtin to hold
Bust a couple of shots in memory of my nigga foe
You at home nigga
I swear to god ima empty out this chrome shit and never left you alone I
Solemnly swear even though you in heaven with mars berg theres still apart of you here and I
Solemnly swear my nigga was the best at cookin yay
Since we was yay high
Im in love with that life
Dont hate me 'cause that bastard that I am
Is just the thug in me rite

(Chorus)
Lord I can't figure it out
Why you took my nigga from me
We out here huggin the block
All night tryna get this money
I just can't figure it out
Why you took my nigga from me
We out here huggin the block
All night tryna get this money

You already know who it is
And how I play the game
Wat you think im suppose to change
'cause I fuk wit game
Im addicted to these streets
And this beat is automatic
Dont speak if you dont wats static(?)
Say we hit you nigga
Gotta team of young niggas
That come and get you nigga
Grippin 2 2 3's until they flip you nigga
21 gunshots and new real thugs n killas
Hey you know I clear the block for my nigga my nigga
But ima make it happen for ya

(Chorus)
Lord I can't figure it out
Why you took my nigga from me
We out here huggin the block
All night tryna get this money

Why you took my nigga from me

All night tryna get this money

As hard as it is for me
Homie I got to spit my hearts hurtin

Billboard real ass nigga the worlds gonna miss you nigga
