[Intro]
Red Aston Martin Vanquish
V12, sick
Red cranberry juice in my vodka

[Hook]
Game so violent, give me a Backwood, roll a violet
Blow the smoke out and scream "violence"
Only thing slow a nigga down is the violin
Yeah, the violin, yeah, the violin
Game so violent, pass me a dutch, roll a violet
Blow the smoke out and scream "violence"
Only thing slowin nigga down is the violin
Yeah, the violin, yeah, the violin

[Verse 1]
I do beats so fuck Beatles
Niggas see me in Vegas
Blowing trees, gettin’ head in the Venetian
Vehicular manslaughter when I’m behind the ‘Vette
Voluptious 22s and you ain't seen these yet
Zero to sixty, vomit
This chick riding with me from Venice
And she out of this world, like a comet
Play with balls like Venus
Head game the meanest
And she used to model for Victoria’s Secret
So I’m victorious
Word to Notorious
Screamin’ out victory, never became a victim see
I’m the vampire, sink this teeth into your bitch neck
Give her VVS stones and keep her fucking wrist wet
Jimmy Iovine give me big check
Cause I valeted the Valentine's Day massacre
Put it on his desk
Then I vanished, in a red Vanquish
And left Interscope banging Dipset

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Who’s the first victim with their blood spilled on the horizon?
Come through with more niggas more behind me than Verizon
I’m that villain like Ren was
You see what my pen does
Start a fucking riot with my pen cause
I’m that nigga turn your man into a vegetable
Stripes validated, like Clue I’m a professional
Spit on video vixens, still fuck Vida Guerra
Another word and I'm cumming on your mascara
Let your mouth be the venue for this vendetta
Valet parked this Beretta, in your V-neck sweater
You know who I’m talking to
I could vent but thats for mine, I spit venom
Cause half of these rap niggas is vagina
Speakin of vagina, Vidal Sassoon
Your bitch, my room, her head vacuum
And this ain't no verbal assault
We outline enemies in any vicinity

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I heard Jay got the vapours
Dont respond, I rape 'em
Give em one bar John ?, Venezuelan, yeah
Flow sick, top models be the vaccine
Drop top Phantom, bangin’ "No Vaseline"
Niggas ill, come and burn down they village
Getaway car, Dodge Viper, missing the ceiling
See I’m ’bout millions – love fucking Virgos
In a village somewhere, sipping on Merlot
Game so vicious, yeah nigga, they know
Broad day, broadway, blow like volcanoes
Eat like Sopranos gold bars and ?
Word to Funkmaster Flex, there's a vacancy in New York
So I volunteered to be the new king
New car, new ring
Show you how the Westside do things
The Southside do things
Bring out the choppas
Wear a vest, cause these shots ain't no vodka
