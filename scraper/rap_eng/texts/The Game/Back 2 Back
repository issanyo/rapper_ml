[Intro: The Game]
Sometimes you gotta remind niggas who you are


[The Game]

I make kilos finito
In my hood I'm deebo
In new york I'm on 1, 4 5th
With 10 khakis throwin ceelo ask niggas
It's all about that cash niggas
Use the benjimans to wipe my ass shit
The guns I blast
The bricks wrapped in plastic
Call it a felony, jayo pass the desert eagle niggas
Is talkin we haulk em out line chalk em out
Keep on walkin like nothin happen
Over rappin u a dead fuck
All they seen is 2 niggas runnin in blue and red chucks
Gun smokin till the chrome go cold
One blood one loc inside of the 6'4
I kill MCs like real MCs
Watch him go from platinum
To go like my D's bitch please get yo ass laid flat
Niggas tryin to be the king but the ace is back

[Jayo Felony]
So unforgettable so unfuck wittable It's Pitiful
And do that to em put him in critical
Blowing up shit like he air time mad at these niggas
Never be shit bishop you don't even matter
It get intense don't it ?
It make some sense won't it
Shit if I'm sayin it it gotta make some sense I'm on it
Understand it we goin back like a sam sandwich
All that sugar water man I mange just look
See I'm immune to you you can't affect my system
I bring doom to you, boy you just another victim
I keep the upper hand killer the advantage is mine
You gonna need a wax job nigga when I damage ya shine
I'm like starbucks I get em a media boost
If ya disappear it will (?) loose canon whose standin bitch
I'm like 2Pac you knowin that I get around
Ask money b

[The Game]

Let me get em, business as usual against all odds
