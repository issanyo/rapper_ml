My love for you...
Is like a angel flying through the sky
Like a bird in the winter and...
Your love for me...
Is so deep, and sorta like a black rose cracking the cement
My love for you...
Lives on like the memory of Aaliyah singing a last song
Your love for me...
I'll never die like a black child struggling the ghetto to survive

[Verse 1]
My heart goes out to the beautiful woman that raised me
20 years after the wats riot early 80's
Pops on drugs, moms couldn't take me in
Had a daughter already said she was to young to feed another baby
And shit got crazy, then 2 years came and went
Baby's just growin' away, we can't even pay the rent
No hot water, I reminisce tears running down my face as I hold my daughter
You spent years by the fire place, I was in the garden every Sunday at the church
Bible study at the cartends, I was hardhead
Back then I was selling crack
When your hard earned money paid for basketball practice
Always at the game on time, yellin' at the coaches
Wondering why your babyboy's sittin' on the pine
Even though life gets hard sometimes, I keep my head up
And I can make the sunshine in just one rhyme
Walk with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In and outta lanes in that 57 Lincon continental, peddle to the floor
Lookin' for the highway to Heaven, remember when your babyboy was 7
We had good times like I was Jay Jay and you was Fleur the Evans
I should have listen to the Reverend, now I drain my pain in this 40 ounce
And these born ass records, disrespectin' your house
Livin' reckless, look at me, inside your jewelery box
About to pawn your necklace, every night you were in the window, lookin'
But what you do when your grandson's crooked, and he too old for whoopin'
Used to tell me I was smarter than that, took me down to the Compton, swapt me
Bought my first starter hat, pulled over raider jacket to match
A pair of Levis, a number 8 Jordan's with the all black straps
When you died my soul cracked, can I get a soul clap
I'm walking without a heart, can somebody hold that?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got a lot of things I wanna ask the Lord
Like why I can't see my grandmother face no more
And why I can't seem to live without her
And if I pray could He send her back to me one day
Cause Heaven too crowded, everytime I think about it
I'm missin' your smile, can barely cope
My angel is gone, I'm heartbroke, drownin' in my own tears
Somebody throw me a rope or spread my wings so I can fly
I'm ready to die
Might cry but I'm still a man, might be a man but I still cry
Big mama, my angel in the sky
If you wanna feel my pain, then close your eyes, hold your breath
Now that's too close to death, open your eyes
See the light now and if you love your grandmother like I love mine
Go, tell her right now, I know how this might sound
But my plan is to show you that I understand, you are appreciated!
