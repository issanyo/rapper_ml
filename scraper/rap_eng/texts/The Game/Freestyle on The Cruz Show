Your first topic is

"The black mamba Kobe Bryant"

Kobe Bryant
When I be rockin' my Kobe's I'll be in, um

[Verse 1]
I'll be in a red Rolls, white ceilin'
No body, no casket, just blood spillin'
I ain't a new President but I love killin'
They like, “Game, where ya been?”
Blood chillin'
But not on no islands and villa
I’ve been lost in Compton with some drug dealers, uh
I bought the Relapse, loved it, hit the block, hugged it
Kobe still makin' crack, the new Kobe shoes-ism
But I ain't seen 'em in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
Them shoes got more game than niggas at the Rucker

There he is
