[Verse 1]
Windex on the 6's, birds in the grill
All these diamonds in my light, can a mothafucka chill
Take my wrist to the jeweler, wrap it with a half a mill
Take the other half of that, show you how to stash a mill
All these niggas say they ballin', I don't see it when I see 'em
Know how that thing go, see 'em wouldn't wanna be 'em
Black 745 doin' donuts in the BM
Gettin' head when I drive, who wouldn't wanna be him
Red carpet at the BET Awards in my street clothes
.45 under my tux, follow the G code
2011 Phantom, nigga I suppose
Cut the top off that ho and call that bitch Amber Rose
Ridin' down Sunset, model bitch jerkin'
Police lookin' in the car, close the fuckin' curtains
California king, that's for mothafuckin' certain
And we grow them palm trees where the fuckin' leaves purple

[Hook x2]
We smokin' all night, we smokin' all day
We in the finest cars on the interstate
And when they out of dro, we poppin' Rosé

[Verse 2]
All I do is smoke kush till it make me delirious
On the .45, T.I., I'm serious
Worth twelve mill if a mothafucka curious
Show up with more Bloods than a bitch on her period
Challengers and 'Maros, Maserati steerin' it
Hundred street bikes, nigga fast and the furious
See, I'm on my Mickey shit, not the fuckin' mouse
Throw my black ski mask on, run up in your house
Three and a half chickens, we was in and out
Like who the fuck still stash birds in the couch
Dope boy flashy, headed in the wrong direction
Sold my first key, now I think I'm like Inception
I think I'm Harry O, I think I'm Monster Kody
I think I'm Game, bitch sippin' on a monster 40
We got that half bake, evidently
All you niggas want me dead, nigga come and get me

[Hook]
We smokin' all night, we smokin' all day
We in the finest cars on the interstate
And when they out of dro, we poppin' Rosé
