I'm a live wire, I'm on fire
Half man half harlem from the mother f***ing wire
After ma first album a couldave retired
But am back on those gold wires burning rubber off the same tires
My flow is so reckless
I stay around legends LLs old neckless
Eat rock him take for breakfast?
What a spit out makes djs blow the dust off the old records
Time to dust off the old lexus
I'm just trying to ball and rap like r tess is (am all texas)?
Am screwed up
It's hard to make moves when your stuck on the block like tetris
I'm so caught up in who the best is
I got drunk in the studio and caught maself trying to text B I G
Cause MC in is dead throw up your lights
Hip hop style? for the ghost rider
I've been writing on my own
Since I was just a kid (THE BLACK FRANK SINATRA)
I've been writing on my own
Since I was just a kid I swear to you
I will never do what these rappers do
How many of u bust a** rappers know what a MC is
What MCS do what MCS did
U should shake the hand of a real MCS kid
And kiss the mother f***er ground where us MCS live
I've been writing my s*** slice and s*** dice and s***
Rachael ray with a knife and s***
Niggers still bite my s***e
I'm a professor with words all the law studants like my s***
Confess what a heard na am gonna bite ma lip
And turn my ghost riding check into ice on my wrist
I'm hardcore hardcore like throwing dice on the bricks
Hardcore like a knife with that junior mafia b****
She had a ghost rider but shes a b****
Nigga u got a ghost rider cause u a b****
I should jab this mother f***ing pencil in your throat
Cause u wrote a few lines that don't make u dope
