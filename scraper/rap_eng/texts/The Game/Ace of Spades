Ace of Spades
If you like to gamble I tell you I'm your man
You win some loose some it's all the same to me
The pleasure is to play makes no difference what you say
I don't see the green the only color for me is the ace of spades the ace of spades
Going for the high one dancing with the devil
Going with the flow it's all a game to me
Seven come eleven snake's eye is watching you
Double up or quit the devil takes a split the ace of spades the ace of spades
You know I'm born to loose and gambling is for fools
But that's the way I like it baby I don't wanna live forever
Don't forget the joker
Pushing up the anty I know you've gotta see me
Read them and weep the dead man's hand again
I see it in your eyes take one look and die
The only thing you'll see you know it's gonna be the ace of spades the ace of spades
