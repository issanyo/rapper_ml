[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & Compton Menace]
You already know what it is man you know I'm high as fuck

Niggas know shit crazy man, but I still the same nigga cause I still fuck with my same niggas
Ya feel me

[Verse 1: Compton Menace]
Now look I know they love it cause I bring in better days
Probably thinking ‘bout paper I’m feeling a certain way
Inflicted to roll the trap of the truck on a certain day
My haters I know they love me just need me to lead their way
Just ducking them alphabets, but yet play with the K's
Hopped in bought that 6, holding money like a bouquet
But hey no hope my real niggas gotta get it
Million dollar homes and next week we’ll be in it
Talking about the way we fuck them bitches and purps
Pick em up by the fourses and then we get to the nude
Repping this money hard all the way from the first
All my niggas is real to the game and staying true
But look niggas been the same since the same box
Shared the same shoes even shared the same Glock
Saving greens even played for the same team
But now I’m saving dreams, reality but I’m still me

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa, Compton Menace]
Ain't no changing me
Still fuck with the same niggas I grew up with
Still thug with the same niggas that I thug with
All my day ones, that's who I fuck with
Ain't no changing me
Still fuck with the same niggas I grew up with
Still thug with the same niggas that I thug with
All my day ones, that's who I fuck with

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Throwing up the hood, rolling up that good
Never slipping even though I thought they wish I would
Got a couple homies and all of them different poppin'
Held the bottles in the club, but leave all of them spending comfortably
For rolling up that game, smoking till I faint
Smiling at you haters while I'm laughing to the bank
And the shit I got on you can't afford this
Let's get it clear every year I make the Forbes list
It don't make dollars don't appear is gonna make more sense
Jump in my cars it's like "yeearrhh" when I'm going in it
In this game I was born in it
Seen way too much shit to let these lame niggas go and win it
So I came up had to switch the game up
Told you when I was young nigga hustle get the change up
Now everywhere I go they throw my gang up
Everybody blog everybody Taylor'd

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Compton Menace tell 'em it's goin' be another murder suicide
Hit the store grab dem Vegas dice shoot the five
Shoot the fair one know that rugar fly
Los Angeles King ain't never no question 'bout who was I
Boss of the hubcity know I brought my thugs with me
Ace gone and drenched on know I got that snub with me
I'm in your face like a buck fifty
Want 25 to life nigga hop up on this truck with me
Chain hanging gang banging and I'm no stranger to the 'cain slangers
Since '95 air max 95s nigga I'm high I'm dumb high
Got all these lyrics in my head I'm like a fucking dump drive
Ever since I was a young Jason nigga held the pump real high
Cutting holes in fitteds I can fit into
Just to get into some shit far away from Compton High
No diploma nigga still held Compton high
That's why

[Hook]
