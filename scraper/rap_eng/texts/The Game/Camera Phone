[Verse 1 : Game]
Picture me and my gangsta girl, riding with the top back
Bangin Ne-Yo, my neck freeyo, my sox hat
Tilted to the side like you know I get my grind on
Get my shine on
Jewelry Black in all rhinestones
Rims spinning like a globe, on these low pros
Do it big cause im supposed to floss
And thats the reason she break me off
Cause I'm gangsta
And I'm ridin wit..

[Verse 2 : Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yo, its a thug and a gentleman
Rollin like a boss through
No matter the cost too
Not tryin' to brag but money's not an issue
Don't let your girl see us
That might make her diss you
Cause if she roll wit us
She won't even miss you

[Verse 3 : Game]
Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack
Before it hit the ground she throw it back
When I make it rain thats chump change
That pay for the 26 on my range range range drive drive
Take the wheel while I roll and slide
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
And once again its on
You should take a picture with your camera phone
Playa she not comin home
And if im on her screen saver, that, that mean later we gone
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me
If I let her take a picture
She gonna roll wit me
Gonna roll wit me
Gonna roll wit me

[Verse 4 : Game]
If you dont know by now baby im a star
Look at my face
Look at my car
Look at my waist then look at my scars
Look out da window see where we are
In my phantom, in my rover, bangin..

[Verse 5 : Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yo, its a thug and a gentleman
She ain't never rolled in a car wit da suicide
Girl when its you and I, they commitin suicide
All of them want, my girl
Cause she pretty and thick in the thighs
Homie dont mastermind
Do a song wit suicide

[Verse 6 : Game]
She call me Jay, I call her B
We gettin married, to the streets
I'm chasin money, she chasin me
I'm right where I wanna be
With the B on my Bentley
The horse on my Lambo
Crown on my Cadillac
Checks on my Air Max
Haters, better fall back
Before I put somin in your ball cap
Thats my chick, I got her back like a bra strap
Cause she fine and she cute
She think she all that, and she all that
Thats my girl thats my world

[Hook]

Game can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo can you take a picture?
We've been waitin all night, just to take a picture wit you
Game can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo can you take a picture?
We've been waitin all night, just to take a picture wit you

[Verse 7 : Game]
Grab da wheel take control
And let your hair blow inside my lambo
Pull out ya phone, picture that
Take it home let ya man know I'm hittin that
While im hitin that
She send it back
She drop it low

She so Ciara
So Eve
So Mariah
So B
She so Trina
I'm R Kelly
She remind me of my goldies
I'm cooly high, I'm cochi
She a 34 D, im so pleased
I'm So So Def, she so Janet
I'm JD and she full of me
In da H2 we fold deep through the NYC off no sleep
I hate to drive but I break it wide
When im ridin wit my shawty
I'd kidnap her and neva take her home
Ridin off bangin ne-yo sittin on chrome
In that mazaradi, see the paparazzi
They (flick flick flick)..she gone
