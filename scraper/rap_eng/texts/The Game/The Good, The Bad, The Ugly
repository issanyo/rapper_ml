[Intro]
Yeah, you can keep asking them fucking questions all fucking day, man
Told you that, I told you the fuck happened, man
Told your partner the same thing, man, how long a nigga gotta stay here?

[Verse 1]
There was money on the table with the bricks
I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
Heard my car alarm going off on my 6
So my dogs start barking and some niggas hit the fence
So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Indo
You niggas ain't doing shit, but stealing my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rolling with...
Nah, I ain't saying shit and I ain't snitching on nobody
Yeah, that's my four-five, but it ain't got no bodies
And two dead niggas? Them is nobody
They shoulda torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
Man, fuck this shit I thought I told y'all

[Verse 2]
There was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table chopping up some shit
Listening to Jeezy and I heard a little *bullet sound*
So I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'
Oh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my four-fif'
Seen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka? Let me get a cigarette
I don't even smoke but shit, y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
'fore I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Yeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas run around the hood singing, they should get a Grammy
And you two mothafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process
Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years
No evidence, no bid
I don't know who split them niggas' wigs

[Outro]
Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walking to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barking, there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the four-fif'
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store
