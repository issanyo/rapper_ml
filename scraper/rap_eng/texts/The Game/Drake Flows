[Verse]
Who with it
The gun spitter, young home run hitter
MoÃ«t sipper, hit you with the flow like Biggie
King of this rap shit out the park like Griffy
I make my guns out at the park, come get me
The Desert Eagles make a nigga move like Missy
I'm always in the Bentley how the fuck could you miss me
I'm always on the charts I know why you niggas diss me
'Cause Black Wall Street getting deeper than the '60s
Them boys in the hood lay you down like Ricky
So run, catch them hollow tips like a frisbee
I pitch cocaine like Frank Lucas
Niggas talk that American Gangster shit but can't do it
I put these whack rap-niggas in a scope and bloaw
'Cause I promise the homie Kim I will hold his brother down
I'm more focussed now, I'm like the golden child
Put both of your hands out and let you hold my style
Motherfuckers
