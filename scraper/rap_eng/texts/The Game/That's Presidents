Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, 'cause niggas tryin' to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner

Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6 with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee

'Cause I play for the Bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge

I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

It's Telly and young Game, the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Yale or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet, I'll come back with 10K in the drop

I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggas can't stop us dawg

So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggas that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president
