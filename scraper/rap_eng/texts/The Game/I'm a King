[50 Cent]
I never said anything, I never take anything back

[Young Buck]
Well you kinda heard me speaking
"You ain't a crip like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game"
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
But now, you know alot of these dudes jump in the game
And they rap artists, and that's exactly what they is
But they not what they say they are when they rap it

[T.I.]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given, and it ain't cause what I'm doin for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin how I'm livin
Not to mention when I'm rappin, I'm just hurtin niggas feelings
And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house, the record sale went thru the ceiling
So say what you want, and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggas'll come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coup√© with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

(The Game)
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin drug dealin, some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
Cause to me, murderin wack mc's is somethin like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggas throwin up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
And be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - impala with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech

[The Game]
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass layed back
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
Or get your ass layed back
Fuckin' with Black Wall Street & Pimp $quad Click Get

[T.I.]
Layed out like a drunk, on the late-late
So haters hate, the hell with all the hearsay
From wednesday to tuesday, T.I.P. act a fool, hey

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top knocked off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king, disrespect it, I'll hit your brains with the TEC
