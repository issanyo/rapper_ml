Chorus:

So many nights i grind
Late in the morning time
Oh i can't go inside until it's over
I got a barn full of dimes (whole barn full)
And i got my nine (stressin' real shit here ya feel)
No i can't go inside until it's over (real spit man)

(hoo hoo hoo)

Verse 1:

Yo, '92 i'd be 12 years old
My mama had the '98 sittin' on the vogue
Lil' Guda showed me 28 grams in the "O"
Oh, 16 of them thangs to make a whole
They kill my nigga Hollywood outside the studio
I pour the liquor for my nigga blowing fruities tho
I can ease the pain, relax, release then let it go
But if i ever see them niggas i'ma let it go (let it go)
Shoot out the club, crucial, on some dumb shit
And that's what the fuck i call a crucial conflict
Rent late and my kids need some new shoes
This High Point, keep jammin', need a new a clue
Hate to say it but, i settled for a GED
When half these rappers ain't got diplomas on BET
I got a bench warrant, and 12 getting closer
I pray to Allah they don't run our boys all over

Chorus:

So many nights i grind (so many nights i)
Late in the morning time (late in the morning)
Oh i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s over yeah)
I got a barn full of dimes (barn full of dimes)
And i got my nine (got my nine)
No i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s All over)

(hoo hoo hoo)

Verse 2:

So many familiar artists starving like marvin
Eating that track like double stacks
Plus cheese, added mixed in with rap
Mathematiks, dark alleys, and addicts
Trap tactics, plastic automatics
Automatically turn pockets rapidly into rabid
Here is the score, children of the corn
Popped like kellogs, making a beating heart stop
Like an abortion, most of us was forced in
And the rest of ya’ll niggas, practicing gangster
Ask about the trap another night
That’s what i think

Chorus:

So many nights i grind (so many nights i)
Late in the morning time (late in the morning)
Oh i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s over yeah)
I got a barn full of dimes (barn full of dimes)
And i got my nine (got my nine)
No i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s All over)

(hoo hoo hoo)

Verse 3:

I can’t go inside, not until it’s over
Some of my partners died, their tears on my shoulder
A real stand up dude, this game cut tho
So i don’t want nobody ‘round Game but fo’
Got a barn full of dimes so i’m grinding hard
The money always on my mind so i’m grinding hard
It’s like it never ends, the game ain’t ever over
Hope when my barn gone, i’m still looking over my shoulder
//
Late night Hollywood row cooking four and and a half
Break down with dimes 50’s, 100’s fast
I been working with the work, J quit the trap
Short stop niggas lean with them candy ass
Tuesday morning roll blocks at my front door
Givin’ J’s cold knocks, so the hustle flow
Like Terrence Howard, got ‘em lined up like dominoes
And uncle Fred just can’t wait to test it tho

Chorus:

So many nights i grind (so many nights i)
Late in the morning time (late in the morning)
Oh i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s over yeah)
I got a barn full of dimes (barn full of dimes)
And i got my nine (got my nine)
No i can't go inside until it's over (oh oh til it’s All over)

(hoo hoo hoo)
