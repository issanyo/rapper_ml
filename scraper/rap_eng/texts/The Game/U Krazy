[Intro:]
Big things come in small packages motherfucker

[Verse 1:]
Man look at the wheels the motherfucking wheels, black (??) bloods
You niggas know the deal
Fuck lamborghini doors nigga I ride stock and fuck you lil rap niggas homie I buy pac
Dude told me long time ago joy is pain
You sell 5 million records some shit gona change
He was right I traded the coupe and got me a range, no ice to black diamonds in my black wall chain
You know I'm gonna ride and ain't shit change
But the right to claim both sides (east side west side!)
Niggas know me down in best style, blowing sticky with them crookland kids
Hit switches on the Brooklin bridge speakers banging I'm going going
Big took you there and game recognize game dont play me homie
You think cuz I'm a millioner I won't spray you homie

[Verse 2:]
It's only been 12 months I lost a few friends
Had my baby mama bust the windows out of my bens
Hip hop police on me every city I'm in, well hell, me and low dipping again
3 wheel motion chrome spokes on the rims
Run up on us watch that.38 revolver spin
I'm rich game bitch I made a few mill now the 64 impala got a Paul Wall grill
They say I moved out the hood I ain't keeping it real so I took the projects back and put it on top of the hill
I'm hungry, still rap like I ain't got no deal, you can pop that cristal but nigga I pop steel
I'm going diamond I put that on my unborn child
I'm almost dead I ran 99 miles
Bitches they used to diss me they feeling me now they say I rap like I'm from New York and they like my style

[Hook:]
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna shoot
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna drop something
You don't really want it better stop fronting
Cuz when the things come out we gonna drop something
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna shoot
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna pop something
You don't really ain't it nigga better stop fronting
Cuz when the things come out we gonna drop something

[Bridge:]
This can be the day you get richer or this can be the day you try
This can be the day you walk away or this can be the day you die

[Verse 3:]
Yeah motherfucker you hear my shit in the club when you do know 9 out of 10 times I'm in the club
Stop fucking with cristal I can't pay that price
I take a 20.40 ounces and a bucket of ice
Pour it on my niggas now they flooded with ice
Niggas hate me to mu death cuz I'm loving my life
I can walk through any hood I payed that cost
I ait'n felt disco since I got shot in the hearth
27 years old put the tell on the porsche 27 covers from double xl to the source
Dr. dre choose me to cary the torch
I spit cuz the D.O.C lost his voice

[Hook:]
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna shoot
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna drop something
You don't really want it better stop fronting
Cuz when the things come out we gonna drop something
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna shoot
You krazy I say when the niggas gonna pop something
You don't really ain't it nigga better stop fronting
Cuz when the things come out we gonna drop something
