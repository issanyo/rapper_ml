[Intro: Game]
"I don't want to feel like I can't..love God or appreciate you know'm sayin', Jesus and have to put down my blunt. I want to smoke you know'm saying maybe you know, shower up then go to church you know, get the word walk outta church maybe smoke again maybe hit a strip club or two and you know do me
But I don't want to be ridiculed you know'm sayin'

[Verse 1: Skrip]
Yeah
There's only one truth and no in between
I Took a look at my watch, It's time to Intervene
Only God can judge you? Then if that's the case
Then we must prepare to shrivel before his face
There's a final destination like
Whether you a child of the dark or light
Or sure that you living right
If you have an ear open wide and hear me though
Yeah, uh
Life in the fast lane, shrimp and the champagne
Bullets ricochet like you ain't feel a damn thing
But there's two different sides like a campaign
More than presidential stored up in the mental
Like night and day, black and white
Let's take it to the front row like pastor's wife
But we push truth to the back trying to mask it right
Thinking you good 'cuz you pray before you grab the mic
Nah, but it ain't like that homie
Gets heavy out here like a spiked bat's on me
Swinging on the narrow when his eye on the sparrow
But His eyes on you and you living like you the hero?
But really you a villain hanging like a fan on the ceiling
Objectifying women, perverting children
Listen up, relax no time to shrug
On the bright side discipline comes to those He loves

[Hook: Skrip]
Hallelujah
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 2: Skrip]
Ross caught the Holy Ghost, Kanye the God flow
Meek said Amen but they ministry ain't five fold
God will spit us out His mouth if we ain't hot or cold
A big decision to living homie you got a soul
I marinate the thoughts I penetrate
And with every single drop of the lips you levitate
To a place where you question your fate "is there a better way?"
And if truth is fallin' off then It's time to set it straight
Whether feenin' to Crack whips or crack pipes
The shades of grey in life won't change what's black and white
Look around existing is a negative
You close cousins with lies the truth is not relative
Not to you but hold on and embellish it
In a world so cold rough tusk like an elephant
Renegade of the world so I message it
Praying for your life with the words that are heaven sent
Real talk

[Hook: Skrip]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 3: Skrip]
If we two face we make a dent like Harvey
An appearance of Holy but we ain't godly
Keep the Bible on the side like Kimosabi
But the words inside ain't what we copy
You think you living good, day off like Beuller
Easily measure yourself by the rich young ruler
In response The Christ you respect said "no man is good"
But we seem to neglect Him
But He died, was buried and He rose for you
And deep inside you know what you supposed to do
It ain't modifying behaviour it's being changed by the Saviour
We can't serve two masters we enslaved to the hater
The serpent an enemy who's distorting the remedy
You're depleted feeling defeated and wasting all of your energy
So finally, you're left with a decision
A righteous mission or prideful living
Open up the Skrip, it is written

[Outro: Skrip]
Hallelujah
Jah
You wanting, wanting, wanting
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Oh, oh Hallelujah
Oh
