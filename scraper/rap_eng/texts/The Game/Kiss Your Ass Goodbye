The raw uncensored street shit

Nu Jerzey Devil
This is a Dj Skee premiere

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa

Aiyo, the flow is here, the dough is here
The gon' call this the hardest remix of the year
(Ha ha)

The wrist is sickle, the nine is mickle
(Damn)
The inside tan, the outer pickle
(Wooh)

The dutch is rolled, the yak is poured
(Aight)
You running you mouth, I'm gettin you jawed
(Ouch)

I'm wavin the blade, I'm tellin you back up
(Back up)
You empty your pockets, I picking your pack up
(Gimme that)

You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you don't know what block I'm in fronta
(I'm right here nigga)

I'm out in New York, or down in the south
(No doubt)
I'm out in the trap, with gold in my mouth
(Ha, ha)

They book me for the clubs in the hood
(Yeah)
But niggas sacred to go but Sheek Louch good
(D-Block)

It's loaded when I get out the car like
(La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa)

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa

Yeah, D-Block
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley's black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'ma send a bastard to bug
'Fore you get the police, the first and last of the gov

These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em the bleed comes
The two pussies you with, just make it a threesome
They buyin' out quick, you gotta buy your C guns
Now they spread magasines, 'fore they can read one

My glass jar had a hell of a rerun
(La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa)
As we proceed son, had I known
Every hood got a street fan if not they need one
I'm thinking short ranged

Gimme a sport ranged, I wanna get warmer
I'm jumping in the sauna, duck when I'm passing by
Put your head 'tween your legs
Kiss your ass goodbye

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa

You niggas lost y'all game, I'm throwin' the rock down
Just to put y'all D, I'm back on the block now
Running your mouth 'fore I shit all in it
All y'all ass and I'm about to dig all in it

I birthed you niggas
I fed and I burped you niggas
Quick as that, I will earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas

Wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
What not to expose you niggas
Trist knife or razor fight, I got a year and a day
Still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through these jail without shackles and two cops

Throwing shit on the wall, not at the food slot
Got connects with pops, we boofin' the weed planes
Hit my khaki's, watched them pressed for food stamps
Respectin' the jail or checkin' the mail

I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have sex in your cell
You live with a gun, you like getting' hit from the front
Stand some shit, like two dicks with no bitch

Rumor has it, you like your chicks with no tits
F.Y.I. your P.S.I. said you snitch
How you blow trail and stay all rich, bitch
Now it's time to set it off
You got sumfin' on your chest man the tech will tear it off, mwuah

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa

Hurricane Game
Welcome to your funeral motherfuckas

You rat ass nigga you run with the fags u pussy
I shoot at your man put him in a bag you push me
After you flop I'm takin' your fans
Give you a reason to do that dumb shit with your hands

Piss in your mouth and burn your promotional van
Come to your wake and slap all 3 of your fans
Get your mind right
Or get your mind put right next to them all white Air Nikes

Nails in your coffin leave them locked air tight
Let him scream G-unit with dust in his wind pipes
Drive him threw north philly, Brooklyn and Yonkers
How it feel to get fucked all the way from Compton

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa

A lot of niggas supposed to be down, they most be clowns
Who think I'm trying to sign with H.O.V. to get close to the crown
I take a couple oo's and aah's jewls and cars
Screw some broads and I'm still cool with Nas

Ya real suttle still, so fuckin' ill
How you can turn an idea into a couple mill
But everybody got they hand in the pot
So either you cut them off or hand them a knot

And I ain't neva planning to stop, I'm planning to rock
Till the rims matchin' the top and the fantom is drop
They'll neva get away with the shit I pull off god
Knifes on the clutch even though I pull off hard

And you know the old kiss, you don't know the grown kiss
Got 'bout 5 in me until I get homesick
Still got access to the 2 tone bricks
Terry cloth sweats and Wally's that pretty tone shit

You can kiss your ass goodbye
(D-block, D-block, D-block, D-block)
La, da, daa, laa, daa, daa
