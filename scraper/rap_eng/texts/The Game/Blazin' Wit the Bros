[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
I know that bitches is checking for me
I know that they do whatever for me
I know I look good and I got a nice ride
And I stay in my back 'cause I got my own vibe
And I know that they don't get a chance from you
She told me, "Eazy, I got plans for you"
I know she look good and she got a fat ass
But she's just my type, normally I would smash
But tonight I'm just

[Verse 2: The Game]
Uh, the Ace is gone
Weed smoke in the air, my face is gone
Petite felit, yeah, my face is on
Can't none of y'all face the don, Jayceon
No mask, glow in the dark bottles
No glass, walk past my section, you trespass
Murder the club, toe tag
Balenciagas, killin' niggas, .44 mag
The body bag crew, comin' soon to a club near you, bet your bitch there too
Bet the ass on the ass, then drag like Betty Boo
Bet I feel like Hov on a run, you ready boo?
Back ties then reagals, black cars medieval
Black guns illegal, be charge and fresh seagull, uh
Can we celebrate? Turn bottles upside down 'til every chick  in our section start to levitate

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Gettin' high, chillin' with my bros (with my bros)
And you know I got a gang of pre-rolls
Gettin' high, blazin' with the bros (with my bros)
Talkin' 'bout these hoes, yeah (sheesh)
Gettin' high, chillin' with my bros (with my bros)
And you know I got a gang of pre-rolls (sheesh)
Gettin' high, blazin' with the bros (blazin' with my bros)
Tryna dodge these hoes (it's Eazy)
