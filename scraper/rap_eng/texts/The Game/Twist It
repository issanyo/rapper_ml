Olivia, let's go
What's up ladies, I'm back baby
The boy wonder got the club goin' crazy
I'm two-steppin' in my armor, in my 80
But I ain't in the VIP unless they pay me
It's like I practice stuntin'
Ma, I have ya mattress jumpin'
And I know it sounds like I'm frontin' but I ain't
Jerk, jerk ya body and work, work 'em proudly
Go and hurt somebody if I don't hit that
If you don't see 'em with me don't ask 'bout 50
'Cause if he was here he'd be standing right here
And if you don't care so much about my fame
Then why you keep starin' at my chain
I'm doin' my thing
From the club to the telly on a late night
Box of Magnums, sippin' Henn, finna get right
Checkout time ain't 'til daylight
From the club to the telly on a late night

{Olivia}
Ooh babe, you know I like it when you feel on me
Pullin' on my waste, I'm feelin' energy
Gettin' kinda hard to keep ya hands off me{Yeah, right there}
So slide a little lower, put ya hands on my thigh
Maybe I know you like it if that's right
I'ma show you how to make it last all night
Now let me see you shake it

{Chorus}:
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Work that body, gettin' so crazy
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it
Work that body, gettin' butt-naked
Don't hurt nobody up in this party
Twist it, shake it, bend but don't break it

Mix a little hypno with some Hennessey
Like the way this jig goes when it goes through me
Think I need to stop because I'm feelin' tipsy
{One more drink}
Baby now I can't stop 'cause I'm in the zone
Shorty keep it comin' boy, I'm grown
I don't want to finish this dance alone
Ooh I want to see ya

{Chorus}
Row, row, row down low, shake it fast for me
Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party
Now let me see ya
Row, row, row down low, shake it fast for me
Work your body, don't hurt nobody up in this party
Now let me see ya

{Chorus}
