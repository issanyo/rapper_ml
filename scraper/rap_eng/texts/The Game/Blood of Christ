[Intro]
We gonna let this motherfucker breathe for a minute
It's still aftermath, it's still aftermath
Now when I said we gonna let this motherfucker breathe
I meant this motherfucking beat is dead
Were gonna preform CPR to bring that motherfucker back to life
Now let that motherfucker breathe

[Hook]
Compton's my city, that motherfucker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life, them motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Them motherfuckers that killed Biggie
Them motherfuckers that killed Biggie

[Verse 1]
Notoriouses, bring that Benz in
I'm about a dollar, nigga fuck 50 Cent
I heard Tony Yayo can't pay the rent
I heard Lloyd Banks can't pay the rent
I beat the G-Unit out of 40 Glocc
Sue me for forty grand, that same forty will get you shot
IPhone in my hand doing the forty whop
That nigga looked up and thought he saw 40 Pacs
Looking out of my window I see forty cops
Trying to serve me that subpoena, I'm on this Xbox
2 Chainz voice, smoking that Wiz Khalifa
Pass to Waka Flocka, let me spit this ether
Yeah let me spit this ether
Yeah yeah yeah, 'til it blow the speaker
From eating Reese's Pieces to pulling guns out
For that Little Caesar's Pizza
All the way to jacking niggas for their Jesus pieces
I'm God to you bitch ass niggas put that on Matthew, Paul and Peter

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, nigga you stuck with me
Forever and ever and ever
Shyne Po ain't rich, Shyne po'
All the way in Belize with Kendrick's dick in his throat
Good kid, mad city, mad kid, bad city
Nothing from Compton could ever be trash
You hear that nigga voice sound like a dick in his ass
He reminiscing, a Compton nigga's bitch in prison
Used to be Christian, now that nigga Jew
Can't step foot in America so what he gon' do
P.Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through
Hood pass revoked, get your fucking brains blew
Blood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru
Soon as they killed Biggie that man became you
But you couldn't become him cause you were shooting at the roof

[Hook]

[Outro]
I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
I said I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
Let that bitch breathe, let that bitch breathe
This my motherfucking city
Five motherfucking albums
The Documentary, classic
Doctor's Advocate, classic
Everything in between that shit and Jesus piece, classic
Them mufuckin grams, [?]
Chop it up, rock it up
Do whatever the fuck you gotta do to get yo muthafuckin paper
Shoutout to my nigga Dr. Dre
He ain't ever gotta put out Detox, now that he got me and fucking Kendrick
And them muthafuckin Dre Beats you got on yo muthafuckin head
That nigga made a billion dollars off a muthafuckin headphone
Mad kid, bad city, yea
