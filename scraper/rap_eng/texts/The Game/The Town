[Verse 1 - The Game]
Back on the block nigga, chains on the rocks nigga
Used to move yay, I should throw up the Roc nigga
Back with the Doc, so I just throw up the 'Math
Eight, two fingers down, get the ski mask
This is body bag shit, that open the bag spliff
Coke in your lung, a muthafuckin monster is what I've become
Bars hotter than Pablo Escobar's stove
Got the Venice Queensbridge Escobar flow, so
Brat! Brat! Brat!
50 rounds'll knock you niggas down, Ben Affleck from The Town This is my town nigga. King, mayor, all that
Niggas better fall back or bullets in your gallbladder
P-U-S-S-Y: that's what I call cats
Hardcore, die today if it brought Biggie Smalls back
Eyes low, 7 5/8, Black Wall hat
R.E.D. Album, bitch, everything else all black
Eyes low, 7 5/8, Black Wall hat
R.E.D. Album, nigga, everything else all black

[Hook]
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down
Gun 'em down, get a hundred rounds from me

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Niggas better break bread and niggas better play dead
I step in front of the beam and take it off of Dre head
Everything's straight red: my bitch, my car, the tip of my cigar
My Philly hat, my scarf
Y'all niggas pushing light weight
Bryon Russell ass niggas falling down, tryna put a hand up in Mike face
The fucking booth is in danger, ain't a mic safe
Mike Bibby, Mike Vick, nigga, Mike Jake
4th album, cause I do my shit the right way
And like Dre the fans gon wait, so have a nice day
I'mma have a nice bitch sitting in the white 6
Coldest rapper alive: I write with a ice pick
And I write sick, meaning that my bars ill
Fuck the world up, nigga, I'm a oil spill
In the 4-wheel, paint job orange peel
Not like Picasso bitch, but I draw steel

[Hook]
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down
Gun 'em down, get a hundred rounds from me

[Verse 3 - The Game]
I ain't never gave no fuck, why would I start now?
Everytime I get on the track, it's black hawk down
I declare war, pullin' niggas' cards now
And I ain't gotta fuck Sarah Palin to lay the law down
Birds: knock em all down, you could push record now
Used to ball like Chris Paul, I'm John Wall now
Still bang Dogg Pound, I don't like how y'all sound
Gun-butt a nigga in the grill, try to floss now
I set the bridge on fire, try to cross now
Still fuck Benzino, I don't care who run The Source now
I got magazines inside of magazines
Walk up, laid everybody on the porch down
Kill the drums cuz the track is a corpse now
Spread my fingers when I shoot, Kyle Watson, Georgetown
Think it's a movie then its A.I, Georgetown
But if it ain't a court 'round, I'm bustin' with the 4 pound

[Hook]
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
Yeah I run 'em down, they wanted now
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They don't run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing, I hunt 'em down
Gun 'em down, get a hundred rounds from me
