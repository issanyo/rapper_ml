[Hook: Game]
I'm out of this world
I'm a shooting star
Come through in the foreign cars, they like (Hey, hey)
You can't live with me
But you would die without me
So put your hands in the sky like (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1: Game]
'05, I battled Kanye at NikeTown
Felt like Lil' Boosie, bitches had to wipe me down
And you can ask 'Ye
Better yet, ask Dre
He was right there to celebrate like (Hey, hey)
A couple platinum plaques, a couple cars later
I had to black out, yeah Darth Vader
White Panamera, red Asantis
The bitch ridin' shotgun, blow like Ashanti
I fucked all the hoes, stayed in 5 star tellies'
Gettin' head from Vida, while I was watchin' Belly
Put it in the mouth like Akinyele
What can I say? I get around, Makaveli
