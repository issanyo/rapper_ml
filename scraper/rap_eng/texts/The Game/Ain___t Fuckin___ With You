[Intro]
That T.M. shit, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit Game!

[Hook : LeMarvin & (Game)]
I don't care that you lookin' like Beyoncé on her best day
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)

[Verse 1 : The Game]
I'm tired of playin' your games, you pissin' me off
I'm watchin' LeBron so holla when this shit go off
You say I be trippin' but really it's you that be gone
Always bringin' up Tanisha be givin' me dome
I ain't tryin' to hear that, I'm just tryin' to chill
So chill, like Chamillionaire or Mike Jones grill
All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans
Dancin' like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50
Tryin' to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out
Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse
We used to hit midtown, throwin' all them stacks out
Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out
Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out
You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin' to act out
Flippin' like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house
Black out

[Hook : LeMarvin & (Game)]
I don't care that you lookin' like Beyoncé on her best day
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)

[Verse 2 : The Game]
Bitch, I'm rollin' 21's and over
Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover
My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet
And that line was fly, bitch I'm a lear jet

[Hook : LeMarvin & (Game)]
I don't care that you lookin' like Beyoncé on her best day
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)

[Verse 3 : The Game]
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'!
Stop playin' girl, stop playin'
I said stop playin', you better stop playin'
'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that
Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back
Cause that's what we do, when girls be with the chit-chat
Every mornin' on "The View", them girls be with the chit-chat
Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk
I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk
But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off
Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought
For real

[Hook : LeMarvin & (Game)]
I don't care that you lookin' like Beyoncé on her best day
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin' wit'chu)

[Outro]
That T.M. shit, uh-huh, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit Game!
