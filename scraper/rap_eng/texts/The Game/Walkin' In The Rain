Eastwood:
(westcoast stand up)
Yo yo size 12 Converse throught the back door
And a Dodgers hat to me is what the Yankees is to Fat Joe
Real low cacky stayed pierced up
It has been that way since B.street (what)
Hood niggas need ?? to block shots
But young East the beast will make the .45 pop lock
Do the snake on them
I blow out his candles and spill the whole birthday cake on them
Ain't nothing fake homy
This is classical music and I'm the Los Angelas Beethoven
And the wait is over
M.O.B is gonna bang cuz Game is the crack
This ain't ova

Technic:
Sitting in a hoving tank
No shoe strings or belt
Hit up The Game
Mayne I need all ya help
Out on bail
Soon as my Chucks hits the payvement
Touch my bucks and leave the whole world in amazement
Call the voice creazed up
Name on the back left
Throwing up the DC
Since niggas want act deaf
Banging nothing but the .38 untill he back fresh
Dieing for nothing living for everything
On the blacktef
And its a mess
When the 44 hits ya brains
Send a lil homie get ya chain
M.O.B
Yeah fuck the clique ya claim
From N.Y.C. to C.P.T
This L.B.C

Eastwood:
Blood in Blood out
Tell the Crips to stay locing
Them niggas doing time in the piern remain focused
The WestCoast was sleeping
The Game woke him
Its a hard knock live
Yeah Word to Jay Hova
The flow is straight jolla
Fuck your payrolla
This hennesy making it harder to stay sofa(?)
When from gray skies to pushing the grey Rover
Hes pushin up flowers at the 38 foldem
Like it or not I might pop at the cops
As long as i make it home before the album drops
Technic
Yeah and its the gunnerman
Its the 500 grand
And I dont want to talk what we did at Summerjam (damn)
