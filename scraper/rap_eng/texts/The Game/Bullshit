[Intro: The Game]
Ay who got all these niggas walking around
With all this motherfuckin' air in they chest?
Oh, you pumpin' your motherfucking self up, huh?

[Hook]
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit

[Verse 1: The Game]
Pull up, park the Camaro like an arrow
Only fuck with Snoop, nigga fuck your cousin Harold
Plus I got the barrel on tuck, nigga what
First nigga jump up, first nigga fucked up
I'm with the bullshit, Jimmy Butler in the Kutlas
Hop out, get yo ass beaten, no mustard
Hood full of killers, Cedar Block, no busters
Say we gon' do it, but we ain't, don't trust us
Get your ass robbed out here
By a nigga name Rob out here with no job out here
We with the bullshit, Burgundy sob out here
Get smoked if ever say slob out here
Nigga this Piru, I'm advertising like a commercial
Hand me your hood pass, pat you down then murk you
Nigga we still mad Doughboy killed Virgil
Blood this ain't no motherfuckin' movie

[Hook]
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit

[Verse: 2]
40 days, 40 nights
If I ever lose a muthafuckin' fight
You in the pen', say good night
Get your ass strangled with the motherfuckin' kite
I am with the bullshit, save them motherfuckin' tears
You bunk down with the nigga that ain't had pussy in years
He with the bullshit, fuck you gon' go?
Nigga where the fuck you gon' go when he made you his hoe
Now you switchin' in the pen
Through the glass talking to your mama, bitchin in the pen'
Ohh you snitchin' in the pen?
Your lawyer stuck you on the pen', nigga just stick you in the pen' (ohh)
My nigga Reek doing 30
And I got gun that he did murder with, it's still dirty
And I heard from a little birdy, niggas wanna problems
Jump in my Impala, skrrt!

[Hook]
You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit
