[Verse 1]
I got these freak hoes clappin' their hands, stompin' their feet
Every now and then they put their mouth on me
But these days a G like me can't even call it
They ride dick until you sleep and then go through your wallet
Fake ass, bitch ass, thot ass, slut ass hoes
Workin' in secret Sunday, don't even wipe that pole
Dirty bitch, you done had a dick in every one of your holes
You a trick, you ain't shit and everybody knows
Bitch you don't even wash your rag
Let a nigga smash and you don't even wash your ass
Fuck you mean? You 'bout to go home and take a shower
That mean that pussy 'bout to be funky for a whole 'nother hour
Every night you let a new nigga nut in your shit
How you suck a nigga's dick with that cut on your lip?
You freak bitch, your baby daddy in the county doin' burpies
And you gave that nigga herpes

[Hook]
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit

[Verse 2]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and sluts
She asked to hold 500, I let her hold deez nuts
Bitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps
Talkin' bout eat these groceries, bitch you on food stamps
You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother, he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunnaz
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jungles
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick
I hit her with a hashtag like (Bitch you ain't shit)

[Hook]
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
