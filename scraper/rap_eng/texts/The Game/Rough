[Game: Verse 1]
What do you do when life gets too hard for you
Shed tears or is that to hard for you
I’m just a man, reflection of my family
Meaning you ain’t gotta have one to understand me
I got kids, I got friends
Only difference between me and you is I don’t care bout this benz
I care about Will he was dying and he needed me
I care about the Grammy they gave Missy they cheated me
But they cheated Drake, they cheated Justin Bieber
Guess America don’t like Canada we some fuckin heathens
Game can’t watch his mouth thats why his daddy beat him
Same mouth made him millions and now his daddy need him
Finally got a black president look at how they treat him
Kids starvin in Africa why only Oprah feed them?
What happened to the music that I know
I miss it, you too, I guess we feel like Bono

[Hook]
Is it my fault, cause I tried?
Gave it my all. Hip Hop died
Where do we go now, when it's over?
I'm lookin' all around
Can this be, the aftermath?

[Game: Verse 2]
The living, the dead
These Dre beats, my head
My life, featuring Wayne
That was Jayceon, this is Game
Adjacent to the fame ain't chasing a damn thing
So tonight let all of your pain be champagne
I can't tame my killers but I can tell them chill
I might give you a pass depending how I feel
The bi polar bear
They said the end of the world is coming, I know it’s here
Cuz California cold this year
Detox, R.E.D
MC’s dead
Kill them softly like Lauren Hill
Skin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel
We all born to die, some of us born to kill
If that don’t wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will

[Hook]

[Yelawolf: Verse 3]
Never I thought I’d see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot
And have people coming up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about
Yela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just can’t wait
Congrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?
I told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph it’s cool
Got fans gettin inked up, dedicated to me I love you too
Got 3000 sold, the spirit of rock and roll
Long barrel .38 loaded I’m John Wayne in Geronimo
So I dont really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball
Cuz I never done shit but get better and believing in God
And leaving my mom at 15 with a dream and a cross
A cross that I didn’t see until I was nailed to it for believing at all
That I could ever be accepted the way that I saw it
I mean I knew it would be hard, but really come on y'all
Oh I’m a redneck? FUCK YOU tatted on my neck
I’ll sip high life in a can at the Grammys now add that to my rep
Bitch!

[Hook]
