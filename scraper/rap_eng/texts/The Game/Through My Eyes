[Verse 1]
Life ain't fair and sometimes it get black
Like the Nike Airs and that's when I go back
Back Where? to the block where the dreams never stop
Cause its hard to dream when your dream was being on top
And you already there..so you look down into the City and see
Life ain't what it used to be
Kids fantasize about how a Phantom rides
If you attract a star then welcome to the enterprise
Hop in a spaceship and fly..fly away
Pass the clouds where Marvin Gaye and 2Pac stay
And never wanna come back like Jam Master Jay
Matter fact, close your eyes and just pass away

[Hook]
If you could see straight through my eyes
If I left this world tomorrow and say goodbye
If you could take one thing with you what would it be?
Oooh If you, could be, with me

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't be hearing this if it wasn't for Lupe
He inspired what I wrote bought his album today
Then I threw it in my car and let the CD play
You are a Superstar is what the CD say
And on the eve of this morning I'm like Stevie J
Making love to the music like when Stevie play
When I rap the hood listen
Ghetto T.D. Jakes
And the Devil tried hard just to see me break
That's when I switch switch cars and I cross my heart
Knowing that I'm God's Son like the belly of Nas
I used to dream hard about being in Belly with Nas
Even the ghetto Mozart couldn't play that part
Like the Eli Manning's when they play that hard
Everybody ain't a Giant but they play that card
And that card is dealt and then blows
Are felt, like a Mayweather jab that lands below the belt..Yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Light a candle in the dark and lead yourself to the light
And when you there blow it out so you can sleep through the night
The Sun rise in the morning and your future get bright
Bright as the ice in my ear its like a movie premiere
And you can be Denzel here's your Oscar tip
If you can memorize your lines without reading the script
Then you can walk through the forest while you standing still
You might get lucky like Forrest 20 million a film
And with that, you can buy yourself a football field
Build a field of dreams for kids who got that skill
Marry a legend like Jada did if you got that Will
But laugh now cry later if you pop that pill
Seemed fun for a moment but it's not that real
Cause your life is ice cold and you got that chill
So tomorrow when wake and you spin that wheel
Just remember what I told you from on top that hill
Its real
