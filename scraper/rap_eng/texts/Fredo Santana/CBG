[Verse: Baby CEO]
I came a long way, from fightin in the day
CEO that be my name, grab that chopper let it bang
Got goons in the cut, and you know they don't play
Choppin off your legs and feed 'em to your head, to your brain
CBG that be the gang, the Savage Squad what I bang
Talkin down on the gang, then you wan' lay 'round here
Pussy nigga give it up, 'fore I let the .30 bust
Skeet, skeet, bang, bang, grab the chopper let it nut
I'm comin through the back, but the goons pullin' up
Got shooters on go, and they poppin out the cut
Ma all I do is win, I ain't never givin up
Runnin' to the fuckin paper, my nigga really tired as fuck
I'm stuntin on you niggas, cause you niggas fake as fuck
I came from the trenches now I'm gettin big bucks
The hoes ain't want me, now they want me cause I'm up
Word, everybody worried CEO is fucked up
I came a long way, It's time to get payed
