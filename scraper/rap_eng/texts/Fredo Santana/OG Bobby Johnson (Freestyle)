[Hook]
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Hanging with BDs in Chiraq
Chopper on the side where the couch at
I ain't gotta talk cause I'm 'bout that
OG Bobby Johnson
OG Bobby Johnson
OG Bobby Johnson
OG Bobby Johnson

[Verse 1]
If it's beef then nigga where your house at?
I don't need rap, where my trap at?
You ain't really game, you just rap that
Put money on your head like a snapback
Give Juice my gun, gone blast that
Clown-ass nigga I just laugh at
Looking like a lick, where my mask at?
"Fredo 'bout that life?" You gotta ask that?
Come to my hood, where your pass at?
You wifed that bitch and I smashed that?
Money good, plug don't count that
Got 30 shots with me, better count that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Come on Front Street, that's where I boss at
Aim at your head where my cross at
Whoop a nigga dead, don't care what it cost me
You ain't talking money, goddamn, you lost me
Pull up high in your driveway
Chopper, let that bitch go sideways
The nigga died on a Monday
Should have paid my ass on a Sunday
Shoot a nigga like a runway
Got the beam on the 30, can't run away
Chopper get to spraying, nigga, andale
I'm a kill his ass, that's what folk say

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sneak diss Twitter beef miss me
Got a 30, got a 40, got a 50
I'm a pull up on your block
Juice, D-Rose coming with me
Kidnap a nigga, now he history
Kill everybody, don't leave no witness
Got a chopper and a semi
Dare a nigga think I'm pretending (On Dave)
