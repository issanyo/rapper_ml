[Intro]
Get out of here, you dago bastard !
Go on, get your ass out of here !
*Rifle shots fire*

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A big K, a big K
I just went and bought a big K
Shoot a nigga dead in his face
I ain't ever like him anyway
It's gon' be okay, it's gon' be okay
I sip lean, I don't like no Rosé
I just buy 'em for my whole gang
Baby you know we the Glo Gang

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
2-4-14 be the gang
Big boss, put a goofy in his place
Got 30's hangin' off my fuckin' waist
Don't make me catch a mothafuckin' case
He owe gwap then that nigga better pay
Or I'mma be at his crib the next day
With a big K, a big K
Shoot his momma in the mothafuckin' face
In the trap, whippin' work like a slave
In the hood, my lil' niggas can't behave
Chest shot, or the neck, or the face
Put an opp nigga in his fuckin' grave
A big K, a big K
Sosa say he want him dead, he die today
Got a 30, I just bought a big K
It's ok, it's ok

[Hook]
A big K, a big K
I just went and bought a big K
Shoot a nigga dead in his face
I ain't ever like him anyway
It's gon' be okay, it's gon' be okay
I sip lean, I don't like no Rosé
I just buy 'em for my whole gang
Baby you know we the Glo Gang


[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Sneak dissin', get found the next day
Stretched out, bullet holes from my K
It ain't my birthday, but I got a lot of cake
Try to take it and I'm shootin' you in the face
In the trap, with the squad, movin' weight
White bitches sniff a raw up off the plate
I don't trust niggas, lot of niggas fake
When I'm on your ass, ain't no escape
Try to run, I ain't worried, bullets chase
I just went and bought a big K
It's ok, it's ok
I just went and bought a big K

[Hook]
A big K, a big K
I just went and bought a big K
Shoot a nigga dead in his face
I ain't ever like him anyway
It's gon' be okay, it's gon' be okay
I sip lean, I don't like no Rosé
I just buy 'em for my whole gang
Baby you know we the Glo Gang
