[Hook]
I grew up around some trap spots
Coming in make sure them doors locked
This my spot
Try to rob and get shot
Them fiends cop
Know it's money when them doors knock
Stove top, two birds cooked in one pot
Red dots, 30 shots and black Glocks
The hood hot move a spot to a new spot
The same block, different crib with a cash spot
I got it late night around half dots

[Verse 1: Gino Marley]
I grew up around some trap spots
Early mornings, late nights wit' it
Couldn't sleep I had to fight wit' it
In a trap that had mice in it
Plug steady price shifting
In the kitchen, white whippin'
Flipped, it was the right prism
Whole team hands on yeah we love cake
Can't sit around and wait so we paper chase
Wasn't ever given shit so we trap to make
And since they ain't givin and we quick to take
Taking trips over East, meets by the lake
I give him cash he give me bags then we split our ways
Trap spot shit bitch I'm in the trap for days
I'm in the hood, cash spot just a block away
Stay strapped you better play it safe
Guard the money with my life so I'm shootin' if you try to take
Trap spot shit bitch I'm in the trap for days
I guard the money with my life, I shoot you try to take

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Real street nigga I was born in a trap spot
Mixin' dope, baggin' rocks in a trap spot
Gino got the Glocks so we don't keep this door locked
Gotta watch these faces, some of these niggas be cops
Tried to buy work but really taking snapshots
I swear I keep a mask on when I'm in the trap spot
Try to rob me and I'm giving out face shots
The trap still open even when the janks hot
Couple months switch houses, I don't do the same spot
Eating noodles, cookin' dope, damn in the same pot
1st of the month, holiday if you trappin' hard
You gotta be smart and you gotta have heart
Keep a gun when it's dark
Run up on me let it spark
See this trap life shit man you bound to be a felon
If you ain't talkin' money you can't fit up in my schedule
I let my money talk but put this pistol to yo' temple

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ballout]
I grew up in a trap house
One stove, four pots
Cook a whole thing until it turn rock
Some prefer it in the microwave, I prefer a pot
I'll buy a whole brick nigga I prefer a lot
300 is the team bitch and we run the blocks
We'll run up in ya' spot, lay it down, take the blocks
I'm doing BD till' I drop
Countin' guap, totin' jops
From ya' bitch I want top
Ridin' around foreign drops
Bitch catch me if you can
Took with me, you get shot
We don't play, you'll get popped
I'm out here on the block
Niggas lyin' man they not
I can't trust em' swear they cops
Snitch on me, you get shot
Man down, fuck the opps
300 is the mob and we some young trap stars
300, O-Block, we be trappin' nonstop
We be gettin' it round' the clock
We be all on the block
In the store, in a alley, tryin' to get it round' the clock

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Blood Money]
I just went off on my connect
Quarter milli off on his neck
Flexin' like he won a lottery check
Bitch gon' give me respect
7:30 my way or get the tec
Kill a nigga for nothin' but the set
Northside cat, 2012 vet
Exotic packs
Red bone wife, red bottoms and all that
What's next?
Peel a minivan all black
Mask up, make sure we all strapped
Now we finna limp
Lights out, savage you better ramp
Cause' when it come to surveillance you a champ
We gon' have to vamp
Sosa say he got one hell of a camp
Give me a molly, a blunt and I'm amp
8 balls going for $150
Straight drop, come fuck with me
High speed, super dirty doing 160
Big gun with me, cause' I ain't going back
I got a 40, a scale, and 5 zips of crack
