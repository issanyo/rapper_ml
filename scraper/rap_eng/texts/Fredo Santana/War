[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
First nigga gettin' tough, gettin' trunk
I got that 30 in my pocket, wassup
300 swoll in the club, get stomped
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't lettin' up
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up
Grab a choppa, grab a tech, grab erythang
Kill erythang. On erythang
Yeah them 30s and them Glocks, yeah we tote those
Fufu ass niggas, we expose those
Call my lil' niggas up about a stain tho
Sit down, plot about it, then we take it down
Anybody move, or make sound
Couple bodies drop, from them choppa rounds
Everyday is Halloween, I got my mask out
All my niggas savages don't make a spazz out
Tadoe on it and he got the fuckin' 40 on ‘em
If a nigga want beef I send my shorties on em
Yeah that life bitch, I'mma bout that
Catch a nigga snoozing, push his cap back
Yeah that life bitch, I'mma bout that

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
First nigga gettin' tough, gettin' trunk
I got that 30 in my pocket, wassup
300 swoll in the club, get stomped
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't lettin' up
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up

[Verse 3 : Gino Marley]
Group a wild niggas blood hound niggas
When it comes to stains we take down niggas
Ki's and pounds nigga hit the ground nigga
Let 30 shots go, call that shit a crowd clearer
Lots a loud innas foreign cars in ‘em
We sum' bread winnas so we some band spendas
Open all doors bitch let the squad enter
And we share hoes bitch let the squad hit ya
Money over all no ops in this mob nigga
Put money on yo' squad that’s a group a dead niggas
And all we do is win ain't lose innas
And we stay turnt up we ain’t no cool niggas
Keep the tool when we move never snooze nigga
Couple shots to ya body try to move nigga
Time is money and we own money all the time
War is nutten nigga we can war at any time

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]

Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
Don’t nan nigga, want war with us
A couple shots gettin' fired, we ain't letting up
