Change, nothin' ever stays the same
People change, money change
Change, nothin' ever stay the same
People change, money change
Change, nothin' ever stay the same
Nothin' ever stay the same, nothin' ever stay the same
Nothin' ever stay the same, nothin' ever stay the same

[Verse 1: Lil' Reese]
I'm Reese so how could I change?
Play with my niggas, you can change
I could not switch up for no change
I seen nigga really change
But me? I'm still the fuckin' same
Play with me, I'mma go insane
I got 30's up on everything
That mean my gun they got them things
I'm still up on the same block
Play with my killas you get popped
Play with the squad you get dropped
Show no love for a fuckin' op
For my op bitch, I want top
And when I shoot, I aim for top
So I can see the body drop, so I can see the body drop

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
All this money out here and I swear I need all of it
Niggas fake as fuck but foolin Fredo? I can't fall for it
Niggas say they ride, but will they really ride?
Sayin' 300k shit, that's just suicide
I done see a lot of niggas freeze up when it's that time
I done see a lot of niggas snitch ain't wanna do no time
I remember cold nights, broke as fuck, ain't had a dime
Lost a lot of guys, sometimes I wanna press rewind, press rewind
Somtimes wanna press rewind
Thinkin' 'bout it right now, wanna grab my nine
Grab my nine, grab my nine
Let me see a op and then I blow him down
These bitches come and go so I can't wife no bitch
Ain't shit change, I'm on that same shit
A lot of niggas switch when I got famous
But I will never change over fame shit
