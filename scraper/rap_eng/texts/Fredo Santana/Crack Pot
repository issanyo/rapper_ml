[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Lotta money made off this crack pot
Every trap I worked at made that bitch hot
Work be gone soon as I cop
Don’t come with short money, get rerock
Lotta money made off this crack pot
Lotta money made off this crack pot
Come with straight money get straight drop
Lotta money made off this crack pot

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
When I first turned 12 I started selling crack
Went from being a lookout to pushing packs
Looking like a goofy, you gon' get taxed
Looking like you wan’t beef, I can get you whacked
Hollow tips, hollow tips
Try to run from them hollow tips we shoot your mama crib
Drama ish, show your ass what drama is
Tie your whole family up ’til you show us where them commas is
Pussy nigga I swim where piranhas live
Take your bitch out on some Benihana shit
Liked the bitch so much I let folks nem run the bitch
But catch me in the trap counting hundreds cooling, running shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Boss Top]
All the junkies know about this trap spot
Lot of money made out this crack pot
Lot of bands pushed out this trap spot
Selling loud, selling heroin out this trap spot
Bought a lot of foreigns from this trap spot
Run up on me 30s blowing from the trap spot
Fredo, he grew up in the trap spot
Hit the horn ‘cause we got it in the trap spot
Got burglar barred doors on the trap spot
3 microwaves, 6 stoves in the trap spot
You know we keep some hoes in the trap spot
This money super long out this trap spot

[Hook]
