Woke up this morning, I turned on my splash though
New condo, new rolex, turned on my swag though
Gonna fuck your bitch and I might not bring her back though
And I only fucked once, cause I am an asshole
Traphouse, gangster, I keep all these racks
Nigga play, trust me, he gon’ get whacked homie
Niggas broke as fuck, nigga I just splash on em
I ain't worried bout y'all, nigga I just splash on em

[Verse 1 – Casino]
I poured me an eighth in the two liter, that mud
I’m splashing all my sprite, I splash it with the molly
Had me on another level, good god I’m naughty
Had me thinking I can be [?], I know karate
Splashing in a two door, pull out rari bitch, I’m gone
Dropped a Cuban round my neck, [?] that I call it splash
I got football pads in my pocket, I call it splash
We blowing on so much gas me and you gon’ need a gas mask

[Hook]
Woke up this morning, I turned on my splash ho
New condo, new rolex, turned on my swag ho
Gonna fuck your bitch and I might not bring her back though
And I only fucked once, cause I am an asshole
Traphouse, gangster, I keep all these racks
Nigga play, trust me, he gon’ get whacked homie
Niggas broke as fuck, nigga I just splash on em
I ain't worried bout y'all, nigga I just splash on em

[Verse 2 – Fredo Santana]
New condo, new bitch, damn I just splash on em
Pockets got jumped on, cause they keep knots on em
Try to rob me, better know some shots coming
Looking in the mirror like it feels good to be on the top, don’t it
Heard you got that good gas, if it’s OG I need five of them
Fucked your bitch one time but I can’t spend no time with her
Woke up with like five bitches, told my nigga like five million
I know that head good, she gotta let the squad hit

[Hook]
Woke up this morning, I turned on my splash though
New condo, new rolex, turned on my swag though
Gonna fuck your bitch and I might not bring her back though
And I only fucked once, cause I am an asshole
Traphouse, gangster, I keep all these I keep all these racks
Nigga play, trust me, he gon’ get whacked homie
Niggas broke as fuck, nigga I just splash on em
