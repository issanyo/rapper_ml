[Snippet: Fredo Santana]

Heard he got them bricks, duck tape his family
Niggas they be acting, what you want, a Grammy?
Niggas they be bitches, what they got on, panties?
Up this 30, shoot his grandpa and his nanny!

[Intro: RondoNumbaNine]

Trap spot!
Trap spot!
Trap spot!
Trap spot!
Trap spot!
Trap spot!

[Hook: RondoNumbaNine]

30's in that trap spot, savages too
Macs on the table, so better be cool
Drugs in the fridge, pills in the jar
Catch me low key, not even far
Riding through Chiraq in a foreign car
Bitches on my dick, I'm a young star
Try to try me team, you ain't gon' make it far
Them Six Double Owe boys ready for war
Them OTF boys ready for war
A lot of fucking savages in the trap spot
Moving on that work, trynna' get a knot

[Verse 1: RondoNumbaNine]

Catch me low key, not even far
Posted on Steve Drive, I'm a young star
Trap spot got SK's in it, trap got AK's in it
Jug, finesse, back to the trap, I do this shit, this shit not rap
My niggas in that trap spot, smoking dope with a big jock
With a couple thots trynna' give us top
With a couple thots trynna' do the squad
In the trap spot we servin' pills
If them jakes come, then it get real
We gon' get away, that's not the deal
Ya hear me?
Leave out the black, hop in that black truck
We outta' here, load the money up
You a lame, you act like it's funny, bruh
See I'm 600, we do a lotta' savage stuff
I'm tired of these fakers, I'm tired of these niggas talking to the jakes
But my niggas still beat the case
I'm eating shit, I should say my grace
And bitch I'm coolin' where it ain't safe
Pussy boy stay in yo' place
Before I make this Mac destroy your race

Bitch I'm a savage and that's how I'm living
Same bitch you wifing, kissing, suck my children
Welcome to my trap spot, trapping out them buildings
I been getting money since the fucking lil' one
Got 30's and savages in the trap spot
When you leave out, make sure that door locked
I been seeing police, man this trap hot
We got too many guns, put them in another trap spot!
