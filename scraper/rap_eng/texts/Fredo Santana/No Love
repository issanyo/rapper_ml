Show no love at all

Show no love at all

I'm in the jungle dog jungle dog

Where its poppin' off poppin' off

Show no love at all

Show no love at all

I'm in the jungle dog 300 y'all

Where it's poppin' off like 'blapada'

[Verse 1: Chaboki]

This is VWAHLA dog

Where it's poppin' off

Poppin' off

Never actin' soft

Show no love at all

Show no love at all

Try to stop me dog

We get to 'blapada'

Them Stacks are tall

Stacks are tall

You know we at the mall

You know we have to ball

I'm in a Jaguar dog

With a model broad

Top off

Just to top it off

No one higher than me

So it's church when we here

No one higher than me

So it's merk when we here

Girls flirt when we here

Twerk when we here

No shirts when we here

Blowin' purp in the air

Like what

Middle fingers to the law

You know I turn up with my squad

Do it raw

Cause they know who we are

I'm with a thot

Leanin hard

Rollin' up in the car

Do it hard

They lookin hard

Cause they know who we are

I'm with a thot

Leanin hard

Rollin' up in the car

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]

Never show no love to no dumb ass bitch

I be counting hundreds thumbing through that shit

Damn GBE they dumb ass rich

Got a lot of money but we still hit licks

I could pay a nigga but I rather do the hit

Got experience with them guns

You know I'm with the shits

In the trap off my phone I just sold bout a brick

Call up my plug shit I need about six

Got this jewelry on my wrist... Thanks to my wrist

Just bought a new whip... Thanks to my wrist

In the kitchen with them pots

Water whip that shit

Fucked your girl one time

Then I forget that bitch
