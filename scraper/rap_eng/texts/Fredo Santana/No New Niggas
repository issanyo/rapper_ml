[Hook: Fredo Santana]
No new niggas in my ass, we don’t fuck with strangers
Pull ‘em pistols out and just get to aiming!
My ‘lil niggas dangerous found out on probation
But still totting ‘em bangers, we leave you brainless!
We love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it, their money, I'm chasing!
I'm counting new faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!

[Verse 1:Ballout]
I'm counting ‘em faces, I'm shooting ‘em faces
Capture us overseas, I don't do the same places, no!
Switch up the location, while the guys are on payments
No, I am not on papers, Ballout just handle cables (Ballout)!
Free cables, we do cables, no Ballout don't do favors (no)
I smoke your body facing untiI can't taste it!
They ain't real, they're faking, 300, we're them mayors
O'block affiliated got all these niggas hating!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
I’m chasing that paper, you got it, I take it
On the block with the gangs, my trap going so crazy
These niggas my sons, I call on my babies
Take 9s, 3/80s, 2/2, I let you taste it!
Here goes my favorite, I love fucking their faces
I do it so major! What? I'm counting that paper!
My finger is aching, I'm counting that paper!
I'm balling like the pesos, these niggas is bitches
I tell them to their faces!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gino Marley]
That money, I chase it, impatient, no waiting
I dump through their faces, no masses, got faces
I drive cars like speed racer, fuck bitches that be famous
We cash my occupation, I spend it and save it
My pants just full of Franklins, bad bitches learn the basic
Money toss all, I'm thinking, drown round in that Lincoln
Sip Lean so I've been drinking, that molly got her spacing
My foreign plug Jamaican I chase it, no waiting!

[Hook]
