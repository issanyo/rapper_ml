[Intro]
Niggas hide in the crib when the heat home (they scared)
I'm high as fuck, aye, Bezzle throw a beat on
I Can't Believe You Just Did That!

[Verse]
Whip, whip, all you hear is scrapes from the bowl (whip)
I've been trappin' all day with the same clothes (on)
I'm so GLO, shit, I can fuck yo' main hoe (I can)
Big bankrolls, rainbows, can't fold (it can't)
Try to rob, keep a pistol, man, I can't go (you know it)
Put some money on the judge, yeah, the case closed (fuck it)
Shoota's in the cut, kill when I say so (pow, pow)
Robbed my plug 'cause he was cocky with a ego (fuck)
I used the .40, I ain't even use the eagle (what)
Don't shoot from far, walk up so I can see close (what)
I'm Stevie Wonder, I swear to God I don't see you folks (I don't)
Niggas hide in the crib when the heat home (they scared)
I'm high as fuck, aye, Bezzle throw a beat on (haha)
Niggas be lame as fuck, damn, what they be on?
It's time to crash out, show 'em what the streets on
I'm Fredo Krueger, bitch, wrong nigga to sleep on (grrr)

[Chorus]
Who you think you fuckin' with? Whoa, not me
In the kitchen, catch me still off Hibachi (ding, dong)
Niggas talk but then they runnin' from them black Jeep's (where you goin'?)
My shoota's is my niggas so they get the block's cheep
Who you think you fuckin' with? Whoa, not me (big dawg)
In the kitchen, catch me still off Hibachi (whip, whip)
Niggas talk but then they runnin' from them black Jeep's (where you goin'?)
My niggas is my shoota's so they get the block's cheep

[Outro]
They my, uh, uh, uh, uh
I Can't Believe You Just Did That!
