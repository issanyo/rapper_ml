[Hook: Fredo Santana]

Micheal Jackson with the bricks
Moonwalk the work
Moonwalk the work
Moonwalk the work
The shit stepped on
The shit stepped on
The shit stepped on

[Verse: Reese Gardner]

If you ain't out grindin you ain't fuckin with me
You need some weed then hit my line I problly got what you need
I got a whole pound of tree full savers and swisher sweets
I almost fucked my hustle up I'm rolling up too much weed
Just like my designer clothes I keep that designer weed
I'm cutting off all my hoes cus mary jane all i need
I'm rocking my Thriller jacket while Fredo a bussin keyes
I gotta hop on my grind and play with a [?]
I might Versace my teeth
I always ride with the piece
You never felt the hollow tip then do not run up on me
And even if you catch me slipping I only got what I need
And I ain't worried bought the feds cus there ain't no catching me

[Hook]
