[Hook: Que & Fredo]
I got bad habits
Last month I blew a quarter, I got bad habits
Pourin' lean up like it's water, I got bad habits
All I hang around is killas, I got bad habits
All I wanna fuck is strippers
I got young nigga habits, young nigga habits. (x4)

[Verse One:Fredo Santana]

I got young nigga habit, young nigga habit, A-R 15
Couple bricks up in my mattress, I got young nigga habit, young nigga habit
Steady pourin' lean and i keep my automatic
I'm just a young livin savage, you can ask my nigga reese
Ridin in traffic, tryna do an op [?]
Police snatch me up, man, I ain't doin' no speakin'
[?] , boy I swear them niggas beezy
In the kitchen whippin' dope, i'm just smokin' on some keisha
Tote my pistol anywhere like that motherfucka legal, say you with the shit, but you talkin'
To the people. (foe don't wanna say he did and I ain't serve you either.)

[Verse Two: Lil Reese]

I got bad habits, smokin' kush, yeah, I got bad habits
If a nigga think he sweet, then he gotta habit
Getting fresh everyday, yeah, I got bad habits
On the block everyday, yeah, I got bad habits
Still with the same niggas, that's a bad habit
Still run the same blocks, that's a bad habit
Or you can catch me out in traffic, got the automatic
Don't run up on this car right here, man, it could get tragic
We out, All Night, 4 A.M. shit, we be slammed
My niggas, them my niggas, so you know, they bound to ride
Yo' niggas, them yo niggas, but them niggas, ain't gon' ride, say when it's war time most of them be bound to hide
