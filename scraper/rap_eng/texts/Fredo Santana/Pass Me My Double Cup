[Intro]
Pass me my double cup, where my double cup?
Where the fuck is my double cup?

[Hook]
So much money coming in, I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
Stressing like a motherfucka just pass me the double cup
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
Ain't hear what you talkin', pass me my double cup

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, roll me about four blunts
Brush my teeth, then I reach for my double cup
Bitch I reach for my double cup, call my shooters barbers cuz they'll line you up
All my niggas savage up, you don't want war with us
No goofy shit them rachets tucked
Goofy nigga actin' up, heard yo ass broke as fuck boy get yo trap up
Nigga tried to rob me, know I got my pistol tucked

[Hook]
So much money coming in, I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
Stressing like a motherfucka just pass me the double cup
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
Ain't hear what you talkin', pass me my double cup


[Verse 2]
I think them drugs kicked in
Coolin' with some bad bitches, finna pop some xans
Don't go no where without my bands
Now a days you can't even trust your own friends
Niggas snake, niggas fake
Shrimp and steak on my dinner plate
Middle fingers to the game
Promethazine and codeine got me drinking all this pain away

[Hook]
So much money coming in, I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
Stressing like a motherfucka just pass me the double cup
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
Ain't hear what you talkin', pass me my double cup
