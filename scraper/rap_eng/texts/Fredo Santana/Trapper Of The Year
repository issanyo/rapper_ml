[Hook]
Trapper of the year bitch I get em in and out
Plug just called say he pulled up to his house
Bricks everywhere bitch we ain't running out
Don't remember last time I saw a fucking drought
Get em in, and then I get em out (x3)
Trapper of the year that's what I'm about
Get em in, and then I get em out (x3)
Trapper of the year that without a doubt

[Verse 1]
Niggas snakes that's why I hang with no niggas
Damn, who the fuck raised some y'all niggas
Ya momma and ya daddy should be ashamed of you niggas
I really sold cocaine you just a lame ass nigga
Nigga reach for my chain I kill em
Niggas say they real, shit I don't feel em
Nigga try to rob me, shit wrong victim
Pow pow what you ain't know I had my pistol
Ain't shit sweet over here boy
Put that chopper to your ear boy
Ain't shit sweet over here boy
Put that chopper to your ear boy

Get em in, and then I get em out (x3)
Trapper of the year that without a doubt

[Verse 2]
I get money all day and you living off hope
I get money off the rap I get money off the dope
I could hit you up close, or I could go and get the scope
I'm a dirty savage dirty nigga go and get the soap
She pulled her pants down, but I only want her throat
Disrespect savage squad your ass gotta go
A couple of face shots, watch the bullets hit your nose
A couple passed out got my block hot for blows
Just whipped a whole brick watch the pots on the stove
Your bitch up on my dick cause my watch cold and froze
These niggas say they savage, but they really be hoes
Pull out the chopper watch these niggas get exposed

Trapper of the year that's what I'm about
Get em in, and then I get em out (x3)
