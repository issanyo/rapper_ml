Life I live make ya nervous (make ya nervous)
I say this life I live will make ya nervous (make ya nervous)
Young trap nigga still servin (still servin)
You's a pussy ass nigga and you know it  (and you know it nigga)
Let that gun in ya hand ain't gon blow shit (ain't gon blow shit)
Check my resume I never told shit (never told shit)
Call yourself a trapper you ain't sold shit

[Verse 1]
Wanna hold some money nigga hold this
Savage Squad Records I'm on my own dick (Squad Shit)
When I'm fresh I need to peak the whole film (You see me man)
Flexin' with your new girl that's my old bitch (old news)
Let's get rich or some (Ay)
Cops on bricks or some
Got your girl in the back sucking dick for fun (uhh)
Keep that Tommy close
Know I keep a gun (whaa?)
Ain't shit sweet
I am not the one
I'm gloed up my pole up
Racks on me I roll up
For Big Glo I torch you up
Drink on me I pour it up
I'm leanin' I'm leanin
Fuck you bitch my team lit
Heard a nigga got killed
No I ain't seen shit

[Verse 2]
I'm a front street general, front street sargeant
Talk to me with respect bitch
Talk to me with caution
Point me to the booth or trap shit
I'ma eat regardless
Pull up on front street (damn you ass done lost it)
Got that 50 rounds on my neck or sum' (45)
Got 100 rounds put it on my stick or some (AK)
Guns never rusty fuck you think I'm in it for?
Get your ass whacked pull up on my strip or some
In Cali on jet-ski's wish a nigga test me
Sippin' lean and smoking weed
Know I got that Tec with me
I'm ballin I'm ballin
But I don't shoot no free throws
Heard a nigga want beef
Know I'm giving free smoke
