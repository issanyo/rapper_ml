[Intro: Fredo Santana]
Trap life, Trap life fuck everybody for now on
Don't call my phone unless you trynna buy a whole brick

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Out here on the grind wanna come up
Ain't gone tell you twice, I'mma tell you once (once)
I can introduce you to this trap life (trap life)
I can introduce you to this trap life (trap life)
Wanna sell hard wanna be a star (star)
Wanna fuck bitches wanna drive cars (foreign)
I can introduce you to this trap life (trap life)
I can introduce you to this trap life (trap life)

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
I can introduce you to this trap life
In my trap, in the kitchen all we sell is white
In the hallway with them thirty's, we be totin' pipes
Betta not be no fucking opp or you gone lose your life
Got niggas dieing niggas wilding killing for the set
And if you play with the shits then you can get wet
Hollow tips hit his brain he won't remember that
Trap stars bitch we flying were the pigeons at
Selling phony work damn what type of shit is that
Went from selling weed, to pushing crack
500 dollars round my way niggas kill for that
500 dollars get a nigga fucking whack

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Out here on the grind wanna come up
Ain't gone tell you twice, I'mma tell you once (once)
I can introduce you to this trap life (trap life)
I can introduce you to this trap life

[Dialogue]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
(Ballout)
I can introduce you to this trap life (skkrrtt)
Lil niggas in the kitchen, whipping white (skkrrtt)
And they shooting thirty's if they don't look right (bang)
Got to watch faces, in this trap life (who is you?)
Niggas cops, niggas snitching, niggas telling lies (niggas telling)
I don't trust niggas (no)
Get 'em out my sight (out my sight)
They be acting (acting)
Like they down to ride (ride)
When the cops catch 'em they be out the same night (same night)
See that's the crazy shit (shit)
About this trap life (about this trap life)
Niggas say they trapping, but they ain't trapping right
These niggas telling lies (lies)
My niggas selling pies (pies)
I told you I could introduce you to this trap life (trap life)

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Out here on the grind wanna come up
Ain't gone tell you twice, I'mma tell you once (once)

Wanna sell hard wanna be a star (star)
Wanna fuck bitches wanna drive cars (foreign)
