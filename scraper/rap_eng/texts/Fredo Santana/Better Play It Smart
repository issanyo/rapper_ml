[Hook]
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Got some young niggas with me that'll take the charge
That'll take the charge, that'll take the charge
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Got some young niggas with me like they kill shit
Once I show them the hit-list, they hit the kill switch
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Told my young nigga hit your face and not your heart

[Verse]
Want that gangsta shit? well I'mma give it to him
Hunnid shots to his ass while his sister with him
Better play it smart, better play it smart
My shooters shoot, broad day, they don't care if it's dark
Pull up in black vans and lettin' 'em pistols bark
You ain't hear the news? 6 niggas in chalk
These niggas remind me of bitches cause all they do is talk
Should've been in the NBA cause all I do is ball
Shootin' shit old to me what is new to ya'll
Theses niggas must play for AM1 cause all they do is cross
These niggas fake tough, they foolin' yall
But I don't say much shit, I let my Ruger talk

[Hook]
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Got some young niggas with me that'll take the charge
That'll take the charge, that'll take the charge
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Got some young niggas with me like they kill shit
Once I show them the hit-list, they hit the kill switch
Better play it smart, better play it smart
Told my young nigga hit your face and not your heart
