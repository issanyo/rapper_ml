[Hook: Gino Marley]
Load it up, it's a road trip
I got money everywhere, I'm on my plug shit
My amigo throw me kilos them just more bricks
U-Hauls and truckloads, it's a road trip
Road trip, road trip
My amigo got them kilo's taking road trips
Road trip, road trip
Load it up and ship it out it's on a road trip

[Verse 1: Gino Marley]
My amigo got them kilos taking road trips
All this money in my spot I'm on my plug shit
Truckloads in the car with a road bitch
Getting caught with them bricks, you don't know shit
'Lotta grams in the back weighing down the trunk
Prices switch up every week, depends on what you want
And when I first meet you, gotta tell me where you from
And I can never play the back, 'cuz I'm from the Front
Money come, money goes I'm on a money hunt
Call my 'migo say I'm done, ship another one
Money come, money goes I'm on a money hunt
Call my 'migo road trip, I need another one

[Hook: Gino Marley]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Road trips with the bricks, tryna make it work
Eight bricks in my trunk, I got major work
Say your trap kinda slow? Well I'mma make it work
Cocaine, ecstasy, kush, molly, purp
Straight drop on the work, fiends go berserk
Looking like an aid office at my back door
Straight drop on the work, fiends go berserk
Looking like an aid office at my back door
Don't say shit bitch this a road trip
And if the police pull us over then it's your bricks
I can take a loss just rob my plug for more bricks
And I don't carry guns unless they got a 30 clip
