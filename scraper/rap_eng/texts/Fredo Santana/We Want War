That fufu shit, we ain't on it
Getting money, call it scoring
Bad bitch, you ain't boring
Gun on me while I'm touring
Pussy nigga think it ain't on me
Squad shit, we want war

That fufu shit, we ain't on it
Getting money, call it scoring
Bad bitch, you ain't boring
Gun on me while I'm touring
Pussy nigga think it ain't on me
Squad shit, we want war
Squad shit, we want war
Squad shit, we want war

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Woah, riding 'round with yo thot
In the car, she give me top
Pull up like skarr
Bang bang, duh duh duh
With the Glocks
Finna pop
Remember when I ain't had guap
Now I got a lot
Now I got a house
Now I got a watch
But I still got me a Glock
And I'm still from the block
Still sending some shots
And the mothafucking knot
I be spending guap
We spending guap and getting guap
Smoking lots of pot
Remember when I sold rocks on the block
I was out when it was hot, when it was not
When it was dead, when it was not
300 shots, we got 300 blocks
Call 300 cops, got 300 Glocks

That fufu shit, we ain't on it
Getting money, call it scoring
Bad bitch, you ain't boring
Gun on me while I'm touring
Pussy nigga think it ain't on me
Squad shit, we want war
Squad shit, we want war
That fufu shit, we ain't on it
Getting money, call it scoring
Bad bitch, you ain't boring
Gun on me while I'm touring
Pussy nigga think it ain't on me
Squad shit, we want war
Squad shit, we want war
Squad shit, we want war

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Need a pint of lean, man I drink that shit like everyday
Tell this bitch I'm shooting first, nigga I don't hesitate
And my trap house hella weight, nigga I'm in every state
Racks bussing out my jeans, nigga I got hella cake
He can say he real but I know they hella fake
Acting like a monkey, get shot when your Bathing Ape
We getting money over here, they got that baby cake
Birdman, real shit, I got that Baby cake
Whipping up a whole thing, show you how that bacon made
I'm the shit, these niggas pussy, shit that's what my lady say
Nigga looking at me wrong, nigga just might die today
Looking like Scarface, holding on my AK

[Hook: Lil Reese]
That fufu shit, we ain't on it
Getting money, call it scoring
Bad bitch, you ain't boring
Gun on me while I'm touring...
