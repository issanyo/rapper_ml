[Intro: Fredo Santana]
I done fell in love
I done fell in love
I done fell in love with the dope game
With the dope game
With the dope game

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
Turn two thang to a four piece (whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
I done fell in love with the dope game
I done fell in love with the dope game

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Mansion trapping fuck abandon
Baby don't you see my wrist how it's dancin'
They like damn Chief Sosa, why you flexin'?
Cause I member all the times I ain't had shit
Remember pullin' up, Volvo, posted on Front Street sellin' coco
Bitch I smoke dope, I don't snort dope
Bitch I sell coke, I don't snort coke
I ain't give no fuck if I was trappin'
Pull up on a opp block and get to clappin'
Couple bands on my clothes and my MAC-10
I'm a shoot a muthafucka through this fashion

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
Turn two thang to a four piece (whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
I done fell in love with the dope game
I done fell in love with the dope game)

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
In the trap house whippin' all this cocaine
Hit the lean man up I need two thangs
So bossed up bitches tie my shoe strangs
Who is you? I can't serve you, you lookin' too strange
Call up Lil' Moochie like to shoot thangs
40 cal kickin' bullets just like Liu Kang
Niggas gettin' young money call em Mac Mane
Watch this choppa flip some cars while I'm shootin'
Frontstreet 061 that's my domain
Number posted on the block with three dope names
Sellin' all the fiends while I'm toting
I ain't give a fuck long as the money comin' in

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
In the trap house whippin' up a whole key
Turn two thang to a four piece (whip, whip, whip)
Niggas say they got shooters, well show me
Got shooters on a squad like Kobe
In my left pocket, 'bout a whole thang
This ain't rap money this off cocaine
I done fell in love with the dope game
