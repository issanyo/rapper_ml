[Intro : Fredo Santana]
I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas in this bitch we gon' spazz out
I'mma spazz out, spazz out

[Hook : Fredo Santana]
In the party throwin' racks don't make us spazz out
If a nigga try us shoot his ass down
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
Got the chopper in the cut don't make me spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make me spazz out

[Verse 1 : Fredo Santana]
I ain't worried bout shit I'm in the trap house
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
All these racks in my pocket I'm bout to cash out
I brought the bank with me I'm bout to spazz down
In the club ball these bitches with their ass out
All these racks in the air watch me spazz out
Got a couple bitches with me then I swagg out
You ain't heard bout Fredo better ask about

[Bridge]
See I be chasing money and I be chasing faces
These niggas be bitches you can see it in their faces
That money got me errywhere going different places
That money got me errywhere going different places

[Hook]
In the party throwin' racks don't make us spazz out
If a nigga try us shoot his ass down
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
Got the chopper in the cut don't make me spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make me spazz out


[Verse 2 : Sd]
I'mma spazz out, I'm bout to spazz out
You can end up slick tryna camp out
Got my shooters with me don't make us spazz out
In the party with the 30 shoot his ass down
I'mma spazz out, I'm bout to spazz out
Got these bitches bout to dozen the drugs by the pound
Got these guns with me don't make 'em blast down
I ain't worried bout shit I brought the squad out
I brought the guys out
We bout to spazz out
Talking money round me, we love to take out
These niggas wanna be me, better ask around
I'm a god in this shit you better bow down

[Hook]
In the party throwin' racks don't make us spazz out
If a nigga try us shoot his ass down
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
Got the chopper in the cut don't make me spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make us spazz out
I'mma spazz out, I'mma spazz out
Got my niggas with me don't make me spazz out
