[Hook: Fredo Santana]
All I ever wanted
To make it to the top
All I ever wanted
To count all this guap
All I ever wanted
Was a hundred fuckin' bricks & a hundred fuckin' licks
All I ever wanted
Was a bad lil bitch do anything to get me rich
All I ever wanted
For my mama to be straight & I can get this cake
All I ever wanted
To call up my plug and I ain't gotta wait

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Yous a broke nigga boy
You want some pussy and some liquor
Got a bad bitch eatin' a bitch pussy
While a bitch rollin' my swishers
I got 4 or 5 trap houses
Doin' 6 figures
I'm that nigga
I'm that nigga
I ain't gotta pull that trigger
And I'm so comfortable cookin' this brick
I put a couch up in my kitchen
The way I load this base
Youda thought I was a pitcher
Keep a long nose shit
Call me Scotty Pippin
Niggas sneak dissin' shit
I ain't even hear em

Fuck a brick
