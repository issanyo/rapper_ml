[Hook]
Watch me whip a whole chicken over the damn pot
Watch me pull up in the drop, and I leave the lot
All eyes on me bitch I'm 2Pac
Watch me pull up wit' that tool and let that tool pop
Watch me stunt up on these broke niggas wit' a new knot
Watch me do all this shit that you not
Watch me trap out in my trap house til' my trap hot
Watch me pull up on the opps then the opps drop

[Bridge]
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch, watch me

[Verse 1]
Watch me pull up wit two Glocks, watch me kill two opps
I don't give no mother fuck, where you at, here I come
I got Juice and Capper wit me and you know they shoot for fun
I got Xannies, kush, and lean, and I'ma do the drugs
I done smoked a whole pound, I think I killed my lungs
I got shooters in the cut, we chill up in this crib
I got shooters all around, don't make me send it up
I'm ballin you out of bounds, boy just give it up
I just whipped a whole brick, can't thank my wrist enough
I think that I'm the shit, can fuck any bitch I want
My trap house full of bricks, but I think that I need some more
Niggas wanna flex, gon' end up on a shirt

[Hook]
Watch me whip a whole chicken over the damn pot
Watch me pull up in the drop, and not leave it locked
All eyes on me bitch I'm 2Pac
Watch me pull up wit' that tool and let that tool pop
Watch me stunt up on these broke niggas wit' a new knot
Watch me do all this shit that you not
Watch me trap out in my trap house til' my trap hot
Watch me pull up on the opps then the opps drop

[Verse 2]
Two turnt bitch I got my cash out
I'm big boss I never see a damn drought
Nigga snitch on me then he's a damn mouse
Kill 'em next day, no 48 hours
I got respect, wit the tech, and the damn power
Trap house full of Molly's, xanax, and that powder
Only fuck wit real killers, savage, no cowards
Sneak dissin' me, kill yo ass in a hour
I had yo bitch give me top while we in the shower
And when she done I kick her ass out right after
I'ma blessin to these bitches call me Fredo Pastor
And when I fucked that bitch once then you know I passed her
And you know I passed her, and you know I passed her
Might fuck that bitch again, man you know I passed her
Man you know I passed her, man you know I passed her
And I fucked that bitch once then you know I passed her

[Hook]
Watch me whip a whole chicken over the damn pot
Watch me pull up in the drop, and not leave it locked
All eyes on me bitch I'm 2Pac
Watch me pull up wit' that tool and let that tool pop
Watch me stunt up on these broke niggas wit' a new knot
Watch me do all this shit that you not
Watch me trap out in my trap house til' my trap hot
Watch me pull up on the opps then the opps drop

Fuck em!
