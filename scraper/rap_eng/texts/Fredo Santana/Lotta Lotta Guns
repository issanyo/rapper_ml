[Hook]
Fredo from Chiraq and I got a lot of guns
Eyes so red 'cuz I'm off a lot of drugs
Nigga try to rob me and he get lots of slugs
Everyone be quiet, I'm on the phone with the plug
Bitch I trap, I only rap just for fun
Persona'd up, man your bitch can't get enough
She ain't getting nun' but that bitch can get a nut
Everyone be quiet, I'm on the phone with the plug
(Plug!)

[Verse 1]
Who was there for me when I was down and out
Who was there for me when I slept from couch to couch
Niggas fake, man they only what your dime
Jealous ass niggas man I don't want around
Caper rolling up, man we smoke out the pound
When we pull up, best believe it's going down
Nigga disrespect then his body is on the ground
(I hope I don't go down)
(Plug!)
Word to biggie, I'm counting hundreds in my Coogi
Pull up with my toolie and my niggas act a foolie
In my broski Herbo voice "All these niggas brewfurds"
Pull up on the scene man, all my niggas shooters
Book me for a show, shit I ain't got security
Pull up on the show, nigga I ain't tuck my jewelry
Niggas wanna hate but I'mma get to shooting
(Plug!)
Niggas wanna hate but Imma get to shooting
If you ain't getting no money?
What the fuck you doing? (huh-huh)
What the fuck you doing?
What the fuck you doing?
