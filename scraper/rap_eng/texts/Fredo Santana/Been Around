[Hook: Gino Marley]
Bag the work at the kitchen counter
Living room, lotta drugs. Couple money counters
One couch, two chairs. No sitting down around us
And ain't nobody in this bitch who ain't been around us
Fuck around and break the door, we work out public housing
Fuck around and break the bowl from putting whips around it
Fuck around and break the stove, all these pots around It
And ain't nobody in this bitch who ain't been around us

[Verse 1: Fredo]
One stove, two pots and a lot of workers
Walk in my trap all you see is fucking birdies
Walk to the back all you see is fucking junkies
Got a lot of clientele and a lot of money
Gotta thank the Lord, Gotta thank these junkies
Earlier tn the Morning, I'm talking 7:30
Get the work Saturday, the shit gone Sunday
Hit my phone. What you want?
I'll be there in a hurry
Five wet bricks on the table, letting the shit dry
And I don't like my bitches straight
I like my bitches bi
And Ion touch the work no more, I let my bitches bag
And if you run up on me you getting a fucking shitbag

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gino]
Early morning bagging work at the kitchen counter
Trap shit, waking up hearing money counters
Trap shit, waking up still got clucks around us
And ain't nobody in this bitch who ain't been around us
Spot open, got it all. Talking ups and downers
Faces coming in fast, I let a foreigner count it
Might catch me by a beach if my plug around it
And before you run up in my spot, no guns around it
And I spend my money fast, fast than I count it
But I won't spend it on a bitch, so bring the plug around me
And I spend my money fast, fast than I count it
But I won't spend it on a bitch, so bring the plug around me

[Hook]
