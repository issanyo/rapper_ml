[Intro: Fredo Santana]
Cook the dope up
Cook the dope up
Cook the dope up
Cook the dope up

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
In the kitchen whippin' cookin' dope up
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
My trap be boomin' it don't slow up
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
In the kitchen whippin' cookin' dope up
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
My trap be boomin' it don't slow up

[Verse: Fredo Santana]
In the trap serving dope with a lot of guns
If a nigga try to rob then you know I'm blowing
Two for ten, on the dope, got my trap boomin'
If the police run in here me and my niggas shootin'
Cook the dope up, dope, cook the dope up
I bring the mask out if my trap slow up
Cook the dope up, cook the dope up
Drought season turn a half into a whole one
You ain't seen a drought, you ain't a real trapper
To me these niggas actors, you want a brick, I'm taxing
Got fiends they spend their taxes, will disappear like magic
Balling like I'm the Mavericks, all of my niggas savage

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
In the kitchen whippin'cookin dope up
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
My trap be boomin' it don't slow up
Cook the dope up, dough
Cook the dope up, dough
In the kitchen whippin' cookin' dope up
Cook the dope up, dope
Cook the dope up, dope
My trap be boomin' it don't slow up
