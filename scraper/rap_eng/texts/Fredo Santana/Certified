[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Hundred grand in my pocket, I can't even walk
You ain't talking money, boy, I can't even talk
Talking kinda crazy get your gang knocked off

Knowing damn well, they mother fucking soft
Your baby mama gave me top I told that bitch get lost
Walking round like a gangster but survey said that's false

Bad bitches in my phone, you should see my texts
Fuck that little thot face, then I tell her [?]
Boss little bitch, on my name they put respect
I'm a boss little bitch I was born just to flex
I look up in the mirror I see a real nigga face
These fake ass niggas in a real nigga's way
