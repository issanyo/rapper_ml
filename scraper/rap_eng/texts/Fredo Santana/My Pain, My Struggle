[Hook]
They don't know my struggle, they don't feel my pain
They don't know I had to hustle, for everything I gained
Got a hunnid shooters, all of us got aim
Nigga disrespect me, then his ass get changed
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain

[Verse 1]
Ain't too many real niggas in the street, they all fake
Ain't too much love in the street, it's all hate
Told my plug, Throw me this weight, we all straight
Mama hit my phone say she need a couple thousand
Sent that shit straight to her, and I ain't even have it
Real niggas do real things, that's automatic
Police kick my door when I was sixteen that shit was tragic
Bounce back like it was luck, told my plug to keep it thumbin
He went down on his number, now I'm on my [?]

[Hook]
They don't know my struggle, they don't feel my pain
They don't know I had to hustle, for everything I gained
Got a hunnid shooters, all of us got aim
Nigga disrespect me, then his ass get changed
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain

[Verse 2]
They don't know 'bout hand to hand in the snow til' my knuckles cold
They don't know 'bout standing in that field tryna get every bundle gone
They don't man, they don't know man, they don't know man, they don't know
They don't know man, they don't know, they only see the fame
Where these niggas at, when I ain't have no name
Where the fuck they was at, when I was sellin cocaine
Fredo keep two Glocks ain't no takin his chain
They took Blood and Cap from me, it ain't the same
They took Blood and Cap from me, shoulda took some lames
They took Blood and Cap from me, wouldn't feel my pain
They took Blood and Cap from me, that change everything

[Hook]
They don't know my struggle, they don't feel my pain
They don't know I had to hustle, for everything I gained
Got a hunnid shooters, all of us got aim
Nigga disrespect me, then his ass get changed
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
They don't know my struggle, they don't know my pain
