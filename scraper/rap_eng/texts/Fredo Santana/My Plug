[Verse 1: Gino Marley]
My plug, he be speaking Spanish
These hoes know we super savage
Up for action, down for clappin'
Squad we with whatever happen
Others say we're living lavish
Nah bitch we living savage
Only talk I'm super manage
Try to rob another clappin'
Off the shits about the action
Pull up and pistols clappin'
Trues with the pistols flashin'
Mollies, I forgot what happened
All I know a nigga tweak
Quick draw: Pistol Pete
Plug meet up mad weak
Somewhere on Laguna Beach
You ain't shoot you ain't with me
Hood shit play the streets
Grind that's for days and weeks
In the trap I fall asleep
Plug meet up mad weak
Somewhere around the beach
Hood shit play the streets
Same nigga different speech

Trapping out them public houses
You ain't shooting get from 'round me

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
My plug he be speaking Spanish
It's me that say I gotta watch him
He know that them peoples watching
Now I'm Desert Eagle walking
My plug he be speaking Spanish
It's me that say I gotta watch him
He know that them peoples watching

Looking for who I think is talking
Now their mama picking coffins
If you want it come and cop it
You know that I fucking got it
Work wasn't moving 'til I got with my new plug
What's up with all these new thugs?
Call my phone if you do drugs
It's a young nigga like to shoot stuff
Quick to let my gun bust
Fuck you think I got my gun for?
I ain't with all that small talk
Ambulance, white chalk
Fuck think got my lawyer for?
Trap house full of dope
White bitches sniffin' coke
Fuck you think I got my lawyer for?
Trap house full of dope
White bitches sniffin' coke

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]

My plug, he be talking Spanish
Let's just say I'm super savage
Trapping out them public houses
You ain't shooting get from 'round me

Your bitch got a stupid body
Yeah she fuck me and she suck me
