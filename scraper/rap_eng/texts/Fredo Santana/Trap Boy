[Intro: Fredo Santana]
Growin' up, I was just another black boy
So I grabbed some work
And hit the trap boy
I'm a rapper, but don't confuse me with these rap boys
I be in the trap with them shooters and them trap boys
I'm a trap boy
I'm a trap boy
On the corner gangbangin' with them trap boys
I'm a trap boy
I'm a trap boy
Got the macks and them tecs that make hella' noise
Got the macs and them tecs that make hella' noise


[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Got some thots and they bad and they hella' gone
Off that lean, off that drink, I be hella' floored
Got some work in my trunk and its hella' strong
Got some niggas in the burbs that move hella O's
I'm Fredo bitch I got guap, I got hella' hoes
Try me, you'll die filled up with hella' holes
I got shooters on the roof with some telescopes
Got yo bitch in the back doing a team bitch
She let the whole squad hit, 300 the team bitch
Got yo bitch in the back doing a team bitch
She let the whole squad hit, 300 the team bitch

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Growin' up, I was just another black boy
So I grabbed some work
And hit the trap boy
I'm a rapper, but don't confuse me with these rap boys
I be in the trap with them shooters and them trap boys
I'm a trap boy
I'm a trap boy
On the corner gangbangin' with them trap boys
I'm a trap boy
I'm a trap boy
Got the macs and them tecs that make hella' noise
