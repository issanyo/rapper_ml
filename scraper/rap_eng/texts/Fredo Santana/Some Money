[Hook]
Walked in this bitch and I'm lookin' like some money
All I ever wanted was them blue face hunnids
Fifty pounds of OG, I can pull up, where your home be
Ain't no robbin me boy I keep that on me

[Verse]
Disrespect the squad you get wet up
I got bitches, ratchet bitches that'll set you up
Cali smokin OG wit' my feet up
Trap house every state, nigga keep up
Might want the bitch but I don't need her
Feel like I won a ring when I re-up
When I shoot this pistol I shoot neck and up
Think you in your glo boy you not fresh enough
Got my Margiela's on nigga step it up
Nigga get killed tryna step to us
Got my Margiela's on nigga step it up
A nigga get killed tryna step to us

[Hook]
Walked in this bitch and I'm lookin' like some money
All I ever wanted was them blue face hunnids
Fifty pounds of OG, I can pull up, where your home be
Ain't no robbin me boy I keep that on me
