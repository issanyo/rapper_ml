[Verse 1 : Fredo Santana]
I come from the streets, that's why street niggas feel me
And I know I did a lot to make niggas wanna kill me
If I told you what I did I know you won't believe me
Growing up in the Chi man I swear ain't wasn't easy
I speak real street shit, real street shit from the heart
I done came a long way from selling nickels out the lot
I done sold a lot of cocaine at my back door
How many times the police kick my shit, about four
I done did a lot of dirt, I done sold a lot of work
Just to take the pain away I just pour another four
N'other four, I just pour another four
Just to take the pain away I just pour another four

[Verse 2 : Capo]
Gotta get the guap and leave you stay bro', don't know about chu
All of these hoes wanna be up in my business, wanna know what I do
Just me & Fredo
Going to smoke, and lets hit Tadoe
Goin on the same song
Got some Glocks fuck nigga lay low
If you want pure drama, smoke him & his mama
Riding 'round with my llama
And if we see an op I got 'em
Homeboy I fucked your bitch
No, no, I don’t want her
And I just want top from her, hell no I can’t cuff
And I love getting all this money, like I love my mama
And I got duwop with my Glock if I got any problems
Fuck nigga don't stand in my face, won't you wanna say sumthin' ?
Niggas ain't tryna talk to me tho', if it ain't about no money
