[Hook]
Comin' up, I had roaches mouse in my crib
Swear to God, I ain't neva had shit
Man, I came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Man, I came up from the bottom
Hundreds in my right, hundreds in my left
Try to rob me, I swear to God you get left
Cause I came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Came up from the bottom
Man, I came up from the bottom

[Verse 1]
Drinkin' lean out the bottle, cause today I'm feelin' great
Got this 30 on me, don't make me put it in yo face
Cause I came up from the bottom, you kill for em dollas
Put it on my momma, man, I swear I'm chasing gwala
R.I.P. to my homies, lot of niggas be phoney
Hopin I fall off, I tell 'em wait on it
Cause I came up from the bottom, sellin' dope in the projects
Juggin' and finnessin', doin whateva get profit
Savage squad my squad, we go to war with the country
I'm so cool with this cool on my mac
I swear to God it get ugly
All my bitches they love me, all yo bitches dusty
I came up from the bottom, I swear i neva had nuttin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hundreds bitches on my dick, 30k up on my wrist
Came up from the bottom, I ain't neva had shit
Can't forget first time when I learned how to whip
Seen that shit, ain't been right since
Came up from the bottom, yo ass a get slaughtered
If it get serious, kidnap yo mamma and daughter
Shootin' .30s at yo apartment, catch you lackin' at yo garbage
These niggas ain't with the shits, I swear to God they imposters
Flexin' on these bitches, you can ask yo baby momma
Went from eatin noodles baloney, now Im eatin steak and lobster
Lot of niggas snitchin', man they talkin' to the coppers
Ever since a yung nigga been runnin' afta dollas
