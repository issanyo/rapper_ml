[Intro: Fredo Santana]
Just a young hustla
I gotta get it, I gotta get it
I gotta get it, I gotta get it

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Bill g, GBE, that's how we stunt them bricks
Got Columbian, Jamaican plugs and I know Mexicans
Fredo, Reese, they on 64th, I fuck with Sosa them
Every month on the 24th I get some more of them
Truckloads of them bricks and bells took up all of it
I put my name off a clientele, that black amigo shit
I was list for 4 rounds, I was street profit
I got 5 different plugs, that's a lot of profit
If a plug bring problem, you know I could handle it
I robbed a lot of plugs, they known for snitching in the end
So when I need some bricks, I just make some more of them
300 glory boys, black amigo balling

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Gotta get this money so you know I'm trappin stupid hard
I don't give a fuck who you are, serve to your mobs
I need that diamond, the trap we taking chains too
Turn your ass around, you look suspicious, we ain't serving you
Scooter bring that vet out, we ran around with that tec out
Fuck niggas stretched out on the concrete with they chest out
Hunned killers when I step out, hunnid grand in my safe house
Killers with me, they safe out
Kick the door really safe out

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Got a couple plugs but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
All these bricks coming in
But I need more, but I need more
All these bitches on my dick
But I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
Got a lot of money but I think I need more
Think I need more, think I need more
