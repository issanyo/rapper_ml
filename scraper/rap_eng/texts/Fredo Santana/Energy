[Chorus]
I get money in every season, these niggas hate for no reason
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas, I don't be liking their energy
Niggas say that they your friend but really they your frienemy
Wanna crush you any second they get, really they your enemy
Might fuck around and pull up with a hundred clips
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit

[Verse]
Niggas want to go to war, what they must be ludicrous
Pull up on a nigga block, get up on my stupid shit
Pull up to a nigga crib, whack him and his fucking bitch
I will send my shooters at your house, 'cause they say they need it out
I will whack a nigga in broad day, nigga I ain't new to this
Kidnap my old plug, 'cause he shorted me on a brick
Niggas say I'm going to hell but really I don't give a shit
I'll smack the hell up out the devil and trap out all in his shit
Say you're super gangster, damn pull up on a kid
We don't do no leg shots, niggas we stretching shit
Say you're super gangster, damn pull up on a kid
We don't do no leg shots, niggas we stretching shit

[Chorus]
I get money in every season, these niggas hate for no reason
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas, I don't be liking their energy
Niggas say that they your friend but really they your frienemy
Wanna crush you any second they get, really they your enemy
Might fuck around and pull up with a hundred clips
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit
Fuck you and your fuck your clique, I be on that other shit
