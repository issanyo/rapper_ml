[Hook]
Trap going nuts
My trap going crazy
Selling cocaine like the mother fucking 80's
Nigga try to tweet, kill him and his baby
Catch you ass in traffic and I'm shooting your Mercedes
I was born a savage you can ask my old lady
The way I whip the dope, man, I swear it's so amazing
When you was on the porch, man, I was catchin cases
Just bought a new chopper man I finna go crazy

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Got the white girl in my trap, Stacey
You know I can not show up to your club, bitch you pay me
Got 2 bricks left, and they stepped on
Started going crazy for all the years I was slept on
My momma told me that these bitches ain't shit
Do everything by yourself these niggas gonna snitch
Trapped out, till a nigga get rich
I'm trapped up, I got 30 in my clip

Trap going nuts

I was born a savage you can ask my old lady
The way I whip the dope, man, I swear it's so amazing
When you was on the porch, man, I was catchin cases
Just bought a new chopper man I finna go crazy

[Verse 2: Gino Marley]
I say trap house jumping, trap going crazy
In the kitchen working [?]
A couple shooters on the team that's gonna do the hit, no [?]
Guess them niggas on the team [?]
Scope on the rifle, I got tired of the lasers
Dreamed about the money since the Marley had a fade cut
Dreamed about the money since my uncle had a paycheck
Serving to my family to serve it to a stranger
