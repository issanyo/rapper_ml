3 Hunnid, G.B.E. shit mayne
BANG !

[Hook]
Tryna get some money gotta take risks
Hit the highway up with like 8 bricks
Fuck the police, gotta take trips
Put your trust in yourself don't ever trust a bitch
Hit the kitchen up & water whip
You gotta stretch that work you wanna be rich
Tryna get some money gotta take risks
Tryna get some money gotta take risks

[Verse 1 : Blood Money]
I'm a super savage, got a money habit
I'm addicted to bad bitches I gotta have it
Fear risks erryday transporting cabbage
In & out of state moving like a jackrabbit
Whole lot of drugs on me gotta meet the casket
Caper Boy on the block, tryna make it happen
Errybody in the squad ain't no fucking rapper
Try & poke me if you wanna I'mma get to clappin'
They know who to call, scorpions be on the package
Money longer than train tracks, ye I'm cashing
Loud men from California and he ain't taxing
One shipment a month nigga and I'm relaxing

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Fredo Santana]
In the streets every day I be taking risks
Make that work work, make the shit flip
I ain't taking no losses only taking risks
Fucking foreign bitches, driving foreign whips
Just rob my plug came up I took a risk
I be taking shit, these niggas fake as shit
What you call your wife, I call a basic bitch
High as fuck like Bob Marley on my jamaican shit
Don't make me take this spraying shit, Tommys, Macs, AKs and shit
Over the stove I'm working out, I'm guilty man I'm with the shit
I ain’t with all that talkin' shit, I don’t do no boxin' shit
All I know is pistols pop, we turned up & we dropping shit

[Hook]
