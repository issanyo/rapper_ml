[Hook]
Ain't shit changed bitch I'm still in the cut ho
Straight chopped in the hood, fuck I gotta cut if fo'?
Riding with that scale on me, niggas might tell on me
I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I got that bail money
Can't trust these niggas 'cause these niggas be snakes
Can't trust these niggas 'cause these niggas be fake
I can get it cheaper, let me hit my people
Niggas hating on me and I'm balling in the bleachers

[Verse 1]
Remember when I was little, wanted to fuck my teacher
Now I'm getting so much money I should fuck my teacher
Think I'm Lil Wayne bitch, finna have a seizure
Leaning so damn hard shit I done spilled lean cup
Heard Future and Jay Z got the keys well let me in bruh
Cruising in my own lane, tell these niggas keep up
Who's that knocking at my door, let me grab my heater
Trigger happy then motherfucker Imma squeeze up
Ay, motherfucker Imma squeeze something
Higher than the sun bitch, feel like I'm off X or something
Little bitch looking at me like she want sex or something
Hit her with that wink then I tell that bitch to text or something
Fuck a 'Rari, a Bentley, bitch I need a G6
Homicide grimy, nah I ain't seen shit
Might not say nothing, but you know I peep shit
This is Savage Squad and you know you in some deep shit

[Hook]
Ain't shit changed bitch I'm still in the cut ho
Straight chopped in the hood, fuck I gotta cut if fo'?
Riding with that scale on me, niggas might tell on me
I don't give a fuck 'cause you know I got that bail money
Can't trust these niggas 'cause these niggas be snakes
Can't trust these niggas 'cause these niggas be fake
I can get it cheaper, let me hit my people
Niggas hating on me and I'm balling in the bleachers
