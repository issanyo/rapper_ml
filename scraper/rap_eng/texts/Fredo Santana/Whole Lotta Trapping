[Hook]
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
In at least thirty minutes I done smoked about an ounce
The hoe ain't wanna suck then I told that bitch bounce
It's a million bitches around tryna suck me for my clout
Ain't worried 'bout no beef I got choppers in my couch
Fake ass trappers need to sit they ass down
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house

[Verse 1]
When I think it's beef, get to pull up, shoot like basketball
Niggas think they drinkin lean but drinkin' Tylenol
I'm a real nigga man don't confuse me wit' none of ya'll
No I'm not a rapper boy, I'm a fuckin' trapper boy
Lookin' like a goofy then I'ma have to tax you boy
Dissin' me, kidnap your boy, don't nobody wonder what happen boy
I don't got no friends, but hunnids, fifties, and Jackson's boy
Keep the ski mask, don't know when I was jackin boy

[Hook]
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
In at least thirty minutes I done smoked about an ounce
The hoe ain't wanna suck then I told that bitch bounce
It's a million bitches around tryna suck me for my clout
Ain't worried 'bout no beef I got choppers in my couch
Fake ass trappers need to sit they ass down
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house

[Verse 2]
Whole lotta trappin' I just sold a fuckin bird
'Member sellin' nickle bags, servin on the curb
Now I got a bag and I'm fuckin on a nurse
Police pull us over, put the .30 in her purse
Aye, put that .30 in her purse
Trap house hot, police gettin' on my nerves
'Member havin bad work tryna make that shit work
Thotties on my line but I hit 'em with that curve
Just get up out my face if you ain't tryna whip a bird
Trappin' stupid hard to the first to the first
I get 'em for the low, they like word, I'm like word

[Hook]
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
In at least thirty minutes I done smoked about an ounce
The hoe ain't wanna suck then I told that bitch bounce
It's a million bitches around tryna suck me for my clout
Ain't worried 'bout no beef I got choppers in my couch
Fake ass trappers need to sit they ass down
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
It's a whole lotta trapping goin' on in this house
