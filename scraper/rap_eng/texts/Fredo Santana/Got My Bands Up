[Hook]
All these bitches want me cause I got my bands up
All this money on me cause I got my bands up
I don't trust his soul cause I got my bands up
I keep a gun on me cause I got my bands up
I got my bands up (Bands up!)
I got my bands up (Money!)
I got my bands up (Guap!)
I got my bands up (Beep!)

[Verse 1]
Grab a pint of lean then I grab some two liters
Ain't none robbing me cause I'm riding with my heater
Send you up to the lord man you must wanna meet him
Dear lord man I wouldn't wanna be him
I can't go for no sucker shit
I swear I will never love a bitch
We can fuck but I don't do relationships
Everybody want something but I ain't seeing when I ain't have shit
Just bought a .30 and some drum rolls
Keep my gun on me so ion' make phone calls
Hundred racks just to flex we all get money now so nigga ion' stress at all

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Niggas hate but they acting like yo homie
Say they real but they really be phony
Fake ass niggas probably be the police
Just me, my gun, and this codeine
Hell no I don't trust you niggas
Hell no I don't fuck with niggas
We can go to war lets get it bustin' nigga
Soon as we see each other its a shootout no discussion nigga
Broke niggas never seen a brick
Man these niggas ain't know shit
Get so much money I swear I just be buying shit
Got so much money god damn I'll buy a bitch
