[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I remember when the whole world turned they back
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when the whole world turned they back
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Had to get up off my ass and chase this cash
They don't wanna see you and they wanna see you last
I done lost so many in the street, man this shit sad
I done lost so many in the street I hardly even laugh
I done lost so many in the street I can barely even smile
Long live Cap and Blood, I love y'all 'til infinity
Long live Y, man I swear y'all 'posed to be with me
Thinking like damn, why didn't I take that flight to AZ
Man I miss them guys, swear to god I miss my guys
Every time I think about it I wanna get high
Thinking to the lord like why you take my guys?
And every time I think about it I just wanna cry

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I remember when the whole world turned they back
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when the whole world turned they back
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad

[Verse 2: Iman Shumpert]
They mad at the usual
I'm grabbin' my usual
I don't mind when you seein' me
Upon leaving I'm losing you
We tryna go home and go celebrate
We through with the funerals
Immune to the evening news and you remember whole world turned they back
I keep it one hundred
I keep like ten thousand in hundreds
Left hand on the wheel when I'm whippin' my nigga
They gotta know that's how I'm comin'
They gotta know it's gon' be bustin'
If I'm the one comin' for hoes in the function my nigga
They gotta know I'm into something
Man we come from nothing, man we just productive
Bookbag with no books in it
Sunflower seeds and some hoopin' shoes
A bloody shirt off some other shit
But you never know what you'll get into
I'm just tryna keep the profits steady
Then double that when the time come
Even make sure it's a forty winner
And that fence real when that time come

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I remember when the whole world turned they back
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when I used to wake without a dime
I remember when the whole world turned they back
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
Niggas see me hustlin' now they gettin' mad
