[Hook]
Buy four bricks, my plug from the six
So much money it don't make no sense
Once I fuck a bitch, a name, I forget it
And if she suck me good I might pay her rent
It don't make no sense
It don't make no sense
Got 100 guns nigga, I am with the shits
It don't make no sense
It don't make no sense
How I'm trapping and I'm rapping it don't make no sense

[Verse 1]
Got 100 fucking guns and I be on dumb shit
Got my mama texting me like Fredo that don't make no sense
But I can't be lacking man you know how shit is
I'm gonna break in your damn crib trying to pay my damn rent
Now I'm all up in [?] and getting what I spent
Trap, smoking dope I'm just cooling with this little bitch
She like: "Fredo why you got tats up on your face?
You know goddamn well that don't make no goddamn sense"
I'm like shut up little bitch
Before I smack you into some goddamn sense
Sneak dissing me, get flatlined  quick
Money coming fast you [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That work be gone before I bust it out the package
I don't fuck with rappers cause half these niggas actors
Money in the closet and these bitches on my mattress
Bitches kissing on me leaving lipstick on my boxers
Thirty all on me, nigga I don't do no boxing
Smoke a lot of swishers man, I need a couple of boxes
What you staring at? Are you a fan or an OPP
Don't make me paranoia, I'm gonna reach for my chopper
[?]
I think the nigga hating cause I fucked his baby mama
0-6-1 front street, posted waiting for the drama
Killing anything that come between my commas

[Hook]
