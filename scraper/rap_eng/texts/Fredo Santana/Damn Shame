[Intro]

[Hook]
My trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Booming off the chain
Serving all these J's
My trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Booming off the chain
Serving all these J's
Trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Booming off the chain
Serving all these J's

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Trap house booming it's a God damn shame
Got weed, got pills
So you know we got game
Only savages in my squad
Boy, we don't fuck with lames
Young boss nigga
Put some change on your brain
In the trap house bitch
On my trap house shit
Got 30s in my gun, I call that trap house clips
And I circle the block before I park my shit
Cause a opp can't catch me lacking tryna park my whip
And your bitch, she a eater
She just swallowed my kids
And every gun I get
Hollow tips up in my clip
Got your bitch with the shit
Taking trips with the bricks
Got your bitch with the shit
Taking trips with the bricks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Mouse]
Trap house booming it's a God damn shame
My lil niggas savages
They'll clap you out the range
I'm from 119
MBB you know my gang
Me and Fredo in the trap
Serving all these J's
Trap house booming
Nigga all I do is whip
A opp can't catch me lacking
I keep 30 in the clip
Please don't call my phone unless you're calling for a brick
And when I pull up
Bitches in the foreign whip
Juggin' on the plug
All my niggas know finesse
30 and a 40 and a 100 in the tech
And if you try to run
450 in his back
And if you're looking for me
You can catch me in the trap

[Hook]
