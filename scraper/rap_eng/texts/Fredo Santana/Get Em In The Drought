[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Tell you niggas keep my name out your mouth (out your mouth)
‘Fore I have them guys run up in your house (run up in your house)
I’m still selling cocaine in the drought (cocaine)
Whipping birds and I get ‘em from the south
I-95 hot, need another route
That bitch wanna pick she just need some clout
Police hit my spot need another house (the fuck)
Get them birds coming in and they coming out

[Verse 1: Capo]
Tell fuck niggas keep my name out your mouth
Before Cap have them guys run up in your house
When it’s a drought, my niggas tote 30s when it’s a drought
And if your trap is way too hot I’ll need another route
She want a picture with me and Fredo, she just want some clout (can’t get no clout)
You and your boyfriend belong together, both of y’all thirsty for the clout (thirsty for the clout)
And we ain’t giving y’all that (nah, nah)
And nigga wanna play monkey, ain't feed him bananas I feed him straps
And when you go to streets all alone by yourself pussy watch yo back
And when it come to selling half a brick selling wholes better know your math
Don't get your dumb ass finessed
And everybody go hopping out black vans with the tecs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shorty Six]
8 for key, he want a 8 for key
You talking anything less get away from me (get away from me)
Migo parked down the street I tell him wait for me
He 'bout to drop me 8 I only gotta pay for 3 (love)
Should I sell 'em whole or break 'em down? (break 'em down)
Should I pay him back or take him down? (get down nigga)
Get it white, teal, gray or brown (how ever you want it nigga)
Shake up the dope, then I’m shaking town
Move this shit to Wisconsin, samples give me sponsors
Kill a nigga on the spot, if he tricking I ain’t got no conscience (knock his shit back)
I’ll even honor your honor
I only love money, shit, I’m just being honest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Get them birds coming in and they coming out (birds)
Big boss Fredo, nigga I don’t see a drought (never)
Police hit my trap need another house (what)
Just smoked a whole zip need another ounce (zip)
Bricks in the ceiling, AR in the couch
Bitch wanna fuck, I only want her mouth (top)
Soon as she giving me the top I gotta put her out (she gotta go man)
If you ain’t making me no money ain’t no staying around (no)
Say it’s fuck a bitch, I never trust a bitch
You know I’m cold hearted, I never love a bitch (no)
Man fuck these niggas, they all fuck niggas (fuck niggas)
If you ain’t getting no money I can’t fuck with ya

[Hook]
