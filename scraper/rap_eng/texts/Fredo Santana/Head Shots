[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
We play with choppers, boy, don't get wet up (wet up)
And I'm looking at you broke boys, get your check up (Damn)
And you looking kinda shitty, get ya flex up (Yo flex up)

We play with choppers, boy, don't get wet up (wet up)

[Verse 2: Gino Marley]
Head shots, you can keep them chest shots
AKs, handguns, they all come with red dots
Gun on me now, ain't got time for no stash spot
Drought season now got me sellin' all this wet rock
Head shots, it ain't me, then you do leg shots (?)
Paper cuts from countin' this cash, that's what my hands got
Head shots from fucking around, that's what your mans got
All this money from hugging the trap, that's where my head at
Savage squad, we the squad, you can't claim that
Front street is where I'm from and where I hang at
Savage squad, we the squad, you can't claim that
Front street head shots is what I aim at
