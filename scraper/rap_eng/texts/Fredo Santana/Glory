[Hook: King Louie x2]
Everyday I'm fly, I'm on my glory shit
L-V double G, I'm on my glory shit
No top on the Porsche, I'm on my foreign shit
Amen to the man for this glory shit

[Verse 1: King Louie]
I should be a pastor, I'm so glorious
Dirty soda gone, pour another six
Foreign thots and drops, my life is glamorous
50 for a smile, stupid bands lil bitch
I know my money coming cause my hand it itch
MUBU Gang, GBE, God damn we rich
They love me and crew, next candidate
Steady getting money and we spend it quick
Bands on top of bands
Shawty do the team, only got one chance
I'ma blow it all cause I got more bands
Gotta do us all, bitch I got mo' friends
Niggas be broke, ain't got no ends
Shawty give me head for a new sew in
Car full of musk cu' I'm smoking
Gotta say grace cuz' I'm eating

[Hook: King Louie x2]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Broke niggas keep hating
Get money my occupation
GBE what I'm claiming
That .30 what I'm aiming
Get off my dick, I'm famous
Tell every bitch I made it
That money shit, yeah I got it
Them bands stay in my pocket
Get money like I supposed to
Jealous niggas all emotional
Big gun it don't fit me
This money too loud I don't hear you
Trues hanging off my ass
I don't look at tags
I see it, I want it, I buy it
Fuck with me it's toe tags
I-I-I-I-I love getting cash
Your bitch, she love my swag (x2)
Niggas broke they mad
It ain't my faulty you broke
I love smoking dope
Foreign bitch gimme throat

[Hook: King Louie x2]
