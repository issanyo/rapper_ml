[Hook]
Long nights in the trap tryna get my bands up
Pop a flat ain't no sleep I gotta got my bands up
Plug hit me with a sack so I got my mans up
All this white that I trap I gotta get my bands up

[Verse 1: JuiceDaSavage]
Imma dope boy nigga that's a trapaholic
On my grind everyday so whatchu call it?
Trap doing numbers so I be ballin
Got plays for the fiends so they be callin
2 for 10 Sundays and they be coming
Fell in love with trappin cus I was gettin money
Gotta switch my number cus they tryna get me
But I'm to smart for em so they can' trick me
10 racks up in my jeans I be straight swaggin
Rollin all night lurkin tryna get this money
Republican hit my line say he stay dumpin
Caper boy say whats up he tryna hit a caper
I told em line that shit up cus that shit ain't major
At the end of the night I gotta get this paper
At the end of the night I hit em with the vapor
At the end of the night I gotta get my bands up

[Hook]

Trap boy Trap boy
