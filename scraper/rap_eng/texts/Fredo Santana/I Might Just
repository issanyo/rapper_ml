[Hook: Fredo Santana]
My whip game proper, got me getting all these extras
You ain't flexin boy, man I think you need some lessons
Flexing on these niggas like a motherfuckin wrestler
Got a couple leans plugs, in Cali, up in Texas
Might just pull up, smoking marijuana
Might just give your bitch back when I wanna
Might just fuck it, just flex on everybody (FLEX)
Might just fuck it, just catch me a body!

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
I might just go in your baby mama raw dog
I might just text every bitch up in my call log
I might let you claim the baby, knowing that its not yours
I might just rob for your cash and say its not yours (Gimme that)
Ain't no telling what the fuck I might do. (Might do)
Got some killers with me and they might shoot. (Might shoot)
I stay with some low down dirty mafuckas
They stay with some 30s and they don't even fuck with mafuckas
I heard you holding on the low. (Holdin on the low)
Niggas say they savage but they really be hoes
Bitches be average need to play they fuckin role
Get some top from a thot then you know I gotta go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
I might smoke this whole pound, I might not sell this sack though
I might fuck your wifey, might not give her ass back though
I might hit up a caper,an run up in your trap man
I might pull this 30 and knock you off the map man. (Bang, bang)
Pull up on the block in a white coupe (Skrtt)
Fredo with me, off it and he might shoot (Bang)
Heard you kick it wit the opps, We don't like you
I'm a shoot you with this Glock, show you what this pipe do. (Bang)
Niggas said what? Your life through
Sneak dissin in the morning, get your night through
A fuckin AK what I might use. Or I might use the 30 and give you Michael
