If I Don't You Today Ima Getcho Ass Tomorrow, Niggas Tryna Hide But Can't Run From Dem Hollows,
Shout out To My Plug Man Shout out To My Vatos
Yeah They Speak My Lingo Get It For Da Cheap Doe
I Get It For The Cheap Doe I Get It For The Cheap Doe
I Get It For The Cheap Doe  I Get It For The Cheap Doe

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
I Get It For The Cheap Doe,
Selling Work Out My Back Door,
Dame Who This At My Front Door
Don't Make Me Shoot Out The Peephole,
In The Trap Moving Kilos
Got Chips Like Fritos
Got Gwap Like Casinos
Got Shooters Shoot For Free Doe
Some My Bitchs Call Me Freedo
Lame Niggas Ain't With Me Doe
Been A Hustla Since A Snotty Nose
Try Me And Im Poping Folks
Knock His Shit Down Like Dominoes
Been A Leader Never Follow Folks
Get The Spraying Like A Water Holes

[Hook: Fredo Santana]

[Verse 2: Gino Marley]
I Get This Hustle From My People
You Don't Understand A Kilo?
Trap Spots That's Just Me Doe
Quick Cash I Get Sloppy Dough
Get To Shooting Now He Sloppy Joe
Some You Nigga Play The Papa Role
Hood Bitchs Play The Pop It Role
In The Kitchen I Just Use The Stove
And My Plug Call Me Gino, But My Clients Say Diego,
Big Blunts Big As Eggrolls
See Work Like I'm Pablo
Kill His Ass With No Sorrow
Be Here Today And Back Tomorrow
Water Whipping With The Pots Full
