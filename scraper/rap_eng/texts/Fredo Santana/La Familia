[Hook: Fredo]
No new niggas in my eyes we don't fuck with strangers
Pull them pistols out, and just get to aiming
My lil niggas dangerous, bond out on probation
But still toting them bangers, we leave you brainless
We love gang banging, you niggas is basic
My time, don't waste it!
That money, I chase it!
I'm counting them faces, in love with Ben Franklins
No patience, no waiting, I'm chasing that paper!

[Verse: Ballout]
I'm counting them faces, I'm shooting them faces
Capture us overseas, I don't do the same places
Switch up the location, while the guys are on payments
No, I am not on papers, ball on, just handle cables!
Free cables, we do cables
No ballout, don't do favors
I smoke dope I be facing
Getting so high I can taste it!
They ain't real, they're faking
300, we done made it O'block affiliated
Got all these niggas hating

[Hook: Fredo]

[Verse: Fredo]
I'm chasing that paper
You got it, I take it
On the block with the guys, my trap going so crazy
These niggas sons, I call em my babies
Tek 9s, .380s, shoot you I let you taste it
Yellow bones my favorite!
I love fucking their faces
I do it so major
What? I'm counting that paper!
My fingers is aching, I'm counting that paper!
I'm balling like the Pacers, these niggas is bitches
I tell it to their faces!

[Hook: Fredo]

[Verse: Gino]
That money, I chase it
Impatient, no waiting
I thumb through them faces
No masses, bare faces
I drive cars like speed racer, fuck bitches that be famous
Get cash my ocupation
I spend it and save it
My pants just full of Franklins
Bad bitches none them basic
Money thoughts all I'm thinking
Drive work round in that Lincoln
Sip lean so I've been drinking
That molly got her spacing
My foreign plug Jamaican
I chase it, no waiting!
