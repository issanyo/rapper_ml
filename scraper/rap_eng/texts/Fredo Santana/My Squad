[Verse 2: Frenchie]

Three hundred pistols, equal three hundred triggers (squad)
I never run, I'm too gutta' son

If you fall get up, better yet just stay down
Bang bang, what the g's say, with the Glock it's outta sight
A fuck nigga, that's the shit I don't like
Got a [?], got a big chain and a long 'K'
A sniper rifle in the thirty-thirty I'm dirty dirty nigga all day, for real
Yeah, she wanna chill with Frenchie, but not everyday (fuck her)
That's OK, I got another chick on the way
