[Intro:]
Turn up the motherfuckin' audio nigga
DJ screamin', know what the fuck I do
My niggas hood rich kings, and DJ Bangs
We present to the motherfucking universe
Fredo Santana, walking legend

[Hook:]
Young nigga flexin' cause the check came in
Finna buy some new weapons cause the check came in
Might buy a Benz cause the check came in
Finna fuck your girlfriend cause the check came in
The check came in, the check came in
See a nigga stunt cause the check came in
The check came in, the check came in
Finna roll me up a blunt cause the check came in

[Verse 1:]
Check came in so a young nigga flexin'
Coulda bought a house but instead I bought some weapons
Should I buy some bricks, shit that is not a question
Finna fuck your bitch then I might buy her a necklace
Stay up in your lane boy, that is my suggestion
Before you be stretched out in a new section
Popping bottles in my section with bitches I be textin'
One night these hoes gone loves these hoes, Fredo keep it pimpin'
In Chicago in my condo gettin' top from plenty women
In the kitchen with the fort, yea, I'm makin' trap decisions
One hand with the Glock, man you know I handle business
Trapped out in my trap spot, I can show you how I'm livin'

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
And that's just the intro
Front Street Street Savage squad shit
My nigga big boss Fredo
DJ Lil Keem what up
It's the Hood Rich-Savage Squad connection
