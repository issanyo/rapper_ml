[Hook: Fredo Santana]
I used to sell dimes on the third floor
Now I got bricks by the boat load
I used to sell work by the corner store
Now I can buy that damn corner store
Niggas used to front me fucking packs of shit
Now I got crack like it's '86
And I ain't just jumped off the fucking porch
If you want war we can go to war

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Thirty shots or better in my handgun
Nigga we play for keeps, we don't shoot for fun
Them bullets hot like the sun, you better run
Hit you with this forty and shoot you with this tommy gun
The world is mine, I'm looking like Tony son
Fuck a bad bitch, I need a couple of 'em
El Chapo with the work, I'm mister double up
Vatos hit me up, he need a hundred of 'em
You know me shit, I tried to fucking smuggle 'em
I got couple guns with a hundred drums
So when a nigga ain't done, this ain't one of 'em
A couple thou' sitting in my shoe box
And I'm so thug life, call me 2Pac
A nigga robbed you and you ain't do nothing

And I ain't just jumped off the fucking porch

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
Trappin' out the bando since a fucking youngin'
Ran into lil' Fredo, had to fuck with youngin'
Serving O.J. Mayo, 80' crack one hundred
Quick to make that cake, ol' fuck nigga ain't my mama
Fuck Twelve, pussy nigga, talking to your honor
A young nigga been out the porch fucking with drugs, serving President Obama
All of my pockets are filled up with dope, the bird, that's still in the bunker
Don't need your favor, I juug every summer
Start I used to trap in now I own it
Rolling pharmacy on four or five commas
I got the bands of O.G. marijuana
They asking about me all in Tijuana
I ate a baby who gone keep it one hunna'
You think I'm Chiraq when you play with my money
I smoke a pack, you say you be coming
I'm back to back and ?
? young nigga drumming that used ?? get you gunning
Talk to 'em Fredo
