[Intro]
Lets get it
Squad
Fuck the other side

[Hook]
I'ma spazz on you niggas, I say fuck the other side
Keep playing with a check, getting money 'till I die
So much pain inside, but it's so hard for me to cry
I done gained a lotta money but I done lost a lotta guys
I say fuck the other side (x4)
I'ma spaz on you niggas
I say fuck the other side (x3)

[Verse 1]
I'ma pull up on yo' block, I'ma fuckin' drop some
Niggas better pray to God, better hope the cops come
Got a 40, Juice got a 30, Caper got a drum
It's gon' be a bloody scene, man you don't want none
I'ma spazz on you niggas, I say fuck the other side
I'ma pull up on blocks kill sons, mamas cry
And it's fucked up in the streets
I sell drugs, they wonder why
Lookin' for the lean, man I'm just tryna get high
Heard these niggas sneak diss, don't make me pull a drive-by
Reese roll the window down I'm finna blow this 4-5
And this bitch text my phone, I swear I hope her friend bi
Finna cake her out and get some top and tell that bitch bye

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In the kitchen whippin' chickens like I work for Popeyes
You can get it for a low number just hit my line
And this club going down, but yet my money flyin'
If a nigga put they hands on me I swear they dyin'
And we keep guns on us, boy we don't knuckle up
Lemme call my plug, think it's time to re-up
And these niggas fake as fuck, only money I trust
So much money coming in, man, I can't get enough
And this loud that I'm smokin' man I got it from Jamaica
Run up on me wrong, boy, I'ma fuckin' have to face ya
All this fuckin' fool talk, man I ain't got no patience
What you want, what you need, serve yo' ass like a waiter

[Hook]
