[Intro]
Playing with a sack (x2)
Im playing with a sack

[Hook]
I can have any bitch I want, im playing with a sack
Do what I want, bitch im playing with a sack
Spend it get it back, I just do it like that
But it ain't really nothing when you playing with a sack
Got alot of money bitch, im playing with a sack
20s, 50s, 100s man, im playing with a sack
Bank account got commas bitch, im playing with a sack
I ain't worried bout nothin cuz im playing with a sack

[Verse 1]
I ain't worried bout shit cuz im playing with a sack
Coolin in the trap, just playing with my strap
Watching out for feds, I ain't tryna get snatched
GBE the squad, forever got my back
You gotta watch these hoes, cuz I swear these hoes thirsty
You gotta watch these niggas, cuz they ain't trustworthy
And I ain't finna serve you cuz you look like the police
Ballin on these bitches, Micheal Jordan or Kobe
A bitch dont want to fuck, then she gotta get out
I ain't wanna fuck, I just want to fuck your mouth
A bitch ain't want to fuck, then she gotta get out
I ain't wanna fuck bitch, I only want your mouth

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ain't worried bout shit nigga, I got money on my back
But if i go broke im gonna bring out that math
10 for a feature, 25 for a half
I got that straight drop, make they ass come back
They say money ain't everything but it sure give me everything
Im in love with this money, I swear I need a wedding ring
Spend it on myself man, these hoes dont get a damn thing
Sippin codeine, in traffic in the fast lane
When I touch your city just tell me where the dope at
I fuck with real niggas, fuck with me you get a toe tag
These bitches ain't shit but you probably already know that
I just left miami but im probably finna go back

[Hook]
