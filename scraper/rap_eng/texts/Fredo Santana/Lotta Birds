[Hook: Gino Marley]
Lotta birds in my view
Trap spot, got them pigeons flying loose
Shit exotic like the zoo
Pop 4, stuffing pigeons in my coupe
Birds (birds), Birds (birds)
Birds (birds), Birds (birds), Birds
Lotta pigeons in my coupe
Trap spot, got them birds flying loose

[Verse 1: Gino Marley]
Lotta birds in my view
Dope spot, got them pigeons flying loose
And I stuff em in my coupe
In the kitchen, I just whip em 'til I'm through
Road trip, then I drive through the loop
Brick fair, bitch my pockets got the flu
Around these birds, bitch like Smokie in his coupe
Don't roll that window down, it’s smoky in my coupe
All my niggas round here, they trained to shoot
Let em search the whip, they gon do what they do
I stuff my pigeons in my floor and in my roof
And leave my window open, birds flying through

[Hook: Gino Marley]

[Verse 2: SD]
A lot of birds flying through
You see my pic you swear you seen me on the news
I got birds in my coupe (birds)
Try to blame me you gon force my man’s assault
Got the trap spot jumping like a zoo
You play with guns but is you really gonna shoot?
Bird talk, boy I finesse you out yo loop
And I smoke grade A, boyo is the crew
All my niggas round here but we ain’t average
If we can meet the plug, get it beat up tragic
If you ain’t got a gun boy don’t get embarrassed
You niggas feathers, I will always be a savage

[Hook: Gino Marley]

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
So much birds I might change my name to Birdman
So much cash money got me stuffed like Birdman
Once I sell these last 2 bricks I’mma take a trip to Berlin
And I don’t want that bitch unless she got a girlfriend
My guns got a girlfriend, girlfriend
And I be getting so high like the world finna end
And I be so damn fresh like I motherfuckin did
It’s 30 that I’m holdin, leave a motherfucker dead
These niggas broke as fuck, ain’t got no motherfuckin bread
I got birds in the ceiling, I got birds under my bed
So much birds in this bitch got me bird talking
I ain’t got no mo birds, now I’m bird shoppin

(Hook)
Lotta birds in my view
Trap spot, got them pigeons flying loose
Shit exotic like the zoo
Pop 4, stuff them pigeons in them coupes
Birds (birds), Birds (birds)
Birds (birds), Birds (birds), Birds
Lotta pigeons in my coupe
Trap spot, got them birds flying loose
