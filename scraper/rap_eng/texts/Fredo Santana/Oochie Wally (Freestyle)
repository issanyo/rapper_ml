[Freestyle: Fredo Santana]
Beefing with me, shit, you better beef with other niggas
I got shooters that got shooters and they be shooting niggas
I can look at your swag and tell that you losing nigga
I can front your work, depend on what you moving nigga
And baby, it ain’t just me, I got a group of niggas
You can get the fuck out, if you ain’t trying do my niggas
Oh, 30 popper turning real niggas, hallelujah, nigga
Got my gun, try to rob me, I love shooting niggas
Grab the popcorn ‘cause it can be a movie nigga
Don’t make me pull up, hop out with that Uzi nigga
Real gangsta rapper, I’m not like these fool niggas
Voices in my head like, "Fredo, you the truth nigga!"
Up in my own lane, don’t compare me to fool niggas
Loyalty over everything, trying to get my crew with ya
Doing hits, by myself, no telling, who snitching
Rap don’t work then someone’s jewels missing
That don’t work then, back to the kitchen
Got a thousand hoes but I’m trying to get more bitches
Got a lot of money but I’m trying to get more richer
Paperboy with me and we trying to catch you slipping
Niggas say they with it but they is not with it
Niggas say they winning but they is not winning
These niggas see-through just like new linen
These niggas haters, pockets full of big Benjies
See these niggas faces when I pull up with new Benzes
Can't wait to see these niggas faces when I pull up in new Benzes
Street nigga, I am not a rapper
Cooling in the trap workout the wrapper
Sneak dissing I’ma have to clap it
Bitch suck me without me asking
Pimp strong, L-O-L but I ain’t laughing (Hahaha)
45 on me, nah, I ain’t lacking
See me in the streets it can get tragic
Young trap king, five bricks in the mattress
Young Hefner, five bitches in the mansion
Might fuck ‘em, suck ‘em up ‘cause a nigga nasty
