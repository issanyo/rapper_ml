[Hook: Quavo]
Ice on my neck, scary Freddy Kruger
Pull out the Ruger PAW, Freddy Kruger
Snatch a nigga in his dreams, Freddy Kruger
Black Maybach, call it Freddy Kruger
Freddy Kruger, Freddy Kruger
Ice on my neck, scary Freddy Kruger
Freddy Kruger, Freddy Kruger
Black Maybach, call it Freddy Kruger

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Fredo, yeah we get peso, live my life 300
Pull up, Freddy Kruger, choppa, GLAW, we hold 100
If you walk around with that set my niggas they gonn' want it
Young niggas in the hood, they be snatching that pack and runnin'
Hit 'em in the stomach, don't say nothing
When you in the trap man it's always something
Choppa start dumpin', best to start runnin'
Ain't none to hit 'em & it ain't none but some money
Wanna be a boss, better earn your stripes
If you scared go to bed at night
My niggas ain't scared to loose rights
I put 'em on your head like lice

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Pop up out the cut, it's Fredo "fucking" Kruger
Pop up out the cut with that motherfucking Ruger
Bitch I'm a shooter, I don't need no shootie, bang
Nigga you's a looser, my wrist and neck is cooler
Your bitch she's a chooser, I swear my life a movie
4 bitches and a jacuzzi, rolling swishers, no doobies
Your bitch she's a chooser, I swear my life a movie
4 bitches and a jacuzzi, rolling swishers, no doobies
Let's get it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Black Maybach real scary
Talkin that cheese, like Tom And Jerry
Bitch jaw break'em, Ed Edd and Eddy
Dream about me, real scary like Freddy
In the cap runnin up me and Fredo
Pockets on cheese, alfredo, call up Tadoe
Put a hundred bands on your potato
I get the pack straight from Barbados
I got blocks, ain't talking about Legos
Leggo my eggo, you ain't got a bankroll
You ain't talkin pesos then this is finito
Tryna make it flip, like Finding Nemo
At the bando looking through the peep hole
Selling that dope call me Rico
Then get enough, flip the whole kilo
