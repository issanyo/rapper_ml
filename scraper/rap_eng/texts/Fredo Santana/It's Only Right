[Hook]
It's only right x4
That I pull up with your bitches
It's only right
That I move fucking bricks
It's only right
Got all these bitches on my dick
It's only right
That I move [?]
It's only right x4
That I flex with all this [?]
It's only right
I'm the mother fucking man
It's only right x3

[Verse 1]
It's only right
I had a threesome off them xans
Don't know them hoes' names
But I know just who they is
It's only right
That I stack all this cash
[?]
It's only right
That I turn up on you niggas
And I turn up on your bitches
Don't give a fuck about your feelings
It's only right
That I keep my circle closed
And stay away from fuck niggas
I can't trust a soul
It's only right
That I keep my gun on me
RIP the guys
Man I miss J Money
It's only right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's only right
That me and my niggas stay loyal
It's only right
If you wanna [streaze?] get a lawyer
Bitches ain't shit
I put my niggas way before them
Call that ho your wife
But she over [?]
It's only right x2
I ride my niggas
Right or wrong
It's only right x2
I got like two or three holmes
And 25 foes
And 89 hoes
And when I'm in Miami
I be cooling with the [zol?]
It's only right
That I stay a real nigga
It's only right
That I keep my pistol
(Right)
That I handle my business
(Right)
It's only right x2

[Hook]
It's only right x11
