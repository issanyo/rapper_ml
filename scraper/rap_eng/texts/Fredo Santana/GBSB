[Hook: Fat Trel & Chief Keef]
Bitch I'm rolling with my niggas and we smoking dope
First first I lock it and load, run up on him with the scope
If if if if you ain't gettin shot, then you're getting poked
GBSB money on the floor

If you ain't gettin shot, then you're gettin poked
Fredo want the dope, Tadoe want the dope

[Verse 1:Fat Trel]
