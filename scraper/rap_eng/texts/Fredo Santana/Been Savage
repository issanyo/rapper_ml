[Chorus]
Street nigga don't need a rap deal
I can show you how the trap feel
Nigga say that he want beef
I'ma show him how that MAC feel
Disrepect the gang, you get killed, that's what's happening
Funeral service, mom was crying, shit tragic
Everywhere I go, you know Fredo pistol packing
Shoot a nigga in public, fuck it I been savage
You's a fucking dork, I been savage
You just jumped off the porch, I been savage

[Verse]
Caught my first case, shit I was only twelve
How you twenty-five, man you tryna jump in the field
Spent my fifteenth, seventeenth birthday when I was in jail
I'm from 061 Front Street, all my niggas real
I'm from Chiraq shit, where you can get killed
I remember long nights when I ain't have a meal
Still trappin', fuck this rap shit, I don't need no deal
Triple OG, yeah they know, respected in this field
2006 when I first start poppin' pills
Listen to that Gucci with a bad bitch and an Uzi
Now I'm eating sushi with a bad bitch, I hit the movements
Feet up in Cali but you know I got my tooly

[Chorus]
Street nigga don't need a rap deal
I can show you how the trap feel
Nigga say that he want beef
I'ma show him how that MAC feel
Disrespect the gang, you get killed, that's what's happening
Funeral service, mom was crying, shit tragic
Everywhere I go, you know Fredo pistol packing
Shoot a nigga in public, fuck it I been savage
You's a fucking dork, I been savage
You just jumped off the porch, I been savage
