[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Real street nigga
Nothing more and nothing less
If I go broke I'm robbing everybody else
Fuck a bitch and hit the door
A hundred dollars on his head
Them killers comin' right at you
So please don't get left
.30s wit' beams on em
Man please watch your step
Only want the top baby girl, I don't want no sex
Only aim for tops, so fuck nigga fuck yo vest
Only hang wit' 300, so fuck nigga fuck yo set
And I only carry choppas, no hand guns so don't get wet
And we don't go by rules, you can call us young diplomats
And I been sellin' crack ever since i use to flip on mats
Lookin out for cops, in the grass I use to stash my packs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Out here sellin' every brick for cheap nigga
What you want we in the muhfuckin' streets nigga
Whippin' up pies, I don't fuck with weed nigga
In the hood I'm the fuckin' trick or treat nigga
All the junkies in the hood fuck with me nigga
They even fuckin' wash my car for free nigga
Sometimes I give bags out for the free nigga
Only if you only work with me nigga
I'm a boss nigga, I don't fuck with cheap niggas
In the kitchen cookin' chickens smokin' Keisha
Or in traffic in that fuckin' Beamer
'Member when we used to fuckin steal steamers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gino]
Street nigga everyday in the streets nigga
Free work so we let it go for cheap nigga
Never played the crib always in the streets nigga
Got bags off and under my eyes no sleep nigga
Plug got it but he only trustin' me nigga
Left my yams at folks crib its just some weed nigga
Whole life changed when I started using dishes
Whole life changed my uncle taught me how to whip it
But you gotta do it right its all in the mixing
Most my nights I spent up posted in the kitchen
But you gotta do it right its all in the mixing
Most my nights I spent up water whippin'

[Hook]
