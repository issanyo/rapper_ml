Fredo making music that them real traps trap to
Fredo making music that them real killers kill to
How Fredo a rapper and he say he in the field too
Dare a nigga try me, pussy nigga I will kill you
Kill you, kill you, kill you
Wish a nigga would try me, I will kill you
Kill you, kill you, kill you, kill you
Let a nigga try me, pussy nigga I will kill you

[Verse]
Got my shooters in the trap, that’s who I give my packs to
30s all around and we a squeeze if we have to
My plug call my phone I’m just praying he get them packs through
It’s a drought in your town you know I’m finna tax you
Wanna be famous make your block name it after you
Niggas never do what they say that they gon do
I’m the CEO, I signed myself
Headed to the top, don’t need no help
Let my pants sag, don’t need no belt
Cook my own dope, don’t need no chef
Thinking to myself like, Self you shitting on everybody else
Fredo Al Capone I got handguns bigger than a elf
Macho Man Randy Savage flexing like it’s my last day here
Trapping like a trap-a-thon, MVP of the year
