My trap it be coming with issues gotta keep swishers and pistols
If a stain coming down with that issue my niggas letting off missles
For the right price young max god will kill you money is so beneficial
My trap it be coming with issues gotta keep swishers and pistols
These little niggas say they want issues pull up with swishers and pistols
Nigga go check my cridentials blowing on swishers and pistols
This little bitch she got some potential blow me like swishers and pistols
My trap it be coming with issues gotta keep swishers and pistols

[Verse 1: Maxo Kream]
It's mister shoot gats back to back like Kobe Shaq
Flip a pack it's coming back like boomerang's in cul-de-sac
So action packed my gun intact
Put hollows where his kidneys at
Front me work don't pay it back
Like Rosa Parks don't play the back
On Forum Park, I keep the strap
Beyond the arc I'm back to back
Larry Allen Ray Bird thats mix and match
Got pounds of weed Lil' P got crack
Not using fists my choppa clap
If the bitch talk back then the bitch get smacked
Got golden grill no t will plaque
Its Hoover gang don't need a flag
My niggas split bread like gensu money is never an issue
Play with me your momma gone miss you have that bitch crying in tissues
Keep .30 extensions on pistols suppressors no sound when it hit you
Your bitch blew the crew like a whistle then she came back and she kissed you

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
All facts when I rap on the track these niggas tellin' lies
I ain't gotta rap where my trap I be sellin' pies
Cocaine ecstasy molly I can serve ya ass
5 bricks in my closet came a long way from sellin' bags
These niggas be walkin' round like they tough but softer then tissue
Headshot faceshot leave 'em on the ground now his family gone miss 'em
Ya bitch be suckin' my dick, I'm gripping all on her nipple
A nigga tried to rob me hell nah nigga I keep me a nickel
Mr keep the thrax play with me you gettin' wacked

Last night was a good day bought 30k up off my traps

[Verse 3: Maxo Kream]
Trap house strapped eatin' noodles
At the table counting money with my shooters
Got 30's on Glocks and rugers
Still groovin' bitch its 5 duece Hoover
Still $1,200 for the whole cruzer
Still do a drive by in the Uber
Head band but I'm not a fuckin' hooper
We trap big well mine a lil huger
Hit 'em with the 30 popper bullets jumpin' grasshopper
Parked around the corner yeah you know my lil crips got 'em
Drinking marijuana going fed just to make a profit
Bodies dropping price dropping need a pint you know I got it
Call me when you outside park by the fire hydrant
Serve 'em or rob 'em I'm sitting here deciding
Show his ass the work first let 'em go in his wallet
Hit his ass with the pistol then we go inside his pockets
(I'm Janky don't trust me)
Its no one no ones all my niggas is killin'
(We jumpin', we shootin')
You sweet honey bun with the extra cream filling
(You sweet nigga)
My niggas is pimping these boppers we callin' 'em dollars
My niggas be shootin' them choppas
Your niggas calling the copers
