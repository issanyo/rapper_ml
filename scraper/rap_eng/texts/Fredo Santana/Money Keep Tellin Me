My money too loud, I can't hear ya, homie
My money keep tellin' me, I'm shittin' on 'em
My money too loud, I can't hear ya, homie
My money like "Fredo, man you're shittin' on 'em"
I'm shittin' on 'em, I'm shittin' on 'em
I'm shittin' on 'em, I'm shittin' on 'em
My money too loud man, I'm shittin' on 'em
I'm shittin' on 'em, I'm shittin' on 'em
I'm shittin' on 'em, I'm shittin' on 'em
My money too loud man, I'm shittin' on 'em

[Verse]
Niggas fake as fuck, I don't trust niggas
Actin' like they real, but really fuck niggas
That's why I don't really fuck with niggas
Savage Squad Records, only us, nigga
Look at that Bob Marley, only thing I trust, nigga
Fucked your bitch, and she save me tongue, nigga
I swear that pussy wetter than a sponge, nigga
But I will never ever fall in love with her
Niggas just be talkin' cause they got lips on 'em
But I ain't worried 'bout shit, cause my guns got clips on 'em
Niggas broke as fuck while Fredo get rich on 'em
Bitches ain't shit, pull out my dick and piss on 'em
