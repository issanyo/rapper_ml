Fuck these bitches, let's get money! [x16]

Fuck these bitches, let's get money!
I keep that shit 3 hundred
I got all these comers coming
And nothing got me a bitch stunting
Fuck around all around drama
Then come back for his mama
Bullets hot like a sauna
SD so shit gonna
Pulling out we pouring out
Fact that we were my George out
Can't you see we're so serene
I think I'm bout to fall out
Shocking bit like I'm a make a ring
My main bitch run all out
I go by the more loud
And these kitty cats at my dog house
Stacking on my imap
Rude bitch out in chy rack
Making left from OTF
The old block make your show stop
SB from DC
I got extra grands for the lay low
Hotel with the money counting
Jay Low get Fredo

Fuck these bitches, let's get money! [x16]
