[Chorus]
I'm smokin' dope', I'm feeling good
Lot of money in my pocket, bitch I'm in the hood
Lot of killers with me, with a lot of guns
Lot of niggas with me, with a lot of drugs
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
Lot of killers with me, bitch I'm in the hood
Lot of killers with me, bitch I'm in the hood

[Verse]
Cory fuckin brink
Try to play me bitch, I let my gun jerk
I am not lame, I don't fuck with lames
Got a bad bitch, who just give me brain
We make bullets rain, bitch we insane
Serving all white, I'm talking cocaine
I fuck a lot of bitches, who got a fucking main
I fuck a lot of bitches, who got a fucking main

[Chorus]
I'm smokin' dope', I'm feeling good
Lot of money in my pocket, bitch I'm in the hood
Lot of killers with me, with a lot of guns
Lot of niggas with me, with a lot of drugs
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
I'm smokin' dope, I'm feeling good
Lot of killers with me, bitch I'm in the hood
Lot of killers with me, bitch I'm in the hood
