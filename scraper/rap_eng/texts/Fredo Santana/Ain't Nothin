[Hook]
My clip so long, but it ain't nothin'
Pull up in sumn stupid, but it ain't nothin'
Your bitch want me, but she ain't nothin'
I fuck first week, but it ain't nothin'
My plug got bricks like it ain't nothin'
So we don't wanna work like it ain't nothin'
Work on spendin' a hunnid like it ain't nothin'
Got a lotta money, but it ain't nothin'

[Verse]
Ball so hard, but it ain't nothin'
Feds watch me, but it ain't nothin'
Thots wanna flirt when I stunt in public
Keep shooters all around, but it ain't nothin'
Your girl don't come around unless she ain't fuckin'
My traps go berserk. but it ain't nothin'
I keep some work, just a young hustler
Don't call my phone 'less you a customer
My shooters on point, but it ain't nothin'
In the cut smokin' doink, but it ain't nothin'
All these bitches on my dick, but I ain't cuffin'
She just give me top, fuck her on the cupboard
Man that head so good, might thank her mother
Man that head so good, might thank her mother
Drivin' all foreign, all my shit custom
Couple headshot, last nigga touch me
If a nigga diss me, he ain't dead, he lucky
All my niggas in the field like we play for rugby
If a nigga diss me, he ain't dead, he lucky
All my niggas in the field like we play for rugby
