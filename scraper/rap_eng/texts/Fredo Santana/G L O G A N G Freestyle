[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I told Fredo pour that Act up (Act up)
And now my cup waxed up (waxed uuuup)
My bling so blinged up (blinged up)
That I can't even hear nuthin'
Pull up with them toys, I think I'm Santa
Bandana bitch, I think I'm Santana (aye)
Bandana on this mothafucking hammer
I hop out this mothafucka then I blam ya
Ya damn much

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
(?)
That .30, it'll do dirty
Leave you on the floor scratching

[Verse 3: Andy Milonakis]
Don't eat it if it smell like sushi (HAHAHAHA)
But I'ma eat that white shit (oh, damn!)
I'll fuck it all night, shit (aye)
I got that japanese pussy (bang)
Eat it with chopsticks
She say "let me get that cock sick"
I said "yo my flow hot, bitch"
I said I'm Andy Milonakis
I leave that (?)
When I fucked her, I mean't it

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
Ghetto, young and reckless
Bitches gloin' reckless
And talk shit, then it get hectic
You come from everywhere, you exit
Blood got me tweakin'
I swear blood got me geekin'
I swear blood got me blingin'
RIP Bloody Demon
