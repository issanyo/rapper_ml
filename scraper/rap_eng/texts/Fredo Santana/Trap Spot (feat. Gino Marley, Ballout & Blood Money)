[Chorus]
Bang, bang, powder on the scale, wanna come up
Ain't gonn tell you twice, gonn tell you once
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life
Wanna sail high, wanna be a star
Wanna fuck bitches, wanna drive cars? Foreign
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life
Trap life

[Verse 1]
I can introduce you to this trap life
In the trap, in the kitchen all we sell is white
In the hallway with them 30's we've been toll pipes
Better not be no fuckin opa, you gonn lose your life
We got niggas dying, niggas wailin, kill em for the set
Make you crazy, with the shit, you can get whacked
Hollow tips hit his brain, he won't remember that
Trapstars bitch, we fly where them pigeons at
Sell that phoney work damn that type of shit is whack
Went from sellin weed to pushin crack
5 hunned dollars round my waist niggas kill for that
5 hunned dollars get a nigga fuckin whacked

[Chorus]
Bang, bang, powder on the scale, wanna come up
Ain't gonn tell you twice, gonn tell you once
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life
Wanna sail high, wanna be a star
Wanna fuck bitches, wanna drive cars? Foreign
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life

[Verse 2]
I can introduce you to this trap life
Lil niggas in the kitchen, whippin white
Better shoot 30's if they don't look white
Gotta watch faces in this trap life
Niggas cops, niggas snitches, niggas tellin lies
I don't trust niggas, get em out my sight
They be acting, like they down alright
When the cops catch em, they be out the same night
See that's the crazy shit, about this trap life
Niggas say they trappin, but they ain't trappin right
These niggas tellin lies, my niggas sellin pies
I told you I can introduce you to this trap life

[Chorus]
Powder on the scale, wanna come up
Ain't gonn tell you twice, gonn tell you once
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life
Wanna sail high, wanna be a star
Wanna fuck bitches, wanna drive cars? Foreign
I can introduce you to this trap life
I can introduce you to this trap life
