[Intro]
808 Mafia

[Hook: Ballout]
Been ballin', I'm a glo boy
Too many whips, too many cribs, I got a lot to show for it
Traphouse vacant, only pots and forks out, I whip coke boy
Your favorite rapper is a MC Gusto CB4 boy
Chicago Kingpin, most wanted Cali dopeboy
Ferrari Spider crawlin', I'm so fuckin down to earth boy
Burnin' broccoli up out the 'wood, drinkin purp boy
I'm a glo boss, all these niggas wanna work boy

[Verse 1: Tadoe]
(GANG)
Pull up, like beep beep
I'm slammin' that Chief Keef
Yo thot wanna freak me
Heard I was in knee deep
Ride off, like skurt skurt
Ride beamers, no steamers
Got your girl, have you seen her?
My watch is blinged up
Gettin' guap, them bands up
Gettin' top while I stand up
Trynna rob, get fanned up
Get popped, no Fanta
We crackin', no scammers
Tote Glocks, no jammer
You tweak, get blammed up
Goku, go hammer
(You know how we rockin and rollin and how the fuck we bleed man)
(Smokin' out the 448 man to the face man)
(Smokin' woods back to back man)
(Automatic sack man, we invented that)

[Verse 2: Ballout]
Been ballin y'all some broke boys
Got mansion out in cali, got grim chiraq on the low boy
Too many chains, too many rings, I walk 'round like a dope boy
Solid foundations, built from ground, I'm a glo boy
Mansion in the hills, used to sleep up on the floor boy
To get what you want, all you gotta do is work for it
New big body, your bitch said it feel like a surfboard
I done bossed up, look all these niggas wanna work boy
Your favourite rapper died his hair, lookin like a jerk boy
I got so many bands, looking like a clerk boy
I'm ridin' around fully loaded, my engine got that work boy
Everybody know me in the hood, ballout serve boys
Foreigns pull up and hurt boys

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Ballout ridin' them beamers
I done split my lean cup (slow down boss)
Look around, all these rappers, damn, they wanna be us
20 grand blue hunnids, damn, just to see us
Balmain saggin' over my loafers, nigga keep up
Brand new Tec, brand new K
I just murked a nigga, and I bought this shit today
I just murked a nigga, got blood on my face
I just murked a nigga, let me put this gun away
Brand new toolies, brand new uzi
When I pull up, get to shootin' like a movie
300 Glo Gang Savage Squad, that's the movement
If we ain't gettin' money, pussy nigga is you stupid?
