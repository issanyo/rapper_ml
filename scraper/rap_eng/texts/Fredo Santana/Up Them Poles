[Hook: Fredo Santana]
See Fredo be that nigga, just to let you niggas know
Fuck these bitches fuck these ho's see my money come first
Have my youngins kick the door lay you on the floor
For that bag for that money you ain't got it? gotta go
See that kush is what I smoke
You want beef? you get smoked
See you bitch she a slut she just suck and hit the door
I'm that nigga, thought you know
You ain't know that now you know
If we stack we up them poles
If we stack we up them poles

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
You turned down I'm turned up
Play with me you get burned up
My whole team got thirtees
2 keys for the forty
Smokin dope got me coughing
Play with me you in a coffin
I don't fuck around with no goofy niggas
Them niggas belong in the circus
I wish a nigga would put they hands on me
I bet he won't never see his damn family
Cause all my niggas they killas
Savage life I'm living
I'm out here drugdealing
Just tryi'n to make a living
Big ass crib but I only use the kitchen
I don't trust niggas they snitching tripping over this bitches
Bitches lovin' my pimpins
Fuck a bitch get missin'
I'm with the shit and you isn't
So stop all that pretending

[Hook]
See Fredo be that nigga, just to let you niggas know
Fuck these bitches fuck these ho's see my money come first
Have my youngins kick the door lay you on the floor
For that bag for that money you ain't got it? gotta go
See that kush is what I smoke
You want beef? you get smoked
See you bitch she a slut she just suck and hit the door
I'm that nigga, thought you know
You ain't know that now you know
If we stack we up them poles
If we stack we up them poles


[Verse 2: Ballout]
If we stack we up them poles Fourty to his nose
I got gold you ain't know
Bitch I got rolls
Ridinin' on forgiatos Stunt on them ho's
Been with it from the go
3hundred all I know
Smoking dope rollin stank
Tryin' hit a stain
If he gotta kick his door Fredo gone blow
With ya'll don't know
All is gone blow
Lot of guns gun-show
I swear this niggas hoes
Out here on the block
Bitches swear we dunkin opps
Bitch we selling rocks
On tha block tote Glocks Glocks
So please don't get shot
So please don't get shot
For we put you in da box
For we put you in da box
