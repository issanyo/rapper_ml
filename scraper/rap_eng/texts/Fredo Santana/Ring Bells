[Intro]
My name ring bells
Got a lot of money cause my name ring bells
My name ring bells


[Hook]
I finesse the plug cause my name ring bells
All I do is juug cause my name ring bells
All these bitches on me cause my name ring bells
Got a lot of money cause my name ring bells
My name ring bells
My name ring bells
My name ring bells
Got a lot of money cause my name ring bells

[Verse 1]
Every time I fuck my bitch you know that bitch yells
I'm getting inside her soul and she scratch me with her nails
City to city you know my name ring bells
But if you try to rob me, know I'm sending shells
I send a nigga to hell, pussy ass nigga you look like you gon' tell
Eyeball work nigga, I don't need no scale
Free all the guys, hope they get an appeal
Ten bricks and a mil
Free all the guys, middle fingers to jail
Man, I do this shit for real
Only like the work tan, I don't like it pale

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Swear I love my plug, He just like kin
He front me 5 bricks and I buy about 10
Trap life or no life, Man, this shit serious
Run off with them bricks you might not see your fucking kids
Savage life bitch, That's how a nigga live
Drilled my last plug cause he ain't keep it real
Fredo, Fredo, Fredo, My name ring bells
Run up on a opp and give his ass these shells
Man, You niggas lame as hell
Keep 100 shots so I don't run out of shells
Man, I do this shit for real
Free all them guys that's facing all them years

[Hook]
