[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
In the kitchen with the work, got residue on my Margiellas
Ran up a check, I got these lame niggas jealous
Two AK's, ran like ain't no felon
Pull up on a nigga block and give his ass these weapons
I will whack a nigga that's close to you just to send a message
Pussy niggas too soft, I guess I'm too aggresive
So much money comin' in, shit I ain't even stressin'
Put that bag on your head just to show your gang a lesson
I sent a box and the bitch landed
In the field like I'm playin' Madden
Shit's gone when a nigga get it
Tryna find a plug that can be my ticket
I'm the plug, just being 'pecific
Ray Charles can see me winning
All this work, this shit terrific
I hit the streets, I'm 2Pac in it

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed

[Verse 2: Cory Lingo]
Out of zone flight and I just landed
Run off with your shit, reprimanded
Overlooked, I don't understand it
Ask your ho 'bout me, don't recommend it
Ask your ho 'bout me, her name Sandy
I break her off like a piece of candy
I pass that ho just like playin' Madden
Good in your hood, yeah I'm nice and dandy
Left-handed, left-handed
I throw that stack with my left-handed
How you the man, you gettin' man-handled
We in the streets, boy you pan handling
We ain't into beef, I'd rather get me a check
Watch my flex, talkin' 'bout (woo)
I got next, talkin' 'bout (Lingo)
Dirty as a bitch
I cut the price at the cell store
Watchin' my back at the mailbox
I was duckin' 'til the shells stopped
You from the hood, you get shellshocked
Ten toes in my Timberlands
Run up the racks, yeah like Wimbledon
Nigga bitin' like an M&M
Nigga the same like synonym

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed
I hit the streets and they so demanding
I get the work and it just landed
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
I trap out houses that's so abandoned
Smokin' dope with my right hand
So I'm whippin' dope like I'm left handed
Whippin' dope like I'm left handed
