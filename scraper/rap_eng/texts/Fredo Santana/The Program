[Intro]
P-PLUGS!
Corey Lingo what's up man

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know the program
Fredo don't answer to no man
Pull up with choppers in both hands
Super strapped up in them black vans
Trap niggas wearing Margielas
I don't do no damn black vans
Where I'm from is like Pakistan
Where I'm from is like Iran

[Verse 1]
OG, yeah I changed my life
Had to switch up from selling white (I had to)
Move this shit like it's in the way
I get them packs and I make a play (I do)
I get their cash and I fade away
These niggas ain't real, they super fake
I want a meal and I just ate, I want a meal and I just ate
I run the street, boy get up to date
My niggas be trapping from state to state
Pull up with the chopper and put it to your face
Money on deck if I catch a case
My niggas savage and we going ape
These niggas soft like a damn grape
Get the fuck away from these space
These niggas broke and I can't relate

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know the program
Fredo don't answer to no man
Pull up with choppers in both hands
Super strapped up in them black vans
Trap niggas wearing Margielas
I don't do no damn black vans
Where I'm from is like Pakistan
Where I'm from is like Iran
Y'all niggas know the program
Fredo don't answer to no man
Pull up with choppers in both hands
Super strapped up in them black vans
Trap niggas wearing Margielas
I don't do no damn black vans
Where I'm from is like Pakistan
Where I'm from is like Iran

[Verse 2: Gino Marley]
Young black nigga in a red coupe
And my [?] got no roof
Put the cash in the box, I don't damn shoot
And I'm sticking to the money, I'm the damn glue
And my trap cool so we wear no shoes
And my trap jump up with no rules
Trap filled up like high school
And my world moving [?]
And I pour lean and I pop fools
And I got [?] popped too
And that bitch made runs through the whole crew
And my crew only move for the damn loot
My bih running up a duffle
Running through the green no huddle
Bulldog on me, no muzzle
Got a bulldog on me, no tustle
And I'm still in the hood eating ruffles
Still living good with the cluckers
Still blend in good with the hustlers
Fiends from '06 still have my numbers
And I'm still in the hood eating ruffles
Still living good with the cluckers
Still blend in good with the hustlers
Fiends from '06 still have my numbers
