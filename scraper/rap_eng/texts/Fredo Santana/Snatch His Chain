[Intro: Fredo Santana & Chief Keef]
Yeah nigga, yeah, yeah (squad)
Squad shit baby you know how we rockin' main, from the streets baby, gang shit baby (Sosa baby, Fredo baby, Gino)

[Chorus: Fredo Santana & Gino Marley]
Every time I step outside I got some new money
See a lame, snatch his chain, I bet he won't do nothing
Been with the shit since a jit, ain't gotta prove nothing
Be with real shooters, I swear we'll shoot something
And every time you see Lil Marley just know l got some blue hundreds
Shooter got a jeweler, my lil nigga wanna spit somethin'
Old hoes stuck in new ways see this new money
Old hoes stuck in new ways see these blue hundreds

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana & Gino Marley]
Feeling like an actor 'cause my life is a movie
But no I'm not acting, 'cause I keep MAC's and Uzi's
Designer what I wear, I mix that Raf with that Tsubi
These niggas wanna hate but I tell these niggas shoot me
A veteran in the field, I promise I am not a rookie
On the west coast smokin' the best dope, got me feeling like Tookie
And if I'm feeling sad I just fuck up on a groupie
Most savage in the game, I swear they scared to book me
And if I had a problem 'fore I get it, shooters took it
And if I serve you out in public please tell me who looking
Probably take a trip to Cali just to smoke the cookie
Bitch you lookin' at a coach, I been ballin' since a rookie
And if a nigga rob you for my pack, bitch show me who took it
You don't want the pistol in your show then why you book me?
And I never took nothing from a nigga who wasn't looking so
You ain't gotta go and tell the nigga that I took it

[Chorus: Fredo Santana & Gino Marley]
Every time I step outside I got some new money
See a lame, snatch his chain, I bet he won't do nothing
Been with the shit since a jit, ain't gotta prove nothing
Be with real shooters, I swear we'll shoot something
And every time you see Lil Marley just know l got some blue hundreds
Shooter got a jeweler, my lil nigga wanna spit somethin'
Old hoes stuck in new ways see this new money
Old hoes stuck in new ways see these blue hundreds

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
In a new Maybach, in the front with a two two
Three motherfucker no, this is not a deuce deuce
Gang with me, riding past all the goose goose
I'll make it rain on you before I salute you
Smokin' hella fuckin' O's, and I got the racks too
And I got my shooter with me posted like a statue
Don't even fuckin' sneeze, he won't hesitate to blast you
All this pissy jewelry on me, point me to the restroom
My lil niggas hot sauce
Hit you with the four five, don't care if you're five four
You better be in by the streetlights
I'm aiming for the richest 'cause I know what the streets like

[Chorus: Fredo Santana & Gino Marley]
Every time I step outside I got some new money
See a lame, snatch his chain, I bet he won't do nothing
Been with the shit since a jit, ain't gotta prove nothing
Be with real shooters, I swear we'll shoot something
And every time you see  Lil Marley just know l got some blue hundreds
Shooter got a jeweler, my lil nigga wanna spit somethin'
Old hoes stuck in new ways see this new money
Old hoes stuck in new ways see these blue hundreds
