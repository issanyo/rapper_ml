[Intro]
Fredo Kruger!

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug

I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug

[Verse 1]
Trapper of the year, bitch I can't stop trappin'
Weed so stanky, you can smell it through the pack
Put it in the pot, then I bag it in the plastic
Crack doing numbers clucka say I got magic,
But if you run up on me then, it's gonna be a tragic
Them bullets get to flyin', couple bodies and a casket
A fiend for that money, I swear I'm an addict
Wherever it's at, when I see it, I just grab it
The 30 that I'm packin', rob me, it ain't happen
Now you on the news for this .40 that I'm blastin'
My plug, he be taxin', but I'mma set him up
Have my killas in his house, whoever they see, they wettin' up

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug

I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug

[Verse]
My trap don't slow up, supplyin' 'til they stop us,
Hop out, nigga, we ain't servin', unless your car parked
Bitches see me starstruck, niggas wanna play tough
Actin' like they want war, this 'K will tear your face off
Last week robbed the kush man, this week rob the dope man
Heard you holdin' work man, get your ass poked, fam.
Thinkin Its A Joke Fam, Then I Kick Yo Door In
Everybody on the ground - Ballout bring them ropes in!
Kush smoke, kush smoke - all I do is kush smoke!
Disrespect my set, then you fuck around and get smoked!
Gamble with your wife, ask my shooters what they in for
Fed ass niggas - snitching, giving info!

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug

I'm 'bout to rob my plug, take his ass down
For a couple bricks, then feed it to my town
I'm 'bout to rob my plug, I'm 'bout to rob my plug
