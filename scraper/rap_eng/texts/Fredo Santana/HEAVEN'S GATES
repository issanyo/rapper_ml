[VERSE 1: FREDO SANTANA]
I BEEN BARRED OUT
XANNED OUT FOR 3 DAYS
SMOKE THE KUSH
SIPPIN LEAN, CANT SEE STRAIGHT
GOIN TO SLEEP EARLY MORNINGS
CAN'T SLEEP LATE
SO MUCH DRUGS ON MY MIND
CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT
FUCK THE POLICE
THEY TRYNA PULL ME OVER
CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME'WAS SOBER
ME AND DURK STILL DOIN' HITS IN THE ROVER
LAST WEEK, TRIED TO PINPOINT ME OUT FOR MURDER

[PREHOOK: ASH RISER]
TOOK SOME TIME TO FIND MYSELF
I LOST SOME IN THE BOXING MATCH
TOOK THE DIVE, I TOOK THE BREAD
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO HAVE ME BACK
I'M SPACED OUT SMOKING BACKWOODS TILL MY LUNGS COLLAPSE,
MEDICATED GENERATION
DAMN RIGHT, YOU CAN CALL IT THAT

[HOOK: ASH]
WHEN I MEET MY MAKER,
I JUST PRAY HE LETS ME IN
CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW THAT I'VE DONE SOME SHIT
I'M JUST PRAYIN' THAT HE LETS ME IN
HEAVEN'S GATES

WHEN I MEET MY MAKER,
I JUST PRAY HE LETS ME IN.
CAUSE WE BOTH KNOW THAT I'VE DONE SOME SHIT
PRAYIN GOD THAT HE WILL LET ME IN
HEAVEN'S GATES


[VERSE 2: ASH]
WALK ON STAGE
DRESSED UP LIKE A CLOWN
GESTURE TO THE QUEEN WITH FACIAL GESTURES THAT HE'S DOWN
BULLET TO THE HEAD
BODY ON THE GROUND
MOTIONLESS LIKE KENNEDY
THE NATION ROARS ALOUD
WAY TOO SLOW
FOR COKE HEAD BROS
GIRLS POUNDING ALCOHOL
WITH POWDER IN THEIR NOSE
I'M A DY-ING BREED
MY LUNGS THEY BLEED
WHAT THE FUCK YOU MEAN MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES?

[HOOK x2]
