[Hook]
I’m going wherever this cup’s gonna take me
I hope it’s some place good where the weather is amazing
I’m going wherever this plane’s gonna fly me
I don't care where I'm going, just as long as I'm gone, with some tree, window seat do you know what I'm sayin

[Verse 1 – Fredo Santana]
I’m going so far away, where nobody can see me
I been going so hard, I need to take it easy
Xanax after Xanax, I think I need some more lean
While the bitch tryna have sex, but I already fell asleep
All these drugs, all these girls, all these guns up in this bitch
I feel like the man up in this bitch
Any nigga disrespecting, he be laying in this bitch
Got a couple killers get to spraying in this bitch
All this fame bringing fake friends
All I see is enemies
Think I’m falling off the edge
Wishing someone’d catch me
I’m going to Texas, to find lean
I’m going so far away
Where no one can find me

[Hook]
I’m going wherever this cup’s gonna take me
I hope it’s some place good where the weather is amazing
I’m going wherever this plane’s gonna fly me
I don't care where I'm going, just as long as I'm gone, with some tree, window seat do you know what I'm sayin

[Verse 2 – Ben West]
Ay, I don’t know what I’m saying
Balmain, yeah you know what I’m paying, yeah you know what I’m paying
Ay, you should see the crib that I stay in
You should see the bed that I lay in, the bed that I lay in
Balling I didn’t know I was playing, balling I didn’t know I was playing
Let alone I was scoring, said I pull up at 11
Fuck it’s like four in the morning
Pour a four of the [?]
You know what I’m saying cause you acting bitter
Every time you talking shit your nose is getting bigger
When I hopped off of my plane I felt like Lynyrd Skynyrd
When I hopped off of my plane I felt like Lynyrd Skynyrd
I’m sipping H-Town like I’m James Harden
If you see me in New York I’m headed to the Garden
Martinis with the olives, you’re at Olive Garden
I don’t ever use a key when my car started
Fredo got a burner and I got a poker
I mixed something up with something, I hate being sober
I ain’t never looking back, I got acne on my back
All black from the strap do you know what I’m saying
