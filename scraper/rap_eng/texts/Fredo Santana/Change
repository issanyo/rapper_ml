[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Money change niggas, but I change money
Try to rob me, then you know some shots comin
Gbe, glory boyz, we can't go for nothing
40 in my pocket, bake yo ass like a oven
Whole team real niggas, we don't feel niggas
I ain't gotta shoot you I'll send my lil niggas
Sneak dissin and hatin on my downfall
I'm in the trap, movin bags the size of baseballs
Cash out, jewish lawyer, now the case closed
Niggas haters, when I pull up see they face froze
I be counting hunneds talking real pesos
Give you a halo, your bitch want Fredo

[Verse 3: Gino Marley]
Too many faces on me, I could hardly count 'em
All this money, all this cash, counting smoking sour
All these shots up in this choppa cause a bullet shower
All this money that I'm throwing, that's a money shower
Connect call, I'm done less than an hour
Money, respect and all that come with the power
Gino Marley I don't play, I sleep next to a llama
I can't change, get changed if you become a problem
All we know is grind come from the bottom
If we ain't got it pull the caper, just to solve the problem
All we know is grind come from the bottom
If we ain't got it pull the caper, just to change the problem

Steady counting franklins, the bitches know my name
Bought all control and got a lot of robin jeans
Don't mix me with the rappin, boy I clap heat
Half these niggas fake cause they ain't in the streets
Signing checks, bitch I'm ballin need no receipts
Lot of foreign thots, ridin' around in foreign drops
Foreign thots who given top, for the opps I got 100 shots
Dope smokin thats 365, bitch chasin me I know why
