[Intro]
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Work coming in and you know I put my tax on it

[Hook]
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Work coming in and you know I put my tax on it

[Verse 1]
I remember when I ain't had nothing
Now a nigga pull up stunting
Money fall out all hundreds
Make yo bitch wanna suck something
Ain't no money like trap money
Trap house jumping why you think these racks on me?
Remember being broke bitches used to act funny
Now im seeing them hoes when i got these racks on me

[Hook]
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Work coming in and you know I put my tax on it
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Ain't no money like trap money
Work coming in and you know I put my tax on it
