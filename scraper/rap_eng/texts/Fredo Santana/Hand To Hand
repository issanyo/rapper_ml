Yo what's up, where that money at? That real money though

[Hook]
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
Everyday I'm bussin' juggs
Just to get that fuckin' bands
My nickname should be rubberband
'Cause all I do is get them bands
Your boyfriend a fucking fan
Get shot for shorting me grams

[Verse 1]
Watches got Lil' Meechie diamonds on it
'Cause all it do is dance
Po-Police pull over
Imma run, I can't go to jail
I can look you in your eyes and tell that you frail
I can look you in your eyes and tell you probably talk to twelve

[Pre-Hook]
Run up a sack, get it right lil' nigga
I got big guns, I don't fight lil' nigga
Fuck a meet and greet, you can meet my pistol
Got a AR in the cut, and it solve my issue
Bit-Bitch I'm Super Savage ain't gotta call no nigga"
When I think it's beef I just call my pistol
Ridin' shotgun with this 'K on my lap
I be in the trap, don't give a fuck about rap
Run up a sack, get it right lil' nigga
I got big guns, I don't fight lil' nigga
Fuck a meet and greet, you can meet my pistol
Got a AR in the cut, and it solve my issue

[Hook]
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
Everyday I'm bussin' juggs
Just to get that fuckin' bands
My nickname should be rubberband
Coz all I do is get them bands
Your boyfriend a fucking fan
Get shot for shorting me grams
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
Never needed a helping hand
I'll remember doing hand to hand
