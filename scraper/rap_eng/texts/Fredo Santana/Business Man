[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I'm a business man so all my business straight
Gotta stop trapping, need to switch lanes
Or I'ma end up on a fuckin' bigger case
Feds on my trail, you know I switch plates
I ain't just in Chiraq, I had to switch states
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I'm a business man so all my business straight

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
If a nigga play with me, then it's DOA
I got real shooters, shoot you in the face
Want a whole thing, I whip it in your face
And when I meet my plug a pistol on my waist
Couple shots gettin' fired if you in my way
Shots get to beatin' like some 808s
I got niggas catchin' bodies every day
A nigga can die from what he gotta say
Should've kept his mouth closed anyway
Them fuckin' choppers come out any day
Kill a nigga on his fuckin' birthday
Then turn it to his motherfuckin' worst day
I'm a savage so you know Chiraq be my birthplace
Kidnap a nigga, find out where that work stay
I sip red but I love how that purp taste

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I'm a business man so all my business straight
Gotta stop trapping, need to switch lanes
Or I'ma end up on a fuckin' bigger case
Feds on my trail, you know I switch plates
I ain't just in Chiraq, I had to switch states
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I'm a business man so all my business straight

[Verse 2: Lil Duke]
We smoke out the pound, we don't smoke eighths
Its like every day we on the jet in different states
I don't want no ramen noodles, all I want is steak
If a pussy try me he gonna die today
Young nigga get it, you know how we play
Three bitches with me, they callin' me bae
Pullin' out, bustin' it right on they face
Then pull up my pants, get the fuck 'bout my day
Free my lil homie, just caught him a case
Pull up and hop out and let that bitch spray
Run and get hit in the back with a K
Dick in her mouth, give a fuck what she say
Knock a nigga off and lay low
If his ass sweet I'ma hit him with K-roll
YSL Glo Gang, and bitch I'm with Fredo
Aim at his head and now you got a halo
Run through the dogs, run through the dogs
Get you knocked off and I just make a call
Jumped off the porch and I went straight to ballin'
Lot of these niggas be faking and 'flauging
I'm in LA like a Dodger
Took off on the plug, the nigga still calling
Balling like I hit the lotto
Went to the dealership, copped me an auto
Fire your ass up and hide out in Chicago
Feds they runnin' through the hood in a Tahoe
They gon' dig me like a pothole
I put a suit and a tie on

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
I'm a business man so all my business straight
Gotta stop trapping, need to switch lanes
Or I'ma end up on a fuckin' bigger case
Feds on my trail, you know I switch plates
I ain't just in Chiraq, I had to switch states
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I sell whole pounds, I don't sell eighths
I'm a business man so all my business straight
