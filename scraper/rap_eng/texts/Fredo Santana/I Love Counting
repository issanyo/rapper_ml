I love counting, I love counting
I love counting, I love counting

[Verse 1 : Gino Marley]
24 hours I do graveyard shit
All my niggas aim at money & we never miss
Early morning cooked the dope up on my Fredo shit
Outta town another name on my Diego shit
I buy a car I load the trunk on some impatient shit
And I smoke a lot of dope on some Jamaican shit
And when I count the money stay up out my fucking business
And bitch we Savage Squad fuck what making you think we friendly

[Hook : Gino Marley]
Ever since I could remember I just love counting
I can't trust you round my money, need no help to count it
I grew up around some trappers, got some money counter
Ever since I could remember I just love counting
I love counting, I love counting
Ever since I could remember I just love counting
I love counting, I love counting
And I can't trust you 'round my money, need no help to count it

[Verse 2 : Fredo Santana]
Savage Squad then my niggas & none of us friendly
In the trap with 10 guns & none of 'em empty
Bad bitches at my shows they show me their titties
In my pocket none but money, them 100s & 50s
In the trap my favorite spot, you know it's the kitchen
Bagging work in the pot, I'm whipping & mixing
Big bundles no shorts, I'm serving them pigeons
Im stretching them chickens, I'm flipping them biscuits
Everyday at the money I'm chasing them benjis
The way I check a bitch I'm Don Juan with the pimping
Funny ass niggas actors just like Eddie Griffin
Funny ass niggas actors just like Eddie Griffin

[Hook : Gino Marley]

[Verse 3 : Gino Marley]
I love counting, I love counting
All this money in this room, need no help to count it
Get my white off top like top of a mountain
If a nigga try to rob the showers'll drown him
I'm paper chasing eatin my stomach still growlin
Ever since I was little got money & count it
And nowadays I trap so I'm counting them 1000s
Put the plastic 'round the packs & then ship to them houses
Late nights in the trap me & Fredo just counting
And we all about the money just counting them 1000s
Late nights in the trap me & Fredo just counting
And we all about the money just counting & counting

[Hook : Gino Marley]
