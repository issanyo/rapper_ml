[Intro: Wrekonize]
She said some crazy shit and I was like, you're a freak
Ha, freak, you heard me? You're a freak!

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
And I truly wanna come and see what make you tick
Thick hips and a pierced lip, let me dip quick
Shit, get this dick I'm gonna give
My mind, that's one hell of a grip
For a woman looking semi-innocent
You been waiting for the minute you could live
And get me all up in your liver and your ribs
This is not for the women talking bout a little romance
I mean the women not afraid to get both hands
Close and, down on a grown man
She got toys and the wax
All down to her back and her outfit - latex
But it's feeling quite dangerous
This ain't never really felt like safe sex
But we do it anyway, with a bit of Henny
Get a medic ready for the blade, you're an outcast
I'm Vinny on the case
Would never diss on a Marisa Tomei
Get down, like I know you wanna wrassle
I'm livin' out my life never bashful
Give it to me with the lace and the tassles
And let 'em hate, tight lippin' assholes
Give me a safe word, it's picnic
Tie you up and give me the jailbird, my hitlist
Needs you to get this, sick shit
Right up from the gutter bring another for the L-word
Take a breath, and I'm gonna accept
Your best bet is to blow my mind
Could put your back out, but I'm sick of that route
I'mma have you tryin' to get up with a broken spine

[Hook: Wrekonize]
And everywhere that we go
You're never fittin' in with all the regular folks
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You got your bad habits, but I ain't mad at it
Some people don't feel right being that average
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You're a freak

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hella pale like Twilight, had to get her up
Into my room and give her my bite
When the sky's bright, she never deny pipe
But we get really horny lovin' and fly by night
She so like a freakshow, other people
Speak no, peace show full of ego
She so, like a d-bro, with her V though
That'll have a nigga weak in the P, bro
Everywhere we go people spot us
They yelling (You're a freak)
But I love it, she's beautiful
Rough and rugged, you're a keep
And when I put it up inside of her
She say to me (You're a freak)
Cause when I'm bangin' it sideways
I'll be in it balls deep
If you want this thing and
You ain't trippin' that, you bloody (You're a freak)
If you like to put yourself
Where she be muddy, you're a creep
If you want me to stick it between your boobies
When you're lickin' it (You're a freak)
If you want me to be normal
Stiff and formal, then you're a geek
Invite them all, and I pipe with all, of my might
I'mma be a fright to y'all, cause I bite the broads
And I knife them all in my sight
Never be ordinary, stick the more the merry
Go that far, we stay cray
Everyone look at you stupid
When you're an F-R-E-A-K

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rittz]
Fuck, fuck, fuck yeah she is
She brought her heart in her head she gives
She like a dick sucka, yes but a specialist
She deepthroatin' dick and act like it was effortless
You come around and the fuckin' is a definite
She like “Hehe! Everybody say I’m freaky!“
She let me run a train on her, give her DP
I made it rain on her had her drinkin' peepee
Suckin' on my pinky, and I just hit her with the shocker
Two in the pink one in the stink
Now I gotcha, turn the girl out when I hit it
‘Cause she said I get her off more
She ain’t into soft-core
Fuck around the car port
On the backyard floor
Shit to giggles was nothing let me
See how freaky that you are
Pour the liquor on her titty
Lick it off, smoke a cigarette
I bet she gon’ be ready for an encore
Type of freak I applaude for
Even worst when I'm on the pill I
Gave the bitch a dirty sanchez
She jerk my damn dick
Had her face looking' like a bukkake film
And I don’t care if there’s hair
Or the twat is trim
Meatcurtains are my dinner roll
I'ma hit a ho
Hook on my fishing pole
She got me swimming in the pussy
Like I’m under the olympic gold
I was a freak when I was six years old
My first grade teacher had a nice set of freckled tits
I couldn’t wait for the day I was old enough
To bust a nut, givin' girls pearl necklaces
And you a sexy bitch, an exhibitionist
So when I hit it, I'ma break a bitch in half
Face fine as hell, pussy tight as fuck
But she'd still rather take it in the ass
She a motherfuckin' freak
