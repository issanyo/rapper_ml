Black Walt told me if you wanna bonafide banger
You gotta start with a hard ass kick and snare
Add some dope ass music around and a hard MC and you got it

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Every night, it seem like we celebrating birthdays (Hoooooo!)
'Cause rappin on planet Earth pays
Smelling like vers√®, or is it Versace?
You got me sloppy from popping this oxys and shots of sake, copy?
All you ladies in here, I am sharing wood
I just, wanna lay between ya and ram square into it
'Cause, when it come to women, your man Aaron's good
I done been inside-a more woman than Planned Parenthood
I got more bottles, than newborn babies, for your boring ladies
I want you drink up till you horn crazy and rape me
'Till I'm lazy and achey, wanna get shady and tape me?
Okay baby lets say we tape me inflating your trachia
Im just partying I ain't letting the tool spit
I ain't tryna have you haters layin below the pulpit
40 acres and mule sit, in my garage with a cool kit
Eat, drink and be merry man and miss me with all that bullshit
Ain't no telling how drunk and high you'll get

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music

[Verse 2: Big Ben]
And they like, and they like, yup do that thing you do (I am)
What you mean? baby girl I need some liquor too
Ay, she need a picture too, Big Ben she want a picture too
Im F-L-Y, so why not? We can flick a few (Fuck yea)
Knock the lenses out my frames and start the ruckus (Yes)
So when I scream through the scene you know you niggas finna crush it
Max out on swagga, not your ordinary rapper
But I do my thing extra, like no ordinary madness (Got ya)
Keep that smooth movement so proper
They keep choosin' on ya dude 'cause I be's all about my dollas
On the baddest bitch swaggin through, its not a big deal
Shit I receive more tongue then a double stacked thizz pill
It's real, what you say you lose the crew and 'scape with me
No need to slow it down you let them other suckas pace the speed, dig it? (Yep)
Fuck it, I'mma party like a trap star
And probably get my ass thrown out for going that hard
Ay, Ay, ay, ay

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music

[Verse 3: Shadow]
Yo, your flow missed me, buy vodka, get pissy
Roll with Tech N9ne, bear arms and get grizzly
Everready, a Killer, that flow's Anghellic
Storytelling and battle-rapping, who can't sell it?
Should I speed it up? Nah, I'ma keep it strange
My inner voices told my outer voice to be deranged
The devil on my shoulder got a devil on his back
Who told him every time I see Biancas give her ass a smack
I need a bunk rock, fresh pair of sucker duckers
It's a party, I'm bullshittin' with muh'fuckas
Shadow fly, look at bitches with a crooked eye
Battle me? I think your favorite rapper'd rather die
Who you know can spit a flow this clean?
My notebooks to tenth grade, I got so many sixteens
Please, I got a lot of hard tones
That'll fuck up your view of The View like Star Jones
Y'all clones, my style is the original
Half you wack rappers just epitomize pitiful
But me? spittin' classic is a ritual
I stopped liking rap when the lying got habitual
I'm sick of you, the streets turned me to a sentinel
I'm so not Common, but I still see the bitch in you
(So guess what) Shit, can't nobody out-rhyme me
So Tech, call Trav right now and tell him sign me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music
(Hey hey)
We party and bullshit
Booze it with floosies (Hey hey)
And that's how we dos it
Not the Biancas we choosing
Everybody lose it, listenin' to our music

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, Throw your cups in the air if you're drunk like me
Yeah, Tech N9ne, Big Ben, Shadow, X-rated vodka and Sprite, boy
