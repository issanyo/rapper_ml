[Hook: Stige]
Ice cold, dark as a winter day
My shadow got up and ran away
I feel so out of place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Nothing louder than silence
Alone with your thoughts, prone to the violence
Count your blessings man, offer your tidings
Before it’s all over and you meet your requirements
Peace, god, what’s the science?
Why we walkin’ through these toxic environments?
Is it the money or the quest for the finest?
And why buy one if no man is an island?
Push hard enough, we all start wyling
All start fighting and all start shining
Who you calling when your fingers start dialing?
And if they pick up who you hope had good timing?
Everybody good, everybody grinding
Or are we just rats on a wheel exercising?
Is it authentic well then let me see that lining
I’ll keep to myself ‘til we all stop hiding

[Hook: Stige]
Ice cold, dark as a winter day
My shadow got up and ran away
I feel so out of place
I’m just in a quiet place

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Summon a shaman, this level of livid is uncommon
For the body I’m in, me and goodness are not bonding
Feel like bombing on you pawns and straight conmen
Fake ones on Aaron D Yates mom ‘nem
You ain’t got the answers, I was rocking in pampers
Man your cancer leaves a damper
Nothing but a slander rambler, damn the scams of gamblers
Prehistoric plans, you can’t hand us
Look at the time ticking
I’m on a divine designed mission
‘Cause the rhymes sick and we in a position to climb quick
And I think you ain’t really feeling me, killing me
They don’t see the real in T. N9ne and his shine ability
No longer I keep this in a quiet place
If you thinkin’ Tech N9ne and Krizz is an acquired taste
Then you probably won’t keep on making your desired rate
Make the weak rehired skates
So we keep the going up and can finally give the sky a taste

[Hook: Stige]
Ice cold, dark as a winter day
My shadow got up and ran away
I feel so out of place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place
I’m just in a quiet place

[Outro: Stige]
Ice cold, dark as a winter day
My shadow got up and ran away
I feel so out of place
I’m just in a quiet place
