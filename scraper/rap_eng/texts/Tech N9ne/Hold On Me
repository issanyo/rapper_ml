[Hook: Kate Rose]
Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much
I can't handle life without it, it's become my crutch
I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
All my life whenever I got into a relationship
Couldn't take the nagging of women never be taking tips
When they said I needed just one of them in my stable
But never would I listen I wasn't able they say to me
I know you got other chicks, and I'm sick of this shit
You think I'm asleep when you go sneak away for a bit
I hear you talking to her why do you treat me like this
Why do you make it so hard to admit
Player would never show his hand
I become something they can't stand
In the long run they on one, our song's done
Get they bags and they bounce
And they say I'm sick and need a little counseling
You are the king, but don't know how to treat a queen
I hear the words you speak about her when you dream
Thought that we were a team, how could you let her intervene
Guess you got me
Really got some feelings for this one you can't stop me

Gimme some of that good stuff I need so much

I don't need anything else
I'm just gonna use it for myself
Been craving it tonight so it's good I've got plans
Soon I'll be flying, oh so high

[Bridge: Kate Rose]
Cause it will have its hold on me
Her blood is coursing through my veins
I need to hold on tight just let it take the reigns

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Don't get in the game
If there's a feeling you can't hang
Women tell me that I should be loyal to one dame
It's a shame, they say I'm a playa and I never change
I remain, how we start out the same
And I can never get with it, you can give it to whomever wanna get it
Now that I'm seeing vivid you come at me I'mma pivot and
Get up out of your room, treat me like a buffoon
I can see you love her to the moon
I cannot lie I'm hella busted, they say I can't be trusted
I ain't got time to love shit but this does it
Loving her even when out in public goes with me wherever I tug it
I'm really done with you yes I had a lot of fun with you
But your many will soon be none with you
So what you gonna do?
It's only one and without it I might lose it
I cannot keep a woman cause time with my music
