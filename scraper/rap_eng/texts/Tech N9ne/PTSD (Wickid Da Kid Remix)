[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
My hurt, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A verticle leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And they have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Wickid Da Kid ]
I think my brain's mocking me
Questioning my confidence
Laughing at my train of thought and drowning out my common sense
Actin irresponsibly I mash it into smithereens
Then it starts to rain again them black thoughts caving in
Bout to take the game back inside of my brain again
Strap it up and tape it in
Make you bitches embrace the wind
Hail on ya chest just to see what type of shape you in
Call that shit the press instead of cameras its hollow tips
The right to assemble more like the right to dismember
I write to dismember these niggas watch em fold and quiver. Can't imagine leaving though
Beware of my dismissal cause I'm already breaking the  backs of tracks the moment I disassemble
Forget ya symbolism you not iconic this "E" and ring on my desktop is more of a mogul than you
Never in your mirror I stay beyond your Views its Da Kid and S.I.N don't you get the two confused
