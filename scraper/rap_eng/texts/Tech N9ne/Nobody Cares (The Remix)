[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
They said I really don't rhyme anymore
And dreaded the moment the N9na find any dough
Climb in the hoes, he never will shine when he flow
What are you listening to? The music I'm giving to you
Is killing the muthafuckas you kick it and jigglin' to
Some of you get it, but a lot of you never let it
'Cause you know when it get up into your woman, I'ma wet it
I'ma wake up, everybody break up the haters
We do it for real and never do fakers, amaze us
Tecca N9na spending cake up in Vegas
Got the mule and 40 acres decades ago
Nigga, I'm a vet, made to grow
Look at it when we city to city, Tech pays the dough
Watching my lyrical bullet lay ya low
Next way to go and she with it so let's lay the flow
These bustas be so funny, they all shakin' when I rip
But in my face, they be so chummy, nigga, y'all, fakin' when I flip
When they know that my flow is money, y'all is bogus so go get from me
Man, I'm over this, how they grungy when they all take it in the hip?
War, I declare, 'til Donny air
And I want ¡MAYDAY!, Kaliko, Stevie Stone, Ubi and Godi there
I'm gonna push this hip-hop music to the fullest 'til I'll be mayor
They don't give a fuck if I swear, this the God damn remix to "Nobody Cares"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko, (Crystal Watson) & (Tech N9ne)]
Everything in my head, all these words that I said
(Nobody cares) Nobody cares
(And nobody gives a damn what I say, who I am)
(Nobody cares) Nobody cares
These bright lights show my life (nobody cares)
(No one, no one, no one, no one cares, nobody, nobody)

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Stare in the face of the careless pair
This facts, ain't nobody gotta say no more
I been breaking my back while you been crazy relaxed
A workaholic with a bit of crooked halo-lo
Paint so pro that I can't go prone
You better get a step and let the maintenance know
That I kick in doors and get to stickin' whores
All 'cause I'm loving every minute that I grace this show
Game beater, came sweeter
Every word they said to me is "damn", diva
Vein heater, flame speaker
¡MAYDAY! mace, they spray liters
Wavin' all out 'cause I'm tearing the crowd
They know I came to drop 'em down a whole lot of stairs
Rockin' so rare, I'm a topper, don't stare
'Cause ya know we said before that nobody cares

[Verse 3: Godemis]
Catch this bullet, who's the receiver?
I never learn how to follow a leader
In need of a medical reticle bleeder
You don't give a flying fuck, well, me neither
Maybe I'm overthinking it, look at the way I'm linkin' it
With words, I'm a seamstress
Got plenty of fuel, I pity the fool
And tell 'em ridicule is the burden of genius
And I mean this, like I seen this
Coming but it don't mean shit to y'all
And my pedal's to the metal and whenever they ready
They said it, I'm coming to get it 'til I hit the wall
Stealing all, of the cake, trip
Placement of tables turn a bit, so who the fuck's turn is it?
Couldn't give two shits, see, I'm not concerned with it, my

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Is it that my shit's too catchy?
Is it that these hits come naturally?
Is it that we the chosen ones
And y'all never get picked so you act like a bitch?
Tell me why 'cause you're making me feel bad
Can we all get along? Don't be mad
Carry on, fuck it, bring the feedback
I feel so at home where the odds'll be stacked
Crash course into music business
Better trust yo' muthafuckin' instincts
'Cause these suits are scared of what's different
Until it's banging on top of hit lists
And that's why the industry's fiction
And Strange Music's here to reign, bitches
We killed the whole opposition
All 'cause our fans are fuckin' hellicious

[Verse 5: Ubiquitous]
Sometimes, if you say the word, the word falls
On deaf ears or peers and they half-forget it
It feels like nobody'll care until you stare
Back apathetic, and that's pathetic
Matter fact, it's not in my rap genetics
Whatever the fuck you was after, get it
The law of magnetic attraction'll come and cause
Reaction, dog, you only have to let it, ah
Act upon my instinct when I set the bar
Let the cards fall where they may play
52, now pick it up, I, make the mess
Maybe yes, that's where they stay
No, fear to show, I'm clear to go
Anybody else who ever been here should know
That a voice with a passion and purpose
Is far from a theory, yo, but y'all don't hear me though, uh

[Hook]

[Bridge: Stevie Stone] (x2)
Eeeee! Hit 'em with the muthafuckin' rhythm
When they come with the N9ne, I'ma get 'em
Kaliko, ¡MAYDAY! Ces Cru, Strangeland
We mix all wit' 'em like

[Verse 6: Stevie Stone]
Muthafucka, in the meanwhile, hear the remix
We bound, what I mean now? Rush time!
Stage killer fuckin' with a main nigga
But the other Strange nigga, Brotha Lynch, gon' cut 'em up!
Come in a noose, ya (cover contusions), vertical movement
(The kid is a problem, better yet, he a nuisance)
All on my dick, nigga!

[Verse 7: Krizz Kaliko]
I'll get off my own dick, nigga, if you get off it
I'm sick, nigga, puke it off, and in my lane, refuse to walk it
Independent nigga who's the boss refuse to loss
And, if ya get offended, bust a move's an option
On the low (low), too many people is peepin'
We frequently eat up a piece of fajita, think he equal to me
I let him know (know) that he could be in the seat
And takin' off his feet about it and I'ma tweet about it
Reppin', me and the Tech, nigga, we effin'
When we done, they wish we never left it
And I'm guessin' you never had to pull out your weapon
I'm the next best, give 'em a lesson (okay)
The way we eat a nigga's lunch, Psilocybin combusts
Man, fuck it
