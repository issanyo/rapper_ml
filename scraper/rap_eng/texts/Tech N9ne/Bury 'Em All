[Intro: Tech N9ne]
You mother fuckers want to set me up and kill me

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You know what I mean
These motherfuckers seem to be all about dreams
Having my cake and eating it
People see weak in this, greet the beast sink your teeth in this
Even family hand me calamity
Cannot be sitting with insanity trying to damage me
Even niggas who work with me
Having fantasies of erasing their men in me
Look you blood suckin', mud fuckin', punks, chumps
Gay faggots, maggots trying to get paid
Really better slipped away to 30
Hearing your call, bloody murdering y'all
Scurry and focus conserving the brawl
Whoop bitch ass niggas and I pass we bury 'em all

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Cause some people look up inside of my head
You'll see why I keep a gun on the side of the bed
They watching out for the Watson house
Because I'm paranoid that every noise is means for me to kill
Grab my mm. steel
I'm a walking zombie obviously
Feel like I'm going insane, losing more than a little bit
Of my life I'm thinking about killing it
Or reverse the gun and curse the one whose purpose is to hurt us
Now that you got the nerve he's buried you both in the first place

[Hook]
Stay awake, cause if you want to still (survive)
The way for you to stay (alive)
Is keep far away from me
(Stay away from me, please nobody pray from me)
Cause I can surely take you can't hide from me
All of them I will bury, bury them all

[Verse 3: Monoxide]
It's a shame to be hated on so angrily
And all these people who came to see the demise of me
And the disguise we in analysing me to the sight of me
When I live in society, with all these people we call friends
And when the hook-up's gone it all ends
So we sit there alone and pretend
Hoping no one will notice when you leave us like a latest trend
Cause that's just how you bitches tend
And you wonder why I stay awake
With a back full of knives
And a mind so Twiztid I can hear them say

[Verse 4: Madrox]
That's why we're center of the mix, center of attention
So many levels of my mind's dimension
Inquisitive minds always asking questions
Shoot 'em all down that will loose attention
Dark, sarcastic, quit pretending
Tell it in their vibe when we try to be-friend them
See it in their eyes with the money we spending
Cover your legs because you know we can attend in avenging
Yes its self-oppression, too damn dumb can't learn a lesson
Heart still broke no sign of affection
Heavily medicated I forgot to mention
Dark black work that's my affection
Double headed axe that's my protection
Sling to the blood bring resurrection
Believe and expect in the unexpected

[Hook]

[Verse 5: 1 Ton]
It’s a catastrophe, stop harassing me, asking me
(Too many goddamn questions)
I’m at capacity and not a blasphemy baffling
(So I gotta count my blessings)
One: Never do what they do
Two: Only you can be you
Three: And everyone want to keep scoring me (whores)
And not too many people want to go hardcore
Some get lifted, watching the Pistons
And now he's spitting wicked shit like it was Twiztid
Freaks don't get it want to get it
Got to let their lip go and run off with it
I'm hitting the wall
Got to stand up when it's scary to fall
Got to man up when your making the call
And be tough when your walking the hall
Twiztid, Potluck and I bury them all

[Verse 6: UnderRated]
My whole life I was struggling to be free
And now it's hard to believe that it's me
When I'm flipping the rhythm and taking over the mic
I'm like a thief in the night with the venomous bite
Getting better and better with every rhyme that I write
Because it's been a long time let me shed some light
Up in the moon with the candle light
I was flipping every word like Vannah White
Don't judge me dude you don't know me man
You don't know my crew or who the fuck I am
Step back with your redneck views
We ain't giving a fuck we do what we choose
Oh I'm rude? Oh my bad, sorry and shit I gotta take a stand
This ain't making a damn we need the man with a plan
Not another mother fucker want to face this man
Listen, damn understand just cause you're rich
Doesn't mean you the man
They ain't getting no better, look around its all bad
The American dream make the Confederate flag
Little kids getting lost, brainwashed so sad
Even the head of the class crash go bad
Sex and the drugs on the streets that we ran
Mama never told me it would be like that

[Hook x2]
