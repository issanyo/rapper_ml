Fuck you niggers

Killer

[Tech N9ne]
I don't even know why I came here in the first place
'Cause I've never understood why a person would even need a psychiatrist
I mean obviously Travis thought I needed this so it's whatever, ya know?

[Dr. Frazier]
Do you believe in hypnosis, Mr. Yates?

[Tech N9ne]
Hell no!

[Dr. Frazier]
Hahahahaha
Okay, Mr. Yates
Lay back and relax

[Tech N9ne]
Okay..

[Dr. Frazier]
Let your eyes follow the pendulum
The pendulum, Mr. Yates, not my breasts

[Tech N9ne]
Oh, sorry 'n shit! eheh

[Dr. Frazier]
Listen to the sound of my voice
Can you still hear me, Mr. Yates?

[Tech N9ne]
Yes

[Dr. Frazier]
I want inside your thoughts
Tell me exactly what's on your mind

[Tech N9ne]
Just listen to me a second
'Cause it's all about you baby
Girl, I promise I'll never hurt you again
'Cause this is my last album
And I just want to be with you girl
And I'll never call you out of your name again
And I want you 'cause I love you...
Bullshit! I'm just playing y'all, come on!
