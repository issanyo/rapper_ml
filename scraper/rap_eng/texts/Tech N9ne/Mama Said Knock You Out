[Ivan Moody]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a mon-SOON
Listen to the bass go BOOM
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, we're towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop these lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you betta move
Don't ever compare
Us to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying our price

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out [HUUUH!!!]
Mama said knock you out [HUUUH!!!]

[Tech N9ne]
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the ra-di- [OHHHH!!!!]
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Past your soul!

[Hook]

[Moody] Breakdown!

MAMA SAID KNOCK YOU OUT!
