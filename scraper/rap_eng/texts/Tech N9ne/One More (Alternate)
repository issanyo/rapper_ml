[Verse 1: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more night
Give me one more time
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
Give me one more song
Give me one more note
Give me all your music cause it's all I really know

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more night
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
Give me one more night
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for

[Verse 2: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more story
Give me one more fan
One more person who knows who I am
One more moment in the sun
Give me just one number one
Cause I'm giving all my time to you
I need you, I need you, I need you

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more night
I need you, I need you, I need you
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
Give me one more night
I need you
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
Give me one more night

[Bridge: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more, give me one more night
Give me one more, give me one more night
Give me one more, give me one more night
Give me one more night

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I've been on stage since I was in fourth grade
Then I spit it til I was on a source page
And all the people really got us more pay
And I'm thankful
You repped Strange so
All hail to Mackenzie
The gift she giving, like Santa Clause, fell through the chiminey
The music, touring, and all sales grew the frenzy
Envious suckas, when y'all yell you offend me
One more
Night to rip it up and all the people they done for
Cause when I'm on the mic I become war
Living my life up in the lights
Ever since I was a little when using my inner might
I didn't just happen to rap
In fact it's my passion to rap
When I get to mashing your clap
And it's fact, in exact, when you got Tech and Mack on the track

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Give me one more night
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
Give me one more night
I need you, I need you, I need you
Give me one more stage to play on, people to sing for
I need you
Give me one more night
