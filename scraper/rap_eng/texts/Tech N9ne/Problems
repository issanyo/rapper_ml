[Verse 1: Twista]
When I'm on the track you will see accuracy
Actually I know that you will see I come like I got the fully
Automatic for disintegration of the problematic and negativity of whoever caused the static
Pick up a rose and sniff a scent if you think it's magnificent
Stop the stressin' or just catch a blessin' if it's sin
If it's bills or if it's rent
Some of us worry some of us don't that's why everybody so different
The only answer to you problems, solve 'em
Stallin' is the only thing that can stop the ballin'
Though world is full of hatred, face it
Get out the matrix and let's get back to the basics
Instead of being individual let's practice a ritual of bein' indivisible when it's critical
So every time that some drama hit yo doorstep
Gotta try to keep your composure and don't let

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm a problem because I'm different
And people don't get it when I be the clown
Knockin' suckas down when I be kickin' my music
Tech is dangerous if you think you can hang with us
Sick in your brain a bit when I mangle it
Know that I'mma break and abuse it
Have you prayin' to God 'cause what I'm spraying is odd
And I'm slaying this broad, Tech Nina's laying his ride
I'm insatiable when it comes to be making this gouda
I'm a sniper, killa, murderer, look out I'm a shoota
A dilemma we taking out you beginners
Coming to my psycho cinema, it's a must that I crush them
If you accustomed to lovey dovey movies
Then you unlucky because they call me Tecca Nina: the snuff film
Throwing the fist up 'cause all of my grips up
People was hating but now they zipping their lips up
Never debated, you imitated get ripped up
Stuck off in Necropolis 'cause Tecca Nina and Twista's a

[Verse 3: Twista]
My alien complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
But when it come to dealin' with pain and problems and relationships I ain't gonna lie I ain't the bomb yet
What do we need? What's the resolution?
Is it restitution or just retribution? Let's just start a revolution
But wait, I'm hesitant because in fact
How can I fight to be equal if the president is black and umm...
A Chi Town resident at that
Hope we focus on us instead of wars in Iraq
The future is bright or will it be weary
Do I need to pay attention to conspiracy theories?
Is the government systematically destroyin' the population for the progress of one dominant nation?
Smile, even if the landlord callin'
Dodge 'em, but that the least of your problems

[Outro]
Try not to get worried
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you
Don't you know
