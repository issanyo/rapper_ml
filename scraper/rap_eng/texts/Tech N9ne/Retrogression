[Intro: Tech N9ne]
What is this in the distance?
My drug begging for commitment
Man I'm gonna do what they say
Release and just retrogress with Â¡Mayday!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm thinking of retrogression, about going back to my best friend
On a X Binge, but the uncut, Molly, will you kill me is the question
I miss sessions with about two chicks on deck
In my bed undressing now we meshing pressing
Sex and sweating left an empress of heaven
I used to boost her with Adderall, my teeth would chatter all gnaw
It really don't matter y'all, I'm cool
Like the cigarettes, I was a bigger threat to the clitoris
Successful sexually bit her neck get her wet
Just how hight can a nigga get
Blasted acid, F-asterisks-C-K, coulda' he say
He may crash it fit to replay D-Day ashes
I take masses so I could stay plastered
That great plastic I ate like bait in Lake Placid

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Molly I miss you, if I was to kiss you
Will you take this sick fool to gold days
I know you can lift moods when I'm having issues
I wish I could split smooth to the old days

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
If you feel like their plan don't fit us all
Then you will find my land don't give us law
If you feel like not taking that bigger fall!
Then with all respect if we retrogressed
Then they'll rid us all!

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Okay so lets go, retro-gression I'm guessing that Wrek knows
These memories all in my flesh though, strange love, he's in a depeche mode!
Some of the greatest sex woes that ex-ho
And if I was bringing a Vicks tips to her lips
It was for something that she'd never let go
I drink shots with her laughed and smoke Newports
The time we spent was too short, my mind is heading due north
My body's on its true course, this woman has got my youth sore
And tooth raw, all of the lights are leading me through a new door
Can't we just go back? Can't we just reunite?
I need a throwback to seeing you in flight
You had that down south body with a hint of death
Picked you up and held you down, sound until I went to rest
But who needs rest, when the world is gone
Everything is burning so I'mma just alert the globe and hurt you slow
You're known for fast love and vertigo, so I'll just
Pick you up and get a little intimate in a minute
A cue for the return of a virgin soul

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bernz]
I tuned 'em out, I-I tuned 'em out
Too busy turning on it dropping out
Behind my, my mama's house, producing clouds
Never understood my need to get numb
Meanwhile I'm bleeding out my eyes
Heaving out my lungs, trying to avoid the sun
Curious at a young age for a taste, watching them numb they faced
Till Caroline found someone for us to bring out on dates
I call it youthful curiosity, jumped the edge every saturday
Strobe lights and low lifes the city at night was calling me
I turned 'em out, I-I-I turned 'em out
Had 'em both kissing on my lips
Then smoked the spliff to boost the trip
Lift off, I'm gone, phone call my bro, let him know that I'm lost
And I got sand in my shoes from twilight beach - Menage a Trois
Heavily sedated I, grew up with jaded eyes
See she's been friends of mine since '99
But now we don't see eye to eye
Can't retrogress, unless life gets too heavy for my chest
Then I be tuning out and caning dropping out before they win
