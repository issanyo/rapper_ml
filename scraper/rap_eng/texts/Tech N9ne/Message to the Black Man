[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This song is very close and dear to my heart, man
To be able to say something like this
It takes a hella motherfucker to say it
This song is dedicated to all my people
Its called Message To The Black Man
Check it out

[Chorus]
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

[Verse 1]
It started on the slave ships (slave ships)
And field niggas would eventually take the day shift
With house niggas inside loyalty may shift
And it did divide us now we still need a race lift
Fuck a face lift
I ain't changing my identity
For energy from any that's obscenity
Now in 2007 we sick and ain't no remedy
Jealousy envy and murder it's like you ain't no kin to me
Guess we ain't nigga we go hard in the paint nigga
Still when you see me out you ain't the one who faint nigga
It's them other fans from them other lands
They listen to me more then my sister and brother man
I could see if I was a wack motherfucker
Bitchin' about the way that my people act motherfucker
But I do spit my people don't be so fuckin' reclusive
Get off of your lazy ass like you know something about music

[Chorus]
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

[Verse 2]
You cry about the way I paint my face
It ain't y'all taste, little homie let my state my case
I'm not a devil or damn jester rumors can fester
Never uplift a demon with the image of my ancestors
African, act like you see me when you be traffickin'
Laughter when you frown up at me your hatred is bafflin'
You watch American Idol my people my paint is tribal it
Symbolizes not evil but the will still in survival
You niggas be so tough the moment we roll up
Your upper lip rolled up you hatin' it so what
Everyone knows us my city is sold up
My shows crush but y'all don't show up
They say it's more than money bitches whores
It's funny this here's war my people at his door
And I'm knocking, meanwhile we rocking
Globally and it's sad man
Light black attendance got my people lookin' real bad man

[Chorus]
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

[Verse 3]
I wouldn't be bitchin' if I didn't want you around me
The way you write me up as a demon astounds me
Brotha Lynch, 40 Water, Federation, DMX
Busta Rhymes, Quincy, and X-Clan found me
Brother J homie he with me til this day homie
Who you know that's blacker then that?
With a staff and a Lac
My people lovin' that trash and they rap
I'm immaculate maybe they grab it if I was blastin' a mack
Attackin' my people cause I'm black and I'm lethal
With this rap I don't trap, but I'm crack
Why you do be so close-minded when I'm rhymin'
Wishin' you can find it
Everybody but you motherfuckers get behind it
And I'm doper then a ki nigga
Message to wee niggas
Rocking sold out shows is where I'm gonna be nigga
And that's all I sell out, something you should see nigga
Betcha would come and see it if I told you it was free nigga

[Chorus]
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you at my shows
We've been all over the globe
Ya we makin' the dough
But y'all ain't spinnin' it
My people you 'posed to be
My people ain't ya
But my people ain't something that I see
Cause ain't enough of you up on my records
And peepin' my shows
Y'all don't no that I'm about to become boss and take control

[Outro]
Act like you know I’m your very own, motherfuckers
Hardcore shit, stop buying all that bootleg bullshit, too
Support your motherfuckin' artist
And Big Scoob said, when he finds out who’s fuckin'
Bootleggin' the Summer Edition, Rogue Dog shit
He's at that motherfucking ass
And I’m right behind his motherfucking ass, you dig me?
Tech N9ne, nigga!
