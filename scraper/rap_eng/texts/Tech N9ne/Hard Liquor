[Hook]
(Hard liquor)
Me and my people be so drunk we don't drive
We take the trolley cause of (Hard liquor)
We started Waldo to Westport and pee
In every martini corner at the last call
And we all yellin' (Is there any more?)
When it ain't we go home for (Hard liquor)
(Make sure that it's mixed) Yeah
(And twist it with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, get drunk, on ice, get drunk, on ice, get drunk
Motherfucker, get drunk, yeah)

[Verse]
Aye, aye, they sayin' that I got high blood sugar
So I can't drink like I wanna drink, drink like I wanna know
I ain't playin' really cause I love liquor
So if I big drink am I gonna drink, jinxed, I don't wanna go
So I go hard as hell on one night, fun sight
If I'm drunk enough to start a bum fight
Done right, Henny, Jack and Gin, 151 Rum slight, none light
Novocain I know to blame a gun snipe on drunk life
Don't let the bar hit ya where the Lord split ya
Hit your ass, get your cash then they all richer
In the draw, pitcher, I'm a large sipper
When you wait, better hope I ain't in the car with you

[Hook]

[Verse Repeat]

[Outro]
Hard liquor, I need some more, hard liquor
All the alcoholics in this
Is there any more
We even go to WalMart for (Hard liquor)
Make sure that it's mixed
And twist it with a little bit of lemon juice
On ice, get drunk, on ice, get drunk, on ice, get drunk
Hard liquor, hard liquor
Is there any more?
Hard liquor
Make sure that it's mixed
And twist it with a little bit of lemon juice on ice, on ice, on ice, yeahhh
