[Verse 1]
I be so humble, my regular state
All loving, it's never no hate, a whole 'nother level of Yates
How there isn't when the brain of a rebel create
A fellow with a peddle to break, I'm settled, but this devil is awake
When it's applied, somethin' from deep inside
No longer sneaks and hides, it awakens the beast and pries
Through ligaments, bone and through eyes
No remnants known as true shyness
Rippin' and thrown in to die, given it moments to rise
Then a metamorphosis happens like a lit torch when it's rappin'
Hyped and it's warped and it's fashions
To bring forth war and it's passion
Laughin' wickedly, baby, what's happenin'
We’re smashin' ass, yes, that humble guy’s a has-been
And no they can't, come make me stay saint
When I get that on I black out, it feels like I may faint
Then I feel invincible, never come to kid or play prank
I say what the fuck I want and do what I want to do behind my

[Hook]
(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint) I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint) I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my

[Verse 2]
Brian Dennis painted my face back in the day
Like '94, look now, ain't it my taste
I know a lot of motherfuckers think he tainted my faith
But I keep that cross on me I pray and it just ain't at my grace
But I ain't perfect, give me paint and the mic and I'mma merc it
Kent Clark's within me, when I'm up he has no purpose
Tecca Nina the king that will bring the circus to the surface
Shaken the planet earth is a curse if you never heard this
Technicians started me juggalos they spotted me
Allotted me their land to expand this cultural odyssey
I'm their wicked prodigy, being strange is the policy
Anybody talking ill of my family can swallow me
Scenario, the more paint the marry-o a burial for Kent
He's square his ho keep him very low
My appearance to weak motherfuckers is scary tho
They can't even think of touching what I put through the stereo

[Speech]
Here's my analysis:
Since the beginning I have been saying that I'm a angel
But since I accepted the ways of the world;
Money, women, I became a worldly angel
But my mother always wanted me to do it for Christ
So I think the angel inside of me is ashamed
So in order to bring you all this rawness I have learned from earth
I hide behind my

(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint) I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my
(Face Paint) I can be who I want to be
And I know it's still me, but I'm totally free with my
(Face Paint) I put it on for you to see
What is hiding deep inside behind my

[Intro (Backwards)]
Think again, think again, nigga
Huh, the angels been long gone
You full blooded animal (Ha-ha-ha)
That's what's inside of you
You just don't want to admit it
But you know you've become... totally Animal
And the Face Paint brings it forth ha-ha-ha
