[Intro 1: Tech N9ne]
This is the trip! The best part I, really, really like!
Yeah, I'm proud to be a part of this number!
Used to be good, now I'm going bad..
Yo.. Like this!

[Intro 2: Tech N9ne]
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
Everything was 'posed to be all Jesus
But it seems like everything is all Satan
But it seems like everything is all Satan

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
In the new millennium you can't play with nobody's mind, man
Deliberately messing up a good thing or holding up a grind and
You already knowing life's a big fight against time, man
Crime minds really shine, who's dying is the kind man
When some of us, find that life ain't beautiful, we switch to pharmaceuticals
Your nine to five ain't suitable, for the cuticles
I'm going bad, currently I keep ending up with even less than I had
Record company is dealing me something sad
How do you expect a man to sit and wait with three kids
For you to figure out what Tech S-I-N-G-L-E is?
Going bad, I feel like I just might act a fool when I see 'em
Got a nigga, feeling petty looking forward to per diem
I got some issues, most of these record execs are soft as tissues
Defecate on they self when they here some "I'm gon' get yous"
Understand this; when a Rogue sat, you trying to hold back his dough sack
And try to bozack and he go cock the 4-4 back, you chose that
So cut these ties and I'll rise, let's compromise
Or else I'll hop a plane with my guys
QDIII said, "It ain't all good, when you sign with a record label
Who ain't had a hot soundtrack ever since Boyz N Da Hood"

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
I'm going
Bad
No luck, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
So rough I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
No church, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

[Hook: Charmelle]
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

[Interlude: LeCoya LeJuene]
No one wants to see an angel in this world in these days
To them I am the epitome of evil
A found soul looking to save the lost
To them I am death and of not wanting an evil man

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
For living expenses they gave me like thirty-five G's
Picture me in a hospital shot up with thirty IV's
That's what I really needed when I found out this drama trauma
Instead of moving I should've kept all that and continued to stay with my girl's momma
Gutter living got me tripping I'm smoking bud daily
Gutter living got me tripping, I'm going blood crazy
Gutter living got me tripping, I'm struggling like a bad actor
Gutter living got me sounding like The Madd Rapper
The bad influence, the bad apple, the bad seed (That's me, yes)
The bad people, the bad karma, the bad breed
Mushroom tripping, brain's a mushroom cloud
Finding groupies tugging on my zipper while I'm hanging on to my vows
Demons surround me in triple stage darkness and taunt me
They know I'm the good guy going bad so they want me
All my family remembers way back in the day I was good but they doubt now
Disperse, I'm going bad, feel me out now

[Hook: Charmelle]
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

[Interlude: LeCoya LeJuene]
To say going bad to most ha
Never been good just getting worst
Thoughts to destroy and to tear things apart
Thoughts to praise, adore and to love
The trick is what voice is telling you what

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Mind state of a pirate, I'm irate
Used to be cool 'til some straight fool lit the pilot
Will I be that mid-town bound in the middle of a riot
Or at a warehouse shipping platinum, and I'm shaking hands with Violet
No love for the bane, false foes in the game
The Qwest wreck was a shame, twas a journey full of pain
But Tech N9ne will remain hella brave and untame so make way
For the reign I'm bringing Highland and Wayne
No thanks to Qwest they on the receiving end of the gun
I cursed you, for every time I climb you're getting fired one by one
But taking Juan with me 'cause he knows the true meaning of a modern day hippie
Who creates jewels off mushrooms and bombs sticky
Hog Stylin', Mid West Side and Newday and King Tech and Sway
These are the people keeping me alive to this day (Much love)
QD said "You can't make rell with a label
Who let Tipper Gore talk shit and made 'em take Ice T's cop killer off the shelves"

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
I'm going
Bad
No luck, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
So rough I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
No church, I'm going
Bad, bad, bad
Disperse I'm going
Bad
Feel me out now

[Hook: Charmelle]
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever
This life I live ain't extra
No angels to stand next to
To live a life that's better
I'll sacrifice whatever

[Outro: LeCoya LeJuene]
Right now I can't distinguish which voice I'm listening to
Am I evil? Or just another lost soul going bad?
Or just been bad and getting worst?
