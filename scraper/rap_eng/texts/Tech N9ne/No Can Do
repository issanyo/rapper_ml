Welcome to everready
Welcome to everready
Welcome to everready

[Tech N9ne]
The Religion!
First thing I wanna say is (what!)
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
It's the one with a name of a gun
Look at me mamma what I become is a monsta
Gangsta, fast But I want to
Thank ya for the last thirty-three
'Cause everybody's heard of me
And if they say that I'm fakin' mama it's perjury
'Cause your son comes with thunder now
That's why they wonder why we headline when I'm underground
In this mainstream game, my gang brings pain to cowards
Said I'm done, Kali give me the power
Come on wit' it (ah!)
You industry punks, I hope you fakes die
'Cause most of these rappers have a queer eye for the straight guy
Was that shit loud enough to hear?
Loud enough to echo through the city and bust your ears
Patrick Grant tried to sue us for a whole lot of bucks this year
Sell crazy somewhere else trick (we're all stocked up here)
Hey! I think I wanna say it again, y'all
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us
Can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Yo! Big Krizz Kaliko
Tell 'em, y'all can't fuck wit' us
Y'all can't fuck wit' us

[Verse 2: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Fuck niggas that got it in for me
Pretend the crowd's still got its energy, loud!
Rulers finna be crowned
Through foolin' around with ya's
Two hands and both thumbs down bitches
From biancas and biatrices, the theatrics is miraculous
You don't want to go on after us (no!)
This is a snippet of ridiculous, can't-get-with-us flows
Actually a little bit of babblin' liftin' your soul up
And we all grown up
And when we blown up
Don't get to frontin'
I'll give you country boys nothin'
You can cut us to thirty we stay on for an hour
'Cause them heads bobbin' in the crowd's ours (ABSOLUTE POWER!)
Main thing's taking over this mainstream
The game seems like they been waiting for a new A-Team
Ask Busta Rhymes, he said that nobody had the gift like him and Spliff
But me and Tech N9ne who y'all ain't fucking with

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us
Can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us

[Bridge 2: Tech N9ne]
This beat make me wanna say hallelujah (HAHAHA)
Yo, but instead I'm gonna say (what!?)
Y'all can't fuck with us
Y'all can't fuck with us

[Verse 3: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Okay this the benediction (now we got y'all listenin'!)
Whoa, just a fraction of friction from an act you was missin'
If you would actually listen you'd see whose ass you'd be kissin' (MUAH)
You're dealin' with one hell of a relic, ya see
I'm angelic but devils bring out the devil in me
I might pull it, the bullets'll be several, you'll see
A goody-goody get hoody, lesson from messin' with me

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
This is my testament Tecca Nina's been pressed against walls
Simply the best to get next to this so I represent all
Grab your breasts to this, have mo' sex to this, pop your crystal
Cock ya legs a bit, rock ya bed to this, drop the big drawls
'Tis to men to never wanna take a stand to
You chumps in trouble? We 'bout to bubble like shampoo
You might try but you can't do what Aaron and Sam do
You tryin' to ban who?
No can do!

[Tech N9ne]
It's a celebration bitches, yo
Y'all can't fuck with us

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us
Noo! No! No can do
Y'all can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us
Can't fuck wit' us, can't fuck wit' us

[Tech N9ne]
It's not that y'all wack that got it so bad
It's that y'all pissed 'cause we got it so good
Welcome to Tech world
