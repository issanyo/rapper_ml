[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Moral is shorter
My heart and my brain and spirit's out of order
And now the lord of phallus have thou recorder
Fallen angel warrior at the bottom drained to boiler
All remains a horror destroyer
In the middle of Sodom and Gomorrah!
Punk shit, all around, everybody been calling clown
The crawling town, get wicked
Rip this sickness is falling down
Over this basic gay shit, erase it, face it
Wake this hatred and make this place get APESHIT!
No kinda way you stopping this
Flow gonna make apocalypse
Power's stop lots of mocking shit
Lot of us often is blocking this
Optimist, positive, hope for the
Future's loss of awesomeness
I can get boss and a lot of us will
Rot and pop like hot sausages
I am not the light, I'm the opposite
Through narcissistic awfulness
I'm keeping Tech off of this rocker
Black heart and darker
Peep it, this is the thesis wrote in feces
I'm as beast as broken leashes
Little secret - I am the Seepage

[Hook: Tonesha Sanders]
Heartless darkness, I feel it seeping out of me
Watch this raw shit seeping out the anatomy
Heartless darkness, I feel it seeping out of me
It's gotten me nauseous, the seepage deep inside of me
Touch it (Touch it) feel it (Feel it)
Love it (Love it) seepage (Seepage)
(2X)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Do you believe in KOD? Yes, when you see them nod
He's in season, the reason Light is leaving, he's even odd
All 6's And 7's, mauled bitches and reverends
Frauds quick get the steppin' When the hog pit it is in heaven
Dog shit if he's the messenger
When he take a threat then bless a wet nigga
Instead of getting a stretch and put death on a replica
That is the weakest piece of release
But the seepage has no discretion for
Check in bro with a plethora is to lesson ya
Big Yates, he's stuck in the sick state
Some speaking that his fate's to be wack when he gets cake
Well, he gets cake and the critics they spit hate
But the sinister shit shakes, so long to the Mixed Plate
I just ate, pretty punane and mustard
Psychos in lust are skeeting seepage, these nuts charred
What I got to say to the people who pick at and gut stars
Thinking I'mma lose the ability to bust hard, you fucktards!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The KOD's a hothead
The shocks and the socks red
And the darkness is not dead
Regalide up like mop-heads
Chop heads off suckers like my name was Ahmed
Alahu Akbar rugged Aaron Dantez Yates
Oh muhfuckas I'm coming out of his nose
I'm running out of his toes
His throat and clouded his soul
Peep his crowd as it grows
No matter what route is chose
He's climbing right out his globe
Don't doubt it how loud it blows!
