[Intro]
Gimme some guitar, K.Lloyd!
Yeah, I like that, keep going mayne
Rock and roll, baby!
Yo, we gon' get real drunk to this one
So, if you wanna get knocked over
Get the hell out the mosh pit, baby
Cause we 'bout to go, okay

[Verse 1]
I like big booty bitches, rappin' and Lynyrd Skynyrd
Cases of beer cold as a Kansas City winter
Drink to get drunk then find a chick and put dick off in her
Then make her take me shopping for kicks at Harold Pener
My family gave me rock, my family gave me rap
The streets gave me guap, the streets gave me straps
Black bitches fuck me, white bitches love me
Trust me I do 'em both at the same time rough as rugby
Do 'em both to Bon Jovi and then to Public Enemy
Energy in me definitively I'm on Hennessey, then I'm on Jimmy B
I used to have red spikes at raves, and then
Turn around havin' blue and red fights with K's
Your parents got a cold shiver cause a pot of
Gold hit a father gorilla that's a dollar go getta
And he's an awesome flow spitter
Your daughter goes with a guy who loathes millers
Why?

[Hook]
Cause I'm a rock and roll nigga
They don't understand me, God naturally tanned me
You don't like it I can be a nigga
Rockin' 600 diamonds, black and white bitches cryin'
When they eyes hit this rock and roll nigga (Hell yeah!)
And I ain't changin', got my Slipknot bangin
And I swear to God I ain't never ever giving up
Fried chicken wings and Coors Light nigga what?

[Verse 2]
High school hung with a white bruja
Came home then I went straight to Jumu'ah
Then after that I put back on my red puma
Then bark at a chick the same height and color as Uma
And we get the lead out to Zeppelin we blow the bed out
Got a call from one of the homies in trouble so yo we sped out
Got to the hood and found a rivalry took his head out
We had to show them evil motherfuckers what that red 'bout
Until we find the killers you know we will search
For those who kill first we gon' let the steel squirt
And this mentality's valid because we real hurt
To ease the pain I listen to Geddy, Alex and Neil Peart
Growin' up it was a chore, cause I gravitated towards stuff the homies ignored
Like trippin' off Bad Brains when on my skateboard
Even more, I named my gangsta rap label after The Doors!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My momma made me, raised me, played me 80's made me crazy
My father played me crazy, made me aid me vaguely praised me
But I'm a real with a lot of will, remembered I would kill for a dollar bill
But that all changed with Strange man I gotta deal
Like every scholar in the game, got a lot of mill
Still a riot maker fuckin' bring the house down
Who that gang bangin' rocker with the loud sound
That's Tecca Nina with the shit that make them broads hound
Telekinesis with my speeches get them drawers down
And that goes for the grand dragon daughters too (Whoah)
And the Neo-Soul conscious chicks they wanna swallow who? (N9ne!)
The show gritter and yo little low wigger, better not be caught with no sitter

[Hook]
