[Intro]
Get the fuck outta here (N9na)
Get the fuck outta here (Popper)
Get the fuck outta here (Wall)
Get the fuck outta here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, I'm a spitter, you other cats beyond litter
That's prolly why you just penny pushin' and I'm bigger
So you hate on me 'cause you lack paper and I'm gritter
With two Biancas upon my arms like John Ritter
Oh my goodness is they talkin' shit again?
When I been playa on the day I became a U.S. citizen
Haters keep wi-di-shin' I'ma take a loss but I'm finishin'
Killer but scriller just like Percy Miller no limits then
I aim for digits, 100 percent of my people came to get it
He used to be bigger but then became a midget
Taken out of the game, livin' lame and livid
So we gotta hate on the next man, 'cause he don't got the money
We left 'em at the bottom and now he's the ex Tech fan
Get the fuck outta my face, I'm winnin' it's not a mistake
You gotta be hot at me sittin' watchin' me ex-pand
You take falls, I take her and take draws
They give you the wait stall, they give me the mate calls (Oh Baby!)
You ye tall, love is me but hates y'all
That's why I'ma take all, with Pops and the Great Wall nigga!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
If fraud is what you sellin' (Get the fuck outta here!)
When they lie you got to tell 'em (Get the fuck outta here!)
If you steppin' to me wrong (Get the fuck outta here!)
You ain't got to go home but get (The fuck outta here!)
Yeah

Tell 'em what to do (What?) Tell 'em what to do (What?)
Tell 'em what to do, get the fuck outta here
Tell 'em what to do (What?) Tell 'em what to do (What?)

(You ain't got to go home but get the fuck outta here)

[Verse 2: The Popper]
I stay in the zone like 28's in a baggie
A veteran stands here rookie niggas at ease (Yes sir!)
Grab these shove your middle fingers in the sky
Tell it like it is when I rap so y'all identify
Start from the ground formulate a enterprise
Get outta here before you get punished and penalized
I've been advised to stay in this lane homie
I swear when I rap I say it's not a thang phony
I'm icy, I'm shinin' though I ain't got a chain on me
Even when I'm inside of this booth I keep my thang on me
And when it rains on me I don't complain homie
Eliminate the prob so I don't have the strain on me
I talks a bunch of shit, the haters wan flamethrow me
Rappers ain't got the balls or the gall to place they aims on me
Get the fuck outta here tell 'em Wall told ya
Yo Popper done deal any one of your soft soldiers

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
If fraud is what you sellin' (Get the fuck outta here!)
When they lie you got to tell 'em (Get the fuck outta here!)

[Paul Wall]
Yea, Paul Wall, Tech N9ne, Popper, Swishahouse/TF

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
I do this for my partners standin' out there on the block
And I do this for them haters on the sideline that knock
Despite what they be sayin' I just can't seem to stop
Gettin' this guap I got a lot, partner I'm almost to the top
I gotta cop new watch or fresh grill and new clothes
I'm tryin' to come down candy low sideways on foes
I gotta get that bread it be money over these hoes
'Cause my fans be turnin' into foes and harsh words lead to blows
They mad at me 'cause I'm the shit while they just shit
And I get up off my ass and get it while they just sit
They upset 'cause I'm gettin' bread while they layin' in bed
Even though I started off at the bottom I'm hundred miles ahead
They steady be talkin' blind on me, tryin' to slander my name
'Cause I'm the man mayne, but they washed up down the drain
They hate me 'cause they ain't me but please make no mistake
They knock me but can't stop me 'cause I'm Paul Wall the Great baby
