[Hook] x2
When you see me in slow mo', once I turn my back
You wanna talk real tough, but you not built like that
So let's ride, ri-ri-ride, somebody's gonna die
So let's ride, ri-ri-ride, somebody's gonna die

[Tech N9ne]
You don't want to try me
Leavin niggas soggy
Heated repeated the Nina be hot as wasabi
Feelin the fury of Missouri sicker than Ozzy
Laughin at playa haters, gigglin like Fozzie
Wocka wocka wocka, the Nina poppin your chakra
Was bout to stop up and lock up the office I got the body
Out at Mecropolis fuckin offa this pop of this
Toss em off in a glomma shit cause murderin is a hobby
You be, actin like you bleedin the block
Preachin crack and rap, you needin to stop
We can whackin wax immediately flop
Bees attack the crap, indeed it be brought
The want the drama it can be they way
But they don't really wanna see the Ninay spray
Let em all bleed, it can be they day
Fuckin up with Tech N9ne and DJ Clay

[DJ Clay]
You don't even know me
Actin like we homies
Then when I turn my back's when you hold me
Pussy motha fuckas the ones we call phonies
Keep that talkin we leavin yo momma lonely
All black van creepin down your street slowly
Doors open up and we leave your home holey
If your not in then we know where your ho be
Barrel to her head while I'm makin her blow me
Listen
For all you fake, flakes givin real a bad name
You can save it, cause we can see through you
Like glasses what you was made of
I'm a let the oozles like I'm not aimin
Make you loose noodles and I ain't talkin ramen
Garentee you ain't leavin with what you came in
Me and Tech N9ne gonna pray for you amen
