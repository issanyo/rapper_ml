[Intro: Passionate MC]
Yeah
Ah
Passionate MC
Tech N9ne
Yo Token!
Assassins!

[Verse 1: Token]
Woah, woah, woah, all respect due, you not due much
You don't do much, you got much to do, I do too much
You got it backwards, I never take back words
Throw words back 'til my back hurt, backed up, when your back turned, I'ma be back
Lookin' for the chip on your shoulder, homie I'ma eat that
Lot of people talkin' about me, I don't keep track
Same people sending me their songs I don't keep track
Click - delete that!
My feedback was, "Quit", so I quit givin' feedback
Kickin' my feet back thinkin' I just need to relax
Shit, where the speed at?
Follow me everybody, murderin' everything
They callin' me teddy but the industry idiots in my pockets to get the money, now bitch repeat that
I'm a young kid, slash old man, slash 'oh man he go HAM', oh shit, no shit, cast that
Fall back on the beat, got a beat to break then bake the beat to recreate
Don't respect you if you demand a trampoline every time you take a leap of faith
I take risks, take this, take that, take fans, take shit from no man
No man's land where I send y'all then forget y'all, I'm against y'all
Then again dog, this Token and he a full clip
Can't take me, tame me or entertain me with that bullshit

[Interlude]
One, Two, One, Two, Three
Ay

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yates on a great song to lay shlong, on a beat a nigga way strong
Everybody tell me to pick up the pace Holmes
So I gotta rip it until all my taste gone
Spray zone, step into me get ya face blown
Stay home, N9na 'bout to race on a bass tone
That double a prone to lay clones up in the pital and they moan with a trach on
I'm the poppa, not the mama, dasvidaniya
When you come into my octagon, you lost mañana
And I'm 'bout to pop the llama, lotta commas, put a rock upon ya
Nobody want it with (K-O-D) and Token, he be on the (J-O-B)
He murderin' everybody but never the Illuminati
We makin' the wannabes (Say holy) (SHIT!)
N9na and Token be killin' 'em, all the fear that we instill in 'em
Make 'em shiver with the chill and them som' bitches
Thinkin' that Tech N9ne gonna mean that the gun glitches
Some crickets, what they hear in the place when I come wicked
I become vicious, Tecca N9na makin' dumb digits
And I run with it like when they hung niggas (Pyune)
I be the killa, the one you be feeling for real, I got the hot flows
Caught foes 'cause I got hoes, a lot though when I rock shows
Not no iller scrot bro if you crooked you smell like Sasso
Used to be Rock, lock load, me and Token paint it like Picasso
Motherfucka

[Verse 3: Passionate MC]
Yo, I'm putting the Darth in Anakin, ripping apart the planet with niggas alarmed and panicking
Thoughts are scrambling, more than the doctors handling all of your parts with bandages
And with all advantages I can show them through the devastation that
Their end’s awaiting like the head of Satan with a demonstration of its separation
Got the pencil breaking in the right hand, twist Necks like a mic stand
Nightmare! Rip flesh in the distance of a lightyear, yeah!
If you really want to talk about the buzz and the way that I had to bring it back quick
With a tactic that is steadily breaking the fabric of the universe suddenly at risk
'Cause I’ve mastered this, Passionate’s back in his actions of sacrilege
After subtracting these bitches way faster than an abacus
I’m blasting shit, the snub nose never tells lies
The .38 wrapped around my waist is not a belt size
Like pregnant birds in the sky, you’ll see the shells fly
Then I’ll kill myself just to make the devil in hell die
I tell time, and the clock is ticking on the opposition when I pop it in 'em
With an awkward rhythm, you can hear them hollering louder than opera women
I'm a beast!
