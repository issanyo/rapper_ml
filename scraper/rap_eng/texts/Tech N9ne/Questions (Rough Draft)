[Intro: Don Juan & Tech N9ne]
The name of this motherfucker is called "Questions (Rough Draft)" (Ha ha, tell 'em)
QD3 did the beat (All day, all night)
What's up to everybody out there in L.A
What's really goin on?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why so many questions?
What am I doing?
I talk to myself... when there's no-one to talk to

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I wanna ask me a question:
When am I gonna make it up out of a hellish and devilish way?
When are you gonna make a mill-ions worth of dividends?
When are you gonna make ends, generate bread?
Who in the hell left the gate open to you in the cell?
Is everybody on wavelength like us?
Why do I rip it in half? Do we kick ass with backwards
Attacks ish like hap ut eallavik?
Can you wait a minute? Can you slow it up a little bit N9na so I can get up in it?
But did you really wanna dabble in fanatical supernatural
Lyrically radical milli minutes, I'm about to begin it
Can I get some, can I spit some, which one?
When am I gonna get off this trip?
Can I take another peel, why do I feel
Like I'm a sick individual in the room, poppin' off at the lip?
Do you, feel me? Do you do voodoo really?
Did you get it? Did you want a real epidemic?
Will you let me run up in it?
What's the word; is it absurd? What is that ish you heard?
Was it real, is it real, was it really real?
Tech N9ne in it to win it besides QD third occurred
Who's the worst, who's rastafari?
You never livin', never sure it's Sela-ssie
The first brother on the planet Earth, who?
Do you wanna flow, what you wanna do?
How can I be in the zone like this, gone like this?
How can I break the obsession?
In the middle of it all, when I snap back, step back
And ask myself; what, why do you ask so many questions?

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Do you understand? What you gonna do when N9na hit you
With the critical homicidal lyrical killer flippin'
Leavin' you with boo-boo underpants?
How does it feel? Do you wanna come up and chill - with an assassin?
Can you feel it inside, what?
The feeling of a commotion of two titans clashing
Why me, who are you, what I am supposed to do - what a nigga here fo'?
Who do you fear mo'? Is it the N9ne, with a brand new joint?
Like to hear it, here go
What are you lookin' at, when am I gonna get a dose of Thorazine?
Can you give me a little something to ease the pain?
Ease the mayn, who's the mayn?
Tecca N9na with the Rogue Dogs and the Mid-west side crew's to blame
Can I get a little back with attack ish?
What do you accomplish, ever can't you diss, diss
Pitless bottom of a, in you toss thou nigga ass, Bade Mitch
Hater-playa percent hundred a is [?]
Down ever who off but aggin
Did you know Tech N9ne hot like a dragon
Did you feel it baby? Can you give me a double dose
Of whatever the feeling I'm gettin' is really pain
Kobain, for anybody want a piece of this, sickness
Is it a cinch to get with hot?
Who, when, where what why?
I'm at the pinnacle with a killer eye, do I wanna
Die no I just wanna dose of the most inner syringe
Up in my thigh, bonzai!!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Now do you know what the real is?
Does everybody think I'm twisted? Non-realistic
Or do you think that I'm gifted, I'ma live freer
Can you help me? Am I lookin' at you
Can I be peepin' you from afar, please, remain calm
Could you be the reason I'm a bomb
Straight out of Vietnam, ready to explode on Sa-tan?
Tell me what the problem is, I'm alright where the bottom is
Do you know what a empty column is?
Am I your worst nightmare? I feel sick right there
Should I blow it out, can I do without, do I need help?
Am I living within a pen of demons?
I'm stressing, can I get a blessing (from who?)
The one who cursed me with all these Questions

Some say I'm psychotic
But if I have to label it, it would be "confusion"
It's like I gotta write shit like this
To keep my head from exploding, y'knahmsayin'?
So many questions

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
Why?
Do I wanna stick 'em with another hit up out of abyss?
Why?
Am I the pinnacle when I rip it, I'm a killer menace
