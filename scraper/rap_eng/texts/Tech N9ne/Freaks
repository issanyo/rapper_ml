Now, freaky, freaky, freaky people
Freaky, freaky, freaky people
Freaky, freaky, freaky people
Freaky, freaky, freaky people

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Those freaks
Look at their hair
Look what they wear
Everyone stares
(Look at me!)
Look at those freaks
Look at their clothes
Everyone knows
It's all for show

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I never fit in with the in crowd
So me and myself became penpals, wow!
And when I got older I freaked out
The craziness started to leak out
Now, when I met this crazy dud-e
Told me eatin' MC's was his favourite foodie
Had me really wilding out and tryin' dyeing my hair
Yo, I'm already funny lookin', give them a reason to stare
But juggalos and juggalettes, again
We take a note for when ya let us in
And I’m supposed to take my med-ic-ine
Cause if I don’t, then I'mma check ya chin-lin
Somebody take the top of my thinker
I'm mergin' in your lane and I ain't usin' a blinker
Cause I get the people off of their seats
On they feet they geek to see freaks

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I don't, have
Nothin' in common with the rappers, past
Because I never went to gym right after class
I never liked sports
Or any sort of events on the court, I abort
Immediately
They label me conceded
Really I just needed to be
Free to be leaded my leader
Preceded to read it
Superceded to greet it my creet it
Beat it, defeat it
People heat it, they can eat it for me
I think different, I just have to do me
With the painted face
Go ahead and laugh but you'll see
Got the woman that you never get act so loosely
Round the Nina baby
Ready to sass seduce me
They don't really care I read up on Manson
Son of Sam, they answerin'
For a killer Kansion
Freaky dreams of tamprun, with a sexy van
But a booty like Allena Hansen, dancin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Now look at Tech N9ne with his painted up, painted up face
Blame it on him and it ain't a disgrace
Look at how they wear their hair spiked up
In a crowd mosh pits and they're way turned up
Their songs is all about drinkin' and sex
What d'you expect?
Do you even think about the effects
Of the kids that's lookin' up to ya
It's up to ya
We take our middle finger and we turn it up to ya
Cause we tattoo everything and pierce everything
We drink every day, and smoke evergreen
Generation X
We put the rap in the sub-urbs
Punk rock in the projects
The snake and the bat is back
And if ya hate, better wait
Better play the back
Cause they scream from the nosebleed seeds
On the feet they geek to see freaks

[Hook]

Now freaky people clap your hands like this
Freaky people clap your hands like that
Now everybody clap your hands like this
Everybody clap your hands for Big Krizz

[Hook]
