Around my way its so hood like the head of my chevy, I'm like yo
Don't get caught on the wrong one cause you layin' spaghetti, so keep it low
Get Kutt (x4)

Once I crack the seal up off this hen I'm goin' in the bin(?)

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]

Just like a fastball from my nigga Zack Greinke
My pants a lil' baggy and my breath kinda stanky
But my kicks on hit, my cups half filled
With my KC fitted to the right on tilt
So I'm lightin' up my black and mild wine
Would tip my rearview mirror if you was lookin' fine
I got this cup of henny but I need to make a tea
Now I'm headed up to tops bout to get the sprite and lime
Now I'm, driving like a bat up out of hell
Tryna be all I can be with a car just full of shells
I see my nigga Jeezy he off on twenty-sev
Holla at 'em bout the trees cause he keeps 'em Killa Kev
My day just startin' I ain't got no liquor left
Double back for another fifth of henny and some shells
Grape flavor homie I don't want 'em if they stale
Damn right whatchu thinkin' it ain't finna role itself, I'm tryna get kutt

[Hook]

Kutt is chillin, this whole willin, what more can I say I'm straight drillin'

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]

Now I'm cruising down prospect red and black v
Younger dogs from the hood wanna be just like me
Bandanna on the right and a pocket full of cheese
With a thumper on they hip under a fresh white t
Lookin' for a skeez one to bless my P
Comin' up on 59th is it sex I see? (hey honey!)
Feedin' in the middle of the street
Pullin' up as I get closer they already on my team
At first she didn't recognize the star without the braids
All up on me then she told me I look better with the fade
She bangin' but her friends might look better in the shade
Told her bop a ride with me and we can lose the motorcade
Headin' down back street she lookin' at me nasty
I'm lookin' at her body and she lookin' at the backseat
Ask me jumpin' all up in her like a papscream
I take it this is called gettin' kutt is what she asked me, yup

[Hook]

Went to the spot with major loot, chicken heads out there straight doin' the fool

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Pull up the clubs in got a line full of cuties
They let me in the door and now the haters lookin' stupid
Packed every weekend its the club for the freakin'
Had a shot and now I'm out cause its too hot for me be drinkin'
On my way around to westport karma lookin' fine
But I pass cause I see the same heffers every time
And if it ain't karma its america's pub (No more techno)
Gotta show the ghetto some love
Last stop I'mma make is on 86 the troops like a high school reunion if they ever faced to
And everybody here used to go to stain daws and we all know it was the most poppin' of em all
It wouldn't be right if we didn't have a fight
Six bitches by the bar and somebody pulled a knife
Moving too slow and the chick got struck
With a blade to the face shit is crazy somebody get kutt
