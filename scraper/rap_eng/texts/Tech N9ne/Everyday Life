[Verse 1: Short Nitty]

Everyday's a but one day
I rise over yesterday
Pray my stress away
In search of a better days
Nitty got hell to pay if rap doesn't sell
They say young black males today are only a cell decay
Never prevail they relayed into hell I say
Midwest me to my my mail each day
Nothing left to do at 26 I'm through
If common since ain't turning my petty dollars into mints
Its senseless too relentless to come out of this penniless
Life with out focus is meaningless
Everyday living is cool
But who knows if paying dues
Could turn straight fools into major made dudes
Hommies told me it was cold when I wrote it
So I quoted
Only get what's so sold to em
The rest is just told to em
Any day and everyday
Regardless of what my critics say
Papers to be made
Short Nitty's out on a chase
Erase thoughts of failure
I tell ya this Rottweiler
Is focused on any and every measure
Hustling day and night
Gambling life like dice
Turning my wrongs to rights
I'm Hyped
THIS IS MY EVERYDAY LIFE!!!


[Verse 2:Ahmad Bakarii]

This is my everyday life to see poverty and struggle
Live life incognito and be all about that hustle
Criminalistic wicked everyday
So it's pointless so I point this
Let em flank to that joint-less
Its just the everyday way of a young black male
Telling them tales coming to raise hell
With Nitty,Scoob my cartel that never fail
Fully regrouped be all about that mail
Then purchase me a coop strap
Rubber bands on my stacks
Can't relaxed pack them heaters
Chop them busters like a lumber jack
These murder facts come from real situations
God forgive us we just hogs forever on paper chasin
Lace my nikes stay posted cuz these niggas shisty
And you can hear that lama scream when I grip it tightly
Everyday, Everyday, the same shit Everyday
23rd day of May born Michael Anthony
They after me so I'm a bail to that capture me

[Hook]
Everyday Everyday Everyday Everyday
So much money to made these days
So many ways to get paid these days

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]

Its just my everyday life, I just my everyday life

Everyday is just another struggle so I continue to hustle
And if I don't bubble man Imma need a muzzle
Man this dogs out the cage  enraged with my twelve gauge
Hunting for them better days not giving fuck if I die today
Not gettin no love anyway
This bitch is where I play and make my pay
I'm life my father so they say but anyway
I'm a heartless insane ghetto hoodlum(H.I.G.H.L.A.N.D)
That's how I'm livin man my soul is what I'm given
While I'm barely missing prison and these niggas want me missing
That's the stresses that I'm dealing with that hater shit
Fuck a bitch and enemies and envy
