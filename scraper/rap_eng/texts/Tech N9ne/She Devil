[Intro]
And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her to Adam
And Adam said: "This is the bone of my bones, and the flesh of my flesh"

[Girl:] I want you to take this
[Tech N9ne:] What is it?
[Girl:] Something that'll make you feel real good
[Tech N9ne:] Aw, damn, girl, give it here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Often they blow your top
Watch when they hold your jock
Shocked when they're not sold crotch and you lost composure
Soft for the hoes, you're not stocked for the row
You walk for the hot shot wanna cop and do lots of dosia
She-devil, her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devil's eye
They call girl and strip, they all twirl and trip
In y'all world and dip and all thorough and hip
Hustlers, they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up, throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get you I'm 'bout to strap it down
'Cause by the time I tippie-tow in your cappy town
I got to have it now
Tech N9ne, it's a habit, got to stab it, I'm a savage hound
She-devils are incredible out for thy dough
Where the krilla is skrilla, X and tapes of Tae-Bo, yo

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Sin with me; I warn you)
She Devil's in the house lemme here ya
(Heeyyy) Off top I gots to get near ya (x2)

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck
Bitch that's why I'm paying you 150 bucks
(How much for me and my man?) To suck, me and Kuniva
Let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm bonin' crazy, [?] to 48
Ever since we've fucked I've been coughing and losing weight
Stank ho', trying to creep
Bitch pick up your son, he been at school for a week (Mommy!)
You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap your ass, leave you lost like Kelly without Destiny
You stank trick, you suck dick
Jason Williams, (Whaddup?) Shoot this dirty bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kuniva]
This devilist bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time
That I bust a nut she's like a succubus
A nymphomaniac laying me back on the filthy mattress
Cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels
She doesn't have a pivot I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking the pastor's cash
Got him on tape suckin' your tit, snortin' and passin' hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass lickin' maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fuckin' 30 kids

[Verse 4: Kon Artis]
Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to your lex, it's grindin' every kick
Two fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me, your man's fucking her trick
(You don't care) if she know I trip
But she's starting to get hip to it
'Cause she's finding matches inside of my pockets that say I strip
Which means I might get caught, lose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car, I know this sounds bizarre
But we should give her a call, and see if she want in
That way it's three-way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before, don't act like you haven't whore!
I'm 'bout to lose my wife I can't afford a divorce!

[Hook] x2

[Verse 5: Swift]
Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning in your clowning
So basically bitch you a damn fool
And that's a given fact
Plus I remember back when you was young
I could see a 100 niggas through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, that's embarrassing
You stuck with 30 children, 70 miscarriages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it, but you did

[Verse 6: Proof]
Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free, it's better that she (tranquil)
Even her apple, my cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the Glock at them, kings in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel, skeezin' is natural
You just my (ho') that's the reason you stack dough

[Hook] x2

[Outro]
[Tech N9ne:] Shit, this feels good baby, whatchu say this was again?
[Girl:] Don't worry about it, just relax
[Tech N9ne:] Ooooo.. Here, let me lick on this
[Girl:] It's gonna cost you
[Tech N9ne:] I got all of it, baby
[Girl:] Well, that's exactly what I need
[Girl:] All of it (*repeated until fade*)
