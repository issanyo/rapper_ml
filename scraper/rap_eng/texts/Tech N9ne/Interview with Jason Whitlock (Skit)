(Jason): (I.. and i appreciate you answering the questions i had about Genius and i dont want to try your patience but, there's some questions i've been wanting to ask you about Tech. So how do you react to people that say you, Kutt, Scoob, that y'all working alongside a Devil worshipper. What about the Strange Music symbol being a snake and a bat, some people say that the S and the M stand for Sadomasochism and the barcode cross that means the evil is god.)
[Krizz]: [I mean..] (How do you explain that?) [I mean, man, I questioned him using a snake, which is a serpent like the Devil, a bat which is a creature of the night, you know what im saying, and even a cross, you know what im saying, but that's Tech man, he's crazy, we just let him do what he do man.]
(The numbers 6688846993.) [I mean, that means NNUTTHOWZE.] (How does those numbers mean NNUTTHOWZE? Explain to me.)
[You gotta Look on the phone N-N-U-T-T-H-O-W-Z-E, it just means NNUTTHOWZE, I think people try to make this thing more than it is man.]
(Those numbers if you add them up, 6+6+8+8+8.., if you add them up it equals 67) [Right.] (And you know tech is always saying that he's all 6's and 7's) [Yeah.] (You know some people say he's trying to say that 6 is evil, 7 is godly you know Anghellic the name of his album originally saying that's good and bad and he might have been saying that evil is god the whole time, are you missing this?) [This is Tech provoking y'all man, and y'all fall for it] (Ok, your music is really starting to spread all across the world) [Yeah?] (You know you make the Paid Dues Festival, Rock The Bells with Nas and Damian Marley, you're touring overseas uh, it seems there's no limit to the success you guys are having and you're in the middle of a recession having this kind of success) [I mean, there's lots of businesses achieving right now dude we are...] (Let's just write this off as Tech N9ne and he's so super talented, you know, you might need to look deeper Krizz, man, you know, who, what are you following?) [Hey man, I gotta' go man, this's to much for me.]
