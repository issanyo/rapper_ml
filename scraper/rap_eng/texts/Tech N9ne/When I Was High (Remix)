Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Top of tha mornin! Poppin' a molly hella losin' my serotonin
But a brotha was zonin' na na nanana
Spendin' money for flown in na na when I'm high
Boning, neva callin home, and I was roamin'
Cellular phone gone [?] at the moment
Was on a pill and I was the real deal
Neva got ill will, like David in Kill Bill
Was hangin' on chill hill, and aimin' for mill scrill
And takin' the pill 'til I was to feel ill
(Then bounce back...)
A newly wed blew it!
Wasn't a possible way to truly get through it
Waking up inside of the home of a Juliette Lewis
Who be that foolish on the gooey wet fluid?!
A-C-I-D, crazy might be, but the ladies like me
To throw man wood, a program hood, the snowman could

Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Yeah! LSD and Special K
You ever stayed awake for 7 days straight up in a bed awake?
Laying next to your girlfriend tryin' your best to fake?
Like you asleep, when you really geek, you meditate?
Hoping to slow your heart rate down, but that you can't escape?
You ever played on methamphetamine?
Ever take Xannie bars and crush 'em up?
Just to put something up?
My nostril [?] caught me up on the sofa and I done it up
Rubbing it on my gum, it’s like my tongue wasn’t numbing up
Partyin' like the sun isn't coming up, I was in a rut
If I was a runner-up I was stuck on that hard shit
A [?] start to feelin' my heart clench
Developed an arm twitch, I had a Ray Charles itch
Surrounded by darkness, but I'm moving at light speed
Everyone saying it’s down here, but I need
To go and blaze up, 'cause I hate when the high leaves
Cause life seemed so damn good

[Hook: Nikkiya]
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high

[Verse 3: Nikkiya]
They say don’t do drugs
And they say don’t get high
So I'm in my mamas room
Sneaking here supply
Cause her doctor
Gave it to her
And I'm gonna go
And get me some
Cause I wanna get high
Cause I wanna get high
Cause I be stressed
And I don’t wanna cry
I'd much rather be happy
Even if it isn’t ?
So I did drugs
And I should of gave hugs
But whatever I did it
I smoked it
And I know it seems wrong
But

Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
Life seemed so damn good when I was high
