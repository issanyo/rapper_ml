[Hook]
They think they know me but they don't (x5)

[Tech N9ne]
Yeah
Sit up in front of me thinking you know me it's baloney
Cause you don't even know the bit of it homie
I'm the opposite of phoney you faking and you could never get it on
Cause all I be with is really a zombie
You chump, never to fight back
Living your life in punk gimme the mic back
Taking your woman to punk, giving the nightcap
Pump, digging in nice fat
Nada cause I'mma get it my money nigga do you like that
I don't even fuck around with a nigga thinking he knowing
What I'm thinking, how I'm living
Stupid is what he showing
Talking bout I'm a devil worshipper but nope
I can murder you serving your purpose
You're dead on the curtain I'm on it

Making Nina hit the street with the fo-fifth, and cock it
Looking for the nigga that's more bitch, and pop it
Put it to your face and it's oh shit, the rockets
Living nigga shivering and so sick, they're nauseous

I'm the one with the pump in the trunk
If you wanna try me nigga I'm willing and ready to jump
So when you see Tecca Nina up in the scene mane
Known that we can bust a ting tang, walla bing bang
