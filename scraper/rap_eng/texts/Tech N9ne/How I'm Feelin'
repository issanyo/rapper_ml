[Intro: Navé Monjo]
Yeah, yeah, Nave Monjo, ooh
Creep, creep, creep

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Did it all on purpose (purpose)
Stepped up in their building, make 'em nervous (creep, creep)
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurkin'
Spillin' all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange (real strange)
When I look around, I see real things
If you mad, get out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
Bitches, I don't feel 'em
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is how I'm feeling, that 'Bou Lou gonna give me a billion
Inshallah run it back, Lord willin', I'ma be off on an island chillin'
I came a long way from dope dealin' and I still run with the 5-6 villain
We live life like it ain't no ceilings, never been a limit Tecca Nina be killing, ah
I feel like break-dancin'
'Cause I got every bitch in the place straight glancin'
While they next to they lover lookin' at me, hate stancin'
But I'm always with niggas just like a fake klansman
How I'm feeling is people keep usin' identical syllables
Switch it up a little bit I'm feeling that often this pattern is the only one feelable
To the masses, perhaps to the people not needin' variety
Since the umbilical, don't hate the mirror so
I'm just a rapper that happens to kill a bro
When I be clappin', your cap is so peelable, ah

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Did it all on purpose (purpose)
Stepped up in their building, make 'em nervous (creep, creep)
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurkin'
Spillin' all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange (real strange)
When I look around I see real things
If you mad, get out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
Bitches, I don't feel 'em
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling

[Verse 2: Snow Tha Product]
Snow ayyo be the one all of these bitches be talkin' about (yeah yeah)
First they be throwin' them shots and then they wanna talk it out (yeah yeah)
Hold on bitch lemme, find out you ain't know facts (yeah yeah)
And I'm still this cold with the bars tryna get me to backtrack 'Cause you know I still rap but I get that bag and then I go sing
And then I come right back and I let that stack and the bell go 'ding'
And a bitch get slapped and I know it's gon' sting when you hoes hear that
It ain't mumble rap if you hear me clearly
I rap better than you boys and you gettin' weary
'Cause I hit a little melody and I know you hear me
With your dumb-ass, only smart people feel me
'Cause I been out here killin' that rap, it's just that I be lookin' up to Kaliko
Most of you bitches that been rappin' fast, garbage as fuck, I'm a whole different animal
Lately these bitches be jockin' me hard, hear it all in they song, so I shook 'em again
But when they ask if I'm still goin' off, on you bitch I'm a monster don't ever forget, ho

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Did it all on purpose (creep, creep)
Stepped up in their building, make 'em nervous (creep, creep)
Better cuff your bitch 'cause she lurkin'
Spillin' all these drinks that I purchased
Yeah, something real strange (real strange)
When I look around I see real things
If you mad, get out your feelings
'Cause this is how I'm feeling

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
Bitches, I don't feel 'em
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling (yeah)
Bitches, I don't feel 'em
This is how I'm feeling
This is how I'm feeling
