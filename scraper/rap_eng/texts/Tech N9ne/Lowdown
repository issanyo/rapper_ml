[Verse 1: Darrein Safron]
Yeah, we gon' run far outside in time
Oh, never do lie, never do lie
I never do lie
I put this on my soul to see your face light up
Get them people out our way
And in time they'll feel our pain, break out them chains

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Mama would have killed me (Christ)
Stepdaddy would have killed me (Islam)
If they both knew I chose a side
That would put me off up in a ride
With bloodthirsty killers inside
For my nigga Scoob, riding with the whoopty whop
To try to shoot the block then when the Uzi flocks
And this nigga named Crazy one day robbed my homie with his babies
For a lot of gravy God saved we
Found nobody to put on the news
Flame scatter brain splatter look like Jamba Juice
And we all intelligent but this shit is irrelevant
When they rob a real one for the hell of it
Yeah we gonna shoot
Cause we coming from the ghetto
Where you can die over jealousy or dinero
Women not having had extended like a sombrero
KC we never hesitating to let the metal go
And they bring us down to they level (demons)
And they taking fifty rounds from a rebel
That's the sound of the Devil's (semen)
Spreading round making little ones
And mamma's on the ground cause they killed her son, grieving
Yeah I chose a side but I flow now
It don't matter Nina, it can still be a showdown
Anywhere you go now
So you better stand yo ground
Cause they don't wanna see you climbing
They wanna keep you low down

[Pre-Hook: Darrein Safron]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Hook: Darrein Saffron]
Yeah they wanna keep us low down
Yeah they wanna keep us low down
Yeah they wanna keep us low down
Yeah they wanna keep us low down

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
They wanna see me falling like the rain drops
It's not that I won't, that I can't stop
Keep my brain locked on the game
Put the pad away when the paint stop
Cause they don't care if you slang rocks
All on the same block
Even if you're in Adelaide or in Bangkok
Bussin, spreading your city name like Chiddy Bang
But really they were sleeping and unaware of what it became
What will it take
I'm building my way into real estate
While you Philly steak children get really baked
I'm here to facilitate a setting to celebrate over Dilla J
Silver gorilla, mister vanilla face kill the brake
A beat drop and you feel the bass, exhilarating
Sleep on me, I'll slip in your pillowcase
They want to mitigate the buzz that we generate
And give us as little pay as possible any given day
They want us low down, dirty and shitty shame
Cause if anybody profound go head and give me fame

[Pre-Hook: Darrein Safron]
