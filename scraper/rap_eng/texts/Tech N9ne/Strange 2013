[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Let's get it!
Fredwreck, Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, Tech N9ne, and Mister Jim Morrison

[Hook: Jim Morrison & Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(I been a nobody, but now I get it in)
Strange days have tracked us down
(Nowhere to run, what I did is keep it wicked real and never to pretend)
They're going to destroy
(Everything in my path I'mma gas, I'mma spit it to the end)
Our casual joys
(I'mma take away your everything, I'mma merk it a bit when I begin)
We shall go on playing
Or find a new town
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
In the beginning it was negative wasnâ€™t nobody checkin'
Or steppin' to this heavenly sick brethren, it's
Tech's veteran, better than clever man
You're gonna be off of your rocker when the chakra's on chopper, it's
Kinda funny having no money coming up
The number-one independent rapper, people running up
When the fact I'mma sum it up, way way back I was run amuck
Now I'm beastin' the nation, cheese generatin'
Now everybody know when the flame sprays
Fame pays, maintain brain crazed
Leaving them all leaking in pain, hey gang, wait
Get ready for Strange days

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I told them I was gonna ball for y'all
Did it all, they didn't wanna get involved at all, yeah
They said that I was gonna fall, but now I'm walking tall
They all saw wicked raw a stud yeah
Everybody will applaud the odd lyrical god
The fraud better kneel before Zod, yeah
Never ever will I dissolve, I'm a hog in the dark
So when they call, I'mma maul and claw, yeah
Wanna hate me, industry gotta face me
They be shaky, ladies say we may be the crazies
They hella Gacy, John Wayne the case be
The industry fake, soft and sweet like pastry
Look at all these mentions
Look at all this uber attention
'Member everybody saying that I wasn't gonna make it
But the Tecca Nina kept on inchin'
This ain't no dang phase
Never will my reign fade
On the come up and a one up on 'em
Man, it feels good to finally see Strange praised

[Outro: Jim Morrison & Tech N9ne]
Strange days have found us
(This is the trip)
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
(The best part I, really really like)
Bodies confused
(6, 7, Tech N9ne!)
Memories misused
(Fredwreck, Thank you brother!)
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone
