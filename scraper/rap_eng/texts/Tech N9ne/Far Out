[Intro]
The following entry has... uh... seen mankind complete
Its first evolutionary steps into the universe
Leaving the planet Earth and going forward into the universe

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Tech N9ne]
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out

[Verse 1: J.L.]
Find me, I'm off in low Earth orbit
I'm far out, know I'm talking 'bout gotta get rid of
Your gravity to come towards it
I skyscrape, jump up in a cloud and absorb it
Rain down on you niggas like a storm hit
I'm headed for money and I'm sure of it, important
You know that I am dumb fresh, super fly, stupid high
About business like suit and tie
Trying to get paid like that YouTube guy
I'm one of them dudes, that get to running your dudes
You gotta give him his dues, I'm incredible
You never gonna fill in my shoes
The unforgettable truth is
I'm a beast when I get in this booth (Ah)
OK, OK, they know me, now don't they? I'm glad to say
Tech gave me the track and turned me loose like "JL, bomb away"
So you know I gotta do it like I'm spazzin'
I really get it crackin', never would've imagined, back when
I was on the block, I'd be rappin'
With one of the illest niggas ever to make it happen
I'm off to my zone, that's that fly zone
I don't give a damn about a hater, I'm gone
Eyes on the motherfuckin' prize and
I won't get disturbed and come down from my throne
B. Hood, full effect Strange, you digging it?
We living it up, man, it's all about the bigger shit
Ready for the benefit, hands in the air if you feeling it
Why would anybody wanna do it any different?

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Tech N9ne]
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out
With the superstar route, I can take it far out
Hey, I'm far out, off the chain
Took the star route, I done lost the plane
I spit the bars out with the quick in our mouth
Get to flipping the tip of the lip and take the dart out

[Verse 2: P.R.E.A.C.H.]
I think I fit this track so perfect
Tecca Nina gave me a chance and I deserve it
I been putting in my work in, cutting it like a surgeon
Urging my people to rebel like an insurgent
I grab my sword and shield, jump in the field
To feel my enemy's pain, the look in his eyes, surprised
Realized denied by the stand up guy
You don't really want it with me, please don't try
(Wait a minute, aren't you that Romanian guy?)
Damn right, dirty, you can bet your life
And now it's time for me to make a sacrifice
So leave it like I see until my afterlife
If this is wrong, then I can't be right
They wanted me dead, but I stayed alive
Enemies who post like my favorite five
I'm dumping at 'em, then I wave bye bye
I'm off my noodle, ain't I?
And my secret ain't mine, gotta play fight
Ain't white, hate night in the daylight
You don't wanna be the one to catch that stain, right?
So please proceed with caution, and just don't speak too loud
'Cause they go headhunting, in the Mississippi you found
They say I'm far out, I'm a giant in this large crowd
Get the fire with my heart out
I feel your hatred like the far south
See the truth is everybody wants the money
But they faking to make it if you pay attention
Look at the way I'm coming out the middle of the map
And attacking the track with the ways of a gremlin

[Hook: Stevie Stone & Tech N9ne]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Sim-sim-salabim, that don't mean anything
But I can make it mean get a lot of green
And make everybody get up and sing with the Nin'
I'm a menace, they wanna put the Nina in Guinness
'Cause I'm in the percentage of killers who finish
Any nigga without a limit, they get it 'cause I'm sinister
This ain't a gimmick when I rip and damage a mimicker
I be like a meteorite, I'm blazing everything
In my way so quick, you hear me humming
But the scientists gotta get multi-million
Dollar machinery for me just to see me coming
I'm far out, look at the people with the eye of an eagle
Tech, now look at the steeple
It's Tecca Nina and B'zle coming to defeat and
Diminish an evil, hit you with the strength of a Diesel
I â€“ fifth street to Grain Valley, Spain to Cali
Can't hang if you ain't strange, nigga, bang bang, you in pain alley
Another dimension, you better repent
And you never ever let a nigga discover the tension
I gotta, sever the punk another was sent in to Allah
Given away today but the lynchin's tomorrow
Potato, on the end of a barrel, I pop it
And have a motherfucker living in peril
I damage a devil, never doin' it for dinero
I'm taken out of his body like a nigga's on Cuervo
Tecca Nina gets colder with them
That'll mean everyone of they whores kissed him
On the tip of his big one
Dig it because I'm truly beyond the solar system
