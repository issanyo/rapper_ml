[Verse 1: NessaSary]
Feeling like I'm under an attack
Life glitching up but I just wanna rap
Shit, I just want the racks
I just want the platform, I just want the plaques
I just wanna make it like Trey Songz
R.I.P. to the best like Trayvon
NessaSary, #TeamNessaSary Miley azonto
EP, give me something I could slay on I just wanna...
Be groovy, bitch!
Southside chick make groovy shit
I don't fuck with everybody, got a choosy clique
Spit quick, fire something like an Uzi clip
Still feel like I'm going insane in the membrane
Dumb shit, tripping over things that I can't change
So Cal, Tony! Toni! Ton√©! say it ain't rain
Dark days coming to the end, where the sun rays?

[Hook: NessaSary]
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up, turn this track up!
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up
Nigga fuck that, I just wanna be
Great! Great! Great!
Fuck that, I just wanna be
Great! Great! Great! Great!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm killin' the game and nobody's gonna debate
That it's not a sucka touchin' my persona for Pete's sake
So don't bother tryna battle because the drama he ate
Was enough to make you think Jeffrey Dahmer be fake and I get it
Why your woman and your mama breathe Yates
Cause when I come over they know I'm gonna beat brakes
Off of the punani when I hit the nana she shakes
And I get to watch it over cause in the sauna we taped!
I'm gonna be baked off of the feeling my marijuana leaf makes
420 nigga I'm goin' on a weed date it be Tecca & Nessa
We blowin' bomb in these states!
Nigga, no wonder he hates cause I got a cell pic from Lana D. Rey
And I spit the kinda terror that'll make Obama knees shake
Tecca Ninna I juh wanna be great!

[Hook: NessaSary]
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up, turn this track up!
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up
Shit, I just wanna be
Great! Great! Great!
Fuck that, I just wanna be
Great! Great! Great! Great!

[Verse 3: NessaSary]
I just wanna see my kids grow
They the motivation -- what you think I'm in the biz for?
Took over the game, see my name on the endo
Grinding like a bitch from the east to the west coast
Trouble on horizon, but I ain't got Verizon
You hear me? Let me say it loud, say it clearly
Back up out my shit before I smear thee
All over the ceiling
Guess it's just the way that I've been feeling
Really, danger here
Very NessaSary is the angle here
Think I'm ripping on a motherfucking banger here
Bout to make my pockets thicker than Topanga's hair
So snap the fuck out of it
Bitch, you was out of it
Turn the fuck up on the haters who doubted it
Never get tired of it, make mama proud of it
Take the game over, my team is undoubtedly...

[Hook: NessaSary]
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up, turn this track up!
I work so hard, it's fucking my back up
Been on my job, getting my stacks up
Niggas talking down, but bitch I'm back up
Bitches back up
And I told you that I wanna be
Great! Great! Great!
Fuck that, I just wanna be
Great! Great! Great! Great!
