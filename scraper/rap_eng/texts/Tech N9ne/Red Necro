Follow me into the world of racism

[Verse 1]
We're on the highway, rolling to Californ-I-A
Seven of us heaven love us 'cause it's evil in front of us
We must trust that G-O-D got our backs on this T-R-I-P
In the van we watchin' flicks and getting our kicks on Route 66
Forty West got us dozin', my eyes closin'
Almost on “E” and so we stop to get some gas
Somewhere outside of Arizona people's persona
Seem like they put niggas in a coma, or bullets in their ass
Fast I went in to what? To get some petroleum
Rodeo circus, these trashy motha fuckers
Trying to show me they tat's on purpose
Swastika's here, Swastika's there, minding my affairs
'Til one shoved me and I said, "aw this is lovely"
I punched him back and said take that from a black
His posse ran up I threw my hand up, said let loose the gats
They said, "We're the type of boys that kill 'coons by the hour
Nigger one God, one race, sieg heil, white power!"
I said "Fuck you. Bill Riccio, you spacey ho'
I heard racist were dying and I'm about to increase the ratio"
While we were scrappin' I heard, "coon, monkey, ape, baboon"
I heard my partner's lettin' loose they cleared the room
I let off a couple inside their racist encephalus
I asked God was I wrong for slaying demons and devils?
And if so, forgive me, but now it's 2 wounded and 3 dead
From shots to the head, these racist mother fuckers bled

[Hook]
Rednecks are the ones who bled next
First they used to hang us, now they get them heads checked
For bullets and abrasions, that evil persuasion
This is one of the many, many flaws of this nation

[Interlude]
"Watch that 'boy' shit redneck"

[Verse 2]
I'm just a hard workin' brother at Ford
Report to work pronto amigo in my raggedy Accord
Assembly working no smirking I get the job done
White folks staring at me like I was Dennis Rodman
Fuck it
It must be the bandana I wear, saying black owned
See them whispering everyday but they can yap, yap on
Saw it comin' a mile away and it figures
Somebody took a grease pencil and wrote on a car "Whites own Niggers"
Paid it no mind, now it's lunch time I'm eatin' quietly
Then a voice said "you don't belong in society"
I looked then I felt like gaggin' these white trash mother fuckers
I heard that he was the grand dragon
Fuck him, I'ma tag him, skull drag him
But his recruits equipped with steel toe combat boots
This is crazy for four hundred plus we've been infamous
Stigmatism is realism, the idealism is to hinder us
Put his fingers in my face I bent 'em back
He said, "you fuckin' jerk" and told me to watch my back after work
I punched out I walkin' to my car, I'm driving
And I see this mother fucker, he's following me from afar
Pulled over like an idiot jumped out and said, "what's happenin'!?"
We started scrappin' he cut me with his knife, I took his knife, there goes your life
God forgive me because I slit his redneck
Now all is left is the fuckin' dead peck

[Interlude]
"I sure do hate to see you like this, what if me and the boys was to shoot that nigger dead?"

[Verse 3]
The demons are gonna kill me, I feel it comin'
I'm a little piece of love, and a pit full of `em gunnin'
The pit is the planet, damnit it's full of killas and racists
If God make it I'm saying, God take it break it
Demoni-acs of all colors, Crippers and Blooders
Arian brothers die, If you fuck with any of us God lovers
A southern wind, hit the Midwest my mother cringed
'Cause her vocalist, keep fuckin' with white national socialists
Everybody wants to be the chosen God's people
When teaching hatred hatred, at the steeple steeple lethal sequels
When churches burn, we purchase germs
Like guns to slaughter all the mother fuckin' surface worms
Be warned, all fronts got the right to fall once
And the racist be the ones we call dunce, down to die!
For my love so before you cease us
You got to what? Crucify me like Jesus leave us rednecks

Season to kill evil
