[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Get off the seat of my pants
I wanna knuckle up, and beat em, I'm antsy
King of the jungle, I beat a chimpanzee
I never gave a single fuck on a man, see
Never ran the city of Kansas, banshee (new kid!)
But I been around her a minute
And then I did it all; I may not been all around the planet
And then I'm finna show 'em how ya make a novelty pop
When he go choppin' he's as hot as you can possibly stand it, but wait
Number one draft pick on Speedom, beat 'em
Niggas get they ass kicked when I see em we dumb
Get em in they plastic when I read 'em, keyed em
Sick of wack whack shit cried freedom, freedom
Thinking of mashed potatoes at night baby sick and I pass -aby maybe sipping on gas and they paid us delight
I might be giving a bath to my label, finger to my cable TV Kali Baby and I'm ready to fight an orangutan

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
He never did no harm to me
'Cause I could get free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious... orangutan!

[Interlude 1]
No killing what can't be killed

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Get off the dick of a nigga bigger than you
Getting money to hand me
You don't know me,  I pull up on the sansby
Pull out the jimmy, put it right where their hand be
Guns is handy, big as Michael Olowokandi
Can't stand me, plan to can me, dick damn (But I rock)
Holler if you find a nigga better, pull a hammy sammy be bout them fans but (he not)
Selling out to get a little cheddar in my land, a hand only that that man (and he drop)
And figure out what the eleventh letter is fam and animals is stand on (that Glock)
And cut the head off every little keffer
Black dynamite I'm running thangs, I don't bang but I got love from here to Inglewood to the Hunnid Gang
So that mean that I can hunt ya if I wantcha get a bunch of mandingos, amigos with gringos
If ya know me then ya know I gotta make feet step to the beat of my own damn drum
On some grown man stuff, never weak 'cause I beat you to the fleet all along ran come
Get ya funk ass up, get my secretary 30 dollars and I'm hollow, I'm living in the dirty water
Me and 40 Water only fat niggas that'll remain
Music, Strange - Orangutan!

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
He never did no harm to me
'Cause I could get free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious... orangutan!

[Interlude 2]
No destroying what can't be destroyed

[Verse 3: Godemis]
Ain't nobody here ready for the beheading
I'm bringing the Armageddon
They killing dead and then let 'em in
We put the pedal to the metal
It's W-T-F ever whenever they wanted you to edit in
Don't really matter what I say or what I be on
They knowing they can take it to infinity and beyond
They prayin' on my death, hoping that it wouldn't be long
But it could take an eon, no B-S so we gone

[Verse 4: Ubiquitous]
But we on speed, you couldn't get a lead on
I keep calm, rap fast and feast on
I heard, everybody gotta play the fool
In the jungle, nobody safe from the chain of food - you dig?
And I been cooking in the kitchen waiting on a couple things
That didn't come to fruition that we're doing this spring
You wouldn't think that rappers are really bitches
Strip 'em of all their riches and see what they can do in the ring
Scooby is big and Ubi is little
Both of us represent for the middle
Keep it Strange and doing it big
Louie the king, orangutan, usually
Hanging one-handed from a branch where you couldn't swing
Ha! And the view is insane
You never see it but believe it's a beautiful thing
I sped up speed, you seen I make it sin upstream
Live in a cage until the day they gotta give us free
I'm out

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Oh, let 'em out, let 'em out
Animal and he's circling about
Keep us free and it won't come out the mouth
Monkey do, monkey see, it's about to go south

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
He never did no harm to me
'Cause I could get free easily
Enough to make your heart go bad
Ferocious... orangutan!

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
Evolution is saying I come from monkeys
I don't know but what I do know is people get super jumpy
In every part of the country, they look at a nigga funky
Like I'm an alien baby and I get 'em all really grumpy
When I spit it, they don't want to admit it, but I shit it
Whenever I get to pivot up on the mic and I lit it
I get 'em livid, I do the impossible, fuck a critic
I tell 'em to kid-iss my did-dick you bid-itch

[Verse 6: JL B.Hood]
Yo, come and witness the animals on exhibit
We taking over the planet and all of the outer limits
They hand me they will and really ain't gotta be reinvented
With the pen it's a picture being plotted
You couldn't mimic
I'm p-equitable, service I'm in a tin and let him out like Krizz
Hanging off of the tree, but I'm hanging
Chest banging indestructable
Diamonds on display and see us swinging
On the monkey bars, who let an orangutan in?

[Verse 7: Wrekonize]
Pongo, banging on the bass of the bongos
Deep in the Congo, strapped up with a longbow
Soon as we get to rockin', I be up in the Times bro
'Cause I'm an animal, happy to damage the stronghold
Why you gotta be knocking the ooo-wee switch?
We get it poppin', more than often and you do eat shit
Hit the drop and motherfuckers chop-suey prick
This our planet goddammit, King Louie, bitch

[Verse 8: Rittz]
Somebody better tell 'em watch the throne
I come outta nowhere with a knockout like Holly Holm
You on top now, not for long
The name's Strange, rang bells worldwide
But you hardly known
I'm balling on 'em like I'm Karl Malone
My swisher looking like a waffle cone
But all my homies know I came to drink
These rappers thinking we the same, we ain't
I might jack the track while you just back up
Sang Jermaine, I'm an orangutan
