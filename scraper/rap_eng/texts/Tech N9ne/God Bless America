[Intro: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, it's taking a lot for me to give y'all all of me
For y'all to take it and run with it
And turn it into some shit that it's not

[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, exceeded my expectations a while ago
They wondering why Dizzy the one that's always smiling for
I listen a lot and look at everything I done accomplished, mane
Still, my baby girl and son is the main thing that I value most
Family, fuck a xanny, I'm puffing on this flower though
You piece of shit, no thang, we keep it lit
No hard feelings, don't ever change, don't ever quit
When I found out living legends still exist, I knew I had to commit
So I heard that this new generation was waiting on me
After The Golden Age, these old heads been praying for me
To get involved, maybe vent to y'all, and make an impact
Better plant a seed and water that bitch and watch it grow
Now how many times I gotta say it? I been down and out
But you only get so many chances till you're fouling out
And I'm like, "Let me live without taking no breaths"
My mind is focused on which task I'm finna take on next, uh
I think back when I just hung with my dawgs
My mama could never keep a man 'cause we was running him off
Needed a father figure but I don't like how he coming across
He end up gone, she was sad but I felt like that's his loss
I told her, "Never bend your head, look the world straight in the eyes"
"You deserve love, but a queen don't need a king to survive"
And it's a blessing to be able to rap and not feed y'all lies
Or fake my happiness like everything's just fine
I mean, we all human beings but we not alike
'Cause the loudest on the Internet get to sleep through a quiet night
It's a big difference and it's teaching me a lot about who we are, how like
Money don't change people, it just bring out who they truly are
Man, I done seen the most from coast to coast
They got us crossing over the border line
I don't got all the answers but we need to be more organized
So here's a little enlightening for your peace of mind
Everything you need in this life you live will come at the perfect time
So God bless America

[Chorus: Chel'le]
In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just lack the trust (trust!)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Uh, follow me, follow me through the hardships
Pardon my need to be swift with how I start this speech
Who you more like? Malcolm or Martin?
The game that they play with us, brother, don't have no cartridge
Button mashers, disaster casters, they ass backwards
I might slave for a meal but you ain't my master
Running through the field, all I hear is laughter
'Cause them chains that kept us here can no longer capture
The heart of my folk, foot on my the throat of my oppressor
For all of them ropes, they tied a tree for my ancestors
If limbs could talk, they'd cry for days
Sad, they gave all they had but couldn't break under pressure
Blood on the leaves, Glock on the dresser
Them laws plotting, protect and serve but I know better
The news a lie, to you and I, TV ain't real
So don't you try, to be like none of them Housewives
Selling us fools' gold
Tell a son to slang dope and daughter twerk when they get old
Damn shame, how we find time to sit around
Smoking and dranking, while they corporate banking
Don't be content with the hood, nigga, what is you thinking?
I got a small violin if you don't vote for complaining
About the government, stand up on some brother shit
And stop being on some other shit, God bless America

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Despite all the barriers
If you do whatever you do every day
You can get it
I did it

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
From the poorest, they said I gotta push for all my dreams and they flourished
Then a forest full of obstacles, I got the dope 'cause I'm morest
Don't ignore it, that I built this vocab without a thesaurus
When the war is pressing, they be asking me questions like Katie Couric
Like, "Did you sell dope when you fell broke?"
Tryna stop a male's hope who never dropped the jail soap
Made it up out of Hell's scope, they ask, can I spell "vote"?
I'm feeling like they tryna tell jokes, Chappelle wrote
I'm a U.S. citizen escaping the penitentiary they hid us in
The kid has been fitted to quit and then spit it and shit again
But I became noble and well-rounded like an oval
Never will I be grounded for disposal
Everybody be astounded by the mogul, Tech N9ne!
No more saying, "I can't afford this"
Even when I was down, my plan was to never abort this
Don't forget, they said I sold my soul, that's horse shit
'Cause I simply thought my way onto the Forbes List
So God bless America

[Chorus: Chel'le]
In God we trust
Born in royalty, they can't take that from us
No matter what, runs through our blood
We have the power, we just lack the trust (trust!)
Just have your faith and believe
Keep calm, my young kings and queens
Watch and you'll see, and when that day comes
May God bless America
