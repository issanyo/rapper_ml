[Hook: Sincerely Collins]
I been fuckin' grindin'
I been workin' every day for this
I be fucking shinin'
You should probably wear your shades for this
I be poppin' bottles in the club and I get paid for this
Ask me how I got it
I'mma tell you I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this

[Verse 1: Kap G]
I might pull up in a Wraith with this, go Valet with it
Heard little homie try'na save the bitch, try'na pay the hit
I can eyeball the gas, I ain't gotta wave us up
I ain't gotta pay the ville, Bootleg Kev and Jadakiss, yeah
I run the town, smoking on pound
You fuck with the family, they lettin' off rounds
Don't make a sound, I'm outta town
I'm with a foreign thang
Double cup, yeah I'm pouring drank
I'mma get that the lord rang
Choppers in like Tory Lanez

I was made for this, I was, I was made for this

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I was born with the recipe
That's why they can't mess with me
You already failed, soon as you thought about testing me
It's all in your hands, meaning you control your destiny
I was always taught to handle my business professionally
No you can't get next to me, if you broke especially
Only if you into moving weed, coke, or ecstasy
Hit 'em with the Mac, where the ambulance and stretchers be
Squeezin' in the back, you don't stand a chance in catching me
Shit ain't workin' out, switch your route, get a better team
Spend a lil' more, get some pure or some better green
Take a couple trips, see some shit that you've never seen
Yeah, it's M.O.B. but your family is everything
Ain't no need to hesitate, cock it back and let it go
Money gon' come, it's just up to you to let it grow
If I'm in it, then I own it, yeah I paid for this
Name's Jadakiss, I was made for this

I was made for this, I was, I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this
I was made for this, I was, I was made for this

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
All hail when the king is loose
Back in the day they told me that my dream is noosed
Like a rocket people seen it shoot
Even though the N9na took the scenic route
Now you witnessin' the meanest muse
On the planet, dammit I'm the cleanest ooze
Now the women with the Venus boost
Or Serena's want the N9na's penis juice
I done came a long way, this hombre
Never do let the song play the wrong way
Tech on the microphone spray, they gon' say
He goin' out for the strong way, and that's the realest
Now the haters saying Tech's the illest
After not believing he done connect with skrillas
Eclectic killas and wordplay
You gonna survey what can never be seen
Not invisible per say
But unfuckwithable, some bust pitiful
Whoever thinking it's me better come suck genitals
One tough general, make a hater
They wanna run stuff plentiful
Become stuck clinical
Wondering how I keep emerging on virgins
To rhythm and rhyming, I am a surgeon
Ya heard when the N9na got the words in with the Persians
A burden to all of the newbies that don't deserve 'em
We serving
Now ain't that a kick in the head
Who gave the brain scatter, click in the red
Remains are gonna spatter really creaking ya dead
Now my dick and my spread, took a bitch in my bed nigga
I get the chunk and then I blade the bitch
Kev ain't never gotta pay for this
'Cause he take the risk and a 100% for knowing Tecca N9na for real and that he made for this, nigga
