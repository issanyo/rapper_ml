[Verse 1]
Hit 'em up with a big fat M-W for the Midwest
Them who come and test then end up with a big mess
They laughing at you, not me, 'cause if so they have no clue
Wanna happen let loose the Kraken, when I'm all on that Caribou Lou
[?]
[?] cheesin' bitches wanna listen
To me get my quota, now that I'm older
My shit is colder, then circle city Minnesota
I can flow, the kingdom come bring dem some things
That sling rings around fiends unseen we from
Show me foreign like Mitsubishis
'Cause we are the species, those who be rollin' up in Niecie's
Prospect check, 5-7 and 20 minus 11
N9ne crushin' niggas who said I wasn't bustin'
They said I couldn't flow and now I'm a sinner bust
To those who said I shouldn't hold my breath because

[Chorus]
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
[?] stuck in a middle
You don't wanna make me have to pass out you
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
Nnutthowze dwelling, pockets swelling
Because I'm doing what I have to do
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
816 ways to die, it's up to you
What you wanna do?
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
What? The M-W said to trouble you
Hit 'em up

[Verse 2]
I've got problemos, them hoes tripping with me demos
Fuck it, win those dollars coming in with them limos
They think not 'cause they think we at homes like the Wizard of Oz got
So we throw up the opposite of shazbot
Let 'em know, Missouri ain't the green
[?] and hickish wallpaper and town that you're savoring
[?] niggas with lyrics
If you ain't real I mob ya
Can't stop a real Nicaragua
It's all delicious, no need to be suspicious
This is not a fictitious song full of glitches
This is neglected rapping with flows perfected
Brown complected nigga who's dropped from Perspective
Much love to Jimmy J and Terry Lew
Gave me the chance to do my witchcraft my trickery, my voodoo new
Lyrics now, we used to lay 'em down In L.A
Every single day at least them niggas didn't say

[Chorus]
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
[?] stuck in a middle
You don't wanna make me have to pass out you
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
Nnutthowze dwelling, pockets swelling
Because I'm doing what I have to do
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
816 ways to die, it's up to you
What you wanna do?
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
What? The M-W said to trouble you
Hit 'em up

[Verse 3]
I can give a tihs
If a aggin' wanna spit about that Tech en9n
That making his way to the top roof rof
Permanent not tihs
Like chasing them clocks
They don't understand that [?] dog [?]
NOFX, flex like chapped lips on blisters
Turn female restrooms unisex
Getting relish no matter whatever I gotta do
Had a few Caribous [?]
Coming up out my trap like that, laugh at this
Better really come with it, steppin' into my vast abyss
Master this if not laugh at them
Have 'em off in the trunk with a right pack and I'll be like Slim
[?] ain't even heard the last of me
You say I'm country so you think they gonna laugh at me
[?] have a blast with me
I'm ripping ass, nigga, that's the way it has to be (Has to be)
'Cause we the party people night and day, bianc
Living crazy is the only way, bianc
If you ever diss these licks that I spit
We can flow any day wack or even tight either way

[Chorus]
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
[?] stuck in a middle
You don't wanna make me have to pass out you
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
Nnutthowze dwelling, pockets swelling
Because I'm doing what I have to do
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
816 ways to die, it's up to you
What you wanna do?
(They're all gonna laugh at you!)
What? The M-W said to trouble you
Hit 'em up
