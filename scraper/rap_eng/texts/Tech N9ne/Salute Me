[Intro]
Salute me, salute me, salute me, everybody salute me
Trak Starz, Tech N9ne, At All Costs, Tali Blanco

[Verse 1: Tali Blanco]
Star status, and I ain't hit the solar system
Niggas rocking with me so you know I rollin' with them
Roll a blunt that’s probably longer than your ho extensions
Going this fucking hard you know I should have been on
The BET Awards or something
Instead of spitting bars for nothing
Man, do I work this hard for nothing?
Nah, I gotta amount to something
I made this for everybody who said I ain't gon' be shit
But now you see this, I am the shit
Making hella moves and most of them are accidental
I’m eatin' major motherfuckers all coincidental-
Ly, me? I just happen to rap
And if I happen to not make it then it's back to the trap
I'm cool with that, see I been out here for a long long time
Man, the money only thing that's on my mind
Now, pussy nigga, salute me

[Hook: Tali Blanco]
See I'm the man right now
And everywhere I go, they tryin' to shake my hand right now
Hold up, hold up, see I'm the dude right now
And you can tell by the way niggas salute right now
Salute me (x9)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
That's right, that's right, I been the man since I started
Back in the '85 when I ripped it live
Anybody wit' eyes on me lookin' at me like I farted, loud
Ever since that time been rocking crowds
With the style so wicked and wild
I'mma put that moment on them like POW!
So sick on the floor, this genre
Bout to get a bit of dope shit from the bloke with honor
You don't wanna provoke this llama, bro, just calm ya!
Or you gonna hear "Dasvidaniya", no kiss mama!
Salute me, everybody wanna recruit me
Got the woman shakin' her booty, wanna gave me the coochie
Tecca Ninna, I'm Gucci, I don’t calmly ink
I just murder and get ornery thinks
I don’t even drink Jäger no more
Cause them white motherfuckers kept buying me drinks!
Cause I'm famous, like Amos
You wanna bang this? I'm the strangest
Can't tame this, no laws or limits in my language
I see the pen, it be asking me to sin
You don't want me to flex it cause it's "Bye-bye niggas!"
Auf Wiedersehen!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tali Blanco]
I be all on my B-I, bitches all on my D-I
My businessman swag got 'em looking like I'm T.I
See, I, be up on my grown man B-I
And I'm so fly, these bitches think that I
Am they whole sky, like no lie
I'm a Big Mac and you's a small fry
Sipping on some shit the color of an orange soda
I'm like "Oh", I, really don't even know why
Those guys, gon' try, to be like us, my swag is rollercoaster
Waka Flockin' the holster, transportin' this coca
Powder packs in the chocha, move 'em from coast to coast-ah
Throw the pills in this blow-ah, baby that's all I know now
Roscoe Dash, I'mma show out, grindin' until it's over
Told 'em, see, me, I just happen to rap
And if I happen to not make it then it's back to the trap
I'm cool with that, see, I been out here for a long long time
And the money only thing that's on my mind
Now, pussy nigga, salute me

[Hook]
