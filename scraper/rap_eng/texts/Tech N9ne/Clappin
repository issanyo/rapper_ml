[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Tech N9ne here baby
Tech N9ne!
On a track with George Zelaya nigga
Strange Music and Undercast doing thier motherfucking thang
See them asses clappin' in the club baby

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
Clappin' and clappin' I love the way you keeping it crackin' up on my lap I got it poppin' I'm a soldier
Making it happen a nigga bust a nut from the back I flip it over now her leg is on my shoulder

[Verse 1: George Zelaya]
The booty was so fat
I really had to go and hold that
Man I was trippin the way she was giving it to me I had to go get it got her on my dick and I let her control that
And they say that imma ho cat
And I ain't trippin off no cat
And I'm gonna get it regardless
What they say cause I ain't never been the type of motherfucker that pay for no cat
I came without my people wanna castrate music from me all up in the front cause you know we gonna be watching her
Don't never hypnotize never look her in the eyes all im tryin to see is what it is the next drinks rockin' her
They know that i've been drinkin so what up to my thinkin he's out taking his bitch home so I can rock her
All up in my business and she got the wish not to break the shit and she wanted to do the clapper
Said she wanted to give it to me non stop wanted to shake it the way she makes that booty pop
Clappin' and clappin' she love the way that a rap it then grab it got to hit it with the beezy on top
Murder the clit every time I run up in the spot crippin' the hips up before I'm ready to pop
Sprung for my tongue and the way she put it on me gotta love it cause she always keep my dick on rock what

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Nigga tonight imma kick it when the crew be out
Hoping Seattle can show me what the nudy 'bout
Hit the club and I want to get with the bianca that give it to me you know I take it right up out the booty house
To the taily then I skeet on the belly nobody can tell me nothing when I be fucking with the chakras
Send her back to the club in a cab and I give her back to a nigga Tech Nina already done popped her
Making it clap we all up in the back with fat stacks of cash I gotta smack the ass
Fantasizing about [?] I got the laugh making the N9ne I got ta clash
We gettin' hyphy oh I think she like me baby you bug a nigga to say that so very nicely
Kickin' it hella incredible follow up and tell a ho to get with it with nothing on but the nikes
It was fantastic, her and her home girls choke on my dick pulling it like elastic
Came all over the place in a space like deoxyribonucleac acid
When I bang she was ready to lake placid
Pussy came I think she really blew a gasket
Sorry n' shit we know that when you party with this strange nigga when he flippin' the undercast shit

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]

[Verse 3: George Zelaya]
We just keep on clappin we up in the place acting a fool how we was distractin beautiful booty factors
I was sipping on that jd, Tecca Nina on that malibu rum hammered bitches getting crazy, hop off that 151
Jd then I'm back on the stripper come for the check now she down on my zipper
Come to the booty house [?] go and get her get the bitch sprung just gave it a little pressure
Drink a bottle now she lookin like a model
Freaky white chick always make you wanna holla
Madinas in black and posted up in back the most beautiful ass that makes you wanna hear they holler
Look I'm a raw motherfucker and I end up in the dirt putting in hella work every time I fuck em in the squirt with a little hurt any position to make her twerk
I'm on the beautiful lady lumps under her skirt
Been a sucker for a lapdance hit it with my last chance had her clappin' and clappin' and clappin' on a hand stand
Thought I made it fast in wished I would of cashed in made her turn around and broke it off in the back
And I had to go and get it nonstop
Want ya to shake it the way she make that booty pop
Clappin and clappin she love the way that a rap it then grab it got to hit it with the beezy on top
Murder the clit every time I run up in the spot
Crippin the hips up before I'm ready to pop
Sprung for my tongue and the way she put it on me gotta love it cause she always keep my dick on rock what
