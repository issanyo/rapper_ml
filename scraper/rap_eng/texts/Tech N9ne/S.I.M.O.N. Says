[Verse 1]
Simon says I can make a grip if I unload this clip
And empty off in another, if I want to get paid
Ain't no games to be played
Scarface I watch on a daily basis
Smokin laces
Goin different places
Stickin millie in they faces
No cases
Lucky me
'Cause Simon said I'm gonna live through the shoot of sellin'
Big budda
Blunts big enough for a pharmaceutical distributor
Pimp you tha
Go down on how many words demanded me
And Bakari, Evil Ward, PKW
I ran this
My shit was landed
Playa vision was my decision
Fuckin' school 'cause my teachers a fool for followin' rules
When I make that run, when I make that sound when I pop that gun
Leaving demons numb
Releasing faeces, piss and cum
Now my futures looking manic, satanic, forces ran it
Dammnit, I'm [?], straight up panic
And it don't matter none to me 'cause Simon got my head
I'm mentally dead
And I'll pump you full of lead
Just because Simon said

[Chorus]
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says

[Verse 2]
Bitches, Biancas, and Biatchresses is all the same
Simon says he already equipped me with hella game
What did he want from me?
Small deeds
And get nothing, but I'll run up in it, all creeds, planting the seeds
He said I can stick it with no protection
I know flection, with a ho with no J on my erection
It's not a good call, hittin' this fraud wall, I'm just an oddball
Running back and forth through Todd Hall
All, these bitches, swingin' on my inches
Thinkin that they gettin' white picket fences, on my expenses
Simon said no worries
Akuna Matata, but my dick is heated like an anchalota
Its gettin' hotta
Nobody move, nobody get burned
Bullshit if I more flex, I guess I'm on it when I get dressed in the latex
I bone it
But I don't cum
Niggas like me end up dead fucked up naked head
Just because Simon said

[Chorus]
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says

[Verse 3]
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
That's what S.I.M.O.N means
But I heard this voice say, "Hey Tech what about your dreams?"
Fuck that dreamin' and do this dirt, said that's how I'm gonna win
You gotta act like you want to be livin' fat like a Samoan
Could it be endless listening to Simon
This time I chose to kick rhymes
Get mines, the big times waitin' for me
Was tryin' to get signed
Heard my moms got a record deal with Jimmy Jam and Terry Louis
Prospective, now I'm the straight bomb
BOOM, in the face, I'm on the paper chase
Simon said he couldn't believe I resorted to rhymin'
Throw your shit together
No time for relaxin'
Time to go back to poppin' your 9 milli, jackin'
So what, I'm stuck, but, I'm hearing voices saying fuck that nigga named Simon
Get with a nigga named Diamond
And now, a nigga from the MidWest
Is 'bout to have these Biancas hearing me widespread
Fuck what Simon said

[Chorus]
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
Simon says
Sex, indica, money, obsession, neglect
Oh yeah
Simon says
