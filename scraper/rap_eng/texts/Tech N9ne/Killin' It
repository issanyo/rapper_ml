[Verse 1: Kalibur]
It's dark, take a walk with the firewalker
See the sky get darker, better hide your partner
It's no lie, I'm a guy that desires vodka
Live and die by the firewater
Can't crash on the path of an anathema
Took a bath in the plasma of dracula
Rip your whole shit in half like you africa
The aftermath of the wrath is a massacre
Dispersin perversions on persons who cursing aspersion
I'm tight like a virgin
The mic is my knife, I'm a surgeon
Provide a diversion - an unedited version
I gotta speak about a personal problem
I personally hate what commercial be offerin'
Anybody snappin' and leanin' and rockin'
I snap, and lean over and pop um
Cop it and rock it and chop it
I'm off in my whip hot boxin'my profit
When I really wish that I could just stop it
Taking a fifth to a swollen esophogus
My skin is my 'scar'cophagus
I been in since I dropped to metropolis
On one end I'm the end of men
But then again, I'm one of them - part of the populous
I don't care if you like it, the value's intrinsical
Comin'straight for your ventricle
You're gunna need mental and dental attention
You mess with the general
Cause I'm Ill, no subliminals
Anybody coulda been a body, man
The millimeter coulda been a shotty
Catchin wreck with Tech
On direct effect with an erect defect
Neck and neck with Beck and you can check the check

[Hook:]
We killin it
All hail to my homies cause we real in it
We killin it
Ain't givin a fuck if fakes ain't feelin it
We killin it
We used to be broke but now there's scrill in it
We killin it
Dago and Misery got that illest shit
We killin it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Tech N9ne, I'm a E-tard
I'm on tour with a get-drug-free card
7 bianca's, I got 'em in the room
One of 'em yours, you trip, get trouble with the b-guard
I keep Nicholas
He eat niggas like licorice
Quick to hit a bitch, he did it for the frick of it
Nigga you sick of it, get rid of it, commit the bitter shit
And it'll get wicked, I lick your chick and eat your ligaments
Fully automatic, stick it and get radical
Never collateral, I keep a knot
Cause of my grammatical, hella combat-able
Compatible with a breezy when I'm pushin up in the cock
When will it stop
Neva will it, nina gotta kill it when I pop
Killa killa, live sick and die nasty
Ghastly niggas put you in the crops
I don't know when I'll go
I don't know when my fans are sick of the MO flow
So I bust for the time bein', I crush the rhyme
Me and the beat is like a pimp and a ho
Cause I tell that bitch what to do
Whether to heat it up, speed it up, or screw
Hooker what u givin me, I'm into polygamy like a kennedy
And many be fuckin off with the crew
Nigga, I'm back with my family, Kalibur, Kostik
Holding emcees like Gahllager hostage
Stop it, throw them niggas in my moshpit
Watch a technician and juggalo squash it
If you enter the center, get mangled
Cause my mental is totally tangled
All my niggas is real in it, killin it
For the love of little baby Anghelle

[Hook:]
We killin it
All hail to my homies cause we real in it
We killin it
Ain't givin a fuck if fakes ain't feelin it
We killin it
We used to be broke but now there's scrill in it
We killin it
Dago and Misery got that illest shit
We killin it

[Verse 3: Kostik]
Raise up, K-Kos stay blazed up
On his way up
Muthafuckas betta pay up
Leave that ass layed up
Get away, cause we always tryna fade somethin
Ain't nothin
Cause u cats ain't sayin nothin
And they hide it by the way they stuntin
Stay frontin, say somethin
Dunk um in the ocean, Kos the waves comin
Head huntin
Meanwhile, kickin back in dago with strange
Sippin caribou lou
And to me, family means that whenever there's beef
I inheirit it to, embarrassin crews
How the fuck can you sit there and smile
And tell me that this shit ain't fire
And not to expect me to spit in your face and make you a liar
Can't even look in my eyes
Run up on us anytime, must be out your damn mind
Better get it right
Bout to get it hype
Roll up with the one and only and the n9ne
Now you dyin, what's that like
Seems like a small price to pay, heat it up like a microwave
Time for days, I kill it till there ain't no life to save
Now I'm doin it for hill and dayton, O.I, we made it
Promise to bring it every minute that I'm in it
Till I'm feelin that I did it and it's killed
If it it wasn't for the lyrics, ain't nobody tryna hear it
In the mirror only image that appears is myself
Never change for sales, I been rockin the bells
Put a cock in it, knockin it out
Drop in the towel
Ain't no crossin us now, better hop in the car and be out
Cause it's mine now
And you know you bout to find out, why don't you just die down
Livin sick until I sign out
Ride out, blow your mind out
Pull the blinds down, this is my house, get out
Comin straight over the ledge with a sledge to your head
Out the shed cause it's just too sharp
We be rippin it apart from the start
And ain't givin a fuck, way more than often, KOS

[Hook:]
We killin it
All hail to my homies cause we real in it
We killin it
Ain't givin a fuck if fakes ain't feelin it
We killin it
We used to be broke but now there's scrill in it
We killin it
Dago and Misery got that illest shit
We killin it
