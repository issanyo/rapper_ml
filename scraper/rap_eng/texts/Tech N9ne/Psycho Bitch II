"I think you're amazing, I think you're wonderful
I think you're amazing, I think you're wonderful
I think you're amazing, I think you're wonderful (What the fuck!)
(there you go again)
I think you're amazing, I think you're wonderful
You're incredible and I think you're amazing (What?) and I want you in my life forever (Hold on)
And we're gonna be great together
We're gonna be great together, we're gonna be great together
We're gonna be great together, we're gonna be great together (Oh no!)
We're gonna be great together (Oh no!)
We're gonna be beautiful together, we're gonna be beautiful together
We're gonna be beautiful together
Let me show you what I can do, let me show you what I can do
Let me show you what I can do, let me show youâ€”
Let me show you how fast I get to your heart.."

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Oh shit! Here we go again!
When you met her she was right, so thick
Somethin' better than a wife, no glitch
She wants forever, but she might go click
If you leave her you'll see a (Psycho bitch!)
Now she's calling your crib at night, so sick
Wanna pop up and tryin' ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbit told her to slice your dick
If you ever break up with a (Psycho bitch!)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Don't gimme that shit but a nigga don't care, never coulda be there
That I was up in the middle of a game of double dare
When I woke up I was in a motherfucking nightmare
How you gonna fuck me on Sunday
When you wanna say you love me on Monday, you bugging!
Thinkin' everybody gotta bow down 'cause you offered your loving
If you on your telephone and then she lose it when you using it
If you sleep don't leave it on nigga, for true she will go through with it
If she, call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation is not lewd, the bitch is ludicrous
Mad when you got a better bitch around
Sad 'cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never woulda got up in the woman
If I knew about the menace then I'd never wanna dick her down
If she taking Seroquel or Celexa
The bitch probably stop and then try to catch ya
Sleeping with a beauty itchin' to get ya
You better hope you never leave in a stretcher
If you with a psycho don't go through with it, be through with it
Right in the midst of happiness her mood'll switch, she'll ruin it
You think that you know women and you're just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga didn't think at the end of this, you will have to shoot a bitch

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Please, don't bring no psycho shit to me
(I love you, why don't you love me?)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho
'Cause your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)

"I want you in my life forever"

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yo! She poppin' up at the club
Lookin' for you when the roll is in
And when the push comes to shove
Here you go on the floor with this ho' again
Psycho bitches never let it go, trippin's inevitable
Be ready to get up and go (Why?)
'Cause Tecca N9na just said to the so!
Break in my crib, sniffin' my drawers
Lookin' for white bitch hair on my balls
Trippin' wit' you when you out with the family
She get it poppin' right there in the mall
Fuck with the bitch is definite, better watch who you steppin' with
Fuck attention deficit, better watch who the fuck you messin' with
Just because I fuck you, that don't mean we getting married, ho'
The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitches when it comes to relationships are very slow
Bitch'll never understand it's over 'til you buried low
No, don't be up in the MySpace flippin' out
Trippin' with strippers you think I'm diggin' out
Me saying that I'll never be taken by the hands of another man is a bad omen
'Cause you never know, it might just be the hands of a woman, psycho bitch

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Please, don't bring no psycho shit to me
(I love you, why don't you love me?)
Never ever go down low with a (Psycho bitch!)
Better never ever go out with a (Psycho bitch!)
Everybody better learn how to see a (Psycho bitch!)
Never know when your girl might be a psycho
'Cause your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)
Your bitch is psycho too, psycho too
Kill her with a milla, put a knife in you, twice in you (Psycho bitches, psycho bitches)

"[?] my tongue, "

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Stop callin' me, never really wanna hear no heartfelt shit
You ain't healthy for me and bitch I'm on a health kick
Psycho bitches are self-destructive, weak and helpless
I'm done with you, bitch, now you can let somebody else hit

[Verse 3: Liquid Assassin]
She so sick with it, I stick hit it, and dick fitted
Never did I think for a minute to quick quit it
Chick is only living and driven to get hitted
Turn around and flip and get you in deep shitted
But she wasn't better to get you indebted
You can make paper and money of men sinning
You can run a bitch by adjustin' her antennas
But if she's demented you better forget it
She's psycho like Michael, you might go wake up to knifes and rifles
When your eyes low she's liable like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly ho like rivals be and turn you in to 5-0
Either that you turn your back and the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
She'll illicit them phone calls, don't stop with them harassing threats
When the vision was them drawers and me plottin' on havin' sex
Got me trippin', fist in a ball, somethin' gon' happen next
I'ma kill this crazy bitch, and give her back to Tech!
