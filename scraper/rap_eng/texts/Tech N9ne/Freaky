[Intro]
F-R-E-A-K
This is for my tail clappers
Mail stackers, ass shakers
Cash makers, who blast Vegas
Yo, this is for the freaks baby
Petite ladies, even my cellulite ladies
This is Tech N9ne baby!

[Verse 1]
When I was 5 years old, my uncle snuck me into a drive in show
Got in without pay I hid between Jimmy and Big Bro
A triple-X flick didn't even know what I was in fo' (Yo)
I seen some things that made me feel kinda funny inside
I seen some things, that my momma wouldn't want me to see at this size
I seen some stuff, homeboys in the back was huffin' and puffin'
Windows foggy, didn't know when I came of age I'd be glutton fo' muffins
Homeboy when I seen this, I really mean this (I was really shocked)
And my teammate was really fiendish (It got really hot)
Feelin' blank and little squeamish (but I didn't want it to stop)
My uncle said "Dontez, don't piss your pants"
Everybody laughed then proceeded to watch
Went back to school, yo, the next day
Didn't look at homegirls the same way
Started askin' neighbors can their girls come out to play
Instead of hide and go seek, it's hide and go get it with no delay

[Hook]
I grew this thing called freaky all sex
In my brain it was the best thang
I caught it when I was young and ornery
Just a baby havin' nasty dreams
I heard it was a zodiac thing they say (SCORPIOS)
Are known to be freaks
I see somethin' lookin' good I say "Dwamn!"
And when I see that ass hop I get gee (get gee)

[Verse 2]
Time kept on movin' and my shell is closed fly
Lookin at young girlies sayin' there tail is swole
I'm already sittin' and hopin' that hell is cold
N9ne lost his virginity when he was 12 years old
To a girl named Marlene, me and her were starving
Fo' each other, under the covers cooped up like sardines
My hard thing started barging
Thought it was retarded, when it spit on her, we started to arguing
Here's a lesson to the young folks, don't try this at home
Don't start it early like Tech N9ne, wait 'til you are grown
When I was in high school I would wake up
In the morning after I'd take a shower
I'd put on a non-lubricated condom, cause it could be on at any hour
In my brain it's like a disease (Disease)
I see a fine girl walkin' by I'm on her like freeze (Freeze, freeze)
I ain't gotta let her know I write hits or I got cheese
All she gotta do is look into my eyes
Get her hypnotized and watch her open them L.E.G.s

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Nowadays I'm off up in adult clubs I cannot shake it
Pretty women I wanna give 'em mo' love, I cannot fake it
Freaky vibe bitches got me up in Lustland, that's where you bring us
Got me lovin' really big butts and that cunnilingus
I still be watchin' pornos, eatin' Digornos
My hormones been runnin' wild since the day that I was born-o
Tossed you, won't get off you, in the kitchen I'mma post you
On the sink we breakin' dishes Micheal Douglas and Glenn Close ya
Do you really wanna get up in a bed wit a psycho sex fiend
If you never wanna do it in the flesh we can do it in a wet dream
I'mma get up in your brain on pain, it will be me and you (Cha-cha)
In a minute before I get in it, I'll tell you boo what I really wanna do
I wanna

[Backwards]
Throw you on the bed, rip all your clothes off quick
Six nine fellatio while the wolfman licks
Make it till ya get one, then with a devil's eye
We fuck and it feels so good that it makes you wanna cry
Freaky
