[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
What you're about to witness
Is one of the best collaborations of all time
Kansas City's, Humboldt County's
Show 'em we are what we are

[Verse 1: Underrated]
Hey yo, when I rap no never know buddy can do better
A mouth full of cheddar make me a greedy setter
Got a mean vendetta, my team is too clever
Never ever gonna stop, cause I rock fo'ever
You ain't never gonna see me when I be me
When it comes to the rhymes, can't beat me
All the girls say, "you complete me"
Even some weekly wanna meet me
Bust on the scene like Jeezy (Yeeeaah)
Now everybody want a Potluck CD
After the show, collect the dough
Then we go to the hotel blowin' smoke
Get and hold the Po because my flow is dope
Because I'm invincible, you can't sink the boat
Fuck American Idol, we rock hardcore bitch
Get stupid, get dumb, matter fact let's thizz
Underrated and  about my biz
Put the pump in the back of the Benz
Quick better tell all your friends
It's Potluck and Tech N9ne rockin' again
And we rockin' MO with Krizz Kaliko
His flow is so cold, gotta go gold
And a lock in the do' like a fo-fo
At a show, man I'm never so-so
Iâ€™m the syllable criminal unforgettable let it go
In the stereo share a bowl gettin high
Motherfuckers staring but pity for 'em baring
But when they lyric go and if you wanna bet 'em they gon die
Now we gotta roll the riches (No lie)
Hanging up the colder pictures (Don't cry)
I gotta stand in the street with my hand on my dick
Cause I wanna be sayin' "I'm rich bitch"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
When I party with ya'll
We drinkin' Crown up at the bar
When I'm smokin' with ya'll
Take it to the head 'til we fall
And we duckin' the law
We hit them corners 'til they gone
See 'em fuckin' with ya'll
Cause we are what we are
(2x)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Anybody got another pill I gotta get a motherfucker
To give me the artificial loving, I wanna be trippin'
I gotta be high, tryin' to kick it hella wicked until we die
Never the nigga to get a milli when I'm tripin' and buckin' it
I'm a nigga in the party with your bitch and I'm fuckin' it
But you gotta be ready to get up and go
If you wanna start up a fight over ragidy hoes
Me and Potluck put the cocks up in a hot slut
Tryin' to bust a nut before the slot locks up
Given a minute to get us up in it bet everybody shiver
When I deliver the jock pops up
Underrated he made it a bomb with the heat
Makin' it so it ain't never calm in the street
Tecca Nina with One Ton nigga we come from nothin'
We bustin' like hella spawns on a buh-buh-buh-buh-beat
Verbally ya heard of me murder thee mental capacity
Flippin' with Missouri in back of me, pack a B
Thinkin' imagine me Tech attack a motherfucker with the tongue (DAAMN!)
Nigga ya better be steadily bringin' the medily
Readily, cause ev-ery niggas thinkin' ahead of me
Will never be fetty cause I bring it like a bullet from a gun
So what you really wanna do?
Get back on the road, get a sack, crack a brew
Put a bitch in the back and I give her what she really
Wanna motherfucker to makin' it do what it do
With a Caribou Lou, 151, Malibu Rum and pineapple juice
You know the party gotta be fun, compatible groups'a niggas
Chillin' with ya home girl in 707 with the liquor

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3: One Ton]
Hey, bartender can I get another round
With a little bit of ice and a lot more Crown
Keep it strong with the clowns when I'm in your town
Bet it all goes down cause I got that sound
Say what I wanna when I jump up on your rhythm
When I smoke better try Humboldt (Humboldt)
Take a hit 'til you cry and choke
Now know why I rhyme so dope
Party all day and night with a ho
Gonna get that dough like I just passed go
And the next show better be the best yo
Kick it at the hotel, I just get so frisco
All the way to Esko, flow mad chick and I say presto
Let a nigga get a little sip of XO
I pull the rest and tell the bitch lets go (C'mon)
I do what I do, rap what I be
Flow straight heat, gettin' high in the street
Got what I need grow a mouth full of seed
You can take it from we at the top of the peak
Do what I can for the fan, I am what I am, I'm another weed man
Green like a vegan, not a mean man
I don't got a green thumb, I got a whole green hand

[Hook] (2X)
