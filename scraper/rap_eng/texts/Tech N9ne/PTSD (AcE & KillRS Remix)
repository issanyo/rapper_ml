[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: AcE & KillRS]
I ask for bones I start kicking the can
Trust me ima flash in the pan
Have trouble sleepin with my
Insane re-a-lity
 my cut-throat-blood-dreams
Seeps through my pillow-seems
Keeps turning me to the dark dimension
I don't understand these hallucinations
No more patience going down the road to hatred
I'm losin it
Give my soother to satan
Ain’t gotta say anything again
I need to be good, god plz give me a life span
Panic when i spit bars with the organic rap flow
Like an erratic asshole
Slowly increasing my status with some static
I need to be loose and leave bullies afraid
Entering the game, nothin to say
Suffering pain from this renegade
Slowly becoming Insane
Of course It’s a curse of
Being lyrical
Where every word is critical
Critics know We split you in two
When we flow and spit
All we gotta do is flick
To wreck the floor boards
Endure the horrorcore
Before it hits
It’s flipping you off to a pit
I’m sick
Quick
When i make the smallest mis-ta-kes
Kinda need the risk take
Can't help but to blame myself
Silent as I compel the mess up
No chest up, AcE just fess up
Ignore the sudden RIP!
Slipping of, I'm losing the GRIP!
As it SPLITS!
Now what? SHIT!
