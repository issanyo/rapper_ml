[Intro: Tech N9ne]
The time has come
You can go now
I think they've had enough

[Bridge: Suli4Q]
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
I don't know what to say to you, damn
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
Ain't nobody changed but you

[Chorus: Suli4Q]
No you can't stand it, stand it
Been all over the planet, planet
All around the planet, planet
All over the planet, planet
(look what you done made me do)
All around the planet

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Nina nigga, Pyune ground zero
They don't question the best and the illest clown we know
That's taking 'em down below
When they faking with a town hero
They facing total devastation when they flaking
With a hound be though
They crowned me so I'm bound to sound egotistical
Get your ho with the flow, this is no gal she wrote
They pounce emo with the people in brown V coats
So chico you found lethal renowned profound negros
I'm really fed up with people
Really wanna go head up with evil
Anybody wanna dead us to fecal
Never gonna be read up in diesel
Nigga with the OGs
But it don't mean that I won't throw B's still
Put a nigga down more cheese will
And I got a bit so please chill
On that hoe shit, saying I lost my flow spit
When I come so ferocious, such a level of dopeness
But silly folks is saying hip hop is hopeless
But use rappers as host-ess, sweetest lyrics is ghostwrit
Hypnosis, is what they gotta be under
It's like they all in a slumber to lift throat dick
That ain't no bloke shit, rappers need to revoke this
Feminine hocus pocus if you ain't really a broke wrist
So many years making millions, you live to become the villain
For real I'm ready and willing to reach a billion
Right through the ceiling, I left your planet of illing and killing
My planet's chilling your's gave me a funny feeling
Fuck y'all

[Bridge: Suli4Q]
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
I don't know what to say to you, damn
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
Ain't nobody changed but you

[Chorus: Suli4Q]
No you can't stand it, stand it
Been all over the planet, planet
All around the planet, planet
All over the planet, planet
(look what you done made me do)
All around the planet

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
People gonna hear me though
I don't come with no semi flow
I go fully and then deebo like a bully off Henny bro
I kill any and thinny skinnies tryna pin me and many mo
Then he blow then give me dough then envy wanna unfriend me so
I left you hate on N9na so F you
Ain't no rapper a threat to us plus nothin' Tech do (no)
So hear the vet spew comin' from the midwest zoo
How you gonna come and test who
Got the power to bless you
Fuck these little puppies, I'm husky
When I eat they food I'm making 'em puss bleed
I must feed, fanging 'em I had enough greed to help me succeed
I was raised a rough breed that was taught to crush fleas
When they irritate me I don't even wanna hear it lately
Nigga trippin' over here is crazy
And the reason is queer Spacey
So hear it baby never be a day that I fear a lady actions
Weird shady captions, dropping tears maybe
Some will listen to this and hate on it
Me be sloppy you motherfuckers continue to wait on it
Been ahead of my time
You constantly late on shit
Underestimatin' Tecca N9na the great on this
I left four years ago (bitch)
Did enough music for four years ya know
So from now when that four years is up
And you lookin' for N9na's stuff
It'll be gone 'cause I've had enough
Of me proving to you I can buss
Fuck this shit!

[Bridge: Suli4Q]
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
I don't know what to say to you, damn
Look what you done made me do
Look what you done made me do
Look at you, man, look at you
Why your feelings on your face
Ain't nobody changed but you

[Chorus: Suli4Q]
No you can't stand it, stand it
Been all over the planet, planet
All around the planet, planet
All over the planet, planet
(look what you done made me do)
All around the planet
