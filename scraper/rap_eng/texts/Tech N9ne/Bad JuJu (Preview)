Tech N9ne - Planet (2018)

[Tech N9ne]
This is tribal
Stick his rival, in the mouth with a right blow
Then he get this pyro
Young punk better lie low somewhere pro'ly up in Cairo
With a Bible when a psycho
Wanna give a hit a light pole
When the knife go with the quickness
You so full of bitchness
You trip flipping on chicks but a b-boy make him wanna shit bricks
This is vicious, everything out yo lips is ficticous, hehe
Misses made me mad as Mozzy, huh
Man the motive must've been made of molly, huh
Milla maximize a mess, man, I'm mind of Malcolm X
And a martyr man whose mom is Maude
Better be cool, I'ma lead you to the B fools that'll greet you
With a blacca, blacca, blacca, leave you
In a coffin, often talkin' fecal
