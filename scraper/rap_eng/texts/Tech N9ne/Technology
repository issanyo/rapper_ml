[Hook: JL]
If the boogieman won't let you sleep (Let you sleep)
Count your blessings, now you're counting sheep (Countin' sheep)
You clear your head and find a spot for me (Spot for me)
I climb in your bed through my technology (Technology)

[Verse 1: JL]
You're laying lonely, I'm on the other side of the planet
You get to show me because of technological advancement
Luckily this ain't a dead zone, textin' messages on red roam
Come directin' in the headphones, sextin' like I'm in the bedroom
We relyin' on reception, the satellite to keep a visual (Visual)
Only good is my connection, tonight the love I get is digital (Digital)
F-f-face time on the iOS, fit of entertainment for insomnia
K-k-kiss your pixelated thigh and breast
Got me fiending flesh like a zombie love
Finger rubbin' on the speaker when you speakin'
Maybe we can go to sleep like that
Hoping we can keep the frequency
And you can frequently release the freak like that
It's the life I lead and my availability is different every week like that
Situation isn't gravy all the time, I know it take a lot to be my bitch
Eyes on a mission, nights like I'm turning my device
Put on my WiFi and I'm slippin'
Bright when it's dipped in
Fly to the cellphone screen
Bring what's on your mind to fruition
High definition, pull you-pull you into my virtual reality
You wanna be bad with me, charge your battery

If the boogieman won't let you sleep (Let you sleep)

[Post-hook: JL]
When you in the mood for love
Give you my computer love (Computer Love)
All you do is tune in
I'm watching what you doing
It's like I'm in the room with ya

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Turn me on I'm feeling freaky (freaky)
Come connect I'm the Wee-fee (Wee-fee)
Power surge going deeply
Inside of you doing get it then repeat me (CHA!)
Cause it don't take nothing for me to reboot
Simultaneously we skeet and we hoot
Hard to hear us when that shroud's bumpin'
Have you shaking like a malfunction, DM is poppin'
Your fingers be offing your box and you talking to me (Aye)
Wish I could hop on the screen
And be plop in between and me rocking your G (Aye)
Samsung LTE (Aye)
Don't you get weaker on me (Aye)
Cause I need this video to load immediately gotta view it properly (Aye)
This is why I got the big screen
Straight colossal for the spit scene
Baby you're sending me so many
I think I finally send you a dick meme saying
"Hi my name is Hound and if you wanna ride then you gotta hop on"
So much skin inside of my phone, that I had to label it the hot zone
Love connection, your bud reflection
Inside of my telephone I got a chub erection
I wish I could really come and get a hug caressin'
Your beautiful body
Now you made of blood your best friend
Tecca Nina I'm the prodigy
Gotta be having sexual in-fallacy
Ought a she's God this sex ought a be
Steve Jobs thank you for your technology
