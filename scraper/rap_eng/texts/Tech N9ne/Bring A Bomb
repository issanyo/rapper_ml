[Chorus]
If you're gonna fuck with me you better bring a bomb, bring a bomb
Cause you know it's going down
If you're gonna fuck with me you better bring a bomb, bring a bomb
Cause you know that's on

[Bridge: Campo]
If you plan to fuck with Campo I think you will need a bomb
I wanna cause Vietnam
If you think that you can fuck with me well you're dead wrong
I'ma take you all out each one by one
Who are you

[Verse 1: Campo]
Haters really ain't shit to me I put their face on Unsolved Mystery
You're history, consider this my victory
I will kill the flows of those who pose and come inconsistently
I kill this beat so viciously
These A&R's keep missing me
Call myself an artist cause I paint a picture vividly
You'd think I worked at UPS I mastered my delivery
If you think that you can end my reign I will kill you physically
Mentally a'cappella or instrumentally
And when I tell you "Bring A Bomb"
Take my words literally
And if you don't finish me
I will make you feel my misery
And I'm so cold
Now the whole world's frigidy
You'll need a new nuclear device
Just to diminish me
Uh
To diminish me
I got these AK's AR red beams
PS Star is the team
Campo kill his dream

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Napalm!
Hittin' this bitch blowin' it to bits everybody stay calm
Yeah that's Aaron
Eating this piece like Kreayshawn
I mean bacon
Welcome to the rock nation
They come hooded up like Trayvon
Better bring a bomb
Never would that really happen they softer than Avon
Stupid shit the beat stay blonde
And I will write this hit in red crayon
Cause I'm way bonged and like Rae Dawn Chong's daddy
And all of them record haters
They done gone batty
Tried to blow my spot up but they had Aaron's wrong addy
They don't wanna fuck with the Black Rambo
Yeah I'm country like a Banjo
Who the rock hoes dance for?
Tecca Nina and Campo
Now we ain't about to romance yo
Get luchini like gamblou
Doing music getting money and knocking hoes down it's what we stand for
Got the industry to put my ding-a-ling upon
Diamonds between me and Campo
It's a bling a thon
Bitches sing along
Put your fingers on whats between your thong
Demons - they trying to get me
They better bring a bomb!

[Chorus x2]
