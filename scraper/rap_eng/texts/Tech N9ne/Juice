Give me, give me, give me the juice
Give me, give me, give me, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Ubiquitous]
Another day in the life, no time for play, I'm tryin' to cake
High stakes, survival increasing my fire rate
Eyes dilated, aim my sight, fly straight
If I ever want my record to see the light of day
I'mma find a way, weight of the world, need a lift
If he carry bags I know he gon' need a tip
You're free to give my man, but I don't need a disk
With a grip of tracks, it's really nothing for me to skip
We the creed of a better breed and you'll never read us
Since you never see us and that's, if and you ever see us
My nemesis, while you're bein' an Ebenezer
I’ll be seein' sights, sipping on something with señoritas
Pro-political peace, let them breathe
Whether Palestinian, Israeli or Lebanese
Behold the horse I'm pale as I'll ever be
Trying to catch sun while I'm sailing the seven seas
I float my friends, scuttle my enemies
And we constantly in the struggle for energy
I rock steadily in the spot, ready or not
Pushin' my pronouns for plenty penny a pop - Ha!
I'm getting guap my man I got plans
To cop land away and lay in the hot sand
I know the ledge and I'm playin' my Roxanne
Another dollar another day in a rock band
That's juice!

[Hook]
Give me, give me, give me the juice

[Verse 2: Godemis]
Crawling out of a casket, awoke from madness
I've been in the middy and feeding off the sadness
If any an enemy come in rattling as if
He ready for Armageddon, I wet them and that's it
I've been in the back bitch, playing the sidekick
Surprised they realize the size of my dick
They blog and criticize the lines of my shit
Straddle a boner, I ain't a loner, you ride dick
Better get them a stretcher and oxygen mask
Socks and gym bags, box of Slim Fast
I lose dead weight, got a lot to get past
For all that hate, I'm about to get cash
I ain't got a chain yet, you're hearing the same vet
Could say that I'm lucky I made it out of a train wreck
Want me to speed it up motherfucker? It ain't Tech
It's Godemis, idiot, study up on on the name check
I zone in the canvas, I'm in the paint, they ain't ready
I spray Seven and ate them alive, the aim's steady
It's like me and Jason using the same 'chete
So 'Raw' I'm 'Delirious' nigga it ain't Eddie
It don't matter I don't chatter at all at y'all
The new data is out of an old catalog
The instinct is that of an old, rabid dog
Who might have been good on that day, when he had it all
That's juice

[Hook]
Give me, give me, give me the juice

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Wakin' 'em up, shakin' the fuck
Out of Pagans that are matin', fornicatin' with hate and sick lust
Eating bloody steak and bacon with Satan
They can abruptly be taken by Yates
And I'm placin' this blade in his guts
Invasion of us slegna, raisin' a cup, here's to
Layin' the blade to they who bathin' in blood Bedla
Might behead ya, psyches dead for life, he bled
But Iké said to knife these Negras!
Bright been away for the night, I'm a sinner
Hey my inner light went astray, see the fright
I generate, I innovate in a fight I'mma incinerate
A mic, men obey, when I write they disintegrate
It's over, soul of a soldier
Chose to be cold and overload you with vulgar
S'posed to be old but the flows getting bolder
And hoes lose they clothes never holding they composure
That's juice... bitch

[Hook]
Give me, give me, give me the juice
