[Hook: Smith A.D]

[Verse 1: Smith A.D]
Anybody know what it takes to be like me?
What it takes to see like we?
What it takes to be down?
Them pioneers from 3P
See, I got John Body from the CEO
My backbone [?]
T-Rough [?]
I spit fast from the dirt to the top yo
Do you know what it takes to be a pioneer?
I don't know if you don't know won't know who
What it takes to be a pioneer? (Check it out)
Trendsetter, money maker, hardcore, go getter
Can I get a pump pump for y'all?
Smith A.D [?] for the foe warm up for y'all
Smith [?] on the map for y'all
Pioneers blow it up and coming back for y'all
Don't stop 3P set it up for y'all
Throw it up, throw it up if you feel the job
Roll it up real tight with the top man
Crack back and cristal in the meanwhile and shout pioneer
