Just because I was inspired by The Doors to name my label Strange Music never meant that it would be written in blood that I would be able to work with The Doors. You know what I'm saying but I was blessed enough to be called to Paris to do a show and while I was there, I was able to go to PÃ¨re Lachaise and tell Jim thank you for the inspiration and later on, I ended up working with his homies. I kicked it. You know what I'm saying thanks to FredWreck and when I was talking to Ray Manzarek you know what I mean in the studio and he was putting on his coat and I was like:
"Where are you going?"
And he was like,"I'm gonna go find some wine"
"Oh, like Pinot Noir?"
And he said, "Yeah, how did you know?"
I said, "I don't know, that's what I drink"
So we drank Pinot Noir together, you know what I'm sizzlin'? And had some laughs, and I asked him some questions and my homeboy passed

I just wanna say rest in piece, Raymond Daniel Manzarek Jr
Much love
