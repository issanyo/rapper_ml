[Intro]
Are you seeing what I'm seeing on the TV, man?
I mean, look at 'em
They say they rappers but they don't dress like rappers
I mean we wore like 501s and Chuck Taylors and Cortez's
You know, white tee shirts and Dickies, know what I mean?
Skin tight jeans like my little girl homie
Cognito, uh, be legit mane
I mean, I don't know about y'all, but I'm really missin'...

[Chorus]
Hip Hop and the way it was
Nowadays this game wasn't made for us
Out with the old in with the new and away we go
You can hear it through the videos and radio
I ain't tryna downplay it that's the way it is
Nowadays this game it was made for kids
I ain't pointin' no fingers, I ain't sayin' names
But raise your hand if you agree hip hop needs a change
(Stop, stop, stop, stop)

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
I date back, way back, daddy brown Cadillac
Sixes in the back, still rock the 8-track
Then came the rap like Rapper's Delight
Big Hank, word to Mike, Master G type hype
I got it in when Run and them was the kings of rock
Same donkey, same Adidas I was king of the block
Ain't it funky kept it hot before the rock got shot
Then Chris got hot but then miss that hip hop
The west kept it gangsta, NWA
Too Short kept it pimpin' for the whole damn Yay
Tales from the triple beam, somethin to say
It was all real [?] ill back in the day
But now when they speak it just ain't the same
They talk about the chains and how they makin' it rain
They talk about the 'caine and don't see no bricks
So it's hard for me to really understand this shit

[Chorus]


[Verse 2: Cognito]
When I was young I would've killed for a pair of shell-toe Adidas
Mom asked me why I wear them shoes, cuz Run DMC is
That's what I loved about it
Hip hop was a state of mind, a different time, a different grind
A tape runs out you hit rewind
I spent more time at the record shop then in school
Thought I was cool, the first shoes that I bought were like LL Cool
I never knew that hip hop would grow to be such a passion
Not one day would pass that I was writing music in class
In a flash I was rappin' myself
If only everyone could feel the relief that I do through music
And learn to use it seems like nowadays half these cats abuse it
What ever happened to freestylin' on the block and in the park
And flippin' sixteen bars back and forth 'til it was dark
Gotta be honest I miss it
Nowadays these young motherfuckers have got it twisted
They spit shit but they ain't gifted
Originality just drove by homie, you must've missed it
I'm here to take this shit back in an instant, I'm that persistent
I miss...

[Chorus]


[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
I said how about some realness
You bustas got an illness
Hella whack but still rich
One hit then came up real quick
Ya prolly sucked the dealsnick
Of a label rep to build it
Favors for your meal tick
And I'm 'bout to pull the killswitch
Listen to me its over
My dick you say I'm a soldier
All of you niggas are posers
The skinny jeans are bogus
Lookin' like some hoes
Must be dissin off of your dozer
I be rockin' shows, yuh
Just like I'm practicin' yoga

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hip Hops in my blood and I still rep it
I kill records in a mill-second
I will wreck it throw up then Bill stepped it
But nowadays some of these niggas I won't validate
Cuz they salivated when cowards rallyin' for the style of gay
I'm old school but new
But I told you the truth
When I said I flowed you and I made your hoes do the do
And they rolled through the crew
Told you toodooloo
Real hip hoppers say "get out the way bitch" like Luda do

[Chorus]
