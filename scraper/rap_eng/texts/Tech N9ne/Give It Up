[Intro: Tech N9ne]
It's for real emcees only, nigga
Everybody on this mothafuckin' flow
This real shit right here
Lebowski hit 'em!

[Verse 1: Lebowski]
Gotta give it up 'cause it is a must plus
I'm fast like a rushed bus
On her ass we bust nuts
Then we smash past your city
Never last, the big bucks
I'ma gas this pair up
Whoop ass and kick dust
They try to talk tall but their money is straight dwarf
And you won't think it's funny when we pull up in the grey Porsche
We treat 'em like stray whores
We leavin' their face sore
Got the gun in the safe
Shoot from the waist and the case fall
Keep on testin' me especially when my ass be up on it
It'll be a death, defeat, don't mess with me
Killing off all opponents
Never slipping, never tripping off money, matterless moments
Will you take it or you'll leave it
If you'll leave it you don't want it
I'm a strange individual
Leaving you suckers to drown
The flow's continuous, when I begin to it
Chopping your bitch, it goes up for the pound
I cover the turf of the pelagic sound
I'ma diminish 'em off to the ground
We never knew gimmick, you know that we clowns
They all get with it when they hear the sound

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Whoop! So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)
So shivery they be like "doggone it" (doggone it)
So quivery they freeze at that moment
No liberty for lil bitty pretenders that want it, guess what
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down

[Verse 2: Godemis]
This here'll put the desire in 'em
Light 'em up and put a fire in 'em
Don't nobody wanna openly worship the Devil
But know that I'm writing with him
Look at the way that I ride the rhythm
I put the virus inside the venom
I don't wanna call 'em pussy but I know what they eating
I see the vagina in 'em
I admit I'm off of my rocker with underlings
You've been warned! Call Ces (creamed corn)
We running things
You fly? Fucker be gone
It's not flapping a hundred wings
I'll snatch the mermaid from out bloody water and gut her clean
When I say I got it together
They say I'm insane - funny!
The city is no utopia, notice it ain't sunny
Like Philly, really get silly, they spaz and they brains runny
'Cause everybody keeps asking what's up with the strange money
I tell 'em it's nothing to it
And choreograph the murder
Tell Fyre to play the track
And ask Ubi to bag the burger
We eating, look at 'em sleeping
Now doobie sucker you supper
I tell 'em "welcome to Kansas City, duck motherfucker!"

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)
So shivery they be like "doggone it" (doggone it)
So quivery they freeze at that moment
No liberty for lil bitty pretenders that want it, guess what
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
Stranger things have happened
Tech told 'em and now the channel in tune
Picked from the street and hit the beat, now the planet in doom
My cannon boom, if you can believe they put a man on the moon
Mission complete my landings aloe and lanolin smooth
Listen to me, oh there's so many other fish in the sea
From clown to shark so which fish are you fixing to be?
Drown in the dark or bathe in the light in the blistering heat
Of a thousand suns son 'cause it's all 7's and 6's to me
Felicity, the U-B-I be so promiscuous with
The gift that he been blessed with, Ces clips that he spit
With a stench of tree peace to McGillicuddy's lit
Up in penitentiary
Ces essentially, quintessentially crescendoing, I settle beef
Killa City could never Gepetto me
And you better believe that I'm changing in red and the green and you're never ahead of me
Man I'm a better when up in the mezzanine
In a settlement over the evergreen
And my medicine it is acetylene, huffing this oxygen
When I set it free, putting my enemies down on [?]
And we ne'er gon' let ya
Live it down again, I'm gonna get ya
Nobody wanna Erica, they wanna Ke$ha
'Cause in America everybody is messed up
I came to raise the Midwest up
And do things with Strange and big Tecca
This'll be the first time the Ces heard
Pressure, give me that yessir!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Whoop! So jittery they think I'm back on it (back on it)
So shivery they be like "doggone it" (doggone it)
So quivery they freeze at that moment
No liberty for lil bitty pretenders that want it, guess what
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
You see me get money, honeys
Everything I want I really feel it
When a dude see cleavage funny
Dummy if you never heard of me - Tecca N9na's a beauty
Peep it
A lot of groupies need it
And you a chump if you don't like it
And give it up backwards say pu ti evig
You got a pootie, I leave it so juicy when I beat it
Feed it mooley and I eat it like sushi
Betta heat it, [?]
Making 'em crazy crazy
Never much to sway these ladies
If you talk about me to a bitch and she don't suck a dick
She gon' say she pay me
Wundersch√∂n, Tech is second to none
Inadequate bums you come
But you niggas under crumbs
Dust specks
And you trippin' 'cause you know deep inside your fluffed ex fucked Tech
Paid Lebowski
Then wanted permission to suck Ces
Better give it up, check it, I'm bout' to rip it up
Tech impeccable, never no better flow
When I flip a cut everybody so nigga what evolution is big enough
To get you hickin' up when your bitch'll be licking dick and nut
Death'll be the only way you're cold
So sorry I had to give away your soul
Tecca N9na never ever give it up
For the crown better try him later hoes

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
Give it up 'cause I never let you down
