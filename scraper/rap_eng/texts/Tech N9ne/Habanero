[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Your journey from Earth to Planet Pyune has been successful
When exiting this aircraft, a Speedom-mobile will be assigned to you
Ah

[Pre-Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Let me hear you talking, I'm so far away
Let me hear a single word that you say
Feel like y'all just mad at my dinero
All I gotta say, "You think you hot, lit, bitch I'm habanero"

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Nothing identical
Bussin' I mimic no fuckin' bug, I'm crushin' thy tentacles
Suckas be huffin' and puffin' 'cause I'm touchin' my pinnacle
Cussin' my menace flow, now their women are suckin' my genitals
They flip 'cause so many is the heat
I got the remedy all of my enemies feel ignominious defeat
Knowin' it finna be like an infinite lettin' 'em have it
I wreck and I ravage, a Tech and a Travis make the record a savage
I popped a muffin, I skywalk for nothin'
But takin' you higher levels when I rock percussion
I'm at the top of the list in a fly chop discussion
It's fried hot on my block and I'm not the Cuzzin
The eye lock is sudden
Whenever the people see me they cry lots of lovin'
We high notch the oven
And my clock's-a-buzzin' when you're done and you die, drop fo' dozen (Roses!)

[Pre-Chorus: Tech N9ne & Mackenzie Nicole]
Can't get too close 'cause I'm real
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
My temperature make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Keep it lit up and I'm still
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
I got no brakes and no chill
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Let me hear you talking, I'm so far away
Let me hear a single word that you say
Feel like y'all just mad at my dinero
All I gotta say, "You think you hot, lit, bitch I'm habanero"

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
LAJFA the wealthy and not the poors that've got not
So I'm bringing the heat and I'm walkin' on agua
'Cause if I'm a penny pusher that be like blah-blah
And never listen to see if you habanero
So I'm stuck in the booth and I'm Colin Farrell
I'm sweatin' with every second I'm destined like I'm an arrow
Aimin' right at your chest if you effin' with my dinero
Get out! Nobody touchin' the Tecca Nina
If you feeling you can do better, then you a dreamer
I'm gonna live and givin' critics the middle finger
Bringing hella disaster, ain't nobody no FEMA
Welcome to my planet, we damage and we can chop
Killers with the advantage, we manage to be the top
Competitors ain't no better 'cause we the head of the flock
We made the Planet Rock, now I'm gonna make your credit drop
And it stops...

[Pre-Chorus: Tech N9ne & Mackenzie Nicole]
Can't get too close 'cause I'm real
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
My temperature make you feel
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
Keep it lit up and I'm still
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
I got no brakes and no chill
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

[Chorus: Mackenzie Nicole]
Let me hear you talking, I'm so far away
Let me hear a single word that you say
Feel like y'all just mad at my dinero
All I gotta say, "You think you hot, lit, bitch I'm habanero"
