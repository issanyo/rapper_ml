[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
Enter in my castle and you'll bow down
You'll hear the sounds
Feel my fortress rumble as the walls
Come crashing down
Let my words possess you and your mind
Your mind, your mind
If there is a God, look up and you'll find
You will find

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
(Praise KOD)
LAJFA! Last words spoken by my mom
Heaven opened on June 6th, mama's on the first thing smoking
So many emotions
Sipping on my potion, choking, black slime's taken over my body
So much it will contaminate the ocean (I'm not joking)
Get 'em up, wanna bust, with enough of anguish
I'ma clutch and he trust when he touch, my name is so famous
I'm adjusting a bunch of stuff, my brain it grows heinous
And I'm loving that rough and tough and tainted, so dangerous
People piling in to peep it
So many step inside to see the secrets
Really I'm a rabble-rousing reverend
Writing in reefer, risen, rippin' a wretched rhyme, release it
Blood in my mucus, turn it into mud I should've gutted the lupus
That bug is intrusive, what the government uses
To turn love into nuisance, and shoving a big drug in your juices
Wondering if I'ma bust and light this llama up
If I'm the number synonymous with anonymous
The drama just equal Osama nuts
You crazy, that's why they honor us, listen to it
I am not professin' to be the highest in heaven
So I say with no discretion, this is a K-O-D session
So if any wanna question, you pro'lly should get to steppin'
'Cause you 'bout to hear the lesson of twenty minus eleven

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
Enter in my castle and you'll bow down
You'll hear the sounds
Feel my fortress rumble as the walls
Come crashing down
Let my words possess you and your mind
Your mind, your mind
If there is a God, look up and you'll find
You will find

[Bridge: Ryan Bradley] (x7)
Praise KOD

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
(My word is spreading all over the world)
Parents get this for your children
Help me carry on this love that I'm buildin'
So many years I have been drillin' through ceilings
With a pack of villains, minimal killing, lord willin'
Inshallah, really just sent Allah
What a Christian just saw, evil winning
Don't know what it meant to y'all when death went to Maud'
But it really bent the KOD, please no grinning
What can I do, to make you believe
All this beautiful music I conceive
I'm taking out the pain and times the N9na grieves
And putting it to music, now you heard to leave
For your spirits I covet, that doesn't say "Devil worshipper," does it?
Good and evil, I got oodles and oodles of it
And I got so many more followers comin' and I love it
Wonder why everybody's insane when they come to Strange
They had my mother locked up in chains like she was deranged
I'm takin' aim on every lame, they're gonna see the change
Watchin' my brain darken the game

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
Enter in my castle and you'll bow down
You'll hear the sounds
Feel my fortress rumble as the walls
Come crashing down
Let my words possess you and your mind
Your mind, your mind
If there is a God, look up and you'll find
You will find

[Bridge: Ryan Bradley] (x7)
Praise KOD

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
My blood runs through this music forever living through you

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
Enter in my castle and you'll bow down
You'll hear the sounds
Feel my fortress rumble as the walls
Come crashing down
Let my words possess you and your mind
Your mind, your mind
If there is a God, look up and you'll find
You will find
(Praise KOD)
