[Intro]
HEY-EH!
Been waiting too damn long on a side
Don't know how many damn times I've tried
Ain't got too many good things to say
So here's a message to mister DJ!

[Hook]
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

[Verse 1]
Ay, treat it
Like I was coming from Billings on the way to Spokane
And you found me twisted and mangled inside our road van
Like it's so ugly the paramedics say "Oh, man!"
There go Tecca Nina with no life but more fans
Like in hell or I'm in heaven, just fell in from nine-eleven
Propelling from high and dove in the concrete
Like my name was McVeigh and I check the mail and a bomb beeped
Like having Griseldaâ€™s dope and sell it beyond cheap
Like I was in the mood for set tripping
Fights begin and Rugers get splitting
Like my life is through and death slips in
Like there's no air left and my chest stiffens
Like I'm in the church and I'm preaching
Loving the way sister look and after service we creeping
Play my music like we was in the telly deep asleep
Then got murdered 'cause her husband was the deacon

[Hook]
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

[Verse 2]
(Bring that beat back, bring that beat back)
Like having super pneumonia with out taking my z-pack
Like me off in a C function flamed up with a B hat
And I'm pattin' my pockets yellin' "Where's my piece at?"
Like an ink session getting a snake and the bat tat
Got a gun and kicked in the face and I ran to the back "Skat!"
Through the alley under a ladder tripped over a black cat
Fell in the street got hit by a Toyota with a hatchback
Play my music let everyone know that I can rhyme
But I got shipped to Iraq and I stepped on a land mine
Like a wild bull let out the cage and it's ram time
My job is to be the circus clown but I'm damn blind
Like I had the cube and I accidentally called pin head
Like I'm Matisyahu in a room full of skin heads
Play my music like I'm permanently in bed
I'm sure the DJs are with it with him dead

[Hook]
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

[Verse 3]
([?] evil aggin)
Unless I left my vest and I catch the magnum
Like they let Tech rest and toe-tagged him
After the beat him, tied him to the truck and clod dragged 'em
Like I died of lupus, cancer, leukemia
Epilepsy, m.s. or sickle-cell anemia
All at the same time and the call is a slain N9ne
Caught by a serial killer with a saw and it's pain time
Guess it really does pay to get caught with a stray
That's what it cost, what you pay in a way that's all for the say
'Cause when you rapping your ass off
Skill is their last thought
Realler than real spill but you get killed and you blast off
Play my records like I'm takin' the big ride
Like a deadly virus killing me inside
I know you sucker DJs got a lotta pride
All jokes aside even though I'm still alive

[Hook]
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried
Play my music like I died! (To the DJ)
Like the Nina ain't alive! (Quit the replay)
Like I took the long ride! (On my D-day)
Like everybody love my music
And the whole world cried

[Outro]
Play my music like I died
Like the Nina ain't alive
Like I took the long ride
Like everybody loved my music
And the whole world cried
