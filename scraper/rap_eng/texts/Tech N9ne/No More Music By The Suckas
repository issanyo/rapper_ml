[Intro]
Yeah, we garantee you !
No more music by the suckas !

[Verse 1: B.V.]
Young intelligent brotha gangsta demeanor
The game done changed dog and tell me have you seen her
I'm used to brothas gettin fluent with the pen and pad
Not niggas talkin bout what they shoulda coulda woulda had
So homie watch my flow and yea I dabble in it
I'm puttin words all together like ima scrabble winna
These suckas dead on the track yea they cadavas
Nigga abracadabra now these wack cats are no contender
These rap cats in the game sweet I call 'em splenda
I'm the realest nigga you ever know, no pretender
So if you ask me the game need a renovation
So we ain't gotta hear they wack lines on every station
Yo they be like who that is, it's B.v. the god rippin on that whoo kid shit
Ima new breed of emcee on a M-I-C on stand by the resurrected game from D-I-E
So if you answer back homie yo just think twice
Cuz fuckin with the guys like blasphemy just no christ
But if ya'll do decide to step up yo homie bring your A game
Spittin lyrical zombies rhymes eatin through they brains

[Hook]
No more music by the suckas (Yea Yea Yea)
If you want it, got it for ya (Yea Yea Yea)
No I don't wanna be the one to tell ya (tell ya)
If you ain't one of us, it's a failure (failure)
No more music by the suckas

[Verse 2: Oobergeek]
Ay good morning and good night
We lickin em up and puttin em back to sleep
Cuz they been actin like they got sleep apnea up on they beats
But it ain't their fault, sure I didn't have ain't come quick enough
And in order for hop to be hip enough is gon' take these three niggas to come and lift it up, easy
Without a damn bone without a dance song
I know you can't trust me white man but believe me
Slave ship comin I think ima hide
You can save them slave deals for them Amistads
I'm hungry like twenty nine ramadan
Ain't nothin like bein with family in a ryhme-a-thon
Lookin at the time it says mine oh nine
Which means I'm comin to invade you like Columbine
Hi, hello, didddat, exit
Couple more thidddats because the stanky leg was flexin
My words my words I know they quite vexin
But I know they more annoyin than freestylin while textin
Geez, Capiche, but before you capiche, at ease
And plant your allegiance to the double 0
You wanna get up on this track nigga double no (rookie)

[Hook]
No more music by the suckas (Yea Yea Yea)
If you want it, got it for ya (Yea Yea Yea)
No I don't wanna be the one to tell ya (tell ya)
If you ain't one of us, it's a failure (failure)
No more music by the suckas

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Motherfuck the P.D, smile at me when they see me
But they won't play my CD's even though they know it sold a milli
Really cause they greedy feeding shit on radio and T.V
See, I'm surprised there never been a kill P.D. spree
N9ne's trippin' yes I'm bitchin' when they act like I ain't rippin'
Rhyme spittin' I'm line stickin' like I designed diction
And this is my mission when I'm in they eyes
Vision Minds quicken entire ripsman of this on the grind strippin'
The crime thickens when record executives sign fiction
Align this with his and his fizzles and mind sickens
Rewind this and give it to whomeva's behind listenin'
And try an fix 'em meticulousness with this N9ne grippin'
No more music by the suckas, word from Chuck D
BDS will see me yet rotation will bust free
From media to 'mediately dissin' like fuck me
But when Weezy got with speedy Tech, the Nina's a must see
Thanks, Weezy it ain't easy to slang CD's and make a bank
When blank PD's spin it but it ain't meaty
And the DJ's they be puppets for the mothafuckas
I'm sure they had it nothin' like us, they want no more music by the suckas

[Hook]
No more music by the suckas (Yea Yea Yea)
If you want it, got it for ya (Yea Yea Yea)
No I don't wanna be the one to tell ya (tell ya)
If you ain't one of us, it's a failure (failure)
No more music by the suckas
