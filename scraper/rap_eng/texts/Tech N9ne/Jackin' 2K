[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Give me that beat Q
It's a 2K jack move
Tecca Ninna lyrical gat too
Blast the whack past it pack
When I rap backwards
??????????
If that's cool
Say hello to the Tech N9ne
The next with the best rhyme
If you test mine
Next time
That's mine
But this is how we greet ya
Crops do
We got that reefer
Puffing out the spout without a doubt
Chill up in the party without a bout
The most cloud no need to pout
It's out
We gotta shout
Biggie Smalls the illest, the realest
We love you that's what it's about
Psycho like Paris Trout when we dips out
Flips out, groupie hoes I dismount
At my shows they get a discount
The fools hate
Tech N9ne and the Rouge Dogs
Straight jackin' 2K

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Do you really want to party with these 50 hoes?
Hell motherfucking yeah
Do you really want that money from these nigga rows?
Hell motherfucking yeah
And even if you're down with my crew
I'll jack them too

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yukky Yuk numby numb whats up?
Got some yancs lined up ready to kcuf
And all faded
Ready to get related the orgy was catered
By the Midwest side team
For you claiming me regime?
Funky like my dungs on my tongue come try some
Have you ever met a nigga who was pie sprung?
And if so
Grip yo
Pistol
Get low
And ready to bust but right about now
Let's feel something from Puff
All these freestylers around me trying to Riff a Raff
Fuck where the niggas at
Where the strippers at?
All I want to say is that they don't give a damn about us
Cause they trip when us
Don't bust tips nigga
Boss dogs in the house yall
Come and party with the Ninna make the motherfucking house fall
We'll break in your crib than skate
Jacking any player hater for a break
Straight jackin' 2K

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Got a nine in my pocket and i'm ready to bust
Hella women and my records be like platinum plus
2Pac the punks duck when you struck
Much love to my outlaw niggas bringing the rup whats up?
Everybody tripping off me and my frame of mind
Wonder if i'm a psycho peeping the way we dine
Futuristical, lyrical, flippable design
Right up in my rhyme
Me Tecca N9ne
Higher the crime
Jacking niggas with hella beat in the summertime
Wait imma about i'm up in the grind
Here come a crime
In the industry
About Missouri's gonna climb
When I find imma shine in my time leaving bustas behind like that!
