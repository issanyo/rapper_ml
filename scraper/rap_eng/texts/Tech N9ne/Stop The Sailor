[Verse 1]
Stop the motion of the ocean, but that might cause some hell
Looking for the love potion we coping but I can tell
That we 'bout to hit the wave that'll grave us, another thing fails
'Cause she wanna have a baby, in the face I do not seem well
I feel I'm in the way for the brighter day to save her, save her
How can I stay when I know that she deserve it
What is my purpose?
Just a sexual service
But after I’m nervous
Never ending side
God, but I’m already a father
Before I’m lost in the agua I’m saying you got to

[Hook x2]
Stop the sailor
From sailing away from your shelter
Stop the sailor
Is that the wrong thing to tell her

[Verse 2]
You’re young and in love with an old man
But you deserve to be happy
You deserve to have what you want
What I gotta do to stop me from thinking that I should run
For her to live a better life, be the wife, living with someone
I don’t ever want to lose her but truly it got me spun
What if I am not the dude for you that nauseousness comes
Oh wow, shit, save her, save her
I get the feeling we having a crisis
And I’m feeling lifeless
Cause I want you happy
You telling me that you like this
I don’t want to leave you
But I’m a believer if a woman’s in need
She'll find someone to appease her

[Hook x3]

[Outro]
I don’t want rockers to bash me; you know what I’m sayin
I feel like ya’ll really want it to be…
This is my heart so to me I put down shit that I felt
I feel like that’s half the battle, you know
