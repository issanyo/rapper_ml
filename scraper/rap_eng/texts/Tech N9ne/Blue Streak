[Intro] (8X)
Got my back, got my back
Got my back against the wall
(Blue streak)

[Verse 1]
Untamed, I run with a game no time for the fame
I proclaim my name with a shame
It's insane my brain full of pain
Such strange in the game to maintain
My juice but I came with no shame
Hella riches I ain't the game, it's in my veins
I changed from cotton to rugging to raise stay bane
My frame, we give them samhain
Check on their change, situation crazy deranged
Anything goes my life chose was money and women
I had no intentions of gettin' froze
Blows hearts hits to the nose
Use to be like my bros but those foes
Got me behind doors case closed
Three in the row doing it to get back on my toes
Yo, this once gotta go no amateur but a pro
Lettin' you know I'm back and I'm after the dough
Devil with pedal to the floor, gotta get it

[Hook] (2X)
Drive through streets (Gotta get it)
Time to eat (Gotta get it)
Pride you're thief (Gotta get it)
Find blue streak (Gotta get it)

[Verse 2]
Can't trust, no one better bust, everybody's corrupted
For a buck, I get 'em stuck runnin' mugs, so I'mma duck
Undercover and bug anybody who touches any business I can duck
No fool for the mugs, no Chris style for the guts
No ice for the sluts plus
No souls for Satan to suck I clutch a nut
To live plus rocks and suchs
In a rug right after retrieving 'em though luck
Killer generation is my breed
Now I am involved in a high speed
Hard rock double-M Sci-Fi
If any have the halfs of the pie leaves
Thieves fraudecio p's black hearts full of greed
Who need D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S converted to cheese
Lord help me please Jeez 'em me lease
Lost 'em and never failed in the seas

[Hook] (2X)

No scratches, no stacks, no kickback
No hit in the back of the Escalade Cadillac
Straight darkness tryin' to find where my shadows at
If I found in deep in the bitch I can paddle back
Undercover blown my riches all gone
Identity prone to look up and break in your home with a chrome
Own one, everybody loves my tone gun done
No more lethal killers to run from
Thieves converted to something you won't believe
Never greave homie handed over the blue streak
With ease no more crime or law when I'm dyin'
No more swine or i'll be in solitary convine
Leave any place like the Floridan keys
With a breeze where you can do no shoes and short sleeves
But I bring my ladies and G-strings blue skies
Watching the blue streak glisten in my eyes

[Bridge]
Drive through streets
Time to eat
Pride you're thief
Find blue streak

[Hook] (2X)

[Outro]
Don Juan, blue streak
Tech N9ne, blue streak
Sway and Tech, blue streak
Midwest side, blue streak
