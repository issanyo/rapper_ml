[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Just a little ditty I wrote while flyin' high in the sky

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Somebody gotta say something, that somebody's gonna be me
People rather have separation than to come together livin' freely
All the tragedies we see on the dark streets and the TV
Make it difficult to grow a glee tree when the love level back in BC
We will never see racism done away with in our lifetime
When the parents hearts full of hate reproduce, then it's sent down the pipeline
If their kids want to fight crime, and they talk to others of the right kind
That'd be terrifying facin' nighttime and the steel is the only light shined
Jesus, not present when things seem so egregious
But if we just set aside all our differences and try to ease up
Off of war with each other, please trust, we can be just
When the hatin', killings enough and the anthem will have everybody takin' knees up

[Chorus: Jordan Omley]
No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, "No, we won't go quietly"
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yo, too many people of power afraid to say things
'Cause they don't want consumers to stop their pay streams
If they don't agree with your way of thinkin', they takin'
Your cake, cream, no love, no life is all that hate brings
I stand by love so if this don't enhance my buzz
And the fans die and my blood, the world is ran by thugs
That just want to ban my blood that runs with an angel flow
What they bleed ought to be equality, never been the angle though
But one day soon I wanna look and see the people lovin' then say,  "Bravo"
'Cause now I see a lot of killin' and fightin' like Rocky and Ivan Drago
All good to be in Cabo, I'm rollin' in your Murcielago
But we just say a prayer if you will to stop the ill drills off up in Chicago, please

[Chorus: Jordan Omley]
No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly now
No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, wishin' we could be rid of all terrorism
Like is there an 'ism' for the good? I'd say heroism
We are the dauntless in the midst of demons, we see in swarms
So mind your business unless you see somebody being harmed
I learned to love from my mother
I feel an angel around me, I know she hovers
Impatiently waitin' for you to discover
That people all need each other
When you see me, I'll call you brother
Never mattered, whatever color

[Chorus: Jordan Omley]
No, we won't go quietly
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, "No, we won't go quietly"
All the fear I've got inside will die with me
We should turn this message louder 'til the speakers bleed
But we won't go quietly
And everybody say, "No, we won't go quietly"
And everybody say, "No, we won't go quietly"
No, we won't go quietly

[Outro: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
If we didn't fear each other, we could stand near each other
