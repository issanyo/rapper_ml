I prayed that the light in me to not only be held inside of me
But free the wrong with the right in me
Because the demon I was, they won't confide in me
I come from a religious background being raised a Christian of Barker Temple Church of God and Christ
Also studying Islam from 12-17 after my Christian mother married a Muslim
Mom loved that I rapped, she just wanted me to do it for Christ
But the worldly me began when I ran away from home at 17
And no matter how much better of a person I became
The worldly things I did would catch up with me
And try to pull me right back down
Right back down
Right back down
Right back down
Right back down
