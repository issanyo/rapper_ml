[Verse 1: Ryan Bradley]
I pull up slow 'cause you got somebody
No knock, no stone, just a text
And the next thing you know, you're here
Fuck the heartstring shit, let's explore your body
No hearts, no likes, just a night
In the white of the moon so clear
Playing with fire, we can't stop
It's getting hard to breath
Walking the wire, we're bound to drop
Baby, it's plain to see

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Verse 2: Ryan Bradley]
Skin tight, I fight, but there's no use lying
Adrenaline from the sin that we're in
Lay on back, I'll control your fears
Playing with fire, we can't stop
It's getting hard to breath
Walking the wire, we're bound to drop
Baby, it's plain to see

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love
Dangerous
Dangerous

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Didn't matter who you was dating
I snatched you with no patience
Made you dash to this location
Then I, had to hit no waiting
But I didn't know it was gonna be like that
Love came and hit me like splat
So I had to go tell every chick that was hanging on close to me like scat
And they ain't like it
So much negativity came to us from both sides
Yeah those exes tried to really detangle us, but those died
And we became enough
For each one of us, we aim to bust
At any motherfucker try'na stop this 'cause we dangerous

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
We're dangerous
Both of us
We break up and move on
Then we're back on the phone to making love
We're dangerous
The way we touch
We break up and move on
Then you're back in my arms to making love
