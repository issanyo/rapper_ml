[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I now pronounce me and music together, from now until the end of time

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Always on the road, doing hella shows
Day to day high and lows, but that's just how it goes
When you grinding, homie, ain't no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything and it's hard remembering
Places and faces they think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours
Autographs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans
Keep it rough with the fellas, but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real
While I'm wit' you with my wife another chance is killed
And my kids all three of 'em suffer in the worst ways
'Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain
Give me love 'cause these are three of the reason why I call the road the rain

[Hook]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

[Verse 2: Alyia Yates, (Tech N9ne) and  Reign Yates ]
My little girl said-
Daddy (What's up), me and Reign really miss you
Not to mention momma always need a tissue
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you
I heard you won't be home for Halloween, is this true?
(Right after Halloween baby) Yeah, I'm used to it
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music?
So we can travel everywhere that you're traveling
And be in the family, me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that, I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at?
Is Donny really coming to move with us in L.A.?
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday?
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down
There's not enough Tecca Nina's to go around
Reignbow's crying, she wants to talk to you badly
(What's up Reignbow, baby?)
I love you, daddy!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I love my fans 'cause they make it possible for me to provide for the fam
The fact that my life is in shambles, they could give a damn
When it shakes then they chose it, fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tender one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like:
Calling my wife when I'm in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
'Cause she lonely, you try to console her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what? You give them everything they need
But what they need is your presence indeed
Life yes has been a strainer, it's like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife, that's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain, more people to change
Swords deep in the game, the world's peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure, reaching for fame
Healthy relationship you can't have them, when you're living life in the rain

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I walk in the rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right, or is it wrong)

[Outro/Collision: Tech N9ne & wife]
So we did twenty shows, I got like thirty six more, you know what I mean?
So when you coming home?
