[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ever since my cradle date, or my prenatal state
I was blessed with the gift to disable hate
With fatal takes on the mic is makin' my halo break
And smash every lady workin' at Strange, call them my label-mates
I throw the squad up, them I'mma pour ya broad up
Genitals, so plentiful, ya chemical's low but shot up
Wishin' they'd slow the god up
But I ain't trippin' when I rip I'm twitchin'
They think that I be sniffing on Snow Tha Product
Bitch I might be, this a nice key, to get ya hyphy
Dick ya wifey, this for Ike
Slice of sin or source if ya see somethin' slither slightly
Step inside the surface of Strange, or simply sight-see
Spit the flow, get the dough, then I hit the ho
Mister irresistible twisted is this kiss the toes
I'ma kick ya nose if one of ya pricks oppose
I'm all he hates, cause I became a landmark like Ollie Gates
Maudie's great, tall estate, y'all debate, nigga, call me Yates

[Hook: Marcus Yates]
It's no challenge, it's no challenge at all
When you up the bar, it gets below average
Below average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though (x3)
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Lately I've been like fuck rap
What? Did he say "fuck rap"?
Oh no no, I'mma write in bold and plus caps
FUCK RAP
Cause all these tough cats really don't have no nutsacks
Trust that 'nuff scratch does back much wackness
Flush that shit
Down with the gowns with the sounds for the clowns
And not in a good way
You can drown underground with the pounds
When they gust that shit
Oh so, low we stojo, hoes and dough negro we flow though
Let the soul glo, mojo, nigga
Pillowcase, over the head of the industry
Illustrate, with my mouth and murders my ministry
Seal the fate of my enemy, feel the weight of my energy
I heal the hate. Facilitate. Disc jockey's with scrilla make
Them play your records until you break
Radio ain't nothing but real estate
It's still a fake deal of mates who ain't real awake
But the mill is great, ain't no iller ape that can kill a Yates

[Hook]
It's no challenge, it's no challenge at all
When you up the bar, it gets below average
Below average, killin' 'em, toetag 'em
I'ma let you be great though (x3)
But it ain't no stoppin' a Yates

[Verse 3: Marcus Yates]
I can keep my head, while everybody losin' theirs
No Marcus, I told you, don't start this debate
I'm all arsenal friend, we the median like, you feedin' me in
Tired of bein' with the intermediate
Faded on bullshit, control the whole medium
I done ran inside my meniscus
I done out-rapped everybody Christmas
So why in the hell would I fail?
If I do, I'm just being Ezale
Front line level, untamed, unchained
After all this shit, I remain on lane, loser
And that's what yo ass get for hittin' that snoozer
My brain is worth a few trillions, I don't get worked
So my verses hurts when they send me to kill 'em
I'm like Biblin' niggas, keepin' it blacker than Power Rangers
But why the name Zachary? No leashes, I'm free sucker
No reachin' no knee deep into mine
Like a comprehension of lines
Revisit them when you wanna hear that real wizard dim
Young and timeless, elite science, prominent and flyin'
And beat them beats to meet and greet but I conscience
