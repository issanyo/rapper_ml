I'm a playa, I'm a playa
(I'm a playa)
I'm a playa, I'm a playa, I'm a playa
(I'm a playa)
I'm a playa, I'm a playa, I'm a playa
(I'm a playa)
Oh, oh, oh, I'm a playa
(Yeah, Tech Tech Nina is a playa)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If you see me looking clean cut
Matching from head to toe, dipping with a mean strut
Throwing and blowing green stuff, hella creamed up with the bling cuff
Ain't no wicked, we can kick it if you blue or beamed up
If you, see me step off in the club or with some pros
With about six of 'em cut, no longer waiting to be chosen
If you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dipping to Davy's right when the clubber close
If you see me on the grind gettin' mine
If you bust in a room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes, rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line
If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them haters givin' me mugs
Ladies givin' me hugs
Know it ain't no rocket science it's because

Oh, oh, oh, I'm a playa
(Yeah, Tech Tech Nina is a playa)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
I'm gettin' money from these dummies flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars
I'm a playa when I don't or when I drop dollars
Them rottweilers
She don't want no softie sayi'n he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetratin' nine-to-fiver tryin' to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it crunk
No she don't
That's how it goes so my homie Kaliko, tell 'em what she want

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rolling them 22's and 3's, popping ludes and V's
I'm in, hot pursuit of a prostitute
Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot
And I'm pullin' out the latex
And givin' it to who's next
And pullin' pull a brunette
With unforgettable sex
She's oohin oohin new sweat
And I ain't tellin who's wet
And I ain't gettin loose yet
So who's next
For group sex

(Listen closely, this is something you might not know)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Never ever tell your love or else she'll get your love
Move in groups, no 101 when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies, throw away your ticket stub
If you sexin', learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water, don't put no soap on your washcloth
That way when you get home
No questions, you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap 'cause it will leave a scent
Don't tell a number 2 that she's your one and only
'Cause if she knows we're easy to go her own way
If you takin' chickens to your secret home, hey
Always go the back way to confuse 'em just go the long way
To all my ladies if you playin' throw your hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw your grands up
This is forever baby havin' clever thangs
I'm a playa mothafucka and I bet I never change
