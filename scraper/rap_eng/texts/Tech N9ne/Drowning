[Intro - Liz Suwandi]
Light looks different down here
Inside my diamond prison
And if I could reach the edge I would
Oh I'd take us somewhere if I could

[Hook - Liz Suwandi]
But I am slipping under water
The tide oh it's pulling me much farther
And maybe I am drowning
Maybe I'm drowning, oh I'm drowning

[1st Verse - Tech N9ne]
My Tsunami, my Katrina and my inner Sandy
Man it will not simmer expanding
If I swam seem like I would slam the damn thing
But I'm scrambling, falling like I damaged my hamstring
I'm deeply disturbed, so many things keep me perturbed
Inside of me peeping this surge and I'm completely submerged
My data wiped even if NASA had a sight
Couldn't catch it with N.O.A.A.'s ghost satellite
Storm's F-5 within I'm torn alive
Hearing the horns from high
Pain is for sure my eye
Having a lot of blackouts
Medics try putting me on medicine
But I need light
Just like the East need con Edison
I'm dead again
Drownin in everybody else's mess when
I got troubles that's been pullin me down
Ingesting water, no breath in
Look how it swept in
To evacuate or not evacuate?
Is the question

[Hook - Liz Suwandi]

[2nd Verse - Tech N9ne]
Teach me to swim, keep me from them
Eating the limbs and other body pieces from him
I may be wrong not to, play these songs, caught ya
When you got me drowning in my own Davy Jones locker
It's caving in, it's over weight
No saving him, he's freeloader bait
And everybody picks him then sticks him
But your rain and wind equal my shut down system
Yeah

[Hook - Liz Suwandi]
