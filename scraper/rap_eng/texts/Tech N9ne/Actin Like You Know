[Verse 1: Mackenzie O'Guin]
I know I walk a line
On the edge all the time
Waitin' for the next fight (Waitin' for the next fight)
Walk it off casually
You can call it apathy
I'll never lose face for you to see (I'll never lose face)

[Pre-Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin]
I don't forgive and forget when the wounds run deep
I need you far less than you need me

[Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin]
You're actin' like you know me when you really don't know
Every sinner casts out the very first stone
Actin' like you know what we're really all about
Think before you open up your mouth
You're actin' like you know

[Verse 2: Mackenzie O'Guin]
I think you need to learn your place
Talkin' bout how I was raised
Can't taint the blood in my veins (Can't taint the blood)
You don't get the world I'm in
Don't know the extremes I've lived
Strange is all I have in me at end (Have in me)

[Pre-Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin]
I don't forgive and forget when the wounds run deep
I need you far less than you need me

[Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin]
You're actin' like you know me when you really don't know
Every sinnner casts out the very first stone
Actin' like you know what we're really all about
Think before you open up your mouth
You're actin' like you know

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
How you gon', come talk about
Pointin' at me wit' ya number one out
Tellin' me I'm the worst like I'm some kind of a curse
But really not knowing me, you're taking the dumb route
It's always the people with skeletons
Who be hella shaky like gelatin
Doin' a lot of embellishin', wishin' I fell and then
Damned me to Hell again
If you're in a glass house
Might not wanna lash out
End up with a smashed couch
All because of your bad mouth
Judgin' me, you don't need to, that's the job that G-O-D do
Everybody is steady pickin' that reads you cause you see-through

[Hook: Mackenzie O'Guin] (x2)
You're actin' like you know me when you really don't know
Every sinnner casts out the very first stone
Actin' like you know what we're really all about
Think before you open up your mouth
You're actin' like you know
