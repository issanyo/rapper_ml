[Intro]
I was born in '71, in '72 I started to walk
'73, '74, in '75 I learned to talk
'76 I tried sexin', that was around the age of five
'77, '78 and '79 I started to ride with my Uncle Ike
In '80 and '81 I was about ten
But the first time a little chick made me cum
Was '82 or '83 my life really came alive
In '84 I was thirteen, but (1985's the number!)

[Verse 1]
I met this bitch
Who told me if I got tight with her, together we would grow rich
Type of chick that'll make a brother feel good inside
In my mind when I sleep woke, when I walk, when I ride
Gettin' to me in the classroom
Used to follow me into the bathroom and I loved it
She was wild and everyday (People bore me)
Captivate, activate my hormones when you speak to me softly
Offer me a piece of you cause (Me so horny)
She let me foreplay and that's it
She said if I would rap and make some dollars for us maybe I can get a hit
I was writin', then I found myself fightin' for the juices
When I found out that our little agreement's non-exclusive (Ah, damn)
She let celebrity status hit, so I'm thinkin' of tactics
How to leave ran down prophylactics on the mattress
So I practice, hopin' to stuff my fat dick in this rap bitch
Knowin' when I put my cactus in that catfish I'mma flat shit
She's turnin' me into a (Killa!)
Devour fools, I'm powerful like (Mechagodzilla!)
She said if I keep rappin' she'll keep clappin', but ain't nobody strappin'
'Til she see paper and then we'll see what's happenin', and I hear her say

[Hook] (2X)
You heard of Tech, he's like the best
He built his nest in the Midwest
The boy can flow and he be bustin' like
(Boom, boom)
It's like I'm stuck, I feel I'm cursed
About to load the Nina Tech cause in a sec
I'm finna be bustin' like (Boom, boom)

[Verse 2]
'93 she invited me to a party in L.A
So popular, she introduced me to 2Pac the next day
She took me to this party in Beverly Hills
Where me and Chris Tucker couldn't get in
Because of our ball caps and they was all about dollar bills
She was a G and got us all in for free (Ran into Pac again)
She talked about him so tough I knew she was (Cockin' him)
But I never did hate, because I knew heated sex was our fate
As I got clever and a lot better
She started lettin' me and my boys hit together
Me and Pac hit the slot, now it's out in the open
Didn't take long to make her get it on
Came so strong, and "Thugs Get Lonely Too" was our slogan
She wanted me and Chino XL, but he backed off and said: "That's hell"
He don't dip into every female waitin' to exhale with a wet tail
Wish I could be with baby daily
But I recall The Veteran Click sayin': "Tech, don't turn a tramp into yo lady"
I don't know why I want this bitch, she always diss
And won't let me showcase my shit, this bitch is driving Nina crazy

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3]
Fuck this, I'm ready for one on one ruckus
Still she like: "Don't touch this" when I'm alone with her
It's on when the bone hit her, get her
Hoeing off in L.A. with my folks
Me and Yuk, Phats, Gonz, L.Q., Max Key
Hella knocking your back out, bitch, long strokes
You a nympho, who the pimps though? (Me and Roger Troutman)
Had you at Juan Momma house (Shoutin')
Through the talk box you exhaust cocks
And you ought not ever get caught hot
Why she always gotta have the vault lock
Kinda mad when I really thought back
Me and RZA hit that ass on the video set Why did we hit (Raw)
Bitch told us how she fucked Eminem, Kool G
KRS, Monch, Xzibit and (All) type a niggas
When Felony fucked he said: What-what-what-what?
I was next in line right after he busted his nut-nut-nut-nut
I heard my homey Rodney say she want me and Lynch to hit
Sac and MO dick and she said she wanted it so bad cause we so sick
I saw you at 92.3 The Beat with Jay-Z and Damon
I know at times I'm hella complex, but now I'mma put it in lamens
I wanna fuck you not with Jimmy Jam, not with Terry Lewis
Not with Quincy Jones, not with QD3, just me and you
And I'mma show you all the things that I can do
Go platinum plus get trapped in your lust
So I'm hoping me and you can (Bang, bang!)
I know you're a groupie ho, but I still want your coochie though
Before I go I want you to tell these people yo name: ("Rap Game")
