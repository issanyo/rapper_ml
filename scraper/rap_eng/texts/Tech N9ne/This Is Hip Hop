[Intro: Tech N9ne]
When I say "Tech", you say "N9ne!"
Tech (N9ne!), Tech (N9ne!)

[Chorus]
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
What is livin' on 904 Michigan?
What is havin' roaches and trouble findin' more dividends?
Dyin' a poor citizen
What is bars in the door to seal us in
War kill us men, tryin' for your kid again
What is savin' your pay to go stay in a available place
In the way 'cause you ain't paying no janx when the Yate makes a way to rotate
What is weight in your safe? So we can stay in your race
Lay 'em on tape invading your state with this pain in your face
What is the door slam? They ain't with the program
The bidness give a damn, you go HAM, you giving 'em more stamina
What is having a manager bookin' many shows to go jam?
What is at the bottom? They don't really gotta
What is in a column without another who stopped him
Dropped him, popped and chop him, what is summer, spring and autumn?
What is dope and to the top and shot him what is poverty?
What is acknowledging a prodigy?
What is the dichotomy of this good and bad anthology?
What is lads that follow the sad path Sickology?
What is livin' life low, then livin' like you hit the lottery

[Chorus]
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
When I first heard the beat, it gave me the vision that if the
Mayan calender was correct and in 2012 the world was actually destroyed
When a new civilization forms and they get to diggin' they find this
And this will be a perfect way to start off the new hip-hop culture
You know what I'm sayin'? We're two murderers lyrically
You know what I'm sayin'? It'd be crazy
Strange, baby!

[Verse 2: Brotha Lynch Hung]
What is gettin' off the X and writin' an album?
What is being put in the middle like Malcolm?
Sicker than sarcoidosis
I eat Carrion, I got body parts in my Carry-On
That's when the party starts, nigga, I'm very hung
Been rippin' up niggas since I was very young
Scary-lookin' motherfucker, ready to kill your daddy's mom
Ready to eat that meat with a meat cleaver
I creep in the streets and defeat these
Eat these niggas up hot shittin' out their feces
Put a knife in their nieces
At least he's younger, hunger, dinner
He sees thunder, one nut in her
He sees baby, doctor visit
He spills rabies in his lyrics
Put her in the back with the flat tire, I'm fire 'till I retire
I tie her up and then fry her up and then give her to the higher up
Tech N9ne intertwine, get out the wine
This is my kind of hip-hop

[Chorus]
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop
It's country, jazz and R&B and it's pop
It's rock and roll and yeah never will it stop
So ain't no way you stoppin' this hip-hop, hip-hop
This is hip-hop

[Outro (Reversed): Tech N9ne]
To all my youngsters out there listening to this:
Find some sort of education or understanding of life and how it was
And then try to find out how you can continue to grow this thing
And better this thing and take this thing to higher heights with
More knowledge and more conviction to preserve this thing called hip-hop!
