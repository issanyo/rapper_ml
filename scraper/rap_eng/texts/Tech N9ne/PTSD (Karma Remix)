[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A verticle leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Karma]
I'm stuck in a vacant void
Stumbling, every step I take
I try to make a noise
And I'm thinking 'bout screaming for help but I can't think straight
I'm never complacent
With myself and I always feel basic
I need help and I'm never gon' take it
Cause the med isn't helping, I can't even taste it
You don't know me
And don't ever think you can try and show me how to fix this
There ain't a pill in the world that can save me from this position
My disposition is uneasy
How can I make you listen
Publicity stunts and events but I'm feeling queasy
[This shit ain't easy
Don't try to diagnose my problem 'cause you ain't been me
And I've been working harder
But more haters been staying, hating me
They're waiting patiently for me to drop new shit
Then come drop their shade on me
But I stay looking for the light
It's hard to find when eyes are open, lying awake every night
But now I'm here to fight and I'm here to stay
Although I'll hate it I'm working 'til everyone here knows my name

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here
