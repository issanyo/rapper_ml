[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Trying to search for zen
On this dying Earth we're in
No denying my thirst for skin
With the heat frying, the curse begins

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My taste carrier seeks the blood of an angel, how can I mangle?
Make terrier teeth from straight tearing her meat
Yates buried her deep, I don't wanna eye everything die like the great barrier reef!
It's a bad moon, mad gloom, giving stab wounds
Sucking a soul up like a vacuum
Monkey, apes, and baboons in the classroom
Wanting to be upper class and cash coons, mass doom
Then I woke up, choked up
Glad it was a dream and now I wanna go pick a lotus
But the grass is low cut, no fluff
Wish I could say hocus pocus
With the bees and pollen in focus
So the food we need isn't bogus
Fake feedings, race leading to death
Everybody's race leading great eating's for breath
Dreams based on real spill quick to leave you in a chill
Told my doctor this, he said I need Jesus and a pill

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
See, it doesn't matter what I want
I think what is done is done
Everything is dead to me
Losing my ability, to be
In touch with reality
Oh, I need Jesus and a pill!

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
I wake up to a new day
Then it all comes crumbling down
I don't wanna be here anyway
Well here it comes again
Let it in

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Taking a journey through the depths of my psychosis
Multiple personalities adamantly ferocious
At first in agony, angrily cope a closed fist
Err on the side of caution if you try to approach bitch
A mental breakdown, suffocating with hate now
No escape for heavensake, there ain't nobody safe now
I'm thinking of killing 'em all, afterlife I'm sending 'em off
Outta line, outta time, so out of my mind and outta control
Tell me why am I thinking these thoughts
Skin burning at the sign of a cross
Somebody help me I think that I'm lost
Edge of insanity I have been tossed
Mayday, got a man down, better pray for safe space now
Stay away or become prey when I rampage and I spray rounds
Pharmaceutical holocaust, a little bit lyrical Molotov
Serial killer like Michael with a knife and the rifle I'm psyched and I'm popping off
So let me say this, you don't wanna say shit
End up another screaming victim on my playlist

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
See, it doesn't matter what I want
I think what is done is done
Everything is dead to me
Losing my ability to be
In touch with reality
Oh, I need Jesus and a pill!

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
How can I be so sure that
Anything could help me now
I wanna believe you
And if I fall
God help us all

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
Everything is dead to me
Losing my ability to be
In touch with reality
Oh, I need Jesus and a pill!
