[Verse 1]
Everybody go and get dumb diddy dum
While I pull out the Rum 151 and the Juice mixin the Malibu so you can make the Caribou
Oh look, there goes Lou, he's out in the pool
While you look a fool, I took y'alls big tool
Everybody see the pick and they take a lick
When they see it sick and then they get their wits
Then they get real quick when they think they're slick rick
But, no, I gotta go show, and I gotta go flow and I can't but I gotta go slow with the dough
Oh wait no, what a hoe, name starting with a J and hell everyone knows
They know that the swigs that she takes and the hits that they break
When they know damn well that the bitch is fucked up though
Back to the lecture tho, I gotta tell you, you getting fucked up when I say shit like
"Bitch and Fuck when I lick the rut they swing in the hut"
So just shut the fuck up and don't have shit coming out your mouth
Because bullshit makes you go and Get It Twisted
All these motherfuckers and their hunters wanna pull up on my brothers, but they'll never get to the when they think of the fucking cutters when I'm pulling up the shutters
But when they see what I do for a living and how I keep the bells ringing
They all know how I flow
I don't go after the dough
Don't talk no shit cause You Getting It Twisted

[Hook: ApolloX & Tech N9ne]
(So Dope They Wanna)
Go in the party
Don't get lethargy
If you do then you can't be
(So Dope They Wanna)
Every body go up
Don't get sorry
Because if you do then you're gonna Get It Twisted (x2)

[Verse 2]
So now back to it and lah diddy lah lah
Going faster but keeping the same pace on the master
I'm the caster when I blast her you will be on a plaster
Cause I'm dastardly deadly when I felt thee and smelled she
Kinda held the LP up on the shelf see when I welt thee and I dealt thee
Three kings while I say Gregory
(Yo, X!)
What you want?
(The fuck are you talking about?)
Don't care what they say if they ain't if it ain't even a G
Then fucking fling the Prada that she wear all over her damn sauna
(X!!!!)
Whoa watch out, got someone that could be listening and she could question what I guessin when I bested
And I tested and the rest and all the Hester while Lester is keeping on a fester of damn wrestlers
Fuck all that just pass the Caribou Lou
While your taking just two
You'll see you're a fool
And you'll see that you're full
And you'll see that this drink is just really cruel
When you wake up you'll be like "Damn, yo what the fuck just happened?"
All the snitches and bitches that wanna go and get stitches better go and tell now
Oh wait you won't even be down for a second round
When we tell you don't do that and we tell you don't do this
You better not go and get it fucking Twisted
Because ima put your head in a piston
Then I bet you won't get it twisted ever again

[Hook]

[Break: ApolloX]
All these people know no equal never seeing what is fecal
But just know that I am different, make you bounce and there's no sittin
But just listen when I spit this, knowing this is a flowing distance
Caribou Lou, my left hand holds it. My girls ass, my right hand gropes it

[Hook]
