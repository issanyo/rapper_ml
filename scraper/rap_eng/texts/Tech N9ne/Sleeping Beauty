[Intro: Krizz Kaliko (backwards) & Tech N9ne]
Such a cutie
Sleeping beauty

[Tech N9ne]
It was a Saturday night me and my homeboys decided to dip to the movies
And you know us
Always on CP time
So we enter the theater and we find our seats
Kaliko wanted me to get something from concessions, so I did
So I'm waiting in line and I get to the register
And I see the baddest bitch homie (Damn)
I mean I was like fuck the food what's your name, nationality and age baby
But I forgot the first two when she said she was, 17!
On the inside I was like, fuck, shit, goddamn it, motherfucker, ya bitch, whore, slut, cunt
When you gonna be 18?
And in the midst of my crisis I heard her say, "Well I'll be eighteen in a week"
And I was like, "Oh yeah?"
And she said, "Yeah"
Man she was a stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like ooh
I had to have her cat
Deja vu

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm in the movie and I don't give a fuck about it
I keep thinkin' about the bitch I met at concessions
Really a cutie I wanna get up in her body
But the identity saying she is 1-7
Fuck the movie I'ma go back and spit at her
Throw rap and shit at her like my name is Tech N9ne bitch
When I said it she went ballistic meaning she was with it
And loving my complex rhyme shit (Yes, yes)
I had a brilliant idea to get her back at the crib
And I'll give her some of the bad mimosa
The crib I really went IKEA got everythizzle
If it's comfortable to her then I can hold her
For about week then on her b-day
We can wheezay
She doesn't know that I'm S-I-C-K (Sick)
All she know is T-E-C-C-A
When you're through working baby you're gonna go with me kay?
(Okay, Okay, Okay, O-O-Okay)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I want you, sleeping beauty
I need you, sleeping beauty
So young but such a cutie
I love you, sleeping beauty

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne & Girl]
Come right in baby, have a seat (Alright)
Would you like a drink? (Sure, I'll have one)
And another, and another, and another
(I don't feel so well)
And then another, and then another, and then another
(I'm getting dizzy...)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Very woozy
We up in the Jacuzzi
Beauty is juicy
The liquor must have been a doozy (Yes)
Cause she talking hella loosely
Trying to seduce me
But I ain't fucking no under aged groupie
But I wish I was fuckin' and suckin', buckin', crushin' and touchin'
And tuckin' my stuff in the pretty muffin
But she started huffin' and puffin' and talkin' 'bout nuthin'
The fact that I won't get no lovin' is fuckin' pushin' my buttons
Bitch with your fast mouth
I want you to pass out
Then I'ma get your ass out (Yup)
Shit she crashed out
Gotta get her out or she'll be dead soon
Drug her to the motherfucking bedroom
Handcuffed her then I turned the music down (Knock, knock, knock)
Then I heard a pound (Who is it?) (Knock, knock, knock)
Knock a little more (What the fuck)
Somebody's knock, knock, knock, knocking at my door yo

[Bridge 2: Tech N9ne & Cop]
Is there a problem officer?
(Yeah we got a noise complaint from one of your neighbors, uh you having a party?)
Uh no it's just me here man I'm a musician
(We know who you are)
And uh I'm scoring a movie that's my projector you hear and the music's already down so
(Well let's try and keep it down)
Uh, I'll keep her - uh, keep it, keep it down, I'll keep it down

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I want you, sleeping beauty
I need you, sleeping beauty
So young but such a cutie
I love you, sleeping beauty

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hey I can hardly wait
It's getting closer to our date
It's been a couple of days I had to gag her
Back and forth to the bathroom I had to drag her (Come on)
Cause the drugs I'm giving her make her stagger
Trying to feed her food but it's making me want to stab her (Bitch)
With the steak knife I tried to feed her steak with (Come on)
Okay when you starve to death don't say shit (Bitch)
I'ma set it to the side 'til you're hungry
I see that your energy's telling me that you want me (She wants me)
She said, "I never knew that you would be the one to be psycho
Why you reading to me from the bible (No)
Get away from me motherfucker I hate you" (Hate me)
On the morning of your b-day I'ma take you (Yes)
Days go by
And I'm looking in her hazel eyes
I wanna be her sex slave, know why?
Cause you're beautiful lovely (Yes)
Want you to trust me (Yes)
And never judge me (Yes)
Now do you love me?

[Bridge 3: Tech N9ne & Girl]
(I love you, I really love you)
Oh, fuck
(I wanna feel you, I wanna touch you)
Oh yes, oh yes
(Take me out of these cuffs, I wanna hold you)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Look at her sexy ass
Beautiful panties see through like plexiglass
Rip 'em off of her like an animal mesh we clash
At the bottom she put her hand up on my Nestea bags
Heavy kissin' and heavy pushin'
And if this is heaven then I wanna stay
Lord please never take it away
Happy birthday baby this is how I'm gonna be lovin' ya (Yeah)
Then she put the steak knife through my jugular (Shit!)
Now as the blood trickles, my body wiggles
I'm looking up at my beautiful baby while she giggles (Ha, ha, ha)
I never thought that it would end this way (Way)
This is not how I wanted to spend this day (Day)
The webs we weave are so damn tangled (Yes)
I really guess my baby didn't like my angle (No)
I lie in a puddle of blood neck mangled (Dead)
I was done by the hands of an angel

[Outro: Reporter, Man, & Woman]
In breaking news
Rapper Tech N9ne was found murdered today at the hands of an eighteen year old girl
He is survived by his wife, and three children
More details at ten
My dear woman! We can't bury this man without prayer!
There is nothing to pray for, sir
He has entered a much better world than this...
At least so you ministers always say, sir
