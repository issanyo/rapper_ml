[Intro]
Tell you the reason why my brick wall is up
I was at her mom's house, in her basement
Waitin for her to bring me some food to eat
She's takin a really long time
So I thought I'd creep up the stairs to startle her
And I heard her on the phone... and she said:
"I know... that it couldn't be Donny's baby
Because me and Donny use condoms"
I couldn't walk, man

[Verse 1]
Once bitten, twice shy for the nice guy
Always afraid of the beginnin' but the endin' might lie
Women sin just like men I never been like why
Cause my heart has been torn apart and I really felt my life die
Since, then, I put up a wall
20 foot tall, if they climb it they surely to fall
Out of love, but not lust
Cause a thug has got cut
But the blood has been mopped up
Now my drug is a hot fuck
They swore they would never be phony
Like whores, it was never me only
My Lord, I would rather be lonely
Fool me once, shame on you; twice, shame on me

[Bridge]
"What are you doing... I want you to come over
I left the door unlocked, and... oh my god"

[Hook]
It doesn't have to mean anything (x3)

[Verse 2]
Hurt me once then I'm an idiot if I stay
Cause I'm hoping that twice that ain't no kinda game that I play
Her knife was jagged but now I have it my way
I just grabbed it without feelin I stabbed it pipe-lay
Yeah shallow, but I'm hurt-free now though
Been suffering silently for so long this is my growl
Now they sayin I don't feel enough
Cause I don't wanna be wonderin if it's real or what
Broke up with me once, I came right back like a dunce
But then the second was funk, now I'mma be really blunt
That really stirred N9ne
We lovers in her mind
Broke up with me twice and you don't get a fucking third time

[Bridge]
Listen to me... you don't have to spend the night
You can just come over for a little while
I'm not gonna tell anybody, I swear to god

[Hook]
It doesn't have to mean anything (x6)

Oh my god... you look so younger than earlier
And I can still smell you on me
I just wanna taste you, just for tonight
It doesn't have to mean anything (x6)
