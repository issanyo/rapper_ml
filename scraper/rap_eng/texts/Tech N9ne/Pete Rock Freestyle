[Intro: Smoke DZA]
Don't five finger me
A different energy
I done beat that like three times already, yah
I got some space

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Yeah, look
I'm up in Wells Fargo
Tendin' to cargoes
Vince McMahon walk, my checks retard-o
You Mini Coopers still at the car show
I cracked lobster crabs, shrimp the scar go
Hunnid dollar shots at the Cosmo
How I stay this cool only God knows
I took the verbs out the freezer
Got a third senorita
Hope to world she a heater
Independent, she don't need no body
Ass so good she don't need no body
Never knew you, wanted me to do you
When I go to Bonnarooboo, you comin' too, Drew
I wear my Yeezy's in the rain, give you hype beasters
Nightmares, Dangy Dangs
I want the money and the fame
Billboards, awards, and thangs
Of course this is uh

[Bridge: Tech N9ne and  Smoke DZA ]
That was Gucci, man
Thank you, thank you Tech
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Now Tech's in the do'
Rep my set but I get respect in the MO
Fetched them checks then effin' your ho
Epinephrine, less but yet I'm blessin' you tho
Vexed be the vet when they question the flow
I am not the same as you
I am strange and I claim Ragu
I'm just sayin' a nigga ain't had blue
On my brain but back when I never became gradu
With a flame flag you, I aim my name at you
I am sinister, I am evil brain and more heart is ministered
Pray over the widow and then I finish her
With the genital's chemical imbalance
My minotaur, miniature
Illin' it I itchin' it I'm into the, Indica
Much worse and I bust first
Without touch, squirtin'
Without butt furtions
Just workin'
On us burpin'
On nut surfin'
No fuck fucktions, Yahtzee!
All today's niggas are Nazis
Call up my colors come and kill ya, crazy as cops be
Try me, nigga, try me, ain't no use in tryna calm me
You tryna bomb me
Just like Syria I'm Gandhi
Not like Fonzie, you try to screw me, Imma chop yo ass, nigga
OG Ronsi

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Jesus resurrected, Lazarus, turn water to wine
I quadruple the pounds, turn 'em all into dimes
Erbody got the answers, blind leadin' the blind
I pass off the good vibe
We all rollin' up but I'm rollin' up the good kind
Death president schemes, we all got a wood bind
Toast to the good times
Success in higher positions
Misplaced checks, John Geiger edition
Only fire I'm spittin'
Never fibbin', no fabrication
All the shit I be livin', uhh
If one time pull up then Imma eat the bud
I just got forty from my Korean plug, right
I want the money, you can keep the love
And when it all stops, I want you boys to fear me
Like ertime the ball drop, I'm on top
And everytime I'm on top, you on cock
The next move I make watch jaws drop
Yeah, air you niggas all out
Uhh, yeah that's it, I'm all out

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm just tryna try
When haters do what they do and steady hidin' the lie
Laughing while we, ridin' and high
Cause we know that they ladies will let us slide in their pie
Yeah, they call us nook nook crooks
Cause all they hear from the room is Babadook-dook-dook
Freeze, at ease
Whoever said Tech Nina ain't the shizzy is a busta deluxe with cheese
My foot is ready to touch ya and scuff the 3's
You couldn't move 'em with a Mustard beat plus with Yeez
Cause you's a sorry mother-sucker, I'll buck ya then puff the trees
I'm for real
Do I kill it, certainly so
Your lady say she don't 'member ever squirting before
Till she had this player in the middle of the west, a flirtin' negro
I knocked her way down to coach from her Birkin ego
Ya heard it?!
(I heard it!)
Let's give it up for the KC King
But I never wanna get up in the race, we sing
When I get up on a beat, I'ma bake these schemes
Look at the Nina
I'm comin' at you with a team of cleaners
Rippin' and packin' arenas
Thinkin' he better then he be the dreamer, whoop

[Outro: Smoke DZA]
Bust that deluxe vagine tho
