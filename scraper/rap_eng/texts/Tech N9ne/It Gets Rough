[Intro: Grant Rice]
Grant Rice!

Empire!
You gotta get 'em Tech, it's my shit yo!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Tecca Nina's full of malice of taking enough
Fuck you faggots with a balance of shaking him up
Knocking you down I'm pounding and waking you up
Fear what I do, hear what I do nigga when I drop you I'm breaking you up
Everybody wanna label me call me insane,  cause a nigga put a diffe-rence into the game
Call me crazy with a k and you can call me bane
Hey motherfucker you motherfucker don't you hate cause I'm increasing the range
Music ain't got that [?] and I'm bringing it back
Fucking you with that funk and I'm 'bout make you attack
Hitting niggas with the bomb and put you in yo sack
Irritable formidable shit is what I got is what you lack
Empire with a beautiful title for us
Strange Music we fucking motherfuckers up
All you pussies I'm blatantly calling you bluff
[?] me yo shit ain't rugged enough
It gets rough! (I came to bring the pain)
It gets rough! (You fools you've seen the same)
It gets rough! (You have no green to gain)
It gets rough your stuff it ain't tough enough this is rough!
It gets rough! (I came to bring the pain)
It gets rough! (You fools you've seen the same)
It gets rough! (You have no green to gain)
It gets rough your stuff it ain't tough enough this is rough!
