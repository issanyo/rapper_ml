[Intro:]
Yeah *laughter*
Go right up

[Verse 1]
Connect, ain't nobody but Tech
I been dope since I put raps on BASF cassette
Since then my pen been at war like Montagues and Capulets
A menacing strap you get, been winning in rap who's next
To get permanent power polluted, paper protruded
Punani praise on its pubics and they're prepared to pursue it
Get us then we drills em
Having plenty thrills um Wellington, New Zealand banging her with a chest like Wendy Williams
Everybody know with the kinda money I bring to the table I can put em on
Take em all around the world, get the dough and get the girl touching other people and I brought the hood along
Teams where I wings fly, things die but the king's eye people never seen cry
If you wanna see the mean side just go stream what I seen on steam, put your hand in my bean pie
Salam Baseem, Hakim and Keuh Rameen
I'm something fierce, I bring player haters to tears with my schemes
Come reach me, I got the species locked and no one can beat me
The feces, what I released on this beat he's gonna wanna seek me because I'm the WeeFee

[Hook]
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you're set in stone, I'm the
WeeFee

[Verse 2]
People need me, I'm the WeeFee
I get them on movies and TV
Connecting Scooby and Stevie
Straight from Missouri to Fiji
Trying to intrigue me ain't easy
Unless you bringing them bad beasies in three-bies
We be having them louder than 194 dB
Organ, grinding, so they pour us in their mouth, and they're loving it like Thorazine
When they freaking out I'm Jim Morrison
But I go without hair Billy Corgan
Releasing a lot more of them endorphins
WeeFee wins the war again the gores been like a horror film
Cause we kill, everything so be still
When we move in, not a cheap thrill
When the beat feels like E pills
Steadily repping B till, my B-L-double O-D spills
Then again Tech Nina keep mills
So I know I'mma get me a refill
Tech is highly respected
Been with a few major labels and left it
I rated my records intrepid
Since they didn't rep it then F it
Now I'm elected to get the check and invest it
I'm such a vet you can bet that I can get you connected
Cause I'm the WeeFee

[Hook]
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you're set in stone, I'm the
WeeFee

[Verse 3]
If you with me but hating me
Disconnect from me, get away from me
Get a bit of fake thinkin' they're big as your paper be
When they try to shake a G they normally have to take a fee that's lower than what they pay for he that works in M&M Bakery
You doubt a N9ne, you out of sight, you out of mind
Nigga shout a crime from me they sniffing them powder lines
I'm the righteous
But I kill a man like I'm Cypress
Play me like I'm not the nicest
No WeeFee leave you lifeless
Taking a knife to fight with ISIS, I like it
When they spite they get vices
When they hit that pipe think they're psychic
Wanna figure my mic and try to slice it
But they do fizzle when they hear SuWu whistles
Disrespect me true this will happen and they lose signal
This was long awaited
Strange is how all the fakes were created
They think they made it, forgot about me and skated
They music, everybody played it cause I was right there to save it
They downgraded they hate it cause their signal is faded
Cause I'm the WeeFee, nigga

[Hook]
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
I can put you on
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
With my push alone
WeeFee, WeeFee, WeeFee
Now you're set in stone, I'm the
WeeFee
