[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]

Sunday mornin' I awaken
Headache from the night befo'
Me and my niggas at the bowlin' alley trippin'
Cuz we all tough
I'm reminiscing, kinda laugh
Despite my pain
Cuz they kick us out for throwing balls
In other peoples lane
Sunny day in the Summa
It's 'bout to become a cloudy one
I be from previous buff
Devious sluts
Mischievous stuff
Pick up the phone
[?]
I got my niggas on the line
Ready to swoop the N9ne
Once again, I'm grabbin' a [?]
But today, I'm not gonna take these bitches to the west [?]
Just me and my road dogs, some road hogs

(More coming soon)
