[Intro]
For the 9-5!
(I talk about) Vampire
(I talk about) Nosferatu
(I talk about) Shut up!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This is the end of the line
How can you diss Tech the N9ne?
Ain't it a shame? I bring pain to your brain
Emcees are headless just like Ichabod Crane
You gots to suffer (Rocks!)
This is not (Props!)
IcyRoc [?] your box, so wicked watch
(The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out
In your stomach and out your mouth)
Hit me
Yes see the killer
Can you see the terror?
Step in the booth
Now with a soul to prepare ya
Nosferatu got you dumbfound in sound
And sick when I hit ya, now I flip shit with the

[Phlaque]
Bicker, bicker
All you niggas got me bent
Claiming you're heaven sent, you need to repent
[?], set your notebook on fire!
That's right by ya, this is what you perspire

[Tech N9ne]
Stuck up in that ass just like Oscar Mayer
Got all this time, ready to retire
816, eight sixteen
Now I flip. You've seen?
Complex styles, so wild you can find me in the X-Files
But I'm out to get you, I'm out to shock you
Watch you
Surprised that I'm grimmer than Ozzy
Now I gotta laugh like Fozzie
Waka Waka Waka
You fraud-like fake motherfucka
You take in figure

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)
I can get grim on this nigga (You got to take in figure)
I can get grim on this nigga (You got to take in figure)
I can get grim on this nigga (You got to take in figure)
I can get sick and kick on a punk bitch, cha!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You fool, bite my style like Dracul
Studying why and how I flips my tool
When I get yo punk ass I won't let go
I gets parents petrol when I use words like Necro
Catch my next [?] yo, I bet yo, Tech won't last
They put me on with you, they push ejecto
Imperfecto, I'mma slimer, slime ya
A lyrical, ecto, villain, and I'm a loser like Beck yo
(Presto) strange yo
I bring the razor glow
Deranged and yo (Tech say hello)
I got you niggas shaky like jello
You wonder if that's your boyfriend
Like was yellin' "Nigga don't tell yo"

[Phlaque]
Hello
It's the Phlaque and I'm back
To extract the souls from the klepto-maniac
I'mma bring it back, oratory
Getting with the crew
If you ain't with it
Fly fly fly

[Tech N9ne]
You must wanna die
Off with his head, (yeah) let him hang high (yeah)
Rockin' my style like you rock Karl Kani
For real you look at me, you wonder why I'm getting ill
I'm tryna blow up just like Fire Marshal Bill
So let me show you somethin' like a crucifix
Maybe that shit will keep you away from my lyrics
(Vampire), like Phlaque would say, [?]
No remorse for you when you burn (in the fire)

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
You have stepped in six feet under six feet
The area where ordinary people can't sleep
The badness, we had this back in high school classes
You're dealin' with three faces of madness
We're livin' in misery, Missouri, you can feel the fury
The pain, In Bloom like my name was Cobain
I'm grimmer than the Crypt-Keeper
Grimmer than the Grim Reaper
That's our way
Oh yeah, I forgot to say
"Welcome to doomsday, fraud!"
'Bout to kick that ass just like Jean-Claude
Frontin' from the crew, your rappin' days are through
Fake-ass nigga, they're all gonna laugh at you (they're all gonna laugh at you)
Tihs kcuf, better get out my way before I'm pissed off
Vampire, niggas straight soft
You wonder, "What does it take to make a bass drop"
Yippee ki-yay, motherpop! Motherpop-pop!

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (x2)
