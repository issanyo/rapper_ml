[Intro]
Greetings earthlings
I am your new leader
Follow me up in the sky
I am oh oh so high

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm so high, (I'm so high)
And I ain't coming down soon, keep him
From around you, watch him
He gon' clown you
I'm so fly, (I'm so fly)
And I can fly around you, never
Coming down true, king a
Mountain crown you

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Coming in for landing
When he touch down people actin' like it
They can't stand him, but they can't handle him
Barefoot and you can't sandal him
Even if I was outta my shell
Baby you couldn't scramble him, tandem
Even with a tan I'm brighter than y'all
Baited them haters then slay 'em, never to fall
You're a guppy, I'm an oscar
You're an Emmy, I'm an Oscar
Slow moving I'mma NOS ya
Amateur and I'm Sinatra
We the realest you're a iffy imitation or imposter
When I tell you I'm high, I'm sky-scraping
Observin' his vertical while you watch 'im elevate and think
What if you was up in the atmos-phere
You could see the whole atlas here
Is a record just in case of my absence
So when I say I'm getting high
I don't need no lighter or matches

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm so high (I'm so high)
And I ain't coming down soon, keep him
From around you, watch him
He gon' clown you
I'm so fly (I'm so fly)
And I can fly around you, never
Coming down true, king of
Mountain, crown you

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
(Ta-hahaha
Ayo Kali watch this)
I control the Doppler reading
It's Mr. Rain Man and it's Aquafining
High I'm too high above you hobbits meaning
I'm way too big for you to intervene or see me
That's cocky and arrogant yes
Like the American government you in trouble
When it's involved in a terrorist threat
Show up and blow up, but never seen the smithereens
From tore up my clothes are the same thing as grenadine
Kutty the bloody machete equal to Serengeti
From B.L.E.V.E. to Feature, you muthafuckas ain't still ready
Wicked and different, on the tip you don't qualify for
And oh did I mention I'm on a tip you don't qualify for?
Boom shaka, uhhh, Chaka Khan
Bringin' the triggers, you niggas need to stop the non-sense
Since I was a kid I been advised and tried to stay fly

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm so high (I'm so high)
And I ain't coming down soon, keep him
From around you, watch him
He gon' clown you
I'm so fly (I'm so fly)
And I can fly around you, never
Coming down true, king of
Mountain, crown you

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
My ears are poppin' everytime I wake up I'm off in a beezy
Baby wanna get the Milky Way from my penis!
High as a comet, I put the rocket up on it
I get supersonic and I never shoot it up into Venus!
I be the space invader, haters ain't mattering
Haters in heaven, I cannot get all the chattering
You wanna see me ya better bring God's ladder in
I run a ring around all of 'em like Satur-n
They call me conceited and they get mad at me
But they know ain't nobody as bad as he
You can't get on my level with pawn strategy
'Cause I'mma continue to defy gravity
Look up in the sky baby, I came up flamed up
And ready ain't nobody can tame us
Try to come and get us with something that's heinous
Man I'm puttin' my foot in Uranus
I'm so high

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm so high (I'm so high)
And I ain't coming down soon, keep him
From around you, watch him
He gon' clown you
I'm so fly (I'm so fly)
And I can fly around you, never
Coming down true, king of
Mountain, crown you

[Outro]
Follow my afterburner
Don't get close, it might burn ya
Stay on the ground, let ya learn ya
Extraterrestrial away up in the sky
I'm so high
