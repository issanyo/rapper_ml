[Intro]
I'ma put my best foot forward on this night
Put a couple of hands of grease in my hair
And in my eyebrows and now I'm tight
I wanna be with a woman and just this one
But the taste of blood is still on my tongue
If I could just eat food instead of her D boobs
I want this one alive when the morning comes

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a normal boy
Just wanna be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
Then she can be my number one
Lady!
I just wanna be a normal boy
Just wanna be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
Then she can be my number one
Lady!

[Verse]
Oh please, oh please, oh please
Just give me just one more clit
One more tit, one more bitch
What does I gotta do to get me fixed?
'Cause I gotta have this one in my mix
She's so beautiful I would slit
Both my wrists, if she split
When she finds out that I'm so sick
I eat women
I really eat women
They're really delicious
I gotta be normal so I can make her the Mrs
I gotta date with her so I can tell her my wishes
Even though I'm a beast but she don't know that I'm vicious
So I meet her at her place and she's so sweet
Made me dinner but really want her meat
From her cheek, maybe her feet
I'm trying to be discrete
But I really want to eat her out
Completely, teach me
To keep it away from her
The eating and taping on her
The chewing away fingers
Once she feeds me I'm lovin' me tastin' her
Can I just have a normal night?
I just wanna be the man to live normal life
Normal wife, keep her in the formal white
But the psycho creature with the horn will bite
It's almost sun up now
I'm getting done up, wow!
Fellatio! But I found out she was insatiable
She wanted me to do her too
Don't want to see me through her view
'Cause I got on my knees and started doin' my deed
But then I accidentally chewed her through

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a normal boy
Just wanna be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
Then she can be my number one
Lady!
I just wanna be a normal boy
Just wanna be a normal boy
If I could be good and just
Keep the women off my tongue
Then she can be my number one
Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady! Lady!
