[Intro] (4X)
He is cold as ice, he is cold as ice (Celcius)

[Verse 1]
Underrated, long awaited, everybody knew me when I made it
They debated, couldn't fade it, niggas even tried to imitate it
Do you really wanna make Nina hit you with one of these killer flows?
Everybody know I got the kinda scripts that'll make a demon catch a cold
Got the money, got the power, 6 hooks wet up in the shower
With the cleaner, Tecca Nina, cold when I'm bustin' at the cowards
When I finish droppin' this freeze out send 'em to the necropolis
Hail to the poppinest with the villains mobbin' is marvelous
When me lay me head in Les Miserables (Killa)
With the backwards tihs I be the god (Zilla)
My zero degrees makin' 'em freeze with love of a millimeter gun
Servants in the back keep bringin' me spoo d's with 151
Hella choices of women, take 'em to the room, drop the semen
Have the little one show 'em how to power bomb demons
My flow'll find the temper in you, whimper in you
I'm too cold so don't even bother takin' my temperature, nigga

[Hook]
I am cold as ice
I am cold as ice (Celcius)
He is cold as ice
He is cold as ice (Celcius)
Freeze me with your (?)
Ice, ice baby
Freeze me with your (?)
Ice, ice baby

[Verse 2]
Yo the evil's gonna get triple teamed
I freeze demons 'til they brittle ice cold lyrical prodigy
Your life is but a triple beam
Good and bad minions in the middle me and Satan's dichotomy obviously
Nonsmalable cromda lyricombolus, psych!
Thought I'd just speak another language
That Tech N9ne be the strangest
Mr. Freezmizer before the fatality let finish
My slushy like Budweiser you an appetizer
Flowin' off yellin' with a passion, blastin' no time to ration
Everlastin' cashin' a vast stash colder then aspen askin'
Where the real MC's at
Were the competition leavin' all the women soaked like
On a mission to get the punanny wet then it freezes
Which means I'm free from diseases
No melting internal burning no fevers thanking Jesus memen celcius
57 56 never fessed never fold
Brown bandanna on my head lookin' like Eskamo when I roll

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ask my crew if you don't know
Tech will show you the crispy show
Can't fuck with this
(Comin' straight from the abyss)
Zero Celcius, yeah

[Verse 3]
I kicks ass for the cash and I get it, get it
Ain't nobody on the planet fuckin' with it, wit it
I heard you bust that weak ass flow when you did it need to quit it
Know that when the gat spit a rap it's a blizzard don't forget it
I wear my sunglasses at night all haters don't understand (What's that?)
Cause when my gun blasts it's bright cause I can, cause I can (That's right)
Demons tryin' to show me whats sizzilin' think your heated
Leavin' them froze with Nina flows, nigga no need to repeat it
You can't unthaw this flawless, when we rollin' with Rogue Dogs
When they saw we was ballers keepin' haters locked in the closet from all us
Back up off us Me and Juan steppin' off in the night quick
Killin' evil with an icepick
To watch the worms crawl in the worms crawl out
In your stomach and out your mouth, Celcius

[Hook]
