[Intro]
I want you for myself

You might ask yourself, why can't i have this woman?
You might ask yourself, what do i have to do to get this?
[Girl, Girl] x7
Dance all you want baby but just know this...
I want you for myself

[Verse 1]

Girl, i need you, gotta have you
Would never leave you, would get a tattoo
Of your face when i first seen you, you came in a beauty
But strictly business, a princess kickin it with [?]
Sat and watched your boomerang you thrown
Queeny if your homie would see me, he'd changed his tone
Monsters, they don't deserve to be so close and so warm
'till your love power shower me, i sit and hope for your storm
Another beauty, brown proud baby, fine lady
I'm macking you too kay?, like i'm Dracula 2K
Your smile is amazing, your eyes are of gazing now
Man if that was me, you and i would have stayed in back
Laid in the sack, showing you i recognize how you feel (deeply)
About your love, when i seen your life, what a thrill (peep me)
I'm so sincere with this, my eyes say i'm ill
But i ain't got to be no master of disguise, i'm real

[Hook]

I want you for me x3
I want you for myself
I want you for me x3
I want you for myself

[Verse 2]

(chyea) I love your music girl
When i was falling here, when you play it, got me through this world
I ain't lying, you's a dime and i ain't trying to compete
With the other some people want it all but i just want you for me
What i wouldn't give to be that dude at the diner with your clothes jeffin with me
Sunlit smile and low eyes want 'em both reppin' with me
Dreams of us having a night out and you go steppin' with me
That dude you got is a lucky man, most definitely
Another fox, i can get stuck in her eyes
Korben Dallas, he couldn't even measure up to my size
Element 5, i got a place for you
Under my chest, plaqued to you
Know i'd be complete with your loving, i'd be insatiable
Promising you joney, i would never ignore you
Getting your message to the people,i'd be the messenger for you
My resident ain't evil, though they crowned me rhyme killa
Hey we got the same name, they call me 9 milla baby (chyea)

[Hook]

I want you for me x3
I want you for myself
I want you for me x3
I want you for myself

[Verse 3]

Black beauties in rap movies with fat booties
Are really appealing to Nina but i want that cutie
Off in the Bronx with C
I'd be that black that would get jumped off in the hood
Cuz i took his bianca to be
Chocolate glazed make me feel i got to be saved
When you sing to me, it clings to me a lot [?]
[?] is disposable, you need loving, i know you do
Kiss you from your toes to your belly, that's what i'm supposed to do
Last but not least, i wish you was my queen
See thy king get lost in your lips and your high beams
Bad girl, hardcore, exciting's your writing
Caramel honey with icing
Maybe you my soul-mate, maybe i see things
Maybe i've been plotting you since the BIG scene
What i wouldn't give to become your bronze g-string
I want you for me, impatiently waiting for your bee sting (bzzz)

[Hook]

I want you for me x3
I want you for myself
I want you for me x3
I want you for myself

I want you for myself

The End
