[Intro: Tech N9ne & Yukmouth]
Regime killers, ah
What the deal
(It's that lethal)
What's poppin'?
Regime niggas in this motherfucker
For the 199 twist bitch
(Uh, that regime shit)
Regime shit, yeah
(Done deal, bumbell)
New millennium rhymers, nigga
(What, Tecca Nina)
The bumbell, where the fuck you at?
(Up in this bitch)
Uh, what uh, introducin two of the regime's finest
(Regime) Tecca Nina
And Smoke a Lot himself
(Smoke a lot, bumbell)
Let's serve these niggas with the straight shh, uh nigga
(In your back bitch)
Fuck that, I'm tired of not being of the bungalow shit
This bumbell for you, nigga

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
It's bumbell, bumbell, that's straight rapid fire
That override your amplifiers and the woofers
Your bass tube hook ups shut the fuck up with wires cooked up
Niggas stash my tape like gats in the bushes, it's that lethal
It'll probably have you killing people, for real
Cops say it's illegal to have a Yuk tape in your possession
Niggas keep going to jail for 11, 350's and 211's
187's, concealed weapons, all the above
Tear the fuckin' club up with my nigga what

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
That Tech N9ne nigga, lyrically blind niggas on the grind
All the time you will find I spiritually define nigga
Rhyme killer, I'm the fuhrer from Missour-a
Quick when I rip shit trip this animalistic, fuck Ace Ventura
By the power of my dead niggas, I'mma ride this like a rollercoaster
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my niggas I'm the killer representin' Cosa Nostra
So bust like you're supposed to, we guaranteed
This gon' sell, cause this shit's the bumbell nigga

[Hook: Tech N9ne] (2X)
(Ba-bum) This shit is heated
(Ba-bum) Your shit's deleted
(Ba-bum) And when you need it
(Ba-bum) We drunk and weeded
As long as this rap shit sells
Us niggas with figures
We keep releasin' the bumbell

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Bitch I can make you ven (Ba-bum) make you land (Ba-bum)
Make the fans (Ba-bum) gang related dance (Ba-bum)
I can make the hood (Ba-bum) make your Kim Wood (Ba-bum)
Make your stereo (Ba-bum) make calico (Ba-bum)
They dumpin' on us, clunk-clunk go the trunk
Grab the pump, bang my shit when you in the mist to funk
Or get shit crunked, when shit jumps
I'm the theme music like Thorazine
The fiends cling to it, I didn't mean to do it
The music made me do it, it made me loose it
Got my mind playin' tricks, now my nine can't stop
Sprayin' shit, until the nigga lay in a ditch
And when I played this shit it blew my speakers out
Looked out the window I saw dope fiends and tweakers
Out in the middle of the street doing the electric slide
You should have peeped it out
It got me geeked out, hustlin' makin' scriller
After every word I got to say nigga
Like what's up, nigga? Let's smoke this blunt, nigga
Oh, yesterday got caught, got fucked up, nigga
You bumpin' Yuk, nigga? Oh that's the bumbell

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
We're now listening to the sounds of Tech N9ne
I don't need no medication, I just packs my crispy flows
Endo, rum and fornication, jammed up for y'all filthy hoes
That nigga named Tech N9ne is a motherfucker on Gang Related
Hater's gotta respect mine or the next time get strangulated
Rap A Lot summoned me, I told 'em that I had a gun in me
Loony as a nigga wanna be, kindly get the fuck from front of me
Sleepin' with a black cat in my lap, splitin' poles daily
Under a lot of weight and on a bus on a broken mirror don't faze me
They say "Tech without rap you wouldn't be alive"
Fuck that, I got niggas lettin' 'em go for twelve five, bumbell's live
We bringin' heat to the game, deep when we came
Niggas fucked up and put they feet to the flame
Got that (Ish) if you want it, gives a (Iff) I'm a flaunt it
That (Haaaa) got niggas thinkin' I'm hunted, the bumbell

[Hook] (2X)

[Outro: Tech N9ne & Yukmouth]
Yeah (Live and direct)
KC meets Oakland
Oakland meets Houston, a killer mixture
(Bumbell) Bumbell (What)
Tech N9ne (Regime shit)
Ish, uck, nigga
What you wanna do
Regime crew
Like that nigga
Me and Yukmouth up in this motherfucker
Puttin' this shit in your back
For the 199 twist
You know what I'm shizzlin'?
You know what I'm shizzlin'?
You know what I'm shizzlin'?
Regime killers!
(Thugged out, Yukmouth)
