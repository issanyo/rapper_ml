Frozen Image had connections with a group from our city called uh Lo-Key who were signed to Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. And that's how I got my deal with Jimmy Jam and Terry in 1993. Got released from that in '95, started working with Midwestside Records in '96. That got me a deal with Quincy Jones in '97. Moved to LA that summer, came back to KC in '98. Started doing music with my childhood homies 57 RDV's. Started doing shows with them in our area like LU Homecoming and venturing out to Top City, then Denver and Dallas. Met Trav in '99, started doing Strange Music in 2000. Released Anghellic that year, and it spread like crazy. We started doing hella shows in our city, and surrounding cities
