[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Had a shindig everybody in mi casa
When I was approached by a lady trying to blend me proper
When she asked if I really was the king of the choppers
Bitch, I'm Mufasa

[Hook: Brandoshis]
Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Aye
With this bimbo, hit this indo
Said she wanna give me hella vicious then go
'Bout to make the music crescendo
So don't nobody hear me knock it out with the quickness Kimbo
So I had to get the bitch's info
The top was mental, lovely ladies suck it, stay silento
Resemble monkey wrench though
I don't need your credentials
We men though
Leave you in light and leave you in limbo
She chose
N9ne I'm impossible to figure and decode
She wanna really welcome me to the freak show
She fuck with the homies, Sav Siccness and Bleezo
She said that both of my homies they gave her the heave ho
But she ain't never had me killin' it befo'
So I gave her the meat and it was more than Rodigo
She coming to every blur party we throw
(Tim Tebow)
Fakers be oozing illusions
They said they banging; but they moving and grooving
That's why the ladies want the dude with the fusion
Of indica oil and Keith who'd'n and coolin'
Stuffed and puffed like a Cuban
You trippin', she left with us
You get bruised and contusions
Used and abused and fooled
Cos' Tecca N9na, she choosin'

[Hook: Brandoshis]
Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Aye
Choosin' me because I make a knot
Wanna eat my dick up like a brat
They niggas hope that Tecca Nina rot
They never close enough to get a shot
'Cause I be chilling way up at the top
But we never too comfortable and thinking it won't pop
You can bet that the heaters on my family stay cocked
And my governors ready for the petty who said he hot
'Cause I beat, beat, beat, beat, beat her
With the d and not D Jeter
Then I found out she a queef skeeter
When I mixed OJ with the Beef-eater
Your girly's punani it was a deep greeter
Coming at me you'll be a hit by the peace bleeder
I'm a beast I beat beep and she's cheater
She want me in her mouth, I will at least feed her
You know the rules of the game
Your bitch just chose me
We can handle this like we got some class or
Get into the gangster shit if you tripping low-key
Women is never nothing to steal
When you making hella bread and you go from here to Brazil
So you gotta know I'm the nigga that she wanna get to for big thrills for real

[Hook: Brandoshis]
Let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
'Cause I see you choosing
You know I hold it down
Even though I came a long way from the blocks
Still wave my finger to the cops
I see you like what I got
So let me know if you rolling
Let me know if you down
I see you choosing
