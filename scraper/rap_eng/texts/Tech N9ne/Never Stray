[Intro: Tech N9ne & Navé Monjo]
Oh yeah, yeah
Navé Monjo (ooh)
I got on this path like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm gonna one day soon be the best at rap like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But did I lose lots when some people in my life didn't act right? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now when I rock, every show I see the venue be packed like (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nueve

[Pre-Chorus: Navé Monjo]
I've been down that road and I've been thinkin' lately
Through it all I made it through the pain, yeah (ayy)
I been rockin' for a minute, think I'm crazy
But they'll never catch me outta line

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, strange at birth
Born to make a difference when I came to Earth
But Mama never warned me 'bout the pain, the hurt
In the heart and the brain when the game flames ya church
Why do they make road blocks, when the flow's hot?
They said, my music will never fit in the pro slot
Probably why I sell out the cities when I globe trot
Now my wall of records are in platinum and gold box
(Platinum and gold box, platinum and gold box
Platinum and gold box, platinum and gold box)
The game can't kill a nigga ego
When they want it from a hundred to zero
I know the man's plot bury take a below
But you can't block Curry at the free throw
Look how Strange came in the game like Deebo
In the beginning, we did a show in a gazebo
Now we got hits and takin' pics with the people
But they won't play me if I don't mix with the Migos
If you tell me that my music didn't fit they program (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said, that the music I make wasn't fit for the broham (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now do they wanna hear Ninna bussin' over this slow jam? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And now is the motto of Strange, we takin' no shit from no man (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nueve

[Pre-Chorus: Navé Monjo]
I've been down that road and I've been thinkin' lately
Through it all I made it through the pain, yeah (ayy)
I been rockin' for a minute, think I'm crazy, but they'll never catch me outta line

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)
'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, I've been down that road
At the crib, checkin' out every sound that sold
'Til I found that soul of a clown that flows
Then it got her to slither and spin around that pole
So many haters were tryna drown Tech's rolls
And stoppin' him from blossomin' nigga, now that grows
No blockin' him, lockin' them wit' a frown that froze
When he bossin' then he lost 'em when the underground let go
They wanted to hold down Tech's blow
But people ain't keepin', they chiefin' a pound that's Dro
Even seepin' around Death Row
Increasin' my releasin' to many towns, that's dough
But some people wanna delay the bag
Even though you kill everything when you display the gas
Spray the mag, Ninna blast like a laser tag
To who paid the cash, thinkin' I'ma stray the path
Ay, did they doubt me often? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now when they talk about Tech, will they all take caution? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
For the price of fame and what you gain, is it worth what it's costin'? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Am I gonna be the real deal still 'til I'm laid in the coffin? (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nueve

[Pre-Chorus: Navé Monjo]
I've been down that road and I've been thinkin' lately
Through it all I made it through the pain, yeah (ayy)
I been rockin' for a minute, think I'm crazy
But they'll never catch me outta line

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]
'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)
'Cause I'm on a straightaway, I'll never stray away (no)

[Outro: Nave Monjo]
I'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away
I'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away
I'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away
I'm on that straightaway (yeah), I'll never stray away
