[Intro: Tech N9ne]
All of us should go and nigga knock who's wit' it?
They will never know or never stop who did it
'Cause we all speedom up
Ain't no catchin' up with us at all when we cut
Everybody know the way I rip it sound stunnin'
Nobody stoppin' us when we hit the ground runnin'
Come on!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne &  JL]
Feeding you N9na ever since the money was allocated
From T.O.G. and every time I drop people salivated
Venomous vernacular is very vicious and validated
By many people but to the fucking foolish my style is hated
Ain't that a panini that's mad at a weenie
The stabbin' and jabbin' rap and cappin' as bad as cabrini?
I'm one of the critical ones fiendin' for fire foul and formidable from pitiful slums
But I got up and served these suckas my syllables some
Roadrunna this mo gunna's a flow stunna when he get chose by The ho's none of the clothes on her lovin' this soul of a rogue and They want the dough from a platinum and gold negro under one O's number
I'm hand pickin' 'em clarity and the quick in 'em
Stick with the fam, thicker than rarity, never did for them
A chariot with it flickering, flame I hold like Olympian
But a kicker been, I really can't tell if anyone's even listening

[Chorus: King Iso]
I'm not human
Earth is too dense
I don't really wanna be a part of this system, no nothing
Manifest a better place for me, this one malfunctions
Taking off into the universe, I gotta dismount off something
Throw another fuckin' planet toward 'em
'Bout to hit the ground running like

[Verse 2: JL & King Iso]
Tell me I ain't got it, you fakin', lyin', hallucinatin'
You get a vibe but do hide your feelings
You're trying to escape 'em
To the rudimentary it's too Da Vinci for you to take in
Hoping that if I do fall eventually parachute gon' cave-in
Foolish envy with whom am I miscommunicatin' (uh)
Claiming like I ain't one of the illest, you get a rude awakening
Seen this side of me  and then sat in silence recuperating
If you looking to do some hating, figure no use in waiting
I'm forward important spoils of my sport
Cyborg at war winning willing to die for it
On my Thor shit, floor spins spin in a time warp
My portions short then I kill and fill my fork (hell yeah!)
Table tippin', the energy got the cable glitchin'
Enter the matrix when I'm blazing, bitch I be Agent Smith
And shit go shifting back and forth over, it ain't no game of tennis
Taking human form when I'm morphing homie like wait a minute

[Chorus: King Iso]
I'm not human
Earth is too dense
I don't really wanna be a part of this system, no nothing
Manifest a better place for me, this one malfunctions
Taking off into the universe, I gotta dismount off something
Throw another fuckin' planet toward 'em
'Bout to hit the ground running like

[Verse 3: King Iso]
Running like Naruto and needing N9na to throw batons
Baton like Rouge and kill everything like Rittz while foes are on
See you people are slowin' on, we be speedin' like motocross
Please believe it like Ripley, I'm gunnin' like when you quote it wrong
Rockin' o's like I'm Jovi Bon
Got the force, call me Solo Han
I'm the war to you whores, I'm the dinosaur steppin' on your lawn
Anybody wanna try to keep up with the killer
"I don't even want him", gone
Sick enough to go toe to toe with a crook, someone calling ya
"And that nigga's from Omaha?"
Told you all that Iso's a god, bitch it is like I switched dimensions and photo bombed Kotal Kahn
Holy moly, what's goin' on?
With a bat leave 'em Mortal Kom
Open portals when I flow and producers call me Polow da Don
Tech finna soundin' effortless, rhymin' better than most of y'all
You're like Desiigner yes, I be flyer even when clothes are off
Who do I catch now, gotta catch 'em all like a pokeball
Better follow the protocol, listen homie I told you all that

[Chorus: King Iso]
I'm not human
Earth is too dense
I don't really wanna be a part of this system, no nothing
Manifest a better place for me, this one malfunctions
Taking off into the universe, I gotta dismount off something
Throw another fuckin' planet toward 'em
'Bout to hit the ground running like
