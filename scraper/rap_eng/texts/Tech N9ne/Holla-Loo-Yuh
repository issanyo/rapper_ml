[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am everything you ever were afraid of
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
Yeah, you rappers bore me, I wanna kill you
Do it for me and I'll holla-holla

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I am the pinnacle of sin, it shows when he begin his flows
Timid women show genitals, then it's "go" when it's presentable
Finna show women some in this moment diminish whores
Skin it, no gimmicks, replenish, no - grim No Limit shows
Call it what you want it
Middle finger my opponent, really seem defiant, don't it
One moment, I will demolish niggas with the rawest scriptures
Y'all is just balls of shit in a stall, let's hit, this be the hardest pisser
Then a tramp will tell me, my piss enhance her belly
But I chose to give her a dirty mouth like Lisa Lampanelli
Yes, she demanded jelly, but I re-ran the Kelly
I'm springing the yelly and it's swell because I slammed the Belvy
I'm a monster, on the mic or when I'm on her
Have a motherfucker somber, 'cause of ill shit that I conjure
Juggernaut, he never conquered, if she wants for me, I haunt her
Wondering where we've gone, sir R.A. and Tech, yeah we bonkers

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am everything you ever were afraid of
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
Yeah, you rappers bore me, I wanna kill you
Do it for me and I'll holla-holla

[Verse 2: R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo, it's a brutal system, assume position
You superstition? Or Jew or Christian?
School religion is a cruel depiction
They can blind your hearing, they can mute your vision
Live in the dirt, burn, slithering earth worm
Leave you like MJ with a hit and a burnt perm
Soon to be unity, murder me, what could you do to me?
This is foolery, I'm a hooligan, leaving you drooling
When I'm beating you brutally, slappin' your bitch and takin' your jewelry
Your mama crying when she reading your eulogy
Let me slow down, put your dough down
I've got enough flow for it to go 'round
This is profound, you a broke clown
With a coke frown and an old sound
I'm like "sell 'em the heroin and givin' 'em the needle"
I'm in your cerebral, this wigger is evil
Limit the people, piss in a cathedral
Aborting your mission like a position that's fetal
My impolite stares give 'em nightmares
Burn 'em like the bush, give 'em white hairs
Jiving and shucking your ass, sufferin' succotash
I fuck with the gutter trash, don't fuck with the upper class
Sellers and buyers, political liars
The drug suppliers, the fake Messiahs
Is it negative energy hiding their identity?
Every enemy wishing they were shooting me like a Kennedy
I spit at Satan and I kick his face in
Make him lick the pavement for misbehaving
You got a vendetta? Better be ready to forget it
Bullets is headed to your head and embedded, the slug met it
I be tripping on my ego like I'm Ultra Magnetic
I'm makin' dollars like I'm Parrish and Erick
I'm back, check it bitch

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]

I am rap's big swinging ding-a-ling, make 'em sing
(Holla-holla-loo-yuh)
Yeah, you rappers bore me, I wanna kill you
Do it for me and I'll holla-holla
