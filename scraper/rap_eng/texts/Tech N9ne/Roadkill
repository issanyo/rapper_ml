[Intro: Excision/Tech N9ne]
I need Energy! Energy! Energy!...
(Energy, energy, energy...)
Choose your weapon
Send whatever you do in life to hell or Heaven
No question
Kill it
Like a MAC-11
Or Smith & Wesson
Tech and X and Krizz will make 'em call the reverend

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I kill off everything wit' this
So good you better be bringin' it!
Killin' em cleverly kingin' shit that is so real
I will never be dreamin' this!
Killin' 'em softly no it ain't my lane
Hard is the way I display my pain
I put it on murder the moment they say my name!

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Ooh yeah
I do share
War instilled
I won't spare
I will spill
Those who are not real!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
ROAD KILL!
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
All everyone of you
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
ROAD KILL!
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
All everyone of ya
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
ROAD KILL!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You better be careful when stepping in my circle with evil intentions I dominate
Any competitor etcetera etcetera
I'm comin' out the victor cause I'm the great!
If you continue to come with confusion
Or crazy well I can accommodate
You with this bussin' I'm givin' 'em concussions
I'm totally crushin' cause I'm a Yates
I get the people involved, they want me deep in this brawl
Wish I was reachin' for peace but I am beefin' with ch'all
Breakin' your teeth and your jaw
Labeled a monster when they say that I say danke
Cause the anger I conjure
All the demons we send them, been never up yonder
If you're not evil then what is good on ya?

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Ooh yeah
I do share
War instilled
I won't spare
I will spill
Those who are not real!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
ROAD KILL!
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
All everyone of ya
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
ROAD KILL!
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
All everyone of ya
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill
ROAD KILL!

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
If we fear anything
That'll mean
You're the brain
Lets see what you're made of
Kill everything you're afraid of
ROAD KILL!

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
