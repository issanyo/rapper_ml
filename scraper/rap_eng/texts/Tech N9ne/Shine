[Intro]
(I thought it was love)
Aww yeah?
I feel you JP
Let's go

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Been at the bottom, but then I got them up into this ring
I beat them up because I never been an average
A flick and a swallow and Tecca Nina get up in this thing
Without a flaw, you're gonna wonder what the matter is
I'm packing my bag with C4
I'mma harass, I'mma blast the people
Tryna bury my class in the grass and dig mo'
Said I'mma be last to be bad, to see dough
But I gas the weak flow
The people who bash the freak show, gonna gag when he (GO!)
Mad 'cause he (PRO!)
I need the natural that'll have release, so as soon as the weed grow, just pass the leaf (YO!)
(I thought it was love)
After all my angel blood that they drew
(I thought it was love)
But I won't come quick and seen it wasn't true
I've got my liquorana,  my marijuana, her great punan in my cheeks
Laughing at everybody who dissed the Nina and treated me like a fucking disease

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
You pull your gun and never put no fear in us
'Cause we've been done no worse, no one was hearing us
Are we gonna dust if off and drop a tyran, just
Push the pain, we claimed insane and banged it 'til it was clear enough

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Now the people wanna get involved, 'cause I'm a killer and I meant it when I said it
And never really read the hidden clause that I'mma bill it when I spit it, I'mma shred it
Never be nothing that's gonna keep me down
I get to busting, I'm gonna heat this ground
I'm thinking back in the day, when I spit with the best in the business, they was jealous, so want to beat me down
Everybody know it's hard to shine in the gutter
But I got up and pushed the line, 'cause I'm a thugger
Was a second away from going under
Room for bum to boy wonder
Passed the days when they threw the shade
They all looked amazed, 'cause I brung the thunder

[Hook]
Yeah, hell yeah, yeah
Are you hopelessly alone, when they catch you in the dark?
You know we hardly shine in the gutter
You're hopelessly alone and now they drag you down
You know we hardly shine in the gutter

[Outro]
I still pray for you
I still pray for you
I still pray for you
