[Intro]
And God said let us make man in our image (Tech)
According to our likeness (N9ne)
Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea
Over birds of the air, over the cattle, and over all the earth

[Verse 1]
Projected image across my soul saying can't (Die)
Many death situations but that ain't (Why)
I got the spirit of an angel mixed with demoniac ways of livin'
So this means I'll beat the evil out of a non-believer until praise is given
(But I know)
Torture is evil though it says in the (Bible)
You got to be righteous spirited for the (Arrival)
I'm righteous and wicked but I wonder (Can I go)
If there's a heaven but on earth it's (Survival)
Connected with angels but to demons (I'm vital)
Approachin' with hate oh yes it's (Homicidal)
Like denouncing Selena at (Cinco de Mayo)
Certain death (Oh no) Oh no
I'm on the road to heaven and hell
Don't even bother me ever since eleven and twelve
I've been that prodigy though life has never been swell
Somewhere there's gotta be where a good Samaritan prevails
But they get straight sodomy
So I learned the ways of man
Grands
Fillin my pants
Gun in my hand
For the demons on the land
On the other hand I really am
An-ghellic
I ain't got to stress if you can't tell it
Look into my eyes
No surprise
I'm half cupid, half relic (Cha cha)
He who treads the path of the beast is also he who sins are repentable
But if you ever, ever ever ever heard of God then we gotta do away with the genitals
Don't ever do somethin' you'll regret
Do away with all these goody goody law abiding mothafuckas and let there be Tech nigga

[Hook 1]
If anybody say "Fuck me"
Everybody say "Fuck you"
'Cause they know my shit's pure
Soul serving and plus true
If anybody say "Fuck me"
Everybody say "Fuck you"
Odd one Tech got that God Complex

[Hook 2 ] 2x
Get on your knees and pray
If you step in our way
'Cause we spray 'til they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long? (Must we flash and pop)
How long? (Must we show demons we can't be stopped)

[Verse 2]
(Can they fuck wit' chu?) No
(Their brain frames are too) Slow
(The villain will kill 'em with new) Flow
(If ya hatin' me this is for you) Blow
I've been too humble wit' y'all niggas
Time to rumble wit' y'all niggas
Me and Don Juan forever we gettin' figures
Me and the Rogue Dogs are kickin' it gettin' richer
All these fools thinkin' they gonna stop me
I'm about to make us a million just watch me
Everybody thinkin' they heated but they sloppy
Nigga, that's why you never be sellin' copies
(I will) Rise above all of you regardless of (My skrill)
That ain't got shit to do with Tecca the (N9ne skill)
Bust on you rapper cats and proceed to (Make mill 5-6 Vill)
I be seein' 'em down at Mardi Gras gettin' flows off
Everything gettin' showed off
Not me, tryin' to mock me on record head gettin' blowed off
Freestyle I admire
But every week you givin' away fire
Your rappers license expired
Leavin' nothin' to be desired
Oh God bless this particular rapper in K.C
No matter how hard you try, you can't fuck with me
First, learn how to do choruses then try to get people to trust you
If anybody say "Fuck me" everybody say "Fuck you"

[Hook 2] 2x
Get on your knees and pray
If you step in our way
'Cause we spray 'til they decay
The ones who hate everyday
But how long? (Must we flash and pop)
How long? (Must we show demons we can't be stopped)

[Verse 3]
If I offended you in any way (Maybe the shoe fits)
Either that or you just plenty gay (If you like me)
You don't give a damn you're just enjoyin' the flow
To all the people who were offended
I'm about to offend you some mo'
Is God
White, brown, green, red, or even blue?
Is he American, Arabic, Mexican, or even Jew?
Everybody wanna be the special and wanna be the chosen few
Everybody wanna be but they gonna be through
'Til you do right by me, everything that you do is gon' be wack
Everything you built is 'bout to crack
Everything you did to me is comin' back
No where to scat
And I say that
'Cause I know Jesus Christ and God is black
And they comin' back nigga!
Jeah! Nigga
Like I said, me and Don Juan
Best motherfuckin' rapper, best motherfuckin' producer
Globally, in Kansas City wherever nigga
And all y'all haters, remember this!
