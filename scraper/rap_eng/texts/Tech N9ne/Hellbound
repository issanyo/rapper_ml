[Intro]
God look over me
God forgive for my cabalism and my metabolism and my iniquitous delivery
The righteous shall prosper
But the vile you'll get some
Banefullness and evil times right back at you the [?]

[Verse 1]
The Kraken is about to be unleashed
So everybody with a soul best peep the beats
I try to be lovin' [?]
A part of me gotta be fucking or smoking a leaf
Thought about cummin' on your sheets with your girl, in your world
Evil tendencys in me makes me wanna turn a holesom bitch into a show girl
God told me I was sinning in the bathroom with satan masturbating but I was thinkin' about my wife and ain't no other bitch
So I'mma gonna jerk my dick until it spits
But as I analyze my little episodes of my opposite [?]
Turns out I wasn't worshipping god cause I was worshipping clitorises
Like this, we've lost a brotha named Zkeircrow
Cause the way I hung with his chick was sick
Now I'm off up in the rock pick watching her touch her self I like jack my dick and I wonder why my life stay raggedy niggas dream of baggin' me buckin' loads can tell you I was stupid and Dynomack was hurt when he found out that I fucked Agginy
See lust in my eyes, Jesus been alive, in my life of marriage but I don't want the demon in me taking over me and making the love we got parish the wife deserves a better nigga instead of a motherfucker that keeps a lockdown tight and held down
May god have mercy on my soul cause I know that I'm hellbound

[Verse 2]
I be looking like a motherfucking idiot
I be living like a motherfucking idiot
I be feeling like a motherfuckin idiot
Those who on stuck in Kansas City shit
I wanna be alone, so I can ride
Just me and my soul, that ain't gonna dry
In the midst of a crisis, yes Nick Jones
He rang my phone, still ain't no knot in my pocket
Please stop it, thinks she knows that niggas like us don't make it in [?]
Niggas like us get passed up when your like one of the best nigga carlos
Situations make you wanna peel somebody see a nigga for real become naughty
So, maybe, I should jump behind the wheels and let my petit mal seizures kill somebody
Dyamund Shields, blessing soul, givin' me skrill, for every scroll
But I can't depend on he, to keep me right while keeping this daycare tight
He is not fucking up my family, but me is fucking up my family
Sittin' around broke as a joke tryin to depend on he
Sometimes when it's thundering I start wondering about my quick [?]
Gift that I got, is a god giving a remedeous to son of asmodeus
Exodus insanus nocturnus
Jesus can't stand us, hot burners
And you wonder why we don't like churches
Generation X stay away on purpose
I only speak for the few not you
Only for those with the beast within
That's the whole motherfucking human race straight written on your face its the S-I-N
So let me end my soliloquy, through, feelin' me
So I'mma end this with a bang
I wanna fuck your bitch
My music ain't shit
Gonna slit my neck and feel flame
Cause I'm hellbound

[Verse 3]
Where am I?
Some where far far away like you requested
What happened?
Deep in the wrathful game of death you've been selected
Who are you?
Me I'm an angel I run this wonderful place
Well I be the one them called Tech N9ne (Tech N9ne)
Representing the human race
Thee human race (That's right)
The race that hold the souls (Yeah)
Where you been summoned to serve eternal life because your soul was cold now it unfolds
That I been called to bring you hell repeatedly take a look around
You humans are so fucking predictable cause for hell you were bound
