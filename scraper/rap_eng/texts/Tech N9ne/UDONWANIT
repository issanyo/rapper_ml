[Intro: Trick Trick]
Fuck is this about? Huh?
Fuck you mean you ain't know?
Ain't nobody told you!
Somebody have to tell you something!
Motherfucker don't act like you ain't know! Asshole!

[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
You know they fuck with an OG, I do this for real
And I don't need no liquor, lean, and ain't doin' no pills
I don't need your little production company, ain't doin' no thrills
Show you what niggas of my caliber do for that skrill
I been away for a minute shootin' them movies and reels
Quietly back in the trenches, hustlin' and provin' my skill
After that spot at the top, like you assumin' I will
Keepin' them haters where they belong, up under my heel
Who else you know in this shit thats really the true of that steel?
Who else been givin' you something that you can truthfully feel?
It's like N.W.A. with they saying "I'm Ruthless for real"
Unrecognizable to these niggas thats new to the field
I say the terror continue 'til the truth is revealed
And I won't stop until everybody in the crew got a mil
I'm on that Outlaw shit, so I'm refusin' to chill
And got your folks tryna figure out what you do to get killed
(Fucker)

[Hook: Trick Trick]
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?

[Verse 2: Diezel]
Woke up to the Wild Wild West (West)
Bullets fly, you can die in a heartbeat
If your heart speak, bitch
Say it with your chest
The weak shit fall on deaf ears
Real tattoo cheers without tattoo tears
Careful round here
Or you will be marked as a target and off to the Lord (Woo!)
The demon of murder is in the motherfuckin' air
So keep your burner cause it can happen anywhere
These slugs is anonymous, flyin' through the city
And blood what it promises
All kind Tech, watch that ho bleed
Smell that flesh cook
Stalk that light bean
This how death look
Look him in his face, make him understand
Why the fuck should you deserve another chance? (Naw)
You don't, with time tickin' on the clock does stop
Time to suit him up and put him in that box (Motherfucker)

[Hook: Trick Trick]
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
One word, from curs
Anymore they'll be dung stirred
Some served, run scared
It'll be nothin' but guns heard
Concurred, by killas
Young nerds try 'til a
Nigga brung verbs la millas
On tongues slurred, I pilla
Weak songbird I feel a
Block of stone at your feet
Only the strong will live long
Or get the chrome at your beak
The moment when you want it
Then it's on, get ya gone, hella foam at the teeth
Of all my niggas all I gotta do is speak a couple of words
Nigga, bon app√©tit
Rappers talk shit behind microphones
But you know they havin' it really nice at home
Go to my city they gonna knife his prone
To penetrate a devil until the life is gone!
He jokin'
Lots of disrespect was spoken
Gotta admit that Tech was coachin'
You but you dissed and let this open
Mean shit nigga!
Is being rich niggas, are green
With ditch diggers to get you greenlit, nigga!
I wish I was a good sport, and passive
But I'm absolutely an asshole, and actually, active!

[Hook: Trick Trick]
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?
I don't think you niggas really want it with me
Ain't nobody tell you? Nigga udonwanit with me
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' gangster, hustler, outlaw
All raw, uncut, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?
