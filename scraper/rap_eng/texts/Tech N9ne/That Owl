[Verse 1]
He wild out his style 'bout a mile out ahead of
You foul outs who owl out he's now 'bout freshetta
So bow out his roud out ya gow house and bedda
In ya gow mout he plowed out and now 'bout to shredda
He stridded them thidown way overseas with his didiplomatic community
The thizzled was nizzled for chakratease when he trid it the bladda community
Way out, all that don't know stay out
Along with the won't nose they bout
What's in it's nothing don't know bump from busting
On stage he captivates, all the hate deactivates
For laughter sake he has to make ya batch collapse and masturbate
Snatch the quake ya facts to break, after 8 she's at the gate
Crap for making that mistake she make the splat evaporate

[Bridge]
Got one of the hardest flows
Can give you that flawless show
Strange collects all his dough
Baby you just don't know

[Verse 2]
Who does like to scoot in groups and shoot the youth it's cute to you
But it won't be such a hoot when he's so whoopdy woop the truth get through
Who did you expect to rip and collect checks
Next best bet is to respect the TECH TECH

[Hook]
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Who is that who is he (gon' let it fly)
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Where'd it go lemme see (open your eyes)
That owl, that owl, that owl, Tech N9ne!
That owl, that owl, Tech Tech

[Verse 3]
Wait, listen
Don't talk about what you don't know
If you don't know shut your mouth
He's into rock and roll, if you trip he lock and load
Ya spit is thoughts in vogue, least as far as rhompin' go
Flee with your softened flow, some of you idiots be talking code
When you get up on the mic and you end up in a coffin froze
Gawkin' hoes in Berlin know, he's a hoi dish maker
Try to keep it straight universal like toilet paper
It's strictly Kama Sutra, we poking again
Now young ladies they really wanna sutte mig in Copenhagen

[Bridge]
Got one of the hardest flows
Can give you that flawless show
Strange collects all his dough
Baby you just don't know

[Verse 4]
Seven-Nine is a head of time, with this head of mine I can get a rhyme
With this better fine hella shining, better dimes than Kevin Federline
Or Michael Ealy, I don't know about that 'cause he might go sceely
When he find out when the Tech drop and then pop his chick gon' feel me

[Hook]
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Who is that who is he (gon' let it fly)
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Where'd it go lemme see (open your eyes)
That owl, that owl, that owl, Tech N9ne!
That owl, that owl, Tech Tech

[Verse 5]
He he he he heh
Don't talk about what you don't know
If you don't know shut your mouth
You're not supposed to say (who), that's what most today (do)
When they know the way (you), blow these folks away (true)
Irreparable damage, you vegetables managed
To get up in the light and vent in your glam, it's a pitiful shame with the best of these damn hits
And I'm talking to you, if you coughing up who
If you lost get a view, off in Mizzou, costed a few
Lives when you think better dead it, lies what you hate hella wet it
Keep it copacetic, if you coming knuckle headed
Then you better get a medic
Gimme the benefit I'ma give you the itty bit when I rip it I really know what to do
Vivid I'm a livid lover, knowing I'ma bust spittin' over this record, I'm about to flirt with Caribou
Back to back that's nada the crack
Back when ya master that (brr brr) outta the blue
Gimme the money universally and I bet that you're gonna wanna be one of my hunnies when I get through (ooh)
I'm one you should mock, just like you would 'Pac
I'm banging loud taming crowds big as Woodstock
We keep a good Glock, not the ones who stood shocked
Or the ones that say who 'cause they truly neighborhood watch

[Hook]
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Who is that who is he (gon' let it fly)
Who that is who that be (come on with it)
Where'd it go lemme see (open your eyes)
That owl, that owl, that owl, Tech N9ne!
That owl, that owl, Tech Tech
