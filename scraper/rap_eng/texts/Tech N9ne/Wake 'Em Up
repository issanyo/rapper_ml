[Intro: Tech N9ne]
E-A-Ski, yeah
Haha, Tech N9ne
They see all the shit we got man
They see all the cars we got
They see all the fans we got
They see all the money we got
And they seem to think that's all we gon' get
But you know there's gotta be something better out there
More money for us, we have to get more, ya feel me?

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yo I got cabbage
Living it lavish with me and Travis collabing at the snake and bat as a savage
Meaning Strange Music is the baddest
Here we got fanatics, that'll ravish me, grabbing me, when they see me they do acrobatics
Tech N9ne em, some be like nevermind em
But I blind em with clarity when they stare at me find gems
I'm him, the one that'll step up to remind them
Brotha Lynch automatically shinin' when we signed him
Still, some think I've reached my peak and I'm seeking peace
Never that, bust like I'm deep in beef
And I’m never gonna let the reaping cease
When I put my key in my
Mercedes I'm seeing high
Numbers with wonders like strange music
And IMGMI
E-A-Ski, why these haters wanna debate  we
The great, they see we ate
But I want more papes, so baby pay me
If you sleeping it's wakey wakey
Mothafucka we straight see
Something better for the chedda, we crazy

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
I know I can do something better
Steady scheming to get mo' chedda
Even if I wake em up with my Beretta
Whatever endeavor, I'm gon' do better

[Verse 2: E-A-Ski]
Woke up wrong side of the bed
Now I’m committing homicide with the lead
Fowing like cyanide to the the head
Killing em with the beats, that's half of the bread
No credit, you see me ball
I need it all, I said it
Keep talking bout it, I could rap about it all day all night
You choppin' it, that no bullshit
I come clap with it it, I could make yo girl going wild, go sellin' it
Hate all you want to, its irrelevant
The E in E-A, its for ex-e-e-e-execute, exterminate
You're hors d'oeuvre on a serving plate
You'll get served à la carte
And watch my name reverberate
There go E-A-Ski again
On the radio new hit again
Another video you can see me in
Mad cause I don't wanna be your friend
I break bread with niggas like, Tech N9ne with triggas like
Blaow blaow nigga hold that
Cold like rigor mortis right
I go hard, marble top
Neighborhood watch wanna call the cop
9-1-1 is a joke to me
Flavor Flav, Chuck D
Call me OG Mr. Skee
Original Public Enemy
Wake you up with this 223, and put yo punk ass back to sleep

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
I know I can do something better
Steady scheming to get mo' chedda
Even if I wake em up with my Beretta
Whatever endeavor, I'm gon' do better

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I don’t know why you front
You could have anything and everything you want
Get rich, is about time you switch
Stop wearing fake jewelry, and lying to your bitch
It’s always on ya brain, more than anything
Ever since your hustle went bad, you ain't been the same
It's time to reinvent
Roll up on the next bitch you see and pimp
Make sure you tell her, it's all about you
Everything's a ho to me, that's how I do it
If life was one pimp and one prostitute
Just put the bitch to work, that's all you gotta do
And now the money don't stop mane
It ain't hard, you could run the same game
Fuck being broke, I can't take this shit
Just sing along to the song and it'll make you rich

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
I know I can do something better
Steady scheming to get mo' chedda
Even if I wake em up with my Beretta
Whatever endeavor, I'm gon' do better
