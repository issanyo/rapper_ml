[Intro]
Slacker: a person who shirks his work or duty; a person who evades military service in wartime... hahahahaha! I know one thing, man. I'm gonna have my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames. You know what I'm saying? Hahahaha! Eat, drink, and be merry. Tomorrow you may die. That's what life's about, man. Good times, noodle salad. Haha...

[Verse 1]
I'm a product of Reaganomics
Neurotic, they saying I'm it
Just got up, inhaling chronic
The oddest, I'm staying honest
I'm 'bout to make it famous
So you can take that J-O-B and you can shove it up your anus
I ain't never understood how the world works
But I always understood why the girls twerk
For a baller, not a 9-to-5
Barely making it with disgust behind your eyes
So I just grip my piece, rip-off fleece
Out to take your lip off, chief with my peeps
We ruthless, if you got money induce it
Goofs get toothless, we loose off two-fifths, we useless
I wanna kick it but ain't got the dough
Sneak in the concert, trip, and make 'em stop the show
We gots to go! Push me and I sock the po'
Gettin' the bail from my parents is impossible

[Hook]
(I'm a slacker) Never did I have a lot of dough
(I'm a slacker) Smoking pot and watching videos
(I'm a slacker) Go whichever way the wind blows
Those just tuning in, I'm just letting you know
(I'm a slacker) Every time I take a look around
(I'm a slacker) Stuck upon my face is a frown
I don't do enough, I just fool around
Y'all can go to hell, how does that sound?

[Verse 2]
Now you can tell by my everyday 'fits, I ain't rich
I sneak with a piece when I grit (grit)
I'm just another gatman caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna take yo' dollar and your fifteen cents (I grind with a pistol)
I stay rid of you lames (y'all gay!)
I play video games (all day!)
What Kansas City, MO brangs is a gritty slow game
We diddy-bop with really no change (y'all pay!)
And people holla "How you do that there?
Why your pants hanging low and why you grew that hair?"
Lighting a bleeze with my people riding a Regal
Always in trouble with coppers 'cause we drivin' illegal
I ain't never giving them leeway, to hear me neigh
The judicial assembly's gay (hey!)
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day!
Tryna get with Def Jam, Loud or MCA!

[Hook]
(I'm a slacker) Never did I have a lot of dough
(I'm a slacker) Smoking pot and watching videos
(I'm a slacker) Go whichever way the wind blows
Those just tuning in, I'm just letting you know
(I'm a slacker) Every time I take a look around
(I'm a slacker) Stuck upon my face is a frown
I don't do enough, I just fool around
Y'all can go to hell, how does that sound?

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo, check
Enter the party and my homies got to pay for me
Holidays, them be just be another day for me
Getting drunk, hoping I get to the crib safe-a-ly
Pray for me, 'cause I'm needin' money majorly
Sit at home watching MTV with a empty P-
O-C-K-E-T, I MP3, everything that I hear on the streets
Never buy it, don't deny it, I'm the fear, I'm a beast
You say get a job? I say hit a knob!
'Cause the way you run the world is every bit a fraud
So what you ask of me? You get no tax from me
I got whites, natives and Mexicans and blacks with me
Huh! I'm tryna get up there with Master P
Pass the D, 'cause, that's the way it has to be
We bust to be free, we trust to be G
So fuck who be glee, it sucks to be me

[Hook]
(I'm a slacker) Never did I have a lot of dough
(I'm a slacker) Smoking pot and watching videos
(I'm a slacker) Go whichever way the wind blows
Those just tuning in, I'm just letting you know
(I'm a slacker) Every time I take a look around
(I'm a slacker) Stuck upon my face is a frown
I don't do enough, I just fool around
Y'all can go to hell, how does that sound?
(I'm a slacker) Never did I have a lot of dough

I'm a slacker (doo) I'm a slacker (doo-doo-doo-doo) yeah (doo-o)
