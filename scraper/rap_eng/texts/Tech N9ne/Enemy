[Hook: Prozak] x2
I can see it in your eyes
See right through your lies
Everything you pretend to be
And it comes as no surprise
Hater in disguise
That you are my enemy

[Verse 1: Prozak]
Just look at you, I see you staring all green with envy
You wishin' upon a star hoping, that one day you can end me
Bitch, look deep into my eyes, you don't know truth from lies
And it comes as no surprise, I'm not the kind to empathize
Retaliation (MUST!) annihilation (BUST!)
A violation guaranteed to make your skull crush
A savage assassin, it belongs to a fandom like Manson
Attacking at random by sellin' your soul for ransom
Tall dark and handsome, 300 pounds and then some
I come equipped with 'bout four clip inside of me handgun
And if you really want it with me, then you can have some
But I suggest you listen to the words inside this anthem
So can you back it up, but there's no place you can run
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop, lights camera, action!
In terms of intellect, it's simple that my shit is pure
It makes me wonder how the fuck you got so insecure

[Hook: Prozak] x2
I can see it in your eyes
See right through your lies
Everything you pretend to be
And it comes as no surprise
Hater in disguise
That you are my enemy

[Verse 2: Prozak]
I get it how I live it, I hustle every minute
It's sloppy seconds pick and done 'ready ran up in it
No matter how much you say, it despite them things you do
And keep in mind this cancerous karma comes back to you
I kind of wonder, if you ponder in your slumber
Thoughts of trying to solve your blunders with plots of takin' me under, fag
But you must muster enough strength to stop this thunder
And think before you plunder, you might find yourself in a body bag
I must be doing somethin', I keep you haters talkin'
Meanwhile these bitches gawkin', check out those people moshin'
Been known to keep it poppin', still got these albums droppin'
Despite your player Haitian, I hit the nation nothin'!
Hip-hop the cynical, rock, rap, political
Lyrics so critical, pivot on each and every syllable
Always original traitors cut your umbilical
Imitate or reciprocal emulating my pentacle

[Hook: Prozak] x2
I can see it in your eyes
See right through your lies
Everything you pretend to be
And it comes as no surprise
Hater in disguise
That you are my enemy

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
(Pussy!) I can see you hatin' this
Life I lead when I'm makin' it
Well deserved the seldom words
And I can feel you fakin' bitch
Ain't never no mistakin' with
That demon inside is blatant shit
Like when I come around hating quits
And I smile at a false hand-shakin' bitch
They already told me what you said
Tech is old and the followers dead
Forget his flow and fuck his red
I'd be wrong if I bust your head
Send that punk to the fuckin' meds
How you gonna be jealous about my bread
When it started out with none of us fed
All this time we sweat and bled
And you salty, awfully faulty
With your jeffin' envy
And let your a pals feed off me!
I'm a thirsty killer
And I'm quick to jerk these stealers
And you cannot hurt me skriller
When I think like Percy Miller!
In my vicinity don't pretend to be
A friend of me, 'cause sin is he
Who be grim and diminish me
Like I was Kennedy when it be serenity
I'm finicky about being around you motherfuckers
Cause you're my enemy!

[Hook: Prozak] x2
I can see it in your eyes
See right through your lies
Everything you pretend to be
And it comes as no surprise
Hater in disguise
That you are my enemy
