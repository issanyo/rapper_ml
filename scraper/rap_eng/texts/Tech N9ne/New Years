[Verse 1:]
Sexy should be a felony, she lookin' so damn good
So classy, yet she so damn hood
Uh, and when them bottles get to poppin'
And that smoke gets to smokin', bust this tang wide open
I'm losin' my cool, the way she's movin' in that skirt

And she don't need no push-up bra, shawty already a star
No * *
And I'm guilty of stalkin'

This is a Outlaw party, havin' a toast with my soldierss

We

She makin' me crazy, she got me bustin' out my pants

[Hook]
Make your way to the floor
Take your heels off if they make you move slow

It's goin' down in this bitch, yeah, yeah
We gon' party like it's New Year

[Verse 2:]
Okay, my whip

[Hook]

[Verse: Tech N9ne]
Hennessy, Sprite and lemon in me
Enemy sight me and then it's friendly
* * * * * * * * *
Finna be fights with men and envy
Nothin' but a thang, my staff is rougher
Bad 'cause they half a hustler
Sad that I had to crutch her, stuffed her, then passed her my asthma puffer
True story, a bitch is lookin' for euphoria
Let loose * *, addicted to * a *
She's a fiend, tryin' to give somethin' more than your thing
Stored in your dreams, it's Tech Ninna with * * * *
* like a southpaw, drinkin' like an Outlaw
Party like it's New Year's, hit it, then I'm out, y'all
We hit the town and put it down without stall
Step in the club and make they motherfuckin' mouth fall
Tech N9ne!

[Hook]
