[Intro]
No matter what way the fans receive music
We at Strange Music
Will be right there in it
All those streaming services make it nearly impossible for artist to make some real bread
We will prevail and take over all facets of the music industry

[Hook: Ryan Bradley]
All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Time's up, I'm just
Gonna make it difficult for other rappers to get they rhymes up
N9ne's a mindfuck, I'm the kind to
Design the crime, bury them all in lime, your shine's behind us
Stop, you could do it all day
But you're not gonna pop me the crew and all lay
In the box, you were topping the charts
Look at the people not even jockin' your art
Why's that? 'Cause everybody that really buys rap
Don't wanna listen to any guys yap
Fly! This'll leave you in the sky cap (ahoo!)
Three X, we test the best
Reflect 'cause you're 'bout to go see death
And the killer gonna be Tech, he next
All the people never gonna re-elect such a reject
When I spit vital with this title
You sit idle like Seacrest, we over it

[Hook]
All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Better pray that they want to come see your show
That right there gonna be your dough
You fizzin' out and we want more, we gon' blow
Them all away then haul away
The raw decay then y'all will say "we don't know"
The K.O.D'll spray the fraud away
Make it a holiday, see killin' when he don't flow
Iâ€™m enhanced and polished
All of the women, they wanna dance and frolic
You was a winner with lotta grands in pockets
Now you get rants and audits
We bored wit'cha, quick to hit ya with the war whip
The scripture mister, Forbes lister
Bigger figure from a poor nigga!
A lot of y'all names I could say
If I was evil, I really would Sway
But I was taught to not be no punk
And don't pull no punches, my hood say
But since y'all actin' like Biancas and Beatrices
I should say, your last album was everywhere
And I don't mean that in a good way, we over it

[Hook]
All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
You can rap all you want and sing
But I'm runnin' things
I'm forever, makes you wanna scream
'Cause I'm the one and king

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Don't be devastated due to my dialect
Dummies down declining due to die in debt, die in debt
When you wake and wonder why you wide and wet
Wicked whispers whiskin' away you, why invest? Why invest?
Ain't no competition so get violent
Ain't expectin' nothin' but ya silence, silence
So fly your noggin, I can be the fucking pilot
I know you know my number you can dial it, dial it
You got to know by now that I'm really unstoppable
Try now, you'll be silly in a hospital
Lie down, got the pilly and I lock and load
I'm takin' everything, breakin' everything you'll spit
This ain't nothin' to me, child's play
That's why I'm takin' over this (Bullshit!)

[Hook]
All of us are over it
So we're takin' over it
So cold the shoulder gets
'Cause we're over it, over it
So we're takin' over it
