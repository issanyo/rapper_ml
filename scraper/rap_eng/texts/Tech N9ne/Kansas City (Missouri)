[Intro]
Yes, you've got it, it's the muthafuckin' Pure Dope posse
Can we familiarize that with you niggers?
Comin' up on the mic is the motherfuckin' Philster
Bust that shit G

[Verse 1: The Philsta']
As I enter the perimeter of an Icy Roc production
Comin' The Philsta, I'm [?] without question, I start bustin'
In the audio lyrical tango for the niggas that know that my shit is so dope and I'm coverin' every angle
Pure dynamic, I'm [?] keepin' up
Because you don't even speak the language
Articulation with 'nough [?] is how I bang it
Cover me Fix while I rap [?] that co-sproduced a bombs [?]
Loose on so go on and buy my shit
Down muthafuckas out in Kansas City are next to what I'm stressin'
Yo boy's tape is shitty as a muthafucka
Ayo, the beats is wack, his DJ's a fuckin' joke [?]
The nigga can't even rap so I decided to give him a [?]
And he "soundin' like a punk"
So I said fuck that I can't let him disgrace where I'm from
So we schemed and dreamed and the plan was grand then
Whenever I drop my shit I bet my life is slim
'Cause these niggas is fakes and they ballin' y'all
And that

[Verse 2]
Our things about to turn up on Kansas City down with
This nigga named Bob a.k.a. a wordsmith
A fatherless nigga who always drinks a lot
And plus I'm schemin' and dreamin'
I'm fillin' my pockets with the fat knot
What would I do if Icy Roc had no thing?
As I guess I linger down on the corner with a drum singers
[?] he's blessed with all the shit
So we can make a hit [?] slam on a funky bitch
Don't even trip on a voice, I'm thinking sexy
And hold on to your girl 'cause she wants to get next to me
And for your crew, they won't run up G
You couldn't [?] those muthafuckas and [?] punk ass homie
And for you, I wouldn't even try to bother
Before you be gagged and tied and dropped off in some water
And your DJ, he scratches as if his wrist was twisted
And the rest of your boys - they straight sound like bitches
So if you wanna do me a favour, just "lick the balls"
And the-

[Verse 3]
Off like a mouth once again comes a brother who mastered the skill
And a brother they bein' a criminal [?]
Cover your fuckin' mouth and contemplate what to do now
[?] product [?] 50 key to flame and [?]
The only way to walk in [?]
The reason it took so long is because [?] my soda in it
I hooked up with the [?] 'cause if anyone did then he knows
He said "Liquify, solidify, let it dry and there you go"
As the newfound information was analyzed
I saw what he meant right before my eyes
The unity that the family represent, the [?]
The ones who done it didn't give a fuck
Should've whooped your ass for stealing a hundred sixty bucks
(Goddamn right)
As for your family your nig' and your friend
He ran Iceberg Slim but didn't take the time to comprehend
'Cause if you did you wouldn't have went for the [?], Jack
You peeped the true colors [?]
And you still went back in the contract?
Ho ass nigga, how you [?] that
If I wanted to get technical, I'd tell you to give my lyrical skill back
And you might try to defend yourself by saying "how can he say?"
I'd [?] "you wanna know how?"
'Cause I done browsed through your notebook
And while I was looking through it, let me tell you what I was seeing
Seven percent [?] of the ninety three was me
And it's expressly manifested from the one them call
And that-

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
[?] just to bust some lyrics about them niggas who rap
In Kansas City, it's on because I've been wanting to do some shit like this for so long and now
A nigga from the Midwest is 'bout to give these sorry so-called rappers a TEC-9 to the chest
Now this is how they approach ya:
You probably get [?] niggas in the [?] within the group
You know that one of them raps then walk up to you and say
"Yo, I know that my homie can fuck you up on the flow"
And so I take 'em to [?] that's closed in
So when I beat on my chest and say my rhyme [?] so good that I get their eyes open, them niggas, they tripped
They heard "You stutter steppin' muthafucka, you!"
And they flipped, but that ain't even the half of the shit
When I got to breakin' 'em off, ayo they laughed at this shit
But yo, we steadily kickin' lyrics with this posse and all
But that muthafucka

[Verse 5: Ray-Dee]
Since this is the last verse I take the time to remains the tough
About those so cold raps or slashin' the [?]
That get on the stage and bust some shit
[?] while they dick is [?]
But let niggas like us throw a shit for these hoes
The press'll be bitching about the image we hold
They say it's just too negative
[?] the punks [?] who try to hang where we live
See, you never see me on a stage running, man
[?]
Just come out with a [?] commit suicide
And that dope or that pure shit that'll leave you begging for more
And only those that like hardcore will [?] record store
[?] pick up a [?] finally release
And you will be thoroughly disgusted
If you're expecting to hear "Increase The Peace", I turn the .36
[?] so I tell [?] and Fix to watch that shit
And begin to cuss and fuss 'em
Leave with a [?] dead president [?]
[?] dissing them man, uh huh, I'm just letting y'all know that
Where I come from it's never hammer time down in the ghetto
And if somebody told you that they straight balling, y'all
And that-
