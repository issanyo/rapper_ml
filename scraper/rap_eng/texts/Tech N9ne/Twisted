[Intro: Tech N9ne & Roger Troutman]
Sit back, listen to Tech N9ne
I don't know, it's just some shit I wrote, you know what I'm sayin'? (You know you twisted, mentally insane)
Uh, I really don't know what I'm saying
Shit, it's the first thing that came to my head (Twisted)
Man, it's crazy shit that I can't really explain
And it goes like this

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I gets, mo' trips than a little bit
I smoked, mo' dips than a little bit
I'm not that regular, when stepping, I can't wait 'til I can fly
Away from my competitor, yah, Satana can die
My psychosis hopeless, focus, notice
My metamorphosis, folks is broke and jokeless
Picture me in a syringe inserted in an overexerted felon
Antidote having 'em runnin' eternally across the hell and
Dwamn, losin' my sanity livin' up in Les Miserables
Fuck bitter broads, this shit is gonna have us stacking if there is a God
I'ma take the X away from generation, place it at the end of S.E
For the duration upon the level
Tell the devil to what? Skip a human
I' ma tell him, "Behold pale horses like us"
Shame on a nigga when he feelin'
Hella down for a '99 killin'
Ain't giving a fuck I'm putting Nair in your leave in hair conditioner
Now you Hari Krishna
To my listeners: In this rhyme you will find
Psychotic scriptures saying it's somethin' disrupting my mind

[Bridge: Roger Troutman]
Tech N9ne your mind is fine
There's just not anyone like you
The whole wide world don't matter no
They can't flow like you
I must make you understand

[Hook: Roger Troutman & Tech N9ne]
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
A, I'm lifted, B, I'm twisted
C, I'm sick and sadistic, A, B and C
Something's I do I just can't stand
Up in my bathroom I sex six women
Mentally, just me and me-
Me and my faithful right hand man
Tie up a Muslim and shoot him with liquid pork on Ramadan
With force, I'll make a Christian read their kids The Necronomicon on Christmas
Don't trip on this lyrical syphilis
I flip this so the yonks will catch vapors like mentho-lyptus
I'll feed a dominatrix patient pain pills
Give Wu haters permanent fang grills
Trick the artist formerly known and give him the same slave deal
I'll lift a couple of Dr. Dre's reels
Sell em' to Snoop and No Limit Soldiers just so I can see how paid feels
Hazy Shade of decayed hookers with grave shields
Where AIDS fills the carcass
Bet a milli on it Tecca N9na be the darkest
Heartless, I spark from the gut
So what the fuck?
I'm trying to contain the insane, but what?

[Hook: Roger Troutman & Tech N9ne]
But I get messed up (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Welcome to my asylum, it's hectic, they call me dyslexic
Rogue infested, more vicious than Cujo
Fraudulent tested, the punks arrested got the neck slit exit
I'm twisted, I know Hollywood backwards says "doowylloh"
Force feed me a sumo for about nine weeks playing Club Nuevo 'til he's blue, though
Then stuff him in the front seat of a Yugo
Body filled with beef and toaster strudel
Let up the break and watch him race to the intersection; now he's through, though - ya estuvo
I slide with a gang of twisted individuals
Somebody better be looking for the criminal tendencies
Never will they get us in the penitentiaries, killa
Millimeter nine rip vinyl, I know
Mix flow like Korean Albino
Wino once breeded an elephant with a rhino
Called it "The Helifino"
Throw Chuck Manson off in a pit of militant Jews banging hella opera
The real meaning of Helter Skelter is when they skin that forehead swastika
Am I twisted? Am I twisted?
I'm twisted, better keep your distance
Mama gotta call the psychiatrics for mental assistance

[Bridge: Roger Troutman]
Tech N9ne your mind is fine
There's just not anyone like you
The whole wide world don't matter no
They can't flow like you
I must make you understand

[Hook: Roger Troutman & Tech N9ne]
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
My thoughts are twisted (So mixed up)
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)
