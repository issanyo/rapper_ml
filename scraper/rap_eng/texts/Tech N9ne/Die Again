[Intro]
Huh-huh-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-hah-haha!
You know what the fuck this is, man?
Let me tell you..
This is "Die Again"
With Grave Plott, motherfucka!

[Verse 1: Killa C & Liquid Assassin]
My nigga's Killa C, I was born in a coffin
I'll murder your ass on the side where you walk and
We don't give a fuck, we don't give a shit
Get flatlined quick from the G.P, bitch

You gon' die motherfucka, die motherfucka
Die by the drug or the gun slug gon' fly
I'mma come slum, your gun's a * *
Cause I'mma rip 'em up the gut and bust mine
Get touched with the AK and snucked away
Or get a white * * where the weapon stay
Wreck your balls like * * *, man
Get smashed with a phone, Joe Pesci bang

Fucking high, it's time for you to die
I got a rusty spoon and I'm going for your eye
I'm a loose cannon, I spit straight fire
And I'll hang you from your balls from a telephone wire

Spit fire with fire, pop the trunk, get you pumped like a flat tire
Runnin' with a gauge, * a * right by ya
Behind you, I'mma * like Mike Myers
I'mma come through with * and war tools
Cock back, strapped to the blades, escort you
Fuck, spittin' flames on a * *
You over the edge, you can't fly, you're forced to

[Hook: Tech N9ne]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
How many motherfuckers wanna get hostile, we apostle
With the wicked gospel, on yo block with a monstrosity, call it chakraties
Dropping philosophies on how to kill augmenty, boss' really soft to me
Awfully trip, tryna get that thing off of me hip
I ain't trippin' off you jealous motherfuckers, and

Biggest gang on the globe and
* * * *, heinus when I pound, bitch
Bang with a insane chain gang, nigga, that's Strange shit
Rougher than a blood and crip battle spit on the streets
(I'm) tougher than your friend, but this chalice is on *
Liberate me, get up out my way if you ain't family
Insanity, calamity, await you, stuck in amity
Killa C with the * Tech N9ne, we snappin' necks and shit
We stackin' relish so you haters you can rest in piss
