[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Uh-huh , Yup, O-K. Whatever
Don't try to talk to me like you know what this is
Yeah, I know I might have symptoms that are familiar to you, but.. I got this
Thanks anyway..

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You don't see what I see
So how the hell you gonna stop these voices
In my head, that got me awfully rocky, do you copy?
Traumatized much, from homicide, what?
Don't wanna flip, but mama I must be the one I trust
I ain't got no friend, I ain't got no grin
But I'm macho when I lock, load, and I block foes in
When I stop souls in a rock, hold, I'ma drop those sins in a box so slim
Inside of my nog' grows grim
By heard, it goes deep
I serve and go weep
A vertical leap when you're alert in your sleep
Was a word of a treatment, somebody murdered more peace
Inside of my third it's so bleak
Done so much dirt I go leap to chief

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive
I only can see this world from the inside
And I'm holding it inside
Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
So I'm going on everything
Somebody get me out of here

[Verse 2: Andrew Holland]
From the first day out the womb, I've been a sort of pugilist
Small enough to fit in Daddy's palm, they were scared of losing him
My mind is wired differently to the point where you'd hear fuses tick
Can't run too fast, but I'm gonna try to keep up with the beat; it's moving quick
Muscles squeeze me like a vise
Blood's feeling as cold as ice
I don't trust myself; I make a choice and end up thinking twice
Brother had to sacrifice himself, gave me a better life
Would I keep on living if I knew I had to pay this price?
Yes, I take my doubts and turn 'em into accomplishments
Only takes hard work, luck, knowledge, and common sense
My optimism's prominent, I don't have time for drama, kids
I'm too busy screamin' "Yes, I can" like Pres. Obama, trick
Living life like a movie, break out the popcorn
I stand up for the little guy, yelling like a foghorn
Ready to fight more battles, I'm in top form
Hear 'em cheering for me, I think they want more
Oh!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Don't let this eat me alive

Feel like I can cock it back and let it go
And nothing's making sense
And I have no patience for anything
