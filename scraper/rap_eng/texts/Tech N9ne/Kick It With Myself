[Intro]
Turn the beat up a little bit more in here, Bengineer, please!
I guess I'm doing this one by myself
If you can't just be good with being by yourself
How you gonna be good pairing up with somebody else?
Love your damn self first

[Verse 1]
I was the only child 'til I was 13
Rather be lonely while dealin' with Earthlings
Still I am reclusive with drug and liquor abuses
Having a solitary time was never the worst thing (What we doing?)
Dedicating time to the craft (Yeah), levitatin' lines in the lab
Never hesitatin', rhymes hit the pad, when they resonate, N9ne get the bag
Then I medicate, the mind is the first thing (Woo!)
Yes, I live in my encephalon, I don't need all the rest of 'em
To stress the one blessing 'em, they're what you insert a speculum
Open it and hope you don't choke on something is gross in it
Jokin' this vocalist was by himself when he wrote this shit
I survive livin' in my mind, that line is for the people servin' time
Kickin' it wit' myself, created N9ne over time
That's why I'm one of the best at rippin' rhymes (Nina)

[Chorus]
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else

[Verse 2]
I done made millions (millions) livin' in the clouds
When I'm out within a crowd I am still one
I go to a sacred place like a pilgrim
In the mind, I'm on an island like Wilson!
People see me drift away
When the brain is workin' I never hear all the shit ya say
Why they pissed today 'cause whatever they say to me ricochet
They don't dig the way that I laugh after a big delay
I don't need a shrink, I need a sedative
I just need a drink to be repetitive
Lotta people think I need some etiquette
In payin' attention, I get 'em red a bit
And that'll get you nothing but cussin' at somebody breaded bitch
Sick and twisted I can kick it, we're just lickin', spliff get lifted
Some say I'm a misfit by the way that I'm drifted
But this gets the business, chips, bitches I'm gifted

[Chorus]
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else

[Verse 3]
Leave me by myself, watch what I'ma do
It won't be sittin' around watchin' Donahue
All I need is liquor and some ganja to continue to twirl top of the world like Obama do
And I might need a triple X video
In case wanna see her playin' with her kitty though
I know the ladies can't relate, you don't need nobody to bait
Lotta pretty hoes do it in my city, yoooo
Why am I alone?
'Cause people started rushin' me the day after I grabbed a microphone
Incognito, drinkin' my PÃ¡tron
You say you can't handle this, then you should probably play the xylophone
With me and my music, nothing could limit me
Just leave me in a baller suite with all the amenities
One is full throttle saloon 'shine from Tennessee
And don't forget the lemon, the Sprite and gallon of Hennessy

[Chorus]
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
Kick it with myself, kick it with myself, by myself
I don't need no help, I don't need no help, no one else
