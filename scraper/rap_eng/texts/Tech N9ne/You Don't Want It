[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
When you see me smilin', I'm really frownin'
You think you're really wildin'? I'm killa clownin'
Meaning I don't give a fuck about nothing you say that you do
Because stupid is how everybody sounded
Nigga you think you know me, but only if you knew me
Homie, you would leave me by my lonely
I'm thinking death and destruction
Images of blood and pus and I ain't looking for nothing but trouble
Thinking of murdering you when I'm just lounging
(That's just the devil, just the devil)
Block it out and keep it moving
I'm evil and it's pussy that I'm pursuing
Gimme the bible, yes I need it cause Tecca Nina's in ruin
Mentally I'm fuckin up when I really don't know what I'm doin'
My tolerance for physical pain has gained rapidly
I'm gobbling more thizzles then thangs but it came back at me
The holy father must have flipped and became mad at me
Because I'm pondering a wicked insane strategy
How to end it all (Yeah), many men will fall (Yeah)
Any sin I saw (Yeah), Nina been involved (Yeah)
You don't really want it with me punk you don't have the gall
The taste of blood on my tongue makin me want to brawl
No sentimental shit, death is the penalty
For any bitch you try to re-kindle this
It'll get your temple hit
Bout to bubble, about to pop just like a pimple get
Send it something so insane I'm so not for simple shit
So teeter totter mothafucka if you want it
But just keep it to the left of me, crazy til the death of me
Pussy money more money blood and guts is the recipe
Having hella drama for Nina is a necessity
Good and bad is fightin' within me and I'm the referee
Shit is looking like it is evil getting the best of me
Bitches think I'm pleasant and really wantin' the sex with me
I'm promisin' you I'm losing it, you don't really want to mess with me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me

[Verse 2: Mr. Reese]
Betta load up your drums
Load up your guns
Everybody better get to runnin'
You don't want it with me
I'm a lyrical cynical rippin' ya pinnacle
Damage anybody when I see they really want it with me
Techa-ninna told me nigga get money
And never been dumby
Shit on a nigga when he comin' funny with me
Follow the beat follow your feet
Gimme the weed keys G's
And a quarter pound of bullets with a machete
Mister Reese known for getting it poppin
You niggas be droppin'
And when you do your albums be floppin
When ever I spit it
Man better yet when ever I drop it
Your wifies gone cop it
She even tell you nigga go cop it
You don't want it with me
I'll fuck your life up like a disease
I'm hauntin your dreams
With a fully auto choppa them beams
Mayne yadadamean
Ya life ain't shit but a dream
So just remember when your breathin' you don't want it with me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me

[Verse 3: Prozak]
And you don't want it from me
See I'm believing that people are really angels and demons
Instead of human beings
I'm havin' feelings of wanting to be the cause of you bleeding
Causin' your family to be grieving now your soul is leaving
Entered in my mind the raw holy words and religious battles
Keep 'em mutilated like cannibal over serpent rattles
I'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows
As I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles
My eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums
It's time to hit the streets with guns
I'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run
I plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done
Until the pain coincides with my violence and agony
Oh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me
But it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds
The Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You don't wanna see me run up with the thang (Cock back)
Make it chicka bang bang (You don't want it with me)
If you don't really want it nigga (Fall back)
Cause to killas it ain't never been a thang (You don't want it with me)
And I can get in to ya if you feel you really want it
One of us ain't gonna make it out
You don't want it with me
I'm kinda sick and psycho grab ya feelin like I'm Michael
Push it you'll see what I'm talking bout
You don't want it with me
