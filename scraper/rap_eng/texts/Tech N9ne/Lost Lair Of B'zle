[Intro: Tech N9ne & Man's Voice & Both Audience]
You sure this is the place?
Yep, the house of Brian Beezle Dennis
Didn't they say this place is haunted or something?
Man, that's just some bullshit until I was inside, 'cause if the story's correct, this is where all this sick Tech shit was created
So if we were like to find something - we could like sell it right?
You damn right! Now watch my back while I break this window
[Sound Of Window Smashing]
Okay, you go that way, and I'll go this way
Holla if you see something
Hey, I think I found something!
It's the bar-code cross! Move!
Now they say you're s'posed to -- twist the nine
Well, wh-, twist it
Sh- nigga, you twist it
I'll twist it
Oh, shit!

Kansas City All Day, God Damn It!
K-C Bo
Come on!
Whoa
