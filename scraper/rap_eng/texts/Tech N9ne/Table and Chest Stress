[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I'm about to take it back to sixth grade on y'all
When I ain't had no beats
I just beat on the table and my chest
Like this

[Hook x2]
I'm here to give you my table and chest stress
Life is so full of fear like an A-I-D-S test
When you’re covered in wet sex
With no glove you're just vexed
Because life is so less blessed
Feel like death is the best bet

[Verse 1]
I mean, ain't no way up out of this dream
Nowhere to skip a scene not with all them demons stuck on the screen
So many unrest I bring serene living within means green
But things seem bleak
I'm beesteemed for the kings team
Major corporations firin’ I feel obligated to hire ‘em
Higher desired I’m wired my empire is tiresome
But if she fly I’ll invite her to my asylum
Alumni find relaxation off in her bonsai
This bad season got me in my past sneezin’
Seeing the mother fucka singin' taking the Nina away but I guess they had reasons
’till I had freakin' ash leakin’ nap seepin’ Crash deacon
Givin’ a sermon off my sick and twisted class teachin'
You see now this ain't no fuckin freestyle
My people starvin’ to eat now with the Angela Yee gal and Phillip chow
Niggas is ready to freak out
Yea I got a little money to piece out
To some but the rest be plottin’ on me wanna stick me up like a decal

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
My Hungarian honey's locked up for manslaughter
Now her mother and father can't even hug their damn daughter
Such an insane part of life really became harder
Only way they saw me in jail was to visit Dwayne Carter
Then I'm off in Spain sort of lame ’cause no dame sought us
Never did play with the labia
All I ate was paella
Then ex bitches its all part of the Tech riches
So I get threats they get vicious
They know I keep with the best bitches
Then I sex with it
To bend her over the table is less stress
With no bra and her breast on the table her chest pressed
My people fallin’ while I continue to jet set
But I got the power to bless
The beat bangin’ yea that's Tech nigga!
