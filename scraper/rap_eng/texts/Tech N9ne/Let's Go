[Intro]
Eep Opp Ork Ah-Ah
That means I love you if you clock dollas
Yes, ain't no stoppin' there
Let's go, let's go if you choppin' broccoli

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Let’s go
If your sittin' at home talking to him on the phone
And he a clone without no style of his own
You wishin' that you was gone, throwin' back the Patrón?
You ain't wrong because you’d rather be with me in the zone
Let’s go
Sorry, your lady has been taken
You can find us up at the M.O. with the flo' shakin'
And I ain't even the one that’s bringin' her home the bacon
You the one been talking 'bout kickin' my face in?
Let’s go
You can do whateva' you gonna
My rebel persona that got me dressin' red as I wanna, ahead ya', stronger
The problem is you dead as a coma
You sick of me, but I’m right here to put the medicine on ya
Let’s go
Got 'em all frightened of the titan
You mice men too light to get fights in with the bison
It's so exciting, my Benz reeled your wife in
I ruin your life when I produce a license

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Let’s go
Coming through the do', hella fast, never slow
Got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'
Let’s go
If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low, whatcha' standin' there fo'?
Let’s go
You can hate 'cause I’m dippin' witcha' mate
Out the gate, let’s roll, let’s bounce, let’s skate
Let’s go
To the room
Let’s go
To the lick
Let’s go
Your boyfriend ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Let’s go

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Posted up, squatin' low like a pit
Ya' know this Patrón changed the whole motion of ya' shit
And I ain't got a desire to proceed without a grip
So we can just do it movin' if it's all on the bitch
Let's go
They likin' the skinny jeans and the kicks
And jewl-e-wels
But I ain't into pleasin' a trick
I'm in the topless Porsche's and keys to a six
So sit back and let the engine breathe a lil bit
Let's go
But I'm highly into hoochie holla harry mode
"Money over beezys" got it from my uncle Larry though
Superstar to many without playin' on your radio
Addicted to va-gina when she ain't around ve-nereal
Let's go
Kutt Kutty Calhoun is the scenario
Kansas City to Oakland
Folks them be like there he go
Tell 'em it's Raider game
He soakes it up everywhere he go
And give you a problem for denerio
There you go

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Let’s go
Coming through the do', hella fast, never slow
Got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'
Let’s go
If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low, whatcha' standin' there fo'?
Let’s go
You can hate 'cause I’m dippin' witcha' mate
Out the gate, let’s roll, let’s bounce, let’s skate
Let’s go
To the room
Let’s go
To the lick
Let’s go
Your boyfriend ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Let’s go

[Verse 3: Mistah F.A.B.]
Giddy up down, gotta skip town, girl is you ready to roll?
Well shit, let’s go. Hit that K.C. M.O. straight from the O'
I got that dro, sip that purp. we call it Bow
I hit that burb, and get that urge to knock down all your doors
Get in this car. I’m a star, you ain't noticed yet?
Look at these shoes, look at these jewels shinin' on my neck
I spit that venom, then I send 'em in then remove her denim
And once I'm in 'em, then I bend 'em, not I can’t remember 'em
I stay persistent and consistent when it comes to pimpin'
Your ho gets sentenced from when sin 'tis hit with no repentance
I go the distance when I hit it fuck like I'm demented
Positions switchin' positions shiftin' like I invented
The art of fuckin' suduction we goin' tit for tat
And when she suckin' I'm bustin' I'm tryin to hit here tat
They say her dude name, but really he's too lame
Fabby and Tech N9ne you know that we are too strange

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Let’s go
Coming through the do', hella fast, never slow
Got the cash, and the pedal to the flo'
Let’s go
If you wanna ride, let me know
We can slide on the low, whatcha' standin' there fo'?
Let’s go
You can hate 'cause I’m dippin' witcha' mate
Out the gate, let’s roll, let’s bounce, let’s skate
Let’s go
To the room
Let’s go
To the lick
Let’s go
Your boyfriend ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Let’s go
