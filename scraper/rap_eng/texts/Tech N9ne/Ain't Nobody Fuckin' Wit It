[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Ha-ha-ha-ha, we 'bout to do this
Tech Nina, Sole
'Bout to make that ass hot baby
Like this, yo

[Female singing]
I heard the party didn't stop
'Til Tech Nina got ill one man crew, runnin' through you
Niggas let their cash drop, ladies made that ass hot
Make 'em say "ooh", that's what we do

[Tech N9ne]
This one's for the niggas in the club
Fucked up, full of liquor
Fittin' to let the Tech N9ne feelin' hit you
Everybody respect mine when I spit the INSANE (Ish)
Killer, killer, doin' damage to a nigga BRAIN (Ish)
Haters can't maintain

[Sole]
Killin' everybody with a Midwest flow
I'mma let a nigga know 'bout fly Sole
Bad to the bone, with the fucked up jump
So we all get drunk and crunk all day
We hard, let's keep all this marvelous shit
We killin' everything
And Tricky started all of this shit

[Tech N9ne & Sole]
Ayo, get paid, never get sprayed
Tech and Sole be the brainiacs
Warner Brothers and DreamWorks
So I guess we're Animaniacs
All the niggas in the back
Get with the ladies in the front
From side to side, we gon' survive
And get what the fuck we want
That's right

[Hook: Sole & Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker

[Tech N9ne]
I'm dancin' with this bitch with an ass so fat
Had to dash to the back hit that ass from the back
With that ass in my rap put that ass on the map
I come from 6-6 triple-8 46 99 3's
Home of the killers KC villain niggas on the grind buying G's
Ask me to bomb and I will, ask me to be calm and I kill
I got that wild style and your shit ain't real
Your shit is simply un-real-is-tic
Your bitch sickness gets dismissed with a quickness
This lip sick get the lipstick kiss this dick
In a minute I'mma bust this flow, I'mma let these suckers know
Nine millimeter is about to blow and I'm out to get your ho
Percolate the first to shake that ass and get that cash stack
All the player haters better stand back when I flashback
Ish hot, knowin' (?) in your club and I'm kinda scold dragon
Yo, I thought you heard Tech Nina got that ground control
All up in your bitch's bra with that ass exposed, yo

[Hook: Sole & Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker

[Sole]
Na-na-na-na-na, you can not fuck with
Tech N9ne and Sole, comin' with the rough shit
Off in the club, me and my girls lookin' lovely
Lots of killer thugs be wishin' they could fuck me
If you's a hustle man, throw your hands up
Throw my hands up, I did it cause this ho just ran up
The way you busters try to step to me, it's killin' me
Stank breath, mackin' law thrown out, 3 mil be drillin' me, no
Yellin' about ki's and dope, broke
I hope you take notes and shove this cake, about 20 down your throat
Scope, wash your mouth out with soap
Ladies dressed with power, awfully remote
Time, nigga it's wine, throwin' rhymes, killer be mine
Blowin' nine, and I'mma shine, growin'
Hella ass I'm showin', I see you in the back freakin'
Everybody in the front tweekin', while me and Tech be peakin'
Off in the club scene every weekend, we the shit
Throwin' rough ride full of grit, ass that you wanna get
Twit, beware my bite it truly venomous when I spit
Beauty and the beast, you hear in the club or the street
On the back seat of your Jeep, over peak rollin' deep cause

[Hook: Sole & Tech N9ne]
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker
Ain't nobody fucking with it, y'all niggas forget it
Ain't nobody fucking with it, cause we kill 'em
And these hoes and niggas know we keep it rough
And make it rougher
Cause all we wanna see is you dancing in the motherfucker

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
This nigga Tricky got me drunk
Off this motherfuckin' Hennessy and Alize baby
We off in ATL kickin' it for Sole baby
You know what I'm shizzlin'?
Too much ass in one room baby
Shake what your motherfuckin' mama gave ya
Tech Nina in this bitch
For the year 2-thou baby
It's all delicious, Tech N9ne, bitch
(Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce...)
