Intro
Hello again
Its Me
(Welcome Back Baby)
Its me Technie, Tech N9ne
Scriptures

And the enemy said, may he be deceased
May he rest in pain with no peace
Then the Lord said, let there be Tech the resurrector, the resurrected, god reflects
I been through hell
Muthafuckas
Satan sentence me life, in four days I made bail
Muthafuckas
So when you sleeping hit the ruckus
Get to callin you reverend
Tell em I just seen the ghost of Tech N9ne
Less I'm trippin, reverend said
Ya-op I just heard him on the Wake Up Show
Rippin
And reverend call Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
And Terry said Jimmy damn, how do we lose it
The Tech Nina
Jam and Terry blamed
Sharron and kept steppin
Resurrection of a concealed weapon
Went from Satan to Nathan
And you gotta respect it
In eight seconds here's the story in a nutshell
(Check it)
He was a rapper with a record deal back in
Nueva two(92)
About to make a mill, but he never could
Make a big amount of paper
Cause he knew it then It wasn't ever real
A break up with the crew
Another blow
Than Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis
Had to let him go
Then he had a funeral
And everybody heard
Him back up killing hackers to the finish
And now I'm back with a vengeance
A vendetta
They thought it was a biretta
But never the Tech is severs whatever
Thought I wouldn't prevail, i'd fail
Tell you cronies  I'm back here sending
Muthafuckas to hell

[Chorus]
Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murda for the bunch of ya's
Sometimes
Sometimes, Sometimes
They tell you that they will come back
Sometimes, Sometimes

(What,What)

[Verse Two]
I rotted, rested in torment than I got it
Satan didn't want me to see the light but I spotted it
So I got out of it
Wrote raps in a deep dark pit
The more I flip shit with ripped lips
The doper I get
Reincarnation turned me into somethin
Obviously something that you wantin
A nigga to get in somebody's ass when the frontin
They its best to prepare those hoes
I'm the shadow in the field eatin away at the scarecrows
I'm back for blood, I'm back for guts
And if you ain't apart of that love you gots to duck
Blame Ms.Hayward for the way I come
Bullshit I take none
Fuck skin horn management
I role will black and Juan Kson
I remember when
Rough house, Tommy Boy, and MJJ said I wasn't right
Now it's a muthafucka here Techa Nina go bump in the night
(exoticism)
Is out of the question, I'm never gently flown
I went from bum to a nigga breakin bread with Quincy Jones(nigga)

[Chorus]

Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murda for the bunch of ya's
Sometimes
Sometimes,Sometimes
They tell you that they will come back
Sometimes, Sometimes

[Verse Three]

Yo I seen a lot of things
To even things, listen to the ruckus this
Heathen brings this evening
I'm back in this and so happy I can dance
Or even sing.  Nop, Just take a title from Stephen King
To let you know, ain't no holding us
Foes get a rapnophobia
Bow down when I flow to ya
Ya'll niggas don't really wanna bang
Especially with a shutter cane
Ain't nothing but a thing when I whip a
Haters ass like Clubber Lang
Fuck 103
When I blow up don't ya'll be touching on me
Fuck Miron D, and I'm cool with Tony G
And Shaun nigga, we got a bond nigga with the 9 Milla
We can't go wood, we going platinum
Fat stakes cus I'm cappin em
Hale to my niggas in jail
Cameron, Mobiley, El Dorreto
Who niggas pray for my hefty payroll
So I can pay yo asses when you get done with your classes
We rip shows rubbin elbows with the masses
Thank god that I'm back when I explode
Imma show ya'll this
Ain't to tombstone in no 6 foot ditch
Been dead for four years
Buried in Acropolis but it must be Easter Sunday
Cuz I'm right back in this bitch

[Chorus]
Because
Sometimes
They come back to haunt ya
Taunt ya
Test you don't want ta come to blows Tech n9ne
Hella murda for the bunch of ya's

He shall believe when he busts
He shall appease us on, the needs
Cuz was grievous
