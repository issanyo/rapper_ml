[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Threw her in the trunk)
Was tryin' to smash, get her cash
But her mouth was hella fast, so I threw her ass (in the trunk!)
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in and let the beat bump
(Threw her in the trunk!)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
2K11, ridin' solo
In the Benz on twins hella low pro
Slangin' CDs out the trunk for mo' dough
My mojo said, "a thick bitch" so I go slow
I pull it over tryin' to get up on her bumper
Wantin' to crunch her so I said, "baby my new CD is a slumper"
It'll make the trunk thunder, girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
But she said fuck Tecca Nina didn't feel her
Did everything within' my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock, she flippin' out
I pop the trunk she crunk but I ain't 'bout to chicken out
I'm sick and tired of bein' nice and lettin' shit go by
She said fuck that Tech N9ne bullshit so I

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'm bumpin' everything that beat like gangsta shap
I bangs the rap, in her ear 'til she gives thanks to that
Never take a prisoner where you hang your hat
I'ma roll around with her in the trunk
Poppin' that Tech N9ne slump 'til the little bitch faint collapse
I'ma roll to Topeka
Tecca Nina'll reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka
Crispy flows through my tweeters
Bumpin' this ring when I roll through atita
Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakers
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Get out the god damn trunk, get on the ground! Take off your god damn belt!
Put it 'round your ankles, I'ma tie up your wrist myself! (Okay, okay)
I just wanted to drink and show you what the dong'll do!
BITCH! The hell wrong with you?

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Eyy, the hot sex was not slam dunked
Rolled for hours then I stopped right off Van Brunt
When a bitch talkin' crazy like a lost man's chump
Short say "I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk!"

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hours turned to days, days turned to weeks
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she can drink and eat
Whatever I stuffed through the holes hot dogs and ho-hoes
Kidnapped on the low low, spoke no mo' oh no go slow, there the po-po
I gotta ditch this bitch with the quickness
Man I just remembered this benzo is lifted
From Swope Park, that's where I'm 'bout to go dart, let her know art
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart, it got so dark

[Interlude: Newswoman]
Police are still looking for 21 year old Crystal Nelson
Who has been missing since last Sunday
Friends and family told police that they thought this was
Yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions
But after all this time, they're still worried sick

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
It's been fun momma, fed her my catalog like Adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her y'all
In a ditch, walked back to the trunk, wicked is how I sounded
Whispered, "Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch"
(Threw her in the trunk!)

[Outro: Police officer]
I think I've found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park-uh
In a ditch near shelter five
It's kinda appears the car is still running-uhm
Music playing, I'm approaching the car now
Let me turn down the music
(God damn [?])
I'ma go ahead pop the trunk
There's an African-American female [] been shot up and appears to be delirious
It could be the girl that's missing from last week
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)
(Tech Tech Nine Nine Tech Tech Nine Nine)

(Threw her in the trunk)
Heheheheh..
