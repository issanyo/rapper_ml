Let me get in this verse (Tech N9ne)
Skatterman and Snug Brim

I'm that nigga
Hoppin' out that tour bus
Buttoned up Christian Dior
Cuz I'm that nigga
Don't I just look like
Money rollin' kush, make it rain, little buddy homie
I'm that nigga
Actin all ass like you motherfuckers
Thousand dollar bills suck it duckas
I'm that nigga
So you better recognize
