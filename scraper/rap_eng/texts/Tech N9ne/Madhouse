[Verse 1:Violent J]
Somebody open up the fucking door and let me in
The world's about to get me again
Shit ain't pretend!
I'm safer in the Madhouse, clinging to the ceiling like a spider
I'm out of your mind, like frozen fire
Razor blade fingernails scratching my neck
Lost in a maze, I found a dragon barbequeing the back
An arm came up out the toilet, and scrotched my balls
That shit hurt, got me headbutting holes in the walls
I want to see you
I hear you
I catch spirits and ghosts by their invisible throats and then tear through
Never scary boo bitch, I'm a Kamakazi
Swimming through the living room watching Joany and Johnn
And then I realized I'm potsy trapped in the TV
Sombody changed the channel and got the better of me

[Hook]
You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Your ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
So many dimensions in my encephal
These levels of diss and devil
Ain't been alright since the ghetto
Better wait till my temper settle
Cause my mind is a madhouse
The Nine finna spaz out
Player haters don't throw stones if you grind in a glass house
Sometimes when I lash out
I pass out
How sick and insanse and vain can this be
Want to fly your little head like a frisbee
Six six triple eight forty six ninety-nine thrisde
This Strange and Psychopathic homie this is not Disney
The Madhouse continues
To pin you
Send you
Psycho bitches to the back of the venue
Then you slitther when I come hither off up in you
Then my homies 2 dope and Jay do you up somthin real Ginsu
Level of madness
Ecstasy, shrooms, and acid
Beast released but you can't find me in lake placid
Finally in Missouri Dizzily struttin with a bad bitch
Her last kiss disastrous ICP on some Mad Shit!

[Hook]
You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
My...House... Mad House
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!

Peekaboo anybody home? where you at?
Tryin to be sneaky creeping behind me motherfucker I saw that rail
Maybe its a mirror but bullshit I seen a different person
He was grabbing his nuts and spitting and cursin at me fag!
There's some things in this life that I fail to understand
Even as a grown man, man, I still don't comprehend
Like how in the fuck did I walk up the stairs
And some fucking how I ended up down here
Well laughing and giggleing like a little school girl
With my homies Jay and Tech ain't even there Hmmm
(Tickle Ticke Tickle! Hahaha!) What the fuck
Not a damn single bitch in this place but some how one is fidgeting my nuts
(Skeet! Skeet! Skeet! Ahhhh) I got it done
Well sitting with my pants around my ankles dry humping my hand
A lot of mother fuckers claim the insanity plea
But not me
It's this house that's gone mad I'm as sane as can be!

[Hook]
You ain't never getting in and we ain't never getting out
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
It don't matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
Mad...House... Mad House
It dont matter where you run to scream or shout
Cause I hold the key to unlock this madhouse!
