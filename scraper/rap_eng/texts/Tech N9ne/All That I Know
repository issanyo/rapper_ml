[Hook: Brian Angel]
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Shit, what I do?
The bitches shuffle to the front when I come
Clap your hand & stomp your foot to the rhyme cougar
Roll the die hit the blunt
Listen to the rhythm of the rapper, ass whooper
I click-clack like a gat, spitter
Broke up with my rap, but I'm back with her
Don't fuck with my greens or
You don't want the Hulk to get mad nigga?!
Nigga, nigga, with a motherfucking man right here
Nigga nigga put his foot in your shit, or
Make a nigga slap in your ass, kisser
Let that nigga do the little song
Write it to the music, feel it work it
Soon as Trae e-mail me the beat
I'mma take it to the booth and I'mma kill it, murk it
Curse it, bless it, church it, cash it, change it, purse it
Tell them niggas that I'm back on the block
And I got them killer verses
Tell 'em to sell 'em the one for ten
I'd let them go, two for five
Either way, I'mma get that ten
Or you don't get none of these rhymes
Long as I murder these shows and hurdle these hoes
Shorty don't go and I don't have to be working that lows
I rock jewelry that glows with a rap name, twenty years old
Shit, what else can I say? Fuck, that's all that I know!

[Hook: Brian Angel]
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know

[Verse 2: Trae]
I am the street king, took a minute to lock shit
Money, bitches and gunplay, you ain't gon' block shit
Overdose in my hand, tell 'em I can't feel 'em
Diamonds all over my fingers, that'd be on CÃ®roc shit
I been livin' all player, ever since shit off
Haters on all my dick like women, they'd better get off
You can find me in the gutter, scared of heights
Sitting on a couple of mill, money tall I'm tryna get off
Clique like brothers, tell 'em to give 'em the blues
They recievin' the call of competition I won't lose
I'm a fool, when I lace these shoes with these tools
Leavin' niggas abused of something off in the crew
Speakin' of [?] crews, tell niggas ain't nothin' new
Used to kick it one thing, now hoes come in the two's
Run upon 'em like murder, should've been on the news
I shoot 'em in they face, they leave with no clues
All the way to the boulevard walkin' in all glass
Tell the bank-teller person I'll count it in all cash
Everybody be talkin' but I'mma pull up and show 'em somethin'
And go to wreckin' shit like I been in a bad crash
In the hood, I'm access for real
Ask [?], he'll tell you that I was Trill
Million dollar mouthpiece, one hell of a grill
I thug Universal, don't sweat it, I got a deal
Anybody wanna run up I'll tell 'em I'm in this bitch
If a hater got a problem I'm probably up in his bitch
You all want truth, you gon' find him up in a ditch
I'll bang his ass up like [?] when I'm makin' hits
You can tell 'em I'm sick, rare form of cancer
I am the truth, I guarantee you the answer
Anybody who lookin' tell 'em to look no more
If I don't get the proper respect, I'm kickin' they door

[Hook: Brian Angel]
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know
It's all that I know, it's all that I know

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I be in the corner with the bitches
Off in the club I be grantin' many wishes
All the haters be super suspicious
As to why they sniffin' I make super digits
Makin' beautiful music and then a bita'
Aphrodisiac to get bitches to swoon
But I catch 'em quick with these incredible tunes
Me stickin' poon will be inevitable soon
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, I'll be laughin' at these busters
Think they smashin' and we suckers
But we blastin' at these fuckers
Trippin' over colors, you niggas, you gotta love us
No matter the set I'mma get up and rip 'em into pieces
He's beneath me and needs to be treated
Like a flea with a beast and believe he's heated
Because of my talent they mad
And I'm never gonna challenge their ass
'Cause my balance for nada pay cash
You suckers down there but my wallet say "Bad
Motherfucker" like Samuel L
You perpetrators I'mma damn you to hell
Your bitches love to hear this animal yell
Try to beat me, understand you will fail!
In control of all of my dough
Now it's off to the mall I go
You the money really tall I show
If you really wanna brawl I know
That you niggas gonna fall to my toes
I be killin' all of y'all when I blow
'Cause a nigga comin' raw when I flow is all that I know
