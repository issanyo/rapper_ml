[Verse 1]
A rose is not a rose if you don't let it bloom at all
If you can't help them out, no one to catch them when they fall
And people have a chance to signal me before they merge
They eat the poison served by who they serve and still they splurge
I'm logged onto the nonsense cause I'm conscious of their fight
I filled right in my search engine the drug that I don't like
So maybe we should die to let them give us drugs to live
Or keep yourself so high you twerk right in front of your kids
This ain't no love

[Hook]
I can't believe in you with no soul in me
There's a hole in me
If that's so, this liquor will get me where I'm supposed to be
Ain't no love in me
I never said you would be B-E-A-U-T full
The world is dead to me and people are not useful
No love, you get no love
No love, you get no love

[Verse 2]
If I believe in God, the cops would stop and let me go
They kill me in the Bible belt, I guess Allah don't know
And you won't even smile, it ain't my fault you chose this job
I'm paranoid, I'm on TV, now I'm the one to rob
And damn these kids and their tight pants and I can't do their dance
My Xbox One, my PS4, it keeps me in a trance
Now these pills, that doctor bills, and I feels
I can kills the next person who spills a ill syllable
I think I just grew up too quick
The world don't know who they fu-
Yeah, Yeah
This ain't no love

[Hook]
I can't believe in you with no soul in me
There's a hole in me
If that's so, this liquor will get me where I'm supposed to be
Ain't no love in me
I never said you would be B-E-A-U-T full
The world is dead to me and people are not useful
No love, you get no love
No love, you get no love

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Aw yeah?
Y'all wanna resort to brutality still?
Been trying to get you all up out of these ills
Up to my level and without any shield but
Your evil is undoubtedly real
So your religion gets a fallacy seal
Extinction level event is how you'll be killed
You're screaming at me for help, you shout at me, "Chill"
How dare you kill innocent people and do it in my name
When I came from above with love
Never gotta put an end to the world's evil migraine
It'll vanish
The fury that man has sent them all into  a manic panic
Now they wanna call me God of this planet
So it's my duty to damn it

[Hook]
I can't believe in you with no soul in me
There's a hole in me
If that's so, this liquor will get me where I'm supposed to be
Ain't no love in me
I never said you would be B-E-A-U-T full
The world is dead to me and people are not useful
No love, you get no love
No love, you get no love
