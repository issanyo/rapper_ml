[Intro]
Are you ready for some F.U.N. tonight?
Ha, are you ready for some F.U.N. tonight?
I wanna have a little F.U.N
You wanna have a little F.U.N
Everyone, let's have F.U.N., the F.U.N.'s begun

[Verse 1]
I'm different, you can see the Nina from a distance
My sixth sense tell me you're hating on me again
Persistent, jealousy and resistance
For my existence, so I gotta go for your chin
Workin' out, you can keep on workin' out
But your chin ain't workin' out, now your teeth are burstin' out
BAANG! Fowl thangs lookin' how thou came
So I gotta lift up millimeter and eat them like chow mein
I feel like F.U.N., thats why I will never be thus a real live one
The kind of F.U.N. that make them pull a 30 round drum
You givin' me negativity and really sound dumb
When you say to me "You still rappin'? I ain't heard ya since '01"
Don't make a nigga beat you down like showin' up the Shogun
Then have to glow son, I'm like the chose one
And you not knowin' when to respect the Nina makes it like so F.U.N.!

[Hook]
Any time somebody come and disrespect I say F.U.N
When they trippin', look them in the eye and say F.U.N
When they get the picture they might go for they gun
They been hatin' on me from day one!
F.U.N.'s what ya need to say (Fuck u niggas)
Got guns on me either way (Fuck u niggas)
That's F.U.N. everybody say F.U.N. (Fuck u niggas)
Say (Fuck u niggas) Hey (Fuck u niggas) Alright

[Verse 2]
Diamonds on my neck, got diamond on my wrists
Pierced diamond in their lips, so it's diamonds on my dick
That's your chick, know when I rock the McRick spits sick
She strips quick cause Nina's big shit
And you say you ain't even heard nothin' new played
Since the Calm Before the Storm and you don't like me today
That's the reason I gotta tell you Uck Fay Ou Yay
And I'm off in El Paso fuckin' a bitch named Guadalupe
I'm straight F.U.N with it, you niggas done did it
Dumb shit is when you compare me to my nigga young with it
Now ain't that sum shit-it, we two different things
With two different schemes, but be off on your ladies tongue with it
And I have her so sprung, when you hate for nothin' nigga
We can get to bustin' havin' them puffin' air out of your lung
That's how the MO run, I be like so stunned when
You don't even rep or respect it so I go F.U.N.!

[Hook]
Any time somebody come and disrespect I say F.U.N
When they trippin', look them in the eye and say F.U.N
When they get the picture they might go for they gun
They been hatin' on me from day one!
F.U.N.'s what ya need to say (Fuck u niggas)
Got guns on me either way (Fuck u niggas)
That's F.U.N. everybody say F.U.N. (Fuck u niggas)
Say (Fuck u niggas) Hey (Fuck u niggas) Alright

[Verse 3]
Give me my props nigga, who you know got them yellin' KC
MO overseas makin' Europe straight hop nigga
I need a answer man, you a cancer man
And I'm rockin' strippers in Switzerland and in Amsterdam
Ask Snoop Dogg, he will tell you all that I'm too tall
To be studyin' any of you goof balls
So gone you never find Nina like Lou Rawls
Except on billboard or Poll-Star so fook y'all

[Interlude]
I don't care where ya go all around the world, if you tell them, you from Kansas City, the first thing they gon' say is "Do you know Tech N9ne?" and you better jeff and say "That's the Kansas City king, I love him!"
