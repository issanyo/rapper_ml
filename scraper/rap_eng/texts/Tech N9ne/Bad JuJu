[Intro]
I hit back
I hit back, I hit back, I hit back, I hit back
I hit back, I hit back, I hit back, I hit back

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
We lashin' out at you, you think you 'bout it, we 'bout it too
Only difference is my clout is too massive
We active when actors give malice to anybody we close to
I'll approach you with the woop-wop that'll soak you (so true)
Already be so much we go through, now we gotta rid you in the MO zoo
This is tribal, stick his rival in the mouth with a right blow then he get this pyro
Young punk better lie low somewhere prolly up in Cairo
With a Bible when a psycho wanna give a hater lypo
When the knife go with the quickness, you so full of bitchness
You trip flippin' on chicks but a b-boy make him wanna shit bricks
This is vicious, everything out yo lips is fictitious, hehe
Misses made me mad as Mozzy, huh
Man the motive must been made of molly, huh
Milli maximize a mess with a mind of Malcolm X
And a martyr man whose mom is Maude, huh
Better be cool, I'ma lead you to the B fools
That'll greet you with a (blacca, blacca, blacca) leave you
In the coffin often talkin' fecal
I'm a grown mane, takin' this with no shame
Really wanna have no brains, step foot into my domain, no games
All of my children are grown and I'm feelin'
They love me but don't really like me, I'm illin'
I'm no longer locked in a marriage, I'm careless
So anyone of my loved ones you funk, I'll inherit
This is my fury, fuck being  Nzuri
I tried that, now I keep a gun in my lap
Talkin' so cheap and when it don't end with the grievin'
I'm ready for the battle, bring it on this evenin'

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Comin' at me wrong is bad JuJu
You better not make me Soo-Woo you
So you best better go run, tell your crew
Do somethin' new-new
And it better be habari gani ndugu!
Don't make me fight y'all, the fully gon' bite y'all
Ears ringin' like sixty gun night ball
Yeah, spray ya like Lysol, you don't wanna let night fall, light y'all!

[Verse 2: King Iso]
This be the entry of this B
But not no Pyramus chicks peep us
Eye be hella open top a pyramid, it's Giza
Dip please 'cause I'm Khufu, did you get me? Tellin' you move
Better quit beefin', or this heat, hit 'em then I dip, au jus you
On a hater's Kufi, I go cuckoo or booboo like I shit fevers
I don't wanna check a temp neither, to emcees I'm the Grim Reaper
So anybody comin' at me trippin' like you ran around the world with ten visas
Bet I'll really get to pullin' everybody's card like I had a chip reader
This is Iso, big dick psycho, smash his chick and then skate like a kick flip, grind mode
They ain't wanna see me rockin' with Tech N9ne though, yeah I know
Could imagine what you all'll think if Tech signed Iso (would you cry bro?)
Gettin' big like Bruce Bruce, mimi ni ajabu foo'
Hit a hater hella hard, he'll have more clips hit 'em than Hulu, who knew?
Me and Tech'll get to cheffin' up shit like couscous?
If you think you fuckin' with us, ball up your opinion and shove it in your poop shoot, 'cause

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Comin' at me wrong is bad JuJu (nigga)
You better not make me Soo-Woo you
So you best better go run, tell your crew
Do somethin' new-new
And it better be habari gani ndugu!
Don't make me fight y'all, the fully gon' bite y'all
Ears ringin' like sixty gun night ball
Yeah, spray ya like Lysol, you don't wanna let night fall, light y'all!

[Outro: Tech N9ne & King Iso]
This could be federal, take me for feedin' you several (Don't do it Tech)
I'm on a pedestal, should I come down or just let it go? (Just let it go)
This could be federal, take me for feedin' you several (Don't do it Tech)
I'm on a pedestal, should I come down or just let it go?
Don't make me fight y'all, sixty gun night ball
Yeah, spray ya like Lysol, night fall, light y'all!
