[Intro: Don Juan]
It's a lot of Mitch Bades out there that don't understand how Tech N9ne and Don Juan puts it down and make hits
Told y'all Midwestside never quits
So now I want you to bounce
And realize that we're Rogue Dog, true for life
And when we ride we bounce
And let the whole world know that, uh
Mizzizy gets bizzy, so check it

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
We Mizzizy living eye for eye
Dem who diss me click's supposed to fry
Anybody kcuf 'cause I nosh to die
Bonzai, nigga everyone's high
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy mizzizy

[Verse 1: Don Juan]
A chin check, results of a slick neck
A representer of the midwest get wrecked
Like collisions, my provisions
Sharp enough to make incisions
Making killers bodies be coming up missing
Sweet relish, made from the drugs
Goodfellas, gangstas and thugs
These hoes wookin' pa nub
I show no love like Ike, you ain't seen a
Nigga become hype you play the role like Tina
Nothing but ass beatings, you're in pain, damaging to the brain you became an insane because the shit was trauma
We bring drama, murder like Jeffrey Dahmer
Psychotic, hypnotic, can't stop but my style a brain bomber
So I'ma release, my anger, fuck peace
Bring the danger, they Hitler of rap, enemies in my gas chamber
Puff like [?], two Glocks on my hips
Fire shots just in case these niggas wanna trip
Five Six, my mix Don Juan brings the fury
Makin' dash To L.A., from Cali to Missouri
Mizzizy get's Bizzy, [?] the most is very tricky
But hickeys on my dickies they quickie's have left the bitches dizzy
To them hoes pleasing [?] The Don Brasco
I be the man because I'm macho
Enough to make the whole crowd duck
Let the gauge buck, shots rang out
Your brains hang out, niggas don't give a fuck 'cause uh

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
We Mizzizy living eye for eye
Dem who diss me click's supposed to fry
Anybody kcuf 'cause I nosh to die
Bonzai, nigga everyone's high
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy mizzizy

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I, the angel of rap, say pack yo shit
Look back at the mic, and turn brick Bloods n' Crips to clips
The city is cool, we 'bout to make the plates shift
When floatin' ya open, and Mizzery is on Tech, I Pac a flips
You ready for demons creep 'n' roam in through your homes
Is you got the stomach for blown domes?
Turn me on, I'm in a zone
Medusa looked at us and said "wassup?!"
The Midwest stared back and plus
Now that bitch stuck as kcuf
Gimmie that fo' fo', fillin' that 9-millimeter gun bust
I'ma get 'em with a flow, just a little bit a mo'
My foursome like Michael, a psycho approach
I rage most, rollin' like the Stagecoach
Givin' the K.O
Swollen pockets, but robbin' on Roe Dayo
I'm very krueger
If you hurt my love I'm breakin' out the scary rooga
When I get ta bustin', that's my free Larry Hoova, maneuver
Who's a rapper, Yakuza, whacker than any
You loose'a, rap or refuse'a, ac'a like emmy
Rock so vest, we got yo checks, who jocks yo flexs?
You heathen thinkin' of a gettin' richer receivin' taco neck
The bigga the flow-a, the bigger the kill
The bigga the Fo' Fo' the bigga the pack'a niggas runnin' down the hill
Rogue Dog rule, we told y'all foo's
Now it's time to kill, haters just chill and peel the lyrical Benadryl
I can not, and shall not, and will not fall!
The opposite of Rue Paul, the Rogue Dog bustin' all'a y'all!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
We Mizzizy living eye for eye
Dem who diss me click's supposed to fry
Anybody kcuf 'cause I nosh to die
Bonzai, nigga everyone's high
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy mizzizy

[Ad-libs]
Yeah, it don't stop, it don't quit
Kicking that shit
Don Juan, MidWestSide
Let's take a ride to the MidWestSide

45 up, ain't nobody live up
Me and 57 perfect [?]
45 up, ain't nobody live up
Me and trouble life [?]

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
We Mizzizy living eye for eye
Dem who diss me click's supposed to fry
Anybody kcuf 'cause I nosh to die
Bonzai, nigga everyone's high
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
(Bounce) Mizzizy, get bizzy, get bizzy, mizzizy
