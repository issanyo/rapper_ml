[Intro]
What!
This is dedicated to the young gang niggas on 56th and
Highland
Nigga
Get yo money fool, yeah
Dont ever let them niggas tell you that they better
Than you man
It's all delicious, like this

[Verse 1]
'Til you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
While you on your Caribbean cruise
I'm payin' my dues
On the corner tryin' to hit licks for slips
Trouble making them flips
So I'm 'bout to smoke a dipped
Now I'm ripped
How could you make a hypothesis on me and my partnas?
With your college degree trying to psycho-analyze me
You can't see what I see, you can't be what I be
When I'm deep in this pit of violence without parental guidance, nigga
Spot, translation cops watching me every day when I'm
Just holding down my block, fuck a ad-hoc
My brother, My fathers' in jail, momma fell
So I'm 'bout to make a sell, what the hell?
Gotta get that rel and then I bail
I smell like Sherman, you can tell
The chemicaly it got me wanted to use my genitalia
Up on this bitch, that bitch
The kind that don't want to bust a gang
Ain't got no love, so I'ma Just hit it and hope she
Don't give me what his name
Packs, me metal in case of emergencies, urgencies, urgencies
Bills I'm trying to hug
Still you trying to judge
Yelling out the federal prison
Boozy nigga you can cruise
'Til you walk these shoes, I'm living

[Chorus]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero

[Verse 2]
You're on the outside looking in my friend, I mean my foe
Come close and I'll be forced to let you know(what)
I'm living the life of a hustla
'Cause the schools done cut my visits down to zero just
For beating down a busta (it's a musta)
Keep lookin' at me like I'ma steal you wit an hour
And all you think I do is eat shit and shower
I'm a survivor
Present day McGyver
Two sider
You depriver
When you look at me you think I'm a conniver
What's happening
Breakin' you and your boy in a game of tennis
I'm a menace
You one of them people step into our sneakers a
Minute (nigga)
You hopped out the boots
Yelling when you see its hard finding work
Being a class A felon
Drug selling
Scrapping niggas from every side
Fighting family drunk and high
Ain't no punk in I
Domestic so I'm off to the penal again
So momma tell me how am I to reconcile again
Tell you walk these
Catch me in the smokers LeSabre
Running spock off on the block
Can't understand my behavior
I'm coocoo for cocoa
Selling but driven
So motherfucker you can cruise
'Til you walk these shoes, I'm living

[Chorus]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero

[Verse 3]
'Til you walk these
Only speak about what you know
'Til you walk these
Our record use these views to the floor
'Til you walk these
Pick a punk to verbally abuse
If you walk these
You couldn't walk a block in my shoes
Till you walk these
Don't preach to every nigga you choose
Till you walk these shoes
You couldn't understand my views
Wouldn't kiss me on your shoes if they were given
Motherfucker
You can cruise till you walk these shoes, I'm living

[Chorus]
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
In the ghetto, packs me metal
Pump this leado, take dinero
