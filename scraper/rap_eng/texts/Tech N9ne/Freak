[Intro: Wrekonize]
She said some crazy shit and I was like, you're a freak
Ha, freak, you heard me? You're a freak!

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
And I truly wanna come and see what make you tick
Thick hips and a pierced lip, let me dip quick
Shit, get this dick I'm gonna give
My mind, that's one hell of a grip
For a woman looking semi-innocent
You been waiting for the minute you could live
And get me all up in your liver and your ribs
This is not for the women talking bout a little romance
I mean the women not afraid to get both hands
Close and, down on a grown man
She got toys and the wax
All down to her back and her outfit - latex
But it's feeling quite dangerous
This ain't never really felt like safe sex
But we do it anyway, with a bit of Henny
Get a medic ready for the play, you're an outcast
I'm Vinny on the case
Would never diss on a Marisa Tomei
Get down, like I know you wanna wrassle
I'm livin' out my life never bashful
Give it to me with the lace and the tassles
And let 'em hate, tight lippin' assholes
Give me a safe word, it's picnic
Tie you up and give me the jailbird, my hitlist
Needs you to get this, sick shit
Right up from the gutter bring another for the L-word
Take a breath, and I'm gonna accept
Your best bet is to blow my mind
Could put your back out, but I'm sick of that route
I'mma have you tryin' to get up with a broken spine

[Hook: Wrekonize]
And everywhere that we go
You're never fittin' in with all the regular folks
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You got your bad habits, but I ain't mad at it
Some people don't feel right being that average
You're a freak, you're a freak, you're a
You're a freak

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hella pale like Twilight, had to get her up
Into my room and give her my bite
When the sky's bright, she never deny pipe
But we get really horny lovin' and fly by night
She so like a freakshow, other people
Speak no, peace show full of ego
She so, like a d-bro, with her V though
That'll have a nigga weak in the P, bro
Everywhere we go people spot us
They yelling (You're a freak)
But I love it, she's beautiful
Rough and rugged, you're a keep
And when I put it up inside of her
She say to me (You're a freak)
Cause when I'm bangin' inside her ways
I'll be in it balls deep
If you want this thing and
You ain't trippin' that, you bloody (You're a freak)
If you like to put yourself
Where she be muddy, you're a creep
If you want me to stick it between your boobies
When you're lickin' it (You're a freak)
If you want me to be normal
Stiff and formal, then you're a geek
Invite them all, and I pipe with all, of my might
I'mma be a fright to y'all, cause I bite the broads
And I knife them all in my sight
Never be ordinary, stick the more the merry
Go that far, we stay cray
Everyone look at you stupid
When you're an F-R-E-A-K

[Hook]
