[Verse 1]
I been a killer in the game when I first put the pen to the pad like your first day out
N9ne be a thriller wit' the thang when I spurt suck 'em in with the gab in a verse they shout
Like when all the people at the church play Crouch
When you're pornographic and the Kirk spray out
On a workday couch and divert they spouse at the house
My residue on her birthday blouse!
What I hear out here is not stunnin'
Sound like y'all disregarded what Biggie and Pac brung in
But me I been rippin' shows havin' the thots summoned
When I took my dick out of the equation
Yo they stopped comin'!
'Bout ta flow tonight
Am I gonna be spitting wickedness? Sho' ya right!
Vulgar like Dolemite not runnin' fo' the light
Poltergeist, roll the dice
You're gonna find I'm the business when I hold the mic
Know the fright, N9cian out wrap you chicken's Qdoba like
Vive la Tech, N9na the vet
Everyone knowin' that he so ballsy
Diva ya get, eager ta let
All of us hit because we so saucy
Deeper the press, the weaker ya set
They cannot fathom how we so
Maude Khalifah the best
Peak of the nest
That is the reason why people call me

[Chorus]
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E

[Verse 2]
Ain't no way you get around it
There's no taking away my seat
I'm chosen, right hand on my crotch
It'll let you know ain't nothing weak
I'm holding snakes and the bats around my neck
They be like my flows I keep 'em frozen
Chopping away you wack ass rappers
N9na be leaving 'em decomposing
I can demolish all of 'em, that's my sales pitch
One monkey done stopped the show, I'm from the Zou, I can smell shit
They wanna get violent 'cause their ladies really want my male stick
But I never cooperate with a thot to mate so you fail bitch
Superhero to boost the ego
I eat up any rapper like I do chorizo
I'm taking what I got and give it to the Migos
To woo the people get through to Ebro
Superpowers I'm possessing it
Tech is if nothin' written on my check is a deficit
Dumping diction down a dungeon is a definite
Rock the red on my red and I'm reppin' it
Got a problem with it blood, there is the bait
We soldiers living in this country and well aware of your hate
This country from the jump ain't nothing but terror mistake
So I think that hat would've been a good thing if it said
Make America great, my name is

[Chorus]
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E

For short, you can call me N9na!
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E
For short, you can call me N9na!
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E
T-E-C-H-N-9-N-E
Yeah!

[Outro]
Yeah N9na, you tell 'em, you sell 'em
Real shit, ill spit, mill ticks, to deal with, let's go
Ayy, oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh, ayy, oh
Welcome to the motherfucking show
