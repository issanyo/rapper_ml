[Intro: JL]
Man, it gotta be like Saturday or some shit
Feel too good
B. Hood

[Verse 1: JL]
Woke up feeling good had to thank God
Today gon' be a good day
Smile on my face that I can’t hide
Feelin' bad in a good way
Got a call from my nigga Tech N9ne
He said tell ‘em B. Hood Jay later
On the shindig is at the crib come by
Let’s get high
Let’s get drunk like the hood say
Butt naked bonin’ makin' breakfast in the kitchen [Zoo shit]
Buckets like I’m balling
Bitches beautiful
What part of "on the menu” didn’t hear you wouldn’t listen [Two Shit]
Work hard, play harder homie
Yes you should do what I'ma player on, pimp I’m playin' my position
Hit the bourbon and rip an irremovable nigga
I do not see any key in the ignition
Get the Caribou lou know when we do the usual
No bitches be thirsty
What is this Thursday?
Every day the blood run, busy doin' the dirty
Everything is glamorous, Ludacris and Fergie
Smokin' so much cannabis we forget, where were we?
Mama don’t worry, I’m in no hurry
Tell me I’m a king and every woman unworthy
But I swear to God they wouldn’t find a fuck if they searched me
Bitches couldn't get my number like they hung up my jersey
Sprite, lemon and Hennessy
Hump like a Wednesday
Pull up to the show and have ‘em all in a frenzy
Motherfuckers acting like they know like Mackenzie
But I cannot find your face in any place in my memory
What you want me to say man?
What was your name again?
Gave me your information, I forgot to savor that
Campaignin’ I’ve been kissing babies and shakin' hands
High on a low my nigga I did not take the stands
But wait a minute

[Hook: Marley Young]
I don’t know what day it is
Every day I wake up, feel like a Sunday
Don’t even tell me no
I go get that money like Monday
As soon as she told me
I got that chain like a Friday
But why did we score like the Wednesday
Never even left out the driveway
Must be a Saturday
My bitch got me j's like it’s Saturday
Must be a Saturday
My nigga get ripped every Saturday
Must be a Saturday
They phone off the rip like it’s Saturday
Yeah must be a Saturday
We drinkin' by ten on a Saturday

[Verse 2: The Popper]
Ledo, a hangover ‘cause it’s a Sunday
I post a pic, country view smash down the one-way
I wish all my people would chill with the gunplay
Our maker, the reaper, you will meet him one day
Monday is here so I check my agenda
Hit up doctor Marvis for a fender bender
This girl she all on me, cancel that dinner
It’s chilly, that’s how I see I trap in September
I act to vash paper
I keep all my dues paid
Tacos with sour cream, gotta be Tuesday
Mind it, oh mama, see that is a usual
My colour-coat popped up I have to drop you ways
Looked at my Facebook, they say that it’s hump-day
All in my DM say she want to hump me
I’m at my loft, she has two, I woke up there
I told her “It’s cool, but don’t snapchat in front of me
Every day I rap Kansas City up
Thursday, one third, this is strict give me crispy cuts
When I’m in a little-ittle-bitty rut
Hit me on the phone, say your prayer’s gonna lift me up
Giddy-up cause it’s Friday
Saucy like walked out of Jimmy Dee’s
O2 on my way
Ain’t talkin' bout jogging when my goons say 5K’s
Mobbin' like C-Bo
Skyways on highways
I stay where people camp out for them Jordans
I got a plug, go see Rick in the morning
We building a bridge see the network is forming
This Saturdays poppin' and yes I’m performing
The doorman give all of us VIP
I use my face card so don’t need to see ID
Masterin' shit talking, that’s my degree
I be tell the DJ play some 2Pac or B.I.G

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
See I be ready to get loose on a Saturday
Nigga that’s my cheat day
Drankin' like a relay
Take a look at me, I never been no saint as in Latter-day
Drunk on the freeway
Don’t matter to me, hey
It’s Saturday

[Hook: Marley Young]
I don’t know what day it is
Every day I wake up, feel like a Sunday
Don’t even tell me no
I go get that money like Monday
As soon as she told me
I got that chain like a Friday
But why did we score like the Wednesday
Never even left out the driveway
Must be a Saturday
My bitch got me j's like it’s Saturday
Must be a Saturday
My nigga get ripped every Saturday
Must be a Saturday
They phone off the rip like it’s Saturday
Yeah must be a Saturday
We drinkin' by ten on a Saturday
