[Verse 1]
Wake up in the morning with my better half
On a boat lift the covers and I pet her ass
Never know when I gotta go cause my life is impossible
The way I'm livin' the good things never last
So I live for the minute just want to start to begin it
When I wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
20,000 people they yellin' feedin' my ego
When it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'
Double-O Nina, known for dippin'
From place to place I gotta vacate the mission
Gotta get the money but what do you know I wake up
In a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
Hollywood movie with the Jackass cats
I close my eyes I open 'em and I'm back at rap
In the studio collabin' killin' wack ass crap
But then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap
In the club cause some other niggas want my head
I don't know too much about 'em but they won't buy red
I ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me
Wake up again I'm a DJ Clue party
With Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross
Cat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a quatro, triple, double agent

[Hook]
(Double-O Nina) Where I'm bout to go I don't even know
(Double-O Nina) In a place where almost anything goes
(Double-O Nina) Many roads when I travel is what I chose
(Double-O Nina) Where I'm living I really got to many roads

[Verse 2]
Me had a lot of women but them need me
Wake up tryin' to hide it but sin sees me
Overseas nigga tryin' to begin freaky
Wake up at the award at MTV, you
Then I stab it at you, wake up
I'm back at Missou and I get to mackin' a few
After the yak I take 'em back to the sack and I screw
Scat then back to the lab I got some rappin' to do
Then I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues
This characteristic is made to slay crews
Some tryin' to get at me to battle but they lose
Then I'm wakin' up with my kids on a paid cruise
They callin' me daddy, wake up in a strip club
They callin' me daddy, man I'm goin' hella baddy
Amazing, life's hella crazy
Livin' like I'm a cuatro, triple, double agent

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
At any rate I'm all over the place
Music and being a father and I know that I made
Got me feelin' moon stricken but Nin' remain calm
Livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond
Switchin', changin', feelin', Strangin'
Livin' multiple lifes, robbin' and gangbangin'
Freakin' all over the world Middle West swangin'
Always on the move ain't never time for hangin'
Slick with my shit my grip don't fold
Pick the fly chicks and ditch those hoes
Kiss for my bitch my kids get dough
Ripping my scripts I hits this road
Double-O Nina nigga I love this grind
Doing a lot of good and mud this time
Dippin' all over the planet
Tellin' the bitches my name is N9ne, (Grr) Tech N9ne!

[Hook]
