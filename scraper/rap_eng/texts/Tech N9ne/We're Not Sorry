[Bridge: Mackenzie Nicole]
I put my best foot forward
I keep my family by my side
I sleep with one eye open

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I'm for real when I say I got an army
Stand down if you think you can harm me
Think about the war you'll be starting
Come for my people, you'll be sorry
We're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
So called Christians, what do they do?
They label me evil
Man you don't know just how crazy these people
So many conspiracies they get from hearing me
Fearing me 'cause they think that I'm the tyranny of Devilry
Think they planning to level me
'Cause I'm king of the revelry
I will never be taken by the hands of another man
I get grim like no other can
Christian household my mother ran, in this gutter land
Then she married a good Muslim brother man
So I had a hell of a lot of teaching
We leave sin on the table with the goodness and feasting
Eating like cannibals we're the animals beasting
Seeking the enemy who invented these preachings

[Bridge: Mackenzie Nicole]
I put my best foot forward
I keep my family by my side
I sleep with one eye open
Pray you'll stay right by me and my (Love!)

I'm for real when I say I got an army

'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I'ma say this quick
If you come for me and my family, I'ma spray this clip
And my army is super ready if you haters trip
Keep popping off at the mouth, you get inflated lips
Ain't no Illuminati, don't let the ruckus consume ya body
I'ma groom the shotty then I'ma aim it at whom is naughty
With them damning me to hell, planning for me to fail
Ain't no landing me in cells, abandoning me in jail
Stop mocking me and my symbols
Back in the day was bishop, more, and me in the temple
So if you coming at me I will never be gentle
You gotta know ya conspiracy theories are mental
Me and my children breathing that is really essential
So me just being a rapper is not my only potential
Was brought up in a war, you can check my credentials
All I gotta do is tell my army come and let the sin flow
They see tenfold

[Bridge: Mackenzie Nicole]
I put my best foot forward
I keep my family by my side
I sleep with one eye open
Pray you'll stay right by me and my

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I'm for real when I say I got an army

Come for my people, you'll be sorry
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry
So think about the war that you'll be starting
'Cause we're not sorry, we're not sorry
