I'm two up
Well ain't that right
Well it would've back then, then you screwed up
Well ain't that right
You should know that we were made for this
Well ain't that right
The "how it going?", that the way it is
Are you in the game, check
Strange, check
Make the competition take a rain check
This, check
This, check
This ain't just for the fame, check
We don't roll with no lames, check
This, check
This, check
This, check
Ride with us or you ride against us

[Verse 1: JL]
All real niggas in agreement
At a certain level of achievement
It get difficult for you to decipher who deviant
And who only wanna be around when it's convenient
It would seem to me I'm succeeding or either seein' shit
Nothin' to better, to regret and nothin' to reason
Lost my mind, I lost a lot to stick the dreams, spend
A lot of my time tryin' to find what to lead the scenes with
Now that them up
When you're workin' get your collatoral up
Prestige, esteem, position, my stature is up
Two brackets above them breaking but distracted enough
Don't give half of a fuck, were fragile when the gavel is struck
By your maggot-bashin' too passionate, I'm 'bout to pull up
I'm too radical, flashes of dramatic capital
Cut out the lagger, never have me in black and actin' a nut
Say what you said again, you 'bout to do what?
Nigga I'm

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I been a ripper since I begun
I set out to demolish rappers, killing niggas for fun
So you know that my younger nigga J, is a bigger gun
50 caliber rip it outta ya wit' the flip of the tongue, we the ones
We the ichiban
I make the bitches wanna hit thee Don
When I'm sickly I'm givin' the stiffy to ditzy blondes
Even thicky bronze never do want me wit' dickies on
Nigga, Pippi Longstockings was jocking the Jimmy John (Jimmy John's haha)
Speaking of sandwiches I am famished, it can damage shit
Jam it 'til every fan of his vanishes a banishment
And I get manic with this on cannabis, no panic, its advantage is slammin' amateurs plan ya bitch!
Soo Woo's us (but)
Ain't nobody trippin' and tryna shoot us
Wit' the Ruger, I'm not a loser
I'm Michael Myers, who the fuck is Jason and Krueger
Nigga, I'm (two up)
