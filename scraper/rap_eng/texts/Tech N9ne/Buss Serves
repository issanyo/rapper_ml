[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Started with the blow and went to flows
Listen to me tell my gutter story and it goes

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
When I was nineteen, I went to go live with my auntie
And noticed she had nice things, the furniture and
All of her clothes quite clean to never be working a 9 to 5
She ran a ice cream, team
She put me on, am I wit' it Simon?
Stay remarkably grown, that's why my pockets be long
Ducked some feds, dumped packs, and then got custom threads
From serving boofas in KC we say let's buss some heads, nigga
In French village, I went 'til it, got the rent bill it
Got so heavy I no longer benched skrilla was a cinch still I had to Vince Neil it
Yell in a microphone and write them songs they like it's on
I let go they life worth of pipe is blown to flowing ignite my home I used to buss serves, now I buss words
Either way slanging or sanging whatever life I'ma just splurge
We had the spot though until it really got hot so
Escape I did like El Chapo
But Nueve still get faded, vato

[Hook: Young Devi D and Tech N9ne]
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
(Young nigga chasing that bag)
I pull up bussin' serves
Young nigga pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
On my mama nigga
Pull up, I'm bussin' serves
But you won't find me nickel and diming, man I'm off the curb
Prolly find me somewhere rhyming man this flow's absurd
Or maybe find me on my grinding where the pot is stirred
Either way I'm bout my pay I'm tryna stack up my dollars
Ripping the chowder, stomping the powder, dumping it louder, soldier for louder
Necked it to a vato
Jefe, head honcho
El Chapo with the hot flows
Still logged in with the block though
Hit a thang and make the knot grow
Push a nigga push it all bro
Pussy pills to that Pablo
In dark or night nigga I glow
Old nigga with the bag bro
Silly nigga with the mag though
Be careful what you pussies ask for
I'm airing out one of you assholes
Real shit, but the paper quit when the violence hit, nigga beep it bool
Shit bricks and quick licks turned meal ticks, nigga beep it bool
Out here hungry chasing food
All in, refuse to lose
Bussin' serves or bussin' words, ask about me, I'm that dude

[Hook: Young Devi D and Tech N9ne]
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
(Young nigga chasing that bag)
I pull up bussin' serves
Young nigga pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves

[Verse 3: Young Devi D]
I got my mind on my money, money on my mind
It's just something about them hundreds
When you thumbing through them signs
I quit fucking with them niggas, 'cause they ain't wan' shine
And that's all I'm tryna do, it's why I grit, it's why I grind
I pull up bussin' serves nigga all at the trailer parks
I talk money fluent, they ain't teach it in language arts
And that nigga street smart, reflex razor sharp
Don't fall in love with me baby, I'm just gon' break your heart
Smash through the sheet like the fucking Transporter
I got film of your bitch on my camcorder
Had to show it to my homies, this right here my life mane
Hit a lick for 30, lost 20 in the dice game
Fuck it man it's nothing, I swear to God it's nothing
I tried to down that sucker but I paralyzed his cousin
Oops fuck it, oops fuck it
That come with the pop-off
You my son's son lil nigga, call me papa

[Hook: Young Devi D and Tech N9ne]
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
I pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves
(Young nigga chasing that bag)
I pull up bussin' serves
Young nigga pull up, pull up
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves, commas
Either way I'ma be stacking it
On my mama
Making my milli from rapping it or
Bussin' serves
