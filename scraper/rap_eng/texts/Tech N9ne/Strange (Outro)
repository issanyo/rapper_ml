[Intro: Krizz Kaliko] (x4)
Strange Music!

[Verse: J.L. of B. Hood]
Repping, can't act as if it wasn't true
The fact is it just had to happen
Crept into the back and hacked into the stu-
-Dio session  and I slay what Seven sent me
They gon' have to let me through
Let 'em react like this is something new
What you think, I don't do this shit for Zoo?
Overdo this and my whole city  wanna see
Others look at me like, "Oh, he's the one, is he?"
Bitches hit me up like, "You need some company"
I could be at 'em like two to three once a week
Come up and at it and ain't nothing fucking free
Assumptively it's time to up the fee
Momma questioning what I would grow up to be
Tryna get in and got everything but the key
Hard work and dedication, nigga
Hear the passion in my conversation with ya
Put the hate away and come and take this picture
Think it's safe to say, it's what the faith will get ya
Sippin' sake, share the celebration with ya
Pick who sit beside me play no babysitter
Sick as ever, make a way to get to where the money is
I'm able Jay da table fixer
Been impatient taking sedatives
Ever since I been chopping up these messages
Always been light years ahead of this
Ready for fucking bread is where my fetish is
I know that enough it never is
And because of what I wrote I'm where the letter header is
Brotherhood forever my brother forever missed
Never let a bitch discredit what I said it is
DIBKIS, nigga!
