[Intro]
And just when they thought that everything was peachy keen
Somewhere deep within the shadows
There were other things to be seen
An untamable beast with an urge to feast
And only alone would he stand, the culprit of fear on the 67th tier
There lies the Boogieman

[Verse 1]
No introduction needed
N9ne times you must repeat it
Mind tryin’ to just delete it
I'm N9ne supposed to be this rough MC
Whose gluttony would rhyme grime
Trust, believe it

A legend ever since the projects
A odd tech would get respect
When he wreck the set but never get the props
That was god blessed
So this is me, never lettin’ the crowd rest
The object of rawness
Dejected steps to darkness

Led to the industry whispering the name
History became a mystery
Cause listeners in the game
Wish ta sing the same
Riffs, cerebral glitch will lead to lame
And this will be your pit
For me to split and bleed your brain

They heard the name
But can't put a face with it
Oh what a shame
When it rains in the woods he stands still
He turns to lanes
From sane to straight wicked
Don't tell me you ain’t heard the sayin’
“The Boogieman’s real”

[Hook]
He's underneath your bed
Trapped inside your head
You try to fight it
But you decide it's just that
Boogieman

We fear what we can't see
This web’s a tangled weave
Life designed you
To try and blind you
From that Boogieman

And in that voice you hear
'Eliminate your fears'
What do you do?
Discover the truth
That it’s the Boogieman

And now you know it's real
And everything you feel
Hits you again, you will stand
Face-to-face with that
Boogieman

[Verse 2]
They don't wanna have to try to do as I do
That's probably why it ain’t been easy for me to slide through
I chew rappers up, on stage and they’re like fly-flew
Out with the ravens, flight to hatin’, haven lies you

Cause you don't want change
And you don't want strange
Rearranging the main lanes to brain games from plain jane
That's when your fame’s Strange
And you can’t maintain
You think you sang such an insane rain
Samethang

And I'm the shadow in the dark
That came for battlin’ the park
And they skidaddled when I barked
It gave a rattle to their hearts
Cause they're afraid they will all fail
Darkness will prevail
The Boogieman is not a tall tale

What a tough act to follow
You afraid? Tell me are ya?
When this came you were nada
Tell your lane ‘sayonara’

(The Boogieman, the Boogieman)

[Hook]
