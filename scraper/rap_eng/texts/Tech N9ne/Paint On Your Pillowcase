[Intro: Tech N9ne & Groupie]
Um, I normally don't do anything like this (mhm)
But, um when I saw you in the club
I just thought, I had to try something different! (mm hmm)
I normally don't take anyone home on the first night (mhmm)
But you look so, good to me
Shut Up, take off your clothes

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Lay down on the mother fucking bed, like I said
I'm a different kind of nigga, like to spread bloody red
From banging the thing I'm a tame when you shed naughty legs
I'm geekin'
'Cause you peakin' with my head
Leave you dead and leakin'
I'm a killer, but instead of a machete
I got my dick, I'ma drill her
Then I'ma wet her with the steady
A proper check up speedy
Like Andretti hit the crevi
A lot to pick up, Betty gotta be ready for the yetti
To eat, my kind of meat, find mine to feat
But climb N9ne the beast, It's my time to feast
Einstein N9ne slime the sheets
I’m tryna’ design prime dime schwan the beef
She whine the least
Rewind the beat 'cause T9 he grind the freaks
Puttin' your mother fuckin' feline to sleep
Cannibalistic with her I'm hoping she don't mind the teeth
You invited me in
Gimme the Henny, lemon and sprite and the night'll begin
You ignited me when you stated you sighted me when
I was painted up, said you came on up and want to be sin
'Til the morning light, it was on tonight
You met a DK-N to fuckin' bone you right
Clones'll roam you might, be surprised with the vibe
But I'm leavin' paint on your pillow meaning I was inside

[Tech N9ne]
Suck on me for 40 seconds underwater baby girl
And if you succeed, I'll extend the same to you

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Listen
I ain't finna seal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase

[Verse 2: Acie High]
I’m smooth nigga, live nigga, pimp nigga
When I told her when she asked 'bout my mo'fuckin' face paint
‘Cause bitch, it don’t matter what you think
When the drank, get up in your tank you won't say Ace Can’t
A little bicker and a little more, then slit her a little more
Liquor to get the whore, to straight skank
Fuck you because I do it with a little fluid
Later she gon' feel real stupid like a play prank
‘cause I know about the hole that was in her
Know she a sinner, oh, no beginner
Hungry ass ho went low for that dinner
Told that ho no, ‘cause my heart cold like winter
Yes, so, ‘cause she’s a freak, and ig'nant
Born the whore into streets that’s gettin’ it
One in four creeps just hittin' in, so I told the carnivore, eating my meat is a privilege
Can dick her down, dick her, dick her, dick her down
But if I dick her down, then a nigga will never get the crown
But if I get a picture wit her on that liquor lick her down
Then her lickin' down then she will never bring a nigga down
And her being a saint is erased, and the next day she’ll be in a tainted place
Some that she can’t escape, but I can, even with a trace of my painted face

[Ace High]
Aww boo don’t be afraid I’m not into making you naughty
It's just a joke, not a dick, so don't take it so hard, ha!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Listen
I ain't finna seal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
Paint on your pillowcase
We gon' drink 'til you can't feel your face
Then I'm leavin' paint on your pillowcase

[Verse 3: Aqualeo]
Lust - the sin that brought us all here
The one we love the most, but yet it's the one we all fear
Sometimes sadistic, it gets mystic and then trends are twisted
Bodies in exquisite positions, that’s so illicit
Illegal to exhibits, solicit, yet we exist
In a thrill and all sorts of feelin' we get, that’s so implicit
Why people riskin' their life, depinction husband's and wife
To get closer to the true wise that brings us eternal life
The paint left on your pillow, the stain from off the face
The one you see in your dreams when you’re achin' below the waist
The devil was given horns, but the nature from which was born
Every person that’s ever lived so give praise to the god of porn

[Outro: Priceless]
God didn't bring you here, the Devil did
Accept the nature you were created in

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Listen
I ain’t finna steal your fate
My aim is to kill your hate
We gon' drink 'til you can’t feel your face
Then I’m leavin' paint on your pillowcase
