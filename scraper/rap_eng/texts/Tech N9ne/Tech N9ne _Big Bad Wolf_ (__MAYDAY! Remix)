[Verse 1:Tech N9ne]
I'm giving 'em a dilemma
The coming of a killer, the phantom of all niggas who wanna be Ninna, But listen
I kill a bitch in a vision of "Milli-Vanilli"
Motherfuckers who's being murdered by the big bad wolf
Computer-ism I'll give em a... push
Ripped you and your mocking crew
What you gonna do when I pop at you, Glock at you
Fill em with the venom who the fuck are you talking to?
Betray me? you crazy! The Keyser Söze, Kevin Spacey
Niggas hate me, can't face me
Bitches like Cagney and Lacey, basically you can't ace me
I put that on school is the Lil' Tracey, ya better mace me, cause I'mma fuck up a niggas career
If you think you trying to bite me, taste me; listen to me
Like guerrilla monsoon I'mma a wolf, so I howl at the motherfucking moon
I can smell a rotten fella, cotton dwella; hella props to the jella, my nigga loom
Two little pigs niggas who wanted to be the Big Bad Wolf, Tecca Ninna clone
That's why this little piggy hit the carpet, and the other little piggy stayed home
Chrome huff and I'll puff
And I'll blow that fucking mic down and stuff
Hit me with a silver bullet and get it outta me
Cause a weak bullet is only a mini-technicality
Follow me nigga
If you gotta be Ninna to get a bigger salary, motherfucker
To bust flows like Joe's or like those
Who make relish and throw midwest blows at foes
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
(Say it again)
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
(One more time)
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
You being a bitch as in Brooke, you're nothing but a crook
So you niggas can't fuck with the Big Bad Wolf

[Hook:¡MAYDAY!]
Under the moon they try to hide
Under the surface in disguise
Sometimes i'm not sure i'm alive
At least until the red moon starts to rise
Under the moon they try to hide
Under the surface in disguise
Sometimes i'm not sure i'm alive
At least until the red moon starts to rise

[Verse 2:Wrekonize]
Ok, Big Bad Wolf with a terrible hunger
I split that fool with the head of a hunter
I'm the son of a son of a bitch, gonna' be running from this, humana humana it's time we wonder
How
Many more must die from this, this lonely death
The sky is oh so smokey yes
I'm eyeing my next broken guest
Kill 'em with a little bit of the quickness, the vicious fix this life of Strangers
You've been bitten on a minimal hit list, but fixes can't be done no saviors
Savor
The most sadistic of my flavors
I'll slice you all without a razor and take you to meet the man against your prayers, player
Break down he's a London monster, that gets way down when the hunger taunts him
I can't resist on the victims on an auction block, yes i want 'em, box em
Wait, watch 'em, that wolf will take your oxygen
He's angry got the Ox in him, you see his eyes, you don't talk to him
Sneak 'round town to get the crown now, but keep the sound down
Defeat the clowns wow, this evil I've found is another way to keep me out of these old grounds
So keep your silver bullets and your crosses tight
You'll need em if you want to cross the night and not be known as those who lost their life

[Hook:¡MAYDAY!]
Under the moon they try to hide
Under the surface in disguise
Sometimes i'm not sure i'm alive
At least until the red moon starts to rise
Under the moon they try to hide
Under the surface in disguise
Sometimes i'm not sure i'm alive
At least until the red moon starts to rise
