We are party people
We are what you call
Self made party monsters
So welcome to the bar

[Daddy X]
First of all I'd Like to welcome y'all
To the 13th annual Kottonmouth Ball
Round here anything goes
Whippies, Tippies, and Trickity Hoes
Bass tone, rattle ya bones
SC tabs and fat bong loads
Sun goes up and comes back down
Got a little bit of everything floating around

[The Dirtball]
We the Party Monsters setting the bar
Dedicated to substance abuse, take a whiff of my jar
It be the mix of a buncha different ways
To get down, cop a buzz, and then spray
Friends from the liquor that I'm poundin everyday
Right now, partied up on the way to the bar
So let's play
You take a shot, I take a shot, You take a shot, We take a shot
Hey

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Party Monsters, a special guest has just arrived
Please direct your attention to the red carpet
Here comes none other than the most sinister monster of them all, Tech N9ne!

[Tech N9ne]
All the home girls love me at Hooters
I'm straight Ã¼ber
Emcee searching for that cooter
They know my Roto-Rooter's
A straight shooter
So we dipping and she packing a fat booter
Baby all around the world I be hooting
Same time I be soozing out the ooshin
I mean ocean
I threw back a couple of cold ones
And I'm in motion
Party pulsing, then I'm poking
Tecca Nina gettin that loot that we rolla
Haters see me and they try to shoot, their Evola
Cause I got their women getting lose
Every ho I'm gettin wet cause I make them say, ooh Areola

[Hook x2]

[D-Loc]
Let's wreck this cuz y'all know we can
Pay time ballers, y'all get rap
Let's wreck this cuz y'all know we can
Pay time ballers, y'all get rap

[Johnny Richter]
Yell damn what the others say, hell yea
We could be the ones to bring the party back in here
So let the pace drop and the temperature rise
Tequila on your drinks vibratin' in your thighs
Kottonmouth Kings do this shit worldwide
See me on a plane moving Mile High
Eyes red as fuck and my shades no surprise
What'd you expect from this hell of a guy, hell of a guy

[The Dirtball]
You can't put your hands to the ceiling
Everybody party hard, don't fight the feelin'
I'mma put it out there and I can party harder than y'all
Bring in heat to the brawl, I'mma monster

[Johnny Richter]
Now we are the people that's controlling the wheel
And we are the people that be makin' the deals
Yes, we are the people that be up in the hills
Tryin' to put the mushrooms psychedelic appeal
I'm Johnny Richter, I'm the King of the Block
I got a seven fold band and a twelve week stop

[Bridge]
Right about now I show an extra special chunk of respect
To the monster making all this debauchery possible
The host of the party, the extraordinary Daddy X

[Daddy X]
Be wrecked in my brain, high on cocaine
Having more pills and drinking champagne
Smoking that weed, chewin' on 'shrooms
I gotta few issues that I need to work through
Nobody's perfect, we all got faults
I love loose women and old school cars
Close down bars and sleep past two
There's a killer on the loose and the beat goes boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

[The Dirtball]
Y-y-you can find me blazed out with my homies
They got up in the back, all the bitches know me
Flex all them in the flash we'll be cold flockin'
[Incomprehensible]
All out, all in, yeah, yeah, I had it again
Nobody fuckin' with the powers of the crown, the skin
You tougher than Teflon, you're fighting the wind
Then there was a pressed on to make your head spin

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let's wreck this shot
Let's wreck this shot
Let's wreck this shot
Let's wreck this shot
