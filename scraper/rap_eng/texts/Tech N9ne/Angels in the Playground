[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Hearing angels in the playground
Took some time to figure out
Gots to be yours
Yeah, I'm talking to you now
Though you're not aloud
Still be hearing ya, your voice

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
Time never gave us
No my daddy wasn't famous
Bout a thousand miles between us
Didn't let go until he seen us
It's a bittersweet melody
As I go and I'm spreading his legacy
I said it brings out the better me
But I could feel your spirit, I hope it never leaves
I got a home
See sometimes in life I'm walking feeling lonely
I got some answers that I'm seeking you would know it
And I would trade it all if I could get a moment
With you

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Angels in the playground
Took some time to figure out
Gots to be yours
Yeah, I'm talking to you now
Though you're not aloud
Still be hearing ya, your voice

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Didn't really wanna talk about it cause if people laughed and told me I was crazy it would make me act so violently
Cause when mama chose a cloud to flee
That night I saw the moon smile at me
At first I thought I'm going crazy
Then the smile got bigger and I felt that pretty lady's
(spirit spirit spirit spirit spirit spirit) now it's with me daily
Now I can feel that extra energy when the motion light Comes on inside my closet that don't hinder me
Cause I'm hoping what I'm finna see
Gonna be my mama not the enemy

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Energy never dies, it transfers
Can you tell him extra I got mine and I am hers
No longer a damper with God it's no slanders
But I wish I could see her again
Try to peek in heaven for a gander
And tell her thank you
For putting a name to this twisted brain
You always remain true
Now that your pains through
My dreams came true
And yes I blame who?
Her middle name Sue
And the song stopped
And now I look at life another way now
People need each others help to love, no need to stay frown
First I thought my mother's death would cease forever laid down
She's with me for real the globe is now my angel's playground, yeah

[Hook: Stevie Stone]

[Verse 4: Krizz Kaliko]
See, you've given me life
I can't repay you but I
Keep singing praise, I mean
All the way up to you
I wish that I could say what's up to you
I feel a spirit and it must be you
I know that spirits (sprit spirit spirit) must be real (spirit spirit spirit)
See there's no other way to explain what I feel
