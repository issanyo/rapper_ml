[Hook: Rajeo]
Man they call me the shooter
Bite and I bark
Full clip when I spark
Man they call me the shooter
Never missed a mark
For my team I go hard
Man they call me the shooter
On the block after dark
Catch me on the boulevard
Man they call me the shooter
Yelling woop when I chop 'em down
Quentin Tarantin' when I'm bussing rounds
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Nina repping one mob
Am I the one to be flipping it? (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Spitting the gift with the quick and original Gunga
This shooter gets gudda from hits to you
But that don't mean that I won't put clips through ya
I'm a shit fueler, unfuckwithable
Not too many rappers really wanna come buss with a bro
Stuck in a flow everybody does mean it so simple
Pencil weed sucks when ya go
See your lady watching when I get to chopping
She be jocking, want to give me all of it
I know it's shocking when the peep be popping
When she see me rocking nigga that is with a balla get used to cooda
Tryna get with the ruler from Kansas city Mizzou onto Aruba
Man they call me the shooter

[Hook: Rajeo]
Man they call me the shooter
Bite and I bark
Full clip when I spark
Man they call me the shooter
Never missed a mark
For my team I go hard
Man they call me the shooter
On the block after dark
Catch me on the boulevard
Man they call me the shooter
Yelling RIP when I chop 'em down
Quentin Tarantin' when I'm bussing rounds
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh!

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
I'm a motherfucking shooter
We slide on niggas like Uber
I kept on smoking the hookah
Knock niggas out they pumas
I'm a motherfucking shooter
Like stormtroopers the mask on
Strapped chrome
Waitin' in the bushes bring ya ass home
Nigga I'm a shooter
Sniping niggas with military issues
Quentin Tarantino, the murder scene is so official
When I'm gracing a pistol
Bullets whip through your tissue
Runners whip up your vest
Them hitters comin' to get you
Feel it

[Hook: Rajeo]
Man they call me the shooter
Bite and I bark
Full clip when I spark
Man they call me the shooter
Never missed a mark
For my team I go hard
Man they call me the shooter
On the block after dark
Catch me on the boulevard
Man they call me the shooter
Yelling RIP when I chop 'em down
Quentin Tarantin' when I'm bussing rounds
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh!

[Verse 3: Layzie Bone]
Young and Ruger with the beam
Number one shooter on the team
Snatching your future and your dreams
Nigga I come through like a marine
Sell them same nicotine
Everything green give me the cream
That's how we do it
From Oakland to Cleveland that's a regime
Burner for the '99 eternal
Call me the boss, call me the colonel
Got the heaters pop like an inferno
We smoke a lot in the circle
Homie the houses where I stay
Bone thug niggas with purpose
Fuck these verses, we gon' spray

[Hook: Rajeo]
Man they call me the shooter
Bite and I bark
Full clip when I spark
Man they call me the shooter
Never missed a mark
For my team I go hard
Man they call me the shooter
On the block after dark
Catch me on the boulevard
Man they call me the shooter
Yelling RIP when I chop 'em down
Quentin Tarantin' when I'm bussing rounds
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, oh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh!
