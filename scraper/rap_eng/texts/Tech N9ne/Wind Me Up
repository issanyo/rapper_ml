Momma just wind me up

And your ass crack showin'
At the supermarket

Cause your nipples be showin'
In the wife beater you wearin'
Damn! Come on over hear babydoll
I can tell you had a long hard day at the mall
Damn! I think I know just what will relax you
A long hard this in your that, you little brat you

[Hook: Jahred]
Uh, you know I'm inebriated
So punk rock, just let the haters hate it
Uh, and she's the fornicator
So punk rock, just let the haters hate her
Uh, yes I'm the violator
One rude boy, I'll show you what I'm made with
Uh, yes I'm the terminator
So punk rock, just let the haters hate

[Verse 2: Daddy X]
Let 'em hate, Let 'em hate
First rate pimp head in class of the state
You know the name triple X rated
Sex pistols, pistol whip the player haters
Presidential the residental wrecker
A king crown a queen like sex game of checkers
I decsend from the mothership of pleasure
Alien sex be supreme bed wetter
I got my lady doin summersaults and back flips
It's like a circus oley on my mattress
Stone cold fox she's the main attraction
Always climaxing constant satisfaction
That's why I deliver multiples
Old school fool gotta work it like a power tool
You need a sex fix? Call daddy X bitch
I'll hook you up on some new and a poop dick

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne
Thick ass bitches, wind me up
I hear they got a class for punani, sign me up
My homies call me punani Donnie cause I grind the gut
But I it wrap so that she have trouble tryin to find me nut
I'm a freak, yup, I hit and I ain't even speak
She called the bakers a dream maker
Now we in the sheets doin deep
She like dark meat in her cheeks
Wanna creep with a beast with a sweet little peice
Just wind me up and I'm the enegizer bunny work it out
But she want me face to go right below her tummy
Just wind me up, I'll take a gander for millions
And maybe I can get kinky with amber badillion
Yes, yes and that's finely cut
It's natural no need to line me up so just what just wind me up
You like it doggy I'm behind the butt
Don't you be sleepin on the nine you fucked
So what's up? Say what

[Pre-Hook and Hook]

[Verse 4: Johnny Richter]
The whole crowd froze when she enter the room
The baddest bitch I've ever seen yo I had to make a move
I played it cool rolled up on her like whats crackin
Five minutes later had her fallin over laughin
Or should I say giggling like a little girl
Lickin her lips while she playin with her curls
Spittin game in her ear only speakin the truth
If I say I turn you out that's what the fuck I'm gonna do
The freak was fine and I had to have a taste
Body good for straight fuckin with an innocent face
So sweet when she spoke yo I wasn't prepared
Cause on the way to my place she started giving me head
I almost crashed when I blasted her mouth
And when we got to the house she broke out some outfits
Dressed up like a nurse and she sucked my dick
Up to the cab in the mornin yo and that was it
