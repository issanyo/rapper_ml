[Verse 1: Info Gates]
Flicking ash out the back of the black limo
My chick looking deadly like a black widow
If any pussy boy come attack Info
I'm coming back with some shit to make his back limbo
The kush Colorado but the bar's MO
The Henny bottle's posted in the car mellow
Clepto, take it then off they go
I want that all night sex, then want that all day dough
In the case that you ain't know
Killer City, MO, where they flowing professional
Ain't no second guessing no question the six seconds then go
Look out below
Bras' flying as if he Kaliko
True, like I know you see me in the video
Every little itty bitty inch of the city I know
And I know it's hard to believe but I'm so winning
I'm a contradiction I'm pro women and pro pimping

[Hook: Info Gates]
Coming 'round the corner so fast, tires screeching
Bet you lose attention if you ever try to reach him
Bet you lose your vision if you ever try peeking
We on that good good up in the limousine geekin'

[Verse 2: Info Gates]
Sipping 'nac in the back of the Snoop DeVille
My girl got it going, aw she cute for real
Some people throwing shade but they stupid still
So I don't ever really trip on how they choose to feel
I hear somebody's voice say that Gates is whack
My first instinct is give his face a smack
But nah, you right, gesundheit
Mega fast, props, take 'em back like in Caddyshack on the Betamax
Facts, Bo Jax's breaking backs
Midtown diplomats
Giving tips of the caps but never tipping the cops
Never trumping and never grabbing no chick in the crotch
I'm an old chip off the block (What up!)
Who see Gates jeffing and I ain't got no time to play
I ain't got the time today if I did I'd have found a way
To hit this hide away with my [?] you vagina face
Andale, andale, right away I got that ride away

[Hook: Info Gates]
Coming 'round the corner so fast, tires screeching
Bet you lose attention if you ever try to reach him
Bet you lose your vision if you ever try peeking
We on that good good up in the limousine geekin'

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
It's the N9ne and I'm speaking
Just designed a new speech when
I put this time and then pieced in
Who digs this rhyming, now she friend
Then I get to sliming her reekin'
I keep that wine and I'm beasting
Tech be shining, I'm [?]
Clip that vine and I'm cheefing
Hip-hop done brought me from a metro bus to a black limo
Lyrically knocking rappers out like I was the rap Kimbo
Rep Kansas City round the MO, who's drinking on 'nac hindo
Out of town I saw Kansas but I reply with "That's M-O"
Who rock it and get the guap in two pockets
In soo offices who thought it was boss to use me to profit
You mocking this, you lost it being narcissistic, who block it
And who not exist
Awesomeness watching 'em drop and chew sausages
More gutter than 5th and [?]
There is no other that's more butter than this and your top
MC list and I empty this put a little bit of twist in the plot
Fixing the chop, no just spitting
With a mission to squash listen, and watch nigga

[Hook: Info Gates]
Coming 'round the corner so fast, tires screeching
Bet you lose attention if you ever try to reach him
Bet you lose your vision if you ever try peeking
We on that good good up in the limousine geekin'
