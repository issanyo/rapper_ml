[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
816 Boyz!
Ain't we sick boy?
Ridin', ridin' through the town, do ya see me?
Baby calm down, you gon' get it, best believe me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it (do it)
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm tryna get tore (so tore)
I don't remember
Same as day and cold (so cold)
Call it December
Wanna get at ya so I'm acting like I'm shy
Then I'll grab her arm when she try to walk by (How you doing?)
Bought a couple of shots of Patr√≥n
Hands all over me, won't leave me alone (Green light!)
Now I think I might take her home
One more shot in the bottle
Gobble it and we gone (Hey! Hey!)
Now we in whip on the way
Told I gotta blindfold her, you can't know where I stay
I was on tilt, she the same way
She said "I'm ready for you to kill it"
I'm like okay! (Okay!)
Got it right there in the car
Club around the corner, we didn't have to go far
Gave it up easy, 'cause she know I'm a star
All gas no brakes, I ain't talking 'bout my car

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it (do it)
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I got her off Caribou Lou
You can guess what's next
If you didn't know that I'm the bunk rock king
Let's bet that homie I'm 'bout to get it, get it
Straight to the mall and hit it, split it
She chose that dough and pull my trunks down and wants to find now
She's wit it, wit it
I was all gas, no brakes
Kutty Cal gave her something
She prolly didn't wanna take
So I told her, mama give it just a second
Then it prolly won't be so
Until I hit her with the flex again
And now she's screamin "MO'!"

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Give it up quick if you're with it and pure wicked
You're gonna get yourself a for sure ticket to screw villain
I be quick to stick it
N9ne has got your bodily, fine is what you gotta be
'Ginas want comradery, 'cause I'm a hot commodity
I am such an animal, I am not a human being
I just want my antidote and ram it in a ho like it's screwed between
I don't give a damn if it is black or European
Pump that gas in her ass and she's for sure to cream

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it (Hey! Hey!)

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Yep baby got a nice face (nice face)
Big booty and a tight waist (tight waist)
And if I tip her she might shake (she might shake)
That booty up in my face

[Verse 5: Makzilla]
Makzilla is a getta, 816-I
10 minute mackas, I'm a one night hitta
And I'mma take her and not you, 'cause she thicker
They both dickie mouth, so I bet I won't kiss her (Kali-)
Kali shut up, I know I'm moving too fast
But I love those thick chicks, wearin' jeans is a task
Your body's so bangin', areolas, big ass
But ooh girl you pooted and I smell it, all gas

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it (do it)
All gas, no brakes
All ass gon' shake
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it (do it)
We gon' do it, do it, do it

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]

If you with me, Kali Baby!
