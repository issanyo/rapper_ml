[Verse 1: Dalima]
A thick ho with indo
Go out ridin and chok
With a young fire ass nigga
Gripping that nina on foe
From the hood with the Bianca
Driving a black Miata
Take me to 55th
I'm a get with my playa partna

[Verse 2: D-Loc]
Fresh off a vega
Smelling like the dough burned(fill in the blank.)
Charly& Erban, over on 55th
Curb Servin
Right next the dirty suburban
The money's worth it tonight
Unfamiliar vehicle busted down
The Miata coming tight
Not knowing that was my nigga Dalima
(Known for banging tracks)
Hanging out the window yelling lets ride black
Introduced me to the  girl
(Baby the was the nigga Loc I was telling you about)
Haya doin  baby girl is pleasure to meet you with no doubt

[Verse 3: Dalima]
We hit the interstate
Smoking vegas, checkin my plate
Checking for the time(8:00)
It ain't to early and it at to late
The drinks in the trunk
The weed here's the blunts
In need of a destination to
Pop the exo and get numb

[Chorus]

Let Get It Started
With Bianca's all around us lets have a ville life party tonight.(Cool I'm wit it)
Intoxicated, puffin delicious Vegas, lets get some real tight ladies tonight.(Cool I'm wit it)

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Hoes, we steady makin em say "Ahhh"
They love me makin em say "Ahhh"
But to you bros, if you hatin us say "Byeee" (what, what)
My milli makin em say "Dieee"
I be that white infidel drinkin, hittin yo bitch in the back of yo lincoln
Never bustin off in that cause im thinkin, this bitch way too old to be stinkin
Little bitch turn me off, now im shrinkin
Now she gotta suck me off cause im blinkin, cause im peekin
2 packs of Condells when im creepin
All hail to the N9ne
Yall hoes knows when its time for the grind
But being around RDVs with STDs is a crime
Doing 86 because
This bitch is scandalous
Gotta get this bitch out
If i hit this im branded wit
7 day itch no doubt
Im with my niggaros
Tryna get it throwed
Hit a grit of hoes
Hella pitiful Jigalos
Get the hookers up out they clothes, gettin pinnacle
With the twin, we begin again with the limb
My nigga D-Loc, where the hoes go
That nigga Tech N9ne gettin dough
Think yo hoes dont know nigga! (What!) Hahahaha
[Chorus]

[Verse 5: ]
Ones for the bargain
Now these hoes seekin out twins
Nigga never panicin
Going off Heineken
Eyes are on my back for niggas that kill
Went to the bathroom to check my skrill
Somewhere picked up a counterfeit bill
Anyhow we backed to clubbing and VIP
But on my way passed the doors
Some bianc grabbed my sleeve
It was very good that I meet her
Back a week ago
Curious on the DL
About what the brings and what it holds
She questioned
Like who you rolling with
And I was like
My nigga Tech N9ne
