[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm this way cause I got up and got it
When I was the oddest to demolish the hottest scholars
With all of this God-ish product
Call it way polished, I jotted
Dotted then they got it bollocks'd
Stayed modest but brought it psychotic
Thought, it's raw and sick
But everybody didn't wanna give a nigga the time of day
How will I ever reach another when I'm in the grave
I gotta be different to get the grip with the pace
Say, say, say what you want about Nina
The one who's wishing he coming up missing
That one is a dreamer
Calling me ugly I laugh
Cause I'm rough as rugby and fast
Industry's chubby and flab
You look sick, pudgy and crass
Now your chick wanna hug me and smash
And look lovely with cash instead of muggy and clash
You act like we was buddies in class
Got my painted face
Ain't it great?
Really illuminated made it with entertainer's space
Better to bring it straight and gain it late than aim at fake
Fame, as for my brain its fate
That I strained in faith
And became the great
Yates!

[Hook: ¡Mayday! & Tech N9ne]
No love or nothin', just blood and sufferin' for the ugly duckling
No love or nothin', just blood and sufferin' for the ugly duckling

Trust me, trust me nothin', trust me, trust me nothin'
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful, but get treated like an ugly duckling
Trust me, trust me nothin', trust me, trust me nothin'
Is worse than knowin' you're beautiful, but get treated like an ugly duckling

[Verse 2: Priceless of Aqualeo]
Ever since I came out the womb and I was birthed to the planet
It's like the Earth couldn't stand it, I was just worthless abandoned
So I write verses in cursive to try and cope with the damage
Citizens gave me, you hoto’s gon' feel my curses in Spanish
Hoppin' in hearses then vanish, though not the first to be banished
Or ostracized cuz I prophecised how the church is scareless
See my words are just managed, perfectly perched on a canvas
Paintin a picture with scriptures, with my fellow dirty from Kansas
So I'mma spit on the wax and flip on a track and spit all my pain
Rather than give me a gat, empty the mac, shatter and split off my brain
People are strange
Hoisters be spendin' a dime on the top tryna get on a chains
I have to devise me a plot to then capitalize on my stock
And then get me some change
See all the hate that they gave me it fuel my passionate speech
Made me react on the track and start whoopin' ass on the beat
So since I'm Rudolph my nose is up like I flew off the grease
Head in the sky, hella fly and high like I blew off the suite

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Acie High of Aqualeo]
It's about god damned time
Go ahead shine the light over here over darkness
What ya thought? We were gonna play dead, roll over and add up losses
Damn fools
No more playin' cool politicking with the rules eat fools in the carcass
Cause we back well season the leave
And don't believe the vegan on sausage
But don't ride dick now, and act like your light bulb's lit now
Keep signin' the killers and fat drug dealers really the big shit now
(Take a big shit now)
I gotta state these niggas be weak runnin' round like they nuts cut loose
Can't even shake a nigga hand gotta dab a nigga up
Fuck around and touch butt fuck juice
Mayday to the pay day to they say we stay don't cut that noose
Yes, off with the heads then it's off to the bed
Gettin' head like duck-duck-goose (Awoo!)
Technicians form a petition to never ever let it up
On a rapper that sucks in this industry fucks
With a bucks that wanna hit and swarm from a duck
Crystal meth, cocaine, e pills
With a little weed fill and a lotta freewill
Add a couple refills to whenever we spill
Won't see thrills like these skills on a steep hill
That's some hott shit, that's hott shit
One more time, don't ride dick
Shit I got us creepin' on your level
Aqualeo now that's speakin' of the devil
