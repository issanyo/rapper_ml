[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Well alright, heh-heh-heh, this one goes out to all my hustlers
Out there in Kansas City, doin' your thang, baby
You already know this nigga, man, he's been run around here for years
Hustler, this is theme music and every can hustler must have some
His family is folks, they call him Scoob, baby, but y'all know him like

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Big Scoob, that my nigga rippin' it up
Put the hood up on my shoulders, man, I'm liftin' it up
Tip in my cup, still a nigga givin' a fuck
You can get touched, pussy nigga spillin' them guts
Man they wanna see the boss don
I be stompin' on the hardest streets they walk on
Old nigga but my knuckle game is still on, it's still strong
You can test it nigga, watch me get my vill on, yeah
I ain't changed nigga, hungry for bread, left me for dead
Duckin' dodgin' shakin' the feds
But they missed nigga, so I'm back searchin' for mine
Fresh off the grind, still gutta sick with these rhymes
Flippin' these lines, you can see the truth in my eyes
Never no lies, leven vill screamin' with pride
'Til the day that they rest me, hog stylin'
Gutta livin' villain that's me
(Tell 'em who you talkin' 'bout)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (4X)
Scoob, Big Scoob, Scoob
Scoob, Scoob, Scoob
(Scooby-Doobie-Doobie-Doo)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
The way I drink heavy when I party and shit
The way I disrespect a bitch and say sorry and shit
The way I make it switch it from red to dookie brown
Spot a curve and dope boss dogg and lay 'em down
On the roads and be no lost cause and wait around
Show them hoes there'll be no toss drawers 'til you pay the hound
The way I refrain from hangin' with simps
And never fuckin' with shrimp that ain't deveined
The way I smash for the cash, the way I mash harder (Flash)
Caught a broadcast on the blast with a last broader
Why I'm half martyr, the reason I take showers
'Cause I don't like sittin' in my ass water
My reason for red chucks and red laces
My reason for fuckin' up and never catchin' fair cases
The way I go so hard on the liquor
Vill livin' is a given and create it because of my nigga

[Hook] (4X)

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Mayne I'm back and I'm hungry
Big homie from the show me niggas know me
Only villain take a yic and then I cloning
Real talk I can give it how you want it
I can put you niggas on that 5-6
Villain niggas movin' the crowd and I'm tryin' to make strange
Put some hog in they style, dogg and I'm wild
Vans left the bark on the ground, stompin' him out
Pussy nigga runnin' his mouth, but for now I'mma changed man
OG so I'm stickin' to the game plan
Takin' papers, makin' moves like a grown man
Vill steppin' in the seven first up for the field plan
And you can get it if you want it with me
Definitely, I can give you more than you need
Gutta livin' and I'm screamin' the V, wherever I be
That's how you niggas know that it's me

[Hook] (4X)

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
This has been brought to you by big old of cup
Of a billion finest Canadian whiskey, take a drink, man
We're the party and kickin' it, baby
On this album, you know, ain't nobody gave me a dollar, a nothin'
And I'm comin' up to Big Scoob
You know I did hustled, man, I need some money, man
