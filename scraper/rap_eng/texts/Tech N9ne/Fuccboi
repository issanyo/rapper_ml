[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
You don't got G's, you don't got keys
Nigga you never knew the meaning of real cheese
But you get the fakin' the funk and I'm 'bout to waken a punk cause I hate when a chump whoof in his own beats
Takin' 'bout you got the plug
Never been a dealer ya fibbin' it make you wanna take a whoo-wop ta blood
Who shot ya mug?
I don't mean it too hot to hug
Who got ya love?
Mothafucka you not a thug
You say that you 'bout it 'bout it
Got so many women in and out I doubt it
But you sleepin' on the floor without a pallet
And I'm callin' you out nigga, loud I shout it, you a bitch!
Specimen without a dick
Transformed into a chick
Man born with a clit the way you sit
But you front like you like to beef a lot
Square like a pizza box
Supposed to be a "C" for cock
Instead you're gonna get a "T" for twat
Me and you is night and day like a muthafuckin' equinox
I was just waitin' for the beat to drop
To tell you fakin' leads to shock
What you get when you off in a fuccboi situation
Lookin' at me like I speak Chinese you ain't makin' no bokchoy nigga fakin'
But us boys are the nation that'll never trust boys on occasion
When they be lyin' I know if you live or dyin' is a tough choice but we waitin', nigga
