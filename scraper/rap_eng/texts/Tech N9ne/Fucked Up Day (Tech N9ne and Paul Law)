[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Ya
We at the end of this shit
Finally at the end of this shit
My nigga Paul Law on vocals
Midwest side
Bout to drop a couple light weight verses
Check it out

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Be warned
So many motherfuckers in the inner city got me torn
Many niggas have sworn
But don't even understand the storm
So we gotta move the, hold the press
Never can slow the best
But I'm having a fucked up day so I just progress
When smoking on them green clovers (Yes)
Thinkin' about killin' a bitch if a bitch insist
On usin' the bottleneck sources
I give her what I mean by death from anghellic forces
Of course It's the fist of fury
Mr. T.I.B.D. and several twister
Uplift a high plane drifter and differ
Mitch bade (Nigga)
Display (Bigga')
Next he'll find himself in the middle of a ditch lay (With her)
Big parade of them slithery things I mean stuffed in grey (Litter)
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this be borin' low
So reach go on and be alarmed and best be warned, be warned

[Hook: Paul Law]
Let me
Warn you
I'm having a fucked up day today
And I just dont got no time to play
Let me
Warn you
This shits getting worse for me to day, to day, to day

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I drench to get drunk
I thinks to get funk
My inks a bit bunk
So I switch my pen and then begin my friend I blinks cause it bumps
RD's give a nigga [?] we say walla milli dollar, then break a lot a jaw
