[Verse 1: Murs]
Oh my God!
Is that, is that Murs?
Well, well I don't see Tech so you think we can talk to him?
I just wanna ask him a few questions
What is the exact date that you received your Strange necklace?
And what exactly is it that Tech N9ne eats for his breakfast?
And how does he crease his pants?
How does he make the people dance?
And what is that sign he throws up every time he sees his fans?
And who's that guy in the van? Alien on the drums?
Is he an illegal immigrant? Where the heck is he from?
And who's that white guy that's so nasty on the bass?
And what exactly is wrong with Krizz Kaliko's face?
Fuck that
How does my dick taste?
Why is you tryna dictate?
Why is you asking all these questions?
Can't you see that I'm shit faced?
I'm off that Caribou Lou
I ain't tryna do an interview with you
I done had like one, two, four, or five, a few too many
But if any of you bitches wanna talk about fuckin' or suckin'
Or practicing the erotic art of human reproduction
Then we got something to discuss
If not get the fuck up off the bus
Why is you tryna bust my balls when I'm just tryna bust a nut
Fuck

[Hook: JL]
What's the situation?
Why you want that information?
Is this an interrogation?
What is you the police?
What you tryna do?
Feel like it's an interview
Who are you reporting to?
What is you the police?
Acting like you pacing
What charges am I facing?
Am I under investigation?
What is you the police?
Why you wanna know?
What you questioning me for?
Oh you must be on patrol
What is you the police?
What is you the police?
What is you the police?
What is you the police?
What is you the police?
Why you wanna know?
What you questioning me for?
Oh you must be on patrol
What is you the police?

[Verse 2: Tech n9ne]
I ain't got no time for you to be questioning me, messing with me
Wondering if broads steady effing with me, definitely
I am high profile like Griselda's dope file
Why you think I'm aggy when you spoke trial
I'm ghost now
I was never fond of no handcuffs
Ain't no relationship good when they havin' you jammed up
Insecurities, her and her crew were accusers
Makin' life hella blue like a Hoover
Having a perfect partner is the way of the future
The way of the future
The way of the future
The way of the future
Run away from one, go down to the bar and come back with a two-fer
Taking 'em up to the room and engage in a three, put 'em both in an Uber
Sherlock Holmes, no longer punching her twat no
She's a for sure cop like in that Roger Murtaugh show
Like having hella coppers deployed to bring me more heat
Now I question you like a D-Boy
Is you the Police?

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
What goes around, it comes around
The truth is always told and found
It's going down
Upped my buzz so now they wanna know about
What I did, where I think I'm going, who I know around the way
But a motor mouth composure, what I won't allow
Cause what I do and what I say is my prerogative
Major pain, when every phrase you face is interrogative
Many bear witness, many names remain anonymous
A lot of times, the truth and lies all sound the same like homonyms
Polly want a cracker, now I'm talking on that polygraph
Actin' like I'm movin' weight, dropped a couple bodybags
Analyzin' body language, read him no Miranda Rights
With no attorney present, or evidence, so they can't indict
Lip is tight, unless you hit the superman with kryptonite
Soon as homie ousted, all he want to do is get inside
Which is why, keep your circle tight, bitches switchin' sides
Long as we got trust within us, there is never shit to hide
