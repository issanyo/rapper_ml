[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Oooh
Yeaaah
Mama told me I was her angel sent down from heaven
When I was a little one enthusiasm caught my dome and lessons
Teachin' me 'bout the Seven and how I should be a reverend
She really gave me a "this world is not my home" impression
Sent down to help lost souls and fight their foes
Angels chose to toss woes when the night air's cold
But it got to me when she looked up and said (I'll soon be gone)
Then I was right there, froze, cause that meant, I'd be alone
The second, that she was gone, I was beckoned by my brethren
Then my head spinned like (buzz), Tech went to be a grown
A complex gent, that freed the wrong
And blessed it with the best scripts
I invested my whole life, chose light
But the people down here, don't know what to do with it
When I fly away, cause I really don't know
Too many that's true with it, ya know?

[Bridge]
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man...

[Hook]
This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
They don't understand me, when I say everybody's family
With the evil deeds they proved me wrong, I failed
To the heavens you can hand me
Cause my god will never just land me
Down deep with Satan, that is not my home in hell
But where I'm living now, people are living foul
They keep they heaters on the key to stone
I'm mentally stiffened, wow
A lot of love is missing now, so (I'll soon be gone)
Cause they don't wanna listen to what I'm giving thou
Love, but who gets it usually disperse
B-b-but wait, it gets worse, I found out that it never helped it hurts
I thought my job was to give it all the works
To many it's worldly, when you can't control your thirst
So if I can't bring happy, I'll go
Flings that this queen catch me really seems tacky, ya know?

[Bridge]
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Ya know?
(I know)
Man...

[Hook]
This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Fear not, cause this ain't the point when you hear shots
Me, and my peers got, by God's will dropped in the weird pot
I wanna ascend cause I'm feelin' like I'm near shock
Mama gone I'm feelin' like I want the rest of my years blocked
You got your ears locked?
I wanna fly away cause inside I have eternal tear drops

[Hook]
This world is not my home
This life will soon be gone
And one day, I'll spread my wings
Gonna fly away, I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly away
I'm gonna fly
