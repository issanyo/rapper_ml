[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Some call it money, some call it mail
Some call it skrill, we call it relish!
Gotta make that cream, that green
Ain't got time for all that other bullshit
You know, gotta let that shit work
Know what I'm sayin', cop that Amerikilla CD
Yes, and do it like this

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You call it money, we call it relish cause the group is attractive
Quality keep calling me and plus it keep the biancas hyperactive
Superstar in your city pluggin' ze diddies
Even [?] on top of that you writin' Lexus music
We hit Paseo but ay no we don't fuck with yayo
And they know the brutality will turn they shirt the color of Prego
You can be mo', if you got a big [?] green-o
Make some relish at the flamingo casino
Follow me no
My chips is steady stackin' got the pimp all sweat and
Iâ€™m turning flips like I was Mary Lou Retton. Rollin' sevens
Biancas love it when you winnin' break up and little relish
To get the telly so y'all can get to sinnin'
I know you seen 'em come, seen 'em go
But you never ever seen a brotha like Nina get the dough
All delicious they see my pocket is vicious
The relish be grantin' they wishes whether nice or malicious
I'mma kick it, get that green flavor at her, get fatter
Abracadabra, make it happen to yourself cause it matters
Don't let nobody tell it, get ya product then you sell it
Whatever you got to do just keep your mind on your relish, nigga

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(Let me tell another story)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(While everybody else is smokin' the spliff)
So don't be jealous cause we mellish and yo pocket is low
Me and my fellas rakin' hell and now the people will know
We makin' relish get that relish call that relish your dough
Which ever way you want ? ? now be gettin' some mo'

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
(Went to the park with major loot) What's that?
(Went to the park with major loot) Yeah
(Went to the park with major loot) That's right
(Hittin' up on bitches but the jealous Mitch is ready to shoot)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I gotta be on my tips when I got them relish lips
I got your [?] now I'm dancin' all up in ya pussy lips, don't even trip
Get my rel' from my record sales that's why the be so compelled
To come around, so they can see some playas put it down
Me and my partners had a good 'ol time
[?] coast [?] gold mine
They know we got relish [?] with the enchanced trunk
Ey, yo, come here and let me take you for yo' dance, bianc
We even took a gang of relish down the street to Bazookas
But the thang with Bazookas they filled with whitey galoopas
Ain't got no problem with that, but I prefer my asses fat
If I can't have that, I rather watch my cash stack
You said that bitch has been jeffin' with who? (That owl, nigga)
I bet my bitch won't even come with you (Bladaow, nigga)
You don't understand I'm a relish man
I got your woman hooked and now she's eatin' out the palm of my hand
So what are you sayin'? That money gets it all for ya
Can purchase sticky-sticky, make a nigga fall, doja
So bring your broads over, we can play: double, triple dare with questions
Or we can freak in my recording session

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(Let me tell another story)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(While everybody else is smokin' the spliff)
So don't be jealous cause we mellish and yo pocket is low
Me and my fellas rakin' hell and now the people will know
We makin' relish get that relish call that relish your dough
Which ever way you want ? ? now be gettin' some mo'

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
So get that relish you gotta be [?] and [?]
You better be about  your green
Money is a must [?] bust, transfer to the [?]
Do what you do to get what you gotta get, one [?]
Gotta make that relish RISE, Kimbo SLICE, even on D-Day
To make that rel-ish, we have to sell-this
Gotta make that green so when [?] I gotta swell this
So have some money in your pocket if you're hustlin' [?]
Motherfucker it's too late to pay attention because it's over and shit

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(Let me tell another story)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(While everybody else is smokin' the spliff)
So don't be jealous cause we mellish and yo pocket is low
Me and my fellas rakin' hell and now the people will know
We makin' relish get that relish call that relish your dough
Which ever way you want ? ? now be gettin' some mo'

[Outro]
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(Let me tell another story)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(While everybody else is smokin' the spliff)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
(? ? ? ? supposed to be)
(Money up to here but unemployed)
