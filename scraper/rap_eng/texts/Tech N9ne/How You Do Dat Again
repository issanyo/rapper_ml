[Young Bleed]
This is Strange Music
That's whats up
Yeah
(How you do dat there x5)
Trap Door Entertainment man and we don't care

[Verse 1: Young Bleed]
Like pimp the kin
Pimp to the bone
We got money over here
And I'mma get me some
Like D and J and Rev Run
They still killing in this rap game
I got my gun
Tech N9ne and Bleed
Or my Brotha Lynch Hung
This is all I need to proceed
And get dumb
Because wait a minute mother fucker
How you do that son?
Get money over seas
Blowing trees til dumb
Hollering who that?
Said that they want it for the Saints
Knowing that Vince Lombardi
Bacardi to rum
No prints
No car keys
I'm under the sun
But prince
Like Nelson Riders
Get me over the drum
Convinced without the car keys
I came from the sun
And went from BRPs
To smoking a lot
Louisiana off the handle
Like a favorite son
You know me I do it big
Rest in peace to Big Pun
For real

[Hook: Young Bleed]
See them hollering how you do dat there
From the South to the North
Homie we don't care
Keep them yelling how you do dat there
From the West to the East Coast we don't care
That's whats up

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Mr. Kansas City with the Bleed
We kixin' it harder
We drinking Kansas City Tea
My every mission is to 'round them pretty b's
You already known that it's insanity with thee
I make 'em holla how you do dat there
She say she loving whatever
I'm doing to that tail
She knew that's rare
I'm getting down through that there
Right after I send to chew her other boo that's fair
I know everybody knowing
Big Tech's ripping it
Always money blowing
His check's infinite
If any bitches whoring you can
Get Tech pimping it
And I'm a keep it going in the
Midwest kixing it
Rump on my lap at all times
Valuptious strippers they want to be with Tech N9ne
Niggas be like:
Huh?
Nigga what?
I'm saying huh?
You's a fuck nigga what?
Throwing them B's

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Dirty nails, spitting them dirty tales
Getting them dirty deals, tipping them dirty scales
Hitting and gripping
Slipping it in the pretty girls
Getting that infinite crip
Has been giving it to me well
Strange
I'm locc to da brain
Insane
And always in the fast lane
Kobe with the ball
And you ain't even getting past man
Ew we coming raw with it
Doing it like all did it
Twisted two middle fingers west coast
We all did it
Don't matter the color
We threw it up
We all lived it
Trying to get that money like a tall midget
All tickets
Young Bleed, Tech N9ne this is all 6's
All 7
Call Kevin then we all click click
Best believe I get that vest
Destiny's sickest
Rest to these switches bet your chest
To be quickest
Huh?
Nigga what?
Nigga huh?
Nigga huh?
Nigga what?
Throwing them G's

[Hook]
