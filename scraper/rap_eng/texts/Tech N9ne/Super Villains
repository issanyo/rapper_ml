[Intro]
Straight off the streets of KC
Dedicated, and by most suckers hated
Super Vill, on a mission for a mill
Niggas who recognize and specialize in real
And we will strike down great vengeance and furious anger
To those who attempt to poison and destroy my villains
And you will know our name is the dogs
When we lay our vengeance upon thee

[Hook]
I went from streets to rap
From dimes and sacks to rhymes and wacks
(And it ain’t no stoppin' my cash cause I’m a Super Villain)
Nigga I bleed mac and feed the pack yo dogs is back
(And it ain’t no stoppin' my mass ‘cause I’m a Super Villain)
I went from streets to rap
From dimes and sacks to rhymes and wacks
(And it ain’t no stoppin' my cash cause I’m a Super Villain)
Nigga I bleed mac and feed the pack yo dogs is back
(And it ain’t no stoppin' my mass ‘cause I’m a Super Villain)

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I started small time, dope gang, cocaine
Pushin rocks on the block, I’m never broke mane
Sportin’ and jury and the shit that came with rollin’ hard
You try and test me, you’ll get served with no regard
Shit was hard but I made it through the struggle though
Boss hog, savage villain with the cheddar roll
You niggas know me, fuck some rappin’, Imma factor man
'Cause if it’s crackin’, get it cracklin’, I’m what’s happen man
I’m like a villain from a scene from a gangster movie
Gutter livin’ on your scene and the star is Scooby
You wanna do me ‘cause you hate me and you want my bread
Well bring it to me, when you face me Imma split your head
A super villain with powers, I thought I told you niggas
Sick of dealin’ with cowards and all you phony niggas
I’m the man of the hour and I’m a hungry nigga
I’m indestructible and way too unfuckable

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Player hatred I’m faced with how can this be
When someone inserted these fine women in the matrix
Mix [?] with basic X and lase it with sex
Based in neck, something I can blaze with
We get the pesos (only when I say so)
And we replace hoes (only when I say so)
Makin’ the place low, [?]
Only when I say so (only when I say so)
Bitch (bitch) You went from party [?]
Six plus six with villlions and misfits (nope)
Up on 5-6 with danger could hit quick (yup)
In the midst of couchie bangers and big dicks (yup)
Showin’ no love for the pain (cheah)
Better make way for the pain (cheah)
When the rap show really came (cheah)
Only Tech’s legacy remain (cheah)
Gimme that camera, gimme that relish
Gimme money just to keep fame (cheah)
Get ready for the blood, ready for the mud
Everybody better get ready for the pain

[Hook]
I went from streets to rap
From dimes and sacks to rhymes and wacks
(And it ain't no stoppin my cash cause I’m a Super Villain)
Nigga I bleed mac and feed the pack yo dogs is back
(And it ain't no stoppin' my mass cause I'm a Super Villain)
(Super savage, get my cabbage like it’s mandatory)
I went from streets to rap
From dimes and sacks to rhymes and wacks
(Super savage, get my cabbage like it’s mandatory)
Nigga I bleed mac and feed the pack yo dogs is back

[Verse 3: Bakarii]
I heard a hater motherfucker say:
“Them villains just be rappin they ain't ever did no dirty”
Got me twisted like elastic
Nigga fuck you, Imma keep actin’ funny
Niggas jealous like a bitch when they seen us getin’ money
Imma grown ass man, with nothin’ to prove
I just spit raps, with my villains make moves
Imma true motherfucker, never been past the county
Made the right decisions so them haters never found me
First album independent, nigga five thousand strong
Second album forty thousand screamin: “Rogue Dog”
Now by my third it’s absurd how we get ‘em sold
These roguish ways gotta nigga screamin: “Kutter go”
It’s real shit, get money and bubble
For my dead homies that I lost to the struggle
Know I could be the next ‘til I dance with trouble
Oh I when I advance and enhance my touble nigga

[Verse 4: Txx Will]
We got ‘em scared to glance at these niggas takin’ chances
I’m too far advanced in this scamless dacin’
Normally get ‘em sparked doin’ dirt in the dark
Receivin’ love from the real, only hated by Mark
A hundred percent, villain nigga, as real as it gets
Can make my moves on the streets and still stay in the mix
Plus I don’t give a fuck if them bustas like us
I might start a fight up and fuck the whole night up
And you should see they faces when they heard I was comin’
It’s like they know that Imma soldier, never nervous or runnin’
I’m comin’, for the money and you know that’s a must G
Then frown up my face and dare a nigga to touch me
The first nigga to trip’ll get his motherfuckin’ wig split
It’s real like that, don’t get this rap shit twisted
We can’t be touched, that’s what the whole fuckin’ point is
Super villain: can’t beat us, can’t join us
