[Chorus: Kottonmouth Kings]
They let us in, now they want us out
That's cause we're different, they can't figure us out
They don't know what we all about
So we're gonna shout
Fuck the industry, fuck the industry
Fuck m high, fuck m low, let m know, show to show

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You know what it is, punk
Time to get it pumpin, and get this bitch crunk
Industry kings, but we caused calateral dammage
We bring heat, and just the right food
Meet my crew, on some FBI 2
Nigga, we underdogin, But that don't mean we under y'all, and
We get that cash and go ballen
But this industry's lame, scared of these colors, scared of these brains
This fucking industry's scared of me, man
Been in this rap game, for 19 years
In 19 years, it's been a minute since I seen tears
These lightning fears, done made me strong as hell
Now I'm growing, brought my partners along as well
Told y'all, we road hogs, fuck this industry, I fold y'all
Roll call, Johnny, Krizz, X and Vack
Tech, independent niggas, we back

[Chorus: Kottonmouth Kings]
They let us in, now they want us out
That's cause we're different, they can't figure us out
They don't know what we all about
So we're gonna shout
Fuck the industry, fuck the industry
Fuck m high, fuck m low, let m know, show to show

[Verse 2: Kottonmouth Kings]
The industry, they a bunch of punks
We eat m up, spit m out
We on the floor, let m know, we on the floor
Hit m high, hit m low, hit m good, here we go
Hit his chin, split his lip
Whip that shit up, then go back to my clique
Bitch, and we don't give a fuc
You want this shit boosted, but you playing with a dog if you do this
So sit back, relax, shut the fuck up
We got Calhoun, you understand where the fuck we coming from
It's johnny Rickter, yeah, I'm the chosen one
Turned into a trick, now I'm fuckin them bitches and shit
We still here, no I'm not going nowhere, let's keep that clear

[Chorus: Kottonmouth Kings]
They let us in, now they want us out
That's cause we're different, they can't figure us out
They don't know what we all about
So we're gonna shout
Fuck the industry, fuck the industry
Fuck m high, fuck m low, let m know, show to show
