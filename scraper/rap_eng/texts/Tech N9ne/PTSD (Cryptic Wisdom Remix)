I remember when I was on the road and I was spending every cent I made to keep from going overboard
Pretending I was OK, alright, Oh and did I mention that I blew my  engine over for embroiders with a blessing
What a shame, everyday, nothing would ever really be the same
It was like one after the other can a brother do whatever just to get a break
I bought a vehicle off of the side of the road just to make it to the stage
10 hours away and they had no idea what I had been going through, what I would pray
How do I say to my crew that I'm not even paying we're staying in gritty hotels?
You deserve better than that and I wanted to give it to you but instead it was hell
Loathing myself, don't wanna fail but losing my class doesn't ring a bell
I needed more credit my debit was headed for deficit, fed up but you couldn't tell
I wasn't prepared for what this had done to me
Was getting me gassed up, my faith it was on empty
Went to the dark side, forgive me for my anger
Sorry to leave you hanging but I don't wanna talk about it anymore
