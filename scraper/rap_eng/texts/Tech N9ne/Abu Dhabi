[Intro]
816 Boyz (okey)
Ain't we sick, boy? (okey)
Are you really going to say that, buddy?

We gettin' money over here
Gettin' money over there
Gettin' money over here
Gettin' money over there
All night and all day

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Pull up in a '96 whoop de whammy
816 Boyz got that grammy
My baby momma's momma told me she can't stand me
Rollin' up and hella boom, screamin' like a banshee
Get the arab money, that Abu Dhabi
Keep a hand on in case they try to rob me
Tryin' to get the paper, tryin' to count that money
Drivin' my scraper around like a Bugatti
Abu Dhabi is good but too much
We keepin' everything hood that we touch
I like it, I love it, I want some more of it, I say
Don't know Abu Dhabi? You gon' learn today

[Hook]
Look at me, I'm on my Abu Dhabi
I'm like "oooh", that's Abu Dhabi
All night and all day
It's all good, it's all Abu Dhabi

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
My life is all Abu Dhabi, O.B.K.B. baby
They been hatin' lately, maybe 'cause I made a crazy statement
When I bought the 'lac gold back and the range I be rollin'
New crocodile skin things on my soles when
I'll be slidin' through the function like a Spike Lee movie
On my Kansas City ice tea
Moving like excuse me, you must be from Ireland
'Cause every time I see you my penis is Dublin
(MVP?) Check, nigga
(2 years in a row?) Check, nigga
(A Wayne verse?) Check, well?
(Yeah, Tech got it) My nigga
Abu Dhabi I'm good, all I need is a check, nigga
Money, family, royalty, most of all is respect, nigga

[Hook]
Look at me, I'm on my Abu Dhabi
I'm like "oooh", that's Abu Dhabi
All night and all day
It's all good, it's all Abu Dhabi

[Verse 3: Makzilla]
Pause. Check Twitter, it's trendin'
Real DJs go ahead and start spinnin'
I know it's the fifth time everyone has requested
But don't be a bitch like the Grinch who stole Christmas
Abu Dhabi, it means it's all good
Wishin' they Abu Dhabi is like wishin' a nigga would
"I can't be Abu Dhabi" means I can't be touched
If you got me Abu Dhabi'd, you got me fucked up
Woo woo, woo woo, woo! For the family!
Sha-shake, sha-shake shake ya ass hottie!
Wanna see ya hands up in the party!
Now that's- now that's Abu Dhabi

[Hook]
Look at me, I'm on my Abu Dhabi
I'm like "oooh", that's Abu Dhabi
All night and all day
It's all good, it's all Abu Dhabi

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
(A!) B-U D-H-A-B-I
(Pay!) The crew, he pay nay, he die
(Play!) Me through, DJ make me fly
(Away!) Yeehoo, 'cause we H-A-P-P-Y!
Humm du la lah, love my skrill la la la
Well, some milla, ya, yes I feel ya mama
Sum after sum, everyone wants to color ya
For ya dolla-la-la
Yes! Whole lotta money intrigue ya
I go money crazy, psycho like Libra
Dough in my jeans make me lean like Pisa
So when you see me say "Abu Dhabi, my nigga!"

[Hook]
Look at me, I'm on my Abu Dhabi
I'm like "oooh", that's Abu Dhabi
All night and all day
It's all good, it's all Abu Dhabi
Look at me, I'm on my Abu Dhabi
I'm like "oooh", that's Abu Dhabi
All night and all day
It's all good, it's all Abu Dhabi

[Outro]
Now who wants a cookie?
