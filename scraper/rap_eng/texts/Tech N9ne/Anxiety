[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Who you really think is
Watchin' while you sleepin'?
Why won't you believe in me? Me
What you think is makin' me anxious? Ain't just satan
We all should pray to God and be free
Free..

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)
Anxiety! It freaks me out
It's drivin' me! It creeps me out
Inside of me! Can you peep me out?
I'm going, going! Gone, gone!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
In the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Tellin' me I'll need a gun just in case of a brawl
I can block 'em, block 'em all, shoot 'em up 'till them fall
It's something really fucked up going on inside of me
Can't believe the hold he got on me, it gotta be
Temporary, cause the shit I feel is very scary
I think little pills is necessary
Cause I can't tell what I am anymore, an animal
An Amityville, be a man and take a stand and he will
(Do somethin' 'bout it!) Cause often I'm thinkin' bout offin' me
Yellin' to the coffin, but hell is gonna be costin' me
Cause of the crazy, crazy world, and this crazy girl
That I'm made this way, this way I'm gon' stay
In limbo, limbo now, how low can you go?
Paranoid, sleepin' with my gun, now I think you know it's

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)
Anxiety! It freaks me out
It's drivin' me! It creeps me out
Inside of me! Can you peep me out?
I'm going, going! Gone, gone!

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
If you creep up in Krizz' house yo ass ain't gon' be walkin' out

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Who you really think is
Watchin' while you sleepin'?
Why won't you believe in me? Me
What you think is makin' me anxious? Ain't just satan
We all should pray to God and be free
Free..

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Psycho, Michael
Schitzo, get yo fix
Too many hits'll make you slit your wrists
Chemically imbalanced, mentally challenged, it's sort of iffy
Something's really wrong with the son of your uncle Ippy
So who did this to me? If you got mo' to give then give it to me
This blue balloon is like a prison to me
Cause I can't sit with my back to the do' no mo'
Even in a minute in they place
But I'm packin' the five after the fo'
Feel I gotta lock a demon in his space
You can't wake me up without waking me up swinging, swinging
I'm livin' livid, my dreams are so vivid, what's the meaning?
This world ain't safe for my seed, ain't a place for my species
The heebies, the jeebies, is giving me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)
Anxiety! It freaks me out
It's drivin' me! It creeps me out
Inside of me! Can you peep me out?
I'm going, going! Gone, gone!

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
I feel like a fucking maniac in public
If you creep up in Krizz' house yo ass ain't gon' be walkin' out
