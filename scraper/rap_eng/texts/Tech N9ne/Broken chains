[Intro: Tech N9ne (i'm not putting the whole thing cause its really long)]
Here in the streets baby, crazy!
Tech N9ne!
(laughing)
Strange music represent baby
Tech N9ne and Lyrycyst. (Huh)
Like this! (cha)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Everybody wanna' get in the middle of my life
Wanna' know about the Nina, the women and my wife
Hella' rumors i get enough off the haters, you can bet they gonna' do it till i die
What i do up in the crilla for rilla is my right, get the women up and flip it then stick it, it's my night, everybody looking at me like i'm a killer, but never looking tech up in the eye
Zing, zing, zing and a one, two, three
Why the negative energy gotta' come through me (me, me)
Teccanina doing this, he doing that, stinging the women like a bumble bee (bee, bee)
Don't believe, everything you hearing up in the streets, capiche?
Don't ever rack your brain (brain, brain)
Tech N9ne, Lyrycyst well if the gift lifts to this, we're gonna break them chains

[Verse 2: Lyrycyst]
What you talkin' about this gossip, drop it
Cause we'll prosper, profit, mark us, but you cannot stop us or lock us in shackles or lockets
We are no novice, can't contain us
We will rock this cause we rap so futuristic like we were taught by spacely sprockets, you got it?
Anybody wanna test this, i'm restless i'll eat ya'll for breakfast
No weapons, just music in my presence
No peasants, you rappers can't touch this, i'm badder and i'm telling all your chadders, i'm not your average cracker
Your lack of innovation makes your music a displacement to the way rappers intended so how can you talk offensive
Your a product for the jingles, you're a hot wheel i'm a diesel
Get some musical talent before you speak of my people

[Hook: lyrycyst and Tech N9ne]
Cause lyrycyst has broke the chains, i'm out i broke the chains
Teccanina's broke the chains, i'm out i broke the chains (x2)

[verse 3: lyrycyst]
Keep on living i don't need no more opinions, this is my time i was given, I wish people would just listen
Cause I feel like Micheal Jackson and just wanna be left alone, cause your standing on my garden, just step back and left it grow
Lyrycyst will never be tamed, gotta' maintain and bring my reign so no matter what they say I'll entertain until i drain and this name is a gift, i was raised with the tip
Don't refrain and don't drift, they will praise lyrycyst
When I come, stepping to the pace of my drums, deep down there's a sound, it's growing rapidly and ready to come out
Bow down, to a righteous being molded from the hands of god, me and Tech(Tech echoed x2) N9ne (N9ne echoed x2), will make this planet rock! Common!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Hey everybody, hey everybody, why i gotta lay everybody, spray everybody with a A.K to the body, may everybody
I don't get away with it buddy, say don't they know i'm way naughty
Shake the lane and break the chains
Don't hate the player, but hate the game, i'mma quake the frame and I will never ever take the shame, everybody wanna create the pain
Tech N9ne, Lyrycyst, how could rhyme give us this
He say, she say, we say he gay, but they dying to hear us spit
Everywhere I go, everywhere i flow, it seems to be rumors all around me, everywhere i show, people in my bia, but see i disregard demons who down me, broke!
