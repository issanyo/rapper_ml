[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Oheya
Oheya
Ey
Ey
I'm barely
Human

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Just stroke my ego
Call me your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Cold heart
Sinister sicking ya so-so art
If ya seeking a beating, I can treat and give heapins
Make your 'fro blow 'part before yo' flow starts
Wanna be chopping 'em, knocking 'em all in coffins
And I'm stopping ya slow go kart when I go Mozart
Intricate, never vintage in my sentences
I'm gonna make a bro go shart
Look at me, I'm gonna favor the Yeti but with a machete
You better be ready, you in the medi of a killing
I'm deadly when I shred these
Somebody check my head please, I'm edgy
And I'm steady giving hella loving
And I thank you to my niggas who led me to the red B
Barely human, rarely you in the midst of some scary ruins
Until ya try to swipe my independence, Harry Truman
The Nina, the Nickel, we coming very soon and
Building the wack rapper cemetery to bury you in

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Just stroke my ego
Call me your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human
You stroked my ego
Now I'm your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human

[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
King Nickel, Lee Majors
Spending old money, the cake's stale
I beam triple like three lasers on three pistols on a weight scale
It seem simple, I'm pro-meth, I'm pro-magazine
This literature unfold half
Your team lean with you and I'm a nomad
Roaming out in the street killing MC's pencils, making 'em rethink
What they write and might end up in yo' pad
I'm getting dome in my kingdom where
I promise it'll be no crowning (I promise)
The flow harder than Medusa postpartum
The father of the child's coast guarding post-crowning
I'm getting money my nigga, it's funny that nobody thought of you
And if it truly is true to music and induce it to life then my future
Will sound like autotune
Bad grammar and y'all be fucking up no commas
For you to compare me to 'em
He would have to be out of his mind if he barely human

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
Just stroke my ego
Call me your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human
You stroked my ego
Now I'm your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human
