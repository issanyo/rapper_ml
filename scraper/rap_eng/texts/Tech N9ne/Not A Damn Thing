[Chorus]
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play
Plus I pulled away a fat stack anyway
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
They wanna know what I'ma do today
Not a damn thing, fuck what anybody say

[Bridge]
What? Where they do that?
Why they do that? (what?)
Why they do that?
Why they do that?

[Verse 1]
Right here right now
I really wanna know where the smoke and booze at
I'm taking a off day, yup and I ain't 'bout to lose that
I'm finna be absent like Bueller (Bueller)
Now's the time, the time is happening like Mueller (Mueller)
Not a hair has been seen, it's not an embarrassin' thing
Callin' in, lyin' to kick, it's the American dream like
I'm gonna blow a cone by the pool
Smoke up to many songs, I can choose
Then right to my phone, call my crew
Hit up Stevie Stone, Frizz, JL, and Joey Cool
That's diggable, now my homies is with me
That'll tell my chick, hit some hippie
Make thickies, that's less miserable
In Tech's crib you know, everybody gonna get physical
Eat some food then turn on the tube for Netflickables

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play
Plus I pulled away a fat stack anyway
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
They wanna know what I'ma do today
Not a damn thing, fuck what anybody say

[Bridge]
What? Where they do that?
Where they do that? (what?)
Where they do that?
Where they do that?

[Verse 2]
Right here in America, we work until our hands are blue-black
So we cherish a day to ditch, I thought you knew that
Uh, I'm tryna party at home baby, I'm tryna, uh, fuck off!
I'ma be stuck in a zone baby
With a prime cut Don's finest wine to help me buss off!
Yeah, hit the liq', hit the bong
If the missus is trippin, you tell the missus you grown
If it quick as the bitchin', run to the strippers with thongs
Working the daytime shift and ya'll get to sip and it's on
T'was a hell of a ditchin' day, a lie in a biggun way
But the grown up responsibilities, you gotta be the kid and play
I deserve to be ghost to you, 'cause I am King
So today I just chose to do not a damn thing

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
Instead of work, I just wanna play
Plus I pulled away a fat stack anyway
I don't wanna do a damn thing today
Don't wanna go, I'm just gonna stay
They wanna know what I'ma do today
Not a damn thing, fuck what anybody say
