[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, heh..
I'm just gon' tell a couple stories real quick
Shit that I think is pretty awkward, you know what I'm sayin'?
Check it out

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Kickin' it up in Salt Lake City
'Bout to be doin' a show and the boss stay really
Lovin' a nigga, I think it's because I'm becoming a killer forever
The piece of my thoughts weigh gritty
But one day someone say: "Why does he gotta be closin'?"
I am the one with the frozen flow and pockets bulgin'
Fair ground it was a explosion
I told the promoter to hold up and I told him I came to rock
Give the famous spot to the man that claim he hot
Twenty-two thousand people saw me make the planet rock
But when I was done, nigga, the show was done
Right when he took the stage everybody runs
And the outcome was three hundred folks set a show
So I'm at the shilo and it was

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Awkward, situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard
In my circle when it's awkward
Situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard, awkward

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Great sex, thanks, Tech
That's what she say, I grab the latex
Off of me, and throw it away to be safe
And I give her the getaway-look and I say softly:
"We gotta move, my bus is leavin'"
I guess that wasn't a good enough reason
To have to go, I gave her a shirt
Not my jersey, I know it hurts
And then I heard call somebody saying come and get me
Grab the gun that's with me that's a no-no
You came and you leaving solo, keep it dolo
Making the walk of shame then I let her out the front
I was in the crunch when the person standin' at the door
Said: "I'm her husband, man, we love you
And this is what she really wants"

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Awkward, situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard
In my circle when it's awkward
Situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard, awkward

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
I ain't even gonna rap this verse, I'm just gonna tell you the story
Cause it's funny as hell to me, you know what I'm sayin'?
We shootin' "Am I A Psycho?" video down in Atlanta
Somewhere outside of Atlanta, it was cold as hell, it was dark
You know what I'm sizzlin', we only had like one trailer for everybody
It was just me, B.o.B and his people, my people
You know what I'm sizzlin'? Aqualeo, satin star, their people, you know what I'm sizzlin'?
Hopsin's people, uh, uh, the make up ladies, people that are in the video
You know I'm sizzlin'? We all in there drinkin' you know what I'm sizzlin'?
I'm in the back all the time, I'm reclusive kinda you know what I'm sayin'
So B.o.B came in the back and he said to me:
"Hey, man, you fuck with them tools?"
I said: "Tools?" He say: "Yeah, man, you fuck with them tools?"
And he pointed his hand like like a gun
And I said: "I ain't got no tools here if that's what you askin'"
And he said: "No, I thought I saw some tools back here"
I said: "Hell nah, nigga, I ain't got no tools back here, man"
"Nigga, I got God with me, nigga, and angels around me,"
And we start laughing, and he's like: "Nah, nah, cause I go to the gun range"
And I'm like: "Oh, that's cool, but we good right here, man
We ain't got no guns down here" and we was laughing
And when he was leaving out I said: "Hey, nigga, it's all Jesus my brotha!"
Hahahaha, nigga talkin' 'bout tools, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Awkward, situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard
In my circle when it's awkward
Situation is absurd
Irregular and awkward
Such a feeling is, not heard, awkward
