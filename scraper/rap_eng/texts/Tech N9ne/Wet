[Bridge 1]
I ain't spilling nothin'
And I'm really struttin'
This liquor feel all sudden
Eee-ia-ia-ia
Hit the floor like woah, ain't no tellin' what Bianca fo' sho' my go
Make hella doe like blow but it
Must be that vodka that's making me hot as fuck

[Verse 1]
Look at me I'm sweating like I hit a sherm stick
Fishnet, hairnet to cover my perm bitch
That's how I feel right now, I ain't concerned with the germs
Here to kill right now
I come to terms with the loss of my swisher right when I passed it to a bad bitch
Maybe she'll let me take home that ass, hit and casket it
Functional drunk and I masted it, fast with it
Asking if this chick wanna dip and dap and let me smash it a bit
Talkin' bout wet? Gave her the woop wap she shoutin' out "Tech"
Nina bout to see the proper thing that brought the cream
I'm bout the jeans and I'm bout the zing zing leaders spot
And flee to the block and I free her like a stream
Whole team keep it's hot grits, I do not spit shit if it is not lit
So much liquor mixing in here I might be toxic
Sweating like fire, and bombing fluids where I drop sticks

[Hook]
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
I don't get that stress when I rep that set
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
Must be that vodka that's making me hot as fuck

[Verse 2]
Sweating like I took a dip in the pool
Mixing your liquors'll hit ya, have you tripping a fool
My hitters'll get ya, tryin' flip, ain't tryin' to get to the tool
We ain't boolies, when we bickin' we bool, we on the couch we Tom Cruise
Spillin' Bom booze on shoes
Anybody that test us, you gon' lose
So let's spark a blizzy, take a drizzy, pop a pizzy, get so dizzy
Grab a brizzy, then get busy, Kansas Cizzy in Missizi
Cause the way, my bank account is set up, I can't pay the tab
But after 12 AM I can bread up, then it's on
We'll be gettin' zoned to their moans
DTF ladies comin' to make a poan, we record it with a drone

[Bridge 2]
I ain't spilling nutt'n
And I'm really struttin'
This liquor feel all sudden
Eee-ia-ia-ia
Hit the floor like woah, ain't no tellin' what Bianca fo' sho' my go
Make hella doe like blow but it
Must be that vodka, feel like I'm wearing Chewbacca

[Hook]
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
I don't get that stress when I rep that set
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
Must be that vodka that's making me hot as fuck

[Verse 3]
Don't ever try to be me, yeah
I know what you do when you see me
I'm makin' it look so easy
But you don't really wanna copy me
Don't ever try to be me
Everybody just..
'Cause when we hit the town
It's, goin', down

[Hook]
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
I don't get that stress when I rep that set
In this thang dripping like I'm on we-we-wet
Whole body on my face full of swe-swe-sweat
On my level everybody try'na ge-ge-get
Must be that...
Lovely wet...
