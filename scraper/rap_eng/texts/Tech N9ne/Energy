[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
When I pop up on the track and I bounce to bring it back
To the middle of the west and now I'm 'bout to lean her back
With a thirst of fiend for crack and a burst so mean in fact
And worse to see 'em wreck a team
And I got the steamin' rap that'll make your queen adapt
That make you bring your strap that make you clean your cap
Woulda break the scheme in chapter that'll break N9na clap
The angel wing of Tecca Neen
When I hit it you fuckin' with it, though we gon' be the ticket
To rip off the head of a nigga with the lyrical
Flip off the dead nigga living with a criticism
And if y'all pull it I would never ever credit them
I'm pissed off you sayin' Tecca N9na couldn't spit it
Choppin' your top off in my crazy fitted
Stomp 'em off in a coffin maybe blitish
Bustin' ballin' they be they we wit' it
Nigga the N9na is ahead again
Never been a competitor but see I better take a
The people the energy even when they finicky when they be gimmicky we get to poppin' to rid it
Don't be mocking me bititch I can be livid
Rocking and stoppin' your monopoly, quit it
Walking by to get the guap and be sittin' upon the tippy top and say momma we did it
I am the reala killa, a gorilla nigga
Finna fill a mental, gonna peel a skrilla
Put a mob on the murderer never the talk to loving about peelin' the spilla
What I'ma do with this foolishness dude is rulin' this in every vicinity
Fuck the industry for tryin' to limit me ain't nobody comin' in my phone to get the energy

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
We did it
We, we did it
Whole team stunting
