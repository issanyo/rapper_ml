[Intro]
Chuki
Swahili for hate

[Verse 1]
Found me
When I walkin', the chuki fever all around me
Secretly wanna put the heat to me 'cause of no boundaries I have
See 'em when they peeping me then I laugh
Got a little secret frequently on my cash
When they wanna try to beef with me, in my high hats
Keeping something, never ground me
Exchange, ill looks because Tech stings
Flying over these spectators like the X-Games
Naturally gassing 'em (methane)
Had to be mad when them checks came in set Strange
Passing these raggedy left lanes, wet stains
Silly people, what did I do?
Yelling at you from a high view
Who believed it when they envy, it'll kill you
I do, I do, I do
Chuki nigga try to hide you
From the one he tryna bride (True)
Even though you walking in with a upper-level Mamacita right beside you
Handcuffing they biznitches
This bread ain't fictitious
They quick snitches, in a cop car
I'm a rockstar like Sid Vicious, big riches
They be acting so bootsie
'Cause I made a lot in life they wanna shoot me
Nah nigga not tonight we're quite good, see
Anybody look at you funny because you good with the money, they got

[Chorus]
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it

[Verse 2]
Mad at me 'cause I radically grabbed the baddest b and she added me
To ravish me then automatically we live lavishly
Atti-t-u-d-e from a cop with no grati-t-u-d-e
For a brother 'cause he had a she, who be free
And he so damn staticky
So he went on me and mentally combated me ugh
He say, "I don't know you
I don't know your music
But I like your lady
So don't you abuse it"
Word though, we in a bar and you come in my circle
Tryna flirt bro and you don't know everybody on the earth know
That our purse grow when I burst flow
Flat foot got that chuki, when I snatch coochie
But he that goofy, to act groupie for a fat bootsie
That belongs to the brother of Makzuki
Why you hating on me so?
Mad 'cause I got the beast flow
Steady serving niggas like a bistro
He don't like that banana Rico
Loosely, that's the way of his lips, he talking that dookie
But give her the guy, she gon' deliver the pie like Mookie
Not to no rookie that wears Stussy
But I'm the nigga with the motherfucking lewd B
He wanted me to be dead up but that is really pathetic with that

[Chorus]
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it

[Bridge]
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir
Me sir, me sir, why you mean to me sir

[Chorus]
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
Chuki
You the one that's gon' come down with it (ay)
You the one that's gon' come down with it (chuki)
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
You the one that's gon' come down with it
Chuki
