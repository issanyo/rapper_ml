[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Scooby Doo, I'm groovy, a movie I keep it moving
Keep it pushing from the music to bushes, ain't nothing to me
Here's some gushers for you pussies
You tutti frutti unruly's ammunition for you bitches
You loosey bootie so goonies, yeah
Back up in this rapping, I'm killing all of these rappers
Yeah I'm cooking crush and crumble me cousin
I keep it cracking
Said I'm back up in this rapping, I'm killing all of these rappers
Blood who can brush and run with me buzzing
Let's get it bracking

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
What is understood ain't gotta be explained
So I ain't gotta tell you, I'm a fixture in the game
When I can get to chopping
Ain't no stopping no G shit
I'm for real and I'ma put that on me, bitch

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Gold teeth, gold chain in my sweatsuit
All flame in this thing how Scoob do
So fresh, and I'm 'bout to act a damn fool
So turnt, and I'm breaking all the damn rules
Shit, I'm me, bitch
Certified, can't clone me, bitch
On me, bitch
I'm a five, six, seven OG, bitch

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
Break it down and get it
I'm with it, check the exhibit
Heavy lyrics being lifted, delivered, the boy is gifted
Ain't no difference, just don't mix it
The mission, I'm here to get it
Ain't no friendship
I don't fuck with you bitches, I'm independent
Solo dolo in the paint with the pollo in them bushes
On the low-low, out the way of the po-po
I be pushing
Say you cold, lil homie, I'm colder with the blow
And smell shit when I walk through the door of that manure

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
What is understood ain't gotta be explained
So I ain't gotta tell you, I'm a fixture in the game
When I can get to chopping
Ain't no stopping no G shit
I'm for real and I'ma put that on me, bitch

[Hook: Big Scoob]
Gold teeth, gold chain in my sweatsuit
All flame in this thing how Scoob do
So fresh, and I'm 'bout to act a damn fool
So turnt, and I'm breaking all the damn rules
Shit, I'm me, bitch
Certified, can't clone me, bitch
On me, bitch
I'm a five, six, seven OG, bitch

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Old head hunting for bread, you hear me nigga?
Yeah, no rest, I'm on the edge, you fear me nigga?
In your chest, zip up your vest, I'm hitting niggas
I profess, I am the best, come get it nigga
I'm the sneakest that done did it
I'm witty, I'm with the business
Kansas City is you with me
They hear me, they going silly
I ain't lying, got the heart of a lion
Pushing line past crime
But I'm one of a kind with these rhymes

[Pre-Hook: Tech N9ne]
What is understood ain't gotta be explained
So I ain't gotta tell you, I'm a fixture in the game

Ain't no stopping no G shit
