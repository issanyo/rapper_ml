[Verse 1: JL]
Grade A ganja, burn til it's gone
Doja cologne, OG mist on
Calls to return, my to do list long
But I'm unconcerned, what can you do this blown
Cloudy-eyed stroll, change up my schedule
I roll a couple of 'em up and look what it led to
Not no regular marijuana, that shit is special
Smell the odor, ain't non-smoker inhale a chestful
When I forget about what I gotta do today
Case of a random rap CD used as a doobie tray
Hit the end of the L and tap it til it get threw away
Try to fit the rest of this g of diesel into a J

[Bridge 1: JL]
Kief on my hands
Kush on my pants
Shift in my plans
Task to complete
But passin' some tree
Light that to some heat

[Hook: JL]
I got places to go, people to see, things I should do, somewhere I could be but that's some good weed
Yeah, that's some good weed
You could tell by the look on my face
Ain't no way to hide that I smoke
And it smell as good as it taste
It's like Kush my cologne
Now, that's some good weed

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Cavi Cone, had me blown
Everyday Boombastic - Shaggy song
Make you wanna go and put some turkey patties on
After that you wanna serve your lady daddy long
Taking a cone of Gary Clark Jr. was pivotal
Me and Bouriqua told him, "careful this strain is critical"
They were hospitable, we got on their bus and lit a few
Picked up his new guitar, strumming sounded like syllables
I think I'm trippin', I think it's riffin'
It's talking to me saying words, and ain't no talking, just listenin'
Bus so cloudy I don't think nobody's suspicion is pointing at me twitching like Smokey in the coop with chickens
Liftin' higher, so high I think I'm up with Christians
Out at they show they spirits only existing
Bumped into God and his aura is hella glistenin'
With Gary Clark's face with another spliff he was twistin'
Then I said "Woah, mane. I gotta go, mane that Cavi so strange" and I said that with no shame
I was lit up like propane, tripping over this dope strain
Gary say, "do you think the Cavi is mixed with cocaine?"
I don't know, I don't know
All I know is that it's super fire when I blow
He said thanks for the dough
I said, "have a good show" I was on one and I hope he didn't know

[Hook: JL]
I got places to go, people to see, things I should do, somewhere I could be but that's some good weed
Yeah, that's some good weed
You could tell by the look on my face
Ain't no way to hide that I smoke
And it smell as good as it taste
It's like Kush my cologne
Now, that's some good weed

[Bridge 2: JL]
That's some good weed
That's some good weed (that's some good weed)
That's some good weed (that's some good weed)
That's some good weed (that's some good weed)
That's some good weed (that's some good weed)

[Hook: JL]
I got places to go, people to see, things I should do, somewhere I could be but that's some good weed
Yeah, that's some good weed
You could tell by the look on my face
Ain't no way to hide that I smoke

It's like Kush my cologne
Now, that's some good weed
