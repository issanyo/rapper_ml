[Intro: One Ton]
It's Potluck back again (That's right)
Sayin' that shit you bitch-ass scared to say (Scared to say)
Doin' that shit you scary-ass scared to do (Scared to do)

[Hook: One Ton]
Say what you wanna say, say what you won't say
Do what you wanna do, do what you won't do
Be what I'm gonna be, that's all I got to be
You just a wannabe, so back the fuck up off of me

[Verse 1: Underrated]
Here we go again, it's the veteran, yo we better than
Even your friends are pickin' me over them
Got you breeze on the bed, on her knees givin' head
Wannabe, but you never be what I been
Lyrically, I'm a tank, never gonna quit, cause I gotta represent
Make another hit, puffin' a little bit of the incredible shit
I got your girl on my mind, so I'm fuckin' a bitch
I'm all up in the beat, you pretend to be
And it's better than the yay, cause it's meant to be
Humboldt County is the place where they blaze the weed
I bet you never believe, now take a blaze from me
We gonna stop, drop, rock and roll
Ain't not time to be geekin', we gonna do that though
Flip that ho, kick that flow
Make it to the top, then we get that dough!

[Verse 2: One Ton]
It ain't funny, you don't wanna play games
Ask who's the best, and you better say James
Normal thing, everyday, whoop ass and take names
Sit your five dollar ass down, 'fore I make change
Get you poppin' off, stalkin' the block
All the bitches better know that I'm hot in the spot
Poppin' the Glock, got me a knot
Niggas need to know that I'm walkin' my talk
It's on time, my coast gonna shine, shine, shine
Can't see nigga, blind, blind, blind
One Ton and the J.J. boy, fuckin' three hoes, dime, dime, dime
Haters back up, hoes gon' get smacked up
Holla at the club when I get that love
Hit it from the back while I smoke a fat dub
Then I'm done and I get a back rub

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I'm the nigga with the vendetta, so I can be better, bitch
A motherfucker that run over competitors
No medicine in me, I'm better than many
Sick in the cerebellum, tell 'em a nigga like a sedative
I'mma do what I wanna do, when I do it
You gonna be knowin' the second I do
Because of the rain, because of the pain
Ya niggas, the game, the Tecca Nina's
Vexed and wreckin' your crew
Say what you wanna say, I'm a real
Niggas so give me your dollar bill
Takin' away from me, I'mma kill
Givin' it to me and I'mma chill
Can't nobody stop a nigga from makin' a mill'
If I wanna put the Platinum off in the grill
Maybe tryna find a bitch or two I wanna drill, a nigga will
Be what I wanna be, get from in front of me
If you ain't livin' or doin' what you feel
Only take a minute for me to get up in it, homie
You're a lieutenant, homie and I'm a general
Sendin' you minimal niggas to hell
Used to be makin' criminal mail
Now I'll be makin' critical sails
Never know when I might pop-up
Better hope I never let the Glock bust
Tryna battle niggas, then you got stuck
Ain't nobody fuckin' with Tech and the Potluck!
Take a look around, look at the way I be goin' down
Tecca Nina with the mo' flow
Ain't no fake in the track, nigga, we shakin' the rap
Makin' the tats - snake and the bat logo
Gettin' money, fuckin' bitches on the low-low
Sit her on my dick, and make her play pogo
You can say what you wanna say, Nina fuckin' your bitch
Lookin' like a motherfuckin' clown, nigga, Bozo

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 4: Underrated]
Who be the best? You gon' bet it's me
With the sound underground, no MTV
One Ton, Underrated, we the PLC
Best group of the year and the century
You better let me be, ain't no catchin' me
All the girls get wet when they mention me
When I'm flippin' and rippin' and takin' over control
I bet you thinkin' you better, but you're an idiot though
Get up and go, mayne, you illiterate, bro
Don't you ever be thinkin' you can match the flow
I'm unmatchable, with a sack of dro'
When I'm high, talkin' shit like John McEnroe
We gon' stack the dough, get a 'Lac and roll
Gettin' blown in the back with a naked ho
Cakin' the dough, pack another bowl, move slow
Smoke an ounce 'til my brain cells go!
Bye-bye, we fly, the sky, so high
And where the fuck we from?
Don't die, we cry, West Side, fo' life!
And we gon' do it now
Blowin' up, news style, boom-blowh
Fuck you up, with a look like, "Who Now?"
Got your whole crew shook, when they go down
Flow and grow, we don't know when to slow down!

[Hook] (2X)
