[Intro]
Wicked, wicked, now it's on

[Verse 1: Lejo]
I murder your whole city
Nigga like Frank Nitty - hideous, insidious
Niggas betta give me respect when I flex comin'
Tech flows like amphibians
From here to the Caribbeans
Unexplored territories like Venus
Niggas never seen the team that seems keenest
Impairing your mind like Zimas
Infrared beamers, keep your posse on my penis

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Now it's on
Wicked shit is the link - a middle west flex
The abyss to this bitch who diss this clique
Bliss is hanging that bitch by the clitoris
You get spit on, shit on, hit on, get on
The dick of this slick niggara
But you can always call the N9na
A killer in America - Amerikilla

[Verse 3: Lejo]
I got skills to kill like overdosing pills
Blood spills for million dollar bills
You can't try to peel this or feel the illness
Of a nigga that's coming out real
I don't know why nigga you living a lie
And plus I despise those who try
A nigga like I this high and fly and sly
Midwestside, so you just might die

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Check it out, I murder these hoes, Hercules flows
My shit carries on like hepatitis
The weak biters mean nothing to me
Give me no fuckery foul like (what?)
Nongonococcal urethritis
I might just make a nigga bite dust
When I bust plus calamity feels great
Can it be ill? Yes
Sanity kills a real nigga but still I'm wicked like Amityville
The best: the N9ne? Correct
Burn, now it's your turn, you must learn
Misery niggas are crazed like 24 gang niggas on Sherm
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Tell these punk muthafuckas to leave me alone
When I'm in the zone you get blown away
Get the clones away, Mitch Bade nigga 'cause it's on today

[Chorus]
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on

[Verse 5: Lejo]
Now let me smoke and choke and let these niggas know
That Lejo ain't brought no jokes
Nigga better learn the ropes, we're like Cosa Nostra
And'll fuck around and cut yo' throat
Decapitation facing devastation nations
When they raging can't stop this
Nigga you can catch a fist, and you can rest in piss
But the diss that you thought I missed
I'm indestructible and untouchable
Ain't giving a fuck about what you know
I don't love no ho, I don't mug no mo'
But I'm still collecting my other dough
Now peep the rawness, my rhymes are flawless
Fools get tossed for tryna floss like bosses
People can call this the clique with no losses
'Cause a nigga can flow from September to August
Deeper than seven seas, colder than no degrees
Niggas is easy to get down on your knees
When you fucking with rhymes like these
I always find that he's biting my shit, it's me he's trying to be
No more chances, understand this
I'm the man with the plan I stand from Kansas and this
Weed enhances scandalous dances
What is in my hands will take your last glances
Fucking with a technicality
That's what it gotta be, nigga sitting on the side of me
My mentality makes fatality reality
Split your anatomy, assault and battery
Niggas pray to God we stop; we won't though
Asking who's on the top, they don't know
But don't no motherfucker in the motherfucking western motherfucking hemisphere really want Joe
Associated with a deadly force
We got codes, deeper than Morse, sounds like
And needle points bullet shoot through a horse
So of course, I'm leaving niggas dead like a corpse

*gun shot and sparking*

[Verse 6: Tech N9ne]
Don't test me Beatrice
Another colloquialism I came up with the bitch, peep this twist
People do pitiful shit I do unforgettable hits
And niggas submitted Amerikilla, did it and got
Aquitted, I flip in a minute, I'ma get them relish lips
You can't sell us dips, we get high off K Bombay
Packing hella heat like Pompeii
Itch-May ade-Bay igga-Nay anyway
I gets ill when I feel like gettin' biz
You know what that is? I know what that is
When I be ripping everybody know what that is
Rewind - snomed ni a doG tip
If anybody wanna catch this
I just said "Fuck demons in a God pit" backwards
And that's bomb futuristic attack shit
Match this, takes hella practice
To rips scripts nigga gotta be thorough
I gotta make this shit make sense so I can say, "Made it Ma"
Top of the world
Give me life or give me death
Death becomes the evil like Asmodeus
I got a melodious flow
It becomes odious changeable, untamable angel
Anghellic, bustin' like a Magnum, Tom Selleck
Missouri terror, sick of losing money at Harrah's
Mac assassin like Antonio Banderas
How many niggas you know that bust style?
So ambidextrous and I mean I'm buck wild
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Like I said in the first zone
Accident prone, but these niggas don't wanna flex with Tech when the heat is on
Nigga, now it's gone

[Chorus]
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on
