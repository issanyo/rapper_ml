[Intro]
Yo, it's Mr. hm hm hm hm hm hm hm Tech N9ne
Yo, we're partners against substances baby, like this

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I was was hanging around my 5 7 block off Highland
Skies heaven hot and vibing
Off of T-Will, and a couple of fly brotherin off and rhymin
I spit the wickedest, then I scat with the quickness
Flip it the way I rip it's ridiculous man
I brought the pain
Then im out loud cuz I dated baby like harry on the way
I met a chick named Mary, baby doll was very
Persuasive with the way she spoke
She said some things I couldn't believe she nearly made me choke
She said she'd take me to a higher heightened life
I said id rather be grounded
She said that she'd complete me
But I said I was well rounded
She said I never had a friend like her
Take away the pain
Friend like her
Give me hella fame
When I said never baby doll was astounded
I already know yo game
To drive me to insane
Make me spend all my change
Then try taken away my brain
Baby girl had light green eyes and a hardcore frame
She said her name was Mary, but her last name's Jane, I'll pass

[Chorus] x2
Why these niggas tryin to step to me
All I wanna do is rock the M-I-C
I guess they wanna see me in misery
Never do it cuz it's R.I.P

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Me and skritch scratch outta Don Juan's puttin down hits (yes, yes)
Til a chick came in with a tight all white fit (yes, yes)
She said that once we kicked it with her we would never quit we go loco
We bow fast, What's yo name? she said Coco
She said she's currently staying down in Chouteu
And hides and various houses just to avoid the po po, Coco's a no no
This girl I'll have you spending mo doe
And never ever date a woman with a set of a horns and a pointed tail as a logo
Now Im trippin cuz she said if I really wanna drop bombs
Meet her homie Rock Mon
He stays in Oakland
Raised in Roxens and he'll keep you hype
Im thinkin I will, Im thinkin I might
She's thinking yes, Im thinking more like triple sike
I already know yo game
To drive me to insane
Make me spend all my changw
Then try taken away my brain
Baby girl was a light light bright
And I couldn't explain
Why everybody called her Coco cuz her last name's Cain, I'll pass

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Can I ask you a question?
Have you ever had a homie who was high strung
There's a lot of negativity where I come from
Told the homie to never drink and smoke when drivin' my homie disobeyed, disobeyed
Yo, all I wanna do is get to the studio
Im bumpin it to the weirdest chicks they wantin Poppy Chulo
A block away I bumped into another
She said she wanted to take me on a date
And within the night, become my lover
She's lookin at me like a pirahna
Let loose with me in a sauna
Her title was somethin crazy like ghuana hanna bonana
She said she'd flow like liquid
And wanted to go with me
But she told me to call a GHB, I'll pass baby

[Bridge: Don Juan]
Hey yo, what's up? This is Don Juan
Anybody ask you to do drugs, tell em I'll pass

[Chorus] x2
