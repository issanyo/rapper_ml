This is my haiku

[Haiku: Tech N9ne]
The sick pedophile
Touching beautiful kiddies
Really gonna die

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I think the world needs more light
Cause what they do in the dark too heinous for your sight
And mine is dark all the time
A sign to design true crime
But I'm blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Damn, why wasn't the light on baby girl
Grown men touch her, she four, livin' in this crazy world
That's gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
If I was there, I'd be sparking way more than a light, man
But if we shine em' all, together we can run them off
Gonna hard-slide on everyone he come across
Molotov's go to slavery in the Holocaust
Lotta chalk, you ain't lit up, then you not a boss
Light the darker alleys, it might just spark a rally
For right these hearts are rowdy, tonight we spark the valleys
In flatland's stoppin' the bad man, with grab hands
Girl he groping, go in the trash can
Nowhere to hide I must say places ain't light enough
You try to cut the bright of us an idol just might erupt
The fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
If you got em' then light them up

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
If there was a lighter in everybody's hand
The world would seem brighter
The sky would be fire
We'd raise our hands and burn the world
So raise your hands and burn the world

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hey
Why did Adam shoot the school up?
Maybe cause the way he grew up
Maybe cause of loose screws
Scratch all that, cause mama loved to pick the tool up
Now the marathon blew up
And it's by the hands of two nuts
When Castro took the kids for about ten years and what he done, I almost threw up

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
If them was my youngin's I'd try to bring the sun in
Closer to 'em, turn it up a hundred and hold it to 'em
Take a bite and chew 'em
Some of they baby life they ruined
I'd be going crazy on the daily
Daily I'd pursue them
Don't need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
Barbecue, I would do, right find without all of it
It's awful and off to no resolving it
Molotov's make the night brighter

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Yeah
Depressin' is CNN, was heaven cause we had sinned
The reverend is begging brethren to be sevens and being friends
Tecca don't wanna see kiddies die
Minors on the stretcher, so what you gonna do with them 25 lighters on your dresser
Yes sir, shine them bright so they see us off in Mecca
Lessen the threats of M-F-Er's steppin' with death, impress us
To mess a good will, divide up a fight
Being right and polite, come and help me light up the night
Shine your light bright, pedophile he can't rape her
People stand together, make the place safer
No time to play when I weigh the straight haters
Cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
This is for [censored] that once and often go through my head, then I wanna run then off them
I don't want no second opinion's, so I'm asking her friend
"Just keep it lit so this don't happen again."

[Bridge]
If there was a lighter
The world would seem brighter (brighter)
Fire (fire)
Burn the world
Burn the world

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
A wonderful musician once said:
"If the people who are trying to destroy this world aren't taking a day off, then why should I?"
I feel that
So how do I light up the darkness, Mr. Bob Marley?
This is my attempt right here
I'm trying...
