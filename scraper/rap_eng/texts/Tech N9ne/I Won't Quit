[Intro: King ISO]
I do it for the people who won't quit
You feel me?
We keep pushing

[Verse 1: King ISO]
You ever stand on the edge like you had it up to here?
Wanna give up the drinking but fuck it you grab a couple beers
Wanna relax but end up relapsing and that is just severe
Ready to snap a call back to actions and grab your fucking hair
Really what happened is actually people that become your peers
Ended up stabbing you back to back now you're back to nothing near
'Member the fact of the matter is that they are mad you're fucking here
If I give up there's dissatisfaction so add another year
Stat is what they see, that is what they fear
The strato-sph-ph-phere
Rapping with they N9na, have us left to spear
Trapping plus I'm here I'm talking mental health
The stats who fucking with it
Your Pineal gland the frequencies you haven't touched up here
And niggas play off that new women too
I had to love assure, look at them cut off
Crying shame, had to chuck at tears
I'm just giving facts, off the top
Stab is what you hear
Bar strike a chord like a sword, that's a musketeer
Sad enough the industry's holding me back because I'm here
Even the people that don't even know be noticing that so just be clear
Say don't help me smiling in my face and laugh at the premiere
Actors what appears 'til I go and grab a gun come here
Sleep is coming back, stomach feel the acid up in there
They want me to die, that was with some air
Friends turnin' on me, people I'm supposed to rap with just been weird
My son need his dad
Never will he say daddy wasn't there, mo'fucka

[Pre-Hook: King ISO & (Awaiting Eli)]
All I ever did was show love, so there's some things I don't get
(Woah)
These devils working overtime homie, they don't wanna let Iso live
(So)
I'm knocking on the door of success, one day I'ma slide on in
(Yo)
When the whole damn world go against me
I'ma scream out I won't quit
(No)

[Hook: King ISO & (Awaiting Eli)]
Tell 'em I won't quit
They tell you end your life, I won't quit (I won't quit)
They saying fuck your goals, I won't quit
And they ain't gotta say it, I won't quit
'Cause I already know, I won't quit
'Cause when they think you done, I won't quit (I won't quit)
You got to let them know, I won't quit
Just when they think they've won, I won't quit

[Verse 2: King ISO]
It's like the further I get the more
Murderous hits just thoughts occurring again
I'm certain to get too sore
Now hurt limit is your
Not surfing and when
They lurking to get ya boy
But you're gonna get annoyed
'Cause we're gonna win
I urge you to quit you're going to get merked and then destroyed
The nerve of you bitches serve as a bigger ploy
I'm urging 'em with the noise
That's earning me tips
I'm permanent with this knowing
Nervousness hits will get deployed
Never will I be the one to be giving up anything nigga if it's a choice
They gonna have to come murder me, simply attackin' me, shakin' me, strip my voice
I don't know why people try to hold me back
Been to hell so many times, I promise I ain't going back
Did so many favors, where my homies at?
Some owe me racks
I pull up bussin' doing donuts all up in your culdesac
Homegirls turning into groupies, tell that hoe relax
I can't trust a single soul, in case no one has noticed that
Got enemies in the industry and in the streets I want to clap
Done made my ass a maniak, man shout out to the brodie Kash
They making the mentally disturbed question if we matter
So should I stand over your grave with a weak bladder?
I should've been paid, they know that I eat rappers
And hating niggas can eat lead, delete backwards
Once I get a machine behind me, I'll wreak havoc
And pull the rug from under you niggas that bring static
So when you see Iso wiling like he's spazzing
Because everybody's trying to stop him and he's had it, mo'fucka

[Pre-Hook: King ISO & (Awaiting Eli)]

'Cause I already know, I won't quit
'Cause when they think you done, I won't quit (I won't quit)
You got to let them know, I won't quit
Just when they think they've won, I won't quit

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I been a blessing but Tech is looked at like I'm devilish by some
But I was beckoned in Heaven to the Earth on a curse better lick my dung
They don't want to step into death and be hurt, reverse never does my tongue
We the best in this effin', be wordy careful I get my gun
And that is your therapy
Calling click clack is your clarity
And rap is a rarity, when N9ne is rapping numerically
One for the evil and two for the people that's running with 'em like he's such a messiah
The three and the four and the fever at the non-believers
Split 'em like a fuckin' papaya
The kings in this bitch
KC to Nebraska we blast at pity bastards
No esteem in this shit
The theme in this hit
Is about me and Iso what they dream in this script
By the one with a mic go write so mean and it's lit
'Cause I'm on the other shit, they wanna fuck a bitch
I wanna trip with the money then get with the homies and having enough to split
They got to bust a clique
Sick of 'em tryin' to be us it's such a trip
When they be telling me they wanna get with the family they better suck a dick
Real steel with a psycho
Is when you keep rapping and little happens, but you think it still might go
'Cause your homies say you got a tight flow
But that shit ain't nothing but a lot of huffin'
In fact you suckin' like Lipo
I won't quit until the day I go
Four years more, me and Kali shoot as high as the sky yo
Then it's bye though
Know buddies I leave it to JL, Joey, CES, Mayday, Stevie, and Iso

[Outro: King ISO]
Fuck a hard life can knock you down homie
It's about getting back up
Won't quit homie
Iso
