Hits ya harder than Thorazine
Shock wit a bit of that knockin'
Teachin' Caca bean
Tech gonna eat you minions
With some motherfucking fava beans
Running them away like Tyrus
Straight gang nigga like Cyrus
No shiners in my iris
Got me a generation
Hemmed up with the virus
Infectious
While even rolling in your Lexus
G, clear the hexes
Creeps me from here to Texas
Lets get deep
Into the pavement
I be the topic
Ultra-microscopic
Infected agent
No vaccination
Rapidol
Make that information attachable
Leaving spreading through
Out the nations capitol
Ya spouse may
House gate
An about-face
Can't save you from this motherfucking outbreak
The virus
Infects k-i-d's
Rounds twos and threes
All the way up to OG's
With Alzheimer disease
See Dolores tried immigation
But we don’t need no medication
For the sensation
Just the marijuana lacin'
Let the music take your mind
Press rewind
The venom is in 'em that Tecca N9ne combined
Let my virus up in you
I love fiends
So open up your pores for daddy
And let me swim through your blood stream

(Chorus)
We don’t need no medication
You can buy this virus
Come and try this
Killa style y'all
Shit's like a motherfucking Midol
We don’t need your drugs at all
Sold it to you fools
Stronger than boo boos
Pick and choose
Whatever moves you
Junkie ew ew
Whatcha gonna do

Nigga you puffin marijuana
Me puffin marijuana
I'm peeping the futuristic
Ballistic brain bumma
Hella contagious
You been fair warned
I got a gang of radio stations
Making me airborne
No bulimia, leukemia nor sickle-cell anemia
My virus may cause encephalitis
But it may cause panties scream-a-ya
Make em wanna give up the Virginia
Tecca Ninna ya plus ya blood stream
And ya equals no to me to be greedy
But a large amount of you are legimia
I'm spreading shit that will get you exile
Protect our styles
Up in the Generation X Files
Lets prowl
Through hoes drawers
I told y'all I'm making rouge dogs
Shh-boo-ya-sha-boo
Ya roll call
Bizarre flows
B-r-o's bar codes
Sick individuals that God see and Lord knows
They stay by me
Cause my virus ain't a fake I.D
Snake I be
Wit venom ain't no curing like HIV

(Chorus)

Futuristic man
I start to lack the corruptage in this
Suffer Lucifer for the busters who fucking wit this
Who said
I'll awaken the dead
Told me that I would spread
Like a plague
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Infecting you in 2k
The year God conquered the virus but to they
Injected fuck up in ya no matter what who say
Spreading hella fast kickin' ass like juve
Lets party nigga
Ladies lift your dress
This new world rapper got you flashin'
Showin' my bar code on your breast
Science will keep it going when I'm gone
Cheap in '97 but in '90 Nina Tecca N9ne clones
Hopefully Obi-Wan Kenobi will help me spread it
Out your sockets
Into your fiber optics
Mr president look around
I got a sea of anarchists
To shut this motherfucker down
The virus

(Chorus)
