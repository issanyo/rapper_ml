[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
11/8/71 mama brung the gun to this world
And ever since it's been tons of fun
Leavin' bitches stun off in they lungs I come, hella spun
Give her the slap on the buns and run
I got money mane, gimme dumby dames
Make her honey drain a funny thang her tummy pains
All I want is sex drugs and rock n' roll
Rap and liquor, flockin' hoes
Got the drop and I lock and load
Haters can fuck off, flee with ya tough talk
This is no mercy thirsty for blood and I bust off
I am the reason they find you stiff with ya nuts off
Cut cross and dusted off for yappin' too much boss
Rules don't apply to me, America lie to me
So ain't no way you containing this devil inside of me
And ya children they love it, how I'm rebel and rugged
If it ain't about the way that I can clutch a ducket motherfuck it

[Hook]
Bad's in town (You can't get rid of me)
Nab stand down (Might as well let it be)
7 hound (Baby it's in my blood)
Cash and crowns (I'm everything you're thinkin' of)
I am everything you ever were afraid of
(A nightmare there he go right there)
I am everything you ever were afraid of
(Very mean bitch I am everything)

[Verse 2: Hed P.E.]

Punk I know my enemy the devil he can't control me niggas
I am everything that you fear I mean I don't give a fuck
(Hed) P.E. Tecca Nina we fuckin' pussies up
Your daughter disappears we fuck her in her ears
Monster flow and I'm voted the nigga of the year

[Verse 3: D-Loc]
Hold me down let it loose when I rip call it truce
Feelin' good, feelin' fine, hit him off every time
Let 'em have it then I grab it, duck you down
Lay you down when I'm pimpin' when I'm sippin' meet me in that bed while
So you think you fuckin' with a Kottonmouth, D-Loc Killa
When I get 'em once you rip 'em hold me down watch me pill 'em
D-Loc said it now you know, now you know D-Loc said it

[Verse 4: Kottonmouth Kings]
I'm a savage renegade terrorist infidel
White devil gen top and I'm raisin' hell
I'm wide awake there ain't no need for no sleeper cell
I'm the bomb and the anthrax in the mail
On the side lock death, pour the Kool-Aid
White light, voodoo magic of the black plague
I'm the blood that you drink from the poison well
The drug of choice I am fear you know me well
I'm that that go bump in the night - it's me
Rollin' around town smokin' a blunt or a pipe with me
(Hed) P.E. Kottonmouth Kings and Tecca N9ne yes we
Insomnimaniacs we rulin' the night just like
Freddy Krueger or that psycho Michel Meyers (Yeah)
[?] So you better play nice
Half a bottle and always startin' up a fight
[?] Strange Music what you gonna do cry?
