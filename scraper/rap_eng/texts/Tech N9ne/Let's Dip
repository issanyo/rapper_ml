[Intro]
Will, will, will, will, will you go with me?
Come home, dip with me
Will you go with me?

You looking like ya want me I see you I see you
My perfect kinda woman, I want you, let's dip
(Like this)

[Hook x4]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah don't trip
I know you just met me but, let's-let's dip

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on, come on, I bought a couple drinks
And I spent a couple dollars, baby tell me what you think
I know yo head right, shit my head right too
Caribou Lou, ain't no telling what we gon' do now
She's in the midst of a Christopher mack
If she interested I'm thinking of taking her back to the pad with me (pad with me)
Hit it til the nabs get me
She wasn't planning to be bad but I got the gift of gab with me (bang out)
Shall we, make the night better
All the bitches tripping see us leaving together
They wanna get on but they can get on they wasn't tripping on me
When I wasn't the big homie of the show me
Shit, what you gon' show me (Back it up)
Put some weight on that for me
(Hold me)
Who me, oh Kali
No doubt baby, now put your arms around me let's dip

[Hook x4]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah don't trip
I know you just met me but, let's let's dip

[Bridge]
Everybody
You have been invited to a sexy party
It only requires you be getting naughty
I think you're on fire baby your a hottie, ladi dadi

[Verse 2]
The back of a spectacular
Thinking of sinking my teeth in like Dracula
Baby no I'm after her
And after this is over come over
Let me do them things that I whispered in your ear's what I told her (that's what I told her)
Don't give me that cold shoulder
Don't hesitate I know that I don't know you
I'm something to see
So don't bring your girl 'round me
True player for real ask N-9-N-E (Tech N9ne!)
That's how the fat boys get laid
Stran-ge nigga, now I'm bout to get paid
So we can go and have a one night stand
My man's and them is handling yo girls, so let's abandon them and dip

[Hook x4]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah don't trip
I know you just met me but, let's let's dip

[Verse 3]
He's tryna stop it from going on baby
Don't wanna trip in ya bed and not let him listen to the song baby
'Cause Kaliko is tryna dip into that salad bowl
He ain't tryna to have it, though but he ain't gotta know
Cause you going with me
151, Sprite and a Pisces and you rolling with me
Tip-toe out the back, do-don't even trip
Don't tell him who you with give that nigga the slip and let's dip

[Hook x4]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah don't trip
I know you just met me but, let's let's dip
