[Verse 1: Skatterman]
I know I told you I was on my way, baby I'm tryin'
I didn't intend to hurt ya, lil' mama quit cryin'
Made promise after promise 'bout us spending more time
But now it's painfully obvious that I was just lyin'
And you be made at me, tellin' your friends that you ain't fuckin' with me
Truth hurts, and the truth is you can't do nothin' with me
You make plans, and make dates, but I always break 'em
Your family's havin' barbecues, and I can't ever make 'em
You buy me gifts every month, but I don't ever take 'em
Friends try to trail me through the club, but I always shake 'em
You say you hate my ghetto ways, 'cause I'm from the streets
I got you cookin' up a meal, that I don't come to eat
Now I'm talkin' 'bout comin' to rip your thong off
10 minutes later, you call me, I turn my phone off
My life's messy, plus you think I stick my dick in anything sexy
That's why my last bitch left me, I'm a...

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & (Skatterman)]
Heartbreaker (heartbreaker)
Bread maker (bread maker)
I'm a hustler (I'm a hustler, baby) I'm from the street, I'm a
Go-getter (go-getter)
Gorilla (gorilla)
Go figure, that's the way that I'mma be, I'm a
Heartbreaker (heartbreaker)

[Verse 2: Snug Brim]
Love you a superstar, you want the glamour life
You heard that time with a rapper is something like Vegas nights
I could show you the world, take long expensive flights
Or dip your body in pearls, mami that's what ya like
Don't get attatched to me lady, baby I stick and move
Little romance when I'm stoned, but you can keep your dude
You know how playas do, bitch save your attitude
Be satisfied with twice a month, unless I'm mad at you
Patiently waitin' on me, wishin' I hit the scene
You got my usual ready, a fifth of [?]
Plus some yadadameans tryna win me over
But that'll never happen, baby I'm a soldier
Money stay on my mind, that's word out on the streets
So please don't call on my phone, listen, ya stressin' me
I might pull up in a minute, I got your recipe
Make sure you heart is on your shoulder, tryna get next to me

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & (Skatterman)]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Damn! Why do you gotta be actin' like you don't know that I'm a playa 'cause baby I am!
I keep an abundance of bitches, I see 'em, sex em and I slam!
Pardon me ma'am!
I know that you probably want me to yourself
I'm an incredible man!
Just 'cause you glam! Don't mean that you fam!
I'm pop a nut, I get 'em off and I scram!
Holla back at me when you get your head right
Bein' with you is a dead sight
Naggin' and bitchin'
You missin' dickins, 'cause I'm fuckin' hella bitches ev'ry night
Excusin' me French? Miscuisy? Bein' with Tecca Nina is a doozy
'Cause I'm a heartbreaker, baby heart taker
And you know I'm off in the jacuzzi
Got my dick in the mashed potatoes tonight
The bigger the playa the greater the fight
Missin' the other bitches got you stuck
And you plannin' to jack off later tonight
Go girl and play with your dildo
Sittin' by yourself [?] real low
'Cause I'm kickin' it, you can even eat a [?] mistake [?]
I was born this way, bitch I'm special
Maybe a character trait of a devil
I am the rock of Gibraltar, you bein' soft, that makes you a pebble
So you can kick it and be with me, get up and flee with me
Baby just be with a boss
Just know I ain't gonna be with just one
I'm a son of a gun, if you're trippin', you're done, you lost

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & (Skatterman)]

[Outro]
Heartbreaker, bread maker, I'm a hustler
Go-getter, gorilla, go figure
Heartbreaker, bread maker, I'm a hustler
Go-getter, gorilla, go figure
