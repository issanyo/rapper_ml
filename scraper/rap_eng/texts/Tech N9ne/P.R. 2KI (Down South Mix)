[Intro: Tech N9ne]
It's hotter than them bitches sitting up in the free clinic, nigga
You know what I'm sizzlin'?
It's time to get this party started right, baby
Ah, my name, they call me
(DUH DUH-DUH DUH), Tech N9ne
And I uh, need a Caribou Lou
Uh, that's 151 Malibu Rum and pineapple juice
You know what I'm sizzlin?
You don't know what that is?
You can't get the party started without that!
Let's do it!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You want me to jam I'm finna enter
Brain waves came from insane days
Make ya sick like bad mayonnaise
(Tech N9ne!) Got the remedy rhyme infinity
Criminally finna be some shit
I crack you open like the youngest male Kennedy
Got the whole planet rockin' off the low blows dammit
I show flows and poke hoes that's 'posed to be yo's
Seein' my haters in a dark alley tormented by mind
Dodgin' the (Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech - N9ne, Tech, Tech, Tech)
Now here's the message
Liberate me, Chocolatate'
Take 'em and rock now play
Do the fuck what I say
Throw ya souls in the air like this
Flash ya bar codes while I stick 'em
With another hit up out of the abyss
The Tech N9ne Nina out to find vaginas
Just the playa clubbin' it, rubbin' it
Lovin' that crema streama, might seem a little extreme
My thing when I flips I gots to make sho' that it's hot
And make the whole planet rock like this

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Make that ass hop, don't stop!
Down south Biancs make the planet rock
Midwest!
Too much ass in one room
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-boom
Make that ass hop, make that ass hop
All the ladies in the party make the planet rock
See that ass hop, watch that ass hop
All the fellas like to see you make the planet rock

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Hahaha you played too much ass for me baby
Slow it down right here

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Call it what you want it, ghetto futuristic come get up on it
There's a bianc up in my sector, can I bone it?
'Cause all we want to do is get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts, and fuck hoes
We quick to beat a buster down bad
MidWestSide put me in the sound lab
Now I'm (*demonic noises*)
I flip it backwards for you flow snatchers
Blast y'all in the ass, Nina playin' fast ball
Crash all glass jaws
Mad y'all 'cause last call I was in the back of the club
Bangin' the hell outta this bad broad
On my planet we take no haters for granted
They Kris Kross (10 seconds 'til lift off)
Be soaked in pistol grip sauce, ripped off
The technique's complete heat
Retreat 6 feet under 6 feet
Unique speaks, freaks tweek
Never let the BCs can it
While the trooper Tecca Nina rock the planet, planet

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Make that ass hop, don't stop!
Down south Biancs make the planet rock
Midwest!
Too much ass in one room
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-boom
Make that ass hop, make that ass hop
All the ladies in the party make the planet rock
See that ass hop, watch that ass hop
All the fellas like to see you make the planet rock

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Hey partner I got a wild one here man
See if you can come help me with this mane
It's all delicious, baby

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I got the type of flow to make 'em make Scream 3
Six rappers being hunted by a killa MC
I never killed a bianca with a 36D
A party with the bitches on my planet lookin' crispy
Swiftly makin' rappers do 360s (Never knew three 6s)
Other niggas tryna diss me be (Under these prefixes)
Non ill mal-functional (N9ne!) Rambunctional
Never let up on a heated mic 'til I'm comfortable, Rogue style
57th-56th Street Gang, grips we gain
Anybody wanna trips we bang
Hit us with a what? Lyrical head splitter
Makin' hella hoes get a nut
Make 'em put the rolls in they butt
Let a ho be a slut
Negaro never give a fuck
"Why the attitude? Nina ross you got the sauce"
Nigga, I'm mad 'cause the Chiefs lost, I'm pissed off
In Kansas City, I'm straight from the abyss, Tech N9ne!
I got the planet rockin' with me
Whole planet rockin' like this

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Oh, nigga back up, I didn't know that was your woman
All the broke-ass playa haters be quiet (yeah)

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Make that ass hop, don't stop!
Down south Biancs make the planet rock
Midwest!
Too much ass in one room
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-boom
Make that ass hop, make that ass hop
All the ladies in the party make the planet rock
See that ass hop, watch that ass hop
All the fellas like to see you make the planet rock
I can tell that you can tell that I'm twisted
By the bulge in my pants so let's do it baby like this
