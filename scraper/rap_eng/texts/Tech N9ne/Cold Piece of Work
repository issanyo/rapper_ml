[Intro]
Strange Reign 2017...

[Pre-Chorus: JL]
They treat my bidness like it's soda
Or my music like a perc
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Verse 1: JL]
That's dope nigga what you call a buzz when you caught a bus
I make you feel like you was on all the drugs
All the drugs, drugs, I got all the plugs
A-A-All this was to satisfy the customers
It'll hit you different depending on what we pay you
Pop it then the check the purity side effects of it fatal
Now you know that when you blow niggas wanna know what they pay you
(Fo sho') N-N-Noses in my bidness like a yayo!
Flippin' like it's crack and can't relax it's like we drug dealers
Or sit in psyche or SEG, I'm servin' sinking this and sink with nerves
Cook 'em like it's smack is what they slappin' when they get the urge
Keep 'em coming back we push these packages to listeners
Word

[Pre-Chorus: JL]
They treat my bidness like it's soda
Or my music like a perc
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Chorus: JL]
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
T9X is what they sniffin' when Tech Nina get to spittin'
My position is give 'em a hell of an addiction
On these scripts and they be itchin'
For the good dope that I be dishin' out for the listenin'
That's why I'm constantly cookin' off in the kitchen
Nigga I'm Mr. Molly, when Nina shit hits her body
It takes her and gets her naughty
Fella mixed it with liquor prolly
She'll love you and lick your lolly
Taking me is her hobby
She flipping through my discography, nigga
Then she swallow me, nigga
Buss serves on them bitches steady searchin' for the sickness
If you want it Nina's on it with the quickness
Shit is real not ficticious all the wishes for the bomb
You can get it from the Don P, I daze you like a whippit
Nigga I'm addictive

[Pre-Chorus: JL]
They treat my bidness like it's soda
Or my music like a perc
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Chorus: JL]
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope!

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
I'ma let two of my young gunners work this motherfucker
Jay Trilogy and Joey Cool
Go!

[Verse 3: Jay Trilogy]
Okay I've been taking my time since 8th grade
You niggas been having it easy for the past 6 years
Don't believe me motherfucker? Wait 'til I release my CD
I'm a cold piece of work
They tryna find a cure for me but I'm pure disease
I'm infecting the industry first, ain't nobody safe from me
Bitch I'm great
I'm not the plug but I got that work bitch, don't try to test me
I got verses that could put everybody in a hearse so I feel I deserve it
I'm only 19 but be warned
My flow so dope a motherfucking fiend would avoid
Heard about this shit on the street giving niggas instant OD
Oh lord
So you just caught a glimpse and you low-key high as a bitch
Don't trip, I'ma try to fix this shit
If I go too hard, you might just flip your shit
So take a few deep breaths while I inject infectious rhythm in your system
Have you bouncing through the roof, catch a groove if you with it
Aye
Asking me if I think I'm the goat
Okay I admit it, I see the future and that's all that is in it
I put in the work, so I know I'ma get it
You digging a ditch for yourself if you step to the kid, give a fuck about wealth
Give a fuck about numbers, a fuck about charts, I will eat you alive and that's straight from the heart
And a rock in a hard place, help me get it ever?
Broke as a bitch and I need that cheddar
Mozzarella and the provolone et-cetera
I don't really know which one is better of the three
And I don't give a fuck just hand it over
I ain't ever going back to my day job
When I quit, man, I quit for a lifetime
Called my old managers over tell him, "Man I told ya"
I'm worth more than gold and I know that shit
Tryna put me on a payroll, hold my dick
I'm doing what most of the world fears everyday
That's a cold piece of work, better fix your face when you're mentioning Jay

[Verse 4: Joey Cool]
If you ain't ever heard of Coolie, you 'bout to get the connection
I'm narcotic, pharmaceutical, potent antidepressant
I alleviate what antidotes heal and aging what's stressing
I'm like Lucy in the sky with the diamonds
My effervescence is infectious
Most definitely, deathly defiant
I'm a motherfucking giant, a tyrant, a modern pirate
I might throw a fucking party next Friday, you're all invited
Mr. Molly said he might be attending, bitch get excited!
Lace boots with the rhyme skills
I don't even need the lights on
So dope that I'm like pills
Burna cut the fucking mic on
Coolie Baby, I been rocking with the nigga
Hella tatted with the ice on
Gold teeth with the gold chains
Own thang, got the hood, I'm home
Put the swank on a nigga real quick
You are at the bottom of the sea-saw
Bank on a nigga being mine
Goin' back and forth like it's ping-pong
Stay with me get you realigned, this'll be divine, it's a theme song
Godzilla be up on the punishment
And I might slap the shit up out of King Kong
See the team strong
I been chopping and talking with Nina, he told me I'm ready
Aim at the target, the scope on the lock on this bitch
And I'm holding it steady
Taking precaution, I'm deadly
Bumping that good Everready
Shit is so down, it's steady
Fuck it, I'm Joey Andretti

[Pre-Chorus: JL]
They treat my bidness like it's soda
Or my music like a perc
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work

[Chorus: JL]
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope nigga
That's dope
They know my flow is the yola
That's a cold piece of work
