[Chorus]
They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

[Verse 1]
I re-member this fool I used to work with
Somebody I used to trust and even sold work with
Spectacular how people love this black vernacular
But back in your talkin' he's the one who takes the first lit
Unbeatable, seem like was nothing that could stop this fool
Seem like nobody up in the hood could ever drop this fool
I can hear "I'll beat a nigga, I shoot a nigga, I kill a nigga, I'll do a nigga"
But ain't nobody ever seen this nigga roll up no magazine
'Till one day, on a Sunday, in a Hyundai
Some niggas in the park at back of the ride I stepped outside I was gon' play
I said "wattup" they said "wattup" looked at my boy said "wattup"
The toughest nigga in the universe ain't givin' a fuck
I'm stuck in between, heaven and hell and hells seems to lean
My way no heaven's highway this ain't my day-ay-ey!
Punk-ass nigga won't jump at me punk out
Just me and my opponent start to burnin' like ? I'm on it
But check out the way it turned out
Them niggas rushed me and my softie partner burned out
I got my ass beat, in the middle of the street
I was still alive and I told ya 'bout this soft-ass cotton soldier

[Chorus]
They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

[Verse 2]
You wanna know, who's made of cotton?
It's that busta with that rich? and yo illegal plottin'
Sittin' at home then thinkin' wondering how much time you facin'
Nigga done told the whole shabang up in interrogation
No escapin' unprotected I'm servin' cause this rat bastard mastered
The art of tellin' from killings to dope sellings
My (?) is stone, aggravation is grown
Cause now I recall when the cops said
Hands on the hood, put down the goods
Keep all the merchandise right here, come on!
Heard the snitch is up in Camerun stammerin'
Cause niggas know a snitch, will end up dead or become somebody's bitch
Think of how it's, funny seein' him singin' ballads
(?) next minute he's tossin' the motherfucking salad
I was told, cotton swab-ass niggas catch blows
Supposed to be rough and then froze
Said he was down but now I'm downtown awaiting trial in my cell
I can't wait to fold your soft-ass cotton soldier

[Chorus]
They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)

[Verse 3]
Just like a Mitchell Bade, you're such a Mitchell broad
Cotton soldiers be from here to Cape Cod your whole facade's
Unbelievable, I'm illegal so, hand me the gat
'Cause this cotton soldierâ€™s making actions like Sammy the rat
If I'm in despair, I expect you to have my back
And kick some ass like a motherfucking democrat
But you procrastinated, now you become belated
(?) Ghandi's hated, I'm gun associated
I stated, the cotton soldiers get the '86 cause (?)
And (?) in '96 will get them niggas highly kicked
In '97 we wettin', cotton swabs
If you had to be rough to work a shift nigga I'd be stoppin' jobs
I spits the real niggets and I leave your stom like bumblebees
Some of these, like wet niggas go away like tumbleweeds
Go away like humble Gs, don't be tryin' to moulder
(?) that means he'll be a cotton soldier

[Chorus]
They ain't on your side, the look in they eyes'll
Let you know when you funkin' they gon' hide from the ride
A cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
You looked on my side, he stood right beside
But who's the first wabbacotton to slide when he die
The cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
Cotton soldier, cotton soldier (Mitch Bade nigga)
