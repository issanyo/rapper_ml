[Intro: Tech N9ne (Spoken)]
You muthafuckas think we gonna stop keepin' on
We shall prevail
Muthafuckas fear what they do not understand
And what they do not understand they try and destroy
Come on now

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I hear 'em whisperin' in corners speakin' dirty talk on us
'Bout how we too grown up, that we unknowners
And my persona is Rock 'N Rollish yo' nigga told us
Every word that you quoted
Said I wouldn't be the one that sold it, but HA we exploded
I'm that rap nigga that you heard with 2Pac, Sole
Lynch and Bo, Wake Up Show wit' King Tech and Sway
Yukmouth, Thicker Than Water, Gang Related, Eminem
Roger Trout, MC Ren, nigga Spice-1 and them
Hit 'em wit' a venom send 'em down kill 'em when I spit
When I get a bit of scrilla Tech is givin' niggas shit
Love 'em love us but the playa hatin' niggas betta split
It'll neva be another Tecca Nina when I quit
You better kneel when you hear a nigga that's real
I feel 18 when I bust from the grill
Because, (if you keep it young)
Yo song is always sung
So street life taught me to keep 'em sprung
God sent me to kill, lyrical scripts
The miracle whipped you demons and hatas who tripped
Listen I really feel, my Villain T-Will when he spit
Fuck them plus anybody they go get, and shit

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
The storm consumes all the sun and moon fall
On you Sodom and Gomorrahian Gregorian chanting RuPauls
Extreme case of blue balls 'cause you bang
Got fruit all in his veins
What I'm sayin' is I will reign murder you all in His name
Biss malla wit' the fist in a pistola
Dismiss the kiss from a hiss giva
Wrist slita male bitch or witch wit' a twist
A glitch man abyss swimma, trick
I will never slide, never fall, never fail
Never the devils side, ever call, never hell
But I got these muthafuckas prayin' for my downfall
But the orange hair means time to clown y'all
Thanks to Jenny I'll get the message to many
The circus is comin' and gunnin' wit' plenty
I heard Vell Bakardy got a poster of me burnin'
To get his earnin' concernin' not I killed him but he ain't learnin'
Nigga you couldn't burn me with acid or in a firey pit
You couldn't burn in a volcano were lava is spit
You couldn't burn me if you damned me to hell where Satan sit
The only way you can burn me is wit' ya bitch nigga

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Why don't you niggas keep ya mouth shut
Without us you clout sucks you doubt us and get ya mouth bust
We veterans and better then you young cheesy cheddar men
Bouncin' across the nation and you home watchin' Letterman
I'm the nigga that got 'em listenin I know it's sickenin'
To know I'm the nigga that got your girlies coochie glistenin'
From listenin' to my shit and when I get her for christenin'
She splits again 'cause I made her spit the nitro glycerin
I'm on you, callin' me a old negro
But I don't know a young nigga that could hold me though
Plus the dough be low, average and I hold the glow
But they want me to fall so they can say "I told you so"
But if I'm mutli punks would say I just lucked up
Keep talkin' that shit might getcha fucked up
You some Jimmy Rucker, Tommy Tucker type of muthafuckas
Glamorize and specialize in gettin' butt fucked
Niggas think they dope then gonna try to check me
I'm here to let yo ass know you need to respect me
'Cause although you ain't sayin' shit you gettin' on my nerves
I'ma keep on keepin' on mufucka that's word

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on
You can pray and prey for my downfall
When I rise like the sun I ain't fuckin' wit' y'all
I'ma keep on keepin' on, keep on holdin' on

[Post-Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They say I don't fit in
But I won't listen
You can say what you wanna
I'ma come up from a
Life a livin' gutta
I have to be no otha
You can say what you wanna
I'ma come up from a
Life a livin' gutta
I have to be no otha
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on
Keep on, keepin' on, keep on, holdin' on

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
So now do you understand?
Is the picture clearler?
Heh...fuck y'all niggas
