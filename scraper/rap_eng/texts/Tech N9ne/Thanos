[Intro: Josh Brolin]
You should've gone for the head
You know what it's like to lose?
To feel so desperately that you're right
Yet to fail nonetheless
Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same
Now it's here or should I say
I am

[Verse 1: King Iso]
Ninja, they call me senpai so
I'm back on the block, a nigga used to [?] Iso
When I'm blackin' on tracks, now I be packin' these raps cards
I line 'em like a crackhouse trying to get my dough
Bitch I be killing 'em with all of the venom like a symbiote
Nigga be tripping but they be invisible like I was dissed by ghost
I remember rapping and starving like "bitch I'm broke"
Not a giant gotta fee homie bitch fi-fo
So why in the fuck you wanna trip with this psycho
Catch me walking outside of the club with ten white hoes
Tricks go, six rifles, my bitch like "oh"
You forgot to zip it up, and I'm like "bitch I know"
With this eye blackened route
The bitch like "woah"
'Cause these days do niggas wanna fistfight? No
Like Eastbay, I'm finna get a gig like gold
My cheese grate, no pun intended, it's thy GOAT

[Verse 2: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Ride with a shotgun close to me
Death on the block and a hearse to see
Life in jeopardy, what is death to me
I burn worse than the third degree
My skin decrepit, sick with sepsis
Mentally I've gone insane
Infection from injection, fully clouding my brain
Peeling layer after layer of your skin with a grin
Make a mask outcha high way
You resign while you fully alive
Grip you in the eyes while you taking your last breath
Your worst nightmare, hearing dead flesh
I am the ghost and never rest

[Verse 3: Bukshot]
Here's a story that I like to tell about
About the villains that you know so well, yah
Rot my homies, we come straight out of hell
Everyone who opposed instead every one of 'em fell, yah
I give a fuck about these people who ain't down with us
We only ride with juggernauts who banging down the bust
I make that call to pull the trigger, drop that missile on 'em
Hitting bodies, disconnected like a broken bone

[Verse 4: Jelly Roll]
Bitch that bump bump bump
So put this in yo trunk
We been doing this a while
Better tell 'em buck buck buck
They say totem pole done overdosed
He's going broke, he's overboard
Word on the low, from so and so
He's snorting coke and blowing tours
I won't play for nothing
Majik Majik gangstas coming
Attitude is saying fuck it
Bad temptation, David Ruffin
Dudes who hate it, ladies love it
Jealous ass hating busters
Tell them motherfuckers if they want it
They can take it from us

[Verse 5: CRUCIFIX]
My name alone is murder
Big death my bride
Reality's a burden, you fucking died
Better learn your place
Get up out my space and before my town
Is tabooed and clock on this track
Too bad they can't rap no match for my mind
I'm like a pot if a dish in the trip of the cup of the sipper
The fitter to the top of the spitter
The blood that the fitter been fucking your feelings
Is instead the killer y'all fuckboi villains
I'm on edge and the Cortez keep the concept
Leaning on the fucking world like an armrest
Bitch I'm a boss, step inside my fucking gauntlet

[Verse 6: Boondox]
This time I lost my mind
Soaring gone and I can't rewind
In a space where I really wanna waste
Typa every motherfucker ever been alive
And I see the signs and I'm warping your reality
Wanna snap my finger on these bitches
I'm busting galaxies, and I'm busting fallacies
Snapping nobodies with the power of a paycheck
Tryna claim you a big deal?
Still a motherfucker ain't never been paid yet
Keep on talking that shit bitch and I see you at Emory
When I'm on my Thanos
We're like handles eating your memory

[Verse 7: Krizz Kaliko]
I got the rocking control of the pill
Even if I'm in my suit pants
I'm moving forward while you standing still
Like you was doing the shoot dance
Maybe I'm crazy or mentally ill
This shit I'm seeing is stupid
I go bananas, you niggas the peel
Matter of fact more like a fruit stand
If you turn on the TV and flipping the channels
See me and peep me like you were La Banos
I do it speedy in jeans and the flannels
No I do it big, no-no I do it Thanos
Get in the game if you niggas is playing
Like how do, how do, how do you gag
If you gonna be hating me all over my face like
No no no no no not you again

[Verse 8: Claas]
You don't wanna go to war with us, raw spitters
Don't nobody wanna battle when I'm coming with them warriors
You're quitters
I'ma leave 'em underground in a hole
That I dug for anybody thinking they can put the chest out
You don't wanna take a left
Matter fact, think about it really care about it
Go on and pick the best route
Before you go on and put your neck out, what is on the line
Ain't nobody got the motherfucking time for your bitch games
See you on a pump gun when I'm done
I'ma have you looking like I went to town with a switchblade
Y'all ain't nothing but trash ass niggas
Wanna see me later, motherfuckers bring it this way
Y'all don't want drama
You gotta be armored 'cause I'ma leave a body deep caged

[Verse 9: Rittz]
Want fantasy then hit the AMC or watch Ironman
You spider fan, I'm not from Marvel
I'm a real-life villain and I lost the marbles
That I had inside my head, it's like I'm far from normal
I'm an oddball, daddy always told me it was mom's fault
When he was choking her
Throwing her into the armoire
I recall all of her, watching Reservoir Dogs
Years later, fear may begin to be a lost cause
Hit me in the soft charge
Hitting up my lady when I seen her getting raw-dogged
By my homies and my momma went and had the cops called
On me and then it dawned on me
I was copying the shit that's all getting brought up
Drug dealers getting robbed at the car wash
Hurry, take his weed, make a bead till it's all starch
Point blank range, ain't no Lee Harvey Oswald
Snipers on the roof from the north side
Blessed life bitch

[Verse 10: Monoxide]
Well I'ma fight with the norm and
While I'm on stage performin'
And you just can't ignore it
Like the rain when it's stormin'
Hear my brains ever storin'
I bring the pain, it's imploring
You hear the lasting roar when I'm in there recording
Anybody wanna come and get mine
Better come with an army behind
When the dust falls and the smoke clears
We're like fuck y'all, you're so last year
That we've moved on to the gas steerin'
To a new lawn, a new atmosphere
Like I'm newborn and fuckin' 'em up
Fuck with a whole crew of fake-ass used for

[Verse 11: Jamie Madrox]
I am not a quitter
Run with a pack of individuals of certified hitters
And fuck what you heard
I rep with the criminal spitters and money getters
And motherfuckers call 'em day ones
Ain't no flip-flop when the day comes
To the tip-top, suckas say some
See the bitch coming through you like Jame Gumb
This ain't James Gunn and I'm favored
For the lame dumb trying to start some, man fuck them
Knowing nowhere in the galaxy
Knowing no friend and no fallacy
Fuck 'em all, all of 'em casualties
I'm on a state road with the family, that's for the family
Everyone else tried to damage me, think of 'em all
And imagine me giving a fuck with the stones of infinity

[Verse 12: Tech N9ne]
Killing everything and everybody, I don't give a fuck (jack shit)
How you gonna come and try to battle when your lyrics suck (black dick)
All I'm gonna do is eliminate when I generate
The pen had made the planet disintegrate
When I innovate I eat up everything within the beat
Until I'm really stuffed (fat bitch)
They're gonna hate this avengers ninja
Family same place as Simba kin ya
Serengeti is ready to end ya, begin the
Machete beheading the petty sinners for dinner
Do you follow me (hell yes)
If anyone try to hollow me (smell death)
You rappers that wanna hate on me (sell less)
The people that see the great in me (yell Tech)
GRRR!
