[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I got a story to tell, 'bout when I ginormously fell
Won't say no names though, 'cause it ain't no game, bro
And it ain't no angle makin' no woof tickets for me to sell
It's about two buddies in the middle of bout due
A lady on the daily puttin' out to
One of the buddies, she told him never let his mouth spew
Don't let your boy know what's happenin'
'Cause we were together, plus shackin' in
That's what you call get some back in friends
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne & Joey Cool]
I was twenty-one
She was 40-somethin', say she wanna give me some
So I started puttin' Tecca Ninna in the lungs
Of the photographer that my homie Brian B'zle brung
But it was a catch, she didn't want a nigga to rack
'Cause her and my homie were together, he'd give her the scratch
After every photo-shoot but he'd have a bitter attack
If he knew his colleague would shoot me then deliver the snatch
So I kept her secret like a dummy, keepin' it professional
I didn't tell my homie but I was full of regret, you know?
Ridin' out with my homie, out my mouth, ain't no decibels
'Bout when she finished flickin' me, we'd bang out on the sectional
I used to throw him hints sayin', "I really wanna smash her"
Then he would look at me like I was done it with laughter said
"She would never do it, I don't know what you after
Out of your league, man you young, broke and plus you a rapper"
Damn

[Hook: Darrein Safron, Joey Cool & Tech N9ne]
Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, On my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
That I was tappin' in
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
'Cause he was a best friend
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne & Joey Cool]
She would pick me up for photo sessions
But I didn't tell my homie we were low-low sexin'
Man this lady had a body like she was SoloFlex'n
So right after work, she let me give her a pogo lesson
No confession never told him, I was grindin'
On his workin' roommate, I was slimin'
But I messed up and told my other homie Big Nick
But when me and him fell out he told my best friend
That I was lyin' all this time and then my homie said
Why is you playin' me, I'm hearing too many rumors
Yo you got something to say to me, man?
You know about my affection for that woman that stay with me
You supposed to be my homie, why you fuckin' and fakin'?
And then I gotta hear from someone else
You selfish man all you think about is your fuckin' self
You and her be together, I don't need no one's help
I'm feel like I'm finna lose it, I don't know what I'ma do
But I swear to...
Hold on my nigga, you can't be callin' me trippin'
I'm with my family and I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout that's fuckin' insanity man
Why you lyin' to me bro, you know these people be talkin'
And their stories sound the same and you makin' it awkward
And I ain't finna be the type to act like this don't really hurts
What am I supposed to do 'bout it when I'm at work?
You and her, we supposed to be brothers that make it worse
And he told me everything y'all be doin', don't do me dirt
Don't deny it homie, really you oversteppin' your turf
Told me y'all was snappin' photos and you removin' her skirt
Even said I shoulda known this fuckin' chick was a flirt
Well how you gonna believe every damn thing he say?
Dog you for real? You shoulda told me without a delay
We was like fam, now you got me dealin' with hearsay
And everything that he say, she say
Oh, I gotta go

[Hook: Darrein Safron, Joey Cool & Tech N9ne]
Bros become foes yeah (bros become foes)
Lord knows the lovin' was fly though
It ain't worth livin' these lies though
On my dog (On my dog, On my dog)
Yeah
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
That I was tappin' in
I should have told him, I should have told him, I should have told him
'Cause he was a best friend
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
So that is how me and my best friend fell out
'Cause I told another homie something he had to yell out
All of our bidness ventures and dreams was the hell out
And I'm left with underhanded things that I can tell 'bout
Lost my best friend, 'cause I was young and dumb
He lost his life to another brother with a gun
I never got to tell him that I was sorry, I was sprung
My other homie just died of cancer, I'm numb
So the moral of the story is don't
Lie to get something that you really want
Always keep it real, though a lot of people don't
That's why they always in funk

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
Shoulda told him I was tappin' in
That ain't never what you do to best friends
