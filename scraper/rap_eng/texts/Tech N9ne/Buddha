Inhale it, baby

[Hook]
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high, I'm so high)
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high)

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne]
I ain't talking about no meditation, just medication

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You got your vape, you got your brownies, you got your taffy
You got that shuttle to blast me the grassy zipped tight in a baggie
Then we'll try it be the highest, man I quit now cannabis and I is reunited
Be delighted we going to see the itis if you wanna chop away the deficit legalize it
KC good with that, we hit the sack
That don't mean sleep in the phat sheets with your cat
Talking 'bout kief in the pack
Or having the heavenly hellish heap of the hashish
Then attract peace, tweaking for snacks, feast in the
Weed cheesing 'cause we in the act
With a couple of beautiful b-zies spin a rack
And I'm dancing at the krilla with the chronic leaf in the bag
If you got it, you gotta let one more soul invade your camp
It's a pot of gold and you gotta know
I'm gonna score them pesos, champ
I'm so peaceful, the haters wanna come throw doors
And they so can't
Puffing on Buddha, that's my numb your hoe
And dick your chick

[Hook]
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high, I'm so high)
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high)

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne]
I ain't talking about no meditation, just medication

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Had a party at the krilla
My brother Mackzilla got a big group of Sheilas
That're ready to heal us and about to feel us 'cause they digging for millas and admire the skrilla
But of course I'm gonna get the bowed one that got up the courage to wanna roll one
She chipping and chopping like she's a Sh≈çgun
It's twisted, it's loaded, then we blow some
I'm tripping, she tripping, I make a decision
To run to the kitchen with a cottonmouth mission
Got a hazy condition this lady's position
Was pay me for the spliff and then maybe submission
Too high to try and turn crazy on
The way she came off it was shady, wrong
I got many people that gave me zongs
Told that Bianca "away, begone"
Leave us, we keep bud and nobody gotta see her
Coming cheaper than a Totino's pizza
That sound good when I'm puffing on the reefer
After working, I be choking in my leisure
Something about it make the Nina wanna please a, diva
Looking for something to come and ease ya
You can bet on the killer cannabis sativa

Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high, I'm so high)
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high)

[Bridge 2]
Pass it among us, dab-dab if you wanna blast
Pass it among us, dab if you wanna
Pass-pass it among us, dab-dab like you really should
Yeah you know my Buddha stash keep me feeling good

[Hook]
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high, I'm so high)
Bud-dha
I'm so high (so high)
