[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yo, it started right here, and it's gon' end right here
Black warriors on a quest to take back what's ours
The title! And we comin' to get it, baby!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] x3
Get your shoes on!
Get Ready!
Get your shoes on!
Come On!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Lights, camera, action, that just happened to ya
Defeat we ridin' the glory ride like hallelujah
Soon as we touch down
The spirit of Jim Brown
Get the hand off in a standoff, I'm running through ya
Get in way of fittin' Jim Crow got us sittin'
In the nosebleeds, what you gettin'
Knock of the winnin'
Philosophy been velocity for the brother man
The story ends with catastrophe for the other man
If you against me you ball
Your weather fence bein' small
Talk just offends me, we all
Come from the motherland
But if you tempt me to fall
I'm OJ Simpson'in' y'all
Meaning I'm taking a ball
Straight through the Middlelands
Get the pedal and throttle, I strive to remember the Titan
Not a thing, achievin' my dreams, pushin' and fightin'
So when that marchin' band marchin' to that new song
Shut up your cleats, vibe to the beat and put your shoes on

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] x4
Get your shoes on!
Get Ready!
Get your shoes on!
Come On!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Yo, extraterrestrial, I come from the air up there
I'm strong and black, the way I act way I'm wearing my hair
I'm from the new school, tatted up and draped out
Before the clocks over, you crossed over and flaked out
They sayin' he got game us, he must be lovin' basketball
Well maybe it's the spirit of Jesse Owens, I'm passin' y'all
Shakin', bacon, fakin', you players out?
What can you say about?
Black athletes'll never be playin' out
See I'm at peace with the Rock
Your feet gonna stop
When I unleash just a piece
The Caesar is stopped
Blocked by my blockas
Running-back to get my back up
Huntin' for your quarterback inside of slackin' slacks up
The worst on the Earth, and I'm all up on your turf and
Screamin' "Touchdown", whole team get to skurfin'
Two steps ahead of ya
Let em go cause he gone
Shift your whole team, that boy mean with his shoes on

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko] x4
Get your shoes on!
Get Ready!
Get your shoes on!
Come On!
