[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Tecca Nina's drunk as hell at three in the morning
When you're snoring I just hit the afterspot without a (warning)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Pop it off, top it off, if you're trippin' knock it off
Stop it, no squabs in this spot just Biancs and it's hot as Molotovs
Girl let's get that bobbin' off, I don't wanna hear that it's gotta cost
How does it feel for you to be with the real
On my heels dead smack right-side a boss
I'm mixin' my liquors, belligerent strippers
Spill different mixer on my vivorant kickers
No more wishin' to grip her, she's unzippin' my zipper
Not itchin' to kiss her, but I'm fixin' to twist her
When they flaunt it, I move on it, daggonnit now who want it?
Drink a lot of 151, I'ma get it done
It's really fun when I be killin' my opponent

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
Don't be so damn cool, act a fool
Let's go cuckoo, jump, get loose
When in the party everybody move (move)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move

Hey, oh, hey (move) hey, everybody move it
If you ain't come to party, tell me what you doin'
We come to kick it, you should be kickin' it too it
Do it, do it, everybody move it

[Bridge]
Don't be so damn cool, act a fool
Let's go cuckoo, jump, get loose
When in the party everybody move (move)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Check it out I'm fearless
N9ne's a sniper, never bit off a rapper
If I'm near death
I'm a fighter, but I spit off the clapper
And I like weird sex
I'm the piper, women trip off the whacker
Lookin' for the beer fest
Time to scheiße or get off the crapper
Man I move on a lady give her what she deserve
Try to win 'er dinner
Whole lotta bump in the night, man a lot to be heard
I'ma bend 'er, spin 'er
Drunk enough to lie to the Bianc sayin' that I'll be hers
Then I'm in her center
Then I giddy up, suck it up baby, I'm a free bird
Like Lynyrd Skynyrd
All around the globe (yeah) gotta get the dough (yeah)
When I do it moving, I'm lookin' out for the hoes
Alaska, Auckland, Denmark shows (yeah)
Gotta have a chick on the road because everybody knows
I'm a naughty-naughty-naughty boy-boy-boy
When I'm in Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy! Oy! Oy!
Muevete

Everybody move, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move

Hey, oh, hey (move) hey, everybody move it
If you ain't come to party, tell me what you doin'
We come to kick it, you should be kickin' it too it
Do it, do it, everybody move it

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
It's poda be over, but I know the premoter
So he pour the reloader, 'cause I'm sotally tober
Now I close in on his bim-bo, 'cause he froze when he chose her
Swept his ho right off them ten toes 'cause he old and he ogre
Get a move on, get right up in it, 'cause it'll never get better
When ya sittin' by the minute, consider movin’ the mountain
Never stopping, never limits, I'm 'til the finish
And when it's competition I'm diminishin' it
Everybody move to this, get drunk hella booze to this
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo time for you to choose a chick
Take her home, beat it up like a pugilist
I flow like I'm wah wah, galla galla ya da da
Him who holla him better than muah ha him full of shi-kaka

[Bridge]
Don't be so damn cool, act a fool
Let's go cuckoo, jump, get loose
When in the party everybody move (move)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Don't be cool, everybody move
Everybody move, everybody move

Hey, oh, hey (move) hey, everybody move it
If you ain't come to party, tell me what you doin'
We come to kick it, you should be kickin' it too it
Do it, do it, everybody move it

[Outro]
I was in the hotel room in my bed with this one chick
When another finer chick walked in
So I told the chick right next to me to MOVE
