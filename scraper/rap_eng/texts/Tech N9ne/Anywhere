[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
Anywhere but here
I'd rather rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Question: Anybody ever feel
That some people around you claim to be solid but ain't real?
In relationships, business, family, in the end it's about they bills
And everyone of them wanna cheat and steal
Time for me to have no chill
Come and get ya meals and they really will with zeal
All is needy, y'all is greedy, I'm falling freely
This gonna be scogging me, we brawling easy, had a lawman seize me
Get the hell on stay, what ya gonna do but if it's a fail on pay
Loved ones exude hella rude when it used to be smooth
Like the face of Janelle Mon√°e
She's got the glee stopped
I'm in a pit of animals really making me bleed lots
Fatigue I wanna leave then my knee dropped
When I breathe not 'cause she needs guap
So extract me from this place full of hate that attacks me
Pass the sack 'cause I'm trying to get to happy
Exactly people are feeding  they call me nasty at me

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

[Verse 2]
Listen
They don't love you no more
They discover your flow
But I'm feeling my fans trying to shudder don't slow
Leaving the clown now I'm nothing but a bozo to 'em
Give my all in my sessions
I never thought that I would fall in regression
The music business now we call it recession
We bawl and we stressing 'cause y'all is divesting
I feel it when I ought to be top of these
Where the hip hopper be and The Rock put me
At the forefront but galore won, nothing but the Pac could be hypocrisy
They forgot about the prophecy that I keep the lock and key
But they talking "He soft" and flee now they wanna coffin me
Y'all can be treacherous, I'm the best at this effortless
But with Tech it's been deficits
Wanna fly away like a Pegasus
I feel like the scare is near, they don't care that Tech share his tears
At this moment, at this point in time I'd rather be anywhere but here

[Hook]
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

[Hook]
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere anywhere
Anywhere but here

[Bridge]
Sometimes I just wanna fly away
Sometimes I just wanna leave the sky

[Verse 3]
I'm sure to be
At this rate, a nigga that fades into obscurity
I can't take bein' treated like an amateur
This is impure to me
In closing, it's messed up when you know you one of the chosen
But you can't have a show when nobody rose and all the people go when everything's frozen

[Outro]
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly
Far far, far away from here
Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly
Far far, far away from here
