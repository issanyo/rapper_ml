[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha drank
My pocket is full of bank
You want me to stop I can't
It's sho hot in this place I think that I'm bout to faint
So baby..

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha
Poh me anutha drank (Do It) [x2]

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I wanna couple of dem para-dises
Gimme two of dem sum a dem beetches
That's the Hennessy at the top
That's fifty dollars a shot
Too much will make you pop to pieces
Cause when I party yes I drink to sin
Gimme drunk enough I'll probably bink a friend
Rumble in my belly
Head is in the toilet
I will never ever get drunk again
I'm talkin bout them other cats
Drinkin a little boo and then they had enough of that
Dark is what I do can never get enough yak
But what I do while they mixin' em
What I gotta ask
Sane lookin man gon make me three
Cups of delicious K.C. Tea
That's Hennesy, Sprite and lemon
If you got better than that you gotta make me see
Off in the club fucked up
And I got all of my bucks up
Twenty women at the bar right next to me
Every one of them just lucked up
Saturday night Voodoo Loungin' it
'Cause P & L club's got boo boo sounds in it
All twenty comin' with the crew who's down to hit
Til the break of dawn wit a new new poundin' it
Last call
Ain't no such
Then we drinkin' one in my clutch
Keep the party goin'
I'm getting your lust up
Everybody we be comin' to lift your cups then

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm theatre of the hood
When it's lights, cameras, faction
Niggas gon be niggas when it's fight satisfaction
I walk up to the bar smellin' like the Kenneth Reaction
Niggas reactin' like you must be out of his slacks
When I'm undressed I confess I act a foolery
A pocket full of ducqets
Buku bitches and jewelery
I'm buyin' out the bar like my name was Anheusur Brewery
And hittin' bush by the deuce
Like Jesus created two of me
Haters they make me famous
So I'm deservin' an Oscar
Walkin' by niggas notice my swagger's disturbin' they posture
But I don't ever plex, the index got a steady aim
Cause the K will make them feel more hits than Teddy Pain
So I don't have to tease about the way I'm makin' cheese
I know you haties wanna cease and desist
But it will never ever happen
Cause I'm definitely rapping
At the party wondering when will I quit
I simply say

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 1 Ton]
I'm the type of drinker with no mixers in my liquors
Crown Royal on the rocks serve it in your biggest pitcher
I be cocktail pimpin' Potluck too high to talk to women
Just wanna get em drunk shut em up and get up in em
She tipsy off six shots
She's feelin' my Rick Ross
She wanna lick a rapper and roll wit a big boss
Push it to the limit
Everyday's another party
Pineapple mali and Bacardi turnin' all the women naughty
Uh-Oh

[Verse 4: Underrated]
I be drinkin' everyday like I'm on tour
And I love to get high like bonjour
Take another shot the shit's contagious
Like Nicolas Cage you live in Las Vegas
I'm sedated and spaded
Aimlessly lookin' for faded hoes who wanna get naked
'Cause bitch it's under rated
So pour me another drink
I want one
I'mma take it to the head til they all done
I can barely stand up let alone run
But the name of the game is to have fun
So take a shot with me little mama
I promise I don't bite like Jeffery Dahmer
I'm goin' to the top like Barack Obama
I'm a never slow it down like a comma
So I'ma..

[Hook]
