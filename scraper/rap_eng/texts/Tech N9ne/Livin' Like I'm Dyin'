[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Living like I'm dying tomorrow, ain't no time for no sorrow
Throw on my platinum Movada, Robert Graham on my collar
Spray Luciana Soprana, holla at a mama who's na-nas
Lava hot like carne asada, scholar with a bra like Toccara
Balla, I got a few dollars, hamduallah my father taught us to
Follow Qu'ran and not Osama Bin Lada, my mama was
Not a part of Islam but God is her water
So why does the, sickness got her like a Llama just shot her
Goosfraba, woosah, I gotta get outta this rah-rah
And fly to Hono-lulu, inside a grotto
'Bou Lou and five la matas
No yada-yada, they ride on this rod and bob you then swallow
Sun got us all the color of Shabba
Then I pop the bottle of Moscato
Ride away on my Yamaha
Vamonos, I promise I'm, never the one to be monitored
By the blue collar copper, we call him Erik Estrada
Got a wad in my Levi's and a nigga never got to borrow!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm living like I'm dying tomorrow
So I gotta do a lot of living today
I think I'm gon' drown in a bottle
And party like I think about to go in a day
I'm seeing lots of pretty women so you know I'm going in
They gon' blow this whole world up so I'mma party until then

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Man, I has partied harder than Diddy in Gucci, Louie with Henny
Like I'm dying when I'm gone won't be taking none of it with me
As sure as my name is Nutty Kutty Cal, you can picture me
Partying like it's going out of style, I-I
Feel I'm the best who done did it, most underrated and hated
But if I die then so be it, then in my head I'm the greatest
It ain't a bitch I ain't christened, city or state I ain't mentioned in
If I die then my eulogy will be held at the Kemperman
I done smoked, I done drinked and then popped my pills to extremities
(Still do it!) Every now and then I pop more than Yosemite
Keep my foes and my enemies and the ones that pretend to be (Close to me)
Cause honestly them the ones that'll hinder me
So henceforth remember me, this voice is finna be
His choice of energy, by him I mean all men
Party like it's 1999, smoke my wood tip wine
Giving all my things to God then say "Amen"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ubiquitous]
'Till summer's here and if the winter comes, to great days turn to yellow ones
I stay grinding for mine, I tried to tell 'em once
To travel to the moon you gotta face the elements
And battle any goon you gotta cage the elephants
It's elementary, I speak with a certain eloquence
I smoke hella blunts, a habit I been developed since
I was a young boy playing the silver ball
See 'em stand, feel 'em fall, Metallica, kill 'em all
Huh, living like this is my last moment
But a moment could last forever
Snap a picture and Nat Cole it
Get whatever you gon' sip in your glass, hold it up
Hit the side on mine, get to tipping it back, throw in
So many days we was sitting low, better get busy living 'till the day
You giving in and get to go where the sinners go
Pulling the cash and spend it slow
Gotta make it fast, but them should know
Matter no money yo, it's all expendable
Ubi out

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Godemis]
Hold your breath, count to three I'mma kill it
Killer commitee, city chairman
Strapped with a gramma Glock and the trigger, bitch, a hair pin
Three round burst, I'm aiming at your brain
Spin it, when I cock it I kiss it and call it Sara Jay
Living like I'm going down tomorrow, sit down and drown in a bottle
Go out and get another bottle
I don't lead I don't follow, If I don't eat I get hollow
I don't even play lotto, see chief I need every dollar
Y'all don't see me with a model or rockin' a lot of Prada
I don't smoke like I wanna, I'm stretching this marijuana
Fuck it I call it karma if I wake up in Nirvana
Blood is thicker than water, the mud is even more shallow
Shit, I live in the moment and pardon every opponent who pass
But I put the pedal to the metal, I got both feet on the gas
This could be the last verse that I'm writing, like it or not
Everybody's taking a rob and they put you right in a box

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
Wohoo! That's Ces Cru! Ubiquitous and Godemis!
Y'all ain't fucking with that, boy!

[Hook]
