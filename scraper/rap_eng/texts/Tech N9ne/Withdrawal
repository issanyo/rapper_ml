[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Now in the distant future
I won't be, dependent on you
Your pleasure is my torture
So I let you do what you do

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
The love you give to me
The reason I lost it all
I'm flying without wings
I'm free, I'm free to fall
So withdrawal

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Take me to a place
Where I can't feel my face
And I'm half the man I think I'm s'posed to be
(Withdrawal)
Cause I hate living here
Well, I gotta face my fears
But I can't let this drug take over me
(Withdrawal)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I wanna go back up there
But that's the, way I'll die
And sober seems so unfair
And not the way to be high

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Hello, can you hear me now?
I need you here to do music and write your raps when
Something really frightful happens
Making my life so taxing
You overdose it'll kill me like a rifle clapping
At me if I go jack can
No longer hear my bro laughing
Living items bad when
Every night so saddened
Gotta fight yo ass
Or deep down inside no action
Call it your bible black friend
My pyro blasting cause don't you know
That's how we lost Michael Jackson

[Hook]
