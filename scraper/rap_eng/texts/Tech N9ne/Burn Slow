[Verse 1: Dirty J]
First time we met, I was tripping balls
Jeffery shit when I touch these walls
Crawl in a cave when the daytime calls
Hibernate, animals
Next night out when I'm feeling great
Met this chick in an altered state
Heels as big empire state
She's a model, fuck that's great
Gave me a touch
Said, "what's up?"
I said, "fucking, nothing much"
Ask me what I'm wearing
I said, "shhh, designer drugs"
Lucy and the diamonds
Turn off, the lights are blinding
I'll spit this last line
And you can call me Scott Weiland
Burn slow

[Hook: Dirty J]
I can see ya through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside ya
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow
I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that you're always on go
I can feel that your mind's always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
Hold it in, ghost toke
When our lips touch we both smoke
If the feeling is right, we both know
If the hit's too big, we both choke
Man I love this feeling
Got my head above the ceiling
Burn it slow 'cause we just chilling
Got no where to go but here
And I just love the way that you vibe
I'm on your level and I
I care not what they say, I'm 'onna do whatever feels right
So I lose it, no control
Light me up and just watch me go
Don't confuse it, I get stupid
I get stoned, yeah I go ruthless
Burn it slow

[Hook: Dirty J]
I can see ya through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside ya
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow
I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that you're always on go
I can feel that your mind's always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

[Refrain: Dirty J]
I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow
I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Sit at home when I'm killin' the pages
I do it because I love it, got incredible wages
I wanna kick it like a horny devil in Vegas
I call up a couple ladies with the medical haze
Both are super sick and ready to roll
Got the grinder out and shredded the dough
Now it's time to get kinetic, we headed
For vertical travel, yo, like never before
Me and the women are puffin' in the garage
What am I thinkin', I think I want a MÃ©nage
Lovin' the feelin', I gotta inner massage
I gotta sit it, I'm thinkin' I'm havin' dinner with God
Super silver haze, taking me up
Super killer babes, shaking thee butts
All the beauty steady making me puff
And I said to both of 'em 'Jamaican me lust'
That's what I yearn for
So thick, so beautiful when we cipher
I'm not thinkin' about no germs so my turn yo
What about some lovin', I'm concerned though
We learn dough
Really make you make my worm grow
Adjourned
Then after we burn slow

[Hook: Dirty J]
I can see ya through the flames of your lighter
I can see you with the lights down low
I can feel it when I'm standing beside ya
Got the feeling that you want to burn slow
I can see that you're always on the move
And I can see that you're always on go
I can feel that your mind's always running
Got the feeling that you wanna burn
Wanna burn slow

[Refrain: Dirty J]
I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow
I take my time cause I know that you wanna burn slow

[Outro: Duddy B + Dirty J]
Hold it in, ghost toke, ghost toke, ghost toke
I can see ya through the flames of your lighter
Hold it in, ghost toke, ghost toke, ghost toke
