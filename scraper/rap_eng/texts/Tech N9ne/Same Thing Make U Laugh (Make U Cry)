[Verse 1: Who Wride]

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Same thing to make you laugh
Same thing to make you cry
My oh my you do dirt and now you die (Now you die)
No need to worry why
It's an eye for an eye
Same thing to make a nigga laugh, make a nigga cry

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Havin' em' all on earth, I'm going up in multiple skirts
And I'm gonna bond my god
So I got a ring on but still gotta get my fling on
Laughter is indeed the best medi-cine
When you run through bitches with the speed of light
Just like time Edison
Laughing at bitches cause they give it up to me so easy they think they really gon' see me on MTV so they give it up freely
Till one fine night, my loving wife, found out then took me away by sticking me over and over again with a butcher knife
Now I lay me 6 feet down I found the penalty for adultry
Living eternal life sultry, g-o-d showed me, para-d-i-s-e then he opened the depths of hell for me now I suffer for infinity
Placement was, my genital area streched for miles only for hideous scorpions and snakes to catch
Why are my penis to pieces?
Now I regret I ever cheated, used to [?] dick and beating now it's being deleted
Used to laugh, now when I'm puddle of blood and puss I gasp
Used to chase ass, now the serpents bites they everlast
Now I like what pain that will never ever die
Same thing to make a nigga laugh, make a nigga cry
