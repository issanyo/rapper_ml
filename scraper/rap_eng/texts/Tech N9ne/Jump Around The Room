[Hook x4]
You know what we do
Jumping all around the room

Jumping all around the room

[Verse 1: Young Lucci]
Bass beat, bass beat
Through your chest can hear me now
If my brother's girl can see me now
He'll properly say you so buck wild
It's the cut hey it's the jam
Track sound like Timbaland
Wow better start jumpin man
This pill just started kicking in
All about dollar yeah
All about a fed what
All about freaks yeah
All about a fast forward
We just in the spot can't stand up
Gotta be a hater if them damn hands ain't up
Myl plus a mill
Equals money
Off the tizzy
Girls get dizzy
You're so loco wit it easy
When I tear them broads greezy
Better hit em up dawg belive me
They're gonna get robbed please me
Just take you're shirt off
Jump in and jump out
Know just what I'm talking bout
We move the room and
Why did shawty gotta hump out
I can't explain that boom bouncin dance floor wildin within a group
Use to hop in my ho and make a porno movie
They won't do it for elane but they goin sure do it for Lucci
Never mind how we out here just
Stand up and salute me jump!

[Hook x4]
You know what we do do
Jumping all around the room
Matic what we do do

[Verse 2: Matic Lee]
Get silly
Really wanna try that
Lost my mind
Really wanna find that
Goin bananas
Pay no mind to that like diddy tell the bitch uhuh
Kinda hot might need to fan that
Get a little musty might need to ban that
Leave my space I mean that to the men I'm seeing space ships might wanna land that
Gettin absurd trying to hurt with words
And I'mma bout bullet you right into the curb
Ain't catching a bit of feelings but you're gettin on my nerves
Get beamed up like Captain Kurt
Ain't neva been a fella that'll pop off first
But I end it with a finish cause it's always worst
Don't wanna do it cool cause you're feelin on my turf
And you can get sereved like you're ?? scared
They sayin I'm insane
Jumpin all around like house of pain
Ellah ellah ellah hey
Look that way I'll make it rain
My money stayin in my jeans
Subdided little bitches wanna say I'm lame
What I look like throwin what I got paid
Silly ho go jump from a train
Ladies and gentlemen
Lookin for a bitch that smells like cinnamon
My wallet, you ain't gettin in
Stay at the beginning cause you ain't even gettin in
No pants go cause there ain't no dividends
So spazzy got me some Ritalin
Thank you Susie, I'm drillin them
OJ, white girls I'm killin them

[Hook x4]
You know what we do
Jumping all around the room
Nina what we do
Jumping all around the room

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Slow your roll, if you're not sick
Hold your flow, this is toxic
Rampin' it up, pick it up, lift it up
Got the choppin' the poppin'
Never givin' nobody nothin' but thuggin' and bussin'
I'm 'bout to give 'em another one everybody gotta love 'em
Hot as an oven, I'm at the club and
Bitches they want me cuz I am McLovin
Pumpin' and shovin' my drug in the glove
When I get on the mic, man they come by the dozen
I don't really know, when I'm ever gon stop
Panties on the floor, Tecca Nina gon knock
Get up in the middle break em off a little
Celebate is never what I fiddle when I'm all up in the box
I be jumping arounda da rooma
Libaka aba they laba da zuba
Baby you craby to obba for mebe to bebe you lova no babies for youba
Everybody just jump around the room
Everybody get crunk around the goon
We don't ever get bunk, in the middle of funk
I don't really wanna dump the clown balloon
Tech N9ne is sick and vicious
I'mma leave yo chick in stitches
Run up in her bras when I'm in yo house right when she rinsing dishes
So you better not introduce me
She'll be doin the oochie coochie
Jumping around the room, creeping around the groom
With Tech N9ne, Matic Lee and Lucci
