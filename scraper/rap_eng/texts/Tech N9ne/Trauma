[Verse 1: Hannible Bear Lector]
Welcome to the land of misery
Where my delivery strikes with madness
Hearts explode from the touch of the .44 blastin' (Party)
By the killers from the Midwest
You can scream all you want but there's no help
As I see your destiny ends in the hands of me
Black talons ripping through your body
The sight of a blood scene, murder is what I fiend
For so at the darkest hour, the clock ticks twelve
You feel the wrath of my power

[Verse 2: Rock Money]
What you gonna do when all these niggas collide?
I got so many mentalities I'll show you outside (Deadly)
Clever killing is my forte
Cutting off victim's nipples, a murderous foreplay
Can't even fuck with mine
I'm crazier than Dahmer, Charlie Manson combined (One of a kind)
Diabolic, symbolic, face the infernal
Evil demon and I can make you eternal

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Trauma
Brain bombah
Inflictin' pain on a
Nigga with homa-
Cidal shit me whole persona
Nervous
Lyrics at yo, service
You heard of this
Murderous
Demons they comma
When shooting like the chrome llama
Trauma
Brain bombah
Inflictin' pain on a
Nigga with homa-
Cidal shit me whole persona
Nervous
Lyrics at yo, service
You heard of this
Murderous
Demons they comm

[Verse 3: Rock Money]
An introduction to my murderous plot
I got so many wicked ways
And they start on yo block
(One) Label you my bitch
(Two) I let you know
(Three) Execution
Drag you out yo door, nobody to witness
I call it habit, you call it a verbal sickness
Damaging with a quickness
Describe the feeling while I rip you apart
I get evil when the day but even worse after dark

[Verse 4: Hannible Bear Lector]
Murda (Murda)
Killin', it just don't stop (Homicidal)
The 12 gauge left you up and down
But another victim called the D-E-A-D
Listen to that underground massacre terror
Seize the streets, feel my heat (Whoo!)
The N9ne Amerikilla got me goin' like Donald Goines
The cannabis got me deep like the abyss
So I sit back relax, warm it up like Kris
A bruised the fist of fury when stepping me
I 8-1-6 that mothafucking ass in Missouri
Or should I say the land of misery
Where life's fucked up
Disguise like yo shadow when I buck ya (Blah Blah!)

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Trauma
Brain bombah
Inflictin' pain on a
Nigga with homa-
Cidal shit me whole persona
Nervous

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
Amuart, amuart
Trauma, trauma
You's a gonner, gonner
Tecca Nina like vaginas, I bring drama
Make niggas swing on a
Ding-a-ling I'm gonna flunda
Irritable, formidable
Right now, hit em in the middle of Rogue Dog, straight showed y'all
That I'll be game, anyone wanna know what's the deal
The simple fact is that I'll flip ya, flip ya for real, I'm at ya
But when I get rhymer block, I need some ginacock
Right after that fact I'm like a bull in a China shop
Six pluses believe it I'll be the bomb one day
If my shit was dropping in a week, today is Palm Sunday
One way ticket to necrosis
Focus on music like Mr. Holland's Opus
Notice (I'm) Still kicking hocus pocus
Witchcraft, whiplash, kick ass
Rhyme flows, sign up the timed shows
So I'm not behind hoes
Divine souls, plotting to kill all the demons
Any color many killings plenty separable pillins
These rappers now (I'll swallow yo soul, swallow yo soul)
This underground (I gotta explode, gotta be cold)
Nina's bold, they couldn't kill me if they sent Dahmer (why?)
Demons they comma when shooting like the chrome llama

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Trauma
Brain bombah
Inflictin' pain on a
Nigga with homa-
Cidal shit me whole persona
