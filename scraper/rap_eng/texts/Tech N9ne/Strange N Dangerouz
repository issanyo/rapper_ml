[Verse 1: Mr. Liqz]
I’m a mastadon
Untouchable when im grippin the microphone
Rare like a bullet to the back of the dome
Got a look in my eye that’ll make you nervous kinda like a light on and nobody home
Get em when i kill em with the venom in yo veins
Holdin me down but ima break your chains
Lightnin strike comin at yuh
Quicker than a rattler
Fuckin you while i be strokin the brain (Strange)
Im far from famous everybody knows im dangerous
Shameless
Kiss my anus
You dont wanna play this game im sick and i play faces
Come face this
Put you in your places
You ain’t even really ready for alien races
Break your legs you need ankle braces
Murder the judge and get ready to call cases
(right)
Ima beat these soldiers left march right dont say i never told yuh
(so)
Calm myself then my heart gets slow
Then i
Take it to a whole nother level where the devil doesnt even wanna go
Then i
(stroke)
Till my beat gets hot and i find anothr planet to wrestle on
(i get sick)
Eat your thoughts
Spit em in the verse when it starts to rock
Blood dont clot
You won't bleed the same color as the next man up the block
Ima eat em when i get em and i hit em with the venom of the teeth
Dont touch when i crush the bong
Y'all wanna come try test us
He’ll be the first to find out you were naked at home

[Hook: Mr. Liqz]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Looking at me you be thinking I be on some
Voodoo shit, noodles, it's coocoo, but you do the math
I'm a motherfucking original villian that'll
Shoot you, be doodoo, but through you, my 2 Rug'll blast
Giving you damages anthrax in your cannabis
I'm the candidate if you tripping out I'mma vanish it
Manic and management in my land I'mma handle it
We blaming dammit and never jam it at my evangelist
Tech N9ne's complex mind they can't explain this
Next time he flex rhymes just check his insane shit
Totally sick is my recipe, I be sharp and shameless
Serving niggas to the death of me, reason my art's been famous
Looking at everybody staring at me 'cause I'm a rebel
Living it bigger than a motherfucker packing the metal
Jack it or back it up you gotta be hot as a kettle
If he wanna fuck around and I'm gonna be pushing the pedal
I can off with the Moss when I off ya
Niggas'll be singing and sniffing up in the altar
In the coffin lost when the boss come and caught ya
Never cross the moth when I stalk ya to toss ya
Banging's heinous, when I'm aiming flames is bringing thangs to tame his slang and lame shit
Rearrange and change his vein and brains and angle it til he's slain and famous
Tech N9ne
Strange and dangerous!
