[Intro]
Turn me up a little bit Ben
So I'm just 'bout to spit some shit real quick
It's the last song
'Cause I ain't got to the Promiseland, baby
Let's go!

[Verse 1]
I remember when my soul, hoes and dough was missin'
When I went to all the shows, yo my bros are bitchin'
Never meant to blow my goal so it's motor spittin'
And when I enter all of my flows I'm so in pole position
I promised to be the best to mom
Get us through, get up at the dawn
Let Tech spew, flip it like an omelette
Ever since the calm bet you Tech ain't made you yawn yet
I sign checks in my pocket are the color upon Shrek
The industry never passed the baton guess I grabbed it
If it's beyond us even so I get the gauntlet
This music shit was enough to make me vomit
But I kept you all astonished, make way for the KC comet
Now I'm winnin', I'm more sarcastic than Vince Vaughn yeah
Honestly when I walk in I come off like bomb threats
'Cause them no want Tech to go straight 'nam vet
Throw on jets and get all the way to this land that was promised

[Hook: Nikkiya]
Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land
To this promised land

[Verse 2]
Would you let me kiss 'em?
Couldn't defeat me none
We started beastin' 'em
Sellin' records, millin' seconds
Look at us teachin' 'em, yellin' Tech is hell and methods
Rippin' and reachin' 'em, felon jeffers tellin' heffers
I ain't got no income but I got dough and then some
In come some friends, they wanna attend hundreds send 'em
Knockin' 'em out, my chain go side to side just like a pendulum
I'm in to one but the other is impatient waitin' for the sin to come
This is what goes on now that I'm in their light
Now they know that I get my flows on they comin' out in their tights
Been chasin this for so long, never has been fair fights
Lookin' for them rare sights, it's in there right?
In the land where everything is yours
Not fictitious like the boars, all delicious like a s'more
I'm be walking through the doors they often to the stores
Got me bossin', doin' more for the Promiseland I'm you and yours, Nina

[Hook: Nikkiya]
Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land (Promiseland)
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)

[Verse 3]
Is this it? Is this what it's all about man?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking, snorting? Come on man
Meeting, feeling, touching, we on dames
Killing, busting, really loving us 'cause we all strange
Ha ha ha ha ha I like it
The Promiseland is real simply because I write it
Don't stare too long and envy 'cause you might get iritis
Now to get me for shows and lyrics it's high prices
In Promiseland I'm gonna stand an honest man
This honor gets the drama yes the llama can
Bring disaster on rappers like water on Japan
He got his chance and Tech puts it all on his fans

[Hook: Nikkiya]
Look at me, what you see? Livin' life in luxury
Rolling down this road doing this thing
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
This is the Promiseland (this is the Promiseland)
What you people fail to see was me walking through desert heat
Through storm and rains with demons chasing me
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)
To this promised land (this is the Promiseland)

[Outro]
Strange Music, baby
It's what we been waitin' on
For everybody to recognize the real shit
It's all happening, baby
We just gon' ride out to this, I love this beat
Yeah, we in the Promiseland, baby
