[Intro: Tech N9ne]
You know, I'm quite fed up with you rap chumps
Talking smack and running your mouth all over our music
You stop that shit
You STOP THAT SHIT

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Get 'em up off me
Got something to back 'em up off me
Kali Baby killing 'em softly
20-city tour, so away we go
I'm gettin (Whoo) from a bitch that I barely know
A basket case
The nigga with the strangest face
That you remember from a dangerous place
Well, niggas still come through so heavy
415's in a old school Chevy (Kansas City)
She watching me soon as I stepped in
So watch ya girl cuz she be jeffin'
She looking hungry, I'mma feed her again
She let me hit it, I'mma beat it again
Cause she know that I be in

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sum'n brand new in the ride
You know I got my thang on my side (What's sizzlin')
Your girly in my ear at the club
Baby girl tell me who me gon (Wahoo)
Girls love girls they love me (Love me)
They all know just who I be (I be)
We got that bump in that trunk
And go rump-a-bump-a-bump-bump
What's sizzlin'?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What's sizzlin'
I'm thizzlin'
Tecca Nina known to keep the panties drizzlin'
We keep it Keebler up in Kansas City Mizzland
Pill fill like I'm stranded on a izzland
With pies, thighs are, Nina's appetizers
Dress make the Tecca say
Ach du liebe schei√üe
Drop shots kill 'em the Leaning Tower of Pi-za
Pisa
Bizzies get busy with Tecca Nina
Tech N9ne fan, I am the Technician
Yonkers steady staring me down with sexpicion
Tech and Kali blowing ya scrupple with the best listening
Take a shit on 'em while the industry's just pissing
Stick it up near in the punani, just glistening
Keep it throbbing, that kitty wobbling, plus whistling
Bout to be outtie mauie wowwy, cuz this been
Brought to you by Tech Nin and Kali
What's sizzlin'?

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sum'n brand new in the ride
You know I got my thang on my side (What's sizzlin')
Your girly in my ear at the club
Baby girl tell me who me gon (Wahoo)
Girls love girls they love me (Love me)
They all know just who I be (Who I be)
We got that bump in that trunk
And go rump-a-bump-a-bump-bump
What's sizzlin'?

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Here we-ere go down the block
With the stere-reo with the top
And the deuce 6's on the dump
Bumping the new Krizz Kaliko slump

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Girls get naked
Strip club girls get naked
Squatted, watch how she take it
151 rum, I top it off and
After just one all of they tops come off
Where the big-big tippers at?
Big, thick strippers at?
Drop aboutta stack and the back and now baby gimme that
An eyefull, that is what I pull
Look what I got on my arm, I ain't talking bout the charm
Kali Baby is no impostor
Gotsta get lots a mozza
What's with it what I want then I go get it
Sick with it, admit it, no kidding
Bigger whips so me and Big Nick can fit in it, now we ripping it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Sum'n brand new in the ride
You know I got my thang on my side (What's sizzlin')
Your girly in my ear at the club
Baby girl tell me who me gon (Wahoo)
Girls love girls they love me (Love me)
They all know just who I be (Who I be)
We got that bump in that trunk
And go rump-a-bump-a-bump-bump
What's sizzlin'?

[Outro]
Kali Baby
We are your future
You are the past
