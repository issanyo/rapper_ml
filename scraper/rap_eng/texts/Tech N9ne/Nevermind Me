[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah, well if you feel like I feel (Turn up)
Yeah, well if you feel like I feel (Clap it up)
Yeah, well if you feel like I feel (Stand up)
Yeah (I think that's lit enough)

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I-I-I woke up this morning, new attitude
Stirring up the pot, that's what I'ma do
De-de-devil with me we contagious
City after city, almost famous (yeah, yeah)
I be, I be, I be, I be on that octane
Propane running through these dark veins
Co-co-cock when I drop, yeah I got this
Club packed, revvin' up the mosh pit
I'm a fine tune, let me remind you, I got a line through
I got something that the people wanna vibe to
Here to show you what just my kind do
I done emptied out and reloaded
Weekends be cloudy, turnt and everyone know it
Everybody peep the rage if you 'bout it
Hit 'em up!

[Pre-hook: Krizz Kaliko & Mackenzie Nicole]
Party like it's Night and Day
Living crazy is the only way
Get you where I got you when I'm on it
Bop it, lock it like you really want it
Oh, Hey!

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I don't wanna ever have to pay bills again
Time for me to work, I think I'll call in
Everyday's a weekend so let's go
Don't know what I'm thinking of
I'm just lit, nevermind me

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Okay, kay, kay
My OG partners there's some Dominoes
Couple of beers, haters coming near I tell 'em vamanos
I want those, look like they got the ball, lit, I'm on those
Two right over there look like Becky without the good hair
Hold up, hold up, got two tickets to the gun show
Ain't nobody tripping, everybody's having fun so
It's like, it's like, it's like I'm at a office Christmas party
I done kissed a couple of people, I don't even know nobody
I'm just spilling my drink, threw up in the sink
And trying to get in her pink but what do ya think
They won't let me up in my face while my breath in they stink
But it's Friday, I ain't got no job, ain't got nothing to do
Take me to a place where I can't feel my face
Turn up

[Pre-hook: Krizz Kaliko & Mackenzie Nicole]
Party like it's Night and Day
Living crazy is the only way
Get you where I got you when I'm on it
Bop it, lock it like you really want it
Oh, Hey!

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I don't wanna ever have to pay bills again
Time for me to work, I think I'll call in
Everyday's a weekend so let's go
Don't know what I'm thinking of
I'm just lit, nevermind me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Bon-jon, every lady want Don-don
We don't want no cheer bitches
So you can leave yo pom-poms
With the Necronomicon
Dressed up like I'm going to Comic-Con
And I keep that llama drawn
For the haters that go without like Ramadan
I am Malcolm X, but outta my mouth comes sex
A lot of 'em doubt son's blessed
But I rip and out comes checks
I get it but never will I get got, no
Let a thing that gets hot blow
Like I'm living in shish kebab, Shawshank Redemption
CHI-CA-GO
Tecca Neezy, look at me and believe me
I'ma get all the beezies, being me ain't this easy
Once they get up on it, yeah they want it and never leave me
'Cause I flow with Mackenzie Nicole, Kali, and Stevie
Never find glee 'cause they know I'm where the clever rhymes be
And I keep that better shine, make the cheddar climb
Baby, nevermind me

[Pre-hook: Krizz Kaliko & Mackenzie Nicole]
Party like it's Night and Day
Living crazy is the only way
Get you where I got you when I'm on it
Bop it, lock it like you really want it
Oh, Hey!

[Hook: Mackenzie Nicole]
I don't wanna ever have to pay bills again
Time for me to work, I think I'll call in
Everyday's a weekend so let's go
