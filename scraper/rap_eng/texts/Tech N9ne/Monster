[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Turn that shit up a little bit, Juan
For these motherfuckers can feel what I'm sayin'
Yeah, like that, yo!
(Monster!)
(Monster!)
(Monster!)
(Monster!)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
When I was 5 years old I realized there was a road
At the end I, would win lots of pots of gold
Kindergarten teacher knew I was impossible
Gots to grow dick quick to cock the ho'
Evil breed, we smoke weed without seeds
T do dirty deeds, feed foul fiends, what they need
Walk around with a switchblade in 6th grade
You'll get blade, If you display bitch or Mitch Bade
Have you ever, sold a preacher
Crack on Sunday, fucked your teacher?
7th grader, under bleachers
Losing data, smokin' reefer
Hasta el amigo, hasta luego
Hasta le fake hoes, after I pop, I stop when I stay low
Damn clown from Kan Town, many man found
There's a monster breed here, nigga, stand down!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Monster!) If you wanna act like me
(Monster!) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster!) Makin' niggas skat like me
(Monster!) Dumpin' hella crack like me
(Monster!) You can always act like me
(Monster!) Ain't gotta be black like me
(Monster!) Keep a hold of your brat tightly
(Monster!) He just might be (Monster!)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne & Don Juan]
It must be in my blood, it must be in my soul
I'm musty in the mud, I'm dusty in my clothes
Don't trust me, I'm a scrub, don't fuck with me, I'm cold
I'm quick to hold a grudge, don't touch, I might explode
I'm made for wrong, spent too many days alone
Blaze the bong, had to many cervezas holmes
And it gets shittier, hit me ya
Bitch I [?] ya, accidentally passing chlamydia
What kind of nigga, take X, but never heard of, safe sex?
What kind of nigga never think of learnin'?
Make his momma suck dick while he burnin'
Who's that nigga chuggin' liquor while Slim Shady bumpin'?
Who shot dem niggas down
On land and 80 somethin', (TECH N9NE!)
Them drug dealers, who think they know where evil lurks now
Who's that committing sexual acts on church ground?

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Monster!) If you wanna act like me
(Monster!) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster!) Makin' niggas skat like me
(Monster!) Dumpin' hella crack like me
(Monster!) You can always act like me
(Monster!) Ain't gotta be black like me
(Monster!) Keep a hold of your brat tightly
(Monster!) He just might be (Monster!)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Mama never knew wassup
She never knew I would turn beast when I grow up
She never thought that I'd know clutch
I hung with niggas in the hood who never gave a fuck
I'm a creature from the black platoon
Pass the shrooms, last for doom
With half a moon
Still howling, Lord knows I been a very
Bad boy fucking little Lory in Forest Hill cemetery
The definition of a bad boy
Use to hit niggas for repping this and never had joy
And I never ever really had toys
So I started playing with .38s making mad noise
Who killed fetuses
Who needed this GHB to get heated, immediate
We get weeded be on some conceited shit
Many more coming
Because, because, because
It's dark off in Kansas City, nigga
The Land of Oz

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Monster!) If you wanna act like me
(Monster!) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster!) Makin' niggas skat like me
(Monster!) Dumpin' hella crack like me
(Monster!) You can always act like me
(Monster!) Ain't gotta be black like me
(Monster!) Keep a hold of your brat tightly
(Monster!) He just might be (Monster!)

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
That's real, that's just a piece, baby
That's just a little piece of the story
Got much-much more to tell y'all

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
(Monster!) If you wanna act like me
(Monster!) You gotta pop a gat like me
(Monster!) Makin' niggas skat like me
(Monster!) Dumpin' hella crack like me
(Monster!)
(Monster!)
(Monster!)
(Monster!)
(Monster!)

And told you a lot since then, I have, man. This next one was never supposed to surface out of respect for my spouse, but--- Since I lost everybody that I love to this music, I guess it really doesn't fucking matter anymore, does it?
