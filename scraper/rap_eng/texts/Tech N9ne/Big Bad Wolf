[Hook]
I've got my
Gun on spray, so don't try to *pop* *pop*
Run away, hit 'em with the big bad wolf
86 sick streak inside of me

[Verse 1]
I'm giving 'em a dilemma
The coming of a killer, the phantom
Of all niggas who wanna be Nina
But listen
I kill a bitch in a vision of "Milli-Vanilli"
Motherfuckers who's being murdered by the big bad wolf
Computerism, I'll give em a Push
Ripped you and your mocking crew
What you gonna do when I pop at you, Glock at you
Fill em with the venom. Who the fuck are you talking to?
Betray me? you crazy! The Keyser SÃ¶ze, Kevin Spacey
Niggas hate me, can't face me
Bitches like Cagney and Lacey, basically, you can't ace me
I put that on school is the Lil Tracey, ya better mace me, 'cause I'mma fuck up a niggas career
If you think you trying to bite me, taste me; listen to me
Like guerilla monsoon, I'mma a wolf, so I howl at the motherfucking moon
I can smell a rotten fella, cotton dwella; hella props to the jella, my nigga loom
Two little pigs, niggas who wanted to be the big bad wolf, Tecca Nina clone
That's why this little piggy hit the carpet and the other little piggy stayed home

[Bridge]
Chrome, huff and I'll puff
And I'll blow that fucking mic down and stuff
Hit me with a silver bullet and get it outta me
Cause a weak bullet is only a mini-technicality
Follow me nigga
If you gotta be Nina to get a bigger salary, motherfucker
To bust flows like Joe's or like those
Who make relish and throw midwest blows at foes
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look [x3]
You being a bitch as in Brooke, you're nothing but a crook
So you niggas can't fuck with the big bad wolf

[Hook]
I've got my
Gun on spray, so don't try to *pop* *pop*
Run away, hit 'em with the big bad wolf
86 sick streak inside of me

[Verse 2]
You thought you built your rhyme out of some brick
Tech N9ne blew 'em away like stick
Let's find, who got the way tight licks
I bet mine, you'll get em, cause they like this
The real shit, Mama Mia, Disagree-A, I really better see a-then be a
Cause when a nigga flowed what he wrote, sorry
That's all folks Ah-Ba-Dee-Ah-Ba-Dee-Ah-Ba-Dee-Ah
You little niggas, you can't fuck with the wolf
You a devil with hooves and death books
Came to a Tech N9ne show and got took
By the lyrical anghellical voice that's shook
Satan, the lord rebutes ya. The power of Christ compels you
To get the kcuf away from the ish
I'm spitting; you're losing, I'm sorry to tell you
Who the man now? Who the man now?
Motherfucker, you a student, put ya hand down
Tryna growl like a wolf, tryna pop like a Tech N9ne
Little nigga, you can peck mine
I'mma hairy motherfucker with whiskers and I flips a
Hella script from here to Lamaviska
Kiss the fist of a nigga who walks so hard on niggas like you
I'll get a goddamned blister

[Bridge]
Nigga, huff and I'll puff
And I'll blow that fucking mic down and stuff
Hit me with a silver bullet and get it outta me
Cause a weak bullet is only a mini-technicality..
Follow me nigga
If you gotta be Nina to get a bigger salary motherfucker
To bust flows like Joe's or like those
Who make relish and throw midwest blows at foes
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
Take another look, you ain't off the hook, you been peeking in my book nigga, look
You being a bitch as in Brooke, you're nothing but a crook
So you niggas can't fuck with the big bad wolf

[Hook]
I've got my
Gun on spray, so don't try to *pop* *pop*
Run away, hit 'em with the big bad wolf
86 sick streak inside of me

[Outro]
I've got my gat on ya tongue, so don't try to...*pop* *pop*
Duck and run
Cause I'mma let ya know that wolf in reverse says flow
I gotta big bad flow and I'mma let ya nigga know that I rip it, Cause I believe
Six, six, triple eight, forty-six, ninety-nine three
Do ya know
Big...Bad...Wolf...Smash...Chrome...Dome...Long...Gone...
