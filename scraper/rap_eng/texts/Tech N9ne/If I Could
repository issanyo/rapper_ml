[Intro (x4)]
Could have, could

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Listen!
I know I'm always gone and I ain't never home
And plus you barely ever hear me on the telephone
Just trying ta sell a song, till my bright angel is known
And my hell is shown, but if I rest
It's just like all my mail is thrown
All away, all the day yawl a say call the way
A love one calls to say "All's at Bay", hog and stay for a holiday
But I'm far away, gotta pay lot of K
For my daughters way, son and mommas, they sobbing'
And it's problems when I'm away
But I gotta go get it, lotta dough in it
Hunnid percent, I'm in it ta fly and road grit it
Tecca N9na be raking it up when I go spit it
But it get to me when the family cry, no shit it
Becomes hella hurtful, yo, feel like I'm runnin' around in circles
If I could I would, I would stop, but I might go bazerko

[Hook: Chino Moreno]
But if I could, I would be good
I would be there for you just like I should
You wouldn't cry, when I say goodbye
For the reasons, do not tell me why
But if I could, I would be good
I wouldn't leave you, you think that I would
It feels like I die, a little inside
Know I hurt you when I say goodbye

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I know your heart is skipping
Cause I'm on a mission
Your eyes and schnoz are dripping
Cause your dog is missing
And you, his broad and wishing he wasn't a freaking politician
You want his kissing and you hope and pray that God is listening
You want to frolic with him
But he gotta get them dollars, give them
All of his grin, polished scripts and they all assist him
Now he's balla big and tall ambition, you're fallen friction
Cause you miss your body's twitching
Throbbing from his rod incisions
So you started fishing
Websites and call him, bitching
Thinking some broad is nibbling on his dick and y'all is drifting
But he just say "Nah" to chickens
All of this when cause is given
If I could I would dissolve suspicion

[Hook]

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Just trust me, please, just trust me
I'm doing all this music, so we can go all over the world
I swear to God, I'mma take you all over the world baby
We're gonna go, to Hawaii, we gonna stay for months
You always knew I wanted to go to Hawaii
And we're gonna go all over the world baby
If you just give me time
I'm gonna get this right, and do what I'm supposed to do
I swear to God we're gonna go, all over the world
We're gonna take, long trips
We're gonna go to Japan
We're gonna go to Africa
Wherever you wanna go, all I need
Is a little bit of time
A little bit more time, all I need is time
