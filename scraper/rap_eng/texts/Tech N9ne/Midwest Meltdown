[Verse 1: T.T.]
Game on, light a match
I'm blowing up, that's a known fact
Accelerant, lighter fluid gas
Burning every beat up, we
Spending money fast, even burn my cash
Everything around me smell like smoke
Blowin' on something that’s really no joke
Know they gettin' high when they start to choke
Ain't smokin' on reg', it’ll burn my throat
It’s Tech N9ne, T.T, and Twista (speak about the fire)
Switching lanes, 500 horses
Top back, you know my Swishers getting split like divorces
Can never burn out, no doubt, we get smoked out
Roll some White Widow to the grass 'til I pass out
Say you told 'em how, so tell me what you talkin' 'bout

[Hook: T.T.]
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)

[Verse 2: Twista]
It's only right that Twista speak about the fire
Lovin' the feelin' when I fill up a Backwood
Smoke the blunt up 'til I'm fucked up
Cough 'til I wanna upchuck, now I'm feelin' good
Takin' a hit of it then I be going up into oblivion
When I be blowin' the Afghani or the OG
Kush, talking 'bout a bush
If I see you blowin' purple, nigga
I wanna hit it, act like you know me
Always blowin' loud with my people
Flow so good that my style is evil
Steady spinnin' on my women in the summer
Like lemons in the Hummer, I got Sour Diesel
Smokin' Headband, make a nigga do a headstand
Green crack make me lean back
From the Chi' to the twin cities, ready to spend 50
Pullin' up your block, have you seen that?

[Hook: T.T.]
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Tech livin' it up, straight givin' it up, sex diggin' in guts
Women know I'm makin' everything cream
Wreck it then I bust, that's when I'm in lust, wet women are sexy
And Richie Richie, Professor Keenbean
I got the fire for lady luck I'm a live wire
If she's a thicky thick and get the grit up then I'll fly her
Buy her desires then annihilate her midnight attire
Then deny it, say I've had better, bitch, liar, liar!
Fly to Dubai up in the sky, I'ma spit the flame
Quick to rippin' and get to the trippin' if lippin' with the gang
Get the picture frame, for the nigga to get the blame
Grip the pistol, bang! Through your nipple, the missile came
You better know this SooWoo bidness, nigga!
Don't wanna fuck around and get lead up in your liver
Better consider, I'm a heavy hitter to spit a gat
So watch your mouth when you speak to me 'fore I give you that

[Hook: T.T.]
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)
Set your city on (fire)
I'm burnin' like (fire)
I'll smoke you out (fire)
I'll melt you like (fire, like fire)
(Like fire, like fire)
