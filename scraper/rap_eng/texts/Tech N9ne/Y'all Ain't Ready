Uh, y'all need to know
Talking bout, move over in this hoe, it’s going down

These boys talking on the low
What they need to know is I’m ready for em (I’m ready), I’m ready for em (I’m ready)
Right now you’re fucking with a pro
For years I had to flow so get ready for, get ready for
Y'all ain’t ready, ready, ready These boys talking on the low
What they need to know is I’m ready for em (I’m ready), I’m ready for em (I’m ready)

I got songs with Big Scoob, I did joints with Tech N9ne
You ain’t gotta think I’m a sick dude
But you’ll always gonna respect mine (for real)
Ain’t no need to check blind
Cause as long as the check’s signed
I'ma kill it when I spit it
And when I’m finished with it there isn’t gonna be a next time
A lot of local rappers, want to come up off my fame and success
Like a heart attack it’s killing me
I feel it like a pain in my chest
I no longer say I’m the best
Old heads say I’ve been blessed
Really ain’t nothing to it I just do it with the music
And you know I aim for success (and I get it)
Say it with your chest, cause you know I’m still gon do me
Keep that beef to yourself, cause it’s not even industry
Got people that’s in the streets
And they always look out for me
From the north and the east and the west
And you know I got some homies in the south for me
Yeah, and I do it big, ain’t nobody gonna do it bigger
Long as I’m around I'ma ride for the town
And I be running with some real killers
Better mash this cause I’m sharp as a cactus
Better yet like attack this
Killing these motherfuckers with my spitting, I’m really doing backflips

These boys talking on the low
What they need to know is I’m ready for em (I’m ready), I’m ready for em (I’m ready)
Right now you’re fucking with a pro
For years I had to flow so get ready for, get ready for
Y'all ain’t ready, ready, ready These boys talking on the low
What they need to know is I’m ready for em (I’m ready), I’m ready for em (I’m ready)

[Tech N9ne]:
Steady, I get up on the track and tap it cuz I'm ready
To get the party poppin' like I was confetti
The way they be dissin' Tecca Nina be plum petty
Niggas be wonderin' how did I become bready
Cause I'm 'bout it, 'bout it, damn it them rappers you got is garbage
People I never could acknowledge, prob it's
Mourn like a motherfuckin (?)
With the K.O.Dly flow, nobody ever know where the bodies go
(Which way did they go, which way did they go?)
Did they go to heaven? I guess prolly NO
Especially if they be trippin with me
Suicide mission for thee,  get your miss and ya see
Nothin but Davy Jones locker nigga you rot with the fish in the sea
You dont know me, you dont want it
I can take a look and see that you dont want shit
So put the fuckin lotion in the basket, if you don't then your ghost and in a casket
Fight? I was hopin' you would ask it
Put the knife to your throat then you can have it
Your life is a joke and people laugh at it
But I spit the flows that be elaborate
Can't front on that, Tech N9ne killin' everyone on rap
I get better with every verse, or my gun on wax
Psychos know that I'm sick, my flows open yo' chick
My foes hopin' I quit because their hoes so close to my dick
