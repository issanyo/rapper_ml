[Spoken: Tech N9ne]
Music since '85, but me and Travis been doing this Strange Music thing for over 17 years. It's so wonderful to see the fan base still growing after all this time. You know what I'm sizzling, it's a blessing

Yes it is, indeed. So with all the success over (mm-hmm) the years, and even more success coming to Strange Music this year and beyond. Alright, give me one word. Give me just one word to describe what you think is coming your way when you feel you've reached the level of success you've worked so hard for. One word

[Spoken: Tech N9ne]
