[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I ain't bout to no dubs or chairs or nothin
This is real spill right here
Just one track

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
One of these days I'mma grow up and stop gettin toe up
One of these days I'mma blow up and show up plush
One day I'm really gonna go up chuck
I'm low, just stuck, cause lately it ain't no luck fuck
It's like my dough cut up the fact that I blow buck sucks
I need some more ducks to fold up and hold up stuff
I'mma roll up, what, some y(o)ellow stuff
Par for me, no rust, and no crust, I'm a sure nuf bust
One of these days fans are gonna blow up Kutt
Won't be anymore hush hush, about doin our show, just trust
And that statements cause of they no nough rush to go get my flow cuss ready amongst they soul duck us
I'm swole up, cause a hold just struck. Friggin IRS at my address, I'm ready to throw knucks up
One of these days I'mma go nuts, what, like right now this life styles cause it's so rough and tough

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
One of these days, I'll find what I'm lookin for
And I won't look no more
I'll say out loud that I'm here now
I walk on holy ground
One of these days, my life won't hold me down
One of these days. Ya, one of these days

[Verse 2: Prozak]
Yo
One of these days, I'll be comfortable in my own skin
Happy with what I have
Happy with who I am
Accept the things I can not change, and change the things I can
Achieve the wisdom to conquer these struggles from within
One of these days, I'm gonna forgive my enemies
Release these grudges and negative energies and just set it free
Life is to short for this baggage that attacks and then inhabits, like a savage monkey on your back that is ragged and rabid
One of these days I'mma undo all the bad that I've done
Correct the karma and try to make right by everyone
Every bridge I burned, trust me the lessons learned
Still dealin with these previous grievances that I've earned
One of these days I'll be buried and gone, all that will remain are the lyrics and vocals and hopes contained in this song
Life's about the path you have chosen thats gotch you hopin to get on through the door while it's still open, it's closin. One of these days.inhabits

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I wanna be a millionaire sooo fuckin bad (Forget about it)
But I should be thankful for the things that I have (You can live without it)

One of these days I'll get some plaques on the wall
Never be hated. Be rated one of the best of them all
Greatest of all times, play this in my mind about a million times before when I say this in my rhyme
Never know when it's time to go (K)
One of these days I'll get my spirit right, lyrics like I'm livin right. When you hear it you hear what I fear at night (OK)
One of these days I'll pay a bill when it's due
They messin with you, if you just owe a few to their revenue (OK)
Get off this emotional roller coaster I been riding
Live life to the fullest cause every day you keep on dyin
One of these days you won't see my vitiligo, and people will stop starrin where I go
One of these days

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
One of these days, I'll find what I'm lookin for
And I won't look no more
I'll say out loud that I'm here now
I walk on holy ground
One of these days, my life won't hold me down
One of these days. Yeah, one of these days
