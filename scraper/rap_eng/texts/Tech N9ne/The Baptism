[Intro]
I get on my knees and pray now
Can you hear me, Lord?
Hey, know what I'm talking about? Hey

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I'm falling, whether the sun waking up and I'm yawning
Touched from the spirit under this morning
He can turn to strike me, then inform me
Ain't y'all that was blessed, blessed with a gift, gift
Showing the light to my misfits
I've been baptized, got mine, praising the Lord and I got by
Polarized any and every strategy every tethered mind
I'm a raging changing
Over the hills and higher destination
Strange water is flowing, gravitating

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
Yeah, I'm coming out the water baptized
Coming out the water
Who am I? Coming out the water
Coming out the water baptized
Yeah, I'm coming out the water
Who am I? Coming out the water

[Verse 2: Rittz]
The devil never been a stranger to me
Prayed every day for the faith I’m losing
Had this shadow hanging over me when days were gloomy
Get a sense of the gray so much rage consumed me
I’d assume I'm cursed and I was doomed since birth
I got seduced by Medusa, but Lucifer won't let me loose
I'm using my mind to do his work
It's like I'm finding the vision inside my pupils blurred
All I did was sin little regard for life so much a ring was pinned inside
I’m hemorrhaging gone on a bench for 10 years
Feeling outta control but no ones too concerned
Feeling Satan’s wrath overdosing on meth committing heinous acts
With no restraints I had to make a change
Back to chains on the highway to hell but I refused to burn and then
One dark night I began to see the light, prayed to God
And said I'll leave this life and live for Christ
I know I've been a sinner and I' m fearful, need advice
And now I’m begging for forgiveness, God, the evil in me died
I dedicate my life to preachers try to lead the blind
I’ll find the younger me and show him I can be his guide
Baptized, matter fact I’m just glad to be alive
Tech, Stevie Stone, Rittz we arrive like

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Devil, I rebuke ya, we shoot ya, with the governor we're gonna' reduce ya
Bleed Lucifer to me
You will never be nothing but a hindrance
And a crew creature, ya B I-S-H, I move creepers to see, try that fate
My tool reach a degree, high at bake
You'll seek a school teacher, we'll be riot Yates
Teaching the demons to disperse if ya quick versed in a big hearse
Stopping the evil when it gets worse
I'mma clip squirt while they sip syrup
Dumping out bust with the power of God, I really live it, no, it's not a facade
Ambivalent when you think off me cause I'm an odd
Formidable killer but not an alla- mirage
Give a demon holy water
So he gotta feel the light and if he show me fraud he go me dollar
The evil I'm murkin' making him slowly martyr
The devil is an evil insurgent, gotta wash it out ya like a detergent
I'm an angel, never was a serpent
Jesus, I am Your servant

[Hook]
