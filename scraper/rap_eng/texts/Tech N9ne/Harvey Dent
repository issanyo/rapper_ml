[Intro]
This Tech N9ne baby
And I don't just do one thing
I'm everything
If I did one thing
All y'all would agree
But you don't
So want me to do some madness
Y'all want the crazy shit
But I just wanna kick it sometimes
Drink some fuckin' Caribou Lou; KC Tea GODDAMN!

[Verse 1]
They want madness, Anghellic and sadness
Fans relish when gladness is damned, devilish and ashes
But I like this cash, this massive magazine ad gets crackin'
Attractive chicks passin' is rap and actresses them asses
They want the clown, the paint and the evil frown
The drink and, the needle now, the taint and no feeble sounds
But I need your pounds, your pesos, your people down
With this label and I be so bound for that halo when I be low ground
They want that black magic, that savage with bad habits
And grab at and stab rabbits, the maggot that has cabbage
But I'm at that fast status with swagger that's past average
My glasses and rag matches don't mean flag and it's no blast added
They say bizarre he went, they love him in dark he vents
Toppin' the chart, he sent naughty shit to everybody's tent
I wanna be at the party bent listening to Parliament
Sorry this part of me's a gnarly gent, they call me (Harvey Dent)

[Hook]
People be talking 'bout
This and that sayin' it
Ain't a hit can I get
Back what I started with
Want my, want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums
Want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums (Harvey Dent)
People be talking 'bout
This and that sayin' it
Ain't a hit can I get
Back what I started with
Want my, want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums
Want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums (Harvey Dent)

[Verse 2]
They want the demon, the animal that spread the semen
The cannibal sign of the heathen, who's eatin' meat and no vegan
But I get my fees, and I'm reachin' for the decent skis
And a piece of the be frequent beats, and the freakin' be hit them cheesing
They want the dark knight, they want a bar fight
Hard bites, art is the smartest thing, in this scarred life
Women, that's our vice, they starin' at our ice
Matter what's at the tar lights? But I hit in the car twice
They want that killer clown, they want the milla sound
Gorilla that pill ya for scrilla, but I hold the villa down
I'm chinchilla now with Makzilla
I tap chillas you rap niggas you hate but it's still a crown
Just call me Two Face
On the right side; I got healthy pearly whites
On the left side I got a tooth ache
I'm Asmodeus, but then I'm Master Farah?
Black people think I'm a devil, and the white people think I'm a god

[Hook]
People be talking 'bout
This and that sayin' it
Ain't a hit can I get
Back what I started with
Want my, want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums
Want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums (Harvey Dent)
People be talking 'bout
This and that sayin' it
Ain't a hit can I get
Back what I started with
Want my, want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums
Want my old shit, buy my, buy my old albums (Harvey Dent)

[Outro]
People come up to me and they say they like the older stuff you know what im sayin'
Like 'Anghellic' and 'Calm Before The Storm
But I gotta evolve, you know what I'm sizzlin'?
I mean if you don't like the new shit then go buy the older shit
