[Chorus]
Givin' up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Your dreams take you away
Missin' out on the day to day...
Gave up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Stop where this journey ends
Over and over again...
Over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over
Over and over and over

[Tech N9ne]
Yo, Yo, Hey...
Get your tiny violins out
I'ma tell ya what the past ten years been 'bout
It's about sacrifice
Partner, rap's my vice
And it's lookin' like I'm get my reward in my afterlife
Cause down here it's crazy, baby
Gotta deal with a lot of "If, And's, and Maybe's", baby
Tryna make it to where I can take care of my babies' babies
Losin' nearly everybody I love, It kinda made me shady
I put, Hella Time in this, tryna shine and shit
Now that I'm prosperin', a sick and lonely N9ne, I sit
I'm consumed with this life and the grit
It's my world
But in turn I lost my Wife, My Bitch, and My Girl
And I lost time with my children
If you see me smilin', no, it's a real one
It's a real one
Cause we done came along way from Simply Sicilian
To my own buildin'
I sacrificed to make a million for my children...

[Chorus]
Givin' up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Your dreams take you away
Missin' out on the day to day...
Gave up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Stop where this journey ends
Over and over again...
Over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over
Over and over and over...

[Johnny Richter]
I've been away for three months
Patience wearin' real thin
Been Richter for twelve years
Sometimes just wanna be Tim
Sometimes just wanna be Chris's older brother
Have a regular life, with a wife, who's an expected mother
But as fate would have it, I started rappin'
So that regular life with the wife just ain't happenin'
At least not for now, but I still hope one day
The sacrifices I made will be handsomely repaid...

[D-Loc]
One the road, doin' shows, yea
I miss my girl
I can't wait to get home, yea
She knows she rocks my world
Put it down for the fam, man
Fam for life, D-F-L
Together forever, We sacrifice
Yea, baby, baby, give it to me raw
Let me give it to you
Like you give it to me
Put it down for ya man
Lemme put it down for you
The sex is so good
I can't wait to fuck you...

[Chorus]
Givin' up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Your dreams take you away
Missin' out on the day to day...
Gave up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Stop where this journey ends
Over and over again...
Over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over
Over and over and over...

[Daddy X]
In a warzone, walkin' on a strange land
God damn, I feel so far from home
Every night I spit my life into a microphone
It's what I do, I wouldn't change it for the world
But sometimes, I swear to god I miss my wife and girl
So bad, I think about the other side
A nine to five to survive, just to stay alive
Fuck that! I been there, done that!
No turnin' back, cause we stackin' money into stacks
I used to run with some rough-neck, punk-rockers
With a death wish, pop ya like a pop-locker
Most of them are either dead or behind bars
I got sick of loading friends into funeral cars
So everynight, when my two feet land on stage
I thank God that I live to see another day...

[Chorus]
Givin' up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Your dreams take you away
Missin' out on the day to day...
Gave up your life
Is it worth that sacrifice?
Stop where this journey ends
Over and over
Over and over and over
Over and over
Over and over and over...
