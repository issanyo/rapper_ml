[Intro]
Hey Ben, man, I think I might need a high hat or something to keep me on
Since we.. since I'm just providing the beat for the acapella
You know what I'm sizzling
Alright
Yeah, like that
What I'm about to do I'm about to give y'all the verse I did with Bone
I was supposed to do with Bone, called "Speed of Sound"
They ain't never put it out so I'ma give it to you right now, check it out

[Verse]
I be comin' like a autobahn I'm murderin' everything
I'm a killa with a mission to flip it
I'm sick with it give her the lip, and I be itchin' to give it
A whiff of the wicked I stick it with the crick and they're diggin' it
Nigga
Like I said it before I'ma get up and go and get it
Because I'm mr. malignant, keepin' you riveted
Livin' it polygamist sin a bit
Any chick in a minute Tecca N9na be kickin' it
I flow for the Middle West, go for your little neck
Don't let me get it but yo' ho - I'ma get her wet
Stop and drop on top a twat in your kitchen
Not the guap I pop without an admission
Hailing from Missouri, you can smell out the hell in the thizzery
Just remember me, bustin' deliveries and I'm makin' 'em shivery
I'm takin' my little city to lyrical liberty

[Hook]
I go for the gusto don't leave the ground, no bush to beat around
All the Midwest Choppers on this track and "yes sir we are down"
Tecca N9na with Bone everybody gets on other MC's we are clown
And we do it like a bullet from a gun or better yet the speed of SOUND!
