[Hook x2: Krizz Kaliko]
Put some weight on it
Dance for me now

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ya!
You have now entered your girls psyche
You no longer have to wonder where she might be
You seem to be misled 'bout her line of work
Don't get your feelings hurt
Cause I done seen her (twerk)
She told you that she work
For sprint cleverly
But something so thick will just an occupation will never be
And what she makin' it sounds good like laraby
But she says she specialize in message therapy
You a dummy, Your chick is gettin' money
From lettin' these ballaholics lay deep off in her tummy
Just like Fat Tone say: I know what she did
Suck dick all day and went kiss on your kids
Now shes kissin' on you
Instead spittin' she true
Tet your lovin' that she ballin' but she twistin' the crew
Pissin' on who? White dudes be frisking your boo
Call girl by the night is what she fixin to do
Homie, re-evaluate it cause your woman might be
Bad for brothas like you good for niggas like me
Look away partna let your lady go to work
It's bout to be the first
So baby go on and (twerk)

[Hook x2]
Hey shorty what's your name?
What you willin' to do for me to tip that thang
You better twerk sum'n (put some weight on it)
Baby girl ya better work sum'n (dance for me now)

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Dream girl hey stop put some weight on it
Don't wanna give it to me mama I'ma wait on it
Baby you worth it
Not just cause the way you twerk it
This urk a jerk it
Got me feelin' like you're perfect and I'ma try it
I know you got a man
I'll be your man on the side and we can find a place to hide out
Hey and if you slide out
Baby be careful just what you lyin bout nobody can find out
Sex been part of her since the start of her
Mama was a harlot
And she gave it to her daughter and i love it (i love it)
So throw that ass at me and ima throw it back like a quarterback
Cause its lookin' sorta fat
Pay for your schoolin' with the lap dance
And after we can advance to somethin'
Deep you wantin' me to feed the meter
Pull you away for a minute
From that jerk while you work
And lets to the back and close the curtain cause i love the way you

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Snug Brim]
Damn you lookin' like youcanova
So put the lock on me girl i heard that yous a trooper
We in the strip club of course i got plenty chalupa
You see these stacks on the table ima let them pursue ya
My mouth don't say a word you know what i wanna see
Come place that pretty round brown right in front of me
No disrespect but bend over let me lift the skirt
I'm fittin' to slap some naked ass while i watch it twerk

[Verse 4: Skatterman]
We watch work watch it pop watch it jerk
Leave a couple thousand on the table you can watch it first
Lil niggas have your fun the skatterman is goin to flirt
Strange lane in the building all the bitches goin' berserk
All day shes a service rep at nextel
But when she get home to you she got that sex smell
Exhale nigga get your thumb out your butt
I know it hurts for you to find out your wife is a slut
