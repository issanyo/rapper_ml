So, me and Krizz Kaliko check into our uh... Hotel in Paris, France. We were there for the first time, you know, it's in 2010 and our hotel was so fucking rinkydink that when we checked in our room -- it was so small that you open the front door to our room and you could see, hold up -- (Police sirens wail) You could see the nigga at the front desk. He was like, you just open the door and he was right there. So Krizz Kaliko goes and asks the nigga like, uh, ey man, y'all got the WiFi? And the dude was like "wh- WiFi? WiFi? I dunno, WiFi?" "You know, WiFi man, you got WiFi? WiFi code?" He's like "what, no, we don't WiFi." He's like "you know, like internet, like phone" and he's like "ohhh, Weefee, Weefee, yeah we got Weefee."
