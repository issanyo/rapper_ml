Bad Season

Interviewer: Now, as far as the whole DJ Whoo Kid incident, how did that make you feel when you heard it, how did you find out about it, and how did it all get squashed? Because I understand he went on Twitter saying he was gonna cancel the mixtape

Tech N9ne: Okay. Because of what he said, I'm in the hotseat. And I know he didn't mean anything by it, he ain't that kinda dude, you know what I'm sizzling? He said something fucked up on accident, just playing around, just playing around, you know what I'm saying? He said something that offended my fans, so the fans look at me like "oh, okay, what's Tech gonna do?" I'm in the hotseat. Goddammit! I'm in here doing my job, now I'm in the hotseat because of something them niggas said, you know so it's on accident. So, therefore, if we abort this, all the beats are go away, which we wrote everything around these beats, you know what I'm sizzling? But I had to look at it broad-spectrum. Everybody got something on this, you know what I'm saying? XXL is into this, you know what I'm saying? Whoo Kid's people is into this. Strange Music is into this. The fans are into this, you know what I'm saying? So if I just abort, everything just falls, for no reason, you know what I'm saying? So the fans ultimately said, "we want Bad Season."
