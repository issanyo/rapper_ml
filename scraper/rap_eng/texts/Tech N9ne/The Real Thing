Drink, this is unreal, beyond me
The Real Thing cross the path of Suwandi

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]
What is real? You must decide
'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!
This pain is mine, and I’d bleed for you
I cannot lie, 'cause I die for you!
Believe me I die!
Believe me I die!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hey!
I'm the real thing they can check my stats
All over USA, Overseas, and back
I didn't get out of this shit through crack
Education and motivation and just do rap
Built all my fans, one by one
They lovin' the bullets coming from my gun
They do cry for me, digging the alpha me
I'm giving the spirited heart from my tongue
How can you say my life is make believe?
When everybody call me for rent, I paid the G's
I create the "C" notes, we dope
So why the hate, 'cause he broke, we growth
When I look around I see jokes
With a whole lot of boss and boast
Maudie taught me to not be flossy
'Cause these copies will doubt me, close

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]
What is real? You must decide
'Cause when I'm here, I cannot hide!
This pain is mine, and I’d bleed for you
I cannot lie, 'cause I die for you!
Believe me I die!
Believe me I die!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hey!
They say my shit is glamour and glitz
And all they think I'm doing is hammering chicks
When I'm gone, they'll be slandering this
But when I'm around, you a stammering bitch
Just give it up 'cause our cut is due
Tech lit up and it's better than you
Never in blue, better than runes
Made my money off of summerin' fools
I'm the real thing!
I can rap bitch!
And I don't know nobody that's disputin' that shit
Put on my mask, spittin' fast, get the cash quick
How does it feel to be real?
It's fucking fantastic!

[Hook: Liz Suwandi]

Believe me I die!
