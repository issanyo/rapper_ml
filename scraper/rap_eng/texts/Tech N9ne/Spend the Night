[Chorus: Paul Law]
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody

[Verse 1: Rock Money]
Well first of all I come with players [?]
You couldn't even rule your bitch
Well here's a nigga that rules the whole fuckin' galaxy
Jealous me I'm the baddest, I'm the coldest I'm a poet
I get so many responses when I let these bitches know it
I got gin, I got juice, a deadly combination
I keep lyrics I produce, with bomb compensation
I get down in dirty seven I got to get you on your knees
Dub my money on the Benz so I can fuck you with my T shit
Let these hoes tell it, and I'm the boss
I get in it from behind then I make a special sauce
Tossin' my salad, makes the freak invalid
Plus you callin' my name out while we fuckin' to my palace
[?] come, leaving you numb
But that's just the dick and I get wicked with the tongue then I'm king 'em
I can't be modest [?] is what they call us
Just a second word of meaning makes me pull up the exotic
[?] I'm paying mami two ga
We gotta fuck 'til we either one of us is physically drained
It's same [?] now ready and willing to 56
Leavin' my niggas with blue balls and hard dicks
Ladies prepare for this 'cause game I got
Why stick the simple niggas? Now our game a lot
This for my niggas out there this worse for me
So roll the dice, spend the night out with a G

[Chorus: Paul Law]
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
What's happenin' baby it's Tech
I'm callin' to see if you're down for heated sex
So we can flex and you can lick the barcode on my neck
I'm hella twisted off of a RÃ©my and greens
I feel like lickin' and stickin' and flippin' 'til I make you cream
Scream, I'm at the embassy, on the country club
Plaza it has a hot tub and plus I got love
See you in 30 I'm dirtier I promise you no faulty day
I clean myself up and spray on some Jean Paul Gaultier
I left your key at the desk, I'm waiting on the real
I got us pomani chilled I love what you kinda feels
Tackled the clippers like a pro, when I go below
I make it feel like a hunnid degrees when it's four below
I got you [?] and don't you tryna to front
Let's fuck all the faking and let us get us what we want
Pull 'em down turn around by nine down [?]
I lick my lips to let you know that I'm ready and bite the bottom
When I get drenched, how does it feel to have your nipples nibbled and pinched
When taking every inch, I love it when you flinch
You make me think that I'm using the force
Hold on I'm 'bout to end this motherfucker like a main course
I got you shivering quivering you love it
After I lick it you pull me by my hair, and told me to shove it
Your eyes keep saying, "Why it feel so good?"
I make you jerk out after three rounds, I'm a still go wood
It's over and shit, I smoke another clover and shit
You spent the night with a G now it's over and shit
Did it so good you want me to give you your first child
You listen to my records and smile 'cause I made it worthwhile

[Chorus: Paul Law]
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
Spend the night with a G
'Cause we ain't gon' hurt nobody
