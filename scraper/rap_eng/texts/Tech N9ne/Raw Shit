This that raw shit that'll start a mosh pit
Head bangers get to spazzin' out and be like "aww shit"
This that raw shit that'll start a mosh pit
Head bangers get to spazzin' out and be like "aww shit"
This that raw shit that'll start a mosh pit
Head bangers get to spazzin' out and be like "aww shit"
This that raw shit that'll start a mosh pit
Head bangers get to spazzin' out and be like "aww shit"

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
This that off ish from the King of Darkness
Can't stop this mob shit awfully heartless
Elemental toxic caustic could have lost your optic
With a millimeter boss get soft in it pissed off this mosh pit
Einstein Tech N9ne shines behind thine rhymes
I'm signed to mine flyin' to find fine wine
I can design lines that'll get me to climb dimes
Pieces them fine beetches, never tweet it, just grind blind
Get up out this pit
You without sickness
Better get in the back of me 'fore your mouth get split
Never look at a killer nigga when you're on the curb
Beggin' like you tougher, softer than fur
Get to pokin' out with some ladies do
Think they man enough with a gun they be through
But if Tecca N9na said he coo with it
In a blink, I would do a 180 too

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
We off what we all sick in frost pit
Everybody bosses and y'all is nauseous!
Be cautious we all trippin' balls it's
Raw 'til we fall in this mosh pit
Aww shit!

[Verse 2: Bun B]
In the middle of nothingness I'm the light in the void
Sittin' on big rims, swollen like they been takin' some 'roids
You scared partner 'cause you look kinda 'noyed
Like I'm about to put hands on you like Pretty Boy Floyd
I got 'em sick mayne, somebody call a specialist
Tell these haters "Fall back and get up off that extra shit"
Who want what with us? You gon' be the next to get
Smashed up out your comfort zone and you'll be by your neck in shit
Quit acting like what it is is and it's gon' be
And you got no say in this situation it's on me
They know me well from Third Ward to Zone Three
And we gon' take this movement from Long Island to Long Beach
Too trill, Wes is on the horizon
So when the sun shinin' on us it shouldn't be so surprisin'
You know we plan on your demise so playa
You gon' be six feet under while I'm 300 feet and risin' bitch

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
We off what we all sick in frost pit
