[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's no way to get me off of the ceiling
I don't ever wanna let go of this feeling
I can't come down
Yeah
No I can't come down
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I am so lifted 'cause I am so gifted
The misfits is with it, that's why they buy mo' tickets
When I rip shit in triplets
No hate behind those crickets
You may find mo' bitches givin' N9ne those digits
Man on the moon
People think I pop a lot of
Xans on the shrooms
Nada, but I puff and never
Land up at noon
Never coming down when I leave ya
Hands I'ma zoom
From this day, it's this way
Up and away from a itch bade
Sitting on top of this pay
After so many years of brick lay
I'ma sit stay in the sick bay
Halted never 'cause I'm exalted
Bet I never get off this
Bed they bred this big boss shit
Dancing on the ceiling on Planet Pyune
'Cause man is doomed
On Earth is hurt we'll all vanish soon
This high it could be
From the pressure when other fans push me
So high, higher than female alien pussy

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's no way to get me off of the ceiling
I don't ever wanna let go of this feeling
I can't come down
Yeah
No I can't come down
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
If everyday was a payday
I'd get high with you baby
Like inhale, exhale
Like inhale, exhale

[Verse 2: Stevie Stone]
Yeah
This stage reloaded
Room packed, adrenaline
Crown whore with a stone cone
Taste buds like cinnamon
Tear down I'm a stage killer
When I walk away hard Benjamin
Couple of naysayers and they feel its win
When I grip down I'm killing 'em
Last round I leveled up
Next round I'ma spaz on 'em
Progress couple of year sounds
Steady paced I'ma gas on them
Top tier like got a mirror
I'ma be around, never last homie
Scott Chad no IG
Like Cuzzaloink with the mask on me
Never do I wanna let go
Projecting up in the billies
Roaming deep like let's hoe
New way lemme vindicate
Promenade I'm a vet tho
Renegade lemme innovate
I'ma generate like plethora
Taking respect tho
It's different the moment
I'm high clinging to the stars
You can show me opponents
I'm high gifted up in the mind
Haters wanna condone it
I'm high up in the sky unfound and I can't come down

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's no way to get me off of the ceiling
I don't ever wanna let go of this feeling
I can't come down
Yeah
No I can't come down
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
If everyday was a payday
I'd get high with you baby
Like inhale, exhale
Like inhale, exhale

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
I feel like I'm just this guy, this kid
In the body or in the the brain of this dude
Who writes this crazy music
And this Tech N9ne guy is taking me all over the world
