[Hook: Darrein Safron]
Lately baby maybe I been thinking 'bout you
Pull up in that Masi' and that's all I gotta do
You so fine girl, you deserve you some
'ever you want girl, pick out some
It's all for you, aw yeah it's all for you
Pull up in that Masi' and it's all I gotta do
Pull up in that Masi' and I got it for you

[Verse 1: Darrein Safron]
Lately baby maybe I been thinking 'bout you
Is she bad, I tell her whip around the house and come through
Haters sendin' shots, that's okay, I just move
She leave him, she come through
Pussy bomb, it go boom, and I
Tell her that I make it, never hesitated
Breaded from the showme, you don't know me homie
Boy I'm so high, I'm a god
Foreign girls say bon voyage
I was in the city working hard
I was broke trying to get my cake up
So my homies, homie keep ya patience
Now we hear like I told you we make it
Do this for my ex, watch it
Do this for my ex, watch it
She mad that we pop it
I tell her, "Do not put me up in no gossip"
Unless you talkin' 'bout sending me profit
Homie, I do not know why they be hatin'
While he's wastin' time, he's working my patience
Her GPS me, I'm under the radar
You know Tech N9ne had to sign a player

[Hook]
Lately baby maybe I been thinking 'bout you
Pull up in that Masi' and that's all I gotta do
You so fine girl, you deserve you some
'ever you want girl, pick out some
It's all for you, aw yeah it's all for you
Pull up in that Masi' and it's all I gotta do
Pull up in that Masi' and I got it for you

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I know you want to take a photo
What she said to a nigga on the low-low
Beautiful enough to get the mojo goin'
And make a nigga spend up his show dough
Don't give a fuck if she taken
We could get then I'ma hit when the day come
Me sticking must'a been a great one
Cause she send videos of masturbation
I get you anything you want
Long as you givin' me that monk
And deliver me that skunk
We like enemies that funk
When we hit the sack, attack and I remedy ya rump
Level yo bed, I'ma splurge
Ya always got the urge to give incredible head
Medical shreds, never no rage
Puffin' the heavenly, give the Devil no cred
That's what we do
Am I punching yo chick? Oh shit, that could be true
You didn't notice, Tech will be due
To stick and poke it, Yes sir we screw
She stay on my time
You should've never, ever ever let her come and try N9ne
Nigga now when you see her, she be bust up smellin' like hotline by number nine
