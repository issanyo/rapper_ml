Cased in halls and hushed of sound
On the rack is art in heaven
Always hitting on all sevens

Make of me thy subject Lord
Placed according to thy word
Never inter crossed in heaven

In chapter, verse and sentence heard

Caste one, kept as pets
Caste two, steer the flock
Caste three, plumes and pelts
Caste four, birds of song
Caste five, watching dogs
Caste six, preying beast
Caste seven, working horses

Pressed and kept beneath thy glass
Every heart thy sent in heaven
Always hitting on all sevens
