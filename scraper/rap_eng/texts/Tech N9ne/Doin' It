[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Strange Music 10 years in the makin'
Hey man, this feel like I'm in Miami, Florida, man
But reppin' Kansas City at the same time
Yukmouth, Chillest Illest
Yo, Tech N9ne! Ome, let's go!

[Hook: Ome]
I'm doin' it!
I can do anything go shop
Buy fly high no lookin' back
I'm doin' it!
Take a trip everyday
Livin' life all paid build an Empire State
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
I'm doin' it (doin' it)
Buy low, sell high!

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Euro, pounds, crowns, get dough
Red Light District, hoes in the window
At the Green House blowin' on the indo
Then it's to the room and the cab is the Benzo
Yo, then I'm on to the next
Jigga Man style blowin' zones on a jet
High above 20 inch chrome on a (?)
Got hoes on deck, got a home on my neck
Yup, wrist flooded in cruise ship
Two chicks, I'd have pop it like Whoo Kid
Shut 'em all down, no brand new shit
Louie to the Gucci bitch I do's this
What? I get brain (?)
The Last Train to Paris
Like Diddy for them benjies
Black stones and a chain, black Bentley
All black everything flier than a frisbee

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chillest Illest]
Chillest Illest, yaah, yo
I'm doin' it weller than (?)
Globetrottin', I'm hot, I'm a young yacht seller
(?) when I land her
Make it to Japan
(?)
I'm a boss
(?)
Carnival cruisin', exchange currency
All about my paper I'm serious like an emergency
Some of y'all ain't heard of me but I'm about to fix that
(?)
I spits a lot of game you should absorb it
And no I don't pay rent partner I pay mortgage
Checking NASDAQ (?)
And all that you imagine
Oh yeah I'm doing that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Sold out shows Nina make 'em go nuts
They get the dough cut, splittin' hella O's up
Close up to show rush to go to Lust Vegas
The Tower Suites encore doin' for much
Cold days in Missouri can't stand them
So I take the family to Saint Martin just to tan 'em
Kickin' at random beaches then when I land 'em
The bags in the van, wife and kids in the Phantom
Royal Caribbean floating through amphibians
Go to Disney and pig and eat at the Grand Meridian
Wealthy Kansas Citian, pretty women, Henn and lemon or lime
Why she all up in mine? I'm Tech N9ne
And gettin' mo' checks, my life is so jet
I got a Mercedes Benz I ain't drove yet
Order your beast filet straight chewing it
Haters want me to ruin and never stop the Nina cause it's

[Bridge: Ome]
Full traffic escorts
New market passports
We're closing airports
Do anything!

[Hook]

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Okay this means we through doin' it now
This was the mixed plate
Now I'm 'bout to go to Gates and get me a president's tray
Y'all know what I mean, ha-ha-ha
Kansas City baby this album was for you
I don't care what nobody say
I love this place!
