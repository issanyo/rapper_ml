[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
I-I-I-In the mix
You're in the mix with your boyfriend, baby
Bobby Bang and it’s that time for the hot 9 at 9
With Tech N9ne featuring Shawnna
'Bout to wear that ass out ten ways to Sunday
So you better eat your Wheaties

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
My energy's pumping, it's finna be something to see
'Cause when I be drunken, it's sin to be humping with me
If women be crunk and authentic we jump in the B
Then I'm in it, we bumpin' to the finish, T punching the V
Like a prize fighter, eyes light up, when I glide by the thighs
Try the size, why the cries? 'Cause I be the pied piper
Wide or tighter, I like her pie-diver, prize swiper
Rider all night to the hide hiker
I been away for a long while, sick of just being your phone-pal
You might be needing your long towels, when I get to you, it's on now, wow!
Better gas up when you with the King Kong, gal
Get it, pivot, women dig it, lick it, then I hit it
Girl, that's my grown style!
I'm really gonna be living in what you're giving, I'm all over you like I'm Pepé Le Pew
Give me the goodies, I wanna know if you wanna get on top of me, no I gotta be when I'm stepping to you
Giving it what It needed repeated I fill it up when I beat it
You never want me to leave it, you gotta please me thorough
If you wanna piece of a gorilla, you want it with Tecca N9na
Better eat your Wheaties, girl!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, baby eat your Wheaties, girl

[Verse 2: Shawnna]
I know you want me baby, do I make you horny, baby?
I can tell by your eyes, you want me to ride you, like a horsey, baby
Better back up off me, baby, oh, you're not the type to be scurred
If you feel this, we can do it real big, maybe you can meet me in the back of the G4
We can do it in the 'Lac, on the D-low,we can do it on the track for the people
Seen you looking at the ass, we do it for the cash, I throw it like craps at the 'sino
Never had one like me, shorty, when I'm done when the wife is shouting
Maybe thinking that she's like me, but you see, it's just unlikely, shorty
When I get him, I'ma get in the rhythm, and have him feeling like he never ever felt befo'
Get up in him and I fill him with venom, and have him chillin' and drilling me, from the night to the morn'
Baby, you gotta be taking over me, part of me, pardon me, I think he got me in the zone
Love it when he call me on the phone, he never been in love so much, but see the body in a thong
He like to put the nookie in his face, and every time I get out of line, he like to put me in my place
He put me in the A, or should I say the 745, gotta .45 chillin' in the safe
So what'cha wanna say? Your boy wanna see me, trying to meet me 'cause I'm on TV
Better believe I want you, and I'm finna come through, 'cause I ate my Wheaties

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, baby eat your Wheaties, girl

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Since I gotta super label, and
I got a big amount to pay the hand
So can a nigga get a table dance?
You looking hotter than Zatarain's
And I'm thinking of getting laid again
I don't- give a damn about who that belong to
Don't- keep the N9na waiting any longer
Want- to be the lucky one to get up on you
C'mon, shake your booty, baby, do that conga!
You don't wanna miss it, 'cause I'ma hit it terrific and I be so
Rugged, ya love it, I'm cock diesel
Me so horny, but don't be thinking I'm evil
Please your body 'cause baby, it's 'squisito
Don't get it twisted when you get with a nice cat
Give me what you want, because ya know when you like that
But get up in the sack, you won't be able to fight that
Brace for your neck and in the panties, an ice pack
Eat them Wheaties, and really you can get power
Come in and get at you every motherfucking hour
Give you a lot of it, then we get up in the shower
Then hit Roscoe's on Sunset and Gower
I'ma leave for a minute, but I'ma be back
You can videotape it, can't nobody see that
Eat your Wheaties, 'cause everyday I'ma need cat
So if you looking to see me, you better eat that

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
I'm coming to get it just so you know
Ain't no prison in the system that can hold a bro, no
And I'm gon' hit it, like I told you so
Don't be actin' like you forgot it, you're s'posed to know, yo

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, baby eat your Wheaties, girl
Baby, I hope you ate your Wheaties
When you see me, it won't be easy, yeah
Hope your intention ain't to tease me
You wanna please me, baby eat your Wheaties, girl

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, you better eat your Wheaties, baby
And get the big ol' bowl of 'em too: the breakfast of champions
And if you ain't got that get you some Powerade, some Gatorade,  some something-ade
'Cause if you ain't ready I'ma be like: neh'mind
