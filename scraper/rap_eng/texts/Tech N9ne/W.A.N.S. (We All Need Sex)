[Intro]:
Sometimes, there's a man
Sometimes, there's a woman
And sometimes... Now I forgot what I was sayin'
Lets, lets just have sex

[Hook]:
We all need sex
And it's gonna continue
We all need sex
It's just the animal in you

[Verse 1]:
Just rollin' over out of bed
Had to get my head right last night
Can't remember anything I did
Damn it must'a been one of them nights
Got a 50 and a bottle of whiskey
And the sun went down (uh huh)
Think I remember she kissed me
And took a trip downtown
I remember sangin' (what?)

[Hook]:
We all need sex
But you don't love it like I do (I do)
We all need sex
And somebody to lie to (Lie to)
We all need sex
And it's gonna continue (continue)
We all need sex
It's just the animal in you

[Verse 2]:
Just gettin' out of my car
I couldn't believe it's dark
Sometime I gotta put it in park
When it gets dark
Need a [?] and a bottle of whiskey
And the sun went down
Think I remember she kissed me
And took a trip downtown
I remember sangin' (What she sayin'?)

[Hook]

[Bridge]:
If you ever got it in the kitchen
Know how to stop it if she bitchin'
If priests only knew what they was missin'
I remember sayin' that (what?)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Sex, it's what for dinner
Son of Sam
Rock on
