[Hook: Stylez & Joey Cool]
Say she won't get wavy
25, no babies
Good girl on the weekdays
Weekend she go crazy
Hundred on my 50's
Always taking risks
When I pull up in that foreign, watch me take off with your bitch
Nigga, I go, go hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Nigga, I go, go hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Nigga, I go, go hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Nigga, I go, go, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard
Nigga I go

[Verse 1: Joey Cool & JL]
Hey lil nigga, what you drank?
Yellin' "All hail to the swank" (All hail, nigga)
Nigga, we do what you can't (What you can't, nigga)
I'm with JL at the bank
Doing pretty damn good, no complaint (Never that)
These hoes show no restraint (Everywhere we at)
We know that ain't one of them a saint
Only wanna be around the niggas with the rank
I'ma need a  good percentage my nigga, the whole cake
Always had to deal with the pressure but won't break
We gon' do whatever, whatever it's gon' take
This what happens when you ready to do it like all day
Bitch I'm rocking with the killers and spitters who all spray
Get to snapping as if it was an audience of a play
When you be goin' this hard, what are they gon' say?
I been tellin' niggas 'bout it forever, we don't play
Kansas City represented, and the labels a pillar
Nigga, we authentic I'm saying ain't nothing realer
You ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing if you a gritter
Made it out the hood and that's what you gotta remember
Capital D-I-B-K-I-S
With the snake and the B-A-T on my chest
Man I gotta give thanks, I would say that I'm blessed
Got the henny and the stank, got the weed on my breath
Ayy, ayy, ayy, bitch better move to the left (Move over to ya)
Nigga better watch your step (Better watch that)
Don't you play the boy, no Heff (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know we gon' do it to the death (To the death)
Sick with the Pharaoh, no Nef
Lil nigga say it with your chest
I wrote DIBKIS on the wall at Red Rocks, nigga yes
It ain't nothing like we limitless with it, we finna flex
The almighty gang, gang, but what I seen
Out a near nigga, Irish when we fighting
Me and my team bang, bang, fuckin' tight bean
Bugging out like it's Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing"
"The Defiant Ones", Little Giants, Jimmy Iovine
With the icing, and you'd better come and find me
Kush in my lungs, get in my trance
Give me my green, flip the high beam
I'm a wizard with the rhyming

Nigga, I go, go, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard

[Verse 2: Joey Cool & Tech N9ne]
I ain't know it'd be this bad
Dedicating my whole fucking life to killing people
With note pads
You so drag, you're hopeless
Dumping with no blast
Got a couple of killers coming for your ass
And hopefully I'm becoming a known man
'Cause I got a plan, punching the whip but with no gas
I keep on tallying niggas who don't pass through
One hundred in the ally, my nigga, it won't crash
Nigga skrrt
If you gotta warm it, keep it secured
'Cause I'ma dip into her
When I get to rappin', Tech is the cure
To all her ailments, all the bitches be Hell-bent
'Til dove into the deed to get it you can bet they'll sprint
Nigga, where your tail went?
Two elite spitters and he's bitter
'Cause she came and gave us the deep river on cheap liquor
Then hop in the Uber to seek givers
And go, chicken, go, least we can let her eat with us
Niggas' talking down at me, now you honor the Tecca
Anybody hating on us, your momma's a Heffer
Usually I go and get the llama to wet ya
Cut your head off then I say "Wakanda Forever"
