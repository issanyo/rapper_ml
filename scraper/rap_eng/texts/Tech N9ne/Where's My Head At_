[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Tech N9ne and Grewsum
We're not one dimensional
We're three dimensional
You know what I'm sizzling?
We boldly go where no motherfucker would ever go
You know what I'm sizzling?
That's what we do baby
Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Grewsum]
Everybody got a misconception of the shit that I'll be doing
I'm catching the glare out of their eyes when I'll be riding through it
They're hoping I'll fail and maybe die
For rhymes that I'll been spewing
They're sick of wickedness other
Than the business that I'm pursuing
But they can all stare, all day at my ball beard
Because of the way they single me out it's not at all fair
It's because I got a love for violence
And I'll never gave a fuck and I cannot be silenced
Apparently I ain't doing it right
Whenever they hear Grew on a mic
Get's speaking in tongue while I'm sticking my dick in some shit
That's infected but doing it tight
Flipping the rectum just isn't a minute
That's probably something that you really like
I could just give in and live how you live
But me? I'm resistant and choosing to fight
So all of them talking lips, oh God, can all be zipped
I'll show em what darkness is
And welcome em to thee apocalypse
If they wanna bark at this I'm turning em all into carcasses
You represent normal shit, I'll just do me and y'all be sick

[Hook x2: Grewsum]
My wicked shit's a little bit different and I guess that
They're looming at me, but there's not in me against that
Wide eye pondering, why the fuck I just said that?
Looking at me wondering "where the fuck is my head at?"

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
And I ain't ever been treated as an equal
People are lethal, this war prevails around evil
Born different, daddy's sword the liquid down tore
Deliverance found the cord and it's revising war
To Maude Kalifah from its naughty urethra
And that started the creature, but in a heart he's a preacher
So this made me good and the bad due a head-on collision
And this means I'm radical with my ideas and decisions
I don't fit it, cause I don't kiss no ass to get in
But I’m slightly psycho with these rhymes I'm spitting, written
But my appearance, makes it hard for my music
They say it's dark and they choose
To get way apart cause they lose it
Radio wax legal, they say that I'm dope but my raps evil
And say I won't appeal to black people
But I'm a nigga plus a strange nigga
But fame give-a so much pain, feel like they wanna hang me-lla
Fraudulent gangsters thank God that I ain't cha
All you Broads are in danger, I put a Slipknot up and hang ya
Cause it's a sad fact, you amateurs really tryna dead rap
At least in Grewsum and Ninna's head's at

[Hook x2: Grewsum]

[Verse 3: Grewsum]
You see the way I am, but what did you expect from me?
I’m next to SEVEN-X to get my checks, so rest in peace
Oh yes, I recommend you, let me in, now let me speak
I came to set a trend with Tech and nem so let's just see
How far I'm willing to go to get my scrilla or bread stacks
I'm not your average, where is my cabbage on my head at
Who's like a savage, it's established you's against that
Then let’s attack ‘em, body bag 'em to contest that
Get on a level with devilish mind
Check em and wreck em attack em with N9ne
Yes I dissect them and sever their spine
Just to protect what I said in my rhymes
Stop! Midwest invasion, of the best you best to praise em
Better get with the next sensation
Better yet, what you said meant Nathan
To me or anyone that I've ever met with a hot spit
You want me hate, what you can't be, because you not shit
So keep that no sense, to yourself or get bomb threads
Step on the way where your grandmoms at
Homie I know that you cause that

[Hook x2: Grewsum]
