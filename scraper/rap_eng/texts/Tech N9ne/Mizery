[Intro]
From the beginning, nigga
It's all Jesus, yeah
Tech N9ne! And my nigga Macc James
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh
Straight bringin' that mizery, mizery, mizery

[Hook: Macc James & Tech N9ne]
Mizery when I see enemies, niggas be (?)
Homicidal tendencies got Mitch Bade niggas on bended knees
Could it be that a nigga wanna bang
Cause I'm runnin' with the gang
That'll give a nigga pain me and Macc James
Givin' these bitch niggas a taste of mizery
Give 'em mizery (Ry) bitches get with me (Me)
Got my nigga M-A-C (C), gonna bring 'em mizery (Ry)
Give 'em mizery (Ry), bitches get with me (Me)
Got my nigga M-A-C (C), gonna bring 'em mizery (Ry)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I'm high, y'all drunk, I love bud
'Bout to hit 'em with another hit up
Out of the Mizery nigga nigga what
My murderous niggas heard of this verb
That I serve in this sh-shit
I shits word into the curb with this tihs kcuf
Mystic, might be twisted but bitch we got the shit gifted
Mizery nigga, so what you givin' me nigga
Nothin' but witchery nigga, millimeter's the killer
Bow down to a nigga right now for the sound, hold up
Nigga came to the club and he found us
Up behind a nigga back tryin' to bound us
I don't want that nigga Vell up around us
You the Holy Temple bandit, nigga I'm a killer on candy
Tecca Nina I'mma be the omega believe I'm that
Bomb that landed on your set cause you call me Satan
When I look at you I see skull chips dipped
In ranch dressing lemon chicken with a side of intestines
Induced vomiting backwards digestion
Torn ligaments with Ragu, garlic salt's meshin'
Enormous hole in the ozone to affect my complexion'
Frontal lobes fried in Wesson
Nigga like me sick no need for no medicine
Bishop and Keen (What)
You better believe you gotta leave
Before you get a couple in your belly
Keena better strip in a whole another city
Bishop keep doing songs with R. Kelly
Mentally you niggas can't even get with me
I done lost everything but my chemistry
Macc and Tech we be hotter than hickory
Killin' delivery, livin' in mizery

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Macc James]
KC Mizery, leave unsolved mysteries
For fuckin' round with my cheddar cheese
Betta leave these G's alone
Before me and my nigga Tech Nina
Hit your home, split your dome
With the 4 chrome, make a nigga face melt like the ozone
In the mind of a psycho, what goes on?
Colombian necktie with no clothes on
Murder show's on, in the K-Town
I'm the type of nigga that'll beat your ass down
Shoot you in the face as soon as you hit the ground
Hit a nigga, split a nigga, then give you a pound
32 rounds, packin' extended's
Crossin' my niggas is not recommended
Tempted to put you in a life long body cast
You best guard your shit when the shotty blast
More straps than John Gotti had
So sick I sleep in a body bag
Droppin' bombs like Saudi
Had to get low in a Lac on faulty tags
Talkin' trash'll get you took out
Four niggas posted just to look out
Get grips like fierce and have a cook out
Let me show you niggas what me and the crooks 'bout
Thievin', schemin', seein' demons
Smoke so much you kill your semen
Psychoactive human being
Eyes so low I look Korean
Head steamin', funk bringin'
Old school rider gangsta leanin'
James and Tech N9ne tag teamin'
Leavin' all you fags bleedin'

[Hook]
