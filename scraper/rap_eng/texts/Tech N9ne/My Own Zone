[Intro: Tech N9ne]
When opinions from your peers suck
And know we ain't about tears much
With no fear tucked, we just tell 'em what!

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
They say Tech lost it, Tech's frosted
And that's exactly what you find up under Tech faux shit
Put a X cross it cause Tech bosses
And you'll concur if ever you took a pic of Tech's office
Said demons trying to fly
But they cannot reach us because we too high in the sky
Only time we see you slam this is when we transmit
From our planet to get your evil language and shit
Ain't no best lives for you to break up
Tech N9ne's a Gouda maker
With the cabbage I turnip and ya know that set lies in a rutabaga
I blew the place up
Flowing for freedom for real and you the faker my buddha blaze up and my choppin' is in a shoota's nature aye
I'll forever make you shuffle your feet, buckle the weak step into me
I'll give you knuckles to eat aye
In my zone until I see it's trouble ya seek
Knock out a couple of teeth that's a couple's retreat
Yeah

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

[Verse 2: Futuristic]
Own zone, own both homes
Those clones follow me down the road like Todo
Cold flow, kick in the door and let my dough grow
Made a track with Tech, here's another, plus we got four more
More shows' my mojo
Make the people so glow
Everything is fast, I remember when it was slow mo'
If they talking 'bout me it's cause they gotta be insecure up in their own woes
Got iconic songs for the stoned folks and the funny thing is I don't smoke
No phones man, I'm off of the web
I'm where my people giving arm and a leg
Okay the bar has been set
I'm independent, ain't no clause in my check
I had to get it, then I got it, that's the cause and effect
I garner respect, I don't let no one cause me distress
The scars in my flesh is symbols of how hard it can get
The talking is less, I pause 'em when they call and collect
They all get upset, they hating and I'm onto the next

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
Sparks of motivation, I'm circulating the product
Glad that we made it, I love that the struggle taught us
I'm bossing up and I'm bothered, they never bought us
Never get left behind, I remember the days
I used to tell them suckas never mind
You get your piece of the pie and bro better step aside
Bottom line we invested, never give up
You won't know if you never try
You'll even start to regret it, cause you get better with time
Just look at Tech, lookin' at me like he ain't never lied
Overtime, gotta show these suckas how you really move
I'm a committed dude that's how I know the journey will improve
Check it
I get to traveling do what niggas would kill to do
Will of man, I could've sold my soul, I wasn't willing to
The shit I battle with most deal with
My door open if you both get lit
Go on tours, in the back room with my baby mama's grocery list
In my own zone if I ain't a legend yet then I'm close to it
Tell 'em I'm ready, forever grateful, I could've gave up
But they wouldn't let me, the people need me
I know I'm edgy but

[Chorus: Tech N9ne & Krizz Kaliko]
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
I don't care I'm in my own zone
I won't spare not nere, I'm gon' blown
