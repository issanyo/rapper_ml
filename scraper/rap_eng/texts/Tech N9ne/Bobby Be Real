[Intro: Slaine]
Tell them motherfuckers to shut the fuck up in the background!
There's a new song and dance going on!

[Verse 1: Slaine]
Up in the MGM Grand with 10 Gs in his hand
Coked out, drinkin', thinkin' of the reasons he’s planned
For shit to get hot as the summer 'til it’s freezin' again
Bullets pop off, hit you like it’s grease from the pan
Man, he don’t he believe in the law
Is it all regards? Demons 'n lords
Stackin' up paper, schemin' the broads
What's his name, is it Steven or George?
Half of the time, that’s where the crime is
Kids, he’s been involved
Scare bids, even it off
Divas got his evening revolving
Not even the problem, the meanest of all
But the semen's evolved to get his penis and balls in
Lisa and all, who’s a piece of shit whore
With some creaks in her jaw that squeaks like a dolphin
He don’t even do drugs, he’s getting off 'em
He crashes into a wall, crawls in the coffin

[Hook: Slaine]
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I told 'em before you go to pack a Jimmy
With a Jammy, 'cause who you like is pokin' Minnie
She's open like Cedars, Mickey D's and Denny's
He never listen, so we don't take any
Hopped on the bitch naked, when she got the clapper
Somebody was at the door, they came to jack her
Broke in the crib, every one of em got the strappers
But Bobby done brung nothing but his dirty dagger
Psycho shooters came and plotted the ho
Seen a sucka so they shot at the bro
They want Bobby straight demolished, abolished
And then they caught it, I woulda brought in the fo
The family’s all blood
Sick as hell 'cause something raw called
I was one of the friends at Bobby’s funeral like “oh no!”

[Hook: Slaine]
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)

[Verse 3: Madchild]
I got a problem
I think that probably my kemosabe’s actually Bobby
Five in the morning, down in the lobby
Drunk but on coke so he’s not even wobbly
He got his problems, hope he can solve 'em
Talking to bitches that look like a goblin
He’s doing coke and he think that she’s dope
But her feet are as big as a couple toboggans
Once every month or so, quits and goes joggin'
Knowing there’s something that’s wrong with his noggin
Spends all his money and drives a jalopy
Actin's his passion and rap is his hobby
Smashin' and bashin', his fashion is sloppy
Laughin' and lashin' out, actin' up oddly
He’s got a crew, and when they all start mobbin'
That’s when my brother Slaine turns into Bobby

[Hook: Slaine]
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)
Bobby be real (Bobby be real)
They told him "Bobby be real" ("Bobby be real")
They said life isn't easy
Keep holding on to that wobbly wheel
(Hold on that wobbly wheel ohh)
