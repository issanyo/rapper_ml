[Verse 1: J.L.]
Uh, who do I trust?
Niggas vindictive and women are full of lust
I ain't got the time to be wasting
Get the fuck out my face with the flaky fakeness, don't front
Ain't no reason for you to be around me so what you want?
You waitin' for them to crown me so you can bring me down
But I'm up on you niggas now you bout to be lookin' stuck
Follow me into the slaughterhouse and watch a nigga get cut
I could be put away for the weaponry that I'm keepin' tucked
My music is a drug, I make them feel like cluck
It is a legal substance but there is not a sub-stitute
In pursuit, salute the ones that love me I'm still
Doing it major without a deal do some work
And believe in it ain't no problem making skrill
Especially when you grinding and you deliver skill
Fully wit me, just want you to keep it real

[Hook: J.L.] (2X)
Don't say you love me
And turn around and talk behind my back
Hating on me when I'm not in the vicinity
Like I'm an enemy, why you wanna do me like that?
Don't say you love me
But try to play me like a fool, not cool
Anybody can put up a front
People can do what they want to
But really if you ain't being true
Don't say you love me

[Verse 2: J.L.]
When really I know that you want my paper
You see the ambition, and you envisionin' me a savior
Like sitting on the bench and you never have been a player
But want a championship, shit, you is a trader
I just peep em out and I blow my smoke in the air
You ain't bout the love I can see through your jealous nature
Decepticon bitches, I know that nothin' can change her
Wanna have a baby to lock you a nigga in
18+, you tryna live off of him
Deceive him, trick him into believing ya friend
And just as soon as ya dude leave you in sin
Need to be held accountable for the deeds you commit
She devil, insist, she innocent, got me bent
She will attempt, to tempt, anyone gettin' grip
Tryna find you somebody that'll be willing to pay ya rent
Not a cent will be given, a fuck won't either
If you got a good women, better go head, keep her
No sucker on my forehead, let no skeezer
Be my downfall, fight southpaw, on y'all creatures
Succubus chick, look bitch, you too eager
Think you got a problem that could be a little deeper
It don't take a genius to see that you is a creeper
Devil in a dress, ya box hot as a fever
You be hoping on multiple dicks, no breather
Zoo said the ho is an animal, don't feed her
Vi said he cannot be kickin' it with a clinger
I say the scent of a sinner is gonna linger
The center of attention, bribe you with the beaver
Understand the plan of a damn man-eater
Get away if you can, man, you don't need her
But don't blame her, she's a dreamer

[Hook: J.L.] (2X)
Don't say you love me
And turn around and talk behind my back
Hating on me when I'm not in the vicinity
Like I'm an enemy, why you wanna do me like that?
Don't say you love me
But try to play me like a fool, not cool
Anybody can put up a front
People can do what they want to
But really if you ain't being true
Don't say you love me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Nigga-itis shouldn't be whatcha get from eating
But demons sucking the jellysickles sicker than bronchitis
Dick up a bung pirate, hit tip of tongue privates
Lick up til they hiccup, wanna be picked up and hung by it
This all becomes violent, get up and run, hide
A zippity lip this'll become highlands, tyrant
Somebody beat up a naysayer, cause they player
Dirty game I heat up and spray they'll, be laid there
When I give you these, big trigga please
Betta get epiphanies quickly I be little chickadees and stay scared
I'm stopping a killer with tres layers, I melee her
Be made prayer with the laid hair, I fray play up
Stray out the way they have decay, fate is displayed
Blade at bay, and it fazed and Haterade, ay-yah
They be wondering why we on shit, leave me alone
It's because people be coming wrong, this evil is gongish
Strongish, shown it's, moments of greed
It take a nigga dumb up in his dome not to believe
If they love you for the minute
Then when they get inside it, they get grim and bite it
Doin' everything that's not for despited
Wanna be wicked and die, bitch, look in my iris
You can choke on the head of my dick (yeah, you can suck me)
On second thought, you can't even do that (cause you too ugly)
And try to say Tecca Nina shit whack (when Iâ€™m rough as rugby)
That's why you haters wanna hit me with a gat (but you can't plug me)
So JL, what's the name of this track?

[Hook: J.L.] (2X)
