[Intro: Nachia Woodley]
I just want a one night stand

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Peep me, uh
I rock and Nina while I get cleaner with pieces I purchase
More glitz and ritz than Versace
No first base, I'm hittin' homers, put groupies in what?
Comas, with a hella boner minus condyloma
When rollin' Sunset or Prospect
We on the lookout for some hot sex on a platter
Who we rock next don't matter, pay attention
You friends say I'm a no hit
But did you know my oral is in ten different posit's?
[?] one nihzizzy
Sprung from smelling my Issey Miyake
The suns of bizzy when I gun you dizzy
Ride you like Kawasaki
So if you don't try to stop me
You'll have a night of yellin' Bonsai like Mr. Miyagi
Where's the party? (not my place) I belong to somebody
Why am I spittin' 'cause I'm naughty-naughty
Scorpio we slick as ice hockey
When I'm bombin' like a Shockley
We rock these socks of Ewoks
One night nooks, N9na's off the hook

[Chorus: Nachia Woodley]
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

[Intermixed with Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Ha ha ha ha
I know what you want baby, and I'll tell ya again
It's all delicious, we kick it, whatever you want to do, you down?
You down for a one night stand?  I told you that
I had somebody, I had to be real up front
[?] we can do this

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Girl what's happenin' wit' ya?
Lose the Mitchell if he trippin' I'ma take his picture
You make me sizzle gots to get ya, what's the deal homie?
If you're real lonely, let me spank it but don't do an Anita Hill on me
Awful to scare a homie with a lawful ceremony
Demi Moore, Disclosure
In the pen yellin' "I miss dosia"
All because of one night, but if you woulda gave me the chance
It would've been done right
I would've made the nana sneeze, gesundheit
Will ya over?  We just met but I can soak ya
Strip poker, unsober, got us tossin' on the sofa
You saw me starin' at you, when ya done ah-carin'
That you never ever climaxed, inside the IMAX
My one night stand can make you call the Sandman
Sprung over the first name of the host of American Bandstand
I heard you say you ain't gon' even call me
That's how it is in showbiz it's in the Bible
Don't ya think?  Though it is bitch

[Chorus: Nachia Woodley]
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

[Intermixed with Chorus: Tech N9ne]
[?] you can't buy this shit from me
It's all delicious, that's how we do it
I mean, it was passed down to my father from his father, passed down to my father and his father and ah, my father passed it down to me.  How we do this player shit
Like, can I sing to you for a second?

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
The scene is green exposure
The club is filled with dosia
What I'm about to recruit
Partner picture had the hunter in the private school suit
I seen her peepin' me and since there ain't no type of geek in me
I made my way to the specimen, stressin' it's the freak in me
So I shifted into Barry White mode
The closer that I got homie, the more she was cold
She had a trunk load, I walked up on her like dwam
The record said start, she grabbed me and said that's my jam
You know you gets the nookie after a Luke song
You take the hooch home, so you can get your shoots on
I wanna take you out your normal state of mind lady love
And if they shoot us, they just takin' us out this land of Judas
We can ride the ninth cloud, and seventh heaven then land right
On my mattress and drop you after one night, Beatrice

[Chorus: Nachia Woodley]
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

[Intermixed with Chorus: Tech N9ne]
What'cha mean?  It ain't cruel?  Y'all do it too
You can't tell me you ain't never met no nigga that you just wanted to...you met at the club and you just wanted to, you know, take him home after y'all got done drinkin' a couple of Caribou Lous.  Ya know what I mean?
Do what you came to do to the nigga, ya know what I mean?
We do it every day, you do it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Y'all keep it, at the club and y'all got a good way of keepin' that shit hidden.  You know what I'm sayin'?  Y'all ain't right

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I'm short, dark and rugged, and lots of ladies love it
When I covet any object with fur I gots to rub it
I'm mister rapper man, Dapper Dan who's bad
Now they know me when see me in the brand new Jag
Pullin' up on the club scene, you and homegirl's gaze
Heard the N9na flips the tongue in many ways, plus he paid
A super freak, so for the tongue they got to seek
So they come and get a piece of N9na but they fall in love a little when they peak
On the [?] human hydraulics excites me, hypes me psyche
Tonight I hope I'll be the victor like Nike
I'm poured and now we Motel 6'n liked it, bashed it
Later found out she burns through Jimmys, nitric acid
I fasted on one nights for a split
I'm back and now the Tech is highly hated by the Mitch clique
If you get it Mitch like bitch quick you hitched
But yo if you's a one night stander throw your hands in the air like this

[Chorus: Nachia Woodley]
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you be my man? (one night)
One night stand (one night)
Why can't you understand?

[Intermixed with Chorus: Tech N9ne, woman]
You agreed to do it with me, but now, after we get through it, you actin' like, you know what I'm sayin', that I did something bad to you, that ain't right.  You know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, that's what I said, know what I'm sayin'?  I mean, you said, I told you in the beginning that, you know what I'm sayin', I was with a mothafucka, but, you know what I'm sayin', you said it was cool, you know what I'm sayin', but now you're lookin' at me like, you know what I'm sayin', like everything ain't right, so it's...
Uh, what the, where y'all?
Want to [?] my pajamas?
I have to think about that
Would you do that for me?
I can do that
If you do, we can start with some, Caribou Lou
Ooh, that sounds good
Get blowed
Higher than a mother fucker
Get fucked up
Real fucked up and it's all delicious
