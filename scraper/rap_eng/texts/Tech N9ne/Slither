[Tech N9ne Talking]
A stallion
Ass like pow
Chest like bang
Lips like ooh
An angel, mane
But she had the devil's eyes
I had to have her cat

[Verse 1]
Pass me the 151 and coke cat
And later we'll find where the dope at
But hold that
I seen something so fat
That wish I could've drove back
To get my Kodak
Strip teeasa!
Loving who got the VISA
Got it and she will please ya
Nada then she don't need ya
Prada Gucci Felecia
It's a duty to feed ya
Amnesia
Caribou and tequezia
Off the turnbuckle baby bubba had the booty and boobies
It was nootie so cootie was a cutey
I gotta get neara
I got mucho dinero
Look at her look at herself in the mirror
Moving like Shakira
Made my way
To the front of the stage
100's for days
Big body I wanted to praise
Will she get with a nigga? maybe!
She bent over and said thanks and I whispered in her ear

[Hook x2]
Tech: I love the way you make it slither baby
Every night when I come through
That looks like something that I want to run through
Girl: You want some, ooh
Tech: You know I want to
Girl: Baby we can have fun too (I love the way you make it slither baby)

[Verse 2]
Well she asked me for a lap dance
And Trav said she too fine, fat chance
Boy I'm Tech N9ne I rap and
I slap hands
With millionaires plus I got stacks man
She approached me slowly
Holy moly
Chef Boy R Dee's cheese and beef ravioli
Hold me close
Nose be ope
How much evil can dough provoke
How much she told me nope
Cause this one was on her
I'm hoping I can get the chance to put it on her
She slithered on me put the booty in my lap and got to gyrating
Was I waiting
For the pushing grabbing and vibrating
But this is really when my pupils got to dilating
What kind of magical hocus pocus was I facing
Over and over I tried to explain it the best that I could
She put the mouth on the crotch of my pants and said (HERRRRRH)

Tech: Shit
Girl: you like that baby?
Tech: How about me and you leave here baby so we can do that shit you just did
Over and over again

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Said she needed 400 to tip out
I whip out
The grip so quick so we can dip out
The trick house
Told my homies not to poke they lip out
I'm going to rip out
The guts and try to throw my hip out
Now it's time to trip out
Got at the bitch house
Was three fine female roommates my homies missed out
Took me to her room and threw me right on the bed
Got right on the head
What a wonderful night it was said
Then along came 3
36 double D's
Sizes kissing and licking on me
They coming to do what
Wake my dude up
But one of them bitches bit me on the neck and drew blood
Then the other and the others
Instead of bud lovers
I'm trapped with blood sucking motherfuckers for eternity
Brought me here to straight feed on a nigga
All because I said to a stripper
(I love the way you make it....Slithaaaaaa!)
