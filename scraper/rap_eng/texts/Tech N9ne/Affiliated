[Tech N9ne]
I walk with a limp, cause my dick is massive
Bitches know when they see me better switch they masses
I love it when they be rockin them Gucci glasses
Synapsis, I'm bout to hit it then dash and crash it
When I'm in Vegas you haters be rockin them gators
Cad daddy get up you with the playas and waitin in line
We pull up faded, and no latest, affordin Jordans
Lookin important, guess we never fakin in rhyme
Fuck them niggas, I'm bout to get my Dragon in shelter
Millions of people give money, we tourin Astraulia
New Zealand bitches love me, how many times can I tell ya
That I'm the schei√üe, them other niggas is failures
San Quinn, we lovin this, with tracks we tough
When demons combat you trippin yo we bust enough
Rounds to lay em down, we done deal in Strange
And the back of my land, that babe she give us skull in a range

Affiliated, they really hate it
We participate it, conversate it
To the grind, goin hard, cause we obligated
Then we brought the game back when we operate it
Being real cats mean
You should celebrate it
Affiliated, they really hate it
We participate it, conversate it
To the grind, goin hard, cause we obligated
Then we brought the game back when we operate it
Being real cats mean
