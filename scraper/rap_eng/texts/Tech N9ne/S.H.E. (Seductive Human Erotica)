[Verse 1]
I ain't never paid no chick to thrust
Me, I never paid no woman to make me bust
Me, I never needed no other chick to clutch
'Cause N9na was knowing holy matrimony it's a must
Never ever paid and came with lust
My aims for trust
Because my woman's pain is enough
Don't want my marriage ending strange and abrupt
But just here recently my brains corrupt
One night my niggas took me to the strip club Bazooka's
Everybody knows that's not the type of shit I'm used to
It's a juicer, so that means there was no clothes
Got my eyes open wide like I'm on no dose
Look at these bozos, givin' double 0's for ho shows
I was cool
I was drinking my juice I was never really in the mood
Until I was approached by a beautiful angel in the nude
But I flipped my top
When she sat that butter skin on my lap I was shocked
Lips locked feeling like my heart stopped
She was hot!
She was Carmen Electra in the chest
Aaliyah by the waist
Jennifer Lopez in the ass
But she was an angel in the face
She asked me if I wanted to dance on the couch
With the look of a zombie I reached into my pouch
And shelled it out
Then she took me by the hand and lead me to the land
Where a man could forget about all his problems at hand
The scent of a woman, she wearing Chanel
Hypnotized by the smell, a glimpse of hell
And bodily melt down is what I felt now
I came with 500 tryin' to keep it all but she want it
At the ATM to get 4 more that's the limit the UMB Bank let go
Heavenly can't describe this woman beyond that
Our pelvic area steady bumping and grinding in combat
No penetration, no touchin' it's funny
How she didn't kiss me and didn't fuck me
But still got away with all of my money
S.H.E

[Hook]
Took everything that I had
Fiending for the sex hella bad!
Took everything that I had
Fiending for the sex hella bad!

[Verse 2]
The next day my wife's checking the account
She said your only bringing four thousand a month
So last night you spent damn near one thousand on what?
A new piece of equipment for the studio
She'll never really ever truly know
That I spent it all on a nudie show
I close myself in the bathroom
Lean over the stool and grabbed my middle section tight
Thinking about the way she made me feel that night
I had a lot of fun
Then I got one, then I got one
I want back that life, in the next life, but did I come
Wife pissed because I depleted our funds
She left me and moved back with her mom
I'm borrowing money from all my homies
I knew it was wrong
But this bitch was the bomb
I'm paying the bills at Bazooka's
I slip my finger through her g-string, it was tight
She told the bouncers, now I'm in a fist fight
You put me out I thought you loved me
You said that you liked it rough like me
All these motherfuckers and your man
Can't love you enough like me
I lost my life for you, my wife for you
I miss you so I'm sitting outside the club every night for you
Got spite for you
S.H.E
