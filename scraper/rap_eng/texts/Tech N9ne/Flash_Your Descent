[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Show day is stressful, everybody wanna call, gotta tell 'em no
Sometimes, sit up in a record store 700 fans, man, everyone signed
And it get so hard tellin' 'em all please try to form one line
With the player haters combined, I don't think you know
How much of a strain it's been, I can't explain, it's insane
But I wouldn't give up a thang, I live with the pain and resort to brain trippin'
I need a little release, somethin' to stop my rage
I really need me a moment of peace, so baby girl when I step on stage

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
Flash! Like it's Mardi Gras
Flash! Girl, take off your bra
Flash! Talkin' to all of y'all
Flash! This is a party call
Flash! This song ain't about your
Ass! But I really love it when you
Pass! If you're with me can we
Smash! My baby doll!
Flash! Like it's Mardi Gras
Flash! Girl, take off your bra
Flash! Talkin' to all of y'all
Flash! This is a party call
Flash! This song ain't about your
Ass! But I really love it when you
Pass! If you're with me can we
Smash! My baby doll!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I really love it (Really love it)
I can see them from the front row to the back
And it's beautiful, I've imagined this
Since I was a youth, now that I'm, old enough
Girls that are, swoll enough: Grab your shirt, roll it up
Even if you a A cup girl we can still play touch
If you a B and C cup, girl, I bet you can make me erupt
D cups, be the ones that are driving me nuts
Big breast never trouble me, if you packin' a double D
Let everyone S-double-E
Angelina Jolie let me see those
Beautiful babies, I'm all about the tito's
Ms. Jackson packin' 'em wholly Toledos
Missed the flash 'cause I didn't have Tivo
Ask me who's fire, playa, I'ma yell Tyra
Little sick in the head, still got the magazine of Elvira
Life is so grand, when you got yo fans
Bastin' out their shirts, flashin' their Lindsey Lohans
I got a pocket full of Trojans
We can all get nasty if you flash me, baby, you know the program

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Girls in the back, come to the front, 'cause we in need of cleavage
And I've been lookin' at you, you and yo homegirl
Let me see both of them, now grab a hold of them
Look what you doin' to me, now grab a hold him

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Haha, such an odd sensation, you know the dogs been waitin'
For you to quickly take off your Vicky and show me your augmentation
Silicon or saline, either way puts me in a daydream
Talkin' 'bout it gets me way steamed, baby girl this Regime
When you see me, baby, lift it up, thinkin' I'ma miss it, nigga, what?
If I miss one; back it up "Stit elur eht dlrow"
Tig old bitties lady, from city to city crazy
Here's your instructions: Show me them titties baby!

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Traveling for miles and miles
Girls gone wild love this peculiar style
So in order for us to get our heads right
We all need you ladies, to turn on your headlights
Flash!
