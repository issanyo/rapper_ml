[Intro: Futuristic]
Sheesh (yeah)

[Chorus: Futuristic]
Yeah, all you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yeah, everybody wanna run they mouth
Tellin' hella stories 'bout the things they did
Pull up on 'em
I'll show opponents, I'll son a nigga like I raise a kid
Only speak about it if I be about it
We can see about it, make it quick
When it come to spittin', who the fuck you kiddin'?
Y'all ain't never did it like I did
Internet had made me rich
I'm gettin' richer, takin' pictures with some women
Admit it, this life is different, you don't get it
Every sentence killin', make a couple million then quit it
Got niggas in Tempe tryin' to get it
The life of Futuristic, I can give it to 'em
Put a rapper on the team, take 'em on tour
Now he really into somethin'
I been 'round the globe a couple times
I ain't have to sign but it's still an option
Got a lotta guala, made a lotta dollars
Own a lot of land, Davy Crockett
Got your girlie on the tour bus
She don't watch Barney but ya baby boppin'
Hit it, then I get up on the road
I'ma do my dance like it's Sadie Hawkins
Boy, I got the sauce (that's true)
Bitch, I'm living proof (hey)
Tie ya tennis shoes (you trippin')
I ain't in the mood, nah
Y'all ain't really 'bout this life
Took a couple notes from Tech N9ne
Young nigga got the best rhymes
Don't run your mouth, let's ride
Spit it like the cinnamon challenge
I was the kid with the talent
Now I can pick up the balance when I go out
Spittin' fire like a cigarette lighter
Got a girlie gettin' excited
Want me to get up inside it then I gotta bounce
Got six businesses, two houses
Mormon life, a few spouses
A cool accountant, still gettin' bigger
Ain't a damn thing you can do about it, I'm gone

[Chorus: Futuristic]
Yeah, all you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life

[Post-Chorus: Futuristic]
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
You ain't really 'bout that life

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Talkin' about it or bein' about it or what
They don't be havin' what Ninna got down in the gut
They be the people that talk up a lot of BS
And it really gotta be less
I can never shout it enough
Frickin' incredible his art be
Rippin' the level, the kids heart me
Givin' the nation a big dark spree
When I make the music Biz Markie
Innovator, I am not a criminal
This why they women want a shot at genitals
A maximum, they sayin' I'm the minimal
But talk is cheaper than a Dollar General
Haters hearin' me spit it, shitted
Go on ahead and admit it, quit it
Stay stalkin', they talkin'
Tellin' the people that I'm wicked, wicked
Fat stacks, we ballin'
That snatch be callin'
Rap after me, that's actually wack, that's why he stallin'
Rule is ride or get hurt, ain't it?
Dudes a rider since birth, tainted
True the lies'll get worse
Alive or get murked, arrive with his shirt, painted
They don't know that when the Planet drop
I'm 'bout to take the rappin' to a colder degree
Everything I ever wanted from the record business
They gon' hand it over to me
They gonna really see the soul of a G
Riot rider with the flow of the sea
Everybody want the musical virus
I give it to 'em like Ebola disease
I'm on a mission to get fit
Sharpen up enough and I rip it, you get slit
Anybody wanna become a goner, you come on and give me drama
Ate it Fa actin' a big bitch
Try to rap me, I'm the pappy, why you tacky?
'Cause you never knew a demon inside a blacky
And never knew you're fuckin' with a fly Iraqi
Deep in America, anyone would die to trap me
Tech-a, N9n-a, Futur-istic, we are goin' more crazy!
Takin' everybody's money, even takin' your lady!
Makin' movies with her like I'm motherfuckin' Scorsese!
This is dedicated to my homie up in Florida
Rest in peace WarBaby, let's go!

[Chorus: Futuristic]
Yeah, all you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
All you do is talk, talk, talk
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life
You ain't really 'bout that life

[Verse 3: Devvon Terrell]
Fuck up out my way, yeah
I don't play it safe, yeah
When you from the bottom, you hit harder like a bass
They don't wanna see me on top though
Magic on me like Lonzo
I'ma level up, it's so exciting
They don't understand me like I'm Mike Tyson
Haters, I need you, I think that I like it
Feedin' me motivation with a diet
I'ma keep grinding, continue to eat
Think you a boss and I'm takin' a knee
Know that you scared 'cause you are what you eat
Chargin' up, man, I'm gon' need a receipt
Niggas be thinkin' I'm softer than Disney
But then they show up and it's Beauty and Beast
Think that you know me just 'cause my exterior
I am the weirdo and I am superior
Funny how niggas be ringing your line
When you on the rise and I'm like, "One at a time"
Niggas is actors, remember your lines
I seen this movie like 300 times
Kickin' you off of my mountain, it's mine
I just want everybody to know (whoa)
We not goin' away (yeah)
You donâ€™t know your place (yeah)
Knocking at my door, I'm like "Hello" (yeah)
Won't leave me alone (yeah)
I am on the phone (yeah)
Leave a message when you hear the tone
Hold up
If you wanna get it, then you get it
I'm playin' all the position like I'm Kobe, like I'm Shaq
I'm like Kyrie Irving, I'm dishing anybody
Mess with Futuristic, then they get the business
Don't do that
Think you messin' with us but it's too late
You not on our level, nigga, please just tie your shoelace
You trippin'
