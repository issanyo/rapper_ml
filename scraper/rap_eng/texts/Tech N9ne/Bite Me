[Intro: Tech N9ne & Jessica Slankard]
You feel it? (Awww, yeah)
(Bite me, harder, harder, harder!)
Grr.. Grr.. Grrr

[Verse: Tech N9ne]
She don't even know, the lil' mean girl
Get carried away and bite her to let her blood stream flow
Accidentally leave her cold el ni√±o
Pinot noir gushing out of this teen ho
At 19 shouldn't be so damn freaky
But they on it and they want it
Hit them split then leave 'em leaky
But this particular chick poonani's thick and beefy
Rich and seepy, oh yes I have a female animal beneath me
She all in it then she told a nigga to bite her neck
I'm excited cause the gush will give my nut the right effect
But where will I hide a set of double D's
It I try to get her jugular open, I'm gonna keep with the pokin'
Have to really be strokin' her all night, I'm wet
Sunk my teeth in, bitches in heat send me over the top they get hot
Then I gotta bring the beast in
She knows not what she ask or what this night be
This might be the day that she die cause she told an animal to..

[Hook: Jessica Slankard] (2X)
Bite me, excite me
Just bite me, not lightly
I hope the scar is forever, baby I'm getting wetter
The harder, the better!
