[Intro]
From the depths of Misery I stood th-there, now and forever
Exodus, insanus, nocturnus

[Verse 1]
Alucard when I'm on stage
Alucard in the booth when I'm loose and see no days
When it's too right I be rippin' the mic everyday
And every night a nigga won't lay down for no one, towns'll go from
Down under surround the globe to flow some
Timeless lyrics, I'm that spirit that keep it young but the old one
Handle my business, other rappers have no stamina in this
They be livin' glits and glam and they finish
But I've been in it since the man did begin it, will be 'til they end this shit
But why is the Nina so intricate? And his life is seeming so infinite
They call him a demon when he steadily feedin' the need'n be keepin' it limitless
I was back in the days when the rappin' amazed
Everybody wanna rap at the waves
A lot of the rappers up from the passin' away
But I was there and nigga, I'm still here, the killa that been feared
For livin' in them years and leavin' 'em in tears
Hella fast when he say, the lyrical lash and with a passion he spray
Alucard in your dreams, everlasting life ain't hard as it seems
Part of the thing, rapper eatin' rappers up
If you step you gon' start a machine
Losing so many lives, all alone in the skies
I've been livin' so long and this music was still goin' through it
Seen so many die

[Hook] (2X)
Alucard everlasting, timeless bars when I'm rapping
All these stars never last yet I will still stand while everyone's passing

[Verse 2]
Been around for the rise and fall of many, it's plenty of y'all
They was in the game heavy involved, now you ain't livin' at all
A lot of these people looked dead at me, then I knew it would be the heridity
Never credited me now they wanna know the secret to my longevity
I think it's in my blood, my scent begins to flood
Everybody on the planet understand it, I give them a drug
And I get no rest time until it's set shines
I say it's Alucard, you call it Tech N9ne!
By now you know I'm more than just a rapper
I will be now and yes I will be after
I am older than fucking ghetto blasters
But they wonder why youngsters love me, label me master
I am faster than all of you bastards
Livin' at the bottom, I got up and then
I brought 'em a bullet from a gun, I'mma long laster
Now you ask for explanation, my last word
A-L-U-C-A-R-D, read it backwards

[Hook] (2X)

[Outro]
Alucard everlasting
Still frying while watching their demise
Yet, I am not, the only one, of my kind
Ice Cube is one of us
Snoop Dogg is one of us
Busta Bus' is one of us
Nasty Nas is one of us
40 water (E-40), one of us
Scarface, one of us
Jay-Z, one of us
Dr. Dre, one of us
OutKast, one of us
Uncle Luke, one of us
