[Intro: DJ Kay Slay]
It's DJ Kay Slay the drama king
And this is what happens when you put 3 lyricists on one record
That's right, I said lyricists, not rappers
And for you haters out there, pay attention

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
(Jealousy's a motherfucker) Better go
You don't want no problem, you don't wanna mess with it
How I put it down then make 'em come around, niggas already be knowing how I be the best with it
How I step all up in the spot every time you see a nigga fresh step with a little fresh fitted
Bust every bottle in the building and I fuck shit up
I got 'em whilin' till a nigga know he finished
(You weak jealous motherfuckers) You see them gather closer
Pretty white bitches be linin' up like bricks of coca
Make it bounce, stretch and spread yo' ass, yoga
Bangin' on niggas untill we probably break a shoulder
I don't ever give a fuck what it cost, see, the money I'ma toss
Make way homie, see we coming through a little bit
Illiterate, but you know you fuckin' with a boss
Yeah we takin' all the small countries where they don't know us like "Yo, who that?"
While we go and hit 'em with the shit that make 'em wanna raise up, uh-uh, don't do that
Tired of telling niggas when you know exactly what I'm on
Get this bread, bakery, cake up little nigga then I'm gone
Y'all see the way we gotta black out every time I beat 'em in the head till the nigga run along like balalala

[Chorus: MeetSims]
You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up [?] jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow
You can lose your life

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hit a lick, rockin' the hip, hopin' to get hot when a nigga spit
Probably when the women get on me, talkin' the dick
Often the bitch drop when I rip
Niggas be jelly, they go through her cellie
And see her tell me she left shit in my telly
It's hurtin' his belly like bad meat at the deli
I have heat in my pelly pelly for the fuckboys
Make a nigga have to snuff boys, make enough noise
To make everyone drop when I bust toys when they suck soy
I'm gonna get my paper no matter what
Hateful fakers don't got enough, they goin' a nut
Get a fo'-fo' with ya ganja holdin' my do' in the cut
Play no games and I ain't no dame so I aim for pain
I'ma drain yo' brain when that thang go bang
Like I'm Django, man, and my aim goes bang
When I'm faced with jealousy, all the states throw mail at me
So it's making you march, wanna yell at me
When I react they call up Penelope's
Bitch ass, trick ass, sniff ass, ho
Just 'cause I get cash when I spit fast, now his ass low
Go get a sick pass and a bitch badge 'cause you get mad, bro
You 'bout to get flagged and you wondering if it's riff raff, no nigga

[Chorus: MeetSims]
You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up [?] jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow
You can lose your life

[Verse 3: Game]
I knew a couple niggas that I used to run with
Have fun with, get funds with
Shit get low, I had to bust a couple guns wet
Squad fell apart all over one bitch
Leave it to my nigga Ty to do some dumb shit
My Uzi weigh a ton shit
Run up in a nigga crib with the fire you can light a blunt with
Hollow tips in your belly, time to [?] shit
'Bout my paper, neighbor, fly nigga, aviator
Walk out the crib, nigga heated like a radiator
Bet I kill a nigga if he wanna die right now
Actin' like a recoverin' fiend, nigga, pipe down
He was gangsta yesterday, he believe in Christ now
Scope on you, no mouthwash, you in my sight now
If I don't get a call from Slay, somebody dyin'
Like 9-7, you hard pressed, get the iron
Yo Slay fuck these niggas dawg

[Chorus: MeetSims]
You can lose your life if you a jealous nigga
Fuck up [?] jealous niggas
Me bitch better, me whip wetter
Me neck shine, me wrist blow
You can lose your life

[Outro: Game]
Nigga be on some real Compton shit, nigga be out in New York doing whatever the fuck he wanna do. I'm just a thorough nigga, five borough nigga, project nigga from the Westside of Compton, you know what it is. L.A., that's my shit, New York
(You can lose your life)
