Casket music
Casket music

[Verse 1: Godemis]
Yeah, uhuh
It's killer city, anyone'll run up
You from around here, I ain't gotta tell you to duck
With very little unity, it's really never enough
People in the community don't band together enough
We all aware that it sucks, the hood resembles a pigsty
Even your baby mama tripping, kid got a Twist-Tie
And look at the list why
Niggas are not feeling me
Tryna live free and take zero accountability (Hold on)
Ya lie to kick it, you're probably wicked as Hillary
And she who does not feel me is just not real to me, dick tease
The nicest on the mic, tell the bitch please
Would you be kind enough to shut the fuck up and twist trees?
I'm on a high, I might be flyer than Chris Breez'
And I would never try to strike a chick with my fist, geez
I'm wise enough to know to just let a chick leave
And use the time to find and grind the methods to getting cheese

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I got a couple buddies that'll cross on ya border
And turn you into slaves for the new world order
Snake and bat's flying up inside close quarters
You can't keep it clean and dig the muddy waters
So step back youngin, this is grown folk talking
This isn't for the radio, this single won't be popping
This is true grit, it's lived for you to bash to it
Killer MC shit bitch, casket music

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
U-B-I, bitch
Yo, I crush a rhyme and when busting my flow is customised
They plagiarise when I'm writing it, so it's justified
And say goodnight if I ever switch into double time
They're sleepy, dusting their eyes, they listen to lullabies
Rubbing their eye while I'm running, wish I could shut an eye
So don't sit back and unwind, this isn't the summer time
It's duck and cover, if ever I pull your number time
It's sit for dinner and serve a sucker for supper time
My state of mind is transcending the space and time
You played a side so I am taking your place in line
Day in the life of the long winded, I stay alive
Only the strong survive in this game, I made it my
Bitch when I'm winning they're bitter, really what matters most
I learned the twist of these catacombs while I sat alone
My DNA incompatible with an average Joe
I catapult and I'm flying into the battle zone
Rep for the roster, partner pushing for proper pay
Chakras align while I'm oscillating like Doctor Strange
They cock and aim, lose nerve, but never drop a name
We are not the same, same difference is how we operate (Yeah)

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I got a couple buddies that'll cross on ya border
And turn you into slaves for the new world order
Snake and bat's flying up inside close quarters
You can't keep it clean and dig the muddy waters
So step back youngin, this is grown folk talking
This isn't for the radio, this single won't be popping
This is true grit, it's lived for you to bash to it
Killer MC shit bitch, casket music

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Astonishing, I can still hear my mama sing, upon a dream
Then Obama brings some no no things from the drama king
I want a fling but with mama singing its wronger thing
So I'ma keep fondling this honor queen from the conjuring
Dude's crazy, he's who's baby
Maude Sue lady through Hades fools made me lose faith
We bruise fugazis
Who played me like ukulele, too shady, ooze rouge gravy
Out your noodle, you pussy punk, you's a poodle
I push your peanut to Pluto, and then pack your parents in a Peugeot
Better yet in a Yugo, yes y'all a eulogys you know
After killing like Cujo
I'm catching a wave nouveau
Eh-Eh
To the rancid area this belong to
Eh-Eh
Drink away my pain and then piss it on you
Give the song new meaning, eat it up, beat it up
If it's wrong you bringing, fuck you!
Here's new Ninna to rock to

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I got a couple buddies that'll cross on ya border
And turn you into slaves for the new world order
Snake and bat's flying up inside close quarters
You can't keep it clean and dig the muddy waters
So step back youngin, this is grown folk talking
This isn't for the radio, this single won't be popping
This is true grit, it's lived for you to bash to it
Killer MC shit bitch, casket music
