[Intro: Tyler Lyon]
Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I been burnin' in my own hell for the duration
Of escapin' this place and it swept across the nation
That place is pain and tribulation
Instead of wastin' this achin', I give it awakening motivation
Yeah, I burn so you won't have to
I rap through fire flame you wouldn't wanna adapt to
This trying is totally tough, Tech is turbulent
I further vent to the masses who are watching on this obscure event

[Pre-Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Feel as the fire consumes you through
Know that it's scorchin' just for you
Burnin' the way that you want it to
Only the torrid make it through

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
My pain lessens theirs because it puts who they put on a pedestal on a level playing field with them

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I go through hell and I share it with you
Arid quick to cleanse me and get the merits you care to issue
A therapist who sweared to get you through a crisis
Soon as I write this, you invite this terror to view
So much death around me, stress to drown me
You get the sound we invest checks to crown me
The frown free, but no matter how loaded, I'm down D
Double E-P in amidst of a mess, N9ne is tougher than bounty
Torrid

[Pre-Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Your light, casting back the dark night
Even faster than we, could fly
Hotter than the sun before me

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
Feel as the fire consumes you through
Know that it's scorchin' just for you
Burnin' the way that you want it to
Only the torrid make it through

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Why is it me that gotta be the light source
Through my darkness, I created a bright force
The book told me, "Behold a white horse"
But I didn't fear the death, I'd just report it, I am your life's torch
The pain shows and fame grows
Angel Heart and Evil Brain chose insane flows
To try to control the direction the flame goes
It aims low, then it build up and the thing blow
I don't know why it's the darkness that they desire y'all
Hotter than mixing 151 with grain and fireball
But that emotion made my entire empire ball
I guess I was a chosen one so God gave me this dire call

[Outro: Tyler Lyon] (x2)
Make divide between you and the confined
Escape tonight (Escape tonight, I'm alive)
