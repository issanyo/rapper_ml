[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali baby, ooooh
Ohhhh, Darrein
I rep the snake and the bat

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Maybe it's me
I look too much and blame it on the turn-up
I know that it's me
You come through in the clutch and tell me I should burn up
You know what I like
I like a good nude, you know I love you like cooked food
Don't need no stress
Just give me reggie, I don't need the best
I, can say nothing to you
I rep the royal, the rest of it's boo-boo
Give me that yoohoo
I mean the stank and some drank
Spill on my bank on the dank
Got me in love with the tank
She blowing pipe like a poop
Get to it when I hit the booth and I get the dude
And we like bang bang rocking mountain high
And you already know

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Darrein Safron]
Lately I been going through it
Life is tough and I've been more into it
Feel like I wanna lay you down
She know the thing that turn my day around
So we burn
When shit gets too real
I just tell her give me something I can feel
Baby, we burn
When things ain't alright
I just tell her won't you put me in the sky

[Verse 2: Darrein Safron]
Now I don't wanna talk about you stressing
Bout your man not texting
I just caught that get me up
Pick me up off [?]
Oh yeah
Now we just riding and rolling
As soon as we smoking that stress go away
I know that this good smoke got you feeling yourself
Mine just beat a pootie-tang with your belt
I don't smoke out unless you down to fuck
I'm not that drug dealer you played at the club
I don't think she know yet though
Baby don't trip, light it up

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Darrein Safron]
Lately I been going through it
Life is tough and I've been more into it
Feel like I wanna lay you down
She know the thing that turn my day around
So we burn
When shit gets too real
I just tell her give me something I can feel
Baby, we burn
When things ain't alright
I just tell her won't you put me in the sky

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko] (x2)
Light it up, light it up, light it up (light it up!)
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up (roll it up!)
Put it, in the, air
Babe, put it, in the, air (put it up!)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Everything is about to become falling
Down on me now I'm tripping and I'm crawling
Evil people try shaking me down
All of this ache can be found deep in this heart I just let y'all in
How they coming at Nina's show is a pity
Cause super be trill I guess the one with the dough and is the nitty
Gritty is the situation people knowing is litty
We're going to city, it's crazy time for blowing up blizzy
She's such a relief rush to pick me up
To get chiefed up, she roll the weed up when I need puff
Cause that grief sucks and she's freed up
When she, give it to me the favor is returned
She got the fire got me thinking it be shirm
When all the evil is coming at me stirring
I finish my day then call my baby yeah we burn

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Darrein Safron]
Lately I been going through it
Life is tough and I've been more into it
Feel like I wanna lay you down
She know the thing that turn my day around
So we burn
When shit gets too real
I just tell her give me something I can feel
Baby, we burn
When things ain't alright
I just tell her won't you put me in the sky

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I got it I got it
Oah
Now baby can you take me to a place, where I can feel my face?
Oah
Now baby can you take me to a place, where I can feel my face?
