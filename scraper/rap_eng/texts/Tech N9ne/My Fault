[Chorus: Nave Monjo]
They try to take me out the game, but ain't no stoppin' me
No, I'll never change it I don't owe any apologies
Yeah fuck what they thought, I rise and they fall
Got all of these rules just to live by the law
This is my show if I don't get no applause
I'm just bein' me, ain't no way it's my fault, no, no

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I was rockin' a show back in '03, a pack a people started lovin' me, lowkey
I give 'em a lot of MO sounds, they seen some cats in more towns
Rappers from Cleveland and rappers from OC
Forever bound and lovin' the clever sounds
Were the people seekin' my evil and peepin' the redder clown throwin' down
Lot of love going 'round, got the blood blowin' now
It was a group effort the Juggalos and the Metalheads
The thugs and college kids they boost records
No matter whose neck in the woods, crews get work
All in together, no matter whose net worth
So many years with Whoop Whoop experts
Then something got weird just like a blue Tech shirt
Hot 97 compared the two vet's work
Pretty much said, "They one in the same," ooh that hurts
Somebody you can't compare to anyone
All they knew for sure is that I'm makin' plenty funds
I took offense to the incredible sin he brung
It's some Juggalos took it bad and wanted to gimme guns
Death threats from a couple of tough Jugs
When they leader said I wasn't really givin' enough love on the show
To the Juggalo this is not for all of the family but to the few that is trippin' to Hell you can go

[Chorus: Nave Monjo]
They try to take me out the game but ain't no stoppin' me
No, I'll never change it I don't owe any apologies
Yeah, fuck what they thought, I rise and they fall
Got all of these rules just to live by the law
This is my show if I don't get no applause
I'm just bein' me, ain't no way it's my fault, no, no

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Last Strictly Strange Tour off in Milwaukee, 3,000 fans, so I feel bossy
'Cause I remember we used to play The Rave downstairs now we up in The Room, it's real costly
All the people, they catchin' the chills off me
My camera crew is tapin' the ill frosties
From the fans, we makin' the ladies dance
And the ladies are elated, not sedated like Bill Cosby's
They just waitin' for the ooh Areola near the end of the show then we do Areola
We didn't see anything but a few aureola
Out of so many women, so that was boo Areola
Only saw 4 from the stage
When they up on the shoulders you can never tell they underage
Next day when the parent was creepin' on her daughter's page
Saw the vid of her daughter flashin' and now she in a rage
She made her daughter tell authorities we made her do it
Yeah right, more like the guy that raised her to it
My partner O' apostrophe called me hostily
Sayin' the cameras got 'em yellin' child pornography
We been doing Areola for 8 years
Now we gotta stay clear 'cause some fake tears
Tried to shut Tech down, so I cut that now, when I bust that sound
But I betcha Milwaukee really fucked that 'round
When the Tech Ninna come into ya town

[Chorus: Nave Monjo]
They try to take me out the game but ain't no stoppin' me
No, I'll never change it I don't owe any apologies
Yeah, fuck what they thought, I rise and they fall
Got all of these rules just to live by the law
This is my show if I don't get no applause
I'm just bein' me, ain't no way it's my fault, no, no

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
None of this shit is my fault
(So long Areola)
Yeah, none of this shit is my fault
(It was fun while it lasted)
Know they was winnin' but lost
(Damn)
Tryin' to shut out a boss
