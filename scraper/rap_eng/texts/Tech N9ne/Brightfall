[Verse 1]
I come from it, but it seems impossible to run from it
All the evil I did to people then could none stomach?
No, 'cause when my spirits go up, now every one plummets
I can light all, with this angel but that demon will make the brightfall
When your angle is to reason with those who night crawl
Psycho searchin' so they get even with a life you lost and was leavin'
But it might be costin' this season, when the fight calls
People change their life of sin
Then try to negate the back, they aimed the knife within
A shame, I can win the game, be nice to friends
Then bang, my revenge, it came to wipe this grin then pain
Fight your demons I'd advise it, it's there no matter how you try to hide it
In private, you're runnin' from the people that despise it
Don't you lie and deny this, sick hybrid
Angel demon ain't no leavin' either one
Can't take it back where you got the evil from
This magnitude, the angel will need a gun
So much evil I saw, in the past when I was bad, now I'm right y'all
But evil remains to make the brightfall

[Chorus]
God knows I'm trying
It seems like I'm always fighting
For my life, for my soul
This won't bring me down

[Verse 2]
All I want is heaven but evil forces, they follow me
Plottin' on my body to attempt to torch it or hollow me
I cannot let the depths of Hell to rise up and swallow me
I'm tryna make it where the other angels and God'll be
This is terrible, fightin' the past me is unbearable
Never really mattered if my symbols and outfit were clerical
Judgin' today for past demons make me hysterical
Darkness is blindin', take me back in the city of Jericho
Darkness will not win, my heart is really not grim
But the chances of me becomin' pure angel has got slim
I'm stuck and I'm blocked in, brightness, the plots been
Wanna frolic in God, I'm lookin' for solace but it got dim
How can I detach from the past, the heinous acts
Will I last? Will they attack with a blast?
When the night calls, it's gonna be a nice brawl
For the darkness to come and make my brightfall

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Get it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out
Don't ever wanna see, what that pit about
We just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out
Get it out! Spit it out! Evil in ya mix, rid it out
Don't ever wanna see, what that pit about
We just stomp, we just thump, we just grit it out

[Verse 3]
I'm fighting for a bright life
But evil wanna consume me and my soul is the right price
That would literally be a fright night
But I ain't sellin' my soul to hell, angels yellin' propellin' flight heights
Wanna spread these angel wings
But they have wicked entangled things
Like steamin' hot tar with the stench of brimstone
Knee in God's yard, can I repent the sin gone?
Did that, done that, then the evil comes back
Runnin' from myself, it seems it ain't no runnin' from that
Just when you wanna start anew
They judge you on what you used to be, thus makin' it harder to
But I refuse to lose, even if I gotta be banged and bruised
Why do we have to battle just to go the bright route?
Oh well, I'm 'bout to beat this Hell until it's lights out

[Outro]
Alive and I'm well, did I win in hell? The fight just to save my soul
'Cause time and time again, when I crawl to the light, I land in sin
Now my sins so far away, that darkness will never find me
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
Hideous, hideous, grotesque, grotesque
