[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You know what it is, punk
Time to get it poppin' and get this bitch crunk
Kansas City king, with the Kings
Causin' calamity, dammit we bring
Heat, with just thee right flume
Yes, meet my crew
On some F-T-I two
Nigga we underdoggin', that don't mean we under y'all and
On tour like a motherfucker gettin' the dough
Everybody know we thunderballin'
But the industry's lame
Scared of these colors, scared of these brains
This fuckin' industry is scared of me man
Been in this rap game, for nineteen years
In nineteen years, it's been a minute, since I've seen tears
These frightening fears right here have made me strong as hell
Superstar, bring my partners along as well
I told y'all, we road hogs
Fuck this industry I fold y'all, with this roll call (Roll call)
Loc, Judge, Lou, X, Richter, Pak, Bobby, Tax, and Tech
Independent figures cause nigga we vets

[Verse 2: D-Loc]
Industry, bunch of punks
All these fools, eat 'em up
Spit 'em out, on the flo'
Let 'em know, we 'bout the flow
Hit 'em high, hit 'em low
Hit 'em good, here we go
Hold 'em down, hurry up
Dot his eye, split his lip
Put that shit up
We're the Kottonmouth Kings and we're that click bitch
And we don't give a fuck
Now if you wanna see deuce click
[?]
So sit back, relax, shut the fuck up, and cock calhouns

[Johnny Richter]
Now I'm out to help you understand where the fuck I'm comin from
It's Johnny Richter, but this weekend, I'm the chosen one
And that right there is the reason they pissed

Been doin this shit, for ten years (ten years!)
And I'm still here (still here!)

You can't believe we got this industry scratchin their domes
Packin' shows from coast to coast, every cities our home
You better ask somebody, who holds the key
And my peace to rock a [?], said I'm X Daddy
I'll leave you laid out, played out
Reachin' and graspin'
Hopin' to get a piece of this here underground action
You should get bitch-slapped just for fuckin' askin
You'll start to burn like a chemical reaction

[D-Loc]
Double dash, in the s
Where the weed, where the hash
Light the blunt, feelin' good
In the cut, what the fuck!
Give it up, give it to 'em
Set 'em up, roll right through
Knock 'em down, pick 'em up
Now we know, that's all them hoes

[Verse 4: Johnny Richter]
You see, I don't give a fuck about no magazine covers
Cause the fans, they love us
And my band, well they're just like my brothers from another mother
No other way to break it, I'm down
For fo' with six KMK members is raised to the crown

[Daddy X]
[?], put 'em up high
Kottonmouth Kings on the track, the greatest rapper alive
Tech N9ne with KMK, fool, who'd ya think?
You can etch it in a [?] with permanent ink
We survivors here, free and clear, not like I need it
Just a fat beat, laced right
And a blunt to get weeded
(Just a fat beat, laced right
And a blunt to get weeded)
