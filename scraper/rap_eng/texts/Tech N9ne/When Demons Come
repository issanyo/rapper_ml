[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
These days I don't know how I feel
Trying to find anything that's real
In a world where everyone says God is your name
You can really lose sight because everything feels right
But in the middle of the night
People hit the dislike and they coming with a fight
Will you bang when demons come?

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
When the darkness grabs your hand
Lead you into the sand
It'll take you down its blackened hallways
Please don't be afraid
Come and speak my name
And I will take your pain like always

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
All the kids stay inside, yeah
The angels gonna bleed their divine disguise
Yeah, their soul is an angel's prize
Yeah, we never gonna let em get us
Gonna get em let up, so the evil demon devils
They better run and HIDE! (hide, hide, hide)

[Hook: Tyler Lyon]
When the darkness grabs your hand
Lead you into the sand
It'll take you down its blackened hallways
Please don't be afraid
Come and speak my name
And I will take your pain like always
