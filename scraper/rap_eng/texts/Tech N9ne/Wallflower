[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Must be hard to be able to put everybody you know down
Maybe you never really had to know how
How it feels to be inferior to you
And I can only imagine, and it can only be tragic
To have the women fall at your feet, just a piece of meat, ah!

[Bridge 1: Krizz Kaliko]
When life gives you lemon, you make lemonade
And I could surely be up, but I been afraid
You are the one, you are the one
So what you want, can you get it done?
I'd like to put ya rubber mask in the fire but you never run

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Then there's me and I don't even dance
And I won't take a chance
To let you put that note on my back, kick me in my pants
And I don't even know
What it feels like to glow
I leave that up to y'all
I'll be the flower on the wall

A-one, two, flower do do
A-three, four, flower do do

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Must be hard when you know they gonna be knockin' ya door down
Tell me which one of you gonna come now
And you got them boys fighting for you
You so fine, so fine
And I'm so blind, so blind
Tell me how does it feel for you to win every time

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Now when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade
And I can surely be up but I been afraid
Go to the mall and buy everything
'Cause you could fit damn near like everything
You're like the portrait of a model
But your beauty ain't out of a bottle

[Hook 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Then there's she, she don't even dance
She won't take a chance
To let you put the note on her back, kick her in her pants
And she don't even know
What it feels like to glow
Leave it up to y'all
And be the flower on the wall

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I used to think it must be nice
To be the popular dude in school and duck these fights
They pick it with me 'cause I'm bummy with scuffy Nikes
The cheerleader I wanted to date had ducked me twice
You know the ladies they love me, psych
They needed me just like a Sunday-school bus need Christ
Always down on my luck, please life
Can you give me something brighter when I un-clutch these dice
Rolled 'em, pressed a lot of records and then I sold 'em
Then it screwed how I posed and turned Lamar Odom
Dollars I can't fold them, guess I showed 'em
Those who never chose him: the hoes all on my scrotum
Shut off, closed out, all of them get the synonym
Do you remember them two squares in school, you know Aaron and Chris; now they blew up and rapping with Eminem?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I 'member them

A-one, two, flower do do, eh ya
A-three, four, flower do do

[Hook 1]
And I don't even dance
And I won't take a chance
To let you put that note on my back, kick me in my pants
And I don't even know
What it feels like to glow
I leave that up to y'all
Flowers on the wall
