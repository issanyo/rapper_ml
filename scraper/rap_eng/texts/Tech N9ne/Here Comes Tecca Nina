[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Message marked urgent
Hey, hey, hey
What's sizzlin' everybody
North side, south side, east and west
I'd like to welcome everybody to Absolute Power baby
This is Big Krizz Kaliko recordin' from Kansas City, Missouri
'Bout to world premiere another one of those other ones
From that psycho y'all know and love, my nigga
Tech N9ne!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I be bustin' (bustin')
Parents be fussin' and cussin'
'Cause all I talk about is silicone and muffins (muffins)
So if you didn't come to hear some strips clubs hits
Then get the hell on 'cause I'm gettin' my mail on, I'm hustlin'
I'm talkin' about foes and I'm talkin' about fans and kitties
I'm talkin' about hoes and I'm talkin' about Kansas City
That's where I dwell with- with my- my Vills
And I- I- I will pop hot rocks for real
Venomous, when it gets hot
The Tech straight killin' hatas, when it gets rock
The sex rates ten, I made her sit on this jock
Spits quick game innovator
Chick generator, quick trip James Lemonader
This is the beginnin' of blingin' and houses and women
Welcomin' angels and demons on couches and sinnin'
I'm alive and well, the demise will bring ghost stories
When I rise in hell them alive will still vote for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Banzai, baby every one's high
Smokin' and drinkin' and poppin' so hurry come fly
'Cause I got plenty rolls, and I got plenty dough
And we got plenty hoes, we roll on 24s
What it is? What it was? What it shall be?
What the blizz? Where the ale? Where the belve?
Caribou Lou is 151 and Malibu Rum and pineapple
So what's this weakness you tryna sell me?
I represent the Rogue Dog Villain niggas
Betta repent, the foes all feelin' triggas
You got me bent, we rolls all peelin' skrilla
Roll call Villian killas, froze y'all fill in millas
This be the best time, to bust ya best rhyme
You bring ya best rhyme, I'm on yo next line
And when I flex mine, I see respect signs
Call the request line, and just say Tech N9ne!

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
They call me Tecca Nina, that be my nick name
I often wreck arenas, most of 'em chicks man
Spoil us with checks and Visa, that's how we spit game
Havin' her bless the weiner, I love to get brain
Four chicks in the back of the truck
Backin' it up, suckin' on tongues, laughin' it up
Gassin' at Kutt, bustin' her bun, slappin' it up
Quick wrappin' it up, get thrust with no funds then passin' the butt
Absolute when I shoot the shit
Juice the chicks with flows that you used to get
Take 'em to Adam's house, gon' ride 'em out
Or take 'em down to Wes' get breastes up in ya face
And scat 'em out
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
I got the sickness horny chicks mighty mine be
Straight doom for the crew that skeet like chumps
I bring 'em six-six triple eight forty-six ninety nine three
