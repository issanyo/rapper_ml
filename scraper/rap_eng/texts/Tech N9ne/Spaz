[Intro]
While listening to this song, take it easy
Don't dance or make noise at all
Please don't mosh or scream and please refrain from any erratic behavior
Never mind, go crazy SPAZ!

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
(Spawned) Off in the 70's, 80's, baby
I’m a bust to the death of me
(Gone) No sanity left in me
Middle fingers up to haters who slept on me
(Snore) On all you nay sayers, you’ll take it back
The snake and bat isn't having that (war)
(Your) Menu, filleting you, you backpacking
Back stabbing, livin’ on different rap (you)
And I ain’t aimin’ for the middle
Tryna eat and get the viddles, I ain’t talking bout a little bit
And I ain’t ashamed to be the Mental Giant's protégé
That mean niggas is getting 'Blown Away'
Nickname Kali Baby, winning all my medals, and they going crazy
And if you feel the same as me
Come on and go insane with me!

[Hook]
If you feel like you’ll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, you still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy standing there
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
(Kali) Baby, do what you never did
Come to get cheddar, enough that I get it (Around me)
Let them be getting some money Twitter it
Kill niggas actin’ confederate (Ninna)
He put me on just a minute ago
In TV all off in the video (GENIUS!)
Okay I said it again if you didn't know
(Watch me) Ba-ba-ba-babblin’ better than half of you rappers
I spit like a javelin (Stop me)
Trapped and traffic compadiris
You niggas earthling and I’m off of Saturn and (Me)
Who be the bestest from the Midwestest
Go get your people, your men in here
(Flee) Cause I can damage it, you niggas amateurs
I'm Son of Sam and I'm handling

[Hook]
If you feel like you’ll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, you still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy standing there
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
(DWAMN!)
Incredible to be back in medical procedures with Kaliko slicin' ya
(HAM!) Don't nobody go hard as a motherfucker
But just the murderers you hear in this
(JAM!) You'll never wanna be the one, I get it
When I veteran, I go psycho sick and crack on top it'll be
(BAM!) I can be real honory
My persona be all of you gotta honor me (The king!)
Better believe us, we will level you negras
Like a devil deceiver’s rippin' you to pieces, screamin' "No Jesus"
Chopper the big boss, I'm often awkward
Profitable thoughts are popping off in cash
They make rappers lose it all for the music but never the big homie Tech cause I'ma spaz!

[Hook]
If you feel like you’ll go insane then
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
Everything you think is not the same, you still
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
If you test the water prepare to swim
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
You might just go crazy standing there
Spaz! spaz! spaz! spaz!
