[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Every day I wake up
Even if I don't feel like it
I push, push myself
And the response from the people
Makes me feel like I'm floating

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Levitation, no hesitating
I came too far to look back now
All my decisions was so I can win and
It feel like I’m a champion, yeah

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]:
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I came too far to look back now
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I feel like I’m a champion, yeah

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
When I wake, I wash my face then get it in (get it in)
Schedule filled and still I gots to fit it in (fit it in)
They dependin' on me (who) family, fans, and homies (true)
Have to understand, it's all about the team not only (you)
When I work, I feel like I can fly in the sky
All the love they give Ninna get me high, ain't no lie
If I wasn't such a killa, I would cry, not that guy
Levitation, dedication in my eye 'til I die
(Whoa) people know I got it from the dirt
(Whoa) so rough when I started man it hurt
(Whoa) but all that struggle paid off
I'm a business owner now I can't be laid off (hell nah)
Whatever you do, do it every day
And do somethin' different, if it's true it barely pay
Don't be a jack of all trades and a master of none
I chose to give you rap, I'ma blaze and I'm after the sun, I won

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Levitation, no hesitating
I came too far to look back now
All my decisions was so I can win and
It feel like I’m a champion, yeah

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]:
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I came too far to look back now
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I feel like I’m a champion, yeah

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Push it to the limit, ain't no limit for me
Look what we invented, such a win is funny
'Cause when I wanted to end it, no success felt like I'm finished
But my friend with the other percentage said, "Let's go get this money"
People really care 'bout how I feel and it's real
'Cause I put the middle finger to a major record deal
For this independent label had to peel hella skrill
Now we all around the planet makin' mills, how that feel
(Whoa) like it lit a fire in my soul
(Whoa) got a push it higher 'til it grows
(Whoa) levitatin' like I'm David Blaine
Yellin' loud, "I made it, mane," 'cause we all created Strange
I'm thankful for y'all dedication
And rep Strange though, with no hesitation
The white black and the red is waitin'
To dead this hate until it's devastation
And have a better nation
Where all the love feel like levitation

[Bridge: Navé Monjo]
Levitation, no hesitating
I came too far to look back now
All my decisions was so I can win and
It feel like I’m a champion, yeah

[Chorus: Navé Monjo]:
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I came too far to look back now
Levitate yeah, levitate yeah
I feel like I’m a champion, yeah
Oh yeah
