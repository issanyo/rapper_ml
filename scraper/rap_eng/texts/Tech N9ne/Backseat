[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hum baby hum, put my stick up on your tongue
Better run ‘til I get up in your lungs, here I come
You’re the one that’ll get a nigga sprung
If you’re done with the thumb motion
I’m getta a gun, get it done
In the backseat
I’ma put the tallywhacker into that meat
Got her running from a killer ‘cause I pack heat
Got that ass beat, fucking with an athlete
I’m a mad beast, stick her like the last piece, ask me to stab meat
When I’m messin’, mention it, that’ll be a bad week
If you let me step in you better be a tad freak
The Hennessy, rest in peace, ready when you half-sleep
I’m rollin, I’m ragin’, blazing in Copenhagen
Playing and scoping babes and hoping they been open havens
For blokes and maidens looking for the soaking bay for the ocean spraying
I’m promoting laying folks and aiding those and poking they friends
Well, I’ma make that gel, you will never hit a nigga with an L
Any believing you gon’ finish me I’ma quell
They’ll never get it tweeted, I bring hell when I nail
Ya bitch, don’t incite the sniper
Hope you knowing that my pipes are viper
Met you once and I hit it twice, really hyper
That is the way that I like to slice ya

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
Your bitch wanna hang with a nigga with a chain
That be fucking with a gang called Strange
She was looking like a main, I was spitting my game
Told her hop in this Range, little pretty young thing
Now have you ever (ever, ever, ever)
Fucked a bitch and made her cum fast?
I was rubbing on her titties, I was slapping on her ass
When I stuck my dick in, man that pussy just splashed
She was fine in the face with an all-star frame
Met that bitch at the All-Star Game
Don’t remember her name but I ‘member her brain
Suck a dick so good, made a nigga feel drained
Ok I got it, I remember
Bad redbone bitch named Brenda
She was 5’9”, she loved Tech N9ne
She gave me Einstein, so I bent her
She said grab me, squeeze me, touch me, tease me
Hurt me, beat me, I said take this dick you beezy
After dicking her out you know I’m kicking her out
And wasn’t tripping about what she was bickering ‘bout
She was smokin’ some tree, smokin’ some weed
I said fuck that joint, put a dick in your mouth
She said “I love you!”, I said “What bitch?”
You is nothing more but a slut bitch
Just to fuck bitch, just to nut bitch
But I love the way that you suck dick

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I beat it up and beat it up, repeatedly, repeatedly
She tellin’ me she needed it, immediately, immediately
You got all the brain lil mama, you the geekiest
But if she not a freaky bitch, her number I deleted it
Have her like (oh), back shots (oh)
Front shots (oh), Cognac shots (oh)
You gon’ need another set of ass shots
Put that D on your chest like a mascot
I’m a modern day technician, modern day technician
Girl what you doing in the kitchen?
Bending over, you ain’t washing dishes
Aw, see when you living in the fast lane
You learn to make decisions faster
Stunting like Bruce Lee, but baby I am not an actor
See I’m the type of nigga that’ll
Give her what she really after
She swallow all of these babies
Call her the kidnapper
