[Intro]
Hard workers get the last laugh
Yeah, and you can't go get it by sitting on your ass
You gotta be ready to get up and go

[Verse 1]
People think the wrong way
When you're working and won't play
Calling my phone and I won't say
Nothing when they be huffing and puffing
But I know fucking off a day which it don't pay
Not a damn thing, wanna be a damn king
Might have to run and jump over the bumps
And push 'til you pull a hamstring, for real
That's 'cause I'm moving my feet
You don't work, you don't eat
So when I don't respond, I ain't asleep
I been giving the day a lot of me and I'm in deep
Concentration, contemplatin' compensation support and
My obligations, my creations while I'm facing divorce
And I'm making moves, constantly shaking fools
I can't be late and lose, no working with faking dudes
Moving quick and I'm jolly, it ain't because of molly
I'm working to move ya body, then racing my bitch to Bali
Catch me, I'm in the zone, I don't answer my phone
Steady writing my songs, if you're next to me, I'm gone (gone)
My head's rapping, always thinking of stacking
While you slacking and yapping
We trying to make something happen

[Hook]
Nigga, we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen
Yeah we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen

[Verse 2]
We ain't working, she ain't twerking
That's gonna mean the scene ain't jerking
We the first to see the thirst and get sex
'Cause we see the purse, then reimburse them
When they be squirting D and bursting
Me in person, reinsertion, Tech's flesh
So don't be calling like "where you been?"
You don't know 'cause you not within
My circle of friends, a nigga working again
I gotta get them ones, tens, yen
Gotta get that almighty dollar before I get the call by the father
Better yet, when I gotta move on like alrighty mama
Niggas be telling me I think you selling me
Dreams embellishing when I say other things
When I say yes, I'ma do what I say
Betcha N9na got something to do every day
Don't got time to shoot the shit
'Cause I got a whole lot of love and loot to get
Acting like you's a bitch on my phone
I'ma do ya like a vampire knocking the crucifix
(La, la, la)
I ain't try'na hear nothing, when I'm deep in work bussing
My butt anybody calling me fussing, I'm ducking
(La, la, la)
If you ain't talking 'bout getting it
This is what I'm gonna say if I pick up my phone and you hittin' it

[Hook]
Nigga, we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen
Yeah we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen

[Bridge]
You (you)
Got (got)
The (the)
Nerve (nerve)
To (to)
Say (say)
We (we)
Stay (stay)
Sleeping (sleeping)
Slipping (slipping)
Sipping (sipping, yeah you tripping)

[Verse 3]
Everybody round me work a tour or something
Just so they can afford something
Like islands and buying much real estate
Yeah yeah nigga
I ain't got time for your nonsense
Ever since mom went a little fond of me I got a few bill to make
Yeah yeah nigga
Please get up off of my line
Leave, you ain't crossing my mind, when I'm deep in these pages What I'm doing's freaking outrageous with the Pinky and the Brain
(Trying to take over the world)
But you're clingy and you're lame
(Crying like you take hoes over girls, man)
They say I act like I'm too good
Way up in the clouds but N9na started in the hood
Leave me 'lone boy
They be calling my phone like "what you doing?"
Yo N9na we doing nothing
Strange Slcket and K-Lean Cocina

[Hook]
Nigga, we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen
Yeah we working
We just push it
Try'na make something
Happen, happen, happen, happen
