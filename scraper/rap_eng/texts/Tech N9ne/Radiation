[Verse 1: Adina Howard]
It's like meditation, someone touch with my inner goddess right now
That's a celebration, I'm just too fly right now
For your limitations, I'm not gon' let you kill the vibe right now
But your federation[??]
I can hear my momma waitin'

[Bridge: Adina Howard]
So pull me up one time, everybody it's a celebration
Cause we about to get right right now, admiration
That's how 808's drive, tell me, can you feel the radiation
From the hottest chick in the room right now?

[Hook: Adina Howard]
It's like radiation
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
It's like radiation
(It's like, it's like, it's like)
It's like radiation
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)

(It's like, it's like, it's like)

[Verse 2: Adina Howard]
I can sense your hesitation
Scared that I'm just another broad right now
In the situation
Dark shades can't save you from my eyes right now
Baby, you've been waitin'
You know I'm only in town for the night
Now, let us get an understanding
(So I suggest you do right)
We can either run away then

[Bridge: Adina Howard]
So pull me up one time, everybody it's a celebration
Cause we about to get right right now, admiration
That's how 808's drive, tell me, can you feel the radiation
From the hottest chick in the room right now?

[Hook: Adina Howard]
It's like radiation
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
It's like radiation
(It's like, it's like, it's like)
It's like radiation
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
Can you feel it? (It's like)
(It's like, it's like, it's like)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
As soon as I walk in the room you feel a king's presence
Now all the ballers in the room to you really seem peasants
Electricity from my chakras are what stopped ya but my posture
Is what got ya, cause I stand like you know I get it aqua
Smashin', I get it brackin'
I been a thug with a whole lot of passion
Doin' everything that you can imagine
To keep lastin', then I'm blastin'
On your torso, I'm a Scorp', so
Ain't no trippin' no place off Ortho
Cause she know she can get that her maze
Buckin' .35 seein' Borgo
Crocodile tho, got a pile a' dough
Just a lockdown for the hot canal
Really jock your mouth go
Cause I radiate
Ain't no lazy brakes
Cause I'm crazy Yates
But I gotta be a gentleman, I ate that before my lady ate
That is why your chick may be waitin'
Really knowin' I keep ladies wastin'
Takin' a pawn from me, lickin' the bar from T
Cause I'm flyer than aviation
I'm your baby play friend
Baby girl, it's just some radiation, got them ladies hatin'

[Hook: Adina Howard]
It's like radiation
