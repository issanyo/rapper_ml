[Intro]
I'm just a young boy trying to get my money on
Making music in KC
But Mitch Bade niggas want to hate Tecca Ninna
And they won't stop fucking with me
So I'ma fuck wit' niggas

Na na na na na you cannot fuck wit'
That nigga Tech N9ne coming wit' that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when the heard it
Have the nerve to say it's nothing niggas so I got to bust it

(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all y'all haters
(Be jealous) I see you watching me when I walked in the club
(Be jealous) this is dedicated to all mitch baders
(Be Jealous) you motherfuckers ain't showing Tech Ninna no love

[Verse 1]
Fuck motherfuckers, buck motherfuckers
Here the pain come nigga wit' a bang, I'm a killa better duck motherfucker
What you standing on, nada
What you plan to bone, nada
What you plan to own, nada
Your shit done came and gone
Sweat no tears nigga, been about 15 years nigga
Ain't never been no fears nigga, all I hear is cheers nigga
That's why I be in the bathroom wit' bitches at maniacs
That's why them hoes in the club wit' Tech giving blow jobs in the back
How many niggas really wanna bust skulls?
How many niggas wanna become a was?
Fuck with a nigga like Tech get a buzz
Right through the head and the grave is dug
Mean mugs, niggas ain't never seen love
So they stream blood when I fiend bud for the green shrubs
And mushrooms I bust rooms open accustomed
To floating across the ocean with verbal motion the notion
Is boasting I'm poking jealous, motherfuckers embellish
The truth to say I ain't worthy for fame, yaks and relish

[Hook]
(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas
(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming wit' bitches around me
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Hella lit, I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit

[Verse 2]
No more styling I'm start wilding on niggas, growling on niggas
And we smiling 'cause the villain album went 6000 on niggas
In Kansas City alone, leave Tech, Big Dog, Will, Mike and Nitty alone
Midwest Side, Lejo, Melly Mel I love you but it's a pity you gone
Niggas hating on mine 'cause they knowing I'ma do it big
That's why the Tecca Ninna never ever got a problem getting a gig
'Cause I rip shit they like, I flip shit you may bite
When I spit shit I get rich quick, I make heats from dark to daylight
N9ne millimeter guns, gonna be the one making a million when I come
Never gonna be the bomb, where I come from niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas
So now it's time for N9ne Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me, 'cause your bitch play Tecca Ninna all day
And you see me on MTV, kicking it with King Tech, my nigga Sway
Broke niggas ain't friends to me
You niggas really want me to disperse
Alright I'll leave but when I come back it's gonna be 20 g's a verse nigga

[Hook]
(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas
(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming wit' bitches around me
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Hella lit. I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit

[Verse 3]
Niggas better stop talking about me, I ain't did shit
I don't rap against niggas stop trying to get me to rap, so y'all could make grip
Agony don't be speaking my name, I know I fucked up
On a personal tip but if you niggas talking 'bout me, better rap motherfuckers better duck
If any niggas over there on the inside
Infiltrating on me and my rogues
Them niggas don't give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And who ever you bitch niggas is, saying I'm peeking in Lejo's log
Lejo'll tell you I'm original, and by the way Lejo my dog
And the jealous motherfuckers won't quit
Said The Calm Before the Storm ain't shit
We killed y'all in 96 97
What about when the new shit hits
And I heard niggas said was washed up
Said the Tech N9ne flow is sleep
That's probably why I got shit in the movies
Like Thicker Than Water and In Too Deep
Tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me mad enough to bust one
I'm the second coming but you don't know 'cause you dumb
Before I go I'll tell you jealous motherfuckers to suck one

[Hook]
(Be jealous) when you see me on the TV screen wilding
(Be jealous) when you see me in the magazine smiling
(Be jealous) when they let me in the club for free niggas
(Be jealous) 'cause I'm bumming wit' bitches around me
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Haha motherfucker haha
Hella lit. I'ma spit, I'ma kick that shit
