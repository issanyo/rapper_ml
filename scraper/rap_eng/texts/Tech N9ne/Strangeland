[Tech]
Well uhh.. how did I get here?
[Girl]
Well that’s simple, Mr. Yates
[Tech]
What, do you mean?
[Girl]
You’re the creator

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
What I saw was amazing after raising up and
Gazing at the babe that said I'm creating nights and days and paving
The way for raging Tech-aholics
Making havens, next to all this hate and crazing
Death, we call it a place of consummation
Of perfection, fulfillment, the Tech runs the building
Respect one's resilience, from threats guns and illnesses
This place is realness, it feels as if its lifted
A bit sick and twisted and real wicked, villages
And I'm the main man
That made every effort to gain fans
Through all my pain I obtain grands
Millions just cause of my brain and my lane stands
Insane rands the name brand, call it Strangeland

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
A world filled with Technicians, lets this one, stress
Lifting, mesh kids in sets with them Tech listening vets
Expression is best written, less hidden, flesh
Women, sex driven, that's living, yes been impressed
By the way, the Tech is blessin'em
It shows
Cause the land it steady grows, and I'm the man with frantic flows
But understand he said he knows, but he ran a deadly road
But he woke up with a family rose, in a land of uncanny souls
And they adore him, even if they can't afford him
Be the rich, and be the poor then, really get to be before him
To get laced, on mistakes, and big brakes
Quick pace, lyrics they pick in this place

He played me some stuff in uh, in L.A., off "Tha Carter IV"
He has a, he has a record on there with umm
This dude named Tech N9ne I don't know if you guys heard of him?
Oh man, he's CRAZY, he's crazy

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Pain, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Am I in the Twilight Zone? Cause my mics on
But I never thought the world would buy my songs
Cause in my lane I am the highlight inside my dome
But now it's my height, they try bite, cause my life long
In this hip hop, everybody's lip drops, when I spit the
Gift quickly shifted cause I get props, it's terrific
They recognizing me on every level if ya missed it
If ya look ya findin' me on a very rebel, this is listed
Tech N9ne a insane man
His own lane had the strain and pain, and then became fans
When all the dames glance, he's doin' the rain dance
Because the whole world is 'bout to be a Strangeland

[Spoken]

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Getting paid was the game plan
But the lane transformed to untamed fans
Enhanced into Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Bane, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
Where everybody know my name man
Cause my blood and veins ran through the mainland
I am in a Strangeland
(Can't live up to them)
Bane, and insane land
(Waking up in a..)
Strangeland
