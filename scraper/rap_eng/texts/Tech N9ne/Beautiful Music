(Bang out)

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Now they wanna come with a nigga
Get to the pinnacle, get some with a nigga
Get done, get gun, get sprung with a nigga
Re-evaluate your fate, if you want monogamy then skate
You gotta let everybody get a taste and if you wanna date
You gotta wait for Mister...

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
...Yates!
I'ma put this space this place all up in your face
Picture me painting pretty pussy with a pen and pad
And picking a pair of provocative peaches to press to the pace
Let's get this straight, I am the maker of emotion on my planet
You will be blessed at the gate, complex when the mate
Is one that could have any woman breathing
So you might end up with a chest full of hate, left to debate
If women would just ride, she feeling my love vibe
I'm feeling her cup size, she willing to plug guys
I'm given her bug eyes from my dick in her thighs
She thinking it was lies
When her name changed from baby to Sherlock Holmes
When you want to shit and she go through your phone
To see if there's pictures of bitches with no clothes on
Now she pissed at the photos, looking like a ho show
Thinking every one of them are gonna get the pogo
Or prolly done had it, she highly combative
But no-no, shining the light on me with cheater up on the go bro
When we first started out you knew we was on the low-low
Now you feeling Bozo, peeping through my property like you loco
Thinking I'm sticking them and slanging more meat than Fogo

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
It's just me and you, better yet it's me and crew
'Cause I never can be free and do
What a normal nigga can manage to be when two
People go out with no doubt to show out
They beautiful couple but when I go out they pour out
And triples and doubles, then out of your mouth to blow out
'Cause you had enough of the bitches seizing who?
You saw the beautiful picture at the beginning
With Mr. Tech in your vision having sex in the kitchen
And press in the living room, sex and no less or you're bitchin'
Without extra conditions me getting left is the mission
'Cause I can't get right, ain't this night
Ain't no possible way that I can paint this bright
When the brain is night, mayne it's quite
Difficult to be with Tech, ain't a dame this tight
Or is it? You gotta live it to give it
I'm giving you me, if you wanna quit it, I dig it
'Cause I get a pussy pass every minute, but then it's
A fight 'cause you thinkin' I'm all up in it, we finished
Now we diminished, I get it
See the obstacle then you really admit it
Without knowing I ever did it you split it
I was real and don't you ever forget it
You bit-itch!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Baby, this is something that you never knew
Instead of me, you being with a regular nigga might be a better view
I know I got a lot of cheddar, true
But a nigga with hella time in your bed is who?
You should be putting way up on a pedestal
You being super happy with him instead of blue
But you wanna see shit that you never seen
My dick is feeling like you taking methamphetamine
That's why when I'm calling your phone you never let it ring
Even when he's sitting next to you I bet it sting
You wanna ride it your hide is divided
By my two thumbs, I murder it when I get inside it
Hit it 'til you get it, then get the itis ignited
When you tripping, you can't fly with the pilot?
I can paint you a beautiful picture
But I think it's better when you got a dude with you
Sitting at home, but then you got a true fixture
You fucking perform because he got it through scripture
I'm a compatible nigga to every woman with incredible figures
Tattoo my dick on him, is that a new stigma?
If you say that then music I ain't gotta do with ya

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
Now I can paint a beautiful picture
But you won't want to look into it
I can make beautiful music with ya
But you won't want to listen to it
