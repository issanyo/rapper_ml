[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I know y'all hate
But I guarantee it, y'all bitches like it nigga
Liquid Assassin, Tech N9ne
Oh I can get REAL serious, motherfucker

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
When you lookin at me
Think of a nigga that knuckled up and trigga happy
I'm serious
Throwin ya hood it be lookin like ya trippin it like it ain't all good have me
I'm serious
I'm furious
If you curious
Come to Minnesota or you can go to Missouri bitch
Hella sick and delirious
Don't you slip and come near me
It's deep and so serious (x2)

[Verse 1: Black Pegasus]
I'm serious
I excel like satellite, the radio
I'm serious
Like punching an infant, in it's baby dome
I'm serious
Like drinking 40's and popping and abuse
I'm serious
Like pointing at cops, letting them cannons shoot
My spits are hollow tips from big shottas
Can't wait for shit, I got little patience like kid doctors
Pop ya pussies and all the hymens in your squad
You don't write raps, that's the vagina monologue
Lose these beats, I got crazy bread
Your girl's on Lucy, she be giving crazy head
Tech N9ne, L.A., that's a crazy spread
We Black P, All-Stars, rip the game to shreds
Red Monkeys, and we repping it well
Drop a blunt, I'll let it fall, I ain't catching a L
You catching a shell
When I point, aim, and squeeze
I'm on top of my beat, bitch
Like a piece of cheese
I'm out for blood
When you see me, it's not a game
So tuck your chain, your dame, and your jugular vein

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
When you lookin at me
Think of a nigga that knuckled up and trigga happy
I'm serious
Throwin ya hood it be lookin like ya trippin it like it ain't all good have me
I'm serious
I'm furious
If you curious
Come to Minnesota or you can go to Missouri bitch
Hella sick and delirious
Don't you slip and come near me
It's deep and so serious (x2)

[Verse 2: Liquid Assassin]
I'm as cold as ice is
I'se is, serious when it comes to a crisis
Get yourself in a situation
You're facing no patience with a nigga with known devices
Might get on some Mike Tyson fight shit
Serious like Ike like to strike chicks
Turn a nigga into a punching bag, if you wanna step into my face and make a mistake to your life, bitch
Never back down, for my hood and my city, Cali, Minnesota to Missouri, you wanting to get at me
Clap around, show nobody won't really pull a shotty on enemies
Steady be bowing down, ain't no nigga ahead of me
My mission is to make you a mystery, history
Shit, the feeling to me is drinking like Listerine
Steady plotting, picking your package, whatever the weather be, finna bet I'm a step on your head like a guillotine
My demeanor with Tecca Nina, releasing my metal meaner, the heater and millimeters set fire to beats
And I know that I'm Madesicc, and I'm running with Strange, bitch, so hate all you want but they desiring me
It's like an automatic weapon, it's repping and stepping, cocking and loading to put a hole in a nigga with emotion
The brother with the flow and I'm showing you motherfuckers that I'm knowing I can spit it when I'm focused
Knuckle up, get to scuffling, roughing it up
Busting your head
Rumbling, fucking your face up
Fist flying like discus, sicker than sick shit
Malt liquor in a nigga, you really get banged up
Assassin's back, serious like a heart attack, with Tech N9ne (gunshot)
Give it to any one of you motherfuckers that want it
You want it? Then bitch, come get some
(Serious!)

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
When you lookin at me
Think of a nigga that knuckled up and trigga happy
I'm serious
Throwin ya hood it be lookin like ya trippin it like it ain't all good have me
I'm serious
I'm furious
If you curious
Come to Minnesota or you can go to Missouri bitch
Hella sick and delirious
Don't you slip and come near me
It's deep and so serious (x2)


[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
We shifty
Creep with the shit to make you bleed quickly
Let's not try to play me like yo Xbox 360
Secretly
Sleep with she
He's the victim, he's pissy
Tech pops, make yo chest lock, stop breathe sissy
I invented "sin and sing" grim and menacing when it's finishing things
No replenishing this means diminishing his genes
Because I put the demon in miss thing
He's a girly mind, I'm a whirly mind
Hit it and then I hurry on
Never short and pathetic he need to stop and let it be
Don't be sicking me when the girl be gone
(Nina)
Don't be looking to get at me
When ya women is wit a G nigga she give me the pussy and the head shot
If you tripping you better be hella quick and ahead of me
Got a fetish for death go make the lead pop
Gimme the motherfucking drama the Riot Maker will damage anybody with a problem solve em
Leaving niggas stuck in the winter never get to autumn
If he ain't a pussy nigga I don't know what to call em
And that's real spill
Tecca Nina and Liquid Assassin is the real deal
Yes, Tech's real ill
Quick to show a hater motherfucker how the steel feel
Listen to me hear me bust
Women and many nuts
Nigga ya actin just like a bitch on her period
Never come near me just get away from the fury of a killa city nigga
Because you know that he serious
