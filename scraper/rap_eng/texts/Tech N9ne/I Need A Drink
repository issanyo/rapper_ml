In Heaven, but the Hell still with me
Cops pull us over, yo, my name Bill Bixby
That mean in a blink, I'mma do the opposite of shrink
And bink ya, but I do not want the klink
I need a drink, vodka, cognac
Rum, whiskey, beer and tequila, I don't wanna think
I need a drink, whether wine or moonshine

[Verse 1]
Big fuckin' cup, shit's fuckin' up, this fuckin' sucks
Everybody broke cause ain't no jobs

Constantly stallin' me, (Fuck this economy)

But in all honesty, it fuckin' astonish me
When we broke, nigga, looked at as a joke, nigga
But I'm a go-getter, hop up like a four wheeler
To jack a dope dealer, run up in y'all hood
Choppin', all stood with the K 'till it was all good

Fuck sittin with nothing I ain't about to cry and gripe
Just gonna live my every day like the Mayans right
I ain't bullshitting, I'm a lost soul
My kids growing and they needin shits that cost dough
My homie got shot right outside of off four
I need the cross yo

[Outro]
I need a drink, vodka, cognac
Rum, whiskey, beer and tequila, I don't wanna think
I need a drink, whether wine or moonshine
Whatever, I'm just tryin' to ease my mind
I need a
