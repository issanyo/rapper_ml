[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Black folks forgive us, but it's merely a word
And there's a lot worse things out there then words
The bombing in Oklahoma, the kids in Colorado
So forgive us when we say shit like

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
N-I-double-G-A-S
Some of us gotta sell yay,  cess
Getting hella rilla doing they best
Player haters better wear they vest

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yo, I'ma hit a bitch from the back nigga
Quick to get stacks, spittin' facts from the track
Black maniac, opposite of whack nigga
At the nightclub full of yack nigga
Lyrically strapped wit' a gat nigga
Stand back nigga, I'm 'bout to introduce a ho nigga to a gat nigga
Track neo, 'bout ta be yo, 2K hero, we fo' below zero where we go
Come wit' the hard hits, run where the sparks lit
You niggas that start shit end up in a dark pit
Regime and vills, we kill with steel and gold grills
Exodus, Insanus, Nocturnus, never get vexxed with us
What kinda nigga is you? (I don't know)
You soft as cotton my kinda nigga is the kinda nigga
Who is equivalent to an igloo
We went from peanut butter in Benton
To Tech N9ne really spittin'
Went from the Jackson Five to George Clinton
To Bill Clinton, yey he's a nigga like us
A nigga that smokes weed and loves bitches who loves to suck
I'm a nigga that bust, I'm a nigga that cuss when I fuss
I'm a nigga that knows on this globe five hundred thou' isn't enough
I'm a nigga don't like other niggas that try to keep on a plantation
With the caucasian, beware it's the nigga invasion

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Nigga!) Do what they can to gain green
(Nigga!) Setting the trends for mainstream
(Nigga!) Gangbang
(Nigga!) Dope slang
(Nigga!) Still
(Nigga!) Ill
(Nigga!) Will
(Nigga!) Kill
N-I-double-G-A-S
Some of us gotta sell yay,  cess
Getting hella rilla doing they best
Player haters better wear they vest
N-I-double-G-A-S
Some of us gotta sell yay,  cess
Getting hella rilla doing they best
Player haters better wear they vest

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Yo, beware of us niggas, better to be scared of us niggas
We wiping away niggas who so much as glare at us niggas
I run from the law with my niggas, down with the fall with my niggas
How many of the niggas from the inner city are down to brawl with my niggas
I hang with gang bang niggas, got the niggas, you name the niggas, I got the niggas
Like Big Dog, Mac Mac, Will and Foster nigga
I run with killer niggas, then I hang with these nigga who produce thriller nigga
You know the nigga that the did the wiz color purple Q-Jay top thriller nigga
I'ma live nigga, I'ma die nigga, I'ma fly or I'ma gonna fry my nigga
If I do, if I do ya'll go to the record store and buy nigga
6, 6, triple 8, 46, 99, 3 niggas, we niggas
Getting fucked up with R to the motherfuckin' D to the V niggas
Want me to call you brother but youse a nigga like me
The ununited states gives a fuck about your Bachelors Degree
So black people if we embarrassed ya, sorry but our character is
Newly and grimed and suicidal of America nigga

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
(Nigga!) Do what they can to gain green
(Nigga!) Setting the trends for mainstream
(Nigga!) Gangbang
(Nigga!) Dope slang
(Nigga!) Still
(Nigga!) Ill
(Nigga!) Will
(Nigga!) Kill
N-I-double-G-A-S
Some of us gotta sell yay,  cess
Getting hella rilla doing they best
Player haters better wear they vest
N-I-double-G-A-S
Some of us gotta sell yay,  cess
Getting hella rilla doing they best
Player haters better wear they vest

[Outro: Tech N9ne & Don Juan]
That's right, this is for my nigga Rodney
This is for the whole motherfucking game related staff nigga
Putting it down, midwest side, nigga ride nigga
Tech N9ne, this is how we do it
Motherfucker told me it was the rider tour
Treat it like it's mandatory
You know what I'm sizzling
Don Juan takes us up out this bitch
Now look here, I done told y'all motherfuckers
We gon' do it again and we gon' do it twice
And we gon' rock this shit for the motherfucking 2K
So I want y'all to go get that motherfuckin' new album
The Calm Before The Storm on midwest side records
Tecca Nina, Don Juan, everybody
Hey, this goes to black, white, Hispanic
You know what I'm sayin', everybody
You know what I'm sizzlin'
When y'all stop shooting and killin'
Each motherfuckin' other
I'll stop saying nigga, but until then
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga please
I treat it like a fucking disease
