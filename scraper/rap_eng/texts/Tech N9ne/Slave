[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Fight the pain inside the rain
A rebel know to let the devil go
So now to get paid, 'bout to be working like a slave

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I’m kinda good, kinda bad
Kinda getting money can’t be mad
I’m kinda broke but I’m kinda rich
Wishing I had a corner I could put a bitch in
Ain’t gon' do nothing, ain’t like I’m suffering
Food for my baby mouth and I bought a house
For my baby mother and
What’s wrong? I try
Don’t matter, still die
I’m strong, but I’m not
When I’m alone I cry
Out for you is hard to do
I can’t see you, so doubt for you
And out my mouth I sprout the noose
Too much Vodka, and Mountain Dew
Blaspheming ain’t what I be meaning, if you listen fast
You’d think I was a heathen, but the last
Sunday receiving the preaching from the pastor
And I ain’t even believing the bastard
But no Hades, God’s baby
God made me a lil crazy
When I’m off I’m gone, my life is my songs
It's what I mean? When I sing "still on a wing and a prayer"
But if I listen to what was written
In the scripture maybe it’ll get me there
Share with the people I swear it isn’t evil
Scared that it might be in vain
But if I say I’m the genius, and like Jesus
Everybody gonna know my name, Kali

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on this road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace in my shelter

[Verse 2: Kutt Callhoun]
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord
I need reparations due to devastations
From the state of present situations
And it’s not easy
To walk a narrow path and mock Jesus
It’s hard when you’re family wonderin'
When you’re gonna make enough to stop leavin'
Stop breathing for a minute 'cause it’s all
Artificial when them laws tryna get you
When them haters right behind em
Wanna shove a double barrel sawed off in your dental
What can I do to stop a big catastrophe
When niggas after me and bitches after me
Wanna have my baby, missing niggas lately
Trails and tribulations tackle me
My mama think I made it, she feeling elated
Proud of her only son born
My kids think I’m the greatest, I can not display a smile
Feelin' like a Funion
Salty and all (You’ll be...)
Locked in a stall (...Tryin')
Lost in the cause (Truly no denying)
Ain’t nobody gonna do it for me
For the MO, don't let it drive me insane
Solicitation of a prostitute
'Cause you're a ho when you’re playing this game
But it’s okay I am gon ride till I triumph
'Cause everybody once upon a time was a slave
This is Calhoun

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on this road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace in my shelter

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I work, I play, and I drink booze every day
Tryna muffle the blues I'mma say
You'se in the way, fools run astray
Allah, God, Jesus, Jah somebody please help me
Mama got a problem with diabetes, it don’t seem healthy
Everything depends on Ninna
Fame hitting Dontez Senior
Gotta nigga thinking some of the fans I’m making it
Will they wanna do me like Selena
Devil laughing like a hyena
Losing all the good in my demeanor
I don’t wanna go psycho but yo the flow ya know
I got to go and Charlie Sheen ya
Tryna stay good with the old lady
My mind made her go crazy
No time for my poor babies
So don’t let a motherfucker play me
When I say FU pay me
Even though I’m getting money you can still see
I’m hungry like I’m in Haiti
What am I to do? What am I to you?
But a lot of cool? But I’m not amused?
Can’t you see? I’m stressed, not free
From y’all, I’m sick
My body’s hot, if 'n this pressure
Don’t let up, this will prolly stop for Tech Ninna

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
I’ve been working like a slave, oh Lordy
And I get tired along this lonesome journey
I done stumbled on this road, I’ve been wrong, I know
I know that there’s no peace in my shelter
