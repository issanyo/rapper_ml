J. Norm

As a soldier I just know war
From them Philly streets I know poor
Even Tech said it
“you speak your mind, or remain behind that closed door”!
P.T.S.D. I know it well, those nightmares ate my souls core
And his music was my only drive to make it through
No chauffeur
What I show for it? career stuck on the bench?
Or Forrest Go for it!
Cause when life get hot or too cold to bear it
What is yo porridge?
What is yo orbit? did you plan it? can you manage?
Do you hold storage?
Will you vanish, watching son rise? screaming Oh GOD!
Like you know Horus?
It's crazy!, these fantasizing rhymers don’t amaze me
They chained my family tree
But see my ROOTS don’t show my slavery
And I’m aging, grave shifting seeing B.I.G. and Pac ghost daily
While I'm hoping that they’ll save me
Cause society must hate me
Scared of my conscience, all my happy thoughts are monsters!
I thought I had a trophy wife, she canned me with an oscar
I’m stuck here out my noodle, no linguine, lack of posture
If you think you know a sicker soul, my pen a seal them options
