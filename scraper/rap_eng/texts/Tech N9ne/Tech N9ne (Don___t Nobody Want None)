[Intro]
Dedicated to all the DJ's and dance crews all around the world
(Tech N9ne)

[Verse 1]
Don't nobody want it, we hella hot at the moment
We're comin' for all opponents, it feel incredible don't it?
It really ain't a thang, who get 'em crazy goin' orangutan?
(Tech N9ne)
Look at 'em copy me, tryna get top of the boss with a lot of mediocrity
Stalkin' the properties, wanna get off in my monopoly
Tell me who is the one they call Chakratease?
(Tech N9ne)
It's been a wreck, been a debt
When a head-on collision was in effect from a Tech
The other side is accursed, they have a lot of 'regerts'
My creation is shakin' the planet Earth (We'll show)
Everybody better (Kneel down)
Any opposition (Will clown)
So don't you make a mistake with the Yates
Get some plan of escape - you better break!

[Hook]
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
(Tech N9ne)

[Verse 2]
The beat I broke
Never needed my chin hair to be thy goat
With the mic and my fight folks that peep my quotes
And try to say they wiggidy nice joke
(Tech N9ne)
The big man that lift hands and get fans
That pushin' the poetry big as it can
Way up on the pedestal
Losing your lesson, let's let it go
Killin' so many, I might be federal
(Tech N9ne)
Your pal, Nina
Thinkin' dirty with your style, my style cleaner
Women all on me screamin' just like I'm Alcina
Wanna go with the Scorpio, baby? I'll sting ya
Boo you, screw you too
Fool, you through
This how we do in the 'Zzou
Mizzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou
'Zzou-zzou-zzou
'Zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou

[Hook]
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Wait a minute

[Verse 3]
Now the beat will style the feet
That step into anybody faking and lay 'em down to sleep
Found a beast to give the people a sound to peep
How elite? Tecca Nina with Al Naafiysh
Yeah, another sucker lost tryna uppercut a boss
Wanna break out on me? I'mma break a motherfucker off
Thinkin' that you could handle's a gamble
We lit as a candle, damn your clan look nothing but scandal
And taking the L
You facing to fail, shakin' the whale
And you a snail awaking to hell
Baking your tail with the heat
The agony of defeat
Depravity and tragedy it had to be of a chief
See my technique and they come try to (Steal it)
But they cannot duplicate how I (Kill it)
Fakers will never compare to the (Realest)
Tech is a murderer, giving it up 'til they (Feel it)

[Hook]
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
[Scratches]
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)
Don't nobody want none (Don't nobody want none)

[Outro]
Boo you, screw you too
Fool, you through
This how we do in the 'Zzou
Mizzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou
'Zzou-zzou-zzou
'Zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou
Boo you, screw you too
Fool, you through
This how we do in the 'Zzou
Mizzou-zzou-zzou-zzou-zzou
