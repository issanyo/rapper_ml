[Strofa 1: Ceza]
Hej ti, ustani i donesi svoj mali mikrofon
Vidiš, ovde je džek, priključi ga na mikrofon
I evo ti papir i olovka, jer ću da te inspirišem
Zagušljivi cepači, lovimo neprijatelje po nebu
Ajde da krenemo, da vidimo ko će da pobedi


[Uvod]
Počeli smo u srednjem delu istoka
Sada ćemo da odemo
Preko celog sveta, cine
Da, ovo je vrhunac
Da, Tek Najn

[Strofa 2: Tek Najn]
Prati me, preko cele planete, vodim skalu bolesti
Koju nikad nisu provalili, štetimo bez izvinjenja
Smanjiti im paniku, to je manijakalno ali ja moram da budem
Mahnit, ja ću da improvizujem jer sam čudan
Dograbim numeru kao da jedem kod Mama Nakas
Mogu da te sjebem kako treba jer sam partner sa Vaka Flokom
Dajte mi vrh hip-hopa i vidite kako ih teram da rokaju
Kada se zaustavlja šou, aktivira se čakra (Svetski Cepači)
Ako si iko i išta, primetićeš
Tek je na vrhu, i niko identičan nije
Loaded cold as the polar get wrote it quick and they quoted it
Yo it exploded the flow behold it cause when the motor spit
A-bi-de-a, bi-de-a, never to get free of the real
Better ya just kneel to me or ready to get near my heels
Give me the knock and I’ma chop, he came and he went tomorrow
But I’ma lock it down and hop in the pocket like empanadas
Hit 'em up and get 'em up, I ain't done, I ain't did enough
Trip when I rip it up, I be the ish when I split em up
Sort of like I was liquored up and backing up in the gut
Everybody be knowing I be acting up when I bust
From Missouri to Canada, I be keeping the stamina
If you never been a fan of the man, the planet's unanimous
Can I cuss, fuck anybody Tech is calamitous
Leave them in the dust, ain't nobody tough when I'm standing up
Tech is hostile, he's awful
He really be wicked when he be off in the bottle
You with it, you dig it, you never lost the apostle
He's thinking he give it the Poe and toss in Picasso
Killing everybody off is the motto
And I be the only chopper that's tossed in the brothel
You said it's pathetic, my head is off in the taco
I sped and you bled and you in the coffin when I go

[Hook]
Ja sam svetlosne godine udaljen od mojih vršnjaka
Oćeš malo, dodji vamo
Nemoš' me sjebat, il' ić' oko mene
Pokloni se, krunisali su me kad su me pronašli

(K.C.)
[Verse 3: J.L.]
Check it, I'm ahead of 'em
Chop it up with the veterans
A legend developing
Ain't gotta tell him it's evident
Gotta notice an elephant
None of you niggas relevant
You're delicate, but loving every second of this

(Denmark)
[Verse 4: U$o]
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle vild "Fucking Chopper"

(Alabama)
[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
What if I ran into you with a pogo stick
Hopped up on top of you rappers like a Jehovah's Witness
With a photo of Jesus and a paper pamphlet
And I threw up more churches like I was playing Hamlet
Syllable burning, that internal damage
Swing, batter, batter, but then I lay back on a hammock
Under an oak tree, like I was peeling pecans
But instead, I'm peeling rappers' heads, making a sand-a-wich
Pick up a 22 and put a bullet inside of a
Motherfucka from inside a 1987 box
I'm headed up, yeah, headed for bucks
Fuck 'em all, make them feel my dread like I had a head of locks
Feel every bump like you had bad shocks
But I hopped on the fucking beat
And I worldwide chopped
Wanna fuck with Tech N9ne
Twist up the pine and
Smoke a beat with Mr. Busta Rhymes
Well, sure, why not?
Really don't need to show any more of my cock
But I run across the stadium in a pair of your socks
In a trench coat with the pencil and a watch
Then drop a verse before you can focus to read the clocks
Slumerican is out of control
Heat it up, beat it up, then I gotta go
But I'm a dump truck, just send another load
Peter Piper dump a pile of peppers in your throats
Wit' an alien probe

[Hook]

Twista (Chicago)
[Verse 6: Twista]
Like I gotta focus up in my rhythm or loosen the venom
And hit 'em and give 'em astig-a-ma-tism
And then I'mma spit 'em somethin' so full of vengeance
That everybody'll wanna devour the pieces of my enemies cause of cannibalism
Breaking them off into particles, they get in a predicament
That be never reversible cause a nigga be too versatile
Makin' you nervous, you could never compete with the colonel
I burn you, I'm an immortal, and that's the reason I murder you
Focus on my hocus pocus and make a likkle magic
After I wreck and check ya, then your respect I better have
Because I'm an anomaly, able to give a lobotomy
To any motherfucker challenging my astronomy
Hopping, I don’t stop with the fire when the flames thrown
I'm one of the most popular choppers and my name's known
Throwing it up in the air, takin' it there
We WWC, if you can't keep up, should've stayed home
My alien knowledge be making other astronomers'
Work look as ancient as a discovery of paleontology
So play me and I'mma be shining on them haters
I'm finna be using it as energy, watch how radiant I'mma be
Like a helicopter when the words fly
Entire families all the way out to you girl die
If I catch you fuckin' with the most intricate lyricists
Don't even try to stop us cause we choppers and we worldwide
And I'm

[Hook]

(New York)
[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
See, now they ask when I'mma stop it, my dude
And when I'ma cock it and pop it, and when I'ma drop it my dude
Inevitably, it's that I'mma be the most incredible dude
To ever spit on the record and put it together, my dude
And then they ask “what in the world is you proving
When you were already the best” and “what the hell is he doing”
Well, I'ma be chopping and cutting and breaking and beating and shaking
And fucking everything up 'til there ain't no further mistaking
And busting everything up like a fuckin' angry Jamaican
And shutting everything up, especially the ones who be hating
They loving everything until I got 'em stuttering-stupid
You hear 'em now?
“D-d-d-d-don’t do-do-do-do it
P-P-P-Please
Wh-wh-wh-why you gotta t-try us
W-w-w-w-we already know that you be the nicest”
And now I'mma come and kill 'em, get them, hit them, and finish them
And bang 'em in the head and diminish them, and then I'll
Hit 'em again at a minimum, repeat it coming to killing 'em
Then he be gotta be drilling them
Thinking “they gotta be feeling him”
Spitting lithium, see the way a nigga be spilling them
And getting them stupid to the point where there's no forgiving him
Hoping you're listening and you're paying attention
And you're witnessing the way that I be crushing the mic
And getting in the zone, I be flattening and packing in
People from the front to the back and
They got me acting a fool, I'm Black and
Nigga now I’m home

[Hook]

(Kansas City)
[Verse 8: D-Loc]
My fire annihilate make fighters retire instantly
I’m choppin' ‘em, call me Michael Myers in my vicinity
The way I be killing 'em with rhythm, it get illegitimate
The Gilla will finish any, in a predicament
Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

(California)
[Verse 9: Twisted Insane]
I hit 'em with venom when I get up in 'em
I bend em and send em and you can feel me
Digging up in your brain and bringing the pain
They often wanna kill me
Filling 'em with that fury
Get up and hurry, you can feel the Real me
Coming in with that shit, I'm having a fit, and you will never peel me
Off of you when I'm on top of you, I got the drop on you
And popping often hitting ‘em up with a bullet to the (brain)
You can look into the eyes of a heathen, breathing, you’re fiending
And dreaming to find a demon, name insane, I’m a worldwide (Chopper)
