[Intro: Tech N9ne]
The industry's a bunch of fuckin' punks!
Here's what they said:
Well, ya know Tech, your drum-n-bass might not go well with uh urban radio, ya know?
And, your orange hair, it's so.. not..
Black, I mean ya know, you understand what I'm sayin'?

[Collision: Krizz Kaliko]
F-U-C-K Y-O-U
F-U-C-K Y-O-U
F-U-C-K Y-O-U
F-U-C-K Y-O-U

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Yo.. yo.. check.. check..
Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real, and even think his own thoughts
Everybody wanna do what everybody else do
When the "copycat" is what they been taught
I'ma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain, and I'ma give it to the rap game
The way you're doin' it, the way you're pursuin' it
You're gonna ruin the feelin', it's a goddamn shame
Are you ready for the real? Here we go now
Most on the radio can't flow now
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another Pac or an O-Town
We can't have a contest or a showdown
With two guys got the same kinda flow sound
Tecca Nina; I'm comin' to put the mo' down
Run up in the record label with the fo' pound
Am I too versatile? Cursed to drown in the bowels of the Earth
When I'll be first to growl, and burst out the fouls
Of the original murderous verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one winnin' the race
That's real, I'm speakin' to everyone in the place
I can deal what ya don't like; the drum and the bass
If you can deal with a motherfuckin' gun in your face
I can't get wit' it
Record labels in the industry are sick wit' it
P.D.'s that really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch - if you diss my hit, you might get pistol-whipped
Catch him in the hall - hit 'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans, they can get it all
'Cause the industry is punks! - check I'm ready to get crunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
How many 2Pac's and Jay-Z's and Master P's can they conceive?
Don't they know a few Glocks, 380s, and Master Keys'll make 'em bleed?
How you gonna say
Black people won't listen to this and don't listen to that?
Like sayin' a fool can slang 'caine
A fool can gangbang but never will get hit with a gat?
You better - get your story straight
'Cause I ain't no devil for real - I'm a rebel for real
That Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You a pebble to real niggas - songs like "Psycho Bitch" and "Real Killa"
"Einstein", "Niggas" after mill still-a
The idiots say black folks won't feel us
What you think we dumb?
Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showin' original tongue, it'll be fun
But the motherfuckers with the bums and the weak ones
Suge Knight punked the industry quick
That's because most the industry's bitch!
Nigga I'm a man, I don't be runnin' from nobody
We deal with the niggas who trippin' and givin' us shit
Radio won't play the Unk Fay
Thought they wanted rap to advance but they Ont Day
When I die I'ma aunt hay
Every industry's rackin 'em, givin money to the Unk Pay
Tech and Technico, dead peo-ple, involved from K.C. to Mex-i-co
Strapped with that fat Desert Eagle
Run up on the industry and let the heat go!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
You can look into my E-Y-E's and you can see why these
Motherfuckers don't wanna see my steez
'Cause I'm a killa with lyricals comin' down like miracles and
I come from a kingdom of humble drums and hums become rumbles
I'm the one that begun the gun tongue
Get sprung, now everyone comin' in bundles
Act like a bitch; treated like a bitch
Act like a chump; treated like a chump
When the funk jump - what ya gonna want?
Ain't gon' want nothin' - industry punk
You can run but you can't hide from the riot
So you can say that it's dope but I won't buy it
You can think Tech N9ne really won't fly
But I got a killa ear and a killa eye
Def Jam take chances; in my opin-ions
They give advances; to the niggas that's really on
Universal, Loud, LaFace - that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots; most of 'em on some heinous shit
That other shit; call your mother, sis, or ya brother bitch
Not no lover licks, packin' black and fat, blubber shit
Yeah the radio dead! - 'cause the industry is punks! (punks!)
Put the double-barrel to his forehead!

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one
They won't play me on - radio, 'cause they be on
Punk shit daily y'all - industry's a shady one

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Now that's absolute power bitch, that's real shit
We ain't kissing no motherfuckin' ass to be accepted
Open your mind motherfuckers
Hear some new shit, you know what I'm sizzlin'?
Tech N9ne
