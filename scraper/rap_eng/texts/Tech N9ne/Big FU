[Verse 1]
I don’t even see any one of us changin
The more I wish for, the more stays the same
If everybody did me right it’d be amazing
I pray about it, feels like it's in vain

[Bridge]
I got a big stage to play for, really know what I came for
I’m too big to be ignored, thank God I’m still employed
Tattoos say love me, but I think it don’t
So I pour Hennessey down my throat, to forget about it

[Chorus]
I don’t really know how to be real, no
I keep burning this candle at both ends, can't handle it
What am I to do, you can’t help me, it’s a big FU
Cause I keep wishing for more, can’t be ignored
Too real for TV, I can’t say no more
What am I to do, no you owe me B-I-G F-U

If I get up from here, you better run, you better run
If I get up from this chair, you better move, you better run

[Verse 2]
Now I’m the only one out here that’s crazy
Walk a mile in my shoes, you’d feel the same
I go through this life with a big chip on my shoulder
If you ever stepped on me, you made me that way

[Bridge]
I got a big stage to play for, really know what I came for
I’m too big to be ignored, thank God I’m still employed
Tattoos say love me, but I think it don’t
So I pour Hennessey down my throat, to forget about it

[Chorus]
I don’t really know how to be real, no
I keep burning this candle at both ends, can't handle it
What am I to do, you can’t help me, it’s a big fuck you
Cause I keep wishing for more, can’t be ignored
Too real for TV, I can’t say no more
I forgive what you do, no you wronged me B-I-G F-U

If I get up from here, you better run, you better run
If I get up from this chair, you better move, you better run

[Verse 3]
They tell me it's about the way that I done made
Understand the booty you and I have ate
See I party, cause my heart aches

[Chorus]
I don’t really know how to be real, no
I keep burning this candle at both ends, can't handle it
What am I to do, you can’t help me, it’s a big FU
Cause I keep wishing for more, can’t be ignored
Too real for TV, I can’t say no more
I forgive what you do, no you wronged me B-I-G F-U

If I get up from here, you better run, you better run
If I get up from this chair, you better move, you better run
