Yeah, stadium is shaking, they can feel it 'round the nation
Cause the plays we making got the opposition pacing
When my team awakens, you're facing annihilation
We put down a demonstration, you should've stayed on vacation
When you think you got it, then we show you that you're not it
You're gonna find defeat wherever KC has a spot in
We're gonna run you down if you bring it to us, and we win
