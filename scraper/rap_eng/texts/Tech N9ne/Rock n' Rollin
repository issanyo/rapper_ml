[Hook]
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

[Verse 1: M.I.M.S.]
I am like the Eagles, I am like the Beatles
If music is the heroin then I am like the needle
And you are Black Sabbath, too paranoid
On the dark side of the moon like Pink Floyd
If writing is a weapon, all my gun shoots is Led Zepplin
Sex Pistols’ll whip you, show respect like Otis Redding
Bring me back to life like Evanescence, you beggin’
Me? I cause hysteria, I am Def Leppard
My mind is Disturbed, you cannot dissect it
I deliver mayhem, the music is my method
I am Van Halen, eruption
Plus I got a healthy appetite for destruction, let’s go

[Hook]
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

[Verse 2: M.I.M.S.]
You find me at Linkin Park, with Motely Crue
You say you know the what, but you do not know The Who
Pay attention, you can miss it if you Blink 182
And me, I’m the one, just like I’m U2
Unforgettable fire, burning like The Wailers
My life’s a motion picture and this is just the trailer
My suits a perfect fit like it's tailored
Fuck her like an animal, I’d Nine Inch Nail her
That’s how I came into the game, and now she’s pregnant
So this is why I’m Red Hot, like the Chili Peppers
And this is why I rock, and this why I’m rollin’
Like a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

[Hook]
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
Flow so cold that why I’m so frozen
Rock n‘ Rollin', Rock n’ Rollin'
I’m a Rolling Stone with my Guns n’ Roses

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Some say I have Bad Brains, that im out of my mind now
So when I open The Doors in my head royalty Shine+down
And Motorhead spit in a mean way
Momma I kill a man like Queen say
Rush to the bank, it was a Journey that was never concerned of me
‘cause money make it a Green Day
Tecca Nina make it to the grip spot
They lookin at me waving a Slipknot
I get the trip and they go and call The Police and now there’s a Warrant for my arrest ‘cause I flipped out
When the show they wanna, hate me beat me, so I said kiss my AC/DC
That’s anus colon dookie chamber, so they tase me heat me
Now I’m a Quiet Riot in the pen, Heaven knows when I get out
There’s gonna be a hit out, watch me Avenged Sevenfold
It was all a dream, when I woke up I was torn, I dreamt sickness
No Stone Temple Pilot, giving me Korn or Limp Bizkit
