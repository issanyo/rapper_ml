[Intro: Kutt Calhoun]
To all my listeners out there
This your boy, Kut Calhoun
And this song here is about my life
It can be about your life
What people have to say about, they won't let you live your life
Here's what I think

[Verse 1: Kutt Calhoun]
My pants is saggin', braided hair
People stare but I don't care
It's the life that I choose to lead
I'm who I choose to be
And who are you to be abusing me?
With your hypocritical, stereotypical slanders
"Oh! he's a thug he must sell drugs at random"
Just because I'm a young black brother I gotta slang dope
And disrespect black mothers? Nah!
I'm a king for a queen on a quest to ball
I'm the spleen in a man and threat to y'all
I'm black, strapped and packed with intellect and all
I'm what you call your worst nightmare [?]
'Cause I don't walk around with a happy face
I got a face stressed, and feed mouths, I ain't livin' in Happy Days
So you can say what you wanna
I'm still gon' be the same ol' me in the mornin'
(Know why?)

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho)
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho-oh)
Here's my chance to make you feel what I feel if it's real
Move on and god bless the child that can hold his own

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Now everybody got something to say 'bout who I be fuckin'
The pills that I'm popin' "Just tone it down okay"
Since everybody wanna open their mouths (surprise)
I got a big dick for her, swallow this and get outta (my life)
Instill it in your head and learn, it's just me!
I never cared to share concerns about what y'all doin'
Who y'all hanging with, who y'all screwing
Why y'all ain't legit, leave me alone
If I wanna bone every grown woman in the city, then it's on!
You ain't gon' stop it, I'm a grown ass man
Doing mine with the ecstasy, I'm still gon' pop it
Let a nigga live or give a nigga room
Got a complicated life that's too troublesome for you
So if I'm on the edge, then let me get it right
'Cause regardless what you sayin' at the end of the night it's still

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho)
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho-oh)
Here's my chance to make you feel what I feel if it's real
Move on and god bless the child that can hold his own

[Verse 3: Kutt Calhoun]
Tell me:
You ever been with a relative or a friend
That be tellin' you how to live, really jealous of how you live?
Tryna down you? Look at the people around you
Point who they are
You tell em' to get some business and stay the fuck outta yours
'Cause half of they lives ain't right, and fucked up more
Shit! Half of them probably can't fight behind closed doors
But they always bringing up these stories
'Bout the shit they done did
Thinkin' they gon' get some glory

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
I never let em' get the best of me or stress me
All I wanna do is live my life
But people tend ta wonder if something is under
Deep, so bring the light
So if you a fo, we can throw, we can go
Personal info don't let everybody know
I like to keep it low who I hoe when I roll
So don't you put your nose straight through the front door
And stay outta

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
My life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho)
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho-oh)
Here's my chance to make you feel what I feel if it's real
Move on and god bless the child that can hold his own
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho)
It's my life, (life, ho) it's my life (life, ho-oh)
Here's my chance to make you feel what I feel if it's real
Move on and god bless the child that can hold his own

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, said it's my life
Up under the sun wrapped up in the one, yeah
You ain't gotta deal with it, just let me live it
It's my life
