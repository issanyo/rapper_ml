[Intro]
And I want the congregation to check yourself
Watch who you worship, watch who your children praise!
Like your so-called hometown hero Tech N9ne
That boy ain't nothing but the devil, can I get an amen?
You know I'm right about it
He ain't nothing but a devil boy!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Who the hell is Satan? And why I gotta be him?
I ain't worshiped nathan, so why you gotta see him?
When you look at me, is it the imagery?
It's gotta be god-l-y, evil's not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of Girbaud and Kangols, the ho's still dangle
I chose the angle of souls who tangle
With foe's those who stain your brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like, hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life, shit is fuckin' tight
But some people think it's an evil experiment
Some people is fearin' it, those who do Beatles is hearin' it
Sincerity is neezle sin
People who look and never listen
They thinkin' that I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life story's quite gory, spittin' even if it is rude
So ain't no brimstone, I ain't no Jim Jones
So put your grins on, listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics verbal gymnastics
You call me Lucifer, go to hell you bastard

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hot Christians, pop my disc in
Stop the dissin', squat and listen
I never say hail Satana
I'll never bail out and sell out and sell gay drama
Hey mama, they trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleasers, rip it and write heaters
Niggas that ain't pleased, with quickness are light readers
I said Anghellic, then let the man sell it
I let the fans smell it, then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me that's JCOR
They thought I'd crumble while it's rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum, we playas go get some sprayers
And hits 'em with layers of slayer inscriptions
That means God be with you, we split dude then hit you
With pistols whip you then giggle never dissing Nizzle again
I talk about the rain, I talk about the sun
I speak about the pain, I speak about the fun
I'm sayin' that I'm bad, I'm sayin that I'm good
I'm saying this to the suburbanites and every hood
Y'all act like I'm sayin' (I love Lucifer, I will kill all of you)
Motherfucker I ain't step into the lime light
To devil worship in front of kids, get your mind right

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
They call me devil boy, but I don't like that
Those who recite that, that's where the fights at
'Cause I'm a tight cat, who hella write rap
Even a slight crack, and I'll be right back
To devil worshipers at my signings thinkin' I'm gnarly (huh)
I just wanna go to your parties
So I can run through all your goth bitches, and rock bitches
Take 'em on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror, got archives I'm sure you
Got hard lives, Missourah is our side
And it's hella depressin', hella a stressin'
Retrogression back to depression, a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick, don't respect poor pricks
Who listen to this album and then say exorcist
You dense, hence the word 'Ang' it means good
'Hellic' it means bad, you didn't catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it (rebel toys)
Tried to explain now I say fuck it (several ploys)
Foolish title I can't touch it (devil boy)
'Cause I talk backwards (suseJ sevol uoy)

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick, and on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
'Cause I am not the everyday, I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me, yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell
