[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
(Big gasp) I feel like I'm about to throw up (ugh!)
Gang signs cause I'm kixin' it! (oh)
Guess I never grow up. security! ease up, let a big star enter
I just want to drink and flirt with the female bartender
Kixin' it, You up tight but I'm in a loose mood
Mixin' it, not much ice its a vodka and juice booze
Mixin' it, which one might be the vodka and boose boose
Fixin' it, my home slice yellin out 'coose dude'
Heh, dont do the same old two step throw it up I want to see what city you in
Dancin with a beezy, got my hands where the cushion at
Yellin at the squares 'what the hell is you lookin at?'
Booty I'm gripsin' it, know that I'm gonna be twistin' it
Never could tell me to cool it because I'm a villain and baby we kixin it!

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm cleaned up, my greens up, I'm teamed up
Ya team must be steamed up because we kixin' it
We got the liquor in the door we mixin' it
We lettin everybody know we hate fakes, frauds, false, foes
We dont want to see 'em. we let everybody know we kixin' it
We got the liquor in the door, we mixin it
Come on everybody ooohh!

[Verse 2: Ron Ron]
Kicken its automatic once I bit into this tablet probably never quit kicken it 'till I kick my drinking habit
I doubt it will ever happen but never is what you never say
Matter of fact I haven't had a drink well since yesterday
My diction's a lil slurry and visions a lil blurry
Stomache bubbling a lil bit, chickens a lil curry
The club fin to close so sippen this in a hurry
And plus I'm temporarily fixing to getting married
The party's in the parking lot, looming the mac world
Sobered up and noticed I was stroken on a fat girl!
Ohh ohh no no Santa Clause please say it ain't so!
But I'm still in to kick it though, cup empty get some more
Say I shouldn't drink and drive, I party at the liquor store!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Popper]
Dun Dealer, Tech N9ne, Ron Ron, got these chicks waving they hands in the air like they pom-poms
Pop the military mind it but I'm calm niggers ask for a little bit of war but I'm nam
Hit the club for an hour then I'm gone to the after party twenty missed calls from von-von
I'm on some shit way over your head, swear to don if I get pissed I'm probally goin faaade
We's big time, you's hardly major. we spot bad chicks and fill em up with party favors
Yeah all the haters we skrillin get stilla grit. get an empty cup and fill it quick
'Till its six in the morn, in the tel, killen slit lay my perpes, till the day I die who spit it real as this

[Hook]
I'm cleaned up, my greens up, I'm teamed up
The tea must be steamed up because we kixin' it
We got the liquor in the door we mixin' it
We lettin everybody know we hate fakes, frauds, false, foes
We dont want to see 'em. we let everybody know we kixin' it
We got the liquor in the door, we mixin it
Come on everybody ooohh!

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Take yo phone an shine your light an with your left cause te liquor id in your right hand
Put your phone up, turn your cup up. grap a lady put your hand right on her butt
Now squeeze it squeeze it come on squeeze it squeeze it
Thats your gal now ya'll can go on home and lay that ass on the couch and get your bone on
