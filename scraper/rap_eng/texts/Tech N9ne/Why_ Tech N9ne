[Intro]
Hey nigga check this shit out
Show these motherfuckers why they call you Tech N9ne

[Verse]
What nigga wanna bust, what?
Nigga wanna tangle with us?
Who wanna fuck with Midwest Records?
Quick death, meet yours
So grab your piece, better yet call 9-11
‘Cause it’s murder when I tip with Rogue Dogs straight from cinco-7
Anything goes, if anything blows up and they gotta go straight through us
Punishment for those who go through hoes
Who don’t know? Nigga I told you
Pistol whackin, ain't no jackin Tech and Crazy D
Fuck a nigga, buck a nigga
When they wanna get a piece of a native Amerikilla
For real a gorilla like me
