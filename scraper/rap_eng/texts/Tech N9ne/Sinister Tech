[Intro]
You're the one nigga who's a dumb nigga
And a bum nigga, you're a slum nigga
Better run nigga when I come nigga
With a gun nigga you're a bitch
Buck you, never trust you

Better start runnin' or bust like a cannon
Cause I'mma leave hella destruction
Mental breakdown and famine
I would advise you not to slide through
Cause I will oblige you
With a rhyme flow that will demise you
How can I bow down
To a broke rapper with a foul sound? (bitch)
How can I flow rounds
With an MC that can't chow down?
Where would you be if you did't copy off me lil' boy?
This type of shit that I enjoy

Bitch flows, punk foes
Sluts hoes, case closed

Swine and lard vinegar, rhyming hard blimisher
Realistic, hedonistic
Killer with a vengence breathing this shit
Your whole facad's punkish
I'll make you kneel before Zod
Biblical hits, flippable kickable spits
Niggas with critical lyricals, never no mythical shit
Step into the evil fickle abyss
Wiggle in pittifulness
Swivel this and get pistol whipped
It's been a long ride
Tecca Nina just won't die ei ei ei eiya
Better feel it when I drill it (trick)
Real is when I kill it (Mitch)
Hit it, hit it
Never ever tell a millimeter killer

Hungry like an Ethiopian, living off the blood in your veins
