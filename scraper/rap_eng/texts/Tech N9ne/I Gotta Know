I Gotta Know
CHORUS (Red Foo) x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

Verse 1 (Figgkidd)
Now lady listen to me, its getting necessary
I'm not talking mentally, I'm talking sexually
I wanna fondle with every crack and crevice
You know who I am, so how you dancin ain't a service
It's simply the fact that you up to actin like u mine
Coz I rap and Figg up in the club with TECH N9NE
Now whether or not my first album is hot
I'm gettin women's attention as soon as the shit drop
OOOWWWW
I don't do this 'hip hop'
I'm rock star material, smashin stage props
I'm lost within reason that's why you pleased to meet me
And when I step in your region you only meetin to please me' right??

CHORUS x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

Verse 2 ( TECH N9NE)
If you want it you gotta, come to the tele with me
Spit, rum on your belly quickly, sip some til you tell me quit me
And my hormones, more on, than four zones, ignore phones
Reachin for sore bones
Skip the jeffin lift your dress and come excite me, bite me
Hop in the Jacuzzi and get hyphy, might be
Doing my thizzle, X ignites me, psyche
Strip me from my t-shirt to my Nikes
Let me slow it so you know that I really mean this
English, fiendish, dream this, bring this
Tunnel cream lipstick, stop your trippin
Cause the Tecca Nina's cunnilinguistic
I gotta know if you're my hoe
If you're my friend, if you're my foe
And don't tell me it's gonna cost me
Cause I'mma playa off in the club with Lui and my homie Figg
And yes I'm kickin it with the Aussies, I gotta know

CHORUS x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
Is this for real
Is this a game

BRIDGE (FIGG and Red Foo)
I think I'm lovin it
Coz you hot and bubblin (OOHHH)
I know you're hustling (ON THE FLOOR)
So now I'm wonderin (WHAT YOU WANT)
If you wanna be with me (YOU KNOW THAT)
You gotta sip the D (OOWWWW)
I-C-K you see (OHHH)
So come and play with me

Verse 3 (FIGG)
Now every single minute and second
Tech and Figg are left to inspect the opposite sex
Yo that's when I get
In situations I hate, coz then I can't be debating
Topics on maybe you not coming coz I got 2 Asians waiting lady?

CHORUS x 2 (blended with BRIDGE)

BRIDGE x 1
I think I'm lovin it
Coz you hot and bubblin (OOHHH)
I know you're hustling (ON THE FLOOR)
So now I'm wonderin (WHAT YOU WANT)
If you wanna be with me (YOU KNOW THAT)
You gotta sip the D (OOWWWW)
I-C-K you see (OHHH)
So come and play with me

CHORUS x 2
I gotta know
Are you my dame
