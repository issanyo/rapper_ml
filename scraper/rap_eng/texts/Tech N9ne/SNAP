[Intro: Tech N9ne]
What the Hell is going on?
Everything is going wrong
Too much shit to deal with
I'm ready to snap
Tired of getting the short end of the stick motherfucker

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
And I'm back to the drama, yes that karma
Double back and slap me without armor
Troubled cats and I'm right back torn
And a lovable act extracting at y'all
Give me a reason why this season is ceasing a sin season of grieving
I grim greed and the speeds of our fans feeling us
Everybody around me downs me and it astounds me profoundly
Whether they hound me or clown me tryna keep my mind calm
But I keep six soundly around me all through my town and your county
But I hit that ground 'cause I found I'm a walking time bomb
I feel like a fucking maniac, in public
When I flip the zaniac, they love it, nigga this ain't acting
When I'm full of money nigga this ain't happening
When your dream boat sails away you just sob
Get a regular job and start robbing
Crazy when losing your lady your heart hardens so
I'ma keep it insane with my 30 thousand dollar chain
And use it as bait for niggas who hate and wanna resurrect Samhain
Out of a sick nigga, with a short end of a stick I'ma stick niggas
Cap peela, you don't want me to be that when I snap, nigga

[Hook]
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate

[Verse 2: Liquid Assassin]
Fuck you I hate you, you fake think you way cool
Mistakes you gon' make you gon' pay with your face too
In case spray you lay you on pavement and shake you
From bullets that break you and take you to angels
You know I'm gon get cash, I know that you spit trash
Collide with you quick crash, I box with you fist fast
I'm not what you think that, I won't get the clips back
I don't hesitate to grab the gun and pop
Like Tecca Nina my guns go (chyo)
GP comin' through, nigga what you gon do
When I come into the room, gun aimin' at you
Click boom, you don't wanna see your way to the tomb
When I come in with a crew, let's play with them too
Liquid Assassin, I'ma ride for mine
Bitch ass nigga, I'ma die for mine
I'ma grab the heat and I'ma pop the iron
Put two to your chest and one to your mind
Ain't nobody getting the best of me
I put you through more pain than pregnancy
I don't really give a damn, what sex it be
Still catch a red beam, when my tech release
You don't want me to even cock the clip, bro
Like a toilet bowl come and drop a shit load
Slide to your pad and I'm creepin' tip-toe
Grip, cock back, let the clip go!

[Hook]
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate

[Verse 3: Killa C]
These boys are sick, these boys are foul
Wanna lay face down, just ask me how
If you piss me off homie, then it's straight fuckin' over
'Cause my trigger finger twitchin' and i'm far from sober
I ain't gon' stop, it just ain't in me
Even if to prison is right where they send me
I'll slide right in, hollow tips in my clip
I'm let them ride out, unless you give me my shit
Stressin' with my Wesson, I'm gon' teach you a lesson
When I come through and rob you, consider it a blessing
Suck my dick, bitch, 'cause I hate you like a motherfucker
At your front door, 'bout to make your mother suffer
Phone cords and ropes, pistols and gauges
The world wants us dead locked away in them cages
We came and we conquered, we got what we wanted
Years from now they'll say that your house is haunted

[Hook]
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate
One, two, GP's comin for you
Three, four, Tecca's at your door
Five, six, got guns and clips
Seven, eight, they sealed your fate
