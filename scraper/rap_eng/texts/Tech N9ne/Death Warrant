[Verse 1: Sadistik]
Marijuana that I light when I’m alone
Reaching ultraviolet heights to kill the spiders in my skull
I'm a recluse, reçue, hiding in my home
M. Bison when I light up, doing spirals when I roam
With the buffalo, puff of smoke, get stigmata
Buffalo Soldier, dreadlock Rasta
I'm with the vultures, get some drama
Don’t believe in karma, head shot (BLAT BLAT)
Two can keep a secret if one of them is dead
Oh there’s three left in the chamber with the gun against the head
Russian roulette, one of ‘em’s left
Left wondering, "Was it something I said?"
These motherfuckers run for cover when I hum a number
Something other, muttered thunder, hunger
For the blood of others, hunting, Hunter S
Junkie huffing puffing, under stress like gutter slug
With nothing but a stuttered des-tiny
Tiny ants dance beneath this giant’s feet
Rival me and get the iron lung for irony
Ire breeds, I am me, Ayatollah fire breathes
From the mouth of madness
Michael Myers when the smiles cease, idling
They talk shit on Wi-Fi bout the best
But their fingers stick to text nine times out of ten
Yeah, watch 'em die by fountain pen
A pound of flesh, and it better not be counterfeit

[Hook: instrumental break 8 measures]
Die, die, die (x2)

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
You think you can take me? Well, come on with it
I'm a sick, twisted fuck, I leave you tormented
So if you got a weak stomach then you better forget it
I'm a shark, I smell blood, it's too late to forfeit it
Deading y’all niggas is what I do for a living
And I'ma leave a scar so you never forget it
Have you dripping out of windows, while we robbing your credit
Run it by me, you won't be able to walk to the clinic
I'm a pathologist, Dr. Kevorkian
Nigga, I promised this, the Hip Hop scorpion
I turn all y’all kids into orphans then
Raise them as my own, shit that’s better off for them
I know I'm going to the place that's too hot for me
Cause I'm a fallen angel, something in me gots to sink
Ain't no way in hell I'm not top of the ten
If I'm not number one, I must be zero then
You dead in my sights, it's over once I zero in
Dead to rights for try'na be a hero again
Time to sign your death warrant, nigga hand on a pen
Put your best foot forward, take it on the chin
Plus whenever I'm on track pain get inflicted
Punchlines hit your head, your brain gets shifted
I'm vicious, have you screaming, “Abort the mission”
Relentless, I like to see you hurt, that's sadistic

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ahga beeba fee a lotta booby
Dada boba shabaland who be hotta? not a man!
Who ever think different's in lala land
Allah crammed scholar and a lot of K.O.D
Inside of my knot then bada bam
Strange Music, my gang ruthless we Bang you if
Lame stupidness out ya fangs true is the pain you get
From brain shoe kicks my aims lucid my name shoot this thang
Hang nooses we flame crew it's no dang blue shit!
Sick with Sticky and Sadistik suddenly something shifted
Simple Simon suckas seemin' submissive
See us and some surely substitute sis's
Chakratease spit shit psycho scripts is scripted syphilis!
You haters don't ride on my dick but yo mamma there
She like to play in my goat she call it Osama hair!
So now you wanna go get yo llama pair and shoot me
I'll die cause my insurance was fucked up by ObamaCare!
