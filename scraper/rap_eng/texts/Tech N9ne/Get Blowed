[Intro: Conversation]

[Verse 1]
The definition of blowed is indo, by the load
Chronic munchies got me on the commode
When I unload, let's role
Cloudy, outie like I'm on Maui Wowie
Zowwy sparkers on me homie
This weed is like Nakatomi on me
If you want it, you can have it be that
Hundred sacks and nut sacks
Plus fat splats from flesh gats
Only hay wastin', we both high
This is game so let me tap into your horny Playstation
I'm Tecca, so I wrecka of course
Happy like I won the super-trifecta divorce
Fuck whenever, cause I'm hella-hella
Lifted, I'm hella-hella, chronic, hella sonic
It's like I take a hit of hydro-ponic, ironic
Not Atlantis but I'm here to remind you
That I'm on cannabis, alcove without a turn of alto, Groucho
Unless I get some Biancas to let me give 'em something
To open they mouth for, bounce yo
Fat ass, to the rhymes I flow
My beats pound for blocks, from Grand View to Granot
Let's get wicked like mixin' liquor like dark rum and gin
Faded fuckin' on the only pile of twiny twin twin

[Chorus]
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes

[Verse 2]
Let's, roll to a spot, where cops don't flock
We can all get our sex on, and smoke pot
Talk of bendin' the reefa, you can leave it with beaver
Because I'd rather be fuckin' smokin' Hawiian sativa
Comprende? Even when we're in L.A hellacious
Bags ya bud, when you go grecious gracias, senior
This is bomb C4, me gone, if the bud is fire, say "Yes, Simon"
On that 151 Rum liquor
And plus that lime green sticky shit be's a kicker
It makes me wanna roll bud, roll bud
And fuck a bitch with no rub, no rub
Psyched you, when it sikes you hype you pipe to lighter
Might ignite, a snipe to swipe a viper
Only when you dip it in wet
But the only wet I'm dippin' in is vaginas
If it don't smell like salmon
Crockets, I'm in the zone, passed gone
Beatrice if you comin' bring ya silly ass on, lash on
Leave Mitch behind, he's pissed at mine
Cause I'm nice, plus I am cold as ice

[Chorus]
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes

[Verse 3]
You hoes token butts, cho's chokin' nut
So go soak in ya pity you mo smokin' slut
Greed, another devious seed
Niggaro nigga don't you know
I stick many 'iancas up pussy stampede
It's, who? This, packin' poison mistics dick
For ya no good, freak piece of trick bitch to get with
Got a peak, and the dick
Now the bitch don't really wanna give me none
That's cool, punk bitch
That's why you minimum wagin' it, bitch stuck at Cinnabun
Who's this, twisted clique in your face, motherfucker
You's a sucker if you touch us, we brothers, we straight ruckus
With Nina nigga, we 'bout to get blowed
And roll to a spot with plots to fuck hoes

[Chorus]
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes, 'ianc
Let's get drunk, get blowed
Nigga roll to spot with plots to fuck hoes
