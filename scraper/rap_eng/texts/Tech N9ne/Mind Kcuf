[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
It's too many wanna be loved
I just wanna kcuf and get up
Don't gotta tell me what you're thinkin', 'cause I know just what you're thinkin'
She light to me with a sign up
She just wanna get mind kcuffed

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Hey, new pic through, my twit view
Had me wishin' I was next to you to sniff you
So the fact I never met you was an issue
It's true so I'm hopin' it's a get to
You baby what I am creating hope it lifts you
To where you never need a tissue
Just a wet towel when I see it's somethin' I wanna lick boo
Like your eyelids..
Lot of beautiful parts of your body baby this is my bid
Have you trippin' about the freaky shit I did
You're interacting with the poet and porn hybrid
Lickin' things on your body, that they prolly
Never thought of servicin' but romancin's my hobby
I'll lick you like a lolly, from your eyes and I'll leave
Your teeth in my sweet with my tongue like it was Molly
Hella beauty wake the N9ne up
When you share pretty pictures of your fine butt
Had a dream I bit your neck and red wine gushed
So I sipped you every time I eat the prime cut
Wanna take you to a spot, no one'll find us
Be secluded, we gettin' zooted, we design lust
You submissive with mental misses and I'm what?
Super dominant, get your ankles, wrist and mind kcuffed

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Con-trol, something's wrong with me
I just can't let, go
Let me, let me see how far that you'll go
I got control of yo body
Now let me kcuf your mind, let me kcuf your mind
Mind kcuf!

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I tongue the inside of my mouth all day
So, by the time I get to you it'll be all play
Dancin' my tongue around where your pink drawers lay
We freaks but you creep's y'all wanna peek y'all pay
Yeah-e-yeah, a little bit of crazy there
She will be my lady if she don't look away
She will see my shady stare
Trying to hold your brain hostage
So you listen to every single thing I talk miss
Like "Let me hit it from the back in a crowded mosh pit." People peepin' what we doin', think we lost it
Hope you thinkin' what I'm sayin' isn't awkwid
And you ain't trippin' off of me 'cause you a boss bitch
I wanna take a dip in all your sauces
Don't be cautious, I wanna eat you 'til I'm nauseas
Can I suck your tongue? (Let me do it)
Can I touch your buns, when you push your gun in a lustful sprung (Ooh)
With a thrust so hung, I'mma crush yo lungs (Yeah!)
You still reading? I'm hoping for a response this evening, I'm teethin'
I'm hopin' your picture is not deceivin'
'Cause jeez when I look at your body girl you're not even a vegan
Please direct message me
We try at best and then we die in ecstasy
I request that you mesh with me
See why it catches me, she fly as heck to me
I'm the kind that really wants to control your brain
Wanna lock you up in chains
Give you this pain when you feel every fuckin' thing

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Con-trol, something's wrong with me
I just can't let, go
Let me, let me see how far that you'll go
I got control of yo body
Now let me kcuf your mind, let me kcuf your mind
Mind kcuf!
Cuff you like the police, something's wrong with me
I just can't let, go
Let me, let me see how far that you'll go
I got control of yo body
Now let me kcuf your mind, let me kcuf your mind
Mind kcuf! (x2)

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
I ain't playin' wit'chu, not even a little bit (No-uh)
I ain't playin' wit'chu, not even a little bit (No-uh)
We gon' see, she gon' do it
Kcuf!
