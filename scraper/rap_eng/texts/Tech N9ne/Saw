[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Yeah
From KC to Buffalo baby
They been waiting on this
Fal$e Profit$ Coalition and Tech N9ne
Cheah, cheah!

[Hook x2: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]
If this is how you want it, this is how you get it
Kick it raw, keep it hard
Make sure they won't forget it
If this is how you want it, this is how you get it
Bring the saw out the shed
And leave 'em well beheaded

[Verse 1: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]
Like reporters in Iraq, like these snorters out my sack
We peaceholders who strike back
Even harder than a guitars and it's type track
Fuck jaguars I bite cats, 151's my night cap
Get the saw out the shed and leave 'em well beheaded
Like a chicken flipping the beats over the back into the skins I'm hittin', wrapping up my doggy dog before I dipping your dirty kitten, I gotta take you out the game
Gotta show you what the deal is
Sorry if I made you lame
Broke your heart, hurt your feelings

[Verse 2: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]
You can catch me making moves like a gypsy
Need a fix player just hit me, my mission strictly
Make my palms green like Bill Bixby
Smoke trees like some hippies
Just tell me where the bricks be
I can load the throw away get dressed and be there in a [?]
Rolling in a '89 on a 90 about 60
In a fleetwood mac [?] wondering where Stevie Nicks be
I love the way she licks me, she makes me cum quickly
Imma hit this slickery tire and go smoke a zip with Ricky

[Hook x2: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]

[Verse 3: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition (Tech N9ne)]
Like John Walshes kid (Yo that's dirty Voodoo)
I don't give a hooter hollarin'
Do you? I bring these dollars in
Screw you on a deal, steal your mill
Trick you up like Copperfield
Keep it real, pop your seal and stash your milli-on
I swim with sharks like elli-on, I'm in there like swimwear
Make sure they [?] my jellies on with no warning strong
You telling on my fellas still be [?] on a hunt to leave your belly gone
[?] liquid dripping from your draws [?] get the saw

[Verse 4: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]
I can tussle with the best of 'em
Knuckle out the rest of 'em
Shuffle up the deck, deal a bubble the I'm blessing 'em
I never confess, never the less
I'm hitting the blitz whenever I'm stressed
Whatever however whoever want it can get it, talk shit and straight get beheaded (Ahh)
And I'll never regret it, fuck the world and fuck you too
I said it and I meant it and I always tell the truth
See and never catch me slipping, so what you gonna do?
When we steady on a mission and we coming after you bitches

[Hook x2: Fal$e Profit$ Coalition]

[Verse 5: Tech N9ne]
I was born in '71, saw Carrie in '76
A non heavenly bitch
Since then been a little bit a head of the click
Darkness hit a nigga with a hell of a kick
Halloween was a movie that taught me sick shit
Laughed at a motherfucker when pain is inflicted
Samhain was insane and wicked
Every halloween I gotta celebrate like christmas
It was a movie that was really good, Stephen King hit my hood
Little bitty kid, yes he should
Be studiying his arithematic book
But I didn't give a damn about nada
But Jason chopping the broads
My brain became so bane my name shoulda been Moustapha Akkad
So as my life went on, I helped my darkness grow
By watching TV learning sex, drugs and rock & roll
So you can call me evil, but I don't give a damn
Cause you gave me guns as a youngster with Yosemite Sam
Now a days in a bar room brawl, road raging, fights with the law
Is nothing here in [?]
Don't knock to slow your dissing
Cause I really wanna see you fall
Fal$e Profit$ Coalition
Tecca Nina killing all with a saw
