[Intro]
Hella faded
You wonder why everything so celebrated
And all of our team's dreams shot down
But made it to the top now out of Hell and above hard ground
We spreadin' our wings, all of my team make the Planet Rock, don't stop now
Was supposed to be a ghost, now when we party, I'm the host
We made it through the rain to the fame so I wanna make a toast
"I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!"

[Verse 1]
I been at the bottom where they fought and then they shot 'em
Was a problem summer, winter, spring and autumn
Gotta pray to God is what they taught 'em
Havin' not is what they got, so you right up in the column
Unless you got the will to go and get it
Unless you find a lick and go and hit it
I didn't bitch, I didn't march or picket
I just kick 'em something wicked then it turned into a ticket
Went from fights in school
To partyin' on stage where the hip-hop junkies Nice and Smooth
Way back in the day then Quincy J gave me a brightened view
Told me to rap what you know, took his advice then grew
Sick mother with no father, but still I made it as a scholar
But now I got to pop a collar, 'cause I started deep in squalor then I made some million dollars
I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!

[Chorus]
Even though we had a lot of nothin,' were we poor? Sho Nuff!
Did we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!
Coming up feeling good right now
Lot of love in the hood right now
Tell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!

[Verse 2]
I remember rubber sole footies on my feet
In the dead of winter, freezin' cold, walkin' in the streets
Off to 7-Eleven, only had enough to eat
A bag of Doritos with the chili and cheese inside 'em, it was cheap
Momma in the hospital, 17 I got little copped vittles
Pushing the bricks, scrubbing off the hot griddle
Too much struggle to tell y'all
But it ain't so much that I quit and stop makin' my mail tall
Aw hell nah! Made it through the rainy day
Never liked the devil and the games he play
Even though we in a gang, we pray
Yeah we broke the chains and the money and the fame, we slay
Use to be a man with no hope
Now to all my many fans I'm a G.O.A.T. (I'm the G.O.A.T.)
My struggle was a blast in the past
Now I'm gonna lift my glass 'cause I wanna make a toast
"I'd like to thank everybody that showed up
Now we 'bout to get poured up
'Cause we made it through the days it was so rough
So is everybody with me? Sho Nuff!"

[Chorus]
Even though we had a lot of nothin', were we poor? Sho Nuff!
Did we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!
Coming up feeling good right now
Lot of love in the hood right now
Tell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!
Even though we had a lot of nothin', were we poor? Sho Nuff!
Did we find a better way of livin' through this flow? Sho Nuff!
Coming up feeling good right now
Lot of love in the hood right now
Tell me something if you ain't a hater, do we go? Sho Nuff!
