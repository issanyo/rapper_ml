[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
I'm with my goon squad, we moving light 'em all
We hits the club and does our thing, my goonies buy the bar
We ghetto superstars, they know just who we are
We pistol poppers, chopper choppers, blame it on the bar
Yeah, I'm disrespectful, neglectful, when I be on that booze
I hope you listening I'm twisted and don't make sudden moves
I came to party chase pussy, but I'm still with the goons
If I get heated say fuck it, then they gonna clear the room
No need to wonder my thunders they out there by the whips
They keep the heaters near meters in case you pussies trip
See, I'm so gutter and gullie and I can make it ugly
I know these pussies be hating, but will they bitches love me?
But fuck some trouble let's huddle, I'm fisting for the day
And I'm beligerent, ignorant, but I'm still on my game
She say I'm so disrespectful and I keep calling her bitch
I told her suck on these huevos, then I said "Sorry n' shit"

[Verse 2: Bakarii]
They call me beast man, streets sweep your release then
Keep heat in my seat for the beefing
I keep it pimpin' keep my mug on monster
If they get to tripping I'mma plug they roster
I'mma minus niggas out upper cut and knock you
Give a three piece to this thug imposter
I just wanna kick it take a blunt to the head, but they hatin'
The bitches love me want to jump on my bed
I take 'em to the crilla, they just jump out they jeans
With petrone and amorilla, it ain't hard as it seems
My theme music pumping, baby arching her back
With ease I'm in her belly first night like a mack
Best believe, when we leave no strings attached
And she rings I chasing paper ain't no callin' her back
I proceed to pick her up but she was soon to forget
I hit and told her gobble my huevos, then I said "Sorry n' shit"

[Verse 3: T-Will]
You got T-will in the building, I'm pouring Liquor and chillin'
Rolling Swishers to the ceiling, plus, I roll with my villains, shit
And we just trying to kick it man, then a lot of bitches came
She cousins with such and such and she fucking with what's her name
I'm like whatever man and something hella better came
Hit me off with everything, plus her name and her game
We headed back to the bar and the liquor started to pour
She drank about (1, 2, 3, 4)
Yeah, now she's hella juiced up, baby start to loosen up
She wanna take me to the car and start to do stuff
Baby was a true slut and after two nuts
She said If I wanted I could put it in her Ooh what
She had my dick like as hard as a brick
After I hit, I went back into the party n' shit
Two weeks later, when I was out, she came up and said "What goes on?"
But I didn't recognize that ho' with her clothes on

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
The Rogue Dog Villains say "Sorry n' shit, OOH!
Fuck up erry party and shit, OOH!
The bouncer gone card me in this, Ooh-ooh, bitch, Ooh-ooh, nigga
We bang ain't no stopping this, man we on top of shit
Aim for my block or get pain from ya poppa, bitch
You need koochie therapy well Tech Nina's your doctor trick
I can make you wetter, but you better know how to rock a di-ick
Better take it with a job shackles, nob tackle
Get up on the dick and put it up in that esophagus
It better never be no obstacles, trippin' on my dick, I'll cackle
Grabbin' it like she in a rod raffle
I'm a nice guy when it's right I might fly
Down to the fridge to get the broad snapple
Take it and Miss Gotalotavit
Say, she the type that swallows it, I holler "QUIT!"
Cause she got to squeezin' on my balls a bit
I'll admit It was good at the beginnin', but you got to pardon me, miss
I said you hurtin' my huevos and she said "Sorry n' shit"
