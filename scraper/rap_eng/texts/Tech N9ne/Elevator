[Intro]
Top floor, Party on

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Elevator go up, (Elevator go up)
Elevator go down, (Elevator go down)
Elevator go up, (Elevator go up)
Elevator go down, (Elevator go down)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Come take a ride on my ele-elevator
I ain't got to make her, I ain't' got the chase her
She chose me cause my pockets made of papers
I chose her cause her booty mash potatoes go (up down)
Like a roller coaster
When I ain't around she be kissin' on my poster
I'm a dip in it like it's the ocean
Then slow down like slow motion (HEY, Hey!)
She show me things in the Mezzanine
It's lookin' like the biggest things Kali ever seen
Getting hot, don't wanna over cook it
The elevator got her walkin' crooked

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Elevator go up (Elevator go up)
Elevator go down (Elevator go down)
Elevator go up (Elevator go up)
Elevator go down (Elevator go down)
I bet you move it like this (like this)
I bet you move it like that (like that)
I bet you move it like this (like this)
I bet you would if it's Krizz (Kri-Krizz)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hey sexy girl, real thick girl
I'm tryin' to take you to the 13th floor
She say it don't exist, I say it's total bliss
She told me what the hell you take me for
We at the Weston, baby do the math
This elevator glass, look in you can see the shaft
That mean we hella exposed, so baby come out your clothes
And you can pose for the city, let it see the ass
We got to 13, she was squirting
I was smirking, elevator jerking
So much, baby couldn't get enough
It was like the elevator got stuck!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Brrr... sticka ha-ha-ha sticka
She a little different when she of a little liquor
On that potion, blowing, swolling
Got my vote and what she's promoting
Cause she light, bright, damn near white and I'm on it (Ok)
Chocolate, walk on quit, and I want it (Ok, aha)
And even though I got papers on it
She ride my elevator like a pony

[Hook]

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Party people, party on the elevator like (Hey!)
Party girls, you can ride the elevator like (ding)
Kali baby
