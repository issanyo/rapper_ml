[Intro]
I feel high
I feel really high

[Verse 1]
Feel like I'm in the sky with Roger Troutman
Looked down and saw the hate and a lot of doubting
But I've got a mouth that really do flow like a water fountain
Raising hell, but they can tell through me is Allah shouting
Dying to rip it, crying "I am the sickest"
Rhyming explicit, high-end, b-b-buying the ticket, see?
This is me, dismissing this, hiss if he disagree
Mr. T, spit the free so quick and give his chick a D
Okay, I'm back, having everlasting life
When you're rapping right, let me in, I ain't asking nice
Bashing mics, ripping it even if I'm half in height
It'll be smashing wives, get her open like Aston pipes
Alarmingly, God, I'm really horny and hot, on
But I'm warning the Dada
That he really don't want no carne asada
Ya beets on bread, soft, your flow been long dead
Hell I'm giving 'em is burning his arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Sheesh - It's a motherfucking release
My nigga Reef sent it from KCMO them Harry Fraud beats
I can barely be calmed, yet
Not to never beyond Tech
Hip Hop's a popularity contest
Very odd, they evil, and rarely God
But when I hit 'em up in a cherry Dodge
Metamorphosis, scary broads
Merry fairies carry bras, I'm gonna bury y'all
Necessary job by Nina and Harry Fraud
