[Verse 1: Godemis]
I do mean to be too mean
Shining like I do with new bling
And anybody wanna bite our routine
Will get cut like stella with the groove thing, back
And I mean that, bro homo
I'll cut that cunt looking like I don't know
I don't care, you can stand right there
I'll still play the money shot back in slow-mo
And four for the photo
I got zero tolerance for the po-po
They're unaware that I know
How to get whenever we ducking the five o
Look alive, this my show
That said, I don't gotta be macho
Moving the merchandise, I'm like Costco
Sharp cheddar it's better when it's not yours
Killer city committee we got shots for
Anybody who thinking that we not dope
They taking aim when I'm not close
Claim they can hang, well i got rope
Shit ain't the same and I got jokes
Punchlines connected with my quotes
I'm on a landslide and I got votes
And I'm leaping off of that top rope
Coming in hot like I wanna chop throats
CES Cru, we the new hip hop hope
One in a million will not rock boats
And they wondering is it ever gonna stop nope, please
With enemies like these we don't need anymore
We made a path and we came through it
Put a snake and a bat on the back of a fan when you rep that Strange Music

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Suck my soul and I'll eat your funky emotions
Rock out, rock out
Rock out, rock out

[Verse 2: Ubiquitous]
U-B-I
I do my own thang
What they gon' say? No se
Break it out my pocket when I pay for play
Book a three K for booker DJ
With the spirit of the Andre, tell him obey
I see my face in the Midi gold frame
Crime in the city but the city won't say
Running out of gas, you could give me yo lane
I'ma do it for the average Jimmy Joe Jane
I'm doing great, got my syllables straight
Turn a rapper yellow with the killer cold play
Feeling myself, they be feeling old age
I strip away they ego, I don't need a codename
Mister Viglione, really don't play
Augment an intellect, silicone brain
Numbing up my nerve now I'm feeling no pain
Loading up a gun but will it go bang?
They wanna ask, is he okay?
Are you serious? I'm doing just fine
I was living down low, you was up high
From the underground but I'm moving up, climb
I'ma drop another album, do it up fly
Bust another round, now it's shoot-em-up time
I don't got a gat but I got a mouthpiece
Put 'em onto the mat and I pin 'em down count three
I'ma push a boundary, coming for the bounty
Man always wonder why could they diggy-doubt me
Take a va-cay, I never been to Maui
Never dream about sleep, but I'm feeling drowsy
So they know a couple things and they wanna out me
Zipping up a lip when they come around me
Talking bad you don't wanna fuck around please
Godemis, U-B-I with the killer clown G, the king

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
One thing 'bout rock music
When you good you get them dames
White bitches, they want the main vein
Wanna get ahead of the pack to give brain
Put the middle leg in they lap
Good at rap? Then they begging for that
Matter fact, if you got the stacks say where the orgy at
Then a lot of whores come pour the sack
Ain't nobody fucking with it, said it on Sole's shit
Keeping it popping, that's how the MO stay rich
When I go lay hits, get a hoe way lit
Then I'm off in her mouth and I be the Colgate bitch
Uh, everybody love a nigga ripping it
Uh, make a lot of money then I'm kicking it
Uh, why ya lady bugging me to dip it in
Uh, stick it in, uh, uh, uh
You can bet the Nina got guts
Every chick been around me got fucked
And she never better come around and make it pop up
'Cause I'm bussin' on everything and make her mop up
Then smoke that
Super loud and we choke that
Look at her wow, it be so fat
Back in her mouth and she throat that (Bozack)
I got the cotton mouth
She stuck in here with my jock in mouth
Can't understand what she talking 'bout
When she making a blood spit Sriracha out
Tecca Nina got you lots of clout
I gotta be real with you
I got a big feeling you dropping out
'Cause we took her the cocking route
That's the way that we rocking out
Bitch

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Suck my soul and I'll eat your funky emotions
Rock out, rock out
Rock out, rock out
Bust my load and she eats up, that's called devotion
Rock out, rock out
Rock out, rock out
