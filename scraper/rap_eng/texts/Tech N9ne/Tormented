[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Rollers
Try to get it, not the jingle but the fold up
Stackin' papers and the coppers can't control us
Chasin' relish 'til my fuckin' pockets swoll up
God forgive me, but the heavens got to hold up
Get it quickly, is you wit me? This is sho' nuff
Don't be bitchy, 5-1-50, hit the dough up
Killa hippies, niggas wish we never showed up
Don't be dummy get that money daddy told us
Got to steppin' daddy left and never showed us
So we started pushin' weed and pushin' boulders
For Tony Roma on the corner 'til we blowed up
Get it sewed up

For Nina to get a piece of pie

All I want is money so I can fly
I'm chasin' rella scrilla cabbage money hungry 'til I die
(Tormented)
