[Intro]
Yo, what's up where you at? (Leaving the club)
Meet me at the crib baby (Alright)
How many you got with you baby? (Three)
Alright we gon' party, let's go (Alright)

*Phone rings* (Hello?)
What's up, where you at baby? (Leaving the spot)
Meet me at the crib baby (Okay)
How many you got with you? (Four)
Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, "Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky"
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Hook]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the afterparty)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the afterparty)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
"Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the afterparty

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the afterparty, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

[Hook]
