[Intro: Twista]
Yeah
And the question is why
Prozak, Saginaw what up
Tech N9ne, Kansas City what up
Twista, Chi-Town what up
And we do it like this

[Verse 1: Prozak]
How can somebody explain to me
Why we been followed by evil for so many centuries
Locked in prison the world is a penitentiary
Such a catastrophe and it follows our destiny
But crackhead mothers and fathers are beating their children
Suicide bombers are crashing our planes into buildings
While HIV is spreadin' and killin' off millions
And down in New Orleans thereâ€™s several abandoned civilians
They're spillin' the blood of other people for barrels of oil
The bodies are burning and scattered all over the soil
Feeling the tension as tempers and temperatures boil
Strikin' the soul is a serpent that rattles and coils
God, tell me what has now became of us
Shame on us for becoming a race so dangerous
And even with hate in us
You never did stray from us
Instead of forsaking us
You have forgaven us
Why?

[Hook:]
Why?
Why does the devil be callin' my name
Why?
Testin' my faith with his devilish games
Why?
Feeling insane as I was in the brain
Why oh Why?
Followed by darkness you fear them, then blow
Why?
Circle above me you see the black crows
Why?
Father forgive me you Reap what you sow
Why oh Why?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Do we get off on the fact that our governments fuckin' Iraq from the back
And we know that this hate is from us and not from Allah?
Why do we gamble with givers of grief?
And I'm wondering why do we live in the dark and my life's not fa la la la la la
Momma be askin' me, (why?) Do you believe in this?
Bitches be askin' me, (why?) Don't you wanna peep in this?
Niggas be askin' me, (why?) Do you put pussy on a pedestal?
Pimpin' you prolly should put money first 'cause you weak in this
Why is this shit draggin'?
Why does everybody know to operate a fully automatic
And nobody with the lovin' that the one above is givin' us a little bit of light up in the hell of it?
Everybody livin' in the polygamy you givin' me but ain't nobody celibate
So the question we askin' is Why?
Are we the wickedness? When is the trip for the sickness to fly?
Look at the blood and the tears and the piss and the shit in yo eye
God will be back any day any second so wait for the day that He spray and we die

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Twista]
Could you tell me why would he ever show mercy these days
Why?
Just look at the world we be cursin' the earth with these plagues
Why?
Sometimes I feel evil as if it's the birth of the worst
And the Earth needs emergency surgery all of this hurt can be raised
How?
Turn us into demons that's that's screamin' I'm dreamin' that even the devil was special before he had fallen from grace
Why do we murder
But God Won't abandon his women and children even though his baby's will bust a 380 all in your face
Why do we kill
Gotta hit him in the body with a bullet will you pull it but he never look a brother see he'll love us even if he didn't feel us to the fullest
Please tell me Why?
How you love us even though we gotta hurt each other even our brother or the mother I don't feel it on the realest you can put it any way you wanna put it
Why?
Even through the terror on the planet you can still find love
Why?
Even through the torture and the murder you can still find love
But if you try to be a rebel on a level of the devil we get buried with the shovel and be cast outta heaven so in hell we can still wind up

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why-y-y-y oh-h-h-h why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why-y-y-y-y oh-h-h-h Why?
