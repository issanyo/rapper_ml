[Intro]
Uh-huh, rain dance
Choking on the loud
Got liquor, plenty to go around
Episodes of Girls Gone Wild
Stevie Stone, Tecca Nina, Mystikal

[Pre-Hook: Stevie Stone]
Said she down with the illest
Drinkin' liquor think she tryna get the bidness
She got her ass to the ceiling
5 chains when there's money in the building

[Verse 1: Stevie Stone]
I don't have to show a rubber band to Pacquiao
Bring it back, got back, splat [?]
On the man, I'm the man still I mack a ho
Money made, only me, I'm an animal
Good Bentley Imma give her that billy (that billy)
Rain dance for the niggas in the city (in the city)
Automatic, Imma, Imma tug and pull left
No hands, going H.A.M, bitch you good at it
Yup, I'll make it bounce, like this (like this)
Hit Sway up in the morning, like this (like this)
Never seen this much money come around
Pocahontas, pokin' that I bit down

[Pre-Hook]
Said she down with the illest
Drinkin' liquor think she tryna get the bidness
She got her ass to the ceilings
5 chains when there's money in the building

[Hook: Stevie Stone]
I make it rain, ho'
I make it rain, ho'
I make it rain, ho'
I make it rain, ho'
I make it rain, ho'
I make it rain, ho'
Every time I come around then I make her rain dance

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Choctaw, native so I really does this
Rain dance for me, then give me a hug, bwitch
Because I throw hundreds they really want me to shove dwick
All up in 'em, they want that Nina to get in that love pit
Won't deny ya, 'cause lil mama super thick
Tie ya right up, 50 shades of whoopin' this
Buy a lighter, 'cause she want us two to get
Higher, higher (HEY) so we do this shit
That's what I do with the strippers
Paid a tip out and they coming home with us
We got the killer weed and we got liquor
The simple fact is we the niggas that did us
So it is normal they blowing my skin horn
And they know that they signing a sin form
When they come up in the house I then show 'em
Been a playa ever since I been born, bitch

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Yikes, I know what she like
Pipe, I be laying it right she said it's
Tight, and she want it with Mike
I finna be pedalin' in that pussy, like I'm ridin' a bike
After we leave the strip club my dick gon' be in her
She face down, rear end up
That's just how she'll end up
That what I came in this club for
That what I showin' her all this love for
That what I paid all them tips for
That what I left with this bitch for
She said "gimme some money, and I'll give you some head"
So I gave her some money, she gave me some head
Nothing else ain't a much had to be said
I fucked her so good, she came so hard
You woulda thought that she pissed the bed
