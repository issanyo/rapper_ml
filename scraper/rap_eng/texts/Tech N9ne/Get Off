[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
Yeah, oooh
Oh yeah baby I uhhh (Ooh-wee)
I wanna be on you (Ooh-wee)
I wanna be on you

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
See, it's gon' be a little different tonight
I think I'mma bag me a stripper tonight (stripper tonight)
You might think it's funny, but I don't
Want me to spend some money, but I won't lie
She said "I love it when you touching me"
It's twenty bucks, but you get one for free
Let's sneak off and get it on
Do it 'fore they end a song
And do what you want to do to me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She told me to do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
She told me to do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Girl you gotta take it off, baby let me break you off
Do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
She told me to do it (do it), take me (take me)
You saying my name, mama, I'm doing the same
Holla until we get off

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
We were out on the town
Woman that's grill we throwing down
Peppercorn Fillets and Columbia
Winery riesling, we swollen now
Baby girl wanna take me home
I put the Floetry music and A/C on
I'mma tell her that she may be prone
To getting me horny enough to make me bone
When I got to the crib nigga it was poppin', no stoppin'
On the couch to the floor then the steps
And the feeling was shockin', boot knockin'
Then my door bell rang ding-dong
I really want somebody to leave me 'lone
But it was the next door neighbor with a bb on
Maybe we can get a three bee on
She said to me "Could you keep it down a little bit?
You two got my bedroom shakin' I can really feel it
Would you like another girl, does your girl like other girls
If so I know this here will take you to another world"
Came in and went right to it, didn't have to Caribou Lou it
No ten minute mackin', it just happened quick just like I knew it
I had my lady screw it, then the next door neighbor blew it
I said I really 'bout to get off and I'm 'bout to shoot it

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She told me to do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
Do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Girl you gotta take it off, baby let me break you off
Do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
Do it (do it), take me (take me)
You saying my name, mama, I'm doing the same
Holla

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Let me see what your pockets are stuffed with
Make love with, 'cause I'm in love with a strippa'
I ain't no trick trick, but I'm a real big tippa'
She do just what I say, 'cause she know I bend the bar
She like the way I sing, I use her G-string as my dental floss (oss!)
I know that I'm so nasty, can't help but grab that thing
I don't let one get pass me, we all for 7 and 7, eyes get glassy
She said "You the the choir boy, why you like 'em so trashy?"
(Hey, hey)

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
I tell her: Earth girls are easy
Do 'bout anything just to please me
So every time I'm in the club, baby run right up
Talk and now we can see what's up

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
She told me to do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
Do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Girl you gotta take it off, baby let me break you off
Do it (do it), do it like you do it, do it
Doing it 'till you get off, baby that's how I get off
Do it (do it), take me (take me)
You saying my name, mama, I'm doing the same
Holla
