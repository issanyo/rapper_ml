[Intro: Tech N9ne]
This is so, so crazy
This long journey
Look at all the love you gave me
You gave me the strength
To keep on moving forward
Pushing me past the stars
Now the light I'm running toward

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
At the bottom of the barrel, I was like the rotten apple
And I never graduated, no gown, no cap and a tassel
But I stole my education, now I got my teachers baffled
Wonder why I filled the title of number one independent
God picked my name in the raffle
I was dealt a bad hand, wasn't gonna amount to nothing
Thank god that I had fans, keyboards, mics and percussion
Cause with that yo I elevated, now I'm just celebrated
Whenever Tecca Nina hit the public
Taking so many pictures, signing my autograph
Leaving messages on your voice mails and I love it
With all this new success I can't believe this love level
Specially when they thought that I was devil
A painted up psycho brother who loves metal
The response is overwhelming, for the love can't thank you enough
Dedicated to all the people who got me out of hell
Ya'll saved my life and stuff

[Hook: Jay Da 3rd & Tech N9ne]
I opened up my heart, showed you what I had inside
An ocean full of truth, too deep for the lies
You made it to the pain, had to swim through the pride
There's nothing else I need to survive
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, ay, it kept me alive yeah!)
Overwhelming! (So, so, so)
(Yeah, your love is so, its so, so!)
So overwhelming!(So, so, so)
(Yeah, it kept me alive yeah, yeah, come on!)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Back in the days I went through visions
In my head, dreams that you'd listen
But my wonderful fans they came
And made it all come to fruition
Sometimes with the females
I'll straight show my gratitude through kissin'
On the cheek, for the youngsters, foreheads
Or a legal pound for the fella's that screw vixens
Way back then I was bitter, was unused my music is litter
So mad and I'm mad I got jitters
Didn't consider that in a second I would be bigger
The label found that I was a hard hitter
I'd give'r shit was delivered hella hard from a spitter, gritter
Recognizing all the humongous love I'd get
On Facebook and positive messages on Twitter
This is how I tell you, thank you
To all of my fans, I thank you
And you can tell all those suckers
That hate on the Nina they just upset that they ain't you
Cause their favorite artist is lame
And neglects his fans, he does do
But your favorite artist goes out of his way
To show you that he loves you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
So here's to all of my fans
You're making my dreams come true
You helped me create this land
By believing that this one new
That one is N9ne, you brung
His time to everyone and rhymed
All though some is blind you brung
His lines to the sun and shined
Technician hunts, keeping my every condition pumped
Giving you what your suspicion wants
Waking up these hissing punks
To the early Strange fans
Thank you for feeling my pain man
But for the newbies - I'm so, so glad
That you made it, welcome to Strangeland
The tattoos, the tears, the gratitude, the years
My life's my debt through sound
Thank you, cause Tech you found
Just know that I'm thankful and
I will never ever let you down

[Hook]

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Wow, thank you to all who love me
I mean it more than you know
I love you for feeling my music
And coming to every show
And I will forever be there
Through rain, sleet or snow
You're right there with the stars
Krizz and Kutty now there's only one
Other place that we can go
