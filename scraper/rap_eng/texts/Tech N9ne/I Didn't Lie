[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Baby listen, I don't want to have to call you a bitch
But you can bet I'mma do it if you acting a witch
Every time you see another woman, pitiful ish
Better change before I get into some gangsta shit
Checking my clothes for N-O's
You think I'm all up in them hoes
Who love to be giving me demos
All up in my grill
You making a villain say goddwamn!
Baby what kinda nigga you think I am?
In the middle of a conflict with your nonsense
Where the calm went?
I read you like a book
And quite frankly bitch I don't like your content
I don't give a damn about a "he say, she say"
Shae Jones replay
If it ain't she say, then it's he say, he gay
9 millimeter heat day
Every time I gotta come home to this
Why you wanna do this?
Never woulda hit it if I knew this
Never gave it to a celebrity
Better be down with a nigga wit a early 70's mindframe
You all about mind games
Mrs. Sherlock always trying to find things
I'd rather be behind you given ya doggy style, hit so hard you get spine pains
Sluts, is a wonderful thing
But you gotta know I'm a nigga with a lust for green
Your friends say I'm a player, they wanna intervene
But they know they come at me they gotta terrible scene
Said I had a chicken over Juan's with the KY
Getting high
My reply, yous a motherfucking liar
Cuz I was up in the hotel all up in the jiggamapie
I didn't lie!
