[Intro: Krizz Kaliko]
I am such an animal
I am not a human being

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne]
Back on Everready I told you I was a beast
Moon stricken but my boy big Krizz Kaliko
He is such an animal

[Hook: Krizz Kailko]
See I'm an animal
I'm just an animal
I'm such an animal
I'm just an animal

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Ice water in my veins when I claim strange
Our slaughter ain't the same, I done seen thangs
It gets hotter in the flames, but I maintain
Why I bother to put a name to me, clang to me (Animal!)
It ain't enough for me to just bust
I needed to kick dust, I needed to vent
I ain't buff for elephant, like tough
I'm eating you niggas up, you edible then
'Cause I'm a wolf, I'm a wolf about my relish
And if you jealous, fellas, tell us
Got them huevos, come and get us (Kali!)
I show my claws and they pause
I make a nigga wanna get up off me
Killin' 'em and it ain't softly
Don't psych up on 'em even if they whack up on a
Nina taught me (OKAY!)
Packing the magnum better back up off
I'm really, I be causin' 'em agony when
I'm actin' like 'em...
Never stare at Medusa
See right through ya, animal!

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I am just an animal
I am not a human being
I am not an animal
I am just a human being
I am such an animal
I am not a human being
I am not an animal
I am just a human being

[Hook: Krizz Kailko]
See I'm an animal
I'm just an animal
I'm such an animal
I'm just an animal

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali soft tease a nice guy, I'll try
Never feed the animals read the signs, why die
You niggas beneath me, under me, hungry I'll eat ya food
Seriously dude, church boy packin' now release the Kraken
(Hush or bust us)
Will give it to you if you think you really need it
(Clutch are guns, bust, OK!)
You lookin' like a meal, watch an animal eat it
I tell it let the witch by night fall
Like care 'bout and keep your rifle
Kali's a beast unleashed, break out your knees and bible
Give 'em a pain, a stain they can't wipe off
'Cause I fight to the death I'll show ya
When I show my fangs it's ova
Now feedin' 'em before he even outta the way
'Cause I'm an animal, the baddest nigga on the mic
You niggas ever heard
Trust I kill for fun, kill for fun
Kali never needed a gun
When I'm in that  booth or I'm on that stage
When I'm out my cage
What? Run!

[Bridge 2: Krizz Kaliko]
I am just an animal
I am not a human being
I am not an animal
I am just a human being
I am such an animal
I am not a human being
I am not an animal
I am just a human being

[Hook: Krizz Kailko]
See I'm an animal
I'm just an animal
I'm such an animal
I'm just an animal

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
The Animal! Kali Baby!
