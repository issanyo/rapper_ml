(Welcome to Killer 2)

[Intro]
In my brand new Benz, thinkin' 'bout my so-called friends
And why should I make amends when they crossed the N9na
And sin again and again and again?
I love 'em dearly, but hear me, they burn severely
I'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one of them
None of them near me
Did trust you, but what's new for real?
Yeah, I love you, but fuck you for real

[Hook]
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

[Verse 1]
Met you at a rock show, November no Octo'
Took pictures then locked your numbers and then got low
Called you up a lot though, found out that you not ho
Several trips to my show, shot me with your crossbow
We used to kick it in packs, whites and blacks
Triple stacks and fat sacks, we matched, we relaxed
To kiss but I never twist her, she wished for the better mister
I mixed the lady with my kid brother and miss, she became my sister
For a minute but then my lady started receiving that snitch
By the nigga on tour, you wanna be the reason that split
You started believin' that bitch in San Jose
You gripped what the damn ho say
You flipped like a man will stay, no trips, never Saint-Tropez
We dipped, used to play for you, even used to pray for you
Never dap 'cause you wanted to spit in my face
It was up, up, up and away for you
I hate this, I was real, so why fake shit?
You lost her, so go fuck them bitches on MySpace, sis

[Hook]
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

[Verse 2]
Every show was a different face
But these two were from a distant place
Followed my tour got a quick embrace
Never would have thought I had to give them space
Father and daughter, loved me to death
Never cared that blood be the set
Just lovin' the Tech, shrugs in regret
When I found out papa kinda had the husband effect
Everybody seen it, but I didn't believe it
Everybody got it but never did I receive it
His dream was for me to fuck Miss Thing
But she looked fifteen, baby girl was nineteen
But instead of givin' her dick I rather give her ice cream
Now I'm trippin' 'cause her pops just tried to auction her off
But it turns out he was knockin' her off, I had to stop and I cough
'Cause that daddy turned out to be the boyfriend
Guess he was gettin' him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in
You lied to me, did it fuck wit' the N9na? Sure it did
Y'all made me question what your motive is
Don't cry Ally, but my temper was flared and scared also
To see you guess I'll see you in the crowd like Where's Waldo

[Hook]
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you

I wrote this carefully

[Verse 3]
I love you 'cause you married me when I needed therapy
Let me move in with you be my wife, you wasn't scared of me
But fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today
Better kick rock wasn't hard to say when you knew I rap my heart away
I love you 'cause you sexy, love you 'cause you beautiful
Love you 'cause way back in the day, you thought that I was suitable
But fuck you, you treated me, stupid and conceitedly
I wasn't very smart, but a genius you wanted me to be
I love you 'cause you strong, I love you 'cause you're real
Because you forgave me when I cheated and popped them pills
But fuck you for bringin' up shit that happened years ago
Chances of us gettin' back, it's gonna take a miracle
You live in the past, I'm givin' the gas and cash
How many niggas do that without you givin' the ass?
And I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her
G's in the house for you and the kids and even for your brother nigga
Enjoy the dough you get, 'cause I don't owe you shit
You was unhappy with me, so you split
You need to show me some love, ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you
Just acknowledge me takin' care of you because I'll, I..

[Hook]
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Kinda strange how you came at me)
I love you but fuck you, I love you but fuck you
I love you but fuck you (Things will never be the same with me)

[Outro]
Verse one, I ain't never spoke nothin' but highly about you
But you gonna believe a bitch you never met, that's hardcore shit baby
Verse two, I mean, y'all lied to a nigga
I mean, that was foul shit you did, man
I don't know what the fuck your motive was
But it hurt me real bad 'cause I trusted you, motherfuckers
Verse three, I know I fucked our marriage up
But you can't live in the past
You either gotta let that shit go, or let me go
