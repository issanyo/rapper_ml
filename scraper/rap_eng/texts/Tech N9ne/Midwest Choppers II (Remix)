[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
All across the U.S
Overseas... Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Yeah, Midwest Choppers)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)
Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (Nigga, Midwest)

[Verse 1: Twista]
Can you deal with the torture from the demonic side of a hustla?
I'mma cut yo head halfway off so you can suffa
Speed so deadly, God won't accept me
So this time around I asked the devil to help me

Spit it so murderous cause I gotta get 'em I gotta get with 'em
And if I could make 'em dead that'd be ugly
I'm rippin' your body I kill 'em like a villain
I'm ready and I'm willin' to see a massacre that'd be lovely
Never can records protect us from the K to keep it hot
Cause Twista be from the place where they be goin' hbbbb
TNT rhythm'll kill 'em on the block
Cause they steady be rippin' it like when the automatic goin' bbbbbb
How could you ever be thinkin' you could take it?
When they kick it whatever music and moves we be makin' it murderous
You heard us a demonic melody better be ready
And prepare to be scared of me fillin' his body with nervousness
When I be spittin' be like a lethal weapon
You gotta respect it when we be makin' everybody give it up
Individually demolish and diminish the competition
When I'm on a mission I gotta hit 'em up
I can fuck up anybody in the middle of the ring
If they got a homie then I'mma go and get a Tech
We can kill the drama with a bada boom bada bing
The tag team murder you know when to make a threat
And who the other nigga flowin' off the hizzy makin' 'em dizzy
Well it'd be bizzy where is he comin' from
C L E V E L A N D ain't no playin' me
When it come to me knowin' we be killin'
Now where we comin' from?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I am the definition of murda
The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
You're running but you can't go no furtha
Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia

Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
It's what you betta do when I'm bussin
I be flippin', I'm incredible, never get on my level
I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
I can take it to ya momma, ya daddy, the back of a caddy
You cut up in the sack with a baggy and I wanna...
Take it out and make it patty
You gotta be petty
Cause that'll be bad if you decide to mad, is you gonna?
You can listen to me and see I'm a nigga with the ammunition
I'm givin' the livin' a vision of death
Makin 'em sick and depressed
Cause I be givin' everything
I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
Makin' 'em walk in the business
I get up in it to rip and diminish ya
Trip and I finish ya
Dig it, you really get me livid, I'm 'bout give it a pivot
I'mma stick it so we can differ to sinister
I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin off us
Better not let me up on the premises
Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya
Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
Other rappers are damn jokers
They be givin the people comedy
But the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker
