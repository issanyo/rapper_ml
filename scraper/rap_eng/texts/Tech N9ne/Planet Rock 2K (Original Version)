[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You want me to jam I'm finna enter
Brain waves came from insane days
Make ya sick like bad mayonnaise
(Tech N9ne!) Got the remedy rhyme infinity
Criminally finna be some shit
I crack you open like the youngest male Kennedy
Got the whole planet rockin' off the low blows dammit
I show flows and poke hoes that's 'posed to be yo's
Seein' my haters in a dark alley tormented by mind
Dodgin' the (Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech - N9ne, N9ne, N9ne, N9ne)
Now here's the message
Liberate me, Chocolate
Take 'em and rock now play
Do the fuck what I say
Throw ya souls in the air like this
Flash ya bar codes while I stick 'em
With another hit up out of the abyss
The Tech N9ne Nina out to find vaginas
Just the playa clubbin' it, rubbin' it
Lovin' that crema streama, might seem a little extreme
My thing when I flips I gots to make sho' that it's hot
And make the whole planet rock like this

[Bridge]
Here's my chance to blast away (Tech Tech N9ne N9ne *echoed*)
Haters causing friction

[Chorus]
Party people, party people

(Who keep it sizzlin'?) Tech N9ne!
Party people, party people

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Call it what you want it, ghetto futuristic come get up on it
There's a bianc up in my sector, can I bone it?
Cause all we want to do is get drunk, get blowed
Spin shit, spark blunts, and fuck hoes
We quick to beat a buster down bad
Midwestside put me in the Soundlab
Now I'm tenalp kcor
I flipped it backwards for you flow snatchers
Blast ya'll in the ass, Nina playin' fast ball
Crash all glass jaws
Mad y'all cause last call I was in the back of the club
Bangin' the hell outta this bad broad
On my planet we take no haters for granted
They Kris Kross (10 seconds 'til lift off)
Be soaked in pistol grip sauce, ripped off
The technique's complete heat
Retreat 6 feet under 6 feet
Unique speaks, freaks tweek
Never let the BCs can it, while the trooper Tecca Nina rock the planet, nigga

[Chorus]
Party people, party people
Can y'all get funky?
(Who keep it sizzlin'?) Don Juan
(Who keep it sizzlin'?) Tech N9ne!
Party people, party people

[Interlude: Don Juan]
I'm about the strippers in the back makin' ass hop
A Mitchell Bade tryna grip 'em like a pad lock
The Don Juan really never let the cash stop
The Tecca Nina make the planet rock
It don't stop

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I got that type of flow to make 'em make Scream 3
Six rappers being hunted by a killa MC
I never killed a bianca with a 36D
A party with the bitches on my planet lookin' crispy
Swiftly makin' rappers do 360's (Never knew three 6's)
Other niggas tryna diss me be (Under these prefixes)
Non ill mal-functional (N9ne!) Rambunctional
Never let up on a heated mic 'til I'm comfortable, Rogue style
57th-56th Street Gang, grips we gain
Anybody wanna trips we bang
Hit us with a what? (Lyrical head splitter)
(Makin' hella hoes get a nut)
(Make 'em put the rolls in they butt)
(Let a ho be a slut)
(Negaro never give a fuck)
"Why the attitude? Nina ross you got the sauce"
Nigga, I'm mad cuz the Chiefs lost, I'm pieced off
In Kansas City, I'm straight from the abyss, Tech N9ne!
I got the planet rockin' with me
Whole planet rockin' like this

[Bridge]
Here's my chance to blast away (Tech Tech N9ne N9ne *echoed*)

[Chorus]
Party people, party people

Party people, party people
Can y'all get funky?
