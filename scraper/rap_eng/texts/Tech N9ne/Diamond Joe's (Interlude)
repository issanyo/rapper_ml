It was a Friday Night and our home boys decided to celebrate our departure from J-Core
So you know us, we had to go to the strip club
Everybody said they wanted to go to DJ’s so we did
So we get up in Diamond Joe’s and we got VIP
The owner shows us a lot of love
So he shows us to our seats and Trap orders a round of 151 rum and Coke’s and that’s when I seen her, dawg
