[Intro]
Turn on the tele every thing so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80's
What's the meaning when your hear an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazy

Walkin' amongst insane terrorists, everybodys a demon so then came your therapist
Know that your therapists are also aware of this state of emergency is lookin' burgandy even your sherriff is
Scared of his neighbor mabye because people are goin' crazy, sick mothers drowning their babies
And why they have to make it where aids be, from here to zambia, and why I got the same last name as andrea
Niggas snipin' shootin' rifles for fun ,niggas fighting grip the knife and live the life by the gun
Most of us are livin' life on the run, sittin back gettin fat waitin for whats in the bible to come
Steady high speed chases, I see racists often inside their sci-fi dream matrix
You might see la-la land but I see hatred, killings and talibans with ??? faces

[Chorus]
Turn on the tele every things so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s
What's the meaning when your heari an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazay

(In your High School)
There's shooting where's the shelter?
(What can I do?)
Modern day Helter-Skelter
(In your residence)
My neighboors taking from me
(Mr. President)
This world's so money hungry

Something ain't' stirring the kool-aid man
Look at the sickness and evil that you made man
Gotta stay creepin' through my city because everybody dieing
Hard ta trust niggas with me because everybody blind
The sign of the time it would be fine to have weapons designed
For half-steppin' in crime, have seconds to shine before they shut it down on us
Some'll clown on us, seems to be a frown on us
My niggas fighting even the sports future lookin' hazy
Gettin money like men but acting like babies
My people lookin' at me shady
Yo somebody fiddlin' with the chicken and watermelon cuz niggas goin crazy

[Chorus]

Turn on the tele every things so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s
What's the meaning when your hear an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazay

(In your High School)
Theres shooting where's the shelter?
(What can I do?)
Modern day Helter-Skelter
(In your residence)
My neighboors taking from me
(Mr. President)
This world's so money hungry

Let it be known that theese young men are dying for money
And their family and friends mornings are no longer sunny
Blood shed to the twentieth power they promise you no blood shed, but plenty in showers
We live by an eye for an eye, that's mans death motto
If man is gonna lead us right, then man less follow
And lead us right into war, but damn that's hollow
But the average kid all they know, is Grand Theft Auto
And no matter where you go in the city streets, it's a game
When I'm off in the demons pit I feel the heat for the pain
And the world is a crazy place, and everyone is insane
Why else would they want to simulate JFK's death in a game?

[Chorus]

Turn on the tele every thing so shady
Thangs changed ain't the same since the 80s
What's the meaning when your hear an old lady?
Drowns her baby see the world's gone crazay

(In your High School)
Theres shooting where's the shelter?
(What can I do?)
Modern day Helter-Skelter
(In your residence)
My neighboors taking from me
(Mr. President)
This world's so money hungry
