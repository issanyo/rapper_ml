[Intro: Brotha Lynch Hung]
You know how people be sayin' that I, uhm
Talk to dead bodies, uh, uh, everybody say that
Are you dead? Nah, fuck it, you don't have to say nothin'
Anyway, any-, you attack Tech for nothin'
Hopsin go through that same shit
Aight, we gon' handle this
You want somethin' to eat?
Aight, get you somethin' to eat
Or you might be eaten!

[Verse 1: Brotha Lynch Hung]
Niggas in Sacramento don't want it with me
Tuckin' a .50 cal, should get me now, I'm 5150
I bet a nigga won't try me, I like to fry 'em up
Line 'em up, bring 'em in front of me, I'ma dye 'em up
I put his nuts in a bag and send it to mommy
And have her yellin', "What's in the bag?", I'm a tsunami
Niggas attackin' my label get wrapped in a cable
I'm back in the stable and I'm killin' 'em, crackin' an Eggo
(Grrr!) Mad-ass, bad-ass, everybody be wantin' to have that, nah-that
Givin' me somethin' to stab at, yeah-that
I'ma be huntin' they ass back (Brrat-brrat!)
I'ma be somethin' to deal with, real shit
See the only way I eat is if I kill shit
Me and Tech and Hopsin gon' pop 'em
Put 'em right in the lake, "Hey, don't drop 'em"
Told 'em not to fuck with us, nigga

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung & Tech N9ne]
Niggas' about to get stabbed (Grrr!)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
He said he wanted K.O.D. to come do this.. Ok
People don't feel me, I think I'm really Michael Myers
You think it's silly, not givin' a fuck until the psycho fires
When I go higher, you said to me, "Why do you need a rifle, sire?"
My pill is to kill a man, I'm illin', yeah, snipe your eye, I light your fire
Leave us, now he's after Jesus-ah
Happy Holidays, I am f'ing Ebenezer-hah
Oh, what a teaser, he was not a bleeder
But you need to believe that I feed, I'm eager-hah, hah
Yeah, I heard what he said
He ain't able to spit another verse when he dead
Burnt a nigga, serve him the curb then he bled
With Bourbon, I swerve to put his virgin into bed!
(Cha!) Yeah (Cha!), you niggas gotta be kiddin' me, not even hittin' me
'Bout to get your bodily stiff and the ought to be kissin' me ass bad
That'll be sad because the nigga's about to get stabbed, jab!
Why do they persist, Lynch?
When they know that we'll kill 'em all

[Hook: Brotha Lynch Hung & Tech N9ne]

[Verse 3: Hopsin]
I was brought up as a man that loved to laugh
Greetin' everybody with a handshake (Hello)
Until I built a fan base, now I gotta deal with
Groupie niggas I run into every damn day! (Rampage)
I swear to God I'm hopin' to leave a niggas rib cracked
How the fuck did they find out where I live at?
Motherfuckers all up in my business every minute
When I be chillin' with women they be comin' up tryin' to chitchat
Get back! Oh, shit, what the fuck did I get into?
No autographs, I'm tryin' to chill with my friends, dude
Yeah, don't surround me, I can't move
Can't you see I'm tryin' to get to my vehicle? Please let the man through!
I ain't feelin' no sorry and I finna go hit up my nigga Lynch
I'ma borrow a knife and startle the lives of anybody buggin' me
I don't know if I'ma kick 'em or cut 'em, man, it's hard to decide
I'ma start to devise a method of deadly weapons
No question about it, you run up then you gon' get affected
Go step in the ring if you fools dare to
You gon' second-guess on takin' a picture with me 'cause you too scared to
(Aight, ey, hold up my, nigga, ey) What's up, man
(You that nigga Hop, right?) Yeah
(The white contacts and skating on a skateboard)
Ey, I gotta go real quick (Can I get a picture with you, my-?)
Nah, man, get outta my-, get the fuck out of my face, fool!
