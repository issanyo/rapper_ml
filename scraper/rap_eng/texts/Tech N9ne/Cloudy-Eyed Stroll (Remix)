[Intro: Don Juan]
Now see (Say what?)
We finna get cloudy-eyed for a minute, you know what I'm sayin'?
So I need everybody to blaze the weed and grab 'em a bitch
Let me see you shake it, let me see you naked
Let me see you shake it, I wanna see you naked

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Sunday morning I awake with head aching from the night before
Me and my niggas at the bowling alley trippin' 'cause we all tore
I reminisce and kinda laugh despite my pain
'Cause they kicked us out for throwin' balls in other people's lane
Sunny day in the summer is 'bout to become a cloudy one
Outey from perious puffs, devious sluts, mischievous stuff
Picked up the phone, it's on
I got my niggas on the line ready to swoop the N9ne
Once again I'm pulling out my relish to spend
But today I'm not gonna take these bitches to the West Glen
'Cause me and my Rogue Dogs and Road Hoggs
Slippin' on a mission and contemplating on old calls
30 minutes later I'm waiting at the door, ready to go
Feelin' relieved when I heard my niggas roll
Yellin', "That's my ride" as my baby girl cries
Stepped inside, looked around and everybody's lookin'

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Come and take a ride with me, fly with me
Get high with me, come and get cloudy-eyed with me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Everybody's blown but me
Timly got them straight cumulus in his eyes
Puffing because Dr. Bombay and Purple Fuzz up above
This Sunday sunny day had that (?)
Scoob just started because his eyes restratus
435 North, we dipping the suburbans filled with smoke
We jerking I'm hoping to get the new rotation working
No joking, eyes open, for the feels what it is
What it was, what it shall be is we high on L.A. indeed
Pass the puffy on the mid west town side, much obliged
'Cause I'm feeling high up and cloudy-eyed
Windows down, wind goes round my crown astounded
Right now my marial don't wanna be grounded
I clowned it Now my name is Munchie
Ooh, you high, 7-11 got the best food in the country
Blunts be serious when stuffed with funk
From the depths of Mizzou, niggas have no clue what to do
Caught up with black in Texas Will
What's the deal? On our way to New Peking for real
We loud and boisterous as we stepped inside
People looking at us funny 'cause everybody's looking

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Come and take a ride with me, fly with me
Get high with me, come and get cloudy-eyed with me

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Cloudy-Eyed Stroll, now my stride's slow
Walking up out the New Peking eyes closed
Took another hit from the poison mist
Got my brain on twist but I still persist
What's up? What we doing on a Sunday eve
It's straight to 5-6, best believe
We calling up some biancas on the humbug
To come down around the town
Everybody else is Skateland bound
5-6-1-6 Highland feeling far out like Thailand
My man Diamond said no one can roll 'em like I can
Damn, once again it's on the beatrices from the phones
In the house and they straight getting blown
What ever happened I don't know, woke up on the floor
5 o'clock in the morning, I'm read to go for sure
Gotta get back to the crib my squeeze said this shit is getting old
They dropped me off and that's the end of my (Cloudy eyed) stroll

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Cloudy-eyed, cloudy-eyed
Come and take a ride with me, fly with me
Get high with me, come and get cloudy-eyed with me

[Outro: Don Juan]
Let me see you shake it, let me see you naked
Let me see you shake it, I let see you naked
Let me see you shake it, let me see you naked
Let me see you shake it, I wanna see you naked
