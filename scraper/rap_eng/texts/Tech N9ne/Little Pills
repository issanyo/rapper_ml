[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko and (Tech N9ne)]
Try to break through it's like we'll never (it's like I'll never make it)
Make it better (Gimme pills let me take it)
I can't change the weather (yeah)
And I'm going back to where I've been
Hope somebody lets me in
I need shelter from myself
If you can hear me please send help

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It keeps on raining in my mind
Another storm another day
These little pills won't change my mind
'Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on raining in my head
Another storm another day
These little pills will change my mind
'Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on raining

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
It's over, It's over, It's over, I'm sober
It's over, It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober
It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober
I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober, It's over

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko and (Tech N9ne)]
Can only see myself is anybody here (I ain't even myself no more)
If you could be myself you'd understand me clear (Help pick myself up off the floor)
And if I die today it would take my pain away
'Cause it's flooding, flooding
And I'm drowning, drowning
But it's liberating me

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It keeps on raining in my mind
Another storm another day
These little pills won't change my mind
'Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on raining in my head
Another storm another day
These little pills will change my mind
'Cause they don't make it go away
It keeps on raining

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
It's over, It's over, It's over, I'm sober
It's over, It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober
It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober
I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober, It's over

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Let's find a way to run away from life full of pain and strife
What direction am I going I can't tell now
Mister 7-20 Nina tells me I'm hell bound
The IRS is on my ass for the check that I didn't cash
And the levy from child support felt like I fell down
So I'm looking for Ecstasy pills
Tech is the next to be thrilled
Seconds from method we ill daily
My brains cooking the recipe will
Beckon the best of me kills
Sections of 7 and I feel crazy
Hit the club in the night
With a little bit of drug in my life
But I'm pretty sure lovin' it real high - I'm delivering
With my seeds out my sight
Separated from my wife
In the middle of a crisis I'm high
Shaking and shivering
Rolling balls I'm elated and going dumb now
Drinking liquor I'm faded and having fun now
Loaded gun and I'm tripping with everyone around
Keep me stuck in the sky I never wanna come down

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
It's over, It's over, It's over, I'm sober
It's over, It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober
It's over, I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober
I'm sober, I'm sober, I'm sober, It's over
