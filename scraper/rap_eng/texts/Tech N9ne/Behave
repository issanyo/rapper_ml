[Intro]
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Don't tell me, don't tell me
Baby if I...

[Verse 1]
What if I told you here and there I got a chick on the side
Now what if you told me you do the same thing
I think I would die
Does that make it worse cause I did it first, you still did your dirt
If you meant to flirt, then why you even leaving wearing a skirt

[Bridge]
Get right or get left and
I learnt a big lesson
We fighting like I don't like you like
It's such a big mess and
There's never a right time to say goodbye
So if you did it, keep it inside and

[Hook]
Take it to the grave
You can't tell me that angels don't behave
(Don't tell me, don't tell me)
Take it to the grave
And don't tell me my angel misbehave
(Don't tell me, don't tell me)

[Verse 2]
Now what if I told you I had a feeling 'bout you, would you lie
And if you say you got something to tell me I think I would cry
It's nothing but bad news when you say we need to talk
And if I had to choose, rather you save the thought

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Baby, you so good to me
All the stuff I took you through cause I'm crazy and you stood with me
Out of love, you my angel to heaven, you the plug
To get me lifted above, I thought that was what it was
But I found a letter saying you met somebody better
Thought our love is forever, my face has never been wetter
You admitted it, girl this hurt is enough to make me hit a bitch
But I'm safe, never tarnish my thoughts of you girl
Take it to the grave

[Hook]
