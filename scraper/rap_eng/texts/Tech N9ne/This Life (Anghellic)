[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I started out with
No dough, no clothes, no shows, and no hoes
And ended up with
Mo' hoes, mo' shows, mo' clothes, and mo' dough

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I used to be the ideal nigga
Preppy like Hilfiger, pretty 'vill nigga
But wanted to make my dollar bill bigger
Turned into a field nigga, not pickin' cotton
But pickin' mics up and rockin', recoppin' so I can feel richer
Then I started drinkin' real liquor
Send me a groupie, and I will stick her real quick
The dilsnick it will hit her ex pills, I can feel, nigga, best deals
You can get the steal if you ill I'm concealed with a

Technina millameter by my side

God used to guide me
Lucifer beside me, evil was lively
Trippin' with wifey, never was treatin' her nicely
What this music got me into?
This is the message I'mma send to, God
The evil shit I've been through
Lettin' me really know what sin do
Listen, cause the hurt cut me deep like a Ginsu

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel, but the devil's possessing my brain

[Verse 2: Bakarii]
This life, full of money, bitches, weed, and riches
Kansas City niggas grind, cook it up in the kitchen
Pay attention to the corner nigga, roguish and rugged
Nigga, fuck it, it's a must I conceal it and tuck it
This life, can make a nigga murder for nothin'
This life, for the money have you fakin' and frontin'
This life, can make a nigga take a deal with the devil
This life, got me rippin' up shit in my kennel
Ya see, I live in the rain, and laugh at the storm
I mastered the pawn, bringin' war at the crack of the dawn
Tottin' the bomb
A nigga with a third eye vision, like a Malachi
Blowin' smoke in the sky
See the world through the eyes of a real nigga
Look into my eyes, you can tell I'm a rider

[Interlude: Tech N9ne]
More shows, more clothes
More hoes, more dough
And no foes yo

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's possessing my brain

[Verse 3: Short Nitty]
Sometimes I wonder:
How did I survive with all this drama in front of me
Poppa went out like a bitch for runnin' from me
Though momma never lied, she cried
Seen me sittin' in prison, servin' a sentence with bad intentions
Still no repentance
I'm heart broken while chokin' on a joint dipped in water
And high hopin' the future's wide open for my daughter
My eyes are open to all animosity
Constantly falling quickly
The devil calls it a blessing to cross Nitty
Lessons are taught quickly
Hell, my pride will die with me
Then to repeat back to the penitentiary, visit me
Hell bound, coffin dwellin' before a life in the cell yelllin'
Now free me I'm in desperate need immediately
Truthfully speakin'
My life from night to day
24 hours I fight, despite this hell, to pay
Can't wait to see the day when my adventures begin
With this here life of sin, I'm all in

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne]
(This life) Caught up in the fame
In the end will I forever burn in the flame
(This life) I live in the rain
I'm an angel but the devil's possessing my brain

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Is it heaven or hell? I really can't tell it
Half cupid half relic, my life is anghellic
So I dance with the devils, and I fly with the angel
And I stand on a level where mind is so tangled
(This life)
