[Intro]
Welcome to The Sextion, where it's all about sex
If horny is what you're looking for, well this is the place
The Sextion
Now, for your listening pleasure
This is Tech N9ne, Skatterman and Krizz Kaliko with seven words
How many words?
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
You should look at this as a wonderful endeavour
The pleasure of having a bitch go below the belt for treasure
No pressure, I know you shy and I ain't tryna stress ya
Can I undress ya? And get ya to swallow each and every measure?
Damn! You put the "whore" in hormones, I might just bust before long
Let's take a pic in your phone of you taking more and more dome
Do it but don't pinch me, don't chew it when you think me
Get fluid then you sink me, 'cause you got to/two it just like pinky
I really love it when you put the hot water in your mouth
Slurping and slobbering about, now it gets hotter in the south
Yep, the water was blazing, it was amazing
And now my dick is shriveled up like a raisin'
You love my leg in third, 'cause I'm blessed with heaven's curve
And I equal the thrill and rush of having sex on X and herb
Never get the lesson blurred, I'd like to rest in her
But not before I issue baby doll my seven words

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

[Verse 2: Skatterman]
For the sake of argument, let's say we call her "Ol' Girl"
She had the type of lips to make this street nigga's toes curl
It's her world, all I do is kick back, just sit back
She let my zipper down and pulled the head out and licked that
She licked that, sometimes I had to fight to get my dick back
But baby moved to Minnesota, swear to God I miss that
The way she used to grab and smack herself all in the face with it
Looking at me dead in my eyes while she be tasting it (tasting it)
She used to say "Daddy, you wasting it" (wasting it)
I used to say "Baby, I'm pacing it"
But fuck the hot water shit, she used that crushed ice (crushed ice)
If she sucked your dick once she make you nut twice (nut twice)
She was just that good
I could sell her for a stack to my boys in the hood
So if you got you one of these, keep them faking bitches to the curb
Leave this on her voicemail, all you need is seven words

[Bridge: Krizz Kaliko]
Now as she sucks my soul, I lick her funky emotions
Piercing all the way into her mind so I can feel what she's thinking
Feel me? I know you do
We're getting closer and closer, eruption is imminent
Climax is closing in on us
If you don't get your hands on me soon, I might disappear
Here is what I been waiting on, the best thing you ever heard
The one, two, three, four, five, six, seven words

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
It's the best thing in my world
It's seven words I wanna say to you
"Love it when you suck my dick"
Girl, it's why I'm giving you seven words

[Outro: Tech N9ne + (Female)]
Mmm, mmm, you know what I want you to do, right?
(Yeah, I know what you want me to do)
What's that?
(Do you want it with hot water?)
What's that?
(You mean to tell me freaky ass Tech N9ne ain't never had it with no hot water?)
Nah, show me
(Hold up a second)
What the fuck?
(And then you do it like that)
OK, go ahead... ahh shit, fuck, that's wonderful!
(That's what I thought)
