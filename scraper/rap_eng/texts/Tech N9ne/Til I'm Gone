[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I made a mistake
Now you can choose to stay and live with that mistake
Or beat me over the head with it over and over
'Til I'm gone

[Hook: Kiddo A.I.]
Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If you're blinded by the limelight that shines bright
On this individual's residuals fond slitch
Your mind might rip up the mess to design fights
To cry heif, destined to plummet in hindsight
If you feel you in my shadow and females'll get you rattled
With every tale they tattle, you raise hell in battle
Let us jail and hassle when the Queendom fails the castle
She unveils the shackles trying to bail is natural
You still here but complaints they stick
'Cause my life is too complicated and ain't basic
So the saint may split
Stay after that hiccup, you can't play vict
No you can't say sh-

[Hook: Kiddo A.I.]
Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You chose to ride on this carousel
Anything petty, I parasail over
You stay where there is hell
I'm drowning in Seroquel
Embarrassed this resembles marriage under a terror spell
Running free even though the cerebel isn't parallel
I do something you think is shady and you stay
Says you agree with us moving forward and we like okay
But a year later that means you can't take us back to that day
If so, better watch what you say 'cause it'll have us in disarray
Aye, so beat it 'til it's broke and closed
Break me down it won't be smooth like lotioned bows
Chosen souls meet the love potion flows
But when the oceans froze that's when we get ghost and rogue
Baby

[Hook: Kiddo A.I.]
Beat it 'til it's broke and closed
'Til I'm gone, 'til I'm gone
This heart is just a fallen rose
So I'm gone, so I'm gone
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right
You know you're my highlight
Fell into the limelight
Break me, I'll be all right
Know that I'll be all right

[Bridge: Kiddo A.I & (Tech N9ne)]
Break it, I'll be on my own (Just Me)
Back home, (Where I belong), I'll be good (Yeah)
Break it, I'll be on my own
Back home, I'll be good

[Outro: Tech N9ne]
Don't do it
Move forward
You keep nagging me over and over
'Til I'm Gone
