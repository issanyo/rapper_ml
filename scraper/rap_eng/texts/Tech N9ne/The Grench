[Intro: Tech N9ne]
I hate you, can't stand you
Despise you, detest you

[Hook: Big Boy]
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I can't stand your persona, the drama, your marijuana, or your momma
I really despise yo ama so comma I disapprove who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G
I would've sought ya, caught ya, and then offed ya
I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em how I see 'em when I see scum
I free from the legions cerebrum I see none stupid and just really dumb
Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your wars
Funk bein' your poor, haunts me and of course
You punks being endorsed, chumps being assured
Dumped me in the wharf
Detest you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate It would be great For you to skate
Off in a lake a beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

[Hook: Big Boy]
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
We're livin' in the cold age
Road rage, dark no Sol√©
No way Jose Cuervo, there goes yo day
Very scared everywhere knows mo' gay
Dislike is too soft, hate is more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you and your blue walk
Your crew fought, your crew lost so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off
So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can, under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my fam, I slam you
Samhain, Champaign, your family and you
I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for JCOR
'Cause your state will create race wars

[Hook: Big Boy]
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I feed you when you destroy buildings
And kill millions of children from Black, White, Chinese
To Sicilian
I thrill when you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your deaths, miserable until then
I wanna put on my Reeboks, and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Apocalypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was monogamous, doggin' us, you botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those who exit to sodom us
I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your lifespan go, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle, you vandals
Saw 666 in your blood sample
Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and Crips and Bloods and drugs
Nazis show no love, never we be equal
My name is the Grench and this song is dedicated to the evil people

[Hook: Big Boy]
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise
Look away from me when you see me, never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily, so this can't be paradise
When you walk; don't come my way and don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm the Grench I smell your stench and it is you I so despise
