"There's actually just one big thing on which most people base their final decision."

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Hungry! Hungry!
Starving!

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I think it's safe to say I'm a monster
Yeah, because killin' is my mantra
Fellas wanna see me dead up yonder
But the women are fond of Ron, it’s Don they conjure
I’m big-headed 'cause Tecca Ninna stay breaded
I get it the wettest, competitive, I just shredded your bed
It’s the crevice I fetish, call the medic you’re deaded
Push and pull, you’re placed at pathetic
Soul is so not sympathetic
I’m on a roll, creepin' and I am outta control
Women see Tecca Ninna as the matter in the commode
So I’m in there, like swimwear
On a lady that’s ridin' inside of what’s skin bare
I’m so hard, niggas don’t even wanna face me
But it’s the opposite with their women, they taste me
So many hoes witness the trouble I bring, they cling for the stream
I’m the king, I go by the name of "the thing"

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko (Tech N9ne)]
It's sorta like a whatchamacallit (The thing!)
If you ever saw it (The thing, the thing!)
Give it to you like there's no tomorrow
Sorta like both of ours (The thing, the thing!)
You believe in what you believe in, B.I.G. for a reason (The thing, the thing!)
All in 'em like I live in 'em hoes
The thing's what I'm givin' 'em though

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Heart breaker, body part taker
From your lady, negras hate us 'cause thou art fakers
Schemin' when seekin' I found a tush
When I blow that kush with a rhyme, and I be beatin' around the bush
Area, I'm scarier than malaria, the carrier of hysteria
I swear he's just nefarious, with hairy nuts, the cherries bust
Don't tell me to zip it, I'm wicked
Your ladies, they take me in like a whip it
Got a mind of my own, I'm in a zone
I get deep into her like Tech N9ne in a song
You can't tell me nothin', I'm in my prime and I'm grown
My homie Nina behind, I still climbin' alone
Ill spit, real sick, need help real quick
See nobody can hit the kill switch
Still chill chicks, come and get me somethin' that I can feel, bitch
Drill stick, I am Tech N9ne's dilsnick
