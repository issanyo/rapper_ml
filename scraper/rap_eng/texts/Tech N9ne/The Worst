[Intro]
This is dedicated to my peeps

[Verse 1]
As I blaze the PM, I inhale with the scent of a million men
I exhale with dumpin' 17 up in the front, I am
In the midst of a crisis God knows all the sacrifices I made
Might have to heist to get paid
In spite
But can't just the price
That a nigga played bitch made
Niggas think they know me
The don't know me
They, phony funny
But they don't know
That I'm that ill type niggas that'll open that gut
Not much luck
I'm feelin' skunk with a capital S
Hit the cess, killed the stress, rottin' away in the Midwest
I guess
They was right
When they said I was such a psycho sight
Sick inside a slight
Deliver that makes me want to go Master P at night right
No more pain I complain and pray to God, and stuffs
It was unbearable until I tried Cocoa Puffs
That Chocolate Thai got me willin' to fly up in the sky
But when I lose altitude that high
Makes me wanna just come down and die
Who's responsible for this madness, me?
Whos' responsible for this sudden strike of sadness, me?
I can see
I can look into your eyes
Smile and then to your surprise
I'll be yellin', "Die, nigga die"
When all the bullets fly
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
'Cause I'm the worst type of, nigga on this here turf
So disperse

[Chorus]
The worst, the worst yeah
They keep tryin' to pull me under
But I been to long tryin' to make it over
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do

[Verse 2]
What it is
What it was
And what it shall be
You tell me
'Cause this nigga ain't livin' healthy
Bitches think I got money from here to Sri Lanka
So I'm thinkin' of killin' you when I'm makin' love to you Bianca
Can't you see I ain't you seein' what I mean
I got plenty and mean streets my team tweaks
So my future seems bleak
Take a peak at me I ain't happy she got me
Under child social services and shit for bein' a slacky pappy
My khakis are low saggin' from illio type little bags
Pushin' ten of them on top of the world like James Cagney
Feel that agony
People naggin' me
My raggedy life ain't worth livin', sick of my aunt and uncle draggin' me
See me drink my life away, smokin', tokin' my life away
Tryin' to put this trife away in the deepest darkest hide away
If I could fly today to the Golden Gates
I could get away from this place of hell and fakes
But it might be too late
What it gonna be
D-E-A-D
Another S-T-A-T-I-S-T-I-C that's me
Puffin that stronger W double E-D that hunger
Don't know how much longer I'll be on this Earth
'Cause I'm the worst type of nigga on this here turf
So disperse

[Chorus]
The worst, the worst yeah
They keep tryin' to pull me under
But I been to long tryin' to make it over
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do

[Verse 3]
That's why I say
F-A-H-Q
If you ain't crew
Some busters on my hit list betta hope it ain't you
My pockets thin
About to sin
I got to spend
About like 10
To get that Henn
To make that blend
To make that fool come up out his ins
Devilish thoughts
Hell is feelin' kinda of crellish
God tell us what we got to do to make the motherfuckin' relish
Spell it, out to me 'cause broke is embarrassin'
I'm psycho like Woody Harrleson
I can make a comparison
Like Aaron Yates
Norman Bates
Perfect mates
Dippin up in Wally Gates
Bitches yellin' head is swellin'
Thinkin' of goin' in hell and bakin' with the beans
Got me fiend
Murder for my green
Seems, I'm cursed not first
The last verse
I burst, into a blood thirst
But what is it worth
No hearse
Nobodies turf
Fuck planet Earth
Disperse
Because you're dealin' with the worst (the worst)

[Chorus]
The worst, the worst yeah
They keep tryin' to pull me under
But I been to long tryin' to make it over
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do
The worst
I know that it can't get no worst
The worst, the worst yeah
After all that I been through
I just don't know what the hell to do
