[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
What it is? What it was? What it shall be?
You tell me, I'm just tryna switch to plan B
Smell me? Get this paper out this rap game
These rappers faking, but yo homie, I be spitting flames
These niggas know me, ain't no phony, I was born to hustle
So watch me get it out this business, watch these pussies struggle
Good in the tussle, flex my muscle, but I'm being subtle
Blitz and befuddle, sendin' rumbles from the [?] muzzle
I gritty guzzle, I goes hard off the liquor bottle
King of my jungle, I worked hard to make it from the bottom
My niggas [?] so regardless, I'ma see figures
This rap thing a simple game, man it's easy nigga
It ain't no [?], tryna sees a nigga
It's open season, ain't no reason nigga, I ain't eatin' nigga
I'm underground and putting it down, I'm just payin' dues
But I'm comin' and I'm [?], I'm a damn fool

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga

[Verse 2: T-Nutty]
Ah! See, I've been creepy crawlin' through the night
Climbin' the wall like Spider-Man [?] went up with me
Come fuck with me
See, I be on another height in the air
Sometimes I be floatin' like a kite, up-uppity
I can't sleep, so money hungry, don't got time to play
Bustin' knocks at the two o'clock in the morning with my grimy face
Before I stepped the foot in the game I had to tie me lace
Just like all of the rest of the niggas just tryna get figures and find some space
Catch me in the cuts, hangin' out like bigger nuts
Nighttime is the right time to dig a hole big enough for you niggas tryna show stop
'Specially on the four block
You can ask my dogs, I'm a hog, not a pork chop
Nutty the black knight, hustle to make the stack right
Creepin' through the dark on you haters, making the mack right
Nigga get your flashlight, you can't see me without it
I doubt it, in a game tryna get something out it

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
I started small town dope game, cocaine
Pushin' rocks on the block, you niggas know me mane
I switched the game and jumped the lane but I'm still goin' hard
I pushed the line, so give me mine, watch you niggas starve
A beast and [?], I'm a heathen, I hear niggas eatin'
So I ain't leavin', I'm proceedin' like a hungry vegan
I'm puttin' cabbage like a savage, let a nigga at it
I got a habit, gotta have it or I'm causin' damage
I'm extra manish, causin' panic like an epidemic
I need your sammich, nigga hand it, you return to famish
Took it for granted, plot and planned it
Now I'm here demandin'
Hella [?], understand it or you get the cannon
Don't get me wrong I ain't speakin' on no hater shit
But I ain't playin', I'm just sayin', I need paper quick
I used to chase it, duckin' cases in the dark of night
But now I chase it in your faces [?] in limelight

[Hook: Tech N9ne & Big Scoob]
I move with the night
I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga

I've been chasing paper, gettin' it, pushin' and makin' moves, nigga
I've been hustlin' all my life
Ever since I can remember, been hustlin' and payin' dues, nigga
