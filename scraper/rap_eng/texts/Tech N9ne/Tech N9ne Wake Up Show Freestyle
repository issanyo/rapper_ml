[Tech N9ne]
I'm just a small town country boy straight from Kansas City
In the midst of evil and you can bet every demon's planning to get me
Lay me down flat, put me in a permanent night sack
We living in them times where the angels loc and they fight back
Showing no love coming at us
Coin no love coming at us
Fight cause my blood really matters
Fight cause my blood really matters
Never will they come from the shoulders so they get guns and they got us
But we be the angels that'll mangle with a millimeter quick they scatter
What you think you know about me, Nina
Alcie, finna
Now he's, meaner
Used to be the nice guy now here he is furious
People get curious
Listen to me and say "He's pretty serious."
Down to dirt, die for the dollars
Angels in Coupes and Impalas
Pray to the gods and the Allahs
Search for the funk when they rob us
See us getting mauled at the mall, home girls really love to mob us
Went to the D. M and the I, doing a gig and the whole place almost got us
Kneel
When you in the good graces of an angel/demon you feel ill
If your spirit ain't real
No sign of inertia the powers looking for a grave to insert ya
What you thinking, what you don't know might hurt ya
Showing no love for the bane
Better make way for the rain
When the rapture really came
Only Tech's legacy remain
Give me that cabbage give me that relish give me money you can keep fame
Get ready for the blood, ready for murder everybody better get ready for the pain

You know? Haha

I remember when Jay-Z was up and he said you made him feel like he want to go to revolution
