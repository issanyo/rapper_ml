(Female voice and Tech N9ne)

The warning of the one who's coming
Claiming divine authority
The prophecy says that people will flaunt to him
He will give them false hope
And when he's in power...he will destroy everything-
He will change everything with one voice...
If that one voice can change one person...
It can change many...
Many can change a city...
A city can change a state...
A state can change a nation...
A nation can change the world...
What if he is the King of Darkness?
