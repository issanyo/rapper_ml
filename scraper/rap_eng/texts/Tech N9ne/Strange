[Intro: Tech N9ne]
The strangest, straight derangest, Stronjay, Stronjay
Uh, MidwestSide... 3DQ found laughin'

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Let's get it on, rap's new phenomenon
Hit 'em up with the flippers and rupture your dome
Me calm down, never you say me song sound like Butch?
You say I'm washed up? Nigga what, what, what?
This is when I kick it, get with this rhythmic Syphilis
Fuck them N9ne rhymes, make 'em go blind every time
On that cannabis, anidous, not for a mini mind
But the mind of a gauge (high)
On stage cause minimum wage has me in a maximum rage
Page ma-ster scrap, velociraptor of rap
See me, come tight like a pig in a bikini
Please! All emcees know I be's on my Q's and P's
Even Run-D.M.C.'s, I'm a deadly disease
High voltage, just take a look at the psychosis
Deranged, I claim, damaged plane, atrocious
Flows be constant, I rock from here to Wisconsin
My killer flows makes me jerk my Johnson

[Hook]
He's strange and I like it
He's strange just the way he is
Tecca Ninna, Tecca Ninna (What's up?)
Why you so damn psycho? (Couldn't tell you, baby)
(Makin' rella, baby, flippin' hella, baby)
(Ask your nearest fortune teller, baby)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Mushroom headed, keeps me prophetic
But the slow-motion makes me see life like a movie
The bombay brother with the ganja stickin it
Gonna stick it if you let it
Come here, but no calming Aaron Donte'
I'll run dancing
Just call me the strange or Stran-g√©, bombay
Distinguishing the kcuf of tihs
From hip-hop come this
Apocoflips got control of your hips
Its venomous, how the rap metamorphasis
MC corpses is around me
They found me jacuzzin with my sorceresses
Fire up the vapor, get blowed
And roll to a spot with biancs
Then bust holes and they over
So different, they wanna kill me like they killed Bruce Lee
On the set, no shit
Saw my bianca with baguettes
Middle West flex flows, likes to sex those
Little Wet flesh holes, insane brain games
Never that plain Jane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I give myself a C-section with a rusty jagged weapon
Bungee wit 100 feet of slack
In front of my kids with no discretion
Strange days like Julia Lewis and Angela Bassett up in a casket
Trippin with the 9
Get your brain blown like a head gasket
Missouri is in the house for the '99 shot
Futuristic ladies love me a whole whole lot
When demons try to do me too
They know they wicked
So I bust and if you ain't down with IIIDQ
Who are you!?!
Nina Tech, respect, MidWest Side
For life, grab a mic, and hurt ya like a lavia commercial
The soundlab got my microchip screwed
Malfunction, ?, now I'm cool
Pain givers, slang spitters, hang niggas, insane triggas
No shame, aim triggas, brain brain splitters
Vein slitters, Gain critters, Dame hitters
Wayne livers, narcotical strange nigga!

[Hook]
