[Hook] (x2)
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Down for the block like Shaq O'Neil
Me and my niggas hitting corners in the Batmobile
My block so hot so keep you enough shots
You slip and you fall niggas get chalked like hopscotch
On my block, I'm in cahoots with what's going on
Take me out the hood but the hood will never leave me
I'm holding on as if I'm falling off the edge of a cliff
If I live to see 80, I'm reppin' the bricks
Real shit, leaning like a syrup sipper
Henny and sprite mix it up get a cup nigga
Pour out some liquor for my niggas who ain't living on the surface
After the bottle we load our clips and put in work
Block shit stay in the house when they set tripping
A hundred rounds hit niggas and wet women
East side 9-double-0-5-9
Watts, California, I ain't hard to find
Shit, I'm down for the block

[Hook]
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block (Kutt Calhoun: Ay)
Down, down for the block

[Verse 2: Kutt Calhoun]
I'm down for the block like I'm down for my wife
And if you niggas fuck with either, then it's down with your life
I got no mercy for you fuck-ups or the way that you behave (All Blood)
And represent that from the cradle to the grave
On my block when we was taught you had to get it how you spit it
Shoot blocks and throw rocks, hawk spit or talk shit
Killer City better watch ya, might get set up by some hoes
Better do what Alvin Ailey do and stay up on your toes
Got the deuces and the Dre's click-clacking in the pain
A hard method of survival try to shake it but ya can't
Rather win, lose or draw, stand your ground and hold your weight
And if you still can see your ribs, get ya weight up, quit your hate
'Cause niggas know when in a food fight you wouldn't bust a grape
Spike clicks probably better off chopping with the K
I'm down for my block and I love my town
So, Killer City stand up and Kutty Cal can stay hound
SuWoo

[Verse 3: Big Scoob]
Say the word, watch me rush your shit
I'm the realest motherfucker with this Stranged out clique
Suck the willa on the realer, I ain't playing with you niggas
Godzilla with the milla get to spraying at you niggas
Yeah, check my history, nigga, when you mention me
Bet they say I'm in the street, rider nigga for the V
Fuck the industry, fucking what you think of me
I don't give a fuck, bet you pussies be respecting me
I love the block, 'cause my sign in the prime time
You niggas faked your steady lying in your fucking rhymes
Saw a nigga, hella twisted off the R nigga
Gutter butter, I be seeping like a ball nigga
Desert eagle for the people, I be busting lethal
We on the cola from the soldier, but this all legal
For the block, I'll be screaming villain non-stop
5-6 on a mission, take it to the top

[Hook]
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
Ay, red drawers, red socks, red everything
Look what they've done to me crazier than I've ever been
Like I needed medicine, I don't think it's eratapheme
That is seen, second lettering
This ho-head plus wanted me to rep the block
Sadly, I missed the block
Badly, and the ones that came before me Dr. Bop and Rock
Daddy, plus being surrounded by real niggas was my big thrill
'Cause I was walkin' by stand-up niggas from 5-6 Ville
They helped me get my cheese up, love my K-I-D's much
Thats why I would never freeze up when its time to throw B's up
We need a Jesus to relieve us when millies bust
Now we're over seas plus with euros and visas
58th, 57th, 56th, 55th
That's my area and I rep it with the quick
How many homies it be grips and they on the sippy trip
Down for the block and it's the same shade
As the homie Mitchy Slick, nigga

[Hook] (x2)
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down for the, for the
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
Down, down for the block
