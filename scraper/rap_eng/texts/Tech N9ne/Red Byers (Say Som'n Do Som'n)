[Intro: Big Scoob]
Say som'n, do som'n, that's the way that I was raised
But we living in different ways nowadays
But no matter what you was taught
Every man must hold his own

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Pac told me, "Reach the block, homies"
When the thot's know me then you get guacamole
Still gotta watch police even if you got dough these
Haza's will not scold me, 'cause I am not Toby
I am a king, I made my mark on this planet, I am cha-ching
That's my Asian name, I get dough from rhymin' supreme
I was poor, now I am a thing, I was low as slime in latrines
That's amazin' man, I put the 'woop' on it, a few moments
Then you gon' get a new song with 'soo-woo' on it
The youth want it in groups to use the loop on this
A bad man, that's what I am, an odd one
Never ask me what your broad done
I'ma say to the brethren Wagwan
Solid as Haile Selassie, so it's nobody to stop me
Plus I got Maudie to watch me, free from the thottie's debauchery
Stay away from fed's wires, come fake with us and you gonna get lead fired
'Cause we known to say som'n, do som'n (what?), Red Byers

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
And if I ever started to fall
I'd land with both feet on the ground, makin' me ten feet tall
Looking like, "Wassup now?" Say som'n, do som'n
"Wassup now?" Say som'n, do som'n
Ah me? Say som'n, do som'n
Still OG Say som'n, do som'n

[Bridge: Big Scoob]
If I said it I meant it, this how I live
I'll die for it, that's how I am

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You can't send a suburban black or white cop who never been to the hood, to the hood
'Cause the perception they get from all the killings on the TV ain't never good, in the hood
So it's nervous when they give service, no courage can lead to murders
The squirters make them assertive and I heard it can't be refurbished
When the word is "We deserve it" 'cause someone alerted
We flirted with purges, leavin' us dead and deserted
Permanently dirted, inserted in a pine box, I'm not dyin' shot
Tryna make my time stop, N9ne got them slimes that mind pop
And they never do dime drop, born on N9ne' block to crime dot
Then the rhymes locked, where they find bop
I can still walk on Highland, walk on Wayne, claimin' what I ought to claim
Soft and sensitive simple suckers, they take the walk of shame
Heads wire, like if they bled, ours, the dead flyers
Because we say som'n, do som'n, Red Byers

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko & Tech N9ne]
And if I ever started to fall
I'd land with both feet on the ground, makin' me ten feet tall
Looking like, "Wassup now?" Say som'n, do som'n
"Wassup now?" Say som'n, do som'n
Ah me? Say som'n, do som'n
Still OG Say som'n, do som'n

[Bridge 2: Big Scoob]
All I got is my name
Long as my name is good, I'm good

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Feel evil, really though, sinister shit for illy blokes
Who milly tote for silly folks, bustin' 'til they chilly most
Kill these broke enemies, finna be until he croaks
Leavin' 'em wrapped in a drilly coat
Crossin' him with a chin like a billy goat
We talk this way 'cause we been through so much
Impossible to have no guts
Anybody fakin', we say hold up, we got our street and city sewed up
That's from all the fightin' and bumpin', we found the light in the sunken
Hole, down is plight and dysfunction, plowed us right into something
Hours frightin' and then funkin' but the cowards pryin' and punchin'
And the pal is tryna trump him, now we flyin' and bumpin'
Flyin' higher than med tryers, we bred sires and they bed lie-ers
They get nothing and we got everything, Fred Meyer
I salute the triple OG, Red Byers
