[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]

Thuggin on other planets
Plucking my black antennas
Listening for freelancers
They're biting my style and famish
I don't allow the cameras
I don't allow the managers
I just break down the answers and hope humanity handles it
This is no radio fluke
This is me taking yo food
This is you bullied in school
Give up yo jacket and shoes
This how I practice the rules
This is what happen when dudes
Like flying lotus notice the genius that wrote it is rude
You just promote it
I diagnosed it with viruses too
Microphones open and plug is running inside of Pro Tools
How can I dodge you buffoons?
I could collide a kaleidoscope with the stars and the moon
The moment I morph in my mood
These are gorges of tune
Police report it then try to sort it with criminal views
This is intentional fuel
For the fireball dragon
Fire shots when you wrestling
AK over the dash and I vacate with the Jurassics
The jungle the wicked masses
The sabertooth 80 proof
On my breath this the look of death
This an antique Mercedes coupe
Yes....
Buffalo soldiers at war
You shot fast but that ain't the final score
Buffalo soldiers at war
You shot fast but that ain't the final score
