[Verse 1]
I got the mental capacity to rap for the entire life
By the fire fueled by the eye of desire;
Mystical, fickle, flicking up fiction by
Gripping my sickle, sticking into pickles
That come with the biggah picture
Ooo, riding high on the ripples
First I admire the climb
But then retreat due to cyclical bickering between
The voice in my head
And all this love that I've been fed
My people, do you call this living
Or are you living dead?
Am I the only soul holding on hope and [naturalness?]
Fed up with the get ups
Addicted to sonic [thoughts?] and [leather number two?]
Mumbling humbly with bubble gum stuck under my shoe;
So attached on this mother with these motherfuckin' bumblers
Droppin' the ball 'stead of tryin' to see they name on the wall
Disappointing all who are involved
Devolving on and walking tall
As if Stephen Hawking's talking 'bout nothing at all
Let me tell ya'

[Hook]
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, 7, repeat x4
Is it just my i-ma-gi-nay-tion
Or is this life
As crazy as it seems?
Oh, this must be a dream
Some day I will [come by a star?]
And wake up while
The clouds are far behind me
I'll travel the world like [?]
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

[Verse 2]
Limitless dimensions
I defend my ascension
Like advantageous rage
On pages [ripped?] at conventions
Thereby establishing the new realm
To be explored
Good food and education our only things we can afford;
But are the main concern
Gotta be healthy and learn about the history
Tomorrow should be the only mystery
Because here in the land of the peasants
We love the gift of life of now
And that is why we call it the present
In essence, we are confused, alone, and abused;
Accepting the perception that we have nothing to lose
But what is to gain
If from lessons you abstain?
All pain, no change in the game
Let me tell ya'

[Outro]
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, 7, repeated
I whip my hair back n' forth
I whip my hair back n' forth
I whip my hair back n' forth
I whip my hair back n' forth
I whip my dreads back n' forth
