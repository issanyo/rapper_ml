[Captain Murphy]
Someone has to pay today
Someone's gotta pay the bills
I can't even look in the mirror
Oh baby would you get my pills?
I need a xanny and a vicodin
A percocet and valium
Anything to take the edge away
I travel through the light in the ceiling and everything goes away
I look inside my mind and dream
About the worlds inside my eyes
I look inside my mind and dream
About the worlds inside my eyelids

[Outro]
I know of a place inside my mind where I can fly!
(Take another pill! take another pill!
Take another pill and I go, where I go no one knows)
I know of a place inside myself where I can be!
(Take another pill! take another pill!
Take another pill and I go, where I go no one knows)
I know of a place inside my mind where I am free!
(Take another pill! take another pill!
Take another pill and I go, where I go no one knows)
