(INTRO)
[Sound clip from a WWI shell shock documentary]

[Verse 1]
Uhh my bad again I apologize
When I try to keep it together it falls apart like Henny's skies
(Henny Penny)
I'm in my prime, no need for Optimus
I'm Kobuto
(Who are you though?)
Oh, now you fossilized?
(Fuck that!)
Life gave me lemons, I wiped them on my floors
So a pledge to all the times that bind these poor chores
(Or?!)
A toast to those who boast about fur coats and shiny yachts
Spat like the Skoal from an Aussie's snot
(Hehehe)
Get off my cock, I'm incognito
Sippin' Pelegrino
With immigrant latinos
Sweating from placebos
Acids are amino
Of course there's weed smoke
Heat coals, peep those weak flows

(BRIDGE)
(Ehh?)
I'm so bored
(What the fuck?)
That didn't make any sense
(Um?)
Who fuckin' cares

[Sound clip from a WWI shell shock documentary]

[Verse 2]
I'm flyer than Miles Prower
While crashing through double towers
Listen
Sit and
Shittin'
Spittin'
*SPITS*
Hehe
I peep those knots in wedged trousers
Why did Eustace tear Courage to create such cowards?
(Umm?)
Imagine Galaga
Painted like what the palette does
(I'm pass the stars)
Burns like the boss' rug
(Hehehe)
Look you scared when you hear the chuckles
Tattered claws, scarlet dreads and walk around with bloody knuckles
Invaders Must Die so we joined The Prodigy
Life's a dick, fucks you like what is pornography
So
Get folded like origami through Swastika Nazis
Can't see undercover like cops Islamic modesty

Heh, honestly

(OUTRO: Ermac from Mortal Kombat (2011))
We are many, you are but one
