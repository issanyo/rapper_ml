[Intro: WoLF]

HaHaHaHaHaHa!
(Heheheheh)

[Verse: WoLF]
See Me Now ,See Me Later

I'm in the park chillin' with
Big Foot on a back of an
Alligator
I'm an astronaut in danger
I'm an Illegal alien to a stranger
I'm Hoof Seven ,The Hallucinator

Do me a favor and don't do me
No favors
Merge the Major (Damn...)
Assassinator
Bow & Arrow ,Pitchfork ,Wand
, Sword and a Sniper

Jumps off the Eiffel Tower and
Lands with a box a pizza on
The Tower of Pizza
You ask me some ,I give you
One (one of 1 of them is none)
Couldn't reach you! Because
The helicopter propeller almost
Cut my head off!..
So I slipped and fell off and
Landed on the MOON
(((Oow....))) (HaHaHaHaHaHa)
(Stars ,Telescopes and shit
Couldn't even see us)
(Hahahahah-hehehehe-aheha)
*coughing*

[Verse: MAD 7akc]
I'm a Bad Dream Gone Bad
With a gun stuffed in her A$$
Faster than flash tryna' laugh
(But Why Would He Laugh?)
I don't know ,why would you
Ask?
You stupid A$$ ,the one with
The Mask ,that smacks faster
Than the girl with the gun up
Her A$$
(Nope)
Not Flash again ,the same
Guy who ran by with the
Lazy Leg (eg...eg...)
