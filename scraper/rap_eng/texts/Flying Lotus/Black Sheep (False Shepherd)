[Intro]

[adlib: Kuro Silence]
Yeah, Yeah
Mmm, ahh
Uh huh

[Verse 1: Kuro Silence]
They had to silence all the lambs cause the
Sheep started barking

A wolf in black wool to keep the children's
Mind from darkening

Talking to the others watching trouble as it's stalking you lost in the world and the spin started blocking you, revelations or epiphanies got them clocking you, thought that you was nice so they got themselves a Glock or two

Brought them to your house and told your family to howl for you said that you'd be dead if they got themselves an hour or two

Tormenting heads like the feds making red green is obscene with a following of lead

Follow those who lead to people who took from culture bled the people without rest and call it torture then rigor mortis a sickened odor that was the body of the olders I know they told us a poison road thus this

Rose dust with pedals that test our mettle with caskets body baskets for the rebels revel in fictitious ignition like stones and pebbles I'm clever so I never follow orders to the letter test my mettle I told you niggas not to meddle

Yeah I'm the motherfucking Devil

*Gun shot*
