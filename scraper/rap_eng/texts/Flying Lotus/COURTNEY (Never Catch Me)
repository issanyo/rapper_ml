Dressed up in all white they thinking celebration
Deaf cuz they can't hear their father's deprecation
Want to squeeze the trigger but there's some hesitation, meditation, quick wait hold on what will we lose here
He got saggy jeans and a durag we can lose him
Remove him, don't think twice just shoot him
He can jump high, we can use
The nba will approve him, give him money then confuse him
When he washed up we'll excuse him
Just think about it
Confused them at the pulpit
Give the big cars to the cool kids
Gold chains to the cool kids
XXX and skin flicks, malt liquor addiction
Cocain make it foolproof, we go fool them, we go fool them
King Kong when we catch a nigga
King Kong lets catch a nigga
Shoot em down in the daylight just make sure he a ratchet nigga
My soul white, my neck red, won't hesitate to cap a nigga
It's all love for the butterfly but it's all shells for the caterpillars
They don't have a thesis, they don't understand they thesis
No more Michael Jackson remix, No more Michael Jordan defense
Can't have Martin Luther preaching, without Malcolm X pre-fix
Can't have Barack Obama book bag, without Trayvon hood straps
See you hate me when I'm here, you're going to hate me when I'm gone
You can't love me when I'm weak but then hate me when I'm strong
No more rock-n-roll and jazz clubs and cotton fields in America
Everything about yo white christmas will be pitch black once we're gone!
