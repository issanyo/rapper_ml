[Verse 1: Sus Boy 3000 (pizza boy.)]
The problem with existing, personified in back sweat
Walk outside to get reminded I’m the Black threat
Walk outside to get reminded, as a Black kid, I am undesirable to nerd or otherwise, it goes as such:
No matter if it’s hood or Hyrule flow
Zelda lovers think I’m stupid, hood chicks want me slow
White guys are the safe choice and the standard
Painfully reminded; playfully, I banter
Yet another self-talk, self-deprecation
Filling out the Bed, Bath, and Beyond application
I’m so self-aware; I know I’m so out of place
Right outside the store, like, “What I know about drapes?!”
I should run ‘em
Because the silent exchange when they run the card says they think I would anyway
I think my pube stank betrays my GPA
ETA for hygiene assumptions: 0:58
What a hot day; it’s hot up in the 6
Give me 66 for a temp, and then keep away LaVey
Hellfyre in the 'phones, raising Kane like Paul Bearer
This bloody fart smells like brimstone

[Verse 2: Big Sus Boi (Shampoo Papi)]
Fuck this rap shit, I'm on my iPhone app shit
Tap shit, gettin' more money than a mattress
On my rap shit, like...
"Fuck this rap shit! I'm an activist, sipping Actavis"
All ball, Paul Wall and you pussies get smoked like a Pall Mall
Wi-Fi fly guy, on the web like a fly when I die
I pen a couple metaphors and rap tropes
And try to pass it off like I rap dope
Say what? I don't say the same stuff
Don't let me give off the impression that I ain't tough
Don't let 'em paint you as a bitch or a snitch
Or a meme or a trend or a name on a list
Fuck Complex, I don't get the context
I deal with concepts if we're being honest
Well, I tried it, then...
Put me up on Pitchfork, no Leviathan
