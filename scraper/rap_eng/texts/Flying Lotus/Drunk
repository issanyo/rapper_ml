[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
Till I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Verse]
Morning heartache
Senses your love
I just can't catch a break
Squirrels and snakes keep me on my toes
Will you go down with me?
Don't care what you say
So many feels, bro
LOL, I'm so over it
'Cause nothing is real
I'd rather be up my mind
Than to be dead alive

[Chorus]
Drowning away all of the pain
Till I'm totally numb
Sometimes you want to feel alive
But not on someone else's time

[Outro]
(Baby) I just can't catch a break
