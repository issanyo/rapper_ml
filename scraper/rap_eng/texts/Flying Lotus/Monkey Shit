[Verse: Langston Thoreau]
I'm hanging on the side of a building
With a white woman in my hand... (Sportsman)
Knock down fighter pilots like I'm rector
First time you heard me, I'm a freshman
My 'cane is adjacent with lessons, no questions
All patience, the pain when we're tested
Seventh day restin', write for all six
Back up on the bike like I never lost it
I'm talking 'bout flight with a mic and a pen
And dream with a drive kept alive with the win
Again against the wall and a bucket with the crabs
Taught many skills when I grew, dropped a mag
But I got it back when I walked with a chimp like
A pimp when he limped, when I talk with my dick
I never figure out, but I shout it with my mouth
East coast feel but my hustle's down south
Sitting stateside but my mind's out the house
No doubt I'm playin' beans, this is what I'm all about
Dollars make sense, let the rent, get paid
Dream of spaceships but for now its paper planes
Dollars make sense, let the rent, get paid
Dream of spaceships but for now its paper planes
