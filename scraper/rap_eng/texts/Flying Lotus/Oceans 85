[Michael Anthony]

Tell me Tell me Tell me Tell me something
Drag a square Crack a smile the lames were frontin
Round table
Our Coalition
Surprise attack, on the opposition
Take whatever we want x2

Oceans 85': The Heist

May the joints i burn Through light the way, may the mark get touched slow kill then slip away x2

Were all Assassins inside Rise to the occasional blood Shed the occasional blood shed....


[Kami: Verse 1]
Smoke one
For me

Id probably die in a ditch
If they got to pick it
Till then we living a picture
Pulp Fiction to be specific
In that case its golden
Diamonds for the finer tatse
Brandy, Wine
Or
Sip that slow
To Screw up your
Designer face
Catch us in the act
Acting like a nigga
Wish he could
Retired on islands
We Talk specifics on the what we shoulds
Kami Kami Kami
Call me Tony! Toni! Ton√©!
You could ask around about me
Got you feelin like you know me
Like I got one of them faces
Like I caught one of them cases
That you read bout in the paper
I be ballin like a baby
They be on me like I'm Kobe
In the 90s with a jump shot for the finish
Right in front me was the center with arms up...

They love me

Ocean's 85: The Heist


[Kami: Verse 2]

Here's a case of rocket launchers
Show you what to do with them
This is just a movie pilot
Probably end up shooting ya
Not withstanding the test of time
Them homeboy he supposed to ride
Don't get caught lacking when it's cold outside
Thats An easy win for the oppo side
Here's a crunch bar
Treat yourself to dinner
Then of course you'll need a dentist
Doc the med will kill the patience
That's no matter what you tell em
40 cals they'll calibrate ya
6 degrees well separate ya
Sixty feet you separated
6 below "they never made it"
Tired of retaliation
Tally ho let's go
Fasho
Keep a bitch dome educated
Keep a bitch domesticated
If not Let me escalate that
Elevated it
We High as hell we
We Suffocating
No boy no resuscitation
You ain't never coming back
Just  told you that
So act up
Watch them boy react we
Aiming at ya pancreas
Them stomach holes
Yo hungry ass
Kami Chukwu
De so co co
Going contra
On the contents of ya college
Where his concious
He's a monster
On a rampage
Who could stop him....
