(Verse 1) Prince Hekima Bakersman
Listen I’m a marijuana fiend/and I’m more faded than a homeless man’s pair of jeans/ me with woman nah I wear my heart on my sleeve/and have it rolled up like I do my weed/and my rolled up sleeve means /I gotta get to work cause I have a failed application from cput/now im falling back on my plan A to chase my dream/of being the rapper of cpt/no disrespect to these other broke mcs/but yall punchline like sassa funds yall get it but I don’t get it/hahaha get it/ im only getting  better and better since being fired  by checkers/
(Chorus)PH.b
Somebody do something
Oh my nigga please (x Infinite)
(Verse 2) PH.B
Cassio on ay arm fiends see a two month supply of tik are now watching me/ but can't fuck with me cause I’ll get up in that ass like Johnny mongrels dick giving them a colonoscopy/the white lies told by black politics/it don’t worry me/ but smoke a blunt and you’ll see/the world in high definition quality/because your on high on quality/moms took me out the ghetto but not the ghetto outta me/ K.O any rapper with my punchlines /if you didn’t get that you probably metrorail delayed if you didn’t get that line/if your radio station ain't playing my songs then im changing platforms like a dime/
(chorus)
(Verse 3) Nolan
I started as a kid man just tryna spit bars/the sky is the limit I wanted to be with the stars/lets forget about the past and all of the shit that happened/and focus on now so I can prove I’m a better rapper/ and spit 16 bars like a reservoir /so high/the only way that you can find it is if you sky dive/fuck v-necks I wanna put me and my crew on/verses means business so my time should have a suit on/I show you the ropes and make a tie around your neck/like a fucking coin toss im coming for your head/
(Chorus)
