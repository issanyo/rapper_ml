[Verse 1]
Yo
My bass is so heavy when I dropped it it thud
But the only product that you ever drop was a dud
I'm off in the cut
Popping em off like inter changeable
Spray paint caps the pink dot stay bangable
Quickly switching to yellow and I'm out-lining
The fact that the game full of lames that I'm out shining
Out rhyming
8 bars in I murdered ya image and I'm a white kid that came from a village enough of that
Already got em hook line and sinker
They couldn't even touch it with a twenty foot finger
Excuse me
Let me rap and let me kill it
Plus Dylan holding heat like the handle of a skillet
Rossman and the volunteers the crew is major
Big Dogs round the puppies up for Youth in Asia
And I'm serving all these women a miracle dong
I'm on tapes flipping words like lyrical pugs
Satirical law when I'm shuffling through my notebooks
Long monosyllabic verses with no hooks
All of that backpack rapping is an old look
It's Twenty Ten so get out of the house and go look
And if you get buck homie then go jook
Dylan make bread without pulling out a toaster
Innovative innovation
Like I'm supposed ta
Get you in love with the innovatively flowing prouh
Innovatively Flowing prouh huh?

[Verse 2]
D Ross the pro to flow right
I'm still rocking a beard that can not grow right in
So by the stubble of my chinny chin chin
Imma leave a motherfucker lost like Gilligan
Never militant. No
I am on my own
Whether I'm making a beat or freaking on a microphone
I keep it nasty sorta like dirty undies
Dirty crusty
Until it smell really funky
Bass chunky
Deep dirty drums
Never fuck a bitch if she give you dirty thumbs
I keep it dirty dumb like bad parenting
Married to the game but I never wear a ring
I am barreling through
Nations ahead of time and space
Yet these motherfuckers underestimate me
I know why you hate me
I know you why you wanna be Dylan Zachariah cause he flow so crazy
Yeah Dylan Ross versus Flying Lotus
What up Ohio, I see you
What up Vancouver, I see you
And everyone else in between
I don't literally see you
But I appreciate all the love and support
So let's keep this thing going
All new fresh buck junts for spring 2010
It's on
