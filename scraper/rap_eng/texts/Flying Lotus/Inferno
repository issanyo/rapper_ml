[Hook]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

[Hook]
Into the fire
Black skies filled with smoke
Darker horizons ahead (that's right)

[Chorus]
Out of the pan and into the fire
The descent into madness
Bright as day, dark as night
The inferno

[Outro]
Welcome to the madness, madness
Leave your mind at the door, check out
Madness, madness
