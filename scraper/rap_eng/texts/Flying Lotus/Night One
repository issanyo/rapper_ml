[Verse #1]

Got a different type of vibe
When I'm in a close mile to ya radius
Radio singles don't make ya, they mistake ya
For some avarage Afrodite, unapologetic kinda
Un-stereotyped vibration, I'm tuned to ya
I made my room for ya, hopin that I could please ya taste
Get in the do' and open it, soak it in as I ease ya legs
No hope for no horoscope, like co-ckaroach pokin' her toe
She got scared by the inches, I'm a inch away
From her spirit, lay her down and astral project
Ass to mouth, yes, make her laugh while the sex in progress
Tell a joke on her pussy, I'm just kiddin' her
I'm just skinnin' her alive, ain't no better demise
Ain't no better description, ain't no better, just listen
Same 4 letters and then some great dope lectures through lyrics
Stay gold 'till the case closed, she say I'm her favorite lyricist
In this bitch, no disrespect but I diss respect
Need to lick her neck, lit her up like is dinner, that's
Just a way of sayin' it, shit I made this off of eatin' tracks
Beatin' cats like a dog, with the mighty wolf power
I been close so adios, somebody got this hoe un-cowarded
During this 47 days and nights, gotta make it right to make it through
Made it like a maid would do, just the ordered by the Lord so may you
Lay my head to rest on ya breast, or da legs is cool
Make it sexual, from back to back, make her back then ooze
After Day One there's day two, but before you gotta have the night
Before you gotta have tonight, which is the night after Day One
So welcome to Night One

[Hook]

And I don't know why you say that you just can't be here
We just lay and then we play and you say there's no fear
Don't fuck with me or my head, babe I know otherwise
It's by the time you close the two and uncover yo eye

Ain't no other better baby
Ain't no other better baby (x2) [x4]

[Verse #2]

Wasted and sedated
Wit an outdated playlist
Always faded, face fainted from a raisin on a outrageous racist
Hit him a brick and shit him a finished blunt
And sizzle on lil syrup, fill up my tenderous gut
Intimate drugs, with it adjust my liver, liquor down crust
Feelin' out us, she down to lick it without a doubt, 5 minute bust
I'll hit her first, down sydrome? Style fittin' a little much
Cowboy prism, foul toys ringin', around this fickle slut
She lookin at me like her daddy, I'm at it like ravioli
Pattin' only the greatest on they backs, in her ass I'm the mad emoji
Holy moly guacamoli, holy waters couldn't drown this fire
My saliva much more drier but she still like it
Not really a writer but a rioter on the system
Income, been this numb since my first kick drum
Was oblit-etared, and my dick was paved in
With her clit, impacient for me to slap that big bum
I'm a big bang product, I'm prouder then anyone
Nobody's allowed to be louder, the style is just too much
On her puss I'm possessed, pose as dope? Death
No treath, left my breath stankin' with that cat on slow sex
