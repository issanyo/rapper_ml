[Intro: Cap Stylez]

[Verse 1: Cap Stylez]
I don't know where I'm goin, but like the last bowling pen standing
Up, would you spare a moment? Call me Cap from Far Away Land, but it's like I'm floating to the stars in Space Jam. Even if you have the tightest
Barber in the world, life is hard to fade, man
Stress is just a stealth knife; it scars your brain and the feeling's
Bittersweet to me, but I'll be happy when I rid the world of
Rappers tryna act out the part to spray cans
My ship been passed that vessel, cause Clockwork
Doesn't change, even if I had a bezel
Mentally these rich folks with levels will never be at my level
I'm with angels and gods and everyday we slap the Devil
When we're sparkin', we're in the garden. Every verse I
Write is written arson. My life, it hits the hardest
I would die to hit a target, and even if I
Don't, Ima try to live regardless. Tommy Pickles
With a paintbrush in his hand; this kid's an artist
With the vision to steer in darkness

[Hook: Cap Stylez]

(La, la, la, la) Ima go anywhere I wanna go
(La, la, la, la) Ima go anywhere I wanna go

[Verse 2: Cap Stylez]
Ima go anywhere I wanna go
TRW4Eva got a hundred flows. See we're headed to the
Bread, I'm eating butter rolls. Spent some time in Earth
C cause b*tches come and go. Naming rivers after
Me because they love the flow
