Y'all niggas ain't fucking with me
It's the return, I got a bone to pick
Niggas get burned like foliage
Holy shit, the coldest shit
It's Sailor in my coke and shit
And I got next like
Pass the controller stick
Took a hiatus
Now I'm back, hi haters
Don't you dare violate us
Cause the grind here is so legit
Even though they won't admit
I'm hot, and I know the shit
Dreads still growing and
All the hoes notice it
I'm through stressing over school til August
Want to rap, but I act
Like I'd rather be in college
Degree in engineerin'
Is all that my parents hearin'
Scholarship academic assistin' me with tuition
Gifted like my first bike around Christmas
Pedal through the hood just trying to find mischief
Knowing damn well I'm a misfit
Conflicted
Was brilliant, surrounded by ig'nant little niglets
Moved to the burbs where the white kids been
Received a pound cake the day we moved in
"Welcome to the boondocks, and it'll be smooth
We wave Confederate flags
But we cool with coons."
And now, all these white kids
Got droopy eye-lids
Popped a Molly Cyrus
She's perspirin'
It's clouds of loud all about outside
And the cops don't get called
Til the neighbors despise it
Effortless flight, that's auto-pilot
But gas is so high
That it stints my mileage
And most bad bitches got height requirements
Giving me the blues
But it's more like violet
Spitting from the side
Where the nerds reside
It's Charm
Eyes drawn like curtains now
I got a stupid flow
Try to see working in a cubicle
Followed by hip hop's funeral
I'm pissed like urinals
And fearing no obstacle
Danger is assured, to be afraid is optional
Started from the bottom like a basement and garage
It's Carlos, no mirage
I'm real, I'm no optical, illusion
Spent four summers just kicking it in New Men's
Went to Tuskegee
And they put me in Bethune
And I repped the Ham
I was an idol like Ruben
Now I make moves
The Monastery's the movement
