[Intro: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Yo
Aye, yo
It's your boy, Zarathustra
Coming to you live from a cabin in Canada, yo

[Hook: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Free yourself and others
Yourself and others
Free yourself and others
Make cannabutter
Free yourself and others
And love your mother
Free yourself and others
And never harm another

[Verse 1: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Hi dude, I'm Alan watts with talon thoughts
Crafting poems and palindromes: top mood doom pot
Who would of thought he could be so mindless
Platonic ideal smartphone, post a vine with a Samsung Galaxy
In the Milky Way galaxy
While watching the galaxy
Actually do that actually
Then laugh away maladies
A cavalry of Anthony Fantanos gallantly and valiantly dismantles me
But that meat was not me so now I be free, hehe, ha
Hehe

[Hook: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Free yourself and others
Yourself and others
Free yourself and others
Make cannabutter
Free yourself and others
And love your mother
Free yourself and others
And never harm another

[Verse 2: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Yo, water changes form but it does not die
We are water and we already live in the sky
So I guess we're kinda fly and eternal
I'm Dogen philosophizing at the urinals in a Wendy's bathroom in Talahassee
To see me need double-eyelids, epicanthoplasty
Fantasto-nasty, heck of stelliferous
Do not forget to, uh, inject Chip tha Ripper with vaccines for Ebola and Typhoid
"Well done, m'boy, you noticed the sky void"
Nice choice, best to look up, analog dictionary
Rush Limbaugh, Sears catalog, Pictionary
What do these things have in common?
"Who cares!?"
If I trafficked in horses, I'd move mares
I'm new here, have you seen this fuckin planet shit?
Where the fuck are we, and what's all this matter shit?
Mother Theresa at the helm of a battleship
I am precisely a cadaverage dude
In a cavernous room playing a masterful flute
Life is a cancerous womb
And that's actually cool
Yeah, yeah
You could dance to jazz music and lamp with advanced Buddhists
Depants finance students lambast entranced nudists
Then become one and beg forgiveness
In a parallel universe, homeless Donald Trump is playing Quidditch, ha

[Hook: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
Free yourself and others
Yourself and others
Free yourself and others
Make cannabutter
Free yourself and others
And love your mother
Free yourself and others
And never harm another

[Outro: LOSTBOYEVSKY]
If we're gaining the powers of gods
Then without the love and wisdom of gods, we self destruct
