Maybe you'll see one day
We'll be free
From fear, from fear, remember my name
I won't forget you, even passing
I know we'll be, don't you forget me
Strange how things work, nothing's promised
Let your heart beat, you'll guide mine
Your guide, always we will survive
I will go on, no need for care
Won't you trust me

I know it's hard when you can't trust
No one, nothing, you can't let love go
You can trust me, I will never, leave you
Right here, always, by your side
Heavy, dare we, got to
Share this love
Who knows maybe we'll learn to fly
