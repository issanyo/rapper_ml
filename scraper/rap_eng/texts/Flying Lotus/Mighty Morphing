[Verse 1]
So they ask me like, “Do you think you'll ever make it?"
I write another rap and say the world is for the taking
But only if you're faking, so I'll take it as it comes
We all seek balance as we wrap around the sun
I'll rap my own thoughts, my notions and emotions
Rap my own thoughts just to silence the commotion
Cause in the ocean of life, your flow's vital
Just like the sound when the needle hits the vinyl
So let the beat Tap into your brain like Spinal
And if you write your own word, no words are final
I'm not a fool, I know I'm not immortal
But for now I'm Still Alive so I’ll play the game like Portal
I find freedom in the back beat
Makes me feel freer than running at a track meet
Ain’t running fast, shooting for the finish line
I'll take my time while I'm waiting for my star to shine

[Verse 2]
I'm saying doe, I'm saying doe
I release this shit for free so you're getting what you're paying for
I transform like a chrysalis
And make the rhymes so damn sick like syphilis
I stay sharp and on point like a sword
I let it all build like the notes on a chord
So I record, I recall, I redeem
I write rap records and realize my rap dreams
Not flying on planes, or selling out the stadiums
Just trying to make it positive like motherfucking radium
Smoke another blunt till the rhymes become blunter
Stare danger in the face like the Crocodile Hunter
