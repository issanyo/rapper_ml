[Verse 1]
So, nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
So where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
So deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help, 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Verse 2]
So somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
So where were you when I needed you the most?
Why in the hell would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
So now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess
