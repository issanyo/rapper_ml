Long days, longer nights, to save what's left of me I gotta write 
Sometimes I wonder what if I don't succeed, what if don't go Lebron and straight to league
What if I ain't got the heart, I'm easily fatigued, what if I Len bias, before I make the team
Drugs rule around me. dreams got shot down that's word to the king, as I take this red line to Sheridan
To repent my sins, Then repeat, I swear it never ends, contemplating my rap career in ten years, would I still be here, writing flows that no one hears,
Its a possibility, that they not feeling me, flow get more complex, my context resembles soliloquies
Sometimes I just want to stop trying, set my mind on fire maybe then I'll stop writing
But then again, maybe I just need one more line, to get name on fake shore drive, or 2 dope would post me
Plus if I stop now what am I gonna tell my homies? And plus that feeling of performance leave me dopey
But then I'm tired of these niggas who don't know me acting like they my homies just so they so they be a roadie. And all them sneak dissing dudes man them niggas blow me, mad cause they chicks probably want to blow me.
I never lied in raps. I be hella honest
Inside my head ima' monster but outside I'm hella modest
But if I say I can get her, I can get her, whether or not you with her
If I say that I hit her , then yeah I probably hit her
But I ain't the type to brag on the chicks I bag, its better to move in silence, real niggas know that
And to the next girl, who I'mma possibly do bad, blame it on my ex girl , who took the only heart had
These girls be only rocking with me cause I rap, well I hope the cash they see in me is the cash im gone have
So my dad, won't have to work, and my mom can just relax, buy my tun a Ferrari, bring kola on the red carpet, let my sister pop tags, and put that man booth in a jag, party all night and just throw it on my tab
But probably could of been straight if I stuck to track, but instead of running laps on these tracks
Life of a broke rapper ,catch me doing free shows, surrounded by freak hoes, taking shots like free throws
On road to success well at least I think so
Hope I make to the goal before my dreams get repo'd
