[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Fragmented memories
Sentences incomplete
That's when she said
"Don't wanna put up a fight anymore
I'm down to the end of my rope
And I'm freefalling
I'll search inside myself
I need to know why I act this way"
A whisper turns to a scream
I can't ignore it no more

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby, that's how it goes

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
From my eyewitness binoculars (uh-huh)
To Argentina and Africa (uh-huh)
We mastered the (what?) pressure (yeah)
Hazardous (uh-huh), harassing us (that's right)
You laugh at us (you did)
More accurate at bagging dimes, now we bagging rhymes
Bodybags, price tags on your forehead
Nine times out of ten, young niggas are nine or ten
When the line becomes thin: be a killer or fireman
Fill up the lavish pen if I needed to right my wrongs
I can't deny sin, condolences through these palms
I remember when your cousin was coming home
My bitch, why we plotted to kill him 'cause we ain't know him
Unfamiliar faces make niggas nervous
Convicted court cases might hit the surface
Restricted territories might come through lurkin'
We ain't want none of that urgent call
Well, I'ma act Turk and fall on my identity, percocets
For all the headaches, I'm 'bout to bring confetti
Tumble out this barrel soon as it ring, you ready?
That was the word 'for we moved on 'em
Treat him like Joe the Plumber
I wonder if someone come and can see this tool on him
Immature and retarded is what you call me
Your cousin wa'n't coming home from the pen but from the army
If I can right my wrongs and pen this verse I read
Even though a bullet hit him in the leg, still walk on by

[Chorus: Thundercat]
At the end of it all
No one wants to drink alone
Baby that's how it goes
Don't walk away from me
