[Verse 1 - Jay Arroyo}

They tried fuckin with my mind but now its time to get it
And if you wanna hate just know theres consequences
Burning bridges the difference is I ain't never care
A bunch of people from the past, I just leave'em there
My brother died I still cry about it
Sherrick died I still cry about it
Eric died I still cry about it
I never seen the point in really lyin bout it
Told them I would keep climbing if I find a mountain
But I couldn't see hope, nigga just throw the towel in
Started smiling sex, money, and violence
I couldn't give up cause you know that I love a challenge
This the intro to the shit that I kick
For my niggas baggin up still lightin a spliff
On they last dime talkin bout "I live for this shit"
Told them thats fine cause you know Im just living to live
Forgive and forget? Really ain't a part of my script
So if a nigga do me dirty Imma fuck with this bitch, huh!

[Hook - Jay Arroyo}

My brother died I still cry about it
Eric died I still cry about it
Sherrick Died I still cry about it
I never really seen the point in lyin bout it

{Verse 2 - Jay Arroyo}

My story the pain and glory come for free
And if you dont believe me you can come and see
2013 I used to run the beach
2017 Im tryna run the east
Hit the west coast, you know, probably fuck with G
I started fuckin wit who fuckin wit me
Im tryna own this shit nigga fuck a lease
Put fear in niggas hearts cause love will leave
I put fear in niggas hearts, but love will lead
Just a lone wolf ridin with some troubled sheep

{Hook - Jay Arroyo}

Christian died I still cry about it
Molly died I still cry about it
My heart died I still cry about it
I never seen the point in really lyin bout it

{Verse 3 - Jay Arroyo}

If you wit me then you wit me
If not, them thin lines start to get tricky
An ear they wouldn't lend me and now they wanna act friendly
But its everything they said it'd be and everything I said I've seen
If it wasn't for Ethan wouldn't have bet Breez
If it wasn't for the 8, wouldn't be a me

{Hook - Jay Arroyo}

Justin died I still cry about it
Ethan Died I still cry about it
My heart died I still cry about it
I never seen the point in lyin bout it
My brother died I still cry about it
Eric died they still cry about it
Sherrick died we still cry about it
I never really seen the point in lyin bout it
