Verse 1:
A Hero understands the price of his freedom
He’s willing to pay it with his life twice
If that’s the cost to lead em
...And be a beacon
Ray of hope for the weakened
Prayer spoke for the free men
Way to cope for the beaten
Now, I'm no historian
Never owned a delorean
And I didn't leave school my class’s valedictorian
But…
My last descriptions the prescription and a recipe
For Freedom or for Terror
Let’s explore this intellectually
We vi.olate rights
And call it patriotism
Learn hate for all that’s different
Refusing to pay attention
Mention men like Mandela
And whether you disagree with me
Called a terrorist repeatedly
Sent to jail for dissension
Lest all our conventions
Prevent us from ever mentionin
That part of freedom’s ascension requires applying tension
Requires applying pressure
Requires these dire measures
…. Cuz one man’s freedom is another man’s terror

Chorus:
It's all about what your perspective is
It's all about what your objective is
Just take a moment to reflect on this
You'll realize it's all subjective kid (2x)

Verse 2:
Before “Free Mandela” was ever sang acapella
...The ANC took drastic measures
Fought against their oppressors
Had to take drastic measures
Had to apply pressure
So heads they had to sever
We fight for freedom forever
We voices that refused to be ignored
We rage against injustice
Til our freedom is restored
Call on Lord…
Caged birds ain't singing anymore
They working to fit in hopes to satisfy the hoards
The cost of living In the land of free is steady climbing
We lost our focus on our sense “WE” when we rhyming
These days it’s all “I” and “Me” and other singulars
Self-talk on self-help bout life
And what’s the meaning of
All the shit we stress bout
The test and what we pressed bout
So focused on ourselves that those around us often left out
….If Mandela taught us nothing
It’s to love your fellow man
Or it’s all worth nothing

Chorus:
It's all about what your perspective is
It's all about what your objective is
Just take a moment to reflect on this
You'll realize it's all subjective kid (2x)
