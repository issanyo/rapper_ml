[verse 1: Via Rosa]

Lying here alone
Thinking about all the things
I wanna do to you
When we're alone
But the fear in my face
It makes you turn away
I think I'm pushing you away
N then you say

[hook: Via Rosa]
TELL ME SOMETHING REAL
TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME
N I PANIC
EVERY TIME
YOU SAY
TELL ME SOMETHING REAL
TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME
N I PANIC
EVERY TIME
YOU SAY

[verse 2: Via Rosa]
So i guess its just my que
To just walk away
I guess its better if i end this
Before it becomes something we can't save
We can't save this
But before i go
Before i go

[hook: Via Rosa]
TELL ME SOMETHING REAL
BEFORE I GO
TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME
IM NOT GONNA PANIC
IM NOT GONNA RUN AND HIDE THIS TIME
