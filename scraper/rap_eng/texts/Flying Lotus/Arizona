[Verse 1: Taxi]
Snap a ringpull you thirsty little motherfucks
No King fool, lucky to work in Star fucking bucks
Serving Mocha Lattes to mothers who do Pilates
Wonder about the future waking up in a new Bugatti
Then fail, blame illuminati, or the middle east
Out scheming in Abu Dhabi with Jews, Germans and Sheiks
Learn the number of the beast, gaze at lame conspiracies
Children under delirium, take no responsibility
That’s why Taxi is killing thee, attack them on the track
Then they can really see that what they rap is wack
And I'm not just chatting smack, feel the high and take a hit
Tryna make a hit, get rich, relax a lil bit
Spit facts, if my name not on the back then you shit
Anyone else is legit, unless i gave a skit
Imagine that I’m a crip, don’t show me no disrespect
May not own a tech but I’ll still come for your neck
So watch your fucking step, inbetween me and a check
I’ll rob your watch and chain you bought reading complex
Stop talking and use your brain, specifically cortex
Walking round and round in circles, you wondering who’s up next

[Verse 2: Ginseng Benji]
Me? Posted in a hooptie, selling kiddies pot brownies
Got start-shit itis so he took the whole army
Eyes droopy and the bag of cinnamon toast crunch is with him
Kush got us all stuck like a Jedi force grip (Uhh)
Excuse me, I’m rather bent while I spit these testaments
Reckless, Hyde-ing how Momma raised him Jekyll-ish
Rap seriously sober, but drunk spits like a drone
Sentences molotov cocktails, toss ‘em up and then walk home
(Yup) The 99 problems of these niggas
And bitches are all of mine, so hold up for a minute
Shaded from the leaves falling from the cherry blossom tree
Sip the green tea and leaves, just describing what I see
