[Intro]

Flex the product, steal the accolades
Never abdicate, statistics say he gonna spend half his life in, and out of halfways
Wanna live forever when he past paid
Butcher a Paige
Modelin' black bart dumpin in the cavalcade

[Verse 1]

States physically placid, but he's mentally erratic
Spazzin' till he's asthmatic, carpals rheumatic
Occupants seats still unfastened
Flabbergasted or problematic
Literacy above average
Famished flow satin, soundin a tad bit outlandish
Granted, sleep till them assets damaged

Flex the product steal the accolades, never abdicate.

[Verse 2]
Too advanced for the illiterate
Sentences is lucrative, grammar tad bit ludicrous
Do us through the pollen sniffed
Them fatten purses hurt again
Furnishin syphilis
Syllabus transitionin' to insolence
Curriculum vigilance, equivalence of testaments.
Murky when he spit, nod the head of the reverend
Paper come with mummification
Said, i'll see Satan for my sinnin'. But, whose killed more niggas than religion
Trying to figure out where it all fits in
Surely stackin' up the temperament
Inhaling loads of stimulants, see the world more vivid
Thorns breaking through the seems of cement
Rippin' ligaments from instruments
Packaging flaccid hits, the leviathan is back again

Flex the product steal the accolades, never abdicate

[Outro]
Rest in peace my nigga Jay.Forever engraved in our hearts, we love you my nigga
Parkside, next
