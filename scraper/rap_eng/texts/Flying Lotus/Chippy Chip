Break marijuana out baby roll that
Blow smoke rings to the temple with a soul clap
I love a soul clat
You already know that
I'm working unorthodox like Co Jack
Dylan Ross kick rhymes on the porch
And on my album
Even kicked a rhyme with torch
And on this I am kicking a gift ofcourse
And the summer pop will never stop running its course
Masturbator got rhymes for days now
With no days off so no time to lay down
I stay down with the same crew from the first second
It's volunteers 2010 I am representing
Romantic reclusive shit what I do still
Got me singing songs to a woman like Drew Hill
I'm too ill for the radio now
And I never be bouncing around like a radio clown
Well fuck em
So they put me in a box with a buncha guys rapping with fake ass Muslim names it sucks
Shabam Shabah Sabass Malik I'm talking
The gums you speak with no stuttering when they talking
Stupid American oxes and swine keep stuffing there faces and drinking boxes of wine
But if you know me you know that I flow sickly
But you only write fiction for pussies
Eric Jerome Dicky

Absolutely

Yeah I'm in I I am in Murk Mode
All week I've been in murk mode man
That's why I'm doing this
Took me two days to write this whole project
And it's gonna take you like two years to grasp what I'm doing
This..pretension
