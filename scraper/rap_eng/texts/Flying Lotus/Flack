Yo
All this hesitance is wasting time
All I'm trying to say is everyday the way I wanna make you mine
Taking my time developing everything I have
Cause I wanna give you everything
Even if I can't
I'm still not sure what the reason behind it is
I'm thinking about you even more than this rhyming biz
But if you want something that bad
It's gonna be in every single thought that you have
And I don't think you truly understand what I would do
Just to get the love of a beautiful woman like you
But I don't want you to be playing along
Cause that's pulling on my heart strings and playing a song like
"I'll never be satisfied until I see you up above me
I want to know what it would take to make you say you love me"

And I'm out
I'm done
Peace
I love you
