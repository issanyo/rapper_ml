[Verse 1]
I want to go right, I'm safe on my block
Except for the cops
Will they attack?
Would it be 'cause I'm black?
I want to fly away off into space and into the sun
With all those spirits and space dust and aliens
Where we belong (fuck yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Although it seems like it's all crashing down
I just want to ride my bike
Through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
Miss me with that nonsense
I'm free as a bird (free)
And light as the wind
Just leave me alone (easy)
Just let me ride off into space (space ride)
That's where I want to be (space ride)
