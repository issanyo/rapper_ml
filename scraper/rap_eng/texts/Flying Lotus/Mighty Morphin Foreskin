[Verse 1]
Guess who's finna get weird
Finna get sinisterly, definitely feared
Working in these surf
[?] all we live since we
Black love marmalade, I got slobbing
New yellow accomplice common it's nonprofit
Top shelf, carve if they novice, or to god
The cardiac pardon departures like, how they mad?
Keep making niggas, tripping at the artifact
Precious beats, that speaks rest to the lake city
Can't just watch me, I know Naki
Dead missiles in the crystal grid
Indentations deep, bathing inconsistently
Raiding inconsistently, evade it
Don't mention it, the convention
Express, just set the intention
Our vengeance stay comprehensive, alive
In control, invincible, individual, we're part of hole
Wild out in a fort please stop, can I be stoned?
So, shut the fuck up
Y'all just chill and I'll propose the omen, It's okay, ay
Cause me and my ninjas are stripping all night
Done spent all day, just raping in new beats
Thinking about the moment I can travel your streets
Savage man return of the said sad sack
From the laughing grills, Imagine that
Yeah, I'm mad, where the cash at?
Ride on past that pazazz
Spazz on a fast track and then crash
Know it don't matter, at all, so at ease
Universal chatter, wax on it's that easy, peasy
Sit em' on the ground, see the mother town
Yeah man, it's about some of that "uhh"
I'm a lover loud, sinners of a light
Light up the world, fuck being precious
Sheesh, that's so feces
We operate on Jesus and peace
Girl, well indeed it is
Zeroh, one!
Please
