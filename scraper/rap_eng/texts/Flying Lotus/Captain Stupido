[Chorus]
I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I think I left my wallet at the club
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Jesus, take the wheel

[Chorus]
I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I think I left my wallet at the club
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Jesus, take the wheel

[Chorus]
I feel weird
Comb your beard, brush your teeth
Still feel weird
Beat your meat, go to sleep

[Outro]
I think I left my wallet at the club
