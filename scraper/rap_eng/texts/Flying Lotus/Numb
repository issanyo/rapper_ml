[verse]
We built a foundation, so I made a wish
That the radio would play our ish
Fingers crossed like a gangsta twist
But they didn't so I'm aetheist
Now I make the shit i wanna make, Without catering
I gotta thank the WIZ
So, Draw up a note
Payola woulda colored me broke
Like crayola tips
Thank you miss
Cause if i crossed over, i would make your ankles rip for a taste of this
I'm fresher than an angel clit
7 lakes of spit, I'm not radio captive
I'm radio active
Successfully sitting inside
The same imagination that I've had here since I was five
And I'll gladly share it witchya
If you wanna hear it
Getchya
Headphones
I'm coloring my corner of the earth
I just wanna make it pretty for you
Something you can smile on between school, kids, stress and goin to work
Now
This is when the bus comes
And I hop on, close my eyes and wait for someone
To tell me it's a dream, yep, this is all a dream
Those paintings sittin' in your head at night that make you wanna scream
Make you wanna sing
That's the real thing
That's the real thing
That's the closest you will ever get to feel-ing
That's a feel-ing
That's not the floor babe
We're on the ciel-ing
Numb to the world
Eyes closed
Dreams are the new new world
I chose

[hook]
Numb to the world
Eyes closed
Dreams are the new new world
I chose
Numb to the world
Eyes Closed
These are my new new wings
Fly Low
Fly High
Fly High
Fly High
Sky High
Sky High
Sky High

Synesthesia
