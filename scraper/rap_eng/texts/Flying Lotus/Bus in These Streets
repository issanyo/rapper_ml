[Verse 1]
Stuck in the clouds
That’s my story and I’m sticking to it
I'm high as a kite
Don’t bother me
I’m out here probably doing the most

[Verse 2]
From the minute I wake up I’m staring at the screen
Watching the world go insane
Gotta stay connected so I know what's happening
In these streets
Thank God for technology ‘cause where would we be if we couldn’t tweet our thoughts?
Won’t you leave some things to mystery?
Opening your mouth removes all doubt
So be quiet
Technology is the key to it all

[Verse 3]
Where did I lose my phone at?
Doesn’t really matter because you’re already behind the curve
It’s okay to disconnect sometimes
We’re out here doing the most
