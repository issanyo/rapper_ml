[Verse 1: Symone]
Flying through time
Caught up with the sound
Colors flashing on both sides
Peace came walking down

[Chorus: Symone]
You remember when
We all launched into space as friends
All united, but minds yet divided
Yes we lead
With the thought of equality
Never surrender
He is our defender
Staying strong
Keep the faith as we're pressing on
Looking to the sky
Thinking all through the night
Thinking all through the night

[Verse 2: Symone]
Crawling past strobes
Laying on the beat
Greens blues and yellows
Smash along my face
Hues came to help me
Dancing in the dark on the hottest night
Watching the fireflies shine bright
We glowed the shade that beat in our hearts
Playing our part
Leaders we are

[Chorus: Symone]

[Verse 3: cAb and Black Genesis]
Yeah
And the world that we live in
Is  kind of like a prism
Cause all the colors in it
Ugh
I need to make a pivot
Make some better decisions
Lord knows I'm on a mission
Ugh
And the winnings we can split it
You my nigga don't forget it
Stick together 'til the endin'
Yeah they say I be muggin'
I just shrug don't give a fuck
Can turn nothing to somethin'
In a second standing tall in my section
All my niggas stay protectin'
They got my back just relax
You can bet the nine spit
If them niggas act
These niggas acting hard
But I see through it
Like special glasses with poker cards
X-ray vision
One day here but the next day missin'
Fishing for a reason and a dollar
Partner you ain't got it you could holla'
