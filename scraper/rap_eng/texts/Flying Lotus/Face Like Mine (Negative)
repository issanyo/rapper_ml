Don't u just hate a face like mine
A little bit a me wishes that I was lying

Born round the time of hitting that pipe
Climbed out the gutter, just a brutha with a slice
Why live my life like I like my music
Might be bout to die,
ain't got no time for loopin

Held on
to a file of Superfly for 12 years
Willed with the blood of which
My grinds won't get near

But still, Im goin hard as the tough
Ass with the crutch wishes ill pass him my lunch
They miserable, unoriginal
Limit literal, don't gimme small
I want a little more n a little more

See them get to
looking low whenever my head is up
Sad, how I look like a happy black with better luck

I wanna make em sad,
in a way only a man can
Relaxed in a warzone, its all suicide
With you aside,
we all movin like we madmen
Relaxed in a warzone, its all suicide

Negative,
checking people out just to take their tricks
No entity
with a greater reach than us
to fix the way we live

What's the point in rapping if you ain't saying shit
Acre cribs, weight pulling, change ya wig, Paperclips

Why they Only like to see me when they on top
Only wanna think i'm hot when i got a spot
Only wanna pay attention to my mouth
When its on a rot
Only wanna say i'm being real, when i'm on the block

Don't know anything
nor anyone for real
The one who needs help
Is the one who's gon get killed

U can't cut me or take shots
Cos I ain't on the scene..
I hate them cos they hate me
They hate me because of who i am and what i mean

Like with the music that's sadly
just not enough
How am i made to hate to look at what I love


Unused: (for singing)
Your sad when you see me on your street
Happy when you see me up to no good
Proud when you see me wearing shit cheap
Don't wanna get noticed by me

A face like mine. You'd be better off without
Just from one look you can know what I'm all about
And all the words that come falling out my mouth
Become a weirdos words, fuck what they were about

On purpose, i forget that my memory is shit
I failed at tryna be a good mentor I dipped
Left the unders up to numbers cos my 1 weren't for none's spot
Now two doing 50, and another got his lung popped

That's life. Can't always get what u want
