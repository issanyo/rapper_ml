[Bridge: Jack Davey]
Four stars, fancy bars, tours and the award shows
Can’t forget the Warhols
I want it all!
Anything you want from me
I will do
Yea, anything you want in life
I will find you

[Verse 1: Blu]
Aye, he said he want the mansion and a yacht and that Porsche drop top
Wanna be a big timer, get that Boucheron watch
I’m tryna pop bottle tops in New York's top clubbin with the top dropped, (?) are not hot
Something tell my woman (?) jumpin like it’s hopscotch
Wanna get blunted, and I’m getting blunted non-stop
Bro I want that top spot, or a comfy loft, just as how I want
Money gloss, print money, clip initials, I (?)

[Chorus: Jack Davey]
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK

[Bridge]
Four stars, candy bars, tours and the award shows
Can’t forget the Warhols
I want it all!
Anything you want from me
I will do

[Verse 2: Blu]
Noise city went to downtown, lofts and them parties on the boat
Want that ’87 Caddy with them gold hundred spokes on
All my hundred notes with the small face, Benny Franks
Send a private tester just to tell me how that Henny taste
One on each arm when I step in any place
And every time I travel by air I want an empty plane
Yea, empty plane every time I travel
When she had the nerve to tell me don’t trip it’s all handled like

[Chorus]
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK

[Break: Jack Davey]
Love is (I really wanna know)
Love is (I really wanna know)

[Bridge]
Anything you want from me
I will do

[Verse 3: Blu]
When the car was in the impound, cell phone was off yo
So rest already (?), you’re playin (?)
Mind was on another planet, asks me what it cost
Speakin what a fuckin waste if I kept it just to floss
Country’s little (?), money ain’t real yo
Lavish life is pretty, wonder how that make you real yo
Average life is shitty, wonder how to make a million man
That car is kinda spiffy, let me sit behind the wheel
I’m tryna feel it like

[Chorus]
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK
Everything is OK
Everything is OK
Everything is OK
Everything’s OK

I want it all!
