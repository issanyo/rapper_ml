[Intro: Sample & Neako]
The wildest ones, the untamed
Forgotten ones, the unfammed
From the bottom, they need to change
Seperated, but who’s to blame
Everyday they’re earning stripes
Without wings, no fear of flight
In the darkness seeing light
Send for us when you need advice
All together, running fast
Never stopping, built to last
Leaving troubles, in the past
LVLerica, here at last
All of you come go with us
Levitate, blow smoke with us
Regulate, go ghost with us
Zebra Gang, in the world we trust
Yeah

[Verse 1: Neako]
Hella smoke in my circle, hella trees in my jungle
And if you ain’t LVLYSL or Taylor Gang then fuck you
Money came and I made it out
Tell my mama I love you
Ya husband died, but I’m right here
I put nothin’ else above you, I do all of this because you
Give me joy when I hug you
Now you chillin’ in a fly ass crib, they can’t take nothin’ else from you
Top floor, top floor, yeah they holdin’ that spot for
A real nigga, real nigga
You talkin’ swag? Then I got more
Nigga’s mad ‘cause I shot call
Where I go, they not involved
More money but no problems solve
They wonder what I keep fightin’ for
Inside my life, come along, I invite you all
Walkin’ on a line, a tight one
And you might [?] fall
My points up
I’ll meet you all at the final four
I’m handlin’ bis’, no plans on mindin’ y’all

[Intro: Neako]
Yeah, as we go
Yeah, as we go
As we go
Yeah, as we go
Yeah, yeah as we go
Yeah, as we go
