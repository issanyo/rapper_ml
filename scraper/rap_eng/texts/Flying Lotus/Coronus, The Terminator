[Verse 1]
Don't come back
Cause I might just save you
Baby don't come back
Cause I might just save you
The days of men are coming to an end
So come with me, if you wanna live
You come from a time where they look the same
And think the same too
There's nowhere left to go, so I might just save you
They all want to be saved
My hands been bloody since the day I came
It's such a shame, you've seen my violent side
So baby don't come back
Cause I might just kill you
