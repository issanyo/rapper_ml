[Verse 1: Vonnie Cardigans]

Sweet synonyms, kitchen is black cinnamon
Salty ni*ggas that sinning and spitting these black sentences
Send these ni*ggas back to the back like Sega Genesis
After the fact of the prepositional menaces
Under your door lurking like 2nd Ember, the Arsonist
Coughing up Arsenic, element of your politics
Talking triangles, these ni*ggas ruling your parliaments
Little parasites with these pair of eyes watching all of you
Finnin' to, take out my di*ck so I'm F*cking all of them
Little poetic rapper, he flowing like an artisan
Posted at the beacons of hell to paint all the arts of sin
Young aithiest into Heaven, breaking them carcusses
Grab a sword, have a sword fight with Hitler's officers
Offer the, spot to the niggas in part of Tarturus
Have a first fight with the George Washington followers
Watch him fall again and I'm prominent so they faultering
Assasinate Lincoln and blame it on sea walruses
I'm from the deep sea but them nig*gas on the (fa)- surfaces
3rd eye deeper than
Scoffing at all conservatives who put a bit of poison
In that food before they serve a dish

[Hook: Vonnie Cardigans]

Consider me a GOD bi*tch
Even though I'm just another (little) stupid myth || (x3)

[Verse 2: Vonnie Cardigans]

Stupid afomism, as*ses catch him after dinner
Bumping Earl Sweatshirt, MF DOOM with a tad a vemon
Me Duane Frazier in back drinking Dr.Pepper like
Tyler Landell got smacked for providing pressure
Little nigg*as come up spitting like the birdy essence
Try to test him, with the extra sh*t, dirty estrogen
Tell these organisms organ playing from an octopus
Octi-pot and get it, high as monsters that be stalking us
Ripping corn stalks, I know its corny because I talk alot
Star in the fu*ckin space, thought I was an astronaut
Chilling with Repunzel and I'm story in "Ass-Alot"
Crashing cars, burning all the trucks into the parking lot
Swisher said its quicker than a ni*ga trying park a spot
Fresh of the Leonards talking learning like he Amistad
Early on the molitov pissing all of the teachers off
I'm writing poetry, they can't understand where my meaning falls
I'm too complex for these ni*ggas
To, know the meaning, my own generation so stupid
They killing all of us
Looking bleak, turning hazardous

[Ending Hook: Vonnie Cardigans]

Consider me a GOD bi*tch
Even though I'm just another little stupid myth...
Consider me a GOD bi*tch
