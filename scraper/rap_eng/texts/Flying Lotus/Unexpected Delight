Made a connection on a connecting flight
A window seat had unexpected delight

Business turned pleasure with a chance meeting
Our encounter was epic but fleeting

A lifetime together in one night's rendez-vous
We swore to keep in touch but didn't follow through

I often wonder what could have been
In another what, where and when
