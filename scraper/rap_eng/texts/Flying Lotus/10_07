[Intro]
Welcome to take flight, people!
Been a while
Aye yo Kayo, think they ready man?
I think so too, uh

[Verse]
Came in the rap game like I'm trying to get it pregnant
Time to put this motherfucker under wraps like a present/
Emperor in this bitch, y'all little niggas peasants
Might talk a lot of shit but I'm thankful for my blessings/
Spent spring and part of the summer writing rhymes
Had to hurry up and drop this I felt like I was wasting time/
Still dedicated, still striving to be the greatest
Still driving to the point where I say "Cleveland we made it"/
A thousand plus views on both mixtapes
Not bad for my first year but I'm trying to raise the stakes/
Ain't being taken serious and I ain't having that
I'ma get respect for the shit I'm kicking in these raps/
To most people I'm nameless
By the end of this year I'm going to be on some of y'all some of y'all playlists/
Feeling like it's meant to be ain't no need to slack off
Trying to turn this from a hobby to a day job/
Last year was a test this year I'm hungry
Coming for the crown like that motherfucker owe me money/
I ain't underground, I'm under the underground
I unleashed the beast time to shut this motherfucking game down, nigga/
Take over on these clown niggas
Fuck around and be the talk of the town, nigga/
A MC in the fucking building
Would've said rapper but that's not really fulfilling/
Putting action in my music
Cause just talking about it is making my actions useless/
DOPE Coalitia still the team, better yet the navy
We ready for the game no if, and's, buts, or maybe's/
It's all about the game on some Triple H shit
Got rappers on tombstones cause I'm undertaking shit/
Fuck being timid I'm going past my potential
Killing so called competition I'm taking my credentials/
Ill ass nigga they should put me in a quarantine
Contracted with this illness since I was 14/
Raps automatic like Ray Allen's threes
Running shit like I'm in a track meet/
Word to Minute Maid I got the juice
Call a sneaker asylum I'm crazy with shoes/
Style too official not much can fuck with me
Whether said or not I'm one of the flyest in my city/
Niggas talk money, I instantly laugh
While they blowing theirs I'm watching mine stack/
The standout in Cleveland case I didn't tell y'all before
Eating all these rappers y'all should call me a rapivore/
I want the legacy y'all can have all the riches
While I'm working on mine y'all on twitter whining like bithces/
More work and less complaining
That's all a nigga saying
Things that coming with the game I'm ready to face it/
Lifting the game it's all in the muscle
Might not like me but you still respect this motherfucking hustle, nigga/
Now that's real talk, can't sugarcoat it
I'm sticking to the script, ain't trying to lose my motive/
Big up Flying Lotus, you nice on the beats
10/07 difference is he's '83 I'm '93, uh/
