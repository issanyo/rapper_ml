[Chorus]
3 o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me

3 o'clock, just can't close my eyes
Something's wrong with me
No, I can't deal, I can't go to sleep
There's something in my heart
The streets keep calling me
