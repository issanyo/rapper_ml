Ninety Four

Blanks (verse)

Mind trippy abstract
Ash that then pass that
Hash sack built to blow off ya snapback
Flashback
To reality
Floatin
Fuck gravity
Anoter fatality
Actually
I been dead
For about 4 years
I doubt more tears
Will appear from these fears
I stand alone with no pears
You fearing that end is near
Im prayin that the end is here
Cause everynight I lay restless
I got a dutch ill flex this
Reclkless
I dont think you know what respect is
Check this
I been a threat
But I dont think they get it yet
Reserect
Dont disrespect
Or interject the intelect
Its pricless
Livin lifeless
In this crisis
The nicest
Rollin up the most potent spices
Just to keep me rational
Work my mind tactical
Actual
Factual
Livin so casual
Fuck that anxiety
Get a dutch at jets variety
I am swear I am to high to see the people waving hi to me
Or bye to me
Im too zoned
Feelin like the sky is my new home
And theres no traffic in the airway
They say to fight the fair way
But I ain't livin their way
Walkin up this stairway
So open up the gates
Take a hit of the L just to see how it tastes
Kinda like some sour grapes
Can't pull me down man im too high
New guy
I see you tellin more then a few lies
Those blue eyes
Contradict my thoughts like true lies
You flew by
No hesitation
Fuckin up my respiration
Now your under investigation
Finna find out what life means
While rollin up this light green
I see heavens light beams
I hope I have the right skeems
I said I hope I have the right skeems
Cause I need to take that leap
Which is why I fear sleep
Cause countin guap doesnt come from countin sheep
Im in too deep
Down this creek without a paddle
So I battle to rattle theres minds without a snake
As I shadow these cattle eatin good ill have steak
As I make lectures
Watch me brake records
This shit takes effort

So dont act like im not workin
Where im goin? im not certain
Drivin by the cop swervin
Observin life as a person
Who never really had much
Shit that piss me off?
When I get a bad dutch
Ill still skill cause I be rollin like tire
Fill it up fire
Labeld as a pyromaniac
Pinky & the brain
Obviiously I am the braniac
This worlds under takover
I know you smell that bake oder
Ain't sober
Im cheeifin keef
Its funny how im dreamin
I dont even sleep

Its funny how im dreamin
I dont even sleep (x3)
