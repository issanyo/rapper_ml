Every joint goes hard, so I need a massage
Y’all been staring at the picture, couldn’t see the collage
Even though I bring the heat, I’d never lead a mirage
It’s all real; see most of y’all need a facade
And your bars aren’t wack, they’re simply fine
Just another clone from off of the assembly line
I’ve seen it all, the rise, peak then the decline
It’s cool for some, but that path wasn’t meant to be mine
Yeah the prince’ll pull the plug on elementary rhymes
Pay attention in detention, get your mental  refined
Instead of tryna cut, like you dropped a weight class
Maybe get some straight A’s instead of dropping straight ass
And if you think you bout to get saved by  the bell
You go out like D’Angelo Barksdale in his cell
Gotta show these Ol wack hacks how to mold tracks
So Mr.Alford, don’t be afraid to hold back
