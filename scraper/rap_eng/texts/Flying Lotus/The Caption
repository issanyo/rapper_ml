[Verse 1]
First Friday of the school year
Fresh view but I ain't even new here
It's been some 5 years since I kicked it in the Burg for the summer
Dream chasing yeah rap was my lover
And its still is, first best friend was a steel kid
Had my back even when I couldn't feel shit
20 questions my identity's necessity
Like do I fit where the weird lives um
Mr. mirror man on the wall who's the realest of em all cause
I done had my doubts and seconds about this uh
Particular choice of a career but now I think I figured it out
I'm on my own island how Staten is
You brits want war my lyrics bust back at ya like I'm packing it
Adamant and fashionably late to every party
Head held high chest up Dolly Parton
Take my mans try to break my clan
And we'll jack your chains like jakes do chans
Y'all sweet rhymes tacky I'm saltwater taffy
Tough to deal with like a permanent tan
Now let me ask did you get those lines
Or should I slow it down since you can keep up
New good will hunter ahead of my time
Recycling rhymes and you'll get sweeped up
But um..

[Hook]
I don't stress over nothing
I'm way too cool for that and
This could be my only life but
I'll still be cool with that
Its like, ooh- damn-
DJ turn it up you know this my jam
Cause like, ooh- damn-
And I'mma party my ass off while I can

[Verse 2]
My inquiries of infamy living for infinity
96 kid killing shit in your vicinity
No room for them breezies who be dissing me
Peace to the negative rhymes so Divinity
Shoutout to my cuzzo yeah love what I must show
Beat bounce like the bus riding over bumps doe
Shred til I'm tired Lou Inferno forever
Still my flow cold Pittsburgh winter weather
Hoes coming clean don't forget to take a shower
Fools bluffing saying they gon put me under flowers
You lying like a bitch crying like a bitch
Kill you on your knees yeah you dying like a bitch
Sorry for the cursing in my verses
But in the end Ma I swear its all worth it
I'm finna put these posers in hearses
Centaur so you know my aim perfect
What up
