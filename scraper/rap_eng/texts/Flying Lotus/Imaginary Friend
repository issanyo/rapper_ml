Verbal war tactics, have you galloping to madre
Imagining what I say, madness is macabre
You out of place kid, I gamble 5K
Shake hands, step toes, good game and have a nice day
Book you in the face, I will end you like MySpace
You looking like the squirrel chasing acorns in Ice Age
Indecisive seats, excited about Friday
In the front? In the back? Please make up your mind state
Hi, hey, goodbye, you only stand a foot high
Instead of asking "would I?", you ask yourself "should I?"
Looseleaf, rip a sheet, serve them like sushi
Noobies be bitching B, more drama than Kabuki
Woo-wee, won't speak any of that to me
I see it in tweet form and all up in my newsfeed
And truly, I am calm and collected
But piss me off and I will bomb your defenses

All the offenses, I put them on the frontline
Compared to Captain Falcon when I work on all these punchlines
One time, but I'll say it again
This is all real, I'm not playing pretend

So call up your imaginary friends
I'll calculate the chemistry through binary trends
And we can spend the whole day discussing our thoughts
Like does Father Time really love us or not?
And how come the world is never concerning us?
And why is Mother Nature refusing to nurture us?
I don't grow, I don't age
I don't know where to stay
In this life, I guess I'll be forever watching Teletubbies
Storing Dr. Seuss storybooks in my smelly cubby
Overalls, farmer clothes, childish karate blows
Sticking to Atari flows, living Super Mario
Fire flower over Ford truck tire power
Countdown to New Year's, I hope I can minus hours
Without falling asleep, leave your call at the beep
While you're chilling in winter, I'm still in autumn this week
