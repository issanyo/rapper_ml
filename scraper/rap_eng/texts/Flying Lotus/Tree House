[Verse 1]
I try too hard
But why am I on one
And so we just live
And time might be nothing
But if I exist

[Bridge]
I should probably just learn
Don't know if I concern
Don't understand any problems
I know I think I'm on all

[Verse 2]
But if I
Could find myself again
Find my self again (Again)
I would like to tell me

[Outro]
Its been
Its been like this ever since
