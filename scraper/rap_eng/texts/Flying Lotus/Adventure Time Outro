[Produced by Flying Lotus]
Come along with me
To a town beside the sea
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Come along with me
To a cliff under a tree
Where we'll gaze upon the water
As an everlasting dream
All of my affections
I'll give them all to you
Maybe by next summer
We won't have changed our tune
'Cause we'll want to be
In this town beside the sea
Making up new numbers
And living so merrily
All of my affections
Give them all to you
I'll be here for you always
And always be for you
Come along with me
To a town beside the sea
We can wander through the forest
And do so as we please
Living so merrily
