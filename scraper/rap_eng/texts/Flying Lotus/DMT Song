[Verse 1]
I can take you to a world
Where you can spread your wings and fly away
Patterned grid world, it waits where you
And it have always been there from the start

[Hook]
Maybe you and me are not so different (different)
Maybe I will see your world in full, DMT (DMT)

[Verse 2]
As I'm dreaming, wide awake
My body never leaves the floor
I never, want to come back
I belong where I am at
