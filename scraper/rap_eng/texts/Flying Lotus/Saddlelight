[Verse 1: Zeroh]
Baby as soon as I get rid of this T-shirt
I'm gonna put you under my spell
Sensational incantations pacing aching to be inside of the chasm
I'm having a moment
Orgasm from the back, spasm crawling up my spine
Cussin' and grind our spirits combine your mind
I really wanted this, I really needed this
Then came out of my shell like I chucked my Adidas
I don't mean to sound elitist, but I deserve the best
Y'all can have the rest
Heavy breath legs wrapped around me
Dreads up on her chest, she told me I was blessed
I told her we were God she said nigga you's a mess
Put her hands up on her lips now we fogging up the office
Play the boss like Michael Scott
For 28/11 7:47 on her watch she hollered out
Now blqbird done hit that spot

[Hook]
I'm a saddle light, get it right
I don't care if it's tight
I'm just like, "sit up on my saddle light"
Then get it right, get it right, try not to get it wrong my nigga
They want to see me on my saddle light
I don't care if it's tight
I'm just like, "sit up on my saddle light"
Then get it right, get it right
Get it right, get it right
I'm just like, "sit up on my saddle light then get it right, get it right"
Alright I'm done fooling around with this shit

[Verse 2]
If you consider peace and love as a fashion
Fasten your average ass to the back of the cabin
I'm taking you up, don't know what the fuck you'd up and done
You suffered the fun of it
Living moment to moment honing it, holding it
Boning, moaning and groaning, I'm someone to see
They growing for sure show 'em the whole orbit
Is in my order I hope out of focus
And go for the dopest open door
Swinging my chain, I put that on my 25th beat
Zeroh 'bout to give you what you needed
Once your ego was defeated by the greediest
Indeedy I defeated all the heebie-jeebiesâ€‹
Feeding off your heart, feeding off the heart
Don't worry about the niggas just play your part
Hard head, these girls are smart
[Fart noise] excuse me my tongue just farted
Yeah, I'm kind of silly, okay we can snuggle and cuddle
It's, getting kind of chilly
Ain't it a wonderful thing when two human beings
Can just vibe and hang and say whatever the fuck they feel
Without all that bullshit
Yeah I know you always wondered where the dream nigga must stowing in
I'm sorry it took me so long to remind you that
What you were really waiting for was me
Here I am
