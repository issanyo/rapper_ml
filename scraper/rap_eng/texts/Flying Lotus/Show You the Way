[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Interlude: Thundercat]
It's your boy; Thundercat

[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Heavy-hearted, but my burden's light
I just wanna live, and learn how to fly
When it's all over, breathe into the light
Sink or swim, I'm not scared to die

[Interlude: Thundercat]
Tell 'em how you feel, Kenny
Kenny Loggins

[Verse 2: Kenny Loggins]
Your heart is struggling, baby
Trying to believe
That there might be something you just couldn't see
But what if I told you babe
It’s all so easy

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning light, on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Interlude: Thundercat]
Ladies and gentlemen; Michael McDonald

[Verse 3: Michael McDonald]
Wake up and dream, tear down the wall
Of all you believe that might not be true
Long as love lies waiting there
Just hold your face into the light
Though right now you might not know why
Long as love lies waiting
They ain’t know our way, baby

[Chorus: Thundercat]
Let me show you, show you the way
On the edge of dark there's the brightest light
A burning one, on the edge of dark
Where no-one can tell they’re worlds apart
We'll live with dark, just take the ride

[Outro: Thundercat]
Hey, how's it going? This is your boy, Thundercat. If you're going to fill your water bottle with vodka, always make sure you have a friend with a bottle that actually has water in it
