[Verse 1: Kuro Silence]
Where to go?
I feel like I feel my soul
So tell me why I don't know about my surroundings
Though I've seen them all once before
The same just not at my door
And now that the future's knocking
I'm falling down like the floor
Is coming from under me
I'm being dragged undersea and
I don't know how to swim and water I cannot breathe
So tell me if I am dying (x4)
Uhh
The master blaster complex is massive
I don't run bartertown
So why you asking?
I'm just a citizen trying to live
In fact it's impossible cause of police tactics
Versus the street where heads
Are getting cracked and
Days just fade to black
The nights darker than black
And man I'm so stressed
And damn I ain't blessed and
I don't know if I'll make it to heaven
The thought violence moves
Inside of my head

[Verse 2]
Telling me take the easy way out
And make some cash
Run up and jump some folks take their wallets and dash
Unemployment is rampant and I just want me some scratch contemplated phoning a dealertell him front a pack, but I know that ain't me so I put the phone back go back into my mental look for another path
Knowing I'm just a Kid
Trying to make it to higher class knowing my day to day is my inspiration to rap
Know I want to be rich to repay my mom and dad aware that I took so damn much and ain't give back
How can I truly say that I love living like that?
Tell me how I alleviate pain acting like this
Tell me how I can get you to listen if you hear this knowing if I don't make it then I'mma be so remiss

Aware that death is common and I exist in a war

Noticed that death is coming it's all matter of time

Matter of time is fading and falling quick as the blind

Another child hiding hoping behind blinds

That their safety's assured fearful of sound minds

Mortars and land mines but the real object is time

Out of control
Ignorant of a soul
Detriment to us all
Puzzling jigsaw
Desire to kill us all
Swaying from wall to wall
Drunken stupor and all
Lying within it's wake
Will find that power takes
Much more than it gives
Saying don't live in sin
Then commit sins
Causing eradication debating on whether or not I'm satan appetites so unsated while trying to kill us and hatred violent in it's nature straying minds from humanity rather live in insanity focus is simple vanity wonder if that could stand to me
