Verse: cynicism inside of me cause I'm so courageous,👹
The optimism inside assist my meditation, 👽
THC & DMT my medication, 🚬✴
On aviating the elevations of creation existing see, ✳
Singularity lets me repeat history, 📆
To paint the picture to tell the story of humanity, 👪
The Death Angel Of Alchemy, 👼
The Master of Symbology analogy,❄
It seems the universe is fake,🌌
Outside of my mind it seem to simulate, 🌏
Abandoned my pride I recognize my fate,🎭
As I attempt to bound myself in enlightened thoughts,✨
& Open up these kingdom hearts in these locked vaults, 🔐♥
Recognized out the soul now, 👽
Walk the path of these dark trials
Us Souls Eaters in control now, 👼
Us Crystal Gems in control now,💎
Let go of materials now,🌠
I'm a Capricorn a old soul in the physical gotta slow down,♑
This Universal fabrication,🔮
Reject infatuation
As I inject the information, 📖
Falling logic infiltration, 📜
From alpha to omega my manifestation
Chakura reactivation
I retain my zen patience,🎎
Ain't no fearing humans round here build a pyramid 'fore I'm gone, 🔺
But i won't hold on to no fear i got Nirvana state in my soul, 🔵
This That infinite beyond life,✴
That existence beyond might, 🌌
That Continuation insinuating the paradigm as we live & die (lets go!!!) 🌏

(Break)
(Bridge:)
Oh why oh why oh why
Am I so high,🌃
Oh why oh why oh why

(Chorus:)
My ego never ever catch me now 👼
My heroes  never ever let me down (x2)👑👼👽👤
My ego will never ever catch me (x2)

(❄Iceee!❄)
... My ego will never ever catch...
Oh why oh why oh why!
(Beat transition)
(End)
