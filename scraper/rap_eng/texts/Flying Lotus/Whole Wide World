Se loire, Loire se amor, amor se si da

Se loi-

[Intro: Declaime]
I never act [?] too much
Hardly put my self first
Now its time to quench this thirst
Worlds got bad and its only getting worse
Like we've all been cursed cursed

Even the rich got problems
Not even they churches can solve them
So we hide behind our fake face souls
Not the faces take place
Don't trip, tie up your shoelace
And keep on steppin'
Cos I'm gon keep on, reppin' compassion

And yall keep askin' why
History 'till the day that I die
I love yall till the moment I fly
A baptist priest of flesh and bone
I'm on my way back home

Back to the source
The light side of the force
Holdin' that torch and I'm lingering and hot
If yall with me then lets ride
If not it'll be your suicide side side

[Chorus: Declaime & Flying Lotus]
I want the world world world
I want the whole wide world world world
I want the world world world world
Give me the world world world
Give me the whole wide world world world
I want the world world world yeah

[Bridge: Flying Lotus]
Yeah, life's a dream and times a drunken dance
The moonlight laughin' and the sun with you
And at times the rain will fall on fall on down
The essence of God is divine almighty
The realist way for all one loves
There could be a full promotion in humanity

[Verse 1: Declaime]
Yall think I'm playin'
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin'?
Yall think it helps my plan, huh
Man, yall better do more than that
Cos you could go out at the drop of a hat
Or do we go out like that that that that chat
Fell into a knife trap
It's a rap D.R.E
Devil set these shows free
Come down on me
Come test this challenge

This warrior of light huh
In the still of the night
I know what I'm doin' is right
My homies say I need to change what I write
Stop talkin' bout light yeah right man

And yall call me crazy huh
But imma go on until the lights on, yall think not
I see yall did wrong, cos life is how you make it
And death is where you take it take it
And after that yall can no longer fake it
So be real real

[Chorus: Declaime]
I want the whole wide world world world world
Give me the world world world
Give me the whole wide world world world
I want the world world world world
I want the world
I want the whole wide world world world
I want the world world world world

[Verse 2: Declaime]
Inter-planetary peace talk
Lord pass the weak
And I am your captain of this ship, this mothership
Cos this is some other shit
And my co-pilot for the evening
Better yet, until he twenty

[Chorus: Declaime]
But yall know know
I want the world world world
I want the whole wide world world world
Give me the world world world yeah
Give me the world world world
I want the whole wide world world world
I want the world world world yeah

I want the world world world World
