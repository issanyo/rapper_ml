I know I'll see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your love and your light
Though we say goodbye
We will say hello again
You'll always live in our hearts and our minds
Thank you for being a friend
That you were to me
I cherish the moments of all our good time
You traveled beyond
Your legacy lives on
Go forward as the eagle
To your endless planets

I know I will see you again
In another life
Thank you for sharing your light with the world
Travel beyond
Your legacy lives on
Now enter the void
Forever, the Jondy
