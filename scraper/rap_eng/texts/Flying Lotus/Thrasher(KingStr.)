Mama shocked man, she must cry
Lost my faith when Naked Snake lost his left eye
I mean his right one
Nice for you to write one, or two song
Instead of wasting time on that futon
Spitting like my tooth gone, or lose when I'm in the booth
And Me, my niggahs rolling triple 5, and you can add a 3
And all the addicts scratching ass and getting mad at me
Cause what I spit is similar to dmt and acid sheets
Where them white girls at I got something to feed 'em
A couple pills, a life of thrill, and a face full of semen
Gnarly, when they see them thrasher hoodies and decks on the cement
Leadin' all the non believers to places the wouldn't be in
Before they stick they hands out man, I'm trynna leave 'em
So its high fives, hugs and kisses and I left them cheesin'
Over to gilroys , causing all the ruckus
Know the staff hate us, but them drunk bitches wanna fuck us
Please
Half past broke, still looking like a bunch of cheese
Wear so much bape, I can probably speak japanese
Or them subbed animes will teach us
Embrace imagination and middle fingers to teachers
Said that I would make it and niggahs didn't believe us
Now we got a point to prove, and my daughter gon' have to eat up
Or Skateboard Deryll's daughter
I mean I'm not the father
But that's my family so I'm gonna need a couple commas
Take a bleezy to the face, I call it blunt trauma
Spitting bars so hot, you probably think I wrote them in a sauna
This is why I'm hot like MIMS
Cause I only fuck with tens, and Im never following trends
Only speak with currency like Roddy, Freddie Gibbs, or Trademark
You wanna talk then my niggah that's gon' depend
I'm kinda drunk so I stumble inside the crib
Looking mommy in the face and pray she's forgiving my sins like..
