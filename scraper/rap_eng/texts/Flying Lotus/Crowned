[Verse 1]
This the kind of night that feel perfect for some mischief
The spliff I lit reveals my worst intentions
They watch the wheels of the cab chase the shadows from the sunset
I'm mad I let these dumb thoughts manifest to regrets
And stain sweat, sticky fingers, bad dreams
Garlic breath, itchy feet, smelly farts and pickle cream
The night is nothing like it seems
I've been around the corner until I make a cat scream
Leaning out the window let the rain touch
Sweaty palms on the steering wheel when I hit the clutch
Hit trees, then hit tree, why not full speed?
Blood stained material with the rear-view memories
Let a few shots, light the sky up

[Verse 2]
This the kind of night that feel perfect for some mischief
The spliff I lit reveals my worst intentions
The celebrated drive-in, slim chances of survivin'
They chose to take the ride it and had alot inside it, it crashed!
We're cross the lifts, broken ribs, missing teeth
Fingertips torn apart, spinal cord is incomplete
There's no more time to even blink
The cliff appears right before my eyes and spark things like...

[Outro]
I sold a dream for a few bucks

Evil laughter
