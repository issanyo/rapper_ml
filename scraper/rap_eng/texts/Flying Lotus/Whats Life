Whats life, whats right
Whats life, whats right
Whats life, whats right

And dreaming ain't only meant for the night

[Verse 1: Samoreye]

Had to stay awake for a day or two, disobey the rules
See you later dude, im just trying to live right
Funny how i step out of the crib the fog thick right
Wonder if venturing into would steady risk life

[Verse 1: Fuzzy]
What you know about life when you stand alone
When they ask you about your life you say man im grown
You ain't worried about a thing but you living off a check
Make it from the bottom then you trade it for respect

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Samoreye]

I ain't busy but I ain't trying to chill with a sus kid
Only outcome is the sus shit, Hitting up your beeper whats up kid
Samoreye spit with a rough lisp, something you still fuck with

[Verse 2: Fuzzy]
Twisted vision from a pull of the blunt
Am i tripping, thought i told this nigga pull up in front
When you delivering my weed, nigga get up and run
Cause ill be waiting on my porch with a carton of rum

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Samoreye]

Boss battle you stepped in the wrong castle
Feeling kind of woozy when you drank the wrong chattel
Its the poison in the drink, herb in the blunt
That will make a lame think if he really going to blink again

[Verse 3: Fuzzy]

Through the back door, shotty to ya wife
Tell them get the jewels, Fuzzy looking for that ice
Put it in the bag or im gonna tape her to a pipe
And let it burn away her flesh until i make it out of sight
