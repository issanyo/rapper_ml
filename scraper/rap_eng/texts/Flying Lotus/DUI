[Verse 1]
Sometimes you're alive
Sometimes you are dead inside
With the time to read between the lines of life and death
Sometimes it's okay
Sometimes it's the worst thing ever
Hopefully you won't get caught and get a DUI

[Verse 2]
You will see that it's not so bad
There's always tomorrow
Bottom of the glass
At this point you've made an ass
And your friends will let you know tomorrow

[Outro]
I'm so tired
One more glass to go
Where this ends we'll never know
