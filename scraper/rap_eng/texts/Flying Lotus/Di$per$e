[Verse 1: Kandresh]
Cold like the emotions of a killer
I'm a mother focker just like that nigga Ben Stiller
Been iller most claim they been trilla
I don't really give a fuck bout that pound sign emblem
Yeah, lets talk about who been realer
I'm authentic like a vinyl titled thriller
Roll with us, like you put in for the bud
I'm a little bit like Dexter a fanatic for the blood
Coming for your guts if you thinking you topping us
They ain't ever dropping us
Uno till the world combust
Ya'll should really know what's up
I could see by how they acting they rather have us fuck up
But I ain't ever slipping
& I ain't ever tripping
& I ain't ever sipping, my father taught me different
His kidneys should show the difference
That says a lot huh? my words are rock
Hit you stone solid
Seems this Buddha I copped keeping me more honest
Imma be here for a while causing more violence
Im wildin', make these rappers anxious, start to make them panic
Monster with a mean flow hidden in the attic
Women circling, 360, chilling with my niggas playing 360
Fuck with me if you know what's good for your soul
Kanman pure talent and a pot of gold

[Verse 2: Kandresh]
Get them motherfuckin' choppers ready
Like you bout to fly out
I'm taking your relevance so be ready to die out like a light bulb
I fight ya'll to death
Spitting out my soul it's nearly coming out my chest
I don't play boy
But I rather have a playboy bunny come over and have a play date boy
Ay boy, got me on this wave boy I will never change for these niggas
I remain for these niggas
Show them the peace and then bring pain to these niggas Kanman
