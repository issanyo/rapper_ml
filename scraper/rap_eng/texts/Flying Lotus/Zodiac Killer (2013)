(Verse 1)

Super smooth as I crept slow
I've never broke the law, but for your heart, I'ma kelpto'
Good rhythm, bad women, probably got the best flow
I caught some broads En'Vouge, that's probably why I let go
But oh no, not you mama, you kinda special
You left some niggas salty, because their game was kinda pretzel
Got it twisted, well let me have their position
I promise when I'm rapping, it's like Christmas, I'm way more gifted
But back to you mama, I hope it's all copacetic
I've read body language before, you're more poetic
Killin' the scene, babygirl I hope you know the medics
And them lips will turn a nigga diabetic in a second
Ain't nobody around, just me and you
And I gotta know your sign before you throw the deuce
The young track killa, you that ill so girl will ya
Gimme yo sign, cause I'm the zodiac killer

(Hook)

And I pulled up from behind, like "What's your name, what's your sign.?"
So I pulled up from behind, like "What's your name, what's your sign.?"

(Verse 2)

I met this Aries out in Paris infatuated with flattops
We was bumpin' heads like the St. Louis mascot
When I met that Taurus, man I thought I hit the jackpot
But she ain't take no bull, I was caught in a bad spot
I met some twins in the CHI, couple of Geminis
In love with Outkast, said they loved that song "Aquemini"
My cancer had them answers, I thought I seen something in her eyes
But she was walking sideways, that's crabwise
Now down in Rio, I met a Latino Leo
And her amigos got their dinero so illegal
I ain't with the lyin' so I went and seen my virgin
Called her Madonna, but mama was still thristin'
Keeping her detergent, that was my biggest challenge
Can't forget about my Libras who help me keep my balance
To be honest, I don't deal with Scorpios
Cause they're the type to have a nigga starring in the Maury Show
Back to the topic, I met a chick from the Agg
Super bad, said she was a Sag'
So I ain't understand why she ain't like it whenever my pants sag
To be real though, it couldn't have been that bad
My main chick from Dallas, she's the one I've never had before
I feel like I'm the GOAT, so it helps that she's a capricorn
Loved my Aquarius, in private she hilarious
BUt when we out in public, she's quiet as librarians
My little Pisces ride or dies into the very end
Her aim right but she shoot funny like Shawn Marion
She was acting fishy, so I guess I'm at the start again
The Zodiac Killer, taking signs and their hearts again..

(Outro)

So I pulled up from behind, like "What's your name, what's your sign.?"
I'll be glad to take your number, but I'd rather take your mind...
