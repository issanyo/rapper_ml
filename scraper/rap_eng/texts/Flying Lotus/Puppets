[Verse 1: Chester Watson]
It's like intellectuals went extinct
My consciousness saying that it's perpetual at the brink of the abyss
I sit at the exit and then dismiss
Higher knowledge like an extraterrestrial [?]

I'm only in this for revenue and the kicks
So you can catch me chilling with decimals in my clique
Throwing spliffs to the head and exhaling into a crypt
Where I'm from, niggas ruthless, they carry nooses and clips

[Hook] x2
I'm the puppet
Master
Controlling all these people with my fucking
Accent

Smoke much dope
Know his ruckus [?]
Busters
Can't say I ain't fucking classic

Clutching and worship

[Verse 2: Chester Watson]
Governor
Behead niggas
In all black
Reminiscing of cartel and fed niggas

Hard to tell
But he said wicked bread driven
Not hard to smell
Because the threads in it

The villain
Mega-mellow like he careless but he's hell-bending
And he the Wooki, never hairless but imperil sitting
So where your niggas because my niggas don't see narrow limits
With no campus steady painting pictures like we arrow knitting

[Hook]
Puppet
Masters
Controlling all these people with our fucking
Tactics

Smoke much dope
Know his ruckus [?]
Busters
Can't say we ain't fucking classic

Clutching and worship

[Outro: Tamara Davidson]
