[Hook Farell]
And Every time I see your smile, your smile, your smile
I get Butterflies and my hearts beats wild, beats wwild, beats wild
Lemme Get a Kid Lemme Get a Hug, Swear Baby got Me Fallin in love
I just wanna chill for a while, for a while baby ,x2
[Verse Ace Cartar]
Can I kick it, with you, for a little bit you
Got my mind on the level I was tryna get to
I dont want to get you honey imma let you be all you can be because your really something special
Thought i found something i lost the moment that i met you
It wasn't love at first sight but ill never forget you
And i respect you
Way to much to desire to drag you in a relationship that might wreck you
You see what im talking about
Look how my rhymes are coming out when im talking about you
And you guessed right everytime i said hey girl wassup i was talking about you
Im down to chill and i actually mean chill
Keep it honest and real i have no intentions concealed
Hey girl, I hope i am not meddling, Wassup wassup you deserve everything
[Bridge - Ace Cartar]
Hey girl lets take a break from this world and fly away nah i ain't tryna call you a bird im tryna getaway
An oasis awaits us, break away from father time come back to mother nature x2
