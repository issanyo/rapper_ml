[Intro]
Yeah
Straight from the heart
(straight from the heart now)
Listen (yo)

[Verse 1]
Cleaning my closets, these skeletons starting to decay
Deven don't fuck it up, we counting on yo ass to slay
Nobody wants to see the good ones die
But it could happen anytime that's how you know you alive
This is for the intellectual, the sapiosexual
Raise the revenue, the troop step in and bet its a spectacle
We just kids, you put us in this situation
We play the cards and wait until the day we say we made it
My Naptown state of mind, everything so divine
And I find that I just want to go my own way in life
Westside, born and raised, back in the brighter days
Smoking haze, be amazed, I got lyrics for days
This that soulfulness I'm in the zone
Nothing wrong, sing your song
Don't stay too long, move along
Kid theres so many beautiful things that you get to see
I know this world likes to hold you down, but don't ever sink
You a king don't you ever forget that shit
Get up off yo ass, get up on a track
And I want you to kill that shit
I know you got it in you, I see it the angels had told me
You heavensent to do this man just keep on at it you owe me
Cruz I know you feel like nothings good enough, but toughen up
You gotta believe in yourself if you know that no one does
I know she had you second guessing, like you wasn't worth it
But look below the surface, you can see that nobody's perfect
I was only 11 when my baby lungs had got a buzz
Now I'm tweaking every weekend I never thought I would
I'm high now, got a couple white owls
Ca$hmir coming through with the troop and we bout to burn it down
Slump on em, swank as ever it's so honest
And if hip-hop is dead, then I guess that we post mortem
I seen the higher consciousness, I know it exists
And as soon as you reach it you'll know what happiness is
I'm not stopping I'm on a plateau, I'll always be moving
Your life a movie, mine's a journey I'm just starting on Earth
And we moving on, to the upper echelon
And if you love it then doing it can't be wrong, gon' sing your song

[Outro]
Sing your song (repeated)
