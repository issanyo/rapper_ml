[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
Uh, uh, uh
Viktor wild islander, bringing out the child ya
Singing out the silencer with more violence than Heil Hitler
He gets some looks, some bullshit, pull over a dusty pull-over and a Pulitzer
A must we must busty your crusty sub-woofer sister
Foes is just bluffing, clear your nose from huff, puffing
A glutton for bludgeoning and blood gushing, here you go stud muffing, it's nothing
Get it on the get by, bet it on the dead guy, jet it on the red eye
Too many make mistake fillers, not enough live wires, too many fake killers and jive sires
Drop these bombs on a critic from a grass knoll, everybody got one, your mom's is an asshole
SOB and smug to the utmost, cut it close and catch a slug to the gut, boast: word to Thutmose
Whats worse? Clutch a purse close lady, we get more cheese bread for the baby, toast to Grady, 180

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm in the cut looking for some puss to pick apart
Dirty, like us riding in a whip that really isn't ours
Storming out the door, don't press record I hate my fucking voice
Trying to kill that noise, performing fill that void, slightly
I'm swimming in water that's been dicey since landing
And I'm owing these niggas nothing
Like all I've been handing for free
Don't pan your cameras to me, ho don't command me to speak
I got these little niggas swinging from the banners
Throwing facts in his pijamas
Walking slow because the cameras keep his stamina weak
And you can catch him like some halibut after a bad accident
Trying to get jaw jacked right where the captain had pieced
Out, Villain, Earl, Captain they commanding your street now
Rapping good as mother fucking janitors sweep now
Get the business handled, get the cannabis cheap now
It's a bunch of nuggets on him like sand on a beach towel

[Verse 3: Captain Murphy]
Captain's back (yay)
Go and put the mic away (where?)
Beside a microwave (oh)
When I die I bet you Mike'll wave
He blowing bubbles at the pearly gates
Took a selfie with the king but only seen my face
I'm writing darker pieces in my thesis
I'm hiding in the park with all your nieces
Trading head for Resse's pieces
And attacking niggas' verses with this book of witches curses
I cast a spell upon your bitches but my thirst is for the hearses
I’m spilling out my innards
To these n-words, journey inwards
Caught her quarter past the moment of past opponents
In a fragment of a moment man I killed that rap then owned it
Hope to overtake the planet, with my banana in a hammock
Bitches manic parents panic, I’m a mechanic with these patterns
Propagandic with that chatter, matter of fact the Mad Hatter
Never mind the hammer, manners out the window
Pump crescendo, puff the endo, I’m Lou Ferrigno
Just prentendo, don’t ask him where the pen go
Cause the pencil got me paper paid made them paint her
With the mask and faded sweatshirts, but nothing lesser
Bet you’ll never ever guesser what i left under the dresser
Hid a message in the 808 just to pester all the Heshers
