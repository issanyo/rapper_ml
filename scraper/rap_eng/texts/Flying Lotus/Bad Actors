Murk Mode

Yo
Dylan Ross by the wild grey goose chase
And I don't work like Aquafresh toothpaste
I'm tuning out every single word that you say
Cause I'm on a grind from Wednesday to Tuesday
I don't care about the he say she say you say that he's dope but I say that he's gay
Chronic masturbator can rip tapes faster
Than any 64 bar mixtape rapper
Cause I ain't even on a mixtape grind
But I guess I had to get it out of my system before it died
Cause I gotta lotta shit that be up in there
So I chop woo baby something like a Ric Flair
Dead stare
All day I rock bed hair
Cause I'm too busy making this music to fucking care
I rock a beat with perpetuated ease
By the Fly Lo legend yes! Thank you! Please
D Ross is a raggedy poor slob and he can still give you a jolt like a staticky door knob
Uh, I'm lazy right now
That is fucking lazy as shit but I don't care though
