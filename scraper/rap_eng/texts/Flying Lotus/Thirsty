[Intro: Spazzy D]
Ya, aye
Slow ride with it

[Verse 1: Spazzy D]
Today a white lady asked me if I was ashy
Are you only black
Or are you mixed with some type of Apache indian?
But then again every Indian has a daddy
Do you know your dad? Is he still around?
Or is he laughing inside an insane asylum
A criminal past behind him, he's cynical causing minimal damage but still
They find him, Guilty
Do you have a gun?
If I walked away would you take my purse and then run?
I know your that type of person
I know where you're from
The ghetto
So I know you'll probably shoot me for fun
Or shoot me cause you're a groupie for rappers
That sung, a song about violence
I hear silence cause you know that it's true
And you see the evidence piling
Why are you smilling?
I know that you're poor
Don't you use EBT at the grocery store?
Don't you watch BET when you walk through the door
Of your apartment, Apartment C second floor?
I know you and your story cause I've seen it before
I know all of y'all stories cause I've seen it before
I said lady you may be rich
But inside you are poor
You should drink water more

[Hook: Spazzy D] x5
You should Drink water more


[Verse 2: Spazzy D]
Today a white lady asked me if I was ashy
I told her not today
But my hair is naturally nappy
Looking at my face she can tell
I'm naturally happy
I actually love life
I guess I'm naturally sappy
She said
I don't get it like aren't you in love with chicken?
Infatuated with half naked women when they are stripping?
Are you a blood
Or you cripping?
You whipping it in the kitchen?
I know it's one or the other
None  of you brothers are different
I said
To be honest I've never been in a fight
I've never shot, picked up, or
Seen a gun in my life
I used to get bullied heavy
Helly students called me white
Cause when they heard a genius speak
They would think that we sound alike
But what is that sounding like?
Like where are you coming from?
For white to equal smart
Would mean that black would equal dumb
Black would equal having lethals
Pointed at your tongue
Over shoes, no soul, no toes
Can't run from the truth
