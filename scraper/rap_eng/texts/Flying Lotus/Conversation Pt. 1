[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In a spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 1]
Swear your life is basic
All you do is sit around the house you getting faded
That ain't entertainment, yeah
You missin' every single shot that you ain't takin'
Hey kid, you can use a little bit of your imagination
It can do you right improve a life you busy wastin'
Said it's your money if you make it
Otherwise it's just a conversation

[Bridge 1]
Okay, why you always hatin'?
Lacin' up my sneakers I be running out of patience
Yeah, it ain't your money 'till you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious

[Verse 2]
Everybody famous, everybody wild, everybody dangerous
Get a couple dollars now they actin' strange
Now they wanna give a couple statements
When you really about it you don't say shit
Pocket full of aces
Take over my city yeah that's really home invasions
All my homies with me gettin' busy no vacations
They ain't on my wave but they wavinâ€™
Stop boy you runnin' through your savings

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, I just feel amazing
My head up in the clouds but my feet be on the pavement, yeah
It ain't your money 'till you make it
Otherwise, it's just a conversation

[Chorus]
We ain't on the same shit, no way
You ain't from my planet we don't speak the same language
This is an occasion, ain't it?
I'm feeling good and they hate it
Shit I don't recognize these faces
Yeah, where you from who you came with?
Started in the basement
Made it way above the top, now I'm in the spaceship
In the spaceship, shit is spacious
