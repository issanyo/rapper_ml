[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Fly-Lo
Its Tha Barz

[Verse]
Imma let this blunt be my incense
Inhale the fumes let it soak into my consciousness
Just to tame my thoughts so all my bars won't be so monstrous
Lyrical Apocalypse what difference does it make
When you stand and facing the god
So blasphemous feelin like a narcissistic
Lord have Lamborghini mercy on this college kid
Fuck a scholarship i roll with scholars
--and culinary artists flying lotus cookin crack this papers the pyrex
Think my verse was never fly go suck a dick inside this cockpit
Ah shit --- gotta dumb it down for these duns
Something simple like all my bars are hotter than the sun
Who the fuck they are to tell me i can't go beyond these boundaries
Sounds to me they labeled me illegal atlien
Who landed in Atlantastan Big Van Mastodon
Roll with Doravillains through the slums of Banglanta bruh
So raise your plastic cups even if its filled with chai
Grab the biggest biscuit then you dip it till its all gone

[Hook]
Watching soggy rappers drift away like pangea
Nigga stand clear you ain rockin cashmere
Quit flexin don't be claiming that you Wagner
Quit flexin don't be claiming that you original
Quit flexin don't be claiming that you Wagner
Quit flexin don't be claiming that you original
