All plans begin & end
Depends on where you go
& all pain don’t mean nothing don’t hang on let it go
& all things are planned above & so is the below
& our planet means more things more great than physical

(oh ah)
Nothing Controls Us

All things within non-physical
Mind games are made for their control
Our last names not same with your soul
I’m me don’t need no visuals

Nothing Controls Us
