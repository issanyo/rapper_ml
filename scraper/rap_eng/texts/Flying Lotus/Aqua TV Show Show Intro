[Verse 1: Captain Murphy]
Uh, uh-uh, ooooh
Welcome to paradise
Now, leave all your worries and
Other TV shows behind baby
It's time for Aqua TV Show Show

[Chorus]
[Frylock] Aqua TV Show Show
[M Shake] Aqua TV Show Show
[Meatwad] Aqua TV Show Show
[Captain Murphy] I said Aqua TV Show Show
[Frylock] Aqua TV Show Show
[M Shake] Aqua TV Show Show
[Meatwad] Aqua TV Show Show

[Verse 2: Captain Murphy]
I said Master Shake, Frylock, my little homey Meatwad
Lotus on the beats, yeah we heavy in the streets
Yeah we got the whole planet in the palm of our hands though
So give thumbs up for the Aqua TV {*scratch*} {*laughter*}
