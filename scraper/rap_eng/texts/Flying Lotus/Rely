[Verse 1: Via Rosa]
There's gonna come a day in your life
When you're not gonna understand left from right

You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
You can't rely on nobody
