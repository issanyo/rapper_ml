Bakayaro, no, konoyaro
You know how I flow, it’s Nova Da Blade I’m so fresssshhhh...
Cool as a fan, nicer than a tipped waiter
Cast black magic every time that I spit, haters
I beat Earth, Wind, Fire & Ice
Outta opposition so think twice if you wanna survive the night
Ridiculous, the flow so meticulous
The young scholar bumping incubus
Emcees ain't ready for this, ever dismissed
You've never witnessed any ish like this, ill as the ish
I deliberately spit, venom to destroy innocence
Homeboy you just burned out, the price of arrogance
I am webster's definition of a badass
Cuz I fistfight in fight clubs in the badlands
Meanwhile you stay coonin like' Mantan
We so shinobi wit it, dagger in the offhand
Then we hit you with the offhand backhand
Just to show you we ain't never played it like Pac Man
We are original and awesome like black sand
While you just the same old act Like a Dat Phan
