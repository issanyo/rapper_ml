[Verse 1]
Quit it, we get it you rap
Quit it, we get it you that
Kid are you kidding? you killing it that is a fact
You're putting nap on the map
You are the truth
You got the back of my tooth, wisdom
When in the booth, you let it loose
Clean it and polish it too
Then you show it to the fairy for proof
You're gonna make it I know that you knew
And you know you deserve it for all that you do
Even my momma in love with you too
And she hates every rapper well except for you
Because you did it, stop being modest admit
You made it without ever degrading women
The future is all up to you
Don't let em stop it, just do what you do
GET IT!

[Hook]
Don't stop, get it, get it

[Verse 2]
Quit it admit it you suck, quit it admit it you butt
You can't even rap! You rap about helping the world
I'd much rather hear about whipping it up in the trap
Whipping and flipping a brick
Pistol whipping when you hitting a lick
Booty grabbing when you up in the club
And getting pretty women you know to strip
That's what we want, that's what we need! Greed!
Money tree where is the seed cheese!
My family gotta eat, I feed them watches and diamonds and rings
Ain't that what they need?
Well that's what the radio said
The radio rappers that rap about bread
But that isn't true, just do what you do
The future is all up to you
GET IT!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aye, and this is my year
When I ask 'who's the man' they say look in the mirror
Got to use to asking for help now I do this myself
Man I got it from here
They're actually mad at me cause
I'm your majesty, king me
I'm ready, I'm with it believe what I say if I said it I did it
You know that I kill it just say you admit it
And I am not perfect
But look at me and see the effort I'm giving
Do not try to narrow your vision
The spot at the top man was not my decision
When spitting I'm hoping you listen
It doesn't cost money to pay me attention
As lord as my savior I pray my behavior gives me recognition

[Hook]
