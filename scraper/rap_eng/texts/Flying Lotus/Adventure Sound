[Verse 1: AK]
The eye on my forehead strong, like ion
Lyrical time bomb, burning holes through your teflon
The Painquillizer has arrived, your faith is on the line
Paper on the vine I inhale, and exhale the pine vapors all the time
Come a bit closer, get reacquainted with the messiah
Fuck astral planes, I seek higher
That limbic, try us, and one will find home within a lion
Triumph, I wear the belt like Orion
Indigo, individual, in the physical form
Spawn, you're a pawn in this chess game, check mate
Check if my check straight, check off that check, dog
Wordplay, I'm Cassius Clay, castaway, a tragic grace
Sometimes you gotta be secluded so your mind you can reclaim
You mere mortals can't tear portals, dimension and shift soil
With ascending masses, endo passing, leave them gassed with
Knowledge of our ancient ways
Better find yourself, elevate your brain
Meditate from the buddah like Buddhists
AK the truest, bluest Indigo huest
Jupiter origin soaring foreign the force within third eye
Swerve by the demons haunting men

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
The mind explorer of foreign towns
My Adventure Sound keep you niggas lifted
Break up a pound, no demons found
Hidden in our rasta, keep out all imposters
UA proper, got the knowledge from on top us
Golden rastas, holy fathers watch us prosper
Family first, niggas connected like we some mobsters
Uh, and yeah we float when we smoke
Sour so potent you choke, nigga we on a new coast, toast
I put up a force-field of eloquent verses
Rehearse, with the lords of this rap shit, the masters
We can't quit, or get your fucking third eye stripped
I'm focused, only a god could have wrote this
Levitating, a nigga flying with the savior
A creator of a haven, safe from haters
Perpetrators can not enter my medulla
Hallelujah, I'm the young light bearing shooter
We paving the way, changing the game, making our lane
Nigga, fuck is you saying, uh
UA came to the game, to save the day, making a change
How you gon' stop this nigga from feeding brains
