We're belligerent when it comes to illiterates
Ignorants only interest
Is the money and fame
That comes with the game
Don't fuck with no basics
Don't fuck with no lames

My only interest from you
Is to remember this name..

You-better-have trife tribe in your veins
Cause our lyrical power is making you sane
So step in our lane

We spit raw Dopeness
For you Dope-heads
To keep you numb on
Your coke shift
We close to coast bitch

So smoke to this
While we smoke shit
To get your ho lit
And focus on this flow spit

Cause we fit to commit
Admit that we can toke it
Or you can choke it
Step out of our way to show biz
Nigga

Ever since an ill minded infant
Always been sick with
Nursery rhymes schooling nitwits
Call me a misfit

We've been snatching goody bags
Ya girls been in Our Crib since
Suckin Baby bottles to lickin tips

Cause I unchap Lips
When she mentions Pics
You say I got no bars
Really?
Cause your iphone couldn't fit this

Cause i'm addicted to the hit list..
You better PROTECT YA NECK
Cause my crewnecks ..to be killin it
