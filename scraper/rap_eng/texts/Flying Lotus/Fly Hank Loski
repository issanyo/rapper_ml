[Verse 1: Henry McCoy]
I roll my dice, you probly catch me in plain sight
Lampin' down by Jefferson, tuckin' a blue knife
Violent vibrant, all we're recording and reach this horror
War that sounds cold, controlling and taking over
My shoulder frozen over, these women who play cobra
Got to get my dough up my water is boiling over
Too much of a nice cat that wants to be accepted
I had a change of heart, I'm aggressive, full progression
These brothers half stepping on balance with dome weapons
A lone wolf will blaze in the basket, chin checking
Reach god and teach with technique, my flow is so unique
I break beats and flee to the beach
On a first class flight, you probably wish that you could smite me
No weapon that is formed, I don't care if your don't like me
Embarrass every coward who would dare try to fight me
Then protest God son when your feet are in the heat

[Hook 2x: Henry McCoy]
What's your issue, huh? Grab your tissue hon'
My brother call me son cause I shine like one
So when I start to speak you will see the sky open
Fly lo, hang low, cif is the dopest

[Verse 2: Henry McCoy]
Paid dues, made moves, play cool, grace soon
I waste it tight, shine bright, then bloom
Send kites my way, I feast more beats
We eat all day, no way we sleep
Straight shots to the jewels, they glisten, I listen
Words writin' in the book, this is knowledge for the guilty
Just slipping, just a little, see my hand moving slow
I thought I told you one time that my soul's much older
So I go a little deeper on the rhymes when I teach 'em
And you sleeping on the season of the most impressive preachers
From the southern side of Richmond, it's them James river ninjas
Rep Virginia, be precise when the audiences listen
On the bloc, they just waiting for improvement, I'ma do it
With exclusive technique, I'm just cooling like I'm cool and
I'm shooting for the artists of the year, make it clear
That their time grows near, new heroes have appeared

[Bridge: Henry McCoy]
So face it, if you put your shine in the time
You gotta take it, my fam' got a bond through this grind
Can't break it, that's why we gon' make it
Because the dedication, because I got, got it all


[Hook]
