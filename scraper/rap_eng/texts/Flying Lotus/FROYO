[Verse 1: SNOWJ]

They say
Video killed the radio star
Bitch I am the both of them
Todd told me to stop talkin
How about you call me when you're raps are 10s

All we doin is talk (psyche)
All we doin is rock
Got the buildup with that hype
Gabbro stalagmite

Got the heat and we just might
Use it now it's fight or flight
If you're listening to this shit
You're finally doin somethin right

And I'm throwin down the punches
If you don't like the JC
If you're doin somethin new
Then you're probably doin me

You probably just a dream queen
Bitch I am reality
Making these rappers fall
Autumn, call me gravity

Better be knowin me for my brevity
Heavenly higher up
Can't be gettin on my level, see
You're too low to be sayin sup

It's all fucked up
I am the Deku
You are just the scrub

And I'm your source for music
Gettin it got it fuckin
Tickethub

And we got it on the down-low
Retarded assholes
We on it like
Underground hoes

Flow you know I'm speakin death
Callin it River Styx
Fuck your shit
Cause Satan is my main bitch

[Interlude: DIZZY K]
As you know, that was the one and only Snow-J
After a short break this song will be continued by a Fluffy-T Huggin'
We here at S-W-A-G FM would like to remind you that patience is a virtue, so stay tuned

[Verse 2: FLUFFY T HUGGIN'/DANGER-T]

Keep switching
He said Satan is his main bitch
But we don't give a goddamn
So hold the fucking sales pitch

I know you're itching
For a little more Fluffy T
Keep giving me loving
But I bury their hearts like six feet deep

And you are craving
A lady to lay your hands on
So listen to my tips
They'll get you bitches like you're Wondervon

I mean business
BeNasty be gathering business skills
But unlike him
I'm jerking myself off to pay the bills

60 USD
For me to masterbate
You know it's the standard rate
For my concentrate, but for you? It's free

Living blasphemy
It's the Masta-T outrappin' you
Big Stone could too
So don't you think about fuckin' with us

Our crew
We'll make the shit you do the old news
Like you got shit to attend to
And we got time to hit the snooze

So take this seriously
And don't commit a sin
Against the Dizzy Gods when it's you verse us
You know you'll never fuckin' win

[Verse 3: BeNasty]

Hey
I’m BeNasty
Happily hittin the beat
Like the pencil you bring to math
Your wife is a cheat, with me
Mess with me

And she will bleed
She’s abouta concieve but truth be
Its probably, a mini me
Finishin strong
On everything
Except for this song

Call me coconutt
You’re bound to get poked in the butt
But

This line
We replaced it
It was racist
My lyrics are dumb

I love whales, cause
“THAR SHE BLOWS”
This goes to show
I’m the one, you fuckin gotta know
Cuz I started the flow of my bros

My raps have got you
Frozen, like the ice cream cup, I’m said chosen
But worth almost none
Cuz I’m from
Washington

Never mention the sun
Cause
As much as I fuck I don’t fuckin have one
My dick weighs a megaton so
Only one that is fuckin dumb

Would mention some thoughts, of my fun
Cause on this track I’m havin none
Almost the opposite of the
First line
Like the styles of dizzy and mine

Leavin me wonderin why
I have more views
They say dizzy rules, Nasty drools
But bitch, clearly they’re fuckin fools

Penetrate them to birth squad de dudes
No matter how much you like burgers
Together we school all fools in duels

So
If ya fuck with us
Your nuts are bound to bust
Bitch
