[Verse 1: ScottyP]
Listen here cheese its bleeze zees and a box of beer
This message isnt sincere, its a bullet through the ear(yea)
My life tends to be crazy filled my some ladys
And eyes low with haze yuh see
Packed with a little debbie snack cake
Third of weight of ham and a cold glass milkshake
He goes to his day pay
Slangin' hay keeps other stress away
With the dough exchange
Back to the cheese its the trees lit
Not a christian feast but a green hit of OG shit
Rewind to a simpler time better state of mind
Put a lime on a bud light just to save some time
And its a crisis these gas prices they keep rising but mine they stay low tide(yea)
And imma eat these lays we need this time to save lives instead of opening another murder case
Scotty probably the realest to touch a mic with karate words tsunami damage and is lady like
They tell me to back off you probably just finished jackin' off with taco bell sauce at a frat loft...lost
Not knowing where the fuck you are you see a guy with a guitar a story and a war scar
In the middle of nowhere you don't care body is sweaty and you need to change your fuckin' underwear
