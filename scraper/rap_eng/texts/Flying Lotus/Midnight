[Verse 1]
Feeling strong around the seven sins
My ghost is floating – Heavens Gate
Originate the fallacy that brings me to the apple tree
And hating on the Cooper D, be nothing but the enemy
What is all this lunacy? The captain speaks in riddles, T
Taking losses like families in the orphanage
I lack the common sense to see more friends than followers
Hate it – but I respect nobody more than my own face
Berate what society creates and mates with all of the hates
Latest news that the crews been kinda loose
Purple drank flowing - all over the blues
Problem solved by the mainstream media news
Analytics on probation, some may call vacation
On the - children of the Lacy pagans
Let me explain it for the illiterate fucks
We cannot fight in the octagon with no puns
This is no Ex-Military, still got more shots than Takyon

[Verse 2]
Fuck it all, I raise the bar, for every rapper in this war
My spaceship is a masterpiece, some may call it centipede
Finger snapping, blunt blazing, oh you feel so damn amazing
I was raised by Bloody Mary, not the good one, but the baddy
Lately I’ve been kinda drowsy by the Oxy from Miss Cocktail
Rider, cider doughing piece of shit am I to the neck and bite
Mac and Cheese for all my wives and their minors
Throw me lighters, super tight is, that we get to dynamite this
Write your number, I’m your plumber, filling up your tubes
9 months later, in the air with strippers and my underwear
And a big ass bear in the mirror – oh that’s just me on the shitter
Man, the LSDs been such a tripper
The pastor left the building, kids, return to be the master

[Outro]
Violence is the pillar on which all societies are built and its repression is tantamount to societal collapse
Thus, the notion that “violence is never the answer” is a laughable one. We teach (or rather, our governments teach) our children that violence is wrong, that they must never use it, no matter what. The aim of this is to create a society of slaves who will never protect themselves when abused
It is slave morality and we must emancipate ourselves from it. Yes, violence is acceptable, in certain conditions. It may not be desirable, but it becomes acceptable – say, necessary – if one hopes to have a complex and functional society
Otherwise, what you have is merely a parody of a society, a human organization, which does not work for the good and improvement of humanity, but for the glory of its sociopathic leaders
