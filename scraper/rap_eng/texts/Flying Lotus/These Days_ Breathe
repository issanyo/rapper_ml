I been high since the... (x7)
I been high since the intro

[Verse 1: Amar Chong]
Hi, I am your highness
My mind is somewhere on top of the climate
That's where I'm tryna climb at
I'm climbing in that kayak
Paddle through her waters, I tell her climb off at the climax
Cause every time I try, I waste time just re-finding where her mind at
Tryna make me main, don't try that
Won't even buy that unless its all gold everything, Midas
Your added drama was a minus
And yea I mind it, but never mined it
No 49er, thought you was slick because you wore designer
But nothing's finer than a woman with a whores desires
To get inside her and decipher what her core inspires
And have a minor only if you can support the diapers
Or else you're fired, uh, and keep her moaning till her voice is tired
Um, I been around, tire, she bending down, tryna give it to her sire, and I'll oblige her

[Hook]
These days, I'm just tryna free my mind, I'm just tryna free my mind(x3)
These days, she just tryna be my mind, but I'm just tryna free my mind

[Verse 2: Amar Chong]
And I'm a star, see my constellation from afar
But fuck it all, my mind is on Mars
I'm tryna reach it, if I can see it, I shall seek it
And keep it, to myself like a secret
Rap Jesus, I was once a rap genius
Then I exceeded to the point my raps were Re-ligous
Or ridiculous, I'm sorry pardon
My language has been contained in a cage so I'm always barkin'
I'm cold hearted, and cold blooded, the flow cold so my hoes cold
I love smoke, so I'm puffin till its slow mo
I blow dro, so loud like sirens of po po
Oh, 5-0 tryna hold a nigga, 5 O's in the "Blaze Cave"
So fried that I'm smoking nigga, my minds gone so welcome to my brain waves

[Bridge]
My brain waves, welcome to my brain waves (x3)
Anyway...

[Hook]
These days, I'm just tryna free my mind, I'm just tryna free my mind (x3)
These days, it's something different all the time, so I'm just tryna free my mind

[Verse 3: Amar Chong]
Sometimes I get lost in your eyes, other times I get lost in the sauce
Prolly why I can't get you outta my thoughts
But this real love got me thinking out of "the box"
No love for a thot, that's the lesson that's taught
Cuz it's more brain, less of a heart
You sweet though, even though it seems your methods are tart
Accented, leave intestines in knots, see I like you a lot
A flower compromised by the pot
You were everything that I sought
I'm glad you came around these ways, you the reason that I smile these days (x3)

[Hook]
But these days, I'm just tryna free my mind, I'm just tryna free my mind (x3)
These days, its seeming like I lack the time, so I'm just tryna free my mind

(BREATHE)

[Verse: Amar Chong]
Depression settin' in
My heart is heavy as the bevies of a sediment
Ready for the questioning
Told you that I loved you but you rarely let it settle
Fore you stop answering texts again, got me feeling desolate
Wollow in my cell and sit
The loud is part of my bravado cause I'm selling it, times are kinda desperate
You were the sun shining down on my presence in the shadows with the treacherous
Tryna get ahead, lost my footing on the ledge again
I'm free falling to a cauldron that my stress is in
So anybody talking depth is just pedestrian
I'm walking in the lane where the best begin
So free fall to my death again
But any chance of having you I'm resurrecting it, so my breath begins
I inhale exhale with the best of em'
Ready for the next event
Breathe In Breathe out
