[Intro: Mike, The Emcee]
Yo one, two,(3x)
One, one two,(2x)
Yo , Yeah , Don't Judge Me
Don't Judge Me
Don't Judge Me
Don't...Don't Don't

[Verse 1:]
Not constantly stressin
About my profession
Who could've guessed that kid was a weapon
Misses missed my conception , that's a miss misconception
Y'all would blame it on the youth, when they shoot instead of tested
My roots run deep
I'm Sudanese
No blues for me
History bores me
Still craving for the day the ladies adore me
The name changes is brain banging I'm sure
Seathing backwood out the back door with my back towards opponents
This is rap war, Who you rap for? White rap owners or your homies
Not an actor but I act like these lines would lead to bonuses
Having hand outs for homeless men hoping that their next night isn't spent hungry
Show a few components, viewed as gorgeous on this colorful assortment
Still tugging mics until it's cordless
My porch lit up a portrait of people killing each other
Lit up portions of their neighborhoods
Brothers killing their brothers
Tryna show em all a reason to love one another
Tampa to Inglewood can we change?


[Interlude: Demetrius Bradshaw]
Nigga, (can we change?)(9x)
But okay but Like I'm not afraid to die or anything because,(
I mean everybody's bound to die it's nothing that's not gonna happen
Like nobody will live forever but
The Way I see it like
What i'm tryna do , I'm tryna let people know that there is a greater purpose to life than just.. Trying to live forever


[Verse 2:]
Yo
All rise, let's settle the confusion
Y'all know I spit fire so prepare to get your fuse lit
The flow so fluid
Dumbest reality
I make my own salary, understand why y'all mad at me
My lyrics are cavalry, punchlines are cheat codes
I beat the game 3 times y'all still playing BMO
Don't act like yeen know, this emcee could spit
If I define my girl in copper coins she'd be ten cents
But man mind ya business, my futures inevitable
Demigod of Hip Hop my awards on a pedestal
Next to a schedule, of colorful faces
Calendars a rainbow , aye Nathan black faces
Reference childish, but flow so Donald
Doesn't sound half as bad as a black soprano

Oo!
