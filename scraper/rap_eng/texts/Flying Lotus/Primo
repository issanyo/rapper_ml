[Verse 1: ChadAttack]
So you Ask what we got in common?
To translate to my power first you'll need a shaman!
In his Rucksack some deadly concoctions
Empty out the ingredients into his cauldron
What filled the mold well ill state the following
Purple, and vice and everything thats Yikes!
Could have sworn I was cooked up by Walter White!
Mean as a menstrual Cycle between the legs of dykes
Flowing like the air shafts of some pyramids in egypt
Like clogged toilet pipes yall niggas sealant
Full of more shit than squat toilets of an indian
Thats if you think your even coming in as decent
Dirty as a x tape of Catholic priest
Guest starring your nephew in nothing but bleached black dirtbag tees
And none of you will want to beef because a piece of me can upset the bellies of beast

Chorus
Let it breath like
Let it breath
Let it Breath like
Let it breath

[Verse 2: ChadAttack]
I'm just a good kid with a tried conscience
Taking out anything in for his prospect
In the end I'm trying to get all the dead pres for a conference
Kids are on some backside BS I've been on a crook grind
Ever since a infant
Team is popping tommys
Can't be controlled if your last name was lipshitz
I'ma be that primo nigga ankle breaking kickflip
Gonna swear that Paul Bunyon was the one that made the imprint
On the road for other than some trees to steam
Is some cracker dips and some cheese
What else do you ask for in this world of cream
Just a teen potfiend chasing after some large dreams
Niggas made so they want to go and call me Oreo
Shit I've been that cookie dough ever since an embryo
I'll Kill them all in a minute chance that name to Terio
Bitch!

Chorus
Let it breath like
Let it breath
Let it Breath like
Let it breath
