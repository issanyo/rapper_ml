Rah!
Come build with me
Be in the vicinity of G-O-D
Roar with the lions
Use my subliminal mind
And create divine rappers with divine rhymes
Got damn I made it crossed faded
Lyrically elated
Gravitated to the ground under
Rap Varlet my Goddess
I promise
To hit niggas with my lyrical pro 24-7 Taurus
The target
Niggas walking around with fat pockets
Lyrically they sound retarded
Regardless
Pardon me but all Eye see with my iris
Are our talents stolen by melanin recessive pirates
Modernize malice I'm Osiris
I sip chlorophyll from my chalice
Had a son with Isis
I'm reborn Horus
Lyrics are morbidly obese
The soul orbits
From the 19th to the 1st galaxy
That means you need to be
A super Sayiun
To battle me
The highest fliest
The lyrics are deep
The mind is solid like hard concrete
Yo!
