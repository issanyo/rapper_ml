I don't even know why I try
I don't even know if I fit in
I don't even know why I try
I don't even know if I like what I've written
I don't even know why I try
I don't even know if I like the flow I'm spittin’
I don't even know why I try
I just don't fucking know

[Verse 1]
Back to school uh I'm jumping on an old flow
But I ain't fucking famous so that's a flow that you don't know
Oh man, why so serious?
We the worst generation that's why the man be fearing us
We overdose cos no one want to be hearing us
We over dope that's why the pills be killing us
We the worst generation that's why no body feeling us
So delirious they bust any crew that’s anything plus deux
Which is just nuts fuck I just want to gut some fucks
That can't leave a kid alone to just busk a rhyme
They’ve gotta take his dimes that he put in the time
To buy a dime man not a diamond, he a hustler
Selling laundry powder to the little kid customer
He doesn’t know what he's doing to this kids life let alone his own
Just thinks this is the only way to get on the throne
But no one watching him cos hustling is no longer an art
Especially when you pill pressing cleaning products from k-mart
But everything else you got is designer gear
Buying new shit so Houston no longer has a problem here
That’s right you Harden and Linsanity writing profanity on the vanity you questioning humanity
Trying to fit in like a step dad in a new family
Who you think you are? You really gonna stop Kony?
Claiming its so horrible, you thirty years late phony
You watched a YouTube video, that don’t make you an activist
If you really want to do some good, you can expand my fans and rap to this
