[Verse l ]

Dead man walking
Dead man talking
One man on a
Dead man walking
Dead man talking
One man on army
Like nigga fuck you squadron
Woke up in a coffin
Death is not an option
Killer of that pop shit
Wild like a mosh pit
Fuck all of that op shit
On that kill a cop shit
When im done they gonna need a janitor to mop shit
Myth like im loch ness
Always dropping hot shit
Living so lawless
Spit it so flawless
Don't care about your hardships
We just want that hard shit
That make you tear your hair out till you ripping out the carpet
That carnage
Guarantee go harder then the hardest
Never half assed I always finish what i started

Out of this orbit
I'm morbid
You niggas corny like Norbit
Should forfeit the competition
Better off signing petitions
That would banish me
No manager can manage me
No nigga can damage me
Just to much to handle see
Been a rocky road ever since I killed rock and roll
Pop a punk in any country right after I snatch that soul
Niggas acting like hoes don't know how to play they role
Never saw the post yet I stay Hitting all my goals
Sipping on that bitches brew
Fire what I spit at you
Liable to Kill crew
In less of a syllable
Block bullshit like a goalie
Sock a bitch nigga in the jaw Mick fooley
X only slave name lames never sold me
Can't draft a god Jesus the one and only
Kill shit kony
Off that white pony
I ain't playing games with you niggas fuck sony
I any smoking shit with you niggas hope you O.D
Nah there ain't no bitch in me nigga that's ya homie
Hits hard like pistol whips
Heavy bong rips
And Bass kicks
Just making these waves quick
Left em on a pavement
Face fully caved in
See you in hell
Hope you have a nice vacation
