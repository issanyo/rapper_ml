[Verse 1 : Lord Majin]

Flow bottomless like tar spits in the mosh pits
Monotonous bars spit like cheers turn to carcasses
Carvin' heartless novices regardless
If there harmless like sniper hands with parkinsons
Livin' in no rememberance remember this
Ill limmericks given to militant dominican immigrants
Who don't listen like rappers who lack discipline
Disciples decipher liars tired code sold tired old
And thrust it back into the fire like I was Richard Pryor
Prior to the fact that I'm a Wordsmith with the words lift with magical verbs spit

Make a hit out of weak shit call me somethin like a sire
Somethin like a villain Hogans black and white attire
Life sucks but i had a goodyear like a tire
Rappers talk shit leave 'em singin like a choir

Flow goes higher and higher and leave a nigga stranded like Macgyver
