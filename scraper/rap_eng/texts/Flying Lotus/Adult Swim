Flying Lotus

[Verse 1]
Reminiscent my mother sit in the kitchen
Back when water whippin was solely doing the dishes
After school with my father baseball was the only pitching
He taught me early commission was solely based on commitment
Spit it
Intricate even Freddie vouch for the wordplay
While I was ripping tracks off of hip hop early
Even without that blue check bet my skills verified
Was taught to fear no man though God I'm terrified
They say I'm next up I would I would tend to agree
To a, certain degree man who better than me
Niggas in my city switching style like they from the south
Married to the game while your daughters garter be all in mouth
She cook chorizo and egg then pass the culo
Rarely see her father she calling me papi chulo
Black american story thats reminiscent of Juno
Venus vs Mars and I ain't talking bout bruno
Nigga what!

Reporting live...from the 219

[Verse 2]
The revolution will be televised
Little black boy who Tom Cruise vanilla skies
See through real eyes that realize the real lies
Feel the window pane you get baked they steal pies
Back when me and Chi used to bang on my desktop
Bumping Thin Lizzy in cities where only crack rock
Paint a perfect picture I Walter Johnson the backdrop
Always been ahead no ties you better ask Scott
Raps Moses, spit dopeness on flying lotus
You dont hear the hunger as flying locusts send my condolences
Back of the bus flowing a dozen of all my roseses
Packing the fallen petals we pushed to prepare this potent with
Teaching them through my music like classes of Holland Opuses
Vocal my point is focal I wonder now where their focus is
How they solve all the violence in Chicago?
Close 50 schools and worry bout it tomorrow
Nigga what!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Name any track that I ain't poop on
Like any verse I read I ain't nupe on
Like step, step, roof!
Look up and the roof gone
While y'all saving bitches like the kitty was coupons
Told you I'm on fire while you niggas is lukewarm
Cause everything I'm hearing sound just like the last song
Lately, I been, tired of rap
Might just drop this mixtape and never go looking back
Cause fact becoming fiction and fiction becoming fact
Written in 16's recorded over some trap
Nigga what?!
What the fuck is you saying?
Everything sound good with autotune and delay in
We all are fishers of men
These women be fish filleting
I been myself from the start and really don't plan on changing
Just fucking these beats up
You other rappers abstaining
So good at like everything
Don't know which lane I'mma stay in
