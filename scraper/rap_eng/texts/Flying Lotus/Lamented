[Verse 1]
I'mma lower the brightness on my Mac book, till the screen look like a black book
Gold lettering and I pre-occupy what weather brings. For worse to better sings I can hear the melodies of a goddess
Genus comes from a peony, beautiful's meant to be honest. Added this is I cleanse illness
This is my refinement(?), her name is Karmen, nickname her Karma cause when she come around that's another sound
I'm a prisoner for her wines, Cabernet, or her bourbon cause I go from cold to having a sweat

[Hook]
I just wanna drink out of your cup (sweat, sweat, sweat)
I just want to drink out of cup, I just wanna feel your body bang, body bang, body hit me(?)
I just wanna be comfortable(?). (You know I just wanna become the, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Nigga this Higashi Miyagi fresh off that water boat
I went swimming in someone's daughter and I caught her throat
I auto-boast, inaudible…replays? I’m too hard to quote
Wave to the losing opposer and the poser and disregard the floats
Amphibian, and Caribbean, Shorts and flops you seem me in, but this swagger you can't take on
Go and attempt to beat me then, but can he (?), women and tiki sippin, genie wishin
My phones home on the charger, left a note told you "gone' fishin"
Now how'd I come up missin'? Bitch you don't pay attention, but you stay bitchin'
I just wanna be comfortable livin' life, livin' life, livin'
