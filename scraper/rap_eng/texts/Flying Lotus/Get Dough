[Vandalyzm talking]:
Don't know what the fuck this shit be at the beginnin'. Flying Lotus is a fool (Flying Lotus on the beat!). Gonna have some fun with this one right here. Ya dig? Yeah, let's go. Uh huh

Can I get it get it in? (Get it in man)
Can I get it get it in? (Get it in man)
Can I get it get it in? (Get it in man. Get it in.)

[Verse One]:
Listen
It's Majorz bitch
Get your ma'fuckin' mind right
Rhymes shine bright, every line like a limelight
Shades on 'em with the haters on 'em
Transforming fake on 'em when they fate is on 'em
But I play upon 'em
Kick game, David Beckham, I'm the shit man, real playa on her
You ain't know?
You messin' with the V.S
Hoodie, greedy genius, jeans be our P.S
Fresh S.P.s, chicken I'm a genius
Fitted on lean, trick get up on the penis
Don't ask it
See you either down or you out
If you down then you clown then I'm out
You nodded off fam you nodded off
Wanted time, took, grabbed the seat then I signed you off
Two of 'em, holla
Don't need ? man I'm tryin' to get these dollars patna

[Hook]:
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough

[Verse Two]:
Hold up
I'm back in this
Like Buffy The Body's ass nigga I'm crackin' this
I get to crackin' I'm harder, I spit you back in the water
You need a gallon to start up
So while you practicin', I done already wrapped you up partner
I'm probably a modern day martyr
My words give the hood a lift, my mind is a mortar
Or a mechanical mission and minus the starter
The key in ignition, I slam it down, alright you can start 'er
I'm superb with superlatives
Submerged in the words when I emerge man I murder it
Killin' 'em with game, I'm revealin' 'em with pain
I dismember and maim so they rememberin' the name
Vandalyzm
I drill it in your brain
Till the simple mention of me leaves a chillin' in your veins

So I already got lightheaded. Blacked out in this motherfucker

[Hook]:
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough
And that's the way it goes
Money over B's no time for the bros
We livin' like G's, it's the contest to pros
Get money, get bread, get skrilla, get gwap, get dough
