Delta nine
The Holiday Cookie
Acronym active ingredient
Tetrahydrocannabinol up in this delicious dessert
What am I getting myself involved in
Evolving and revolving around all I experience
Can a cookie cut through your cranium with such ease, really?
Please, leave me alone
No need for smoking leaves
I see such beautiful things

Break into your brain
Break your brain in two
A half wit
Heady split
Slick spitting
Take a swig
Liquor quick
Licorice
Lick her ass
Holy shit
Lick her fast
Sober, liquor fast

Sobriety so bright
Eyes blinded by the
Dimmest of lights
Diminished intelligence
Taken a notch down
Retard meaning slow
Musically I mean no
Offense, not mean
I mean, no boundaries
Barbed wire won't stop me
From entering your property
Mycologically speaking
I find my magic free
Fields of fun
Guys lets get high and ruin the fucking world
Set things on fire
Setting up a place
To abuse the psychedelic laced organism
Organic living forms from outer space, most likely
And most frighteningly
Language itself was possibly given by these beings who communicate so highly

I'm a fucking monkey fucking monkeys and eating mushrooms
There's not much room for reality

Marijuana non alcoholic off all of it
Cannabis sativa rather
Maybe If eating her
After she's cooked in coconut oil and consumed
As a plant based macaroon
Hippy dippy shit
Shitty food isn't what I'm in to placing in my chemistry
Sorry if i seem rude
That's just how I view
This planet's plants
Are the way to advance
Way too advanced to understand
As the common man
Without directly speaking to your mother
You're just a stubborn child
Don't knock it till you try it
And blast off into the clouds of dust
In distant Nebulas
I promise you'll end up
Prophe-sizing just like me
Properly sizing up future history
It's already happened
Happenstance happens to be
Which dimension in which your standing
Step into the original frequency

Origin, home, ohm, singularity
God, doggone damn-it I can't
Write without enlightenment
Coming to mind
Thought Orgasm
Phantasm, ghosts come and go
Reincarnation more real that you know
I bet you Tibetan texts have most accurate explanation for what happens when bodies go vacant
