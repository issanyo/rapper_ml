[Verse 1: Cloud Envy]
First off
I wanna to start by
Saying the obvious
No more anonymous
Hashing out all
My problems taking it to
The drowning pit
Getting rid of the rats
Like Sinuse did Malkivich
Ironic how the quiet got the minds
Of the very talkative
With Life unfolds
Grabs hold takes control
Then it's case close
For the last 16 years I've been unimpressed
Maybe cause the fact I've had
A lot on my bench press
Went from idolize
To a life with odd and lies
Now my optics fly
Cause I'm third eye wise
It should come to no surprise
That I took a peace of mind
And made it mine
Now I flow with longevity
In a world that's unrefined
No more being depressed
I'm bout the happiest that I can be
This is just a groovy tune
Just to say that I am free
