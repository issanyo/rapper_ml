[Verse 1:]
Got me greedy as fuck, like my initials are I.R.S

Fuck you conscience I dare you to talk shit again

I'll pop you like balloon niggas taking supplements

I'll have your place next to fucking Kanye in the wet cement

Cut the flame on it cut the time by 10 percent

Let it fucking dry, watch Whitney cry

Because her high never came down

Looking like aborted fetuses in an ultrasound

What the Fuck you gone say now?

I don't give two fucks, yea Imma dip bitch

Gone with the wind like. skin cells to your leprosy

Got em' long faced like Triple H did the pedigree

Got em' roasted like the feels of fucking mustard gas. Instead of me

Maybe I'm in hell and I'm fucking Hitler's dad

Karmaloop

Shoot some bullets at me while I'm launching nukes

Look at these knees Not the bees I'll fucking  slaughter you

[Sample:]
Not the bees!

[Verse 2:]
Light a fire up my ass I'm the fucking wicker man

And another Burning man

So tell me who's greater than

I'm the known  El Capitan

Not a Murphy could be sicker then

Not even earth-bound

I'm the man behind the breeding ground

Dancing round shit. like I'm Mr. Six. and I invented sound

Causing riffs in time like Slash with eight arms and a couple mouths

Peep some rappers famous sucking dick like they need a crown

I go toe to toe disintegrate your face and run for more

Even Mj's nose knows when he prays for

Fuck the help not even death could fucking stop me

Got me burning senseis like a handful of wasabi

I'll make another fuckin storm like the Phoenix couldn't bother me
