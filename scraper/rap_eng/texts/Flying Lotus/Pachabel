[Verse 1]
I'm in the air again, you got a problem with the
Prototype model for rap? I'm takin' care of him
Pick him off the ground, shake a thug like a theremin
And let him wobble with the pitch, it ain't fair, my niche
Got your teddy bears hanging by the last stitch
They're mad switching and snappin' on their elastic
It rips every time that they tick
Flippin' switches to my sickness
I'm sippin' on cyanide, my visions have died
I'm just wishing for finer knives on Christmas
Can't you see that I'm singing my whole hit-list?
Da Vinci on the mic, with clues up in my fist grip
There's a whip on my hip and hips on my whip
If you trippin' on my dream then you're falling when I insist it
Call me Mr. Consistent, my vision is back
That's around when my visions attack
There's no way back from clappin'
Whether you're applauding or scrapping
Because any participation
Will have you caught up in my action
So just, give me an axe and five bottles of Jack
And I'm relaxin' old school, like an Anglo Saxon
I'm chaneling, from my basket to my casket
Some real acrobatics, on my certified magic
I'm so odd that it's tragic
I wouldn't be able to dodge the bullet
If you were pullin' your matches out
Cause ya'll know I need a fire to shout
Cause I'm a dragon
Drunk playin' Pachelbel's Canon in your house
While you tryna' hold a lighter to my snout
Move your fuckin' back, I pack a burner in the mouth
Kaboom! My sheer presence sets fire to the room
At night, my lonely eyes set fire to the moon
I walk the earth alone, past puttin' on cologne
Cause I'm tired, and no one's gettin' higher than my dialect
They're just gettin' hired to strangle
The sole proprietor of rhymin'
The present couldn't be a better timin'
For MC's to get mangled like tangled leaves
Please step up if you haven't crept up to me

[Outro]
This is the end of the road
There really isn't much else to do
Except give into your soul
This is the end of the street
There really isn't much else to do
So just give into the beat
