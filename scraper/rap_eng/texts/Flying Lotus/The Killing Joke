[Hook]
Mas tragam LÃºcifer pra mim
Em uma bandeja pra mim
Em uma bandeja pra mim
Em uma bandeja pra mim

[Verse 1: Captain Murphy]
It's too bad your favorite rappers ain't inspired
That's why a nigga came to light the fire
Now the game is on my Oscar-Mayer
I'm the nigga kids admire, labels trying to sign me
Speculating my identity, good luck you'll never find me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I live my life like I'm Bruce Wayne, in bittersweet pain
When you see what I've became, like a curse upon my name
Caught between the fear and guilt
Consequence of rising fame
I know the day my shit drops my life will never be the same

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, now the night calls me I feel the sky falling
The Dark Knight returns
I never wanted to rule the world
I only wanted to watch it burn
Y'all know how I do
I've got the last laugh or two
In that awkward moment when you see that I'm the Joker too
Underneath the chilling cloak, the killing joke
