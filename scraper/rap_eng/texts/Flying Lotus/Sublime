[Verse 1: D4T]
I'm out of school and every year feels like my senior year
These nerds be tripping over drama
I drop Osama bombs, brah
I'm a double entendre
Spit the gripes with life with dishonored stanzas
Spew spew spew spew llama
Don't stop til hot, that's Ghana
Equilibrium with my idioms
Happiness me give me some
Girl how am stressed when if I'm freaking young
Hakuna matata
I know that I am unstoppable
I don't mess with commas
And if I come off as mock-able
Well it's still the era!
I mean i am who i show you
I'm the black Benihanas
Don't seek to entertain
Same old braids and they all say "Happy Kwannza"
And screw a perm
Love the skin I'm in
But for how i prosper
All my Fizzites all-stars
And don't forget that we're also stronger

[HOOK]
I said id be home before night, that was the last time
But we know zombies come to life soon as the moon rise
I feel i incubate my mind under the sunlight
Then its is sublime is that a dang crime
NAH!
I live in sublime
Until the stars shine
I live in sublime
Until the stars shine

[Verse 2: D4T]
Everybody get up
Arms wide for those little dippers
Fill up all your red cups
Open wide to stretch your figures
With these sugar sweet rhymes
Ladies, you are now my strippers
1 ton Fizzites, screw a diet, cellulite delight
Whats next on the menu?
Mainstream rappers? Fits the appetite
And if your girl ain't acting right
Ill knock her lights, they call me Ike
She swears that she fell off her bike
D4T, til deafened mics
Sadistic pessimist of self existence since like fisher price!
Penny for my thoughts
Are all these fishes in my sea
Fluorescent weaves under these lights
How can make them fall asleep
How can get them in my Jeep
Oh geez my catch is never cheap
I wanna mack some Micky Ds
And smear their ketchup in the street
Penny for my thoughts
Are all these fishes in my sea
Fluorescent weaves under these lights
How I can make them fall asleep
(I gotta catch em all!) 4x
WHOOP WHOOP
No police or snitching narks here
The freaks come out at night
And out of sight, i come when its clear(whoop whoop)
Oh dear
Im always watching if the freaks near
Shes whoozy, im a doctor, and shes bout to get a paps smear
Sicker since I was a fetal
My Fizzites are never feeble
Im making the moves like Keeble
To drift away in a Beetle
With the spinny rims
The antonym of fitting in
Killin' with some vixens
Sippin' Lipton , im just chillin' aye
Im free-er than an eagle
My fun may be illegal
Im not living for the people
Make haters pause like cerebral
Palsy
These rats can't stop me
I make money
Saints stay hungry

Losers never live
Legends don't subside
Winners don't exist
Our fate leaves us at ties
The good ones always die
That's why i'm still alive

[HOOK]
I said id be home before night, that was the last time
But we know zombies come to life soon as the moon rise
I feel i incubate my mind under the sunlight
Then its is sublime is that a dang crime
NAH
I live in sublime
Until the stars shine
I live in sublime
Until the stars shine

And this is how swag fags act at night (4x)
