Whoh, I'm jacked off the joe
Packed a new Mack just to back off the foes
Finna casket the Mac verse
Some chaps raps make me laugh 'till my abs hurt
Facts first, it's the Screwface Cap, sir
Bad adverbs? You're leaving mass with a stabbed shirt
Act like you have worth, my cats catch cash pushing packs
Out the back of the Black church
Just to jack the White dude profit; priest takes a slice of the top plus
A chach sniff; Jakes too so the cops don't stop it
Making chops to your mom, pops, Doc and the locksmith
The flow s'posed to puzzle you
Wait right here, I'll be back like Flash with the muzzle glue
Drop a stack and we'll view what your mum'll do
The type of lewd acts you couldn't even mumble through

Dome's 5 o'clock
Dames ain't complain 'bout his aims or his size of --
Shoe, yo DOOM, pass the brews
Blast the boom bap and take a nap on the tube
Sipping sap in the booth like Tunechi
It's past noon, where the fume and the shrooms be?
Rapping over moon beats 'till the room bleeds blue
Running up your crew for boom sneaks and free food
To who you think the clues lead? I'm the soon-to-be dude
I'll drop the best news 'till spittoons leak
Luc's on a cheeky streak
If you can't handle the truth, you prolly shouldn't speak to me
Fuck molly, where the three litre beakers of ether be?
Me? I'm making naked queens outta Jesus freaks
Doll, please; I'm on that Rohld Dahl stee
After I fall balls-deep, don't call me

I'll call back like an interview if I'm into you
Roll back like spinners do and roll a couple pinners, boo
Get on your knees on the interstate
Trust, I'll return deeds with cunnilingus and a dinner plate
Running Mingus on her G-string; couldn't make a finger wait
What a great way to lift the inner mood
L-Spex: the next paradigm shift
Type to make "bare inside" parrot minds flip; Miller Light rhyming ferret-sized
While Fly Lo left plenty paralyzed following the snare-acide
Wallow on the terrace with a carrot-size pair of dimes? Verified
They're all glaring with the errand eyes
