Can't fall in love with these illusions
How you gonna survive with your mind polluted
Confusion , come fuck with the movement
The undisputed , live & direct
Came to collect , every ounce of respect
Until we resurrect (wake up)
Cause & effect
You causing corruption & interruptions
Cool , we don't follow instructions
Free the underground , Harriet Tubman
Writing more than Fredrick Douglas
While I'm cutting
Through the back field
Life is unreal
You can wait until a bag of chips is 2 dollars

Tryna have my whole hood pop collars
And have scholars
Free education without owing dollars
Safe parks for the toddlers
Growing up without fathers
But yall don't hear me tho
Your eyes stuck on TV & porno
Lost in images
This is for the tribes & villages
Where the surroundings is limited
They don't know about
Sleeping on the couch
Moving from house to house
Having plaque in your mouth
Turning socks inside - out
Didn't sleep in a few days
Bumping illmatic
Ignoring their fear tactics
Mos definitely feeling ecstatic
Super magic , slaying dragons
Who be bragging
About name brand clothes
Only a few people my color
Who own those
Bout to pick every bum
In the street
& having them Mobbin Deep with me
As I'm killing these beats
Survival of the fittest & they still here
Shut the fuck up , i care
We all deal with pain
Young boys selling candy on the train
Or be dancing for a meal
Well - least they don't have
Kill or steal but still
Can't say we free we
Get these shackles off your mind
They tryna tackle when we grind
I'm a philosopher
In disguise
Until we rise
