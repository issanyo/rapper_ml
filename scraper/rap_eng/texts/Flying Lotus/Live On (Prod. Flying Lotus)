I ain't bin being what I ought to
Eating morsels of a dam dorsal
feeling like I'm drowning with a snorkel
I'm just tryna Be immortal
Yeah
Well you ain't trying hard enough
Come with some harder stuff
You got the cheek to answer us
Had a chance but passed it up

Yeah
but I aint got the time
N you know its in my soul
I don't control my mind
Man got so many angles to shine
But the multiple focus ain't so bright
Only slight

Yeah
Look
All you gotta do is make a change
Get With the same
Follow the trends,
Copy the lens
Get the combo to that safe
Safe

Yeah
Mate
I been doing this for me
As u can see its personal
Who is this gon reach
And consumers only wanna dream
N I ain't gonna sleep
I got principles and honesty running on these beats
Fuck

Yeah
How can you expect to climb the steps to reach the top when you gotta switch flights,
Call that shit right at which height. N all that shit
Lifted up, Climbed to rise
why fall back
prick

Yeah
I'm hurrying with
The studying, but
I should a picked another thing Just summink that ain't so hard
I'm only in this hole
cos I was tryna be smart
My musics so I last

My G
You need to find a next scheme for getting that wet dream
Immortality may be what
Dem ones
who descend see
See, I think i made you smile,
Maybe you should just
Raise a child
Yeah

Wait
So Procreation
Is my closest chance
I could do Politics n business
Tony stark
You comical I wasted Way
Too many years to chuck away
True say
Its too late for me to pick another game

Naaw
You still got time
But only if you cut off this grind
N only stick to one line
When alls the critical kind
Do the shit that you like But validate
by Visualising into your literal life
Cos the thing you should mind
When inking dat slide
Is your picture ain't big
Its little n light
6 by 2 , 6 feet down
With a fictional crown
Yshould be satisfied with how
you stepped foot on these grounds

Fuck
Yeah I am
But man always dreams for more
I think we all got some ambition
Though you keep it low
I'm sad to see people grow
Into what I want for me, you know
Seems like
For happiness My hopes
and dreams just need to go
.....
You only got one life
Make sure you did
just what you wanted
