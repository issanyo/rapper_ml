[Verse]
When life gives you lemons
You hand em bitches out
To the sour mouthed
Salty niggas going through that drought
Cause I reign
Give what you can
I'm just a man
Still I'll provide you with the an-swer
Yes sir, I'm from BK myself
Well endowed in wisdom, but robbed by God in wealth
I swear
Why give me all this talent wasted
Asoh bittersweet that you made it
Yeah, and I ain't even make shit
The greatest hits youve never heard in the basement
Don't run past this base man
Get yourself tagged out if you running off your base man
(Tell David that's right)
Yeah, you're coordially invited
To my private island
Where the waves
Make the flow so cold in the winter
Ain't seen better days since I dropped that record in December
Made the city stop (ohhh)
Drop the beat
Roll up my sleeves
That kids on fire
Feel the heat
Peep the potential that he might reach
It sure ain't fair in height
He got degrees
Well technically, not yet at least
Still my pops on my line trynna check his seed
Like, I know ambition
I can't knock the vision, but no more Cs on that transcript please
And my sister's on hold preaching recipes
Praying on her last hope that she reaches me
Like baby boy lay off them trees
You buggin, we dont no addicts in the family
Just look at me, you know I ain't trynna stunt man
But two times three
Six figs off the jump man
Yeah, this could all be you
Just stay in school, I'll pull some strings
I've got the tools, please
Just remember that I love you
You, your siblings, and your makers
No one else above you
So, whatever you choose, you know I'll push you to success
I pray you do you
And do your best

And I've been kinda listening
But really I been bumping more common
And since I been rich in knowledge
Taking pennies for thoughts
'Til eventually I'm paid dollars for a dream that can't be bought
When life hands you lemons
You sell em bitches for a profit
Eyes on the prize, don't stop hustling until you got it
Get it?
Got it. Good looks, understood
Understand these other lemonade stands no chance
