It's superficial the way that you listen
Open your ears and your mind
Just take the time to
Look a bit deeper
You'd be surprised what you find inside
We're only human
That makes it simple
But all our lives are complex
And it's fine
It's fine

Can you read my mind
Or can you read my heart
Cause they're not one in the same
Your good intentions they're broken and beaten
Heaven and earth are all one in the same
