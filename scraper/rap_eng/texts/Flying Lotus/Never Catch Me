[Schama Noel]

Why are babies born, why do people die
Why do bees swarm, why do Eagles fly
And should I be happy to be alive
Could everything I know be a lie
Will I know all the truths via time
Will it reveal itself
Will I kill myself
Paralyze my body till I feel myself
Pair of lies, honesty's nowhere to be felt
Probably sitting on a dusted shelf
This power comes from God and nothing else
But lately I been ungrateful, these sins done made me unfaithful
Goodness gracious, look amazing but inside you're so unstable
Schama ima be honest, what's going on with your conscience
The blessings, you be dodging
Go conquer the land God promised
I'm haunted, I am demonic
I'm wrestling anacondas
My momma should've had birth control and a condom
I feel useless
My life is meaningless
It seems more and more, my life is meaning less
But I can't afford to abort, no I can't be depressed
Only worry bout myself nope I can't be the press
Always talking down on other people
Starting to think Mother Earth is mother evil
Where's the righteousness
Where's the monks, the enlightenment
Only punks, I don't like this band
At all, it's only raining cats, dogs
We stuck together catdog
Hug eachother for 2 seconds then I blow yo back off
Seems like this generation  are a bunch of degenerates on bath salts
Benevolence is irrelevant, it's best if you just back off
Malevolence is prevalent, the presidents does bad jobs
Its evident but at least he's better than the last one
I never win reality's prejudice its a referee with bad calls
I'm never seen with mask off
Cause you just gon stare inside my soul and be like "that's dark"
