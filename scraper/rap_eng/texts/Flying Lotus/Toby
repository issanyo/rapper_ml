Verse 1

Sick with the ink like a murder confession
Watch eyes start to dilate when i start flexing
Take a Big L to the face, no pun intended
My soul's ascended, my demons suspended
No comprehende, speak the language of kunta kente
So truth be told B, wouldn't give a shit if it was holy
Life ain't fair, in the end we all get kriss krossed
Pissed off, dissed off, flipped off like a discuss
That's the jazz melody to the streets, on repeat
For the feens on the path to meet ends meet
My team smiling like ceelo, leader of the negroes
All about that action like Steven Seagal
Above the law in tuxedos, that's an incognito
A bunch of guerrillas on path to be like the beatles
I rest my case your honor
In a room full of sinners, killers, where Emmett Till ponders

Check your souls before the crease, ain't no peace
Just angry branches that fell from the tree
Just a sad site, I'm glaring at parasites
Revolution ain't televised and you can feel the pain in these paragraphs
Insomniac nightmares, tryna change like cashiers
So a penny for your thoughts requires a dime for my lungs
