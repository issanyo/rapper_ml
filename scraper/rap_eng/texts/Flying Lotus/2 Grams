Smoke 2 grams
Up in 1 dutch
Never really needed much
Always had a special touch so they feel me
Im nice under pressure
Killing beats is just a guilty pleasure
Dont even put in full effort
I easily get it done
Flow like water
Once its on
I just let it run
Only right since I'm a track star
Listen to the proof , every track hard
Tell the D.j spin it like a frisbee
Let me see if they can catch it
White noise
Black magic
I'm in cognito
While everything thats fake is right in front ya face
But they blind tho
Ain't even in my scope because they micro
I dim the lights and shift my eyes low
Sticky green celery scented weed help me surrender to serenity
A member of eternity
Is what I will attempt to be
