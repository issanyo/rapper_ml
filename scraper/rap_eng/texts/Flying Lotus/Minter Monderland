I know what you going for
Please don't say rest to me
Tryna get the best of me
Best of the best homie
Plus it really make sense
I don't wanna make friends
I wanna create trends
High till the AM
Cause we love the fragrance
Months , Years , Days spent
Not up on occasion
But now I'm feeling caged in
Kinda like caveman
Lets a plan trip to Beijing
I know what they thinking
Feel what I'm super saiyan?
Bumping the chronic 
Like there should've been a chronical
Not funny but kinda comical
That would be kinda cool
Yeah...
But it's time to go
My flow is mechanical
My smoke is botanical
My life is a movie
In every fandango
My pops need the Phantom Rolls
My house needs the sandy toes
How far can he go
1 time for Santigold
1 time for Fran the nanny ho
How about my dick
For as far as panties go
Sick twisted mine 
Skips the line for the anecdote
That's what you call connects
Respects , all products tangible
In time we find our own grind ?
Before you get to chance to know
Life happens no time , show time
No man could do
I'm posing for the cameras too
Ain't that what we suposed to do
So instead of promoting you
They out here exposing you
Ain't no time catch up
Ain't no time to mess up
I never clean the mess up
What if I'm not next up
Even though they expect us
Like a check up
Like Sylvester
I'm still on
I write ILL poems
My real niggas
I still know em
Y'all tip towing
I'm exploding
I'm complete
Y'all still loading
I know what you going for
Please don't say rest to me
Tryna get the best of me
Best of the best homie
