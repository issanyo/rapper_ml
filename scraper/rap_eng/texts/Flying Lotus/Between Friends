[Verse 1: Teezy Kingz]

Hold up, Imma start spraying the whole block out, With a blunt in my hand, O.E. spilled on the ground, Found success in the bottom of a sticky jar, underage youth sneaking past the black shirts to go in bars, going very far, past mars she was scarred for life, uptown, downtown, it was only between her and her friend had a rough night past curfew they wasn't going in, They smelt the aroma from all the blunt smoking, Took a drag they were coughing started the calming, trying to find a way back home they solved it without a problem, got back to the crib on some other shit, No telling how they did, that's between them two they claim they best friends, I am like mayne I am fucking both of them (Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: Teezy Kingz]

Off a couple bottles she swallowed looking like a model, skin perfect with wavy curves, you know I am about get my swerve, smoke to release my nerves, writing down different words, repeat my shit in case I slurred, I am on the border of classy not swaggy pants sometimes baggy like the first two Carters, drinking purple like it water, Yeah you know this motherfucker is going very far

[Verse 3: Teezy Kingz]

Imma do this shit right I promise you, Don't take me as no fucking fool, student at the hardknock school, dove in a sprite yea I am really smooth I want to be a legend like Kool Moe dude, and Big Poe too Rest In Peace to D.J. Screw, it ain't a thang to do but bang the Wayne to keep me sane blow away the fucking pain, fucking a bitch to T-Pain, the one that really sangs, I bet by the end of the night we have hella bed stains, and she don't where the fuck she at, cuz she den lost her brain
