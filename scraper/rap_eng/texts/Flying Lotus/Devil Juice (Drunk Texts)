[Intro: Cass Hadley]

Pour the whiskey, Roll the L's
Drop the tabs, It's bout a bitch yo

[Verse 1: Cass Hadley]

Drowning in this devil juice
Pouring my heart out in a text
I never sent to you
That was prior to knowing everyone that you ever blew
Now I'm blowing smoke in a strangers face
And I'm spitting clue
Truth be told
I caught feelings, something like the flu
Got me coughing, Sneezing
Now I'm steezing off this strange brew
Another night on the roof
All conflicted
The sky is falling down
I think i wanna fall with it
Reach for the sun
And maybe try to dim it
Texting with this bitch
One more sip before i send it, Shit

Cause waking up alone is the hardest part
Going through her phone, that's where the problems start
We take the pain out of love
And we call it art
So this bitch must be the Basquiat of breaking hearts
Cause now she's got me forgetting how to spell and shit
It's like her wings fell
She done put me through some hell with this
A bad fish
So i go inhale the fifth
Not slitting wrists but I'm slipping words she'd rather miss
Miss, I don't really give a fuck
Said she needs to live it up
So i guess I'm walking dead, And
It's just another
Night on the roof, All conflicted
The sky is falling down i think i want to fall with it
Reach for the sun
And maybe try to dim it
Texting with this bitch
One more sip before i send it, Shit

[Outro: Cass Hadley]

Don't let me send it, Don't let me send it
Bruh you know I'm just way to fucked up to be thinking right now
And i might just fuck around and get my dick sucked on a cloud
