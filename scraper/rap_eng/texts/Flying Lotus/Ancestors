Ancestors take my hand
From transgressions greater than
How I've been acting, I'm so ashamed
I can't take the pressure, I own the blame
I'm caving in, I'm on my way

Ancestors take my hand
Cause I can't take the pressure, it's greater than
All my skin and flesh, I'm so ashamed
When I finally get there, will you know my name?
Feel like ice to the snow chain
Feel like my life with the price of fame

Ancestors coldest pain
And why am I on the coldest train?
To become a hot coal deep within the dirt
To become a charcoal that knew its worth
To become that diamond inside that church

Yeah, ancestors take out hands
