[Verse 1]

Dripping blood through the speaker.
Diligent through hardships autumn is the perfect teacher
Beyond decently expressing pilgrimage, deafs falling through the common procedure
Striving in a life of sin where Jesus couldn't hither.
So, please reconsider your opinion when I'm checking in the lifeless inn
Brawlin with leviathan
No Parkinson's he's eyein' easy targets in
Detonate before Galileo sentences bring the mental prisons in
The Cerebral requires adequate nutrition
Still a tad bit too prodigious
Head where the crown sits, and spits the verbal Auschwitz
Feel it in your heart throb
Stimulants feverish, get you closer to god everytime the head nod.
They said anxiety is the hand maiden of creativity
Stevie when they wonder
Look beneath the pigment and see the symmetry
Symmetrical self proclaimed prophecy's bullshits what they ought to be
My father is what my father should've thought to be
And, Honestly I don't think love has a color, or a gender
Scripted scriptures stroked in HD, and still couldn't receive the bigger picture
Scrutinize the oddities
Whatever, pot leafs finding serenity
Steam the quality broccoli
Til the Franklin's spire robust in quantity

[Verse 2]

Keep me at peace
Tried to give my brother felonies for doing the job of police
Bodybuildin' for his keep, move the product with the nina under the seat
I'm stabbin' stanzas with syringes and auctionin' off the heap
Never heard cancer speak, christened in influenza poetry
Flawlessly stitched with the embroidery
Starving artist regardless
Blinded cognizance? Jottin' verses in Onyx
Dread synoymous sentences opposite of nostalgic
Watermarked the documents
Underneath many influences
In the post meridian
Coliseum pits where they birthed em in
See the serpents
Youth got me waltzin' slow with Satan
Adam sinned I guess that's why my niggas die in the evenin
God loves mother's grieving. There has to be a different meaning
Lucifer's in all of us while we quote papers, and pray to the ceiling
Let the narcotics soon find sense in everything
Cut ties once I saw the difference between the dream chasers, and the dreaming
A Lone Ranger banging Tommy's at kemohsabee's, my neighbor probably gonna murder me
Behind the curtains where the convicts be
Victims of conflicts, where religious religions contradict
The rain won't let up, caught sunlight through it
Roses blossom after the harshest weather
Til' then dutches peelin' writing potent soliloquoy til' the hand looses feelin
Still searching for a meaning. (x3)
