[Verse 1: Niki Randa]

Little killer, hardly
Better days, I have seen them they leave, blew away
But there's a mark out on me
An arrow sent blades to defend his heart beating
Beat repeating
Embers of half sleep dream scape
The distance fades, I'm rearranging the game
Dont you want to play?
Heavy to move but slowly..
Burned in his gaze
A scarlet tongue and how it prays only to one shape..
The Kill
