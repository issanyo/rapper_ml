[Verse 1: $amael]
Sittin here sipping on this honest tea
I'm thinking ever since you left I been living life in a shell honestly
I have no affection for my peers all these people just seem fake to me
They all gettin fucked and poppin mollies
Just for the fuck of it
This bottle and this weed for me is just medicine
Life by itself I'm not too fond of it
Thats why I'm pourin up and takin bong rips
Dirty arizona and sprite to try and fix it
I know people who went by themselves and done quit
We're all sick
And thats the gist of it
Some might say I'm overly affectionate
But really I'm just maskin it
This pain inside of me
It'll make seamen queasy
And any normal person uneasy to be around me
Thats why I gotta cover it up
Get over it and fill up my cup
Of care its nothing but air
I'm apathetic
And some may be aware of it
And others may try and fix it
But its consuming me
All I want in this life is to be free
I'd travel the seas
And move to venus or mercury
It's hot up there
Hot enough to expand my thoughts and singe my hair
The pressure could kill me though
As well as the acid rain stead of snow
I'm on Pluto where I'm a popsicle
A double entendre cause its fucking possible
To be hard as ice when you're fairly nice
Life is a gamble a handful of dice and we chose to bet
That we'd live to see the end but we could die any minute

[Hook: $amael]
Bitch I'm apathetic
And y'all don't get it
Got problems wit anger management
Leave me in peace and apathy

[Verse 2: $amael]
Leave me in peace and apathy
Stay away till you're good
Then get back to me
Frontin like you give a shit
Come on then
Hit the lick
Robbing all them banks
While wily off the dank
Peyote on the bank
Piss me off you'll catch the shank
But catch me reading books like crank
I'm intelligent
But all my life I never gave a shit
Cause all my fears I conquered it
My life is a conquest bitch
Smoking on the loudest shit
Come round you might get hit
The smell so loud
Tweaking off that girl scout
Surprised the cops ain't found out
Look where this loud got us now
We in the air
Vibin' on the cloud
Driftin' on the 9
Gat in the closet fuck the store bruh I'll fucking rob it
And I'm fucking robin hood
Leaning on that good
I'll come round through your hood
With stacks cause I ain't a fucking crook
Bruhs pick up a fucking book
I'm done with this shit bruh fuck a look bruh I'm out
