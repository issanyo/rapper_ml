[Verse 1: HNTR]
This is for
The douche bags in snapbacks
This is for
All the little boys who can't rap.
I'mma run away
And when I make it back
I'll have a sick attack
Ready for you lab rats
(dog)
All you do is slack
(shit)
And I don't fuck with that
But you got me feeling
Like I'm coming out as boom-bat
And now they say the kid is bad
So I tell em
Put ya hand up
And catch the dap
(uh)
I'm ridin' out like ratatat
Jumping round in the back of the track
No lies dog, they just fact's

[Verse 2: HNTR]
But, you cats don't even see
Where my minds at
I'm getting hotter as the time pasts
And I'm running fast
I'm in fist place
And all the critics stuck in last
And when I win, I'll kick it back (man)
And i'll laugh
(HA YEAH)

And that shit's tight
Only looking straight but I've got my eyes
On the left and right
I'm feeling tight
I tell myself I could get it all
So I just might
(Man)
The only thing above me
Is these bright lights
