[Intro]
Yeah
Reminisce, reminisce
Uh huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
I'm praying for you even if you don't ask
Just in case the drank and the dank might be our last
And those times we laugh and smile become a thing of the past
I'd rather smell the flowers now before I'm under the grass
I know, We got a habit of holding onto those grudges
Emergency brake loving, some folks just ain't budging
For they kinfolk, Until they ride in that limo
Kind of parade that you don't wave out the window
That's a sad story, we never dreamed we make it past 40
Now that we pushing 30 living fast just ain't worth it
I'm trying to plant a seed and grow it on the richest surface
Have a child with my queen the closest thing to being perfect
Perhaps this verse is better suited for a song
But sometimes a hook can water down what's going on
And a freestyle will get the point across before too long
I pray my words chime like church bells when I'm gone
The lifestyle of rippin' and runnin' is cool for starters
I'm trying to live for now and still focus on tomorrow
Uplifting times of sorrow even if the time is borrowed
And be the kind of king like my father
All I ever wanted was to make my parents proud
Ever since I left the 'Sip and got my ass up off the couch
The road less traveled, but I wouldn't change the route
I put up with the bullshit to put on for the Sou'
A lesson learned, Cause shit get crazy when you're finally grown
Despite the silent nights, God never left me on my own, made me strong
Now I gotta big up my family big up my friends
So if these bigots belittle, we'll be bigger than them
I seen it though, clear as day
I get tired of leaving home, sometimes I'd rather stay
And kick it to my pops about the biz, parlay with my brothers and hang out with they kids
I hope they still remember who their uncle really is
I heard they're walking now, no more crawling in the crib
No more drinkin' bottles cause they askin' for a sip, I can't let ya
Thinkin' back when grandma used to give me all those lectures
Now that I'm older I can see from her perspective
That money don't buy love, happiness, or Heaven, blessings
I hope my tone convey that I'm serious and that you feel it
If these my last words, may they be more than lyrics, Krizzle

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God (Krizzle)
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
