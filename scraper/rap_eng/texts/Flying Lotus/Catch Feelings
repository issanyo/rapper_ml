[Intro]
You ever had to make those small decisions
In life were, you think that you're like dope as fuck
But you're really not, you're just lyrical, fuck

[Josh Wright]
Skipping over rocks, but I'm tripping over paper
That hooker that we did, now everybody hates us
We tripping through the wire, just for you to come and play us
No high fives (bye), cause, I"ma reflection through the mirrors edge
I don't condone with stupid heads, their all kinda bogus
I'm overflowing on this Flying Lotus, and you're girl wants a beat
So I gave her the salami, with a side of balls, the finest beef
Listen to this jonwayne flow, keeps you on an anity, the golden child
When I smile, I'm the family, I hate jealous pretenders, I'm in some fly suspenders
To keep you blended like the weed senders, plus, I'm overdose, or is it, over grown
I haven't even transcended, plus, my flow is over grown, shakespeare with the pen
This is the realest shit I ever wrote, ever spoke, Martin Luther King as the head pope
I'm even trying to leave you padless, I might never be discovered like atlantis, but
I'm telling you, I'm writing my new plans out like an atlas, keep me bagged, cause
You'll never get bad kid


(Hook)

If it was up to me, I'd set you free, I'd set you free, mentally
But it's funny how things change
When you want life to stay the same
When you start to catch feelings too
You just don't know what to do


(Verse)

I'm a beast in control
They blowin' more than smoke, I get the trees for these hoes
And they wonder I cry, sweat, and bleed in these shows
It's because I put a hunnid in, I do this for my brothers and--
My mother and my father and my grandma and my lover then--
Smoke til I'm dumber and, I'm focused on the summer man
I'm beatin on this pussy like a muthafuckin' drummer man
My flow is like a Pedigree and a Stone Cold Stunner man
Like the Undertaker, I'ma take ya soul
Rest in Peace to Macho, he's the one that let me know
That life is gonna be full of "I-told-you-so's"
But don't worry son I'ma fuck these hoes'--
Mindset-- I bet you thought I meant with the sex
These girls is still tryna get at me, I'm deletin' they texts
I got a album coming y'all ain't gonna know what's next
They expect nothing less than the best from the BEST


(Hook)

If it was up to me, I'd set you free, I'd set you free, mentally
But it's funny how things change
When you want life to stay the same
When you start to catch feelings too
You just dont know what to do
