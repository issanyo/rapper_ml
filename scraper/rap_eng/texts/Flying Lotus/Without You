Endless nights I spend
Trying to figure out
How to live without you

And though easier it seems it is
Never should have chanced at this
How was it a hit and miss
We'll never know
It's time to go
Closing time at two
Don't know what to do
I can't get you off my mind
And so baby just a drink or two
The more I sit and think of it
Another drink and it'll slip
From the mind
Please pour the wine

Now that it's past two
Took off both my shoes
I don't really care at all
Because I don't really have a choice
You know we both chose our paths
Now it's got to stick and last
For the time
I paid the price
Lonely nights I spend
Trying to make sense
I'm just tired of it all
But still it's always gonna be my fault
You and me
We're meant to be
And it's okay
