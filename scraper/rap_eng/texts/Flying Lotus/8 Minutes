[Intro: J4yDiZz1e]

May's Depression, 2016


[Verse 1: J4yDiZz1e]

8 Minutes of Rapping, 3 Hours of Trapping, 11 Days of the same ol' story nigga we blacking

Now I walk across the street of the same ol' world that we live in my flow is as cold as oceans yeah I'm talking bout pacific

Or maybe even the arctic now can we please get along, When I get up on beats I'm always seeking a difference in song

I write my words on a page, you write your words hella wrong, I'm doing this for the fam, And I'm doing this shit too long


[Verse 2: RaiThaGe]

Nigga you try painting pictures, Fleeked as fuck hit up them swishers, Why is it me who is dealing out all the helpful scriptures

No one will ever recognize the shit that I do for artists, I'm starting a new type of flow to unlock it is the largest

Man I think I am a man, not just a man, I am the man, I'm fighting for the reality of everybody with bands

8 Minutes for the come up, watch me run up, while I'm on them Xans, I am RaiThaGe, no longer Ge I am a god now


[Verse 3: J4yDiZz1e]

Is it something I am doing to make these niggas so salty, I work my ass off for Grams, I'm Drizzy just call me Aubrey

I want a gun to my head, then BOW BOW it's activating
My mind I lost I can not find so I stay contemplating

These words that I speak are fading they came from the soul, I remember getting jumped by niggas at seven years old and no one knows

Living life the way I have so far that's pretty bold, Wanting lights all in your face like this go climb the social pole


[Verse 4: RaiThaGe]

Lights, Camera, Action, lets make a movie though, your bitch is wet down to her feet from me man you already know

Niggas always yapping, I stay trapping in the hood Mo, Sell a dime bag of that gas call it "Money Grow"

Doesn't matter what you do or say nigga you still hoe, Always stay up high up in the sky always need that blow

I hate rappers personally but I still need all that dough, And to think I started out this verse with though, God I can flow


[Verse 5: J4yDiZz1e]

Beyblade, Let it rip open and cut you violently, Tired of fighting Niggas I spit, and they sit silently

Quietly assassinating all you niggas mildly, the words that I talk are godly, Get it cause I

Leave you niggas all behind and all you niggas in the dark, then I take this piece and make like Vegeta "Tear you apart"

Fuck your other problems nigga I'm the one you do not want, I don't fuck with all these hoes give them riches and they will flaunt

[Verse 6: RaiThaGe]

Never give them riches though, I'm to fucking handsome, Me and squad taking the game for Ransom, I want Ten K and some

More so I can get up on my fandom, I stop crime in the rap game on TV I'm like Chris Hanson

Niggas now a days know they love the sound of RaiThaGe, I am me and no one can ever take that away from me

I stay fucking bitches all day in my one seater jeep, But sex will never run my life if I need it I get only
