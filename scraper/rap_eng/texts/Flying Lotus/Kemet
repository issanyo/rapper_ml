I think I remember what I did in my
Past life
So let's take a fast ride
Rewind take a trip to the Nile
A young prince Nefertiti looking
Checking my style
But I'm focused on the betterment
Shinning light Thomas Edison
What they injecting into your
Consciousness could be venison
And leave us dead again
You really think they even care
Only nation has to pay for health and
I swear it's getting worse
But hopefully I' m pealing the veil to
You in verses
Service to humanity
These ramblings can save you dog
They try to replace you dog
Want to chip us all and enslave you dog
Don't make it easy
See perfection on the TV
If you would hit the switch
Turn it off, see what we see
3-D what you settle with relative to
Your regiment
We tattle telling it see I calm them down
With my excellence
So you better get
Ready for the movement
It's the revolution
Me and you
Executing

So who gone step up on the battle line
Throwing fire darts at these heathens
Man these battle rhymes
Saddle ride
Use me as your paddle guide
It's cool with me
It's getting real like Laguna Beach
I guess we on the come up
We want it upfront
It's easy
Please believe me when I tell you I'm
From Kemet
Wish that I can go back to the
Pyraminds where it's at
No payment for the medicine
Imhotep handles that
So we living it to the fullest relaxing
And kicking back
It's crazy how we figured this
For you it's just a hit or miss
Luckily the alchemist exists
Second guess the syllabus is it
Relevant to your niche
The time will only tick
If you focus on getting rich
The passion in you will fade away
If you let it
We stay hermetic
Divinity in our genetics present
No pass no future
Do what suits ya
Prana boost up
Whoossa
I'm calmer now
Two years ago a problem child
I'm drinking water now
I'm doing better while you looking down
Jealousy the ugliest trait
Why you wanna hate
Not saying I'm a saint
We the same
If you get the aim
(yeah)
