Heartbreaks, setbacks, breakups, makeups
Love, love, love, love, love
Breakdowns, buildups, knock downs, broke down
But still try,try,try

Baby, this could be a change for us to see
Maybe, we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we find the truth there's something we should do
Can't let the love stop flowing from me to you

You know we tried way too hard to find
A love that's really blind so why even try
Because we know that there's still hope
Just don't let go

Baby, this could be a chance for us to see
Maybe, we'll figure out where we're supposed to be
Until we found the truth there's something we should do
Can't let the love stop flowing from me to you
