[Chorus:]
Suddenly you came on to me
Was it wrong for you to belong to me?
Maybe we can find a way
Everyday is like a dream to me

[Verse 1:]
You said I need a place to go
So we said lets go
I let you out of my sight
But you were stir-crazy
Looking for the next best thing
To fight is your escape route, and so is mine
It was the best thing for you and me to unite
No matter where we go the winds still blow
Cause matters of the heart always lead you from the start

[Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Another day, another show
And the wind just blows, In and out of my life
You think I'm crazy cause all I want to do is relive the day that I first met you
Was right on time, It was a bright day and you were like a heavenly sign
At the end of our tale, the loneliness prevails

[Instrumental]

[Chorus:]

[Outro:]
Its way easy for you and me, love
It can't hold on, just be who you are
