Sometimes it's hard to think straight
When there is just so much
Crowding your space
You've got to drown everything out
And see what you want to see
Listen with your heart and see through all of your fears
Open up your world
That's just yours cause life just seems so short
But if you play the game you can win in the end

Heart begins to race
Hands begin to sweat
On the edge of death
If you lose you have to play again

Life's a special stage
Zone in on your goal
Sit back and relax
Play the game and play to win
Doo wah doo wah doo wah doo wah

If you miss the point
You must understand
Life is just a game
It's all in your hands
Doo wah doo wah doo wah doo wah
It's all in your hands
