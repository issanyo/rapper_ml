[Verse 1]
I'll be, knockin' up at yo door
(Whose there?)
How to get in them drawers, girl you should let me know
Cause your body so exotic you think its a kind of dope
You be sort of like a bottle, be calling that girl a coke
But ever since I've met you I've been intensing my dough
I didn't wanna say this but damn its Murder she wrote
And everything was lies except for the thighs and throat so she took a nigga's money and soul and left a note
(Fuck is up?)
Damn, feeling like I'm a victim, but that's just how it be my nigga fucking with bitches
And is it really me and do she really want riches, I gave her all my time and she didn't pay for the minutes
Baby, I don't know what you want from me, I just want you to make this love with me
Fuck all that future talk and all the marriages, it's my swag ho and that's just how I carry it
So bury all those thought about the Marriott, cause you far from that chick whose about to get the rock
You ain't fooling nobody wearing KiSS no more, you ain't getting no money from this nigga girl
I say good bye everything thing pimping boy, now when I fuck women I don't get annoyed
Girl say she want some money but shes not employed, im the pimping source, preHISTORIC boy

[Hook]
Hot sex, you’ll find it on the street, right under someone’s skirt
I'll front a bar; that’s free
He wears a purple suit, his seatless full of stag
His hair is permed out, his hands are full of franks

[Verse 2]
Pshhh, cause he got plenty of bitches
But sometimes I wish I could convert them all to wishes
I already know how cook and do all my dishes
So (so-so-so) what is im getting?
What pussy? Well, niggas been hittin
You just got your girl so shut up nigga and listen
Since jordan had his tongue out, these bitches been hoes and tricks
Just a few good ones but I can't find them
I got a baby who I don't even fuckin' want
I;m watching everything fall in December like its Autumn
And the sad part about is that you treat it likes its modern
And MTV need to change its fucking accomplishments
But anyways I was posted on the downer with a bad ass bitch handling a bonus
She makes a lot of money til the feds run up on us
At least im real, you should call me Toto
You're crazy for the ring, you should call him Frodo
You ass must be high like the women in a go-go
Small minded women end up like Juno
Not ready for the world? Nigga what do you know!

I swear I'm trying to love you, and I really need you
But it didn't matter and i'mma ask a pimp
I miss that life, but fuck that shit
Fly-Lo, Ph in this bitch, BITCH!

[Hook 2x]
