[Chorus: Busdriver]
Your god is from the underground
So when you pray, you can now fuck around
No one will ever save you
Once your dead, then your dead
There is no coming back
Your god is from the underground
So when you pray, you can now fuck around
No one will ever save you
Once your dead, then your dead
There is no coming back

[Verse 1: Busdriver]
News flash!
The world cracks wide the fuck open
Swallowing you and your homies whole
Whole notes, holistic remedies, the whole kit and kaboodle
It is holier than thou
Digested by the earth, I've been jailed in the essence
Bewitched, imprisoned, disappear in the black expanse

[Chorus]
Your god is from the underground
So when you pray, you can now fuck around
No one will ever save you
Once your dead, then your dead
There is no coming back
Your god is from the underground
So when you pray, you can now fuck around
No one will ever save you
Once your dead, then your dead
There is no coming back

[Verse 2]
Grounded, yeah Iâ€™ve been grounded
Angelic limbs in flight taxidermied into coat hangers
My son asked me if we would live
My son truthfully asked me if we would live
Carbonite breakfast cereals with a cyanide taste profile
Leaving little room for imagination
Either that or nothing but room for imagination
Come to the temple of the intergalactic high command
To distract from your tomb, to distract from your tomb
Awash in afterworld reasoning and hood magic, made into metaphysics
Comb-straight, as streets crumble and bones break
As streets crumble and bones break
It's mixing ash with blood, as the hell is normalized
Welcome to Los Angeles, motherfucker!

[Chorus]
Your god is from the underground
So when you pray, you can now fuck around
No one will ever save you
Once your dead, then your dead
There is no coming back
