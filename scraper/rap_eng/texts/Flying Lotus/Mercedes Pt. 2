[Verse 1:Tech$ Finesse]
Mercedes
I wrote this song for you
Baby it's mine I don't got to sign at the dotted line
If time is money than you niggas running out of time
Like Jack Bauer you know my wheels is 24 Doors go up when I open up the door
Looking at this cold world and people telling me that it's yours
Remembering when used to get high and write rhymes in my room instead of doing my chores But look at how much that helped me
I'm rapping fucking bitches
Plus I'm wealthy
But that's just a fantasy
After reading half y'all shit i don't feel bad for writing mine so here goes
Perfect ain't really perfect
Unless its perfection
Living life in the present
My past is what I'm regretting
Teachers ain't prepare him for this lesson
So now I'm regretting
Everything i did every way I lived
I'm a sinner to the D-e-a-t-h
How we used to live
Everything I did learned all that as a kid
Shut his eyelids
Inspired smoking weed getting higher
Now I'm on fire like Steve Maguire
Higher Higher
Man on fire

[Verse 2:Tech$ Finesse]
Alot of people got bars but be afraid to reach the stars
Fuck driving fast cars and bad broads
Listen to the message
Some of this knowledge now a days
Will lead you in the wrong direction
That's why I question everything
Wisdom and knowledge is everything
Right now im thinking like fuck everything
Like
The bling, The bling
The Sing The sing
The Wedding rings
I wanna marry you girl
I wanna do everything wit' you
Hallucination or losing patience
Gonna end up as a patient, but what they gonna pay it with?
