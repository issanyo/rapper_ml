On our way home,
We spoke of many things...
"Are we allowed to make
brand new beginnings?
Do we need to know
where the journey stops?"
On my way home,
cleaner all the lights.

On my way home,
I thought of many things....
"Are we allowed to make
brand new beginnings?
When we want to move,
who pulls the strings?"
On my way home,
I thought of many things.

i dream of roses,
i dream of trees...
i dream of roses,
i dream of trees...
i feel the sun...
on our way home...
i thought of many things...
on our way home.
Do we need to move?
