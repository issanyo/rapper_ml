I close up all my problems, never open to revisit
Or maybe solve with that ol' visa dusting up in these ol' keepers
Doing work offshore is crucial to make some room for your inclusion
Busting asses for some fusion and my reclusion turn into amusion
The dream is there to follow but am I ready to be hollow
Two years pass on artist that last no fierce like the great ol' dear rap sorrow
Narrowing my way to success, synonymous with the best, never here to throw a fest, always here to impress
I can never pick out the difference between 2 sides and ISIS, I ask myself why is this, cowards throwing lies at this
Coupons and buy this, difference is that this, thing we call life, separates us throw night wishes
Do it or you don't, no middle ground, just a front, high ground and centre or falling off a cliff want
Different compared a woah, to something like uzi hoe, selling verses Jay-Z, watch me work it JT
Shout out, but never switching topics out loud, we still got a Manchester bombing to go around
How come 5000 die in Middle East, no prayers for this and peace, but all the best for some anorexic ''mass'' disease
Infuriated cause humanity fucks up all it's sanity, each day that passess like a fucking try-kill ceremony
Fuck it I've lost the hope, finna go throw it all, kill yourselves all you want, I don't care no more, that's one more
