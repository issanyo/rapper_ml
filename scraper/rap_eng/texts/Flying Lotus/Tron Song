Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going

I always come back to you
Don't you worry about me

Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going

I always come back to you
Don't you worry about me

Don't you know you rock my world?
Don't you ever leave me Turbo Tron
Don't ever wonder where I'm going
