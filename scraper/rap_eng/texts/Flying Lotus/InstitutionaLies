[Verse]

Time to start a revolution
Wipe the slate clean, erase every institution
What gon kill me first? Pollution or a shooting?
Probably get popped off by the big man who's ruling
There are signs in the music
People must wake up and open ears to the movement
Can't trust the news cuz they disguise the truth
Felt like a zoo at school, I'd rather be in a booth boozin'
So you can catch me in the future
Ridin' in a four door delorean that be cruisin'
Don't get too relaxed, question all the facts or ancient artifacts
Ask yourself, who really got your back?
Cuz Imma have a blast before I fade to black
Trapping with the pack and saving stacks
And have a plan of attack for anyone who tryna squander that
Cuz I ain't fine with that
Now y'all wishing we had Michael back...
You never really know what you got till it's gone
Or if you gonna end up old and alone
We all lost souls just tryna find our way home
Feel like E.T. with no fuckin' phone!
Starting to feel the distance
Starting to get pissed man
Like where my independence?
Nowadays it's a mission to find the best misses
Fuck what color her skin is
Repressed memories are so mystic
After a loss it's hard to be optimistic
Depressed with no prescription
I standout with my neck out, waiting for competition
Breaking pencil leads, writing compositions
In a world so vicious with girls who simplistic
Only thing I got is my vision!
With motive to keep speaking and maybe y'all will listen
Ahead of my time, I might have to give it a minute
Dangerous money
Cuz it go so well with women, diamonds and sinnin'
But, I want all that!
I hate to admit it!
I hate to be skittish!
I hate to begin and not finish, but they watching...
