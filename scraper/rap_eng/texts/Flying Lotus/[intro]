[Verse 1:]
Hodgy told the lil homie he was gon' spaz on that
Now I'm here for round two, busting ass on that
Senior year, '14 head of class in fact
I rep the college kids too, keep it all compact
I might be coming from another time
Cause when you hear my voice my age stays undefined
It's under wraps like crooked cops and organized crime
My goal is trapping all the wack niggas with every rhyme, until they out of time
And the mainstream celebrate legends of rap with every track in the cassette getting played back
Until the tape snaps leaving y'all with heart attacks
Arrested cardiacs take you away and pull you right back
If that's over your head, I'll acknowledge that like good quarterbacks and make adjustments on my next track
I'll toss a lyric wherever you trynna leave it at, master it too, send it off, bet it go platinum fast
These are more than aspirations, I'm flirting with destiny, to my fam y'all gotta stay patient
Cause right now all the debating and making statement is not helping my patience plus these people are annotating
My actions every day, so if I fly off the handle and let my words spray
It better be at a rapper who tryna get paid
Not at my niggas or over stuff that happens every day, y'all better hit the hay
These people love to overstay their welcome
You give an inch and lose a mile when you try to help 'em
They wanna listen to the lies the media tell 'em
Then get surprised when we gone and the blade impales 'em
Don't let it get you down though, your life is profound so
Keep repping ya town for the eventual crown and people getting down to your flow
I'mma do this until I feel my heart stop the flow
[Gunshot, body falling to the floor]
