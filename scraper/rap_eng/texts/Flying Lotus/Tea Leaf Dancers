[Verse 1: Andreya Triana]
No, I can't seem to get it
And in my mind I'm bettin'
My time's made up, I gotta' go
And it's alright if you want
To see through your tomorrow
But right, now I gotta' go

[Hook]
If you want to stay then you can be here with me
But I can't let go of all this love, oh no, so easily
I said, if you want to stay then you can be here with me
But I can't let go of all this love, oh no, so easily

[Verse 2]
No I can't seem to forget
And in my mind it's steady
My times made up, but I'm at home
And it's alright if you want
To be who you want to be
But right now, I gotta' go

[Hook]

If you want to go babe, you can...
But hear me out...
Oh, I can't let it go, oh so easily
So easily
So easily

No, No, No...
If you want
If you want
So easily...
Its alright...
Believe me it's alright...
