[Intro: Zilla]

Franco you in the big leagues now
Hope your bars is up

[Verse 1: Zilla]
June.you.are got you on a track with real lyricist
Spittin with the spirit so vicious Biggie is hearing this
And noddin' his head bumpin'
Right next to Pac thuggin'
And throwing up Westside yelling "Zilla that boy Something"
Its nothing though it really comes naturally
All these demons after me
Damn another casualty
Got me questioning why I sold my soul in the first place
Hell was my birthplace
Explains why I'm always fucking heated
But I'm changing the subject
Rappings my passion I love it
Sometimes I wanna say fuck it
Man what if nothing comes from it
Will I still love it or will I fucking hate it
Life its hard to face it
But your dreams you gotta chase it
Even if you're rapist
I don't judge
In a cypher I won't budge
I be killin' shit with ease
I got bars nigga please
Got these bitches on they knees
Take a hit up off the trees
Rest in peace Capital Steez
I don't make music I let you live through my life through words
Its to much success to attain to be scurred
So I ain't never scared like Bone Crusher
Calling more bluffs than fucking phone numbers
Try to call mine and get the fucking wrong number
Boy I'm the shit, you're gonna need a strong plumber

[Verse 2: june.you.are]
Yeah this is for a summer
Callin' out all bitch niggas in slumber
Zilla and June Toon its like they all wanna
Claim lyricism's dead
I'm a mutant spliff, I'm coming for your head
No more rap songs, figured ya'll support what I said
Just Hip-Hop ya flip flop, flip a burger instead
I'm underground, the sound brown skin I'm all in
Bet ya chips I'm tossin'
I'm flossin'
No gloss on my flaws all win
Always no days off
Claim they cotton real shit, so soft
I claim to pickin' cotton
Slave shit
Save shit before the Boro boys call your bluff out
Bet I smoke a whole blunt before you cough out
The truth
They can't prove what they sayin'
In the booth I be sprayin'
Venom
Pop Advil two Excedrin
Mad skill never questioned
Blessing in disguise
Birthday surprise, never saw it coming
Your mother I smother, another victim I just cum in
Side pride fuck that I rather serve peace
Deceased souls I preach to
I teach too
They wanted more bars so I gave em' the sequel
Tryna taste stars, I'm in awe
I'm in all of your headphones now
Thinking damn I used to be a fucking let down now
I've got a buzz, and they want some of the pollen
Watch a nigga blossom
