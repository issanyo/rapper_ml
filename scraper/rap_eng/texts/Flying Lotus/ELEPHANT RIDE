Elephant Ride

Written by D Prosper

(D. Prosper Music- ASCAP)

Guess who's Bizzack?

It’s Prosper, the field share cropper on the rap
The A&R, behind the scene pick the tracks
Put my work in everything turnt Plat.

Harriet Tubman free ‘em from the traps
Hocus Pocus their magic is bogus
Two Thousand Twelve A.D
Keep focused

Broke the spell
Rebel! This is dopeness
Sucker emcees put them on notice
We gon rock all night
Cause we take no breaks like them fixed gear bikes
Use these words as weaponry
No trial!
Detain the US citizen indefinitely
Fight for freedom especially
Kill' em slowly
You know me!
Protest SOPA, NDAA
Yhea that bigger shit!!
Now tell me why that magazine called Rihanna a “Nigga Bitch”?

Whatcha say mama?
Ok ok a nigga step up
Catch the ambulance ride
Rapper test me
Catch an ambulance ride
Tell him with Pros he don’t wanna collide
I stomp that ass out on an elephant ride...

Oh there I go, Oh there I go
Sipping Merlot
Virgo cusp of Leo

Hot like Geo Thermal
That Dante Inferno
You know Prosper got more lines than Kum Kau on Myrtle
Use to be my homie
Used to be the ace
Now I spit fire and saliva to the face

What she saying is
Around here, nigga
You can disappear really no trace
Sacred music! Ganawa!
The city of the Fez
Poetry like its Sonia Sanchez
That Rakim Allah
If you really know the ledge
What you mean?
Youth on lean and all types of meds
This type of shit put bullets to the heads
The humming coming at cha
12 tribes in Africa
The take over
Like the prisoners in Attica
Prosper the top spitta
Plus he got more styles than your Urban Outfitters
So....
Welcome to the saga
Shafiq Husayn thinks she's saying
Prosper the Firestarter

Whatcha sayin’ mama?
Ok ok a nigga step up
Catch an ambulance ride
Rapper test me
Catch an ambulance ride
Tell him with Pros they don’t wanna collide
Stomp that ass out on my elephant ride
