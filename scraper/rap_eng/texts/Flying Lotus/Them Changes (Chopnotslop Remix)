[Verse 1: Thundercat]
Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
A-and I can't find my-my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning in a pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, no-nobody move

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Thundercat]
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (a-ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
Been traveling-been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where-where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heart-heartless, broken mess

[Outro]

[OG Ron C]
Yeah
What you sippin' on G?
What's that in your glass baby?
Huh?
What you drinking on?
What?
You know what we drinking on in this [?]
All over the world, [?] what they drinking on?
Shiii
Let's go
