(feat. Hi-C)

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I've been slangin' for too long
See this block is my home
When these rocks are all gone
I'm a
(Get that brick!)
We up in the zone
I'm a get the hood strong
Got a pocket full of stones
We 'gon
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)

[Verse 1: Hi-C, Young Buck]
I'm on the block with some rocks and some Teneta Scales
Got a Glock for the cops I ain't goin' to jail
OGs told me "Hi-C, we livin' in hell"
Don't ask a nigga for shit homie, just get it yourself
I took a gram, and flipped it to an eight ball
A week later got an ounce now i'm straight ya'll
My first ounce, I broke it down to dime rocks
I bought a quarter ounce of weed and a nine Glock
[Young Buck:]
Break a bird down to dime rocks
When the projects hot stash mine in a shoe box
Got some bread knots
Copped a red drop
Mama said "stop"
Papa sell rocks...
To the whole fuckin' family

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I've been slangin' for too long
See this block is my home
When these rocks are all gone
I'm a
(Get that brick!)
We up in the zone
I'm a get the hood strong
Got a pocket full of stones
We 'gon
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)

[Verse 3: Hi-C, Young Buck]
[Hi-C:]
Homeboy did life, he was runnin' his mouth
He had the pounds in the hood I put the gun in his mouth
[Young Buck:]
All the birds fly South, roll or get rolled over
We got it for the low and we cook with no soda
[Hi-C:]
My fans 'gon roll
Niggas on the come up like Lambo doors
[Young Buck:]
We can't buy grams no mo'
A quarter 'll cost you fo'
If my bank roll low
I'm a go and get dough
[Hi-C:]
Before you cats pullin' hoes
Grabbin' at you you got to go
Seventeen for the hoes
[Young Buck:]
Come and get it and go
If you get caught with it its yours
Nigga snitched on me before
Then he won't snitch no more

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I've been slangin' for too long
See this block is my home
When these rocks are all gone
I'm a
(Get that brick!)
We up in the zone
I'm a get the hood strong
Got a pocket full of stones
We 'gon
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
Go sell the dope
And
(Get that brick!)
