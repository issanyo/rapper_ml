[Intro]
Nobody 'gon help nobody out here

[Hook]
Doing with the dope money
I refuse to have no money
In the trap but this ain't no place for me
Everything 'bout money, nothing free
If I didn't have to...
I gotta deal with dope money
I refuse to have no money
In the trap but this ain't no place for me
Everything 'bout money, nothing free
If I didn't have to...
This ain't no place for me

[Verse 1]
Locked down, bitch I'm stuck in the city
They running 'round town, hollering "Buck in the city"
Yes, bricks in the hood but ain't enough in the city
Me and my niggas eating good 'till the government get me
100 pounds in the rental, 1000 pills in my pocket
And yea since I got it put my young hoes through college
It took the long time so I'm thinking long term
Dip the swisher in the lean and let it slow burn
Been balling, now I tell my niggas "Man it's your turn"
To serve these fiends 'till they nose burn
These niggas scared to look but their hoes turn
So they sending their bitches to buy theirs o's for 'em
Still strapped in this bitch on probation and all
My daughter wants them Jordans so I'm braking the law
I've got birds, ounces, quarters, and even bundles of raw
I'm out here hustling like I've got nothing at all

[Hook]
Doing with the dope money
I refuse to have no money
In the trap but this ain't no place for me
Everything 'bout money, nothing free
If I didn't have to...
I gotta deal with dope money
I refuse to have no money
In the trap but this ain't no place for me
Everything 'bout money, nothing free
If I didn't have to...
This ain't no place for me

[Verse 2]
They raided me and we 'gon shoot it out
I would die 'bout the this shit, what is you 'bout?
In the trap with the TV off but the cameras on
Junkies knocking on a door wondering if I'm home
Niggas acting surprised, they thought I left it alone
Them other niggas falling off but I kept it on
White boy drugs, methadone
I got 'em popping bars 'till they head is gone
I think bitch, she be fucking with them tabs too
She bought valiums but she gotta have blue
I'm leaning on the leather
Bitch, I'm doing better
Me and quan count money itching on the yellow
My PO trying slow me down but I never let her
She popping up whatever but I never sweater
'Lil bitch, I'm on a whole other level
The all gold Rolly with the presidential bezel
It's Buck!

In the trap but this ain't no place for me
Everything 'bout money, nothing free
If I didn't have to...
This ain't no place for me
