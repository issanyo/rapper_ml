(Young Buck Talking)
If i should die before i wake
Lord Please my soul you'll take
Eh eh pass that blunt
Man i ain't even asked for this shit
Man this the realest shit i ever wrote though
But you know, i guess im thuggin it up

(Verse 1)
There's no way i can hide it, you can see the pain in my eyes
I ain't thinkin' 'bout college, too busy tryin' to stay alive
They done cut the water off and I ain't tryin' to see the lights go
Even little shit like 5 dollars I'ma fight fo'
My sister's only twelve and she's pregnant with a baby
My brother's goin' to jail and my mama's goin' crazy
I'm all by my self, mutha fuck my old lady
Cause soon the money left, she was fuckin' niggas daily
We already in hell Lord please can you save me
I'm ridin' with a 12 gauge i know these niggas hate me
I got a few birds and a few words for you niggas on the street
I'm swervin' in excursions I know you heard of me
I got them mad at me, I hit the block cop drop that nigga bad ain't he
We sell rocks, bust Glocks and keep our rags hangin'
Thug Niggas shootin at cops, Look we ain't playin'
Anywhere sittin up shops

(Chorus x2)
I wonder if i died and came back
Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like i was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that
I knooowwwww

(Verse 2)
You got me ain't havin bitches in the hood
Theres snitches in the hood
My suggestion to you niggas start gettin it while it's good
If you crawl fore your ball, learn the game
Know the things that'll get you knocked off cause niggas out here ain't playin'
Bein' real done popped off, 2 pills and it's on
Got me way in New York 'bout to run up in your home
I'm way up your floor, get my money and I'm gone
And if he payed me on time then we wouldn't have to show em'
But they got a place for him like they got a place for me
Maybe we'll meet again, we'll just have to wait and see
Thug niggas, i love killers who cock it back and bust
Remember me i used to smoke weed on the school bus
Nigga what, Nigga who, Nigga what you wan' do
I'm Young Buck, now move and let me come through
Is it true before you die do you really see it comin'
Do the hardest nigga cry and start runnin'

(Chorus x2)
I wonder if i died and came back
Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like i was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that
I knooowwwww

(Verse 3)
Politicians is bullshittin and really Bill Clinton is the
Closest we getting to ever having a black president
Still i feel heaven sent and, Tryin to walk with my head up
Cause now we got this anthrax shit to be scared of
Nobody prepared us for this
All they said was "make sure you watch the news at six"
And we feeding all these other countries
What about that old man eatin out the fuckin' dumpster
Oh you don't know him but everything goes up must come down
One love to all the projects that got torn down
I'm ridin' with God, me and my squad nigga U.T.P
Now we ballin but just remember how it used to be
So regardless never let nothing come between
Our family, our money, our dream
And even when it seems like it's all over
From Tennessee to the Magnolia
We gonna ball till we fall

(Chorus x4)
I wonder if i died and came back
Would God still make a nigga stay here and slang crack
Would everybody treat me like i was the same cat
There's gotta be somebody who can come and explain that
I knooowwwww
