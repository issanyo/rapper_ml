[Intro: Young Buck]
I see we had a long night last night
10 cops shot, Dallas what it do?
Cashville we on our way (Hey!)

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I just seen some killer's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I just seen some gangsta's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I look at these shootings like I did that (I just did that)
I tried to tell them these blood nigga's with dat
I just seen some crips get some get back (Wuddup cuz)
I'm just trying to tell Obama that we with dat
And this shit ain't over

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Laying on the roof waiting for 12 to come through
.223 shells what they hell they gon' do?
Gripping on the handle
Thinking about Philando (Rest in peace)
I'ma blow out his candles, make him out of example
I'ma take you to Atlanta
I'ma hit em with it while I get em with it
Pussy nigga's stay away from me if you ain't really with it
Rap nigga's keep preaching this peace shit
But just on some last week shit
You was talking that street shit
That Pulling up busting your heat shit
Look how they laid that hand
That baby was sitting in the back seat
Bitch we not crazy this how you made me
I can't let them see me hit
I'm not putting my hands up my black life don't matter
I rather return mine with that ratta tatta tatta tatta

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I just seen some killer's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I just seen some gangsta's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I look at these shootings like I did that (I just did that)
I tried to tell them these blood nigga's with dat
I just seen some crips get some get back (Wuddup cuz)
I'm just trying to tell Obama that we with dat
And this shit ain't over

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Good morning I woke up smelling gun powder
Call this that black power
11 body's in 4 hours
558 of us already died though
In 2016 by the hands of the 5-0
I ain't wrote none of this shit down (Real shit) truthfully
I done lost my passport I suppose to be in Switzerland
50 don't even know about this but I know he listening (My bad)
Since I missed the show I figured get high right now!
Make these nigga's load up and go kill a cop right now!
So any rapper putting anything out not right now!
I'ma do this for the Mike Brown's and the Trayvon's and the Sandra's
I'ma show you I can say shit and make police out of examples

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I just seen some killer's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I just seen some gangsta's get some get back
I tried to tell these police that we with dat
I look at these shootings like I did that (I just did that)
I tried to tell them these blood nigga's with dat
I just seen some crips get some get back (Wuddup cuz)
I'm just trying to tell Obama that we with dat
And this shit ain't over

[Outro: Young Buck]
Yeah
Sometimes you know
You gotta fight fire with fire
You just gotta do what you gotta do
You know do the math my nigga
I know I know shit seem crazy but it is crazy
Thugging with a conscience though
Fuck the police
Shit how the fuck can you turn to mother fucker
When they already turning on you
It is what it is
Fuck with me
