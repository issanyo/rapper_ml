[Intro]
Aye-Uh Huh Huh Huh

[Verse 1]
Don't ask me where the fuck I'm from, or whudd set I claim
I git money (Yuh!), I got a lil' bit of both games in me
Niggas hate so the mossberg hang wit' me (Owh!)
Feds wanna tap up my phone, cause they can't git me
I might as well give it to ya since Dre sent me
Just sit back and kick ya feet up, Okayye 50?
I'm on 1 and I just begun
I dare one of these blood claats come test me gun
Tha rude bwoi of the south, let me in this bitch
I just wish 2Pac was here to witness this
Give me room to breathe and I'mma blow you away
I move a 100 bricks a week and do a show every day
Ayyye, somebody gotta do it y'all
See I done been locked up and I ain't know who to call
It's my time, so everybody jump on the train
See when the A.K. aimed, I can shootdown a plane (Mothafucka!)

[Hook: Kokane]
Haters, what makes you wanna do wrong? (Makes you wanna do wrong?)
Just to wake up early, afta hustlin' all night long (Yeh-eh-eh-eh-uhh)

[Verse 2]
My gun damn near bigga then me
I ain't the nigga to beef
Cause everytime a body drop, niggas mentionin' me
I see a judge in my dreams when he sentencin' me
My homeboi come in the courtroom and hit him with 3
I got the mind of a nigga 'bout to git him a kii (Yuh!)
All the feins lined up, they just waitin' fo' me
Betta hurry-hurry, it's about to go down
And don't cha worry, I brought a 100 rounds (Buck!)
We gon' count to ten and then put the clips in
Whoeva is tha last man standin' wins (C'monn!)
You throw some money in the hood and it always works
My niggas crazy, they'll dig a dead body from the durrt (Yeahh)
Betta watch ya mouth, cause I been watchin' ya house
I'm in ya bushes like, "When this nigga gon' come out?!"
It's enough of this he say-she say shit
Now it's time to find out who you wit'

[Hook]

[Outro: Kokane]
The streets ain't got no love (Oh but I'm a nigga on top of thangs)
These niggas don't feel my pain (Oh these niggas don't got a clue what I been through mayn')
I ain't even lookin' fo' love (Oh but I ain't lookin' fo' all ya sympathy)
I gots to just do my thang

[Hook]
