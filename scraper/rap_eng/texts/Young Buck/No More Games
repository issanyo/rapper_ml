[Verse 1: Young Buck]
They say god bless the child that can hold his own
And he who is loyal, allways live long
A real hood nigga gets money and gives back
So when i got money bitch i did just that
I put packs in the hands of the dope man
Put gats in the hands of my old friends
Listen when i tell ya, i dident even really know game
When i said his name, on pop em them thangs
Yea i got on all blue, thats how i do
Tommarow its all red the bloods love me too
Im true, and every nigga around me knew it
But you, are only hard around ya boys
I knew, when fiffty gave you your first watch
Wrote you ya first verse, wrote you ya first drop
We dident really need ya, homie know im gone see ya
Dont ever bite the hand and feed ya
Bitch niggaaa

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Now if its beef, then go ahead, let the war start
Do what you do best, have a change of heart
You a man with breast, simaller to a brawd
You disrespect that the west when they find out who you are
Do ya thug thing, spit ya 300 bars
But me and banks garage, makes up 300 cars
You not a solder homboy, you come from a stripp clubb
Ya name is dolja, i can show you the pictures blood
The game is over, nigga change ya cloths
Look at cha, you lookin like a video how
And i was on the phone when spider loc called ya
Ya punk ass said you ain't want no problem
You try to diss memph bleek, throw lines at jay
Have ya ass apologyzin, the vary next day
Damn right radio gone play my shit
Wonda what trey gone say bout thise
Game over

[Verse 3: Spider Loc]
Now i seen that tought talk and it swell to find it
And thats why, for so long, i can held my silence
But im from ec g-unit, i bangs the game
And its needless to say, that i slang them thangs
I got love for the west, and im asamed of game
And not because his album was full of famous names
See im everything he wishin he was, but hes nothin like me
Can't you tell from all the dissin he does. he be all about poblesity buzz
Cause when he meet at the club, he be all about kisses and hugs
He rent yukmout the loc, you ain't touch him one time
When you said, that joe buddens was only punch lines
Out here we gangbang, know for known for heatin up guest
Thats that, [somethin] beatin up rats
Underbated, cause its hard to understand this nigga
Hes spose to represent the riders, but he ran from jail
