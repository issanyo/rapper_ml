And I just got a spot in tha -A-
So shawty wussup!

[Verse 1]
Yeah show me whatchu got gurl
I ain't from around here, take me to ya world
Crystal and patrone, and you know it's on (Yo!)
A Gangsta Grill mixtape, just to keep it goin' (Uh-oh, Aye!)
Mint flow so you gotta take ya shoes off (Whudd!!)
It's more room in this phanton then a U-Haul
Shawty say she down wit' it, but she got a mayn' (Huh!!)
And she ain't really use to havin' one nite stands (Ha ha)
So what's it gon' be - show me where ya live
Put ya head down baby, let me see ya grill
Gone wit' ya bad azz, make them ho's hate (Aye!)
Well make up ya mind, real niggas don't wait (Nah!)
What's it gonna take fo' ya to break us all off (C'monn)
Neva thought I'd see tha day when I'd be askin' what it costs (Fo' Sho'!)
Ice on my teeth got her starrin' in my mouf
As soon as i find myself a freak - I'm OUT!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Here ya go babydoll, take two of these

Gon' feel like a millian bucks in dis Porsche truck
Gotta big white cup full of purple stuff (Yeaahhh!!)
Sales blowin' gone up, yeah they want Buck (Uhh!)
If yee'in lettin' a nigga fuck - I ain't showin' up
In tha strip club gone on dat Grey juice (Owh!!)
These ho's crushin' down pills in they Orange juice
Do ya thang ma, I ain't gotta problem wit' it
And when ya finished, roll tha weed up and I'ma hit it! (Buck!)

When ya see me in tha streets, you can speak! (You can speak)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
So holla!

Aye Nay, rememba what I said
