It's about to go down
Get out the way, get out the way
Better move, it's about to go down
Get out the way, get out the way
You better move 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Ain't nobody goin' broke, everybody sellin' dope
Everybody gettin' money, it's some niggas tellin' no
We ain' talkin' on the phone, I don't know ya, I ain't servin' ya
Nobody never heard of ya, you're fuckin' wit' some murderers
Look at my wrist, look at my bitch
She hold daddy down, help a nigga get rich
This patron got me hot, the Phantom in the lot
See this pill kickin' in and I'm standin' wit my Glock
In this bitch like move, I need some elbow room
Got me spillin' liquor, why the club close so soon?
Burn this bitch up, we 'bout to get Buck
Gimme a light, tell the DJ, turn my shit up, it's on now
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Cup fun of Hennessy, my niggas call it Gasoline
Pussy niggas fill up and say shit they don't mean
Stuntin' wit cha real money that'll get chu killed
See probly wan' this paper, my baby needs some milk
Bitch, we built this city, the dope boy committee
I still got the nerves to saddle up and come and get it
A product of the projects, my momma's only son
Made my first million dollars and a new drama would come
Didn't run from it, I ran to it
I'm not playin' 'bout the Unit and my fans knew it
Now make a lane for me 'cause I deserve this
I wonder what my enemies get when they hear this
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me
Got a blunt of green sticky and my AK wit me
If a motherfucker hit me, I'ma knock his head off
I ain't scared of none of y'all, bitch, I'm runnin' from the law
Put your trigger fingers up, if you will knock they head off
Pushing weight all through the state
It's like I speed up when they tell me, "Pump my brakes"
If I told you what I make every time I flip a kii
You would prolly try to take the same trip that I take but you can't
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a nigga through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
