[Intro]
Yeah, woop woop!
Its about 60 blunts on the table
Bunch of locs in the studio
It's 4 in the morning nigga
I'm proud of y'all niggas cuh'

[Hook x2]
The way niggas been running through these bricks
Boy, I'm proud of ya
The way niggas been loading up these clips
Just know I'm proud of ya
The way shawty been stacking up her chips
Bitch, I'm proud of ya
I'm getting money, I ain't stunting on none of this shit
We so proud of ya

[Verse 1]
Hold up, I ain't through yet
Bitch, I'm walking around like a new check
Got a closet full of brand new shit
Real street nigga, you knew this
Y'all niggas make me come do this
Live a whole world like who this
I got a 100 in, lets move this
They done talked about me like Jesus
They done locked up all of our leaders
We got powder stuffed in our Pumas
Acid all in our Adidas
I got Xanax bars in my pocket
She got molly pills in her purse
If you pull it nigga better pop it
It's about who shoot first
I done fell in love with the money
Got a preacher saying you cursed
I'm telling him just keep praying
That the money come do you worse
Bars sounding like I got Biggie lungs
Walking like I got Pac feet
Talking like I got Malcolm's tongue
Martin Luther with the King speech
Looking like I'm fresh off the slum
Hungry nigga I come to eat
And I'm bringing the bullet for anybody
That ever did anything to me
I do all my dirt by lonely
I don't need nobody need to come and hang with me
This is for all of my homies that not did not change on me
That's that real shit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Hold up, lemme roll up
Dope money my pockets swolled up
Whole pints getting towed up
Real niggas just showed up
And the whole block get sold up
Better let us in you know us
Where that check at? You owe us
You a fuck nigga, we soldiers
(You a fuck nigga, we don't fuck with you)
You a fuck nigga, we soldiers
(You a fuck nigga, we don't fuck with you)
Ain't getting money, you bogus
Ain't fucking witcha, I'm focused
I ain't never running out of dope
I'm consistent though if you noticed
I remember what the plug told us
When they put the weight on my shoulders
And the young niggas outgrow us
Gotta pass it down to the oldest
Can't stop now, keep going
Getting locked down, no hoeing
Get shot down start shooting
Get robbed nigga, start looting
These bitches gon' start choosing
These niggas gon' start losing
My nigga boo on Death Row right now 'bout to die by execution
I'm going crazy with the money
I need a mental institution
Or a minute with my partner before they gas and seduce 'em
Just to tell 'em, boy, I'm proud of ya

[Hook x2]
