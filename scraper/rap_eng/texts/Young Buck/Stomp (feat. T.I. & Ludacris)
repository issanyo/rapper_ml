(Intro-Young Buck)
Uh Ohhhhh, Young Buck
Dirty South, Yeahhh

(Chorus-Young Buck)
I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, Im'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' Wanna Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

(Verse one-Young Buck)
I'm Caddillac'n Through The Hood, Sittin' On 24's
T.V's Playin, Rim's Spinnin, Blowin' Plenty Dro
Don't Have To Mention, When You Pimpin, You Get Plenty Hoes
It's All On You, If You Gon' Trick, Or You Gon' Get Yo' Dough
I Know I Got These Haters Mad, I Can Love That
When You Got Love For The Streets, They Give Ya' Love Back
Look In My Eyes, You Can Tell I Ain't Never Scared
Poppin' Them Thangs, I'm Rockin My Chain Anywhere
If You Gon' Represent Your Hood, What You Waitin On?
Security Better Back Up, When They Play This Song
And We 'Bout 50 Strong, Please Don't Make Us Do You Wrong
My Click Of Guerrillas, They Got They G-Unit's On
All Of That Mean Muggin' Really Don't Mean Nuthing
C'mon Take It Outside, Lemme See Sumthin
Wha-Wha-Wha-What Now?
Don't Get Bu-Bu-Bu-Buck'd Down
Stop All This Hatin' Or This Club Gon' Get Shu-Shut Down
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

(Chorus-Young Buck)
I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, Im'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' Wanna Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

(Verse two-TI)
Aye, A 100 Karots On The Chest, I'm So True To This
Task Force Got My Vest, I Got A New Bitch
Fans Hate And Talk Shit, But I'm Too Legit
A Million Dollars At A Time, Till Im Super Rich
Pimp Squad, G-Unit, Fuck Who You Get
Ask Your Neice's And Nephew's, I'm The Shit
Real Niggas See The Diffrence Between You And This
Me Gettin Beat Down?, Thats Ludacris
My Name Rang From The Streets, And Slang In Mechanicsville
Nigga Are You Gettin It Rodney Dangerfield?
No Respect, Im'a Vet, You Can Bet That
I Caught Some Cases, But It's Just A Minor Set Back
And If I Have To Do Some Time, I'll Be Right Back
With Some Thighs, And Some Tri's And A Six Pack
We Hit The Door, Watch All The Pussy Nigga Get Back
They Know We Can Do It Like The Road, But You Ain't With That
You Know Who Make That Track Bump, Like To Keep It Crunk
It's Chopper's Hit Ya Ass, You'll With Ya Got Your Ass Stomp'd

(Chorus-Young Buck)
I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, Im'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' Wanna Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off

(Verse three-Ludacris)
Muthafucka, I'm A Monster In This Game, Similar To The Loch Ness
My Rhymes Is Nappy Rooted, Sum Verces Gotta Process
The Truth In This Booth, Ain't No Doubt When I'm Rappin'
If I Say It, I've Either Done It, Or It's 'Bout To Happen
When I Pull Up In The Louis Truck On 26's, People Dumb Out
If Lifes A Crack Game, I'm Rollin' 7's On The Come Out
These Rapper's Think I'm Ig-nant, Love Sayin' My Name
Cuz Maintainin My Fish Tank, And They House, Cost The Same
Ask Me, I'd Say I Made It, And It Sure Wasn't Luck
Cuz Hustler's Relate To Me, And Some Are Younger Than Buck
You See I'm Married To My Music, But We Got A Prenupt
So If That Bitch Don't Act Right, I'm Still Gettin My Cut
My Deals Never Get Screwed, My Contracts Practice Abstinence
I'm Masterin This Program, Hazin' These Undergraduates
So, Pimpin' Be Easy, Quit Catchin' Feelings
Cuz You Worth A Couple Hundred Grand, And I'm Worth Millions
Nobody's Thinkin' About You, Plus Your Beats Ain't Legit
So Please Stay Off The T.I.P. Of My Dick

(Chorus-Young Buck)
I Hear Him Talkin', But He 'Bout To Get That Ass Stomp
Watch, I Get The Club Crunk, Im'a Make 'Em Stomp
We Ain't Playin' Wanna Front, You Can Get That Ass Stomp
Do It Like Them Dirty South Boys, Do, And Stomp
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
Now Where You From? Who The Boss? Im'a Break Him Off
Where You From? Who The Boss? Lemme Break Him Off
