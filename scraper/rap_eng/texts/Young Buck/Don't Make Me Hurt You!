(feat. Tony Yayo)

Yeah from New York to Ca$hville nigga we doin' it real big
These niggas ain't playin' out here man

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
You see them baseball caps with them real big signs
I'm aimin' that gat and i'm dumpin' three times

[Whoo Kid:] BRING IT BACK

[Jamie Foxx:]
Yo this is Jamie Foxx
I don't know what the hell you doin' right now
Put your blunts down
We got a new exclusive

[Tony Yayo:]
Yeah from New York to Ca$hville nigga we doin' it real big
These niggas ain't playin' out here man

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
You see them baseball caps with them real big signs
I'm aimin' at that and i'm dumpin' three times
Chains one twenty, the house is a mill
And the car is one eighty with the rims and the grill
When the blood spill
Niggas die off of beef rap
Drop top Bentley Azzure the roof detach
This why ya ho with me, you got the dry balls
I spent twelve on the gators with the eye balls

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Macs, AKs, and all that shit
An Automatic 357 with hollowtips
Pistol grip pump
You should hear it when it dump
Got to hold it with rubber gloves just shoot it and it dump
Mouth swingin' lookin' like a crack fiend fiendin'
I think I see demons
And no I ain't dreamin'
I'm schemin'
Lookin' for a fool with jewels
I'm about to see if its true what an Uzi do

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Don't make me hurt you
I ain't 'gon tell you twice
I will come and take your life
Don't make me hurt you
I ain't even playin' no games
I come through homie sprayin' them thangs
Don't make me hurt you

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
No vest
A skinny little nigga no chest
No stress
I left the scene clean no mess
Oh yes
I will get it done for fun
If he continue to just keep runnin' his tongue
My knife 'll hit him right in his lung
So if he do pull through he'll still be gone
G Unit South on my neck
Don't need no check
I flip mine with the work that I got from my respect

[Verse 3: Tony Yayo]
I'm there on weekends
With Puerto Ricans
The five star hotels with females freakin'
Nigga stop reachin'
My gun shoot around corners
So call the coroner
I make it hot like a sauna
Nine zeros on the check thats lots of cream
Ya'll plot and scheme
Fifth kick like a soccer team
Ambulance pick you up now they rushin' to save you
While I jump in the S5

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Don't make me hurt you
I ain't 'gon tell you twice
I will come and take your life
Don't make me hurt you
I ain't even playin' no games
I come through homie sprayin' them thangs
Don't make me hurt you
