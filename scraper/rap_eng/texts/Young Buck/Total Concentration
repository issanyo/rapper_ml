[Intro: Young Buck]
Ayy, Kerser, what up homie?
I tell my bitch just be patient

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Nah, fuck that, I tell my bitch take the vacation
Take her family with her and lace 'em (go 'head)
What I’m doing in these streets
I need total concentration
She know how much time I’m facing, she just say that she just looking now
She know how I feel about them messy bitches at my house
I don’t need no middleman, I let my junkies test it out
So much coke in this compartment, got my driver stressin' out
You have no idea how many ounces I’ve been stretching now
All these niggas owe me rent, I can’t wait to catch 'em out
Bitches talking shit on tour, they can’t wait to see what this ‘bout
I take everything seri', can’t play me with your mouth
I make sure that they hear us, I don’t talk behind no backs
I don’t go for disrespect and I don’t play ‘bout moving they sack, that’s a fact

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for (work)
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)

[Verse 2: Future]
Ooh, that iPad and that iPhone, I work hard from both
Mix the molly with the lean and we gone have a toast
Stuntin' like I ain't got shit, I hustle hard the most
Stuntin' like I ain't got shit, I hustle hard the most
The Bentley Coupe, the Maybach, shit, I might just cop the Ghost (skrrr skrrr)
A hundred-thousand on the weekend, I can't brag or boast
They call me Mr Fire Marshall, sellin' out the coast
The police station down the club before I do the show
Got a iced out watch, got a iced out chain
Got some iced out ears and a iced out ring
Got a big bankroll and it won't even fold
Put it in the pot, nigga, drop it in the bowl
Twenty-four hours, trap don't even close
Got money by the pound, got pounds by the low
Catch me in a Louis store buying up the store
Got cash on fire, nigga, everything's go

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for (work)
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)

[Verse 3: Kerser]
I told her suck my dick, I’m ‘bout to pour my cup
She had the camera on, I said, ”Don’t you record, you cunt”
Wait a minute, Aussie accent got ‘em trippin' out
I’m so disrespectful, find your boys grave and I dig him out
What we about? We about the pay
Search the name, it’s curse with a K (Kerser)
Half 'em boys are all locked away
Try tell them put the Glocks away
Who said Sydney ain’t raw? Shit, I’m laughing at that
Got a shooter who can put your fuckin' heart through your back
Buyin' new cars that’s old to me, shout to the boys in stolen Jeeps
Back in Campbelltown we never had no silver spoon (nah)
The junkies had it, shootin' up, we'd watch the dealers cruise
Down by the beach in the house I bought
Pull out big cash, can’t count it all (fuck)
Skinny white cunt and I walk with a chainsaw
'Kay, I gotta stop, this is all I got paid for

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)
I pull up in this spaceship and it's paid for (work)
A big ol' bankroll and I got my shades low (I got work)

[Outro: Young Buck]
Ooh
Ghost, what up though?
Buck
Y'all know wassup
