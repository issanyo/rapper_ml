[Intro]
Where you get this shit from nigga
Yo I'm high than a muthafucka
G-Unit, smoke som’

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
They call me Smokey the Bear, known for keeping smoke in the air
I push a Benz with ashes everywhere
I fiend for the green, failing my piss test-ts on the regular
Violate my probation but I still ain't never there
I do what I'm tellin’ ya when I say that I get high
Wou'nt old enough to drive when I caught a DUI
Ask me legit how we get when Buck touchdown
Take me straight to the hemp museum and purchase me a pound
I got me some purple, now I'm 'bout to split few-
And take 50 on a tour through these Cashville streets
I can't wait till I see Snoop and get some of that good shit
It's G-Unit to the bone, man we on some hood shit
Yeah I prolly could quit, but I said when I'm deceased
Put a ounce in my casket, let me smoke one in peace
All I need is a leaf, a lighter, and get some fire
Then you wonder why I always look tired
I'm high nigga

[Chorus]
I don’t know nan nigga that smoke more than me
G-Unit niggas need at least a pound a week
I got philly blunts-, buckets of dutches
When you roll it all up it’s nothin'
I don’t know nan nigga that smoke more than me
G-Unit niggas need at least a pound a week
I got philly blunts-, buckets of dutches
When you roll it all up it's nothin'
