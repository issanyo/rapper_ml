[Intro:]
Fuck a diss record
I'm on that get the bricks record
I wanna get rich record
YOU FUCK BOYS!!

[Verse 1:]
I be sippin' lean with the good lord doin' drug deals with the devil
But my brothers been out on tour but I been gettin' it on another level
I can't twitter beef with these pussy niggas I'm trying to get get rich forever
And you know I roll with a whole lot of Crips that will load of clips that will hit whoever
Tell that lil nigga better get his together
Hard headed I don't know no better
No friends came home from the pen
Wit a pocket full of lint and a Big Meech letter
And I'm fuck wat Donald Trump talk bout I like change when I met Rosetta
So I'm on my way to the border pickin up a order running through the dust
Bitch you know still running round with the Desert
Can't let a nigga take my treasure
Gotta keep it in the street
These niggas too weak
Some beefs just never get settled
I would buy a brick with your bezel
I would spray a Mac at your Maybach
I be really rich rollin' cuz and niggas know I don't play that

[Hook:]
Bitch I helped El Chapo come home
I'm too turnt
Aye Bitch you know
(I know they told you)
I know you know
(Don't play with me)
Bitch I helped El Chapo come home
(I got the hood turnt)
Aye did you know
(I know they told you)
I know you know
(Don't fuck with me)

[Verse 2:]
Real niggas ain't got time to entertain none of that fake shit
I don't wanna hear about Nicki, Meek Mill or none of that Drake shit
? Still been ducking curly head he hoping out the gay shit
My young been trying to get some bread so I gave him a 8th to play with
I still on that AK shit the one that I shoot up the rafe with
Choppa give that nigga face lift you know imma do wat u say Fif
I'm trying to keep you out way Fif
I know you'll pull up where they stay Fif
I'll get it done with the yay Fif
You ain't go when u say Fif
Rich niggas stay hand to hand
White, green, brown and the tan
Running round with the Taliban
Trying to kill the man that killed Sandra Bland
Imma stick ya chain and play ?
Imma put this pistol to ya brain
I got the plug permission
Some of yall bout to come up missing

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Bitch I helped El Chapo come home
(Loco, Loco)
Bitch I helped El Chapo come home
(I got the hood turnt)
(Loco, Loco)
(I know they told you)
(Don't fuck with me)

[Young Buck talking:]

You know I'm on that shit
So miss me with the bullshit
