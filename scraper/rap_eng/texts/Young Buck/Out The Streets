[Chorus]
I told the plug I'm tryin' anything to get it out the streets
(get it out the streets, gotta get it out the streets)
I got Guccis on my feet I have to get it out streets
(got it out the streets, I got it out the streets)
I see killers get caught sleepin' when they left 'em in the streets
(left 'em in the streets, get 'em off our industry)
Even when they make us diggin', bitch I kept it in the streets
(kept it in the streets, I'm gon' keep it to the streets)

[Verse 1]
No I don't take no problems to no Twitter nigga (Don't do that)
I don't do no Instagram or snap, I just go get a nigga (let get it nigga)
Don't got no e-mail or no DM, I can see you nigga (what?)
It just can't be all year, this real shit gotta be in you nigga
We've been goin' body for body, Gangland
If they crossin' on their partners, stop the ways your main man
Bitch I've been watchin' with binoculars just to hold out their hand
Everybody else just tryin' get whatever they can
All of this gossipin' like I give a Fuck 'bout what they sayin'
Wanna talk it when I'm at him with this AK sprayin'
Hold the ... and I'm prayin' one of these niggas think I'm playin'
Bitch I'm 'bout it, niggas can fuck up the cartels plan

[Chorus]
I told the plug I'm tryin' anything to get it out the streets
(get it out the streets, gotta get it out the streets)
I got Guccis on my feet I have to get it out streets
(got it out the streets, I got it out the streets)
I see killers get caught sleepin' when they left 'em in the streets
(left 'em in the streets, get 'em off our industry)
Even when they make us diggin', bitch I kept it in the streets
(kept it in the streets, I'm gon' keep it to the streets)

[Verse 2]
We no make no statements on no cases (nahh)
We no show no faces, relocate to different places (rollin')
3 thousand for the Louboutins I rock 'em with no laces (no laces)
Violated my probation but I'm right back to the basics
Shawty we've been goin' brick for brick, Drug war
My young niggas ridin' with them sticks, the trust is yours
I got scales on the table, I got burglar-boy toys
Niggas tryin' get me once the shit won't happen no more
Watched my cousin take his last breath, Gangland
I shot you if you dind't shoot it and you have one in your hand
I just knew what you would do soon as them bullets get to spray
Country nigga out here crippin' politicin' in the land
What up cuz?

[Chorus]
I told the plug I'm tryin' anything to get it out the streets
(get it out the streets, gotta get it out the streets)
I got Guccis on my feet I have to get it out streets
(got it out the streets, I got it out the streets)
I see killers get caught sleepin' when they left 'em in the streets
(left 'em in the streets, get 'em off our industry)
Even when they make us diggin', bitch I kept it in the streets
(kept it in the streets, I'm gon' keep it to the streets)
