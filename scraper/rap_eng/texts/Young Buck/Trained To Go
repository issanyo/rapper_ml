[Intro]
Ain't it crazy what time do?
Time can heal things
Or time can make things worse
What time you on?

[Verse 1]
I'm inside this double y
With a couple of pies
A couple of guys who don’t care
About it if your mother dies
Twistin' my wrist and let it bubble
Nigga, once it rise
I’m not finished with it yet
I got a surprise
I’m not moving with it wet
But once it dries
Pull up in the projects
And open up their eyes
Fuck ‘em, I got Columbian ties
So I be damned if I let you
Break me down in your size
You little nigga
And if that bitch ain’t Nicki Minaj
I treat a hoe like my Chevy
And park her in my garage
You out here playn bout this paper
Tryna dance with the stars
And boy I’m busy baggin’ pounds
Tryna pack it in cars
I told my partner “what we got, if nothing is ours?
So get your ass back on that block and don’t come back till it’s yours”
They say money can’t buy you happiness
But damn, I’m feeling good
Bet everybody would go and get some millions
If they could

[Hook]
Fuck with me and I'mma let it go
Bitch broke and I'mma let her go
Getting money and I'mma let it show
Street nigga, I'm just letting you know
Taking everything I came for
So please stay in your lane, ho
Hittin' everything I aim for
T.T.G. nigga, I'm trained to go

[Verse 2]
Shit, I didn’t plan on getting’ out and gettin' back in it
Till Papi pulled up in that ‘lac with the back tinted
Looked at my whip and politely asked “Is that rented?"
I said "I’m done” He said “That’s a terrible way to end it”
I’m thinking "Yeah, you right, but give me a minute"
He told me "time is money, and if you got it, then spend it!
But if you wanna get on it, these niggas waiting to get it. They really
Wit it, besides, that there ain’t paying your tickets
So what it do?
You gone wait around to evicted?
And let these rappers and magazine writers get it twisted?
Nigga, you gifted
Jesus fell from the cross, but He was lifted
Once He got back on his feet, that’s when He shifted"
None of this shit is scripted
All of this shit is true
I guess this must be the difference between me and you
Look what I been through
And where I been to
And look at what some years
In a fuckin’ pen do!
It’s Buck, bitch!

[Hook]
Fuck with me and I'mma let you go
Bitch broke and I'mma let her go
Getting money and I'mma let it show
Street nigga, I'm just letting you know
Taking everythang I came for
So please stay in your lane, ho
Gettin' everything I aim for
T.T.G. nigga, I'm trained to go
