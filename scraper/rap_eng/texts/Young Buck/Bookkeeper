[Chorus: Nephewblaq]
Me I'm the bookkeeper
Yea I keep the books right
All I do is count money
Tell them dummies sell dummies
Never got my hands dirty
Yea my fingernails clean
I can get you [?] bandz and a pair of jeans
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Let the paper stack and tell them dummies they can sell dummies

[Verse 1: Nephewblaq]
Made a little money now they callin' me an uncle Tom
Bunch of broke niggas sittin' round and they buckin' guns
[?], let the choppa off with the drum
Made it out the slums makin' dummies sell soapstone [?]
Bad yellow bitch bite her ass like a fresh plum
Ask that nigga he ate the pussy when it's lukewarm
Ever seen a dead man talk about what happened to him
Bandz on his head and watch them boys put a clap into him
Calculating currency residuals and earners fees and [?]
Quarter key make these bitches notice me
So extraordinary I'm the only real [?]
Talkin' 'bout you cause they know it ain't no hoe in me

[Chorus: Nephewblaq]
Me I'm the bookkeeper
Yea I keep the books right
All I do is count money
Tell them dummies sell dummies
Never got my hands dirty
Yea my fingernails clean
I can get you [?] bandz and a pair of jeans
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Let the paper stack and tell them dummies they can sell dummies

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Whoopin' with the work
Finessin' with the fork
I don't go to court, No
She ain't never short
All my white girl do is snort
Whip, whip, half to a zip
A half a million in the bag nigga let's take a trip (let's get it)
Flip, flip, keep a full clip
And a full cup
You niggas full of shit
I been sellin' dope since they was makin' paper food stamps
We been fuckin' on these hoes since they was wearin' Jellies (jellies)
I'm Buckin' boomin' and bangin' I'm trappin' out the tailgates
I'm smokin' on that smelly and I'm really really ready
I know I look light but I'm really really heavy
Dope boy, all a nigga do is count fetty

[Chorus: Nephewblaq]
Me I'm the bookkeeper
Yea I keep the books right
All I do is count money
Tell them dummies sell dummies
Never got my hands dirty
Yea my fingernails clean
I can get you [?] bandz and a pair of jeans
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Let the paper stack and tell them dummies they can sell dummies

[Verse 3: Nephewblaq]
Everything great when the junkies eatin' corn flakes
Ever seen a junky snort the frost off a corn flake
Used to eat ramen noodles now I'm eatin' big steaks
Books lookin' good yea blaq got his shit straight
Want a Panamera but I bought me a big truck
I'm a real g that sip lean and get his dick sucked
I'm the cashier
[?] on the register
Got experience with this shit and y'all niggas regulars
Call me Mr. Profit
My team hit the margins
Y'all buildin' flowerbeds nigga we buildin' gardens
Every transaction and deposit is accounted for
Yea we gettin' money what you think I learned to count it for

[Chorus: Nephewblaq]
Me I'm the bookkeeper
Yea I keep the books right
All I do is count money
Tell them dummies sell dummies
Never got my hands dirty
Yea my fingernails clean
I can get you [?] bandz and a pair of jeans
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Me I'm the bookkeeper
All I do is count money
Let the paper stack and tell them dummies they can sell dummies
