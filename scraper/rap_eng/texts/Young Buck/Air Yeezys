[Verse 1]
Boy I feel like money my AC's on low
And in this round of crisis 3 hundred
And I got 8 more balls to go
Tell them young niggas I'm coming
Just get somewhere and be patient
The more that you keep texting me
The longer you keep waiting
My pitcher dine at their station
They mad they didn't find no cases
Since I provide no statements
Bitch let me out of this basement
A hundred racks of Latoya
I said bitch better not done wait you
If anything missing my nigga
They know I'm going places
The niggas still don't trust me
Wanna watch me while I cook it
The vice still can't bust me
I say I already shook it
What the fuck buck doing out here
I thought that nigga was rich
When it cuff that fair gun charge
I thought that nigga was snitch
Ain't Arizona just Melly
You fuck around with a felon
On the interstate I'm thrilling
Just think about who dealing
My uzzi matching my Louie
I'm a dope boy believe me
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys

[Hook]
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
Flashlight, flashlight
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys

[Verse 2]
I got 2 and a half money on my peep
Right now and I'm serving
Been dropping out holes
But since I'm pacing out I'm learning
Got Mississippi burning
And all my AK's joining
My nose stay in my business
Fuck that if it don't concern you
My mama house on fire
She keeps saying it's cool
I'm paying 32.5
And she be paying it too
We just both tryin' to survive
Praying we get through
Plus everybody in the neighborhood
Keep saying we should move
This brick shit too slow
That brown shit too fast
This purple lean keep pouring
That green mean I get cash
Tell 'em young niggas I'm coming
You been gone get your own stash
And the air yeezys I'm running
Trying to get it out with this bad
I'm sorry y'al for the wait
Didn't know shit was this bad
Just doubled up with my plow
Don't spit everything that I have
I did got married to the money
My broke bitch she mad
I don't know why you done it
All day sitting around on your ass

[Hook]
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
Flashlight, flashlight
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
I sell it, you buy it
I do it, you try it
And I'm running from the police in my air yeezys
