[Chorus:]
I’m in busting blocks top down just looking around for my ex b*tch
Hoe when I see her I’m a pull up and flex bitch
I’ve been running my bands up for these n*gga’s talking they check sh*t
Hoe when I see em I’m a pull up and flex b*tch
I know ya’ll been hating on me but now look at me (flex b*tch)
All these cars all this ice all these hoes let’s flex b*tch
Now ring your check up gone and flex b*tch
Every chance I get I got to flex flex b*tch

[Verse 1]
I know these police sick of us
We selling pounds off the Popsicle trucks
Said a hundred bricks by the mail box tell UPS to come pick it up
Got 50 bands in the grocery bag
I told my young n*ggas go split it up
All of this sh*t can’t fit in the casket with ya n*gga living it up
These broke hoes still waiting on me to come pay the bills (b*tch give it up)
You got to get the f*ck up out of here when your rent is up
F*ck boy got locked up and said send him something I’m like send him what
I live from these projects for a year yeah I ain’t sending nothing
I’m blowing bands with an attitude throwing racks at you like I’m mad at you
And I know y’all didn’t expect for all my n*ggas to have it too
But we flex on a b*tch spend a check on our wrist I’m blessed with this sh*t finesse on a b*tch

[Chorus]
I’m in busting blocks top down just looking around for my ex b*tch
Hoe when I see her I’m a pull up and flex bitch
I’ve been running my bands up for these n*gga’s talking they check sh*t
Hoe when I see em I’m a pull up and flex b*tch
I know ya’ll been hating on me but now look at me (flex b*tch)
All these cars all this ice all these hoes let’s flex b*tch
Now ring your check up gone and flex b*tch
Every chance I get I got to flex flex b*tch

[Verse 2]
She was f*cking with me
Now b*tch I an’t f*cking with ya
He was f*cking with me
No n*gga I won’t come and get ya
Y’all ain’t f*cking with me
Y’all ain’t bring no money with ya
N*gga’s ain’t gonna be satisfied with that fire fire
You know something hit ya
All of us got bank rolls you a selfie n*gga we the whole picture
You the only one that got some what about them n*gga’s that rolled with you
B*tch I am a go getter and back down for no n*gga
Some of all ya’ll n*gga’s gonna die broke you too old to let them hoes go
I know it look like money but I’m riding around with my old pistol
You thought that was your b*tch til I pulled up and my hoe killer
Flexing on a b*tch that check back and these hoe miss her
Flexing on a b*tch
I’m trying to f*ck her and her four sisters

[Chorus]
I’m in busting blocks top down just looking around for my ex b*tch
Hoe when I see her I’m a pull up and flex bitch
I’ve been running my bands up for these n*gga’s talking they check sh*t
Hoe when I see em I’m a pull up and flex b*tch
I know ya’ll been hating on me but now look at me (flex b*tch)
All these cars all this ice all these hoes let’s flex b*tch
Now ring your check up gone and flex b*tch
Every chance I get I got to flex flex b*tch
