[Verse 1: Young Buck]
So I got to keep rollin'
I'm acting like I don't know them
There's no hands that'll hold 'em
Stop talkin', just show them
Ain't no way you gon' lose
They gon' be praying that you lose
They gon' be saying that you through
Now what you gon' do?
Now what you gon' do now?
You don't know who's who now
And they lookin' at you now
All the haters coming through now
Let's see if you a rider
When you comin' under fire
And these niggas wanna try you
And the bitches can't deny you
That's the main reason why I

[Chorus: Young Buck & Twanée]
I don't play by no rules (play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues (paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose (way I'm gon' lose)
Ain't no way I should lose now (way I should lose)
What should I do?
I can't play by no rules

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I had to cut some people off now
I had to start from the bottom
I had to start breaking them off now
You can hear it now, I got 'em
Ain't no motherfucking way I can lose now
You can see it now I'm ridin'
Look at the way that I move now
You can see it now, I'm shining
I wonder what my enemies gonna do now
To the top now I'm climbing
You thinking everything cool now
But it's not, so I'm grinding
Now they're sayin' that they lookin' for you now
On the block where you find 'em
I'm doin' what a nigga got to do now
I don't know why these motherfucking rappers keep lyin'
That's the main reason why I

[Chorus: Young Buck & Twanée]
I don't play by no rules (play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues (paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose (way I'm gon' lose)
Ain't no way I should lose now (way I should lose)
What should I do?
I can't play by no rules

[Verse 3: Twanée]
Yeah I cut some people off too
Yeah but I quit my job and I moved
And I didn't care whose feelings I hurt
I had to do what I had to do
Yeah I've come so far, gotta start my own lane now
Got my home in my heart, got no reason to stop now
They wishin' on a star, I'ma be my own star
Ain't now way I'm gon' let them take that away, no
That's the main reason why I

[Chorus: Young Buck & Twanée]
I don't play by no rules (play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues (paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose (way I'm gon' lose)
Ain't no way I should lose now (way I should lose)
What should I do?
I can't play by no rules

[Outro: Twanée]
We don't play by no rules
We done paid all our dues
We don't play by no rules
No, no no no no no no, we don't play, no
