[Intro]
I don’t know how I be coming up with this shit
I ain’t wrote shit none of this shit I’m just talking from the heart nigga

[Chorus]
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
We posted up standing right here ain’t going nowhere
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
Still working we going to die trapping ain’t going no where
Theese hoes don’t want no broke nigga’s na na na  na
Ain’t fucking around with no broke nigga’s na na na na
So my nigga’s going to post up and stand right here till they money right
All my nigga’s that’s in the trap still trapping y’all know what it’s like

[Verse 1]
I don’t know about you but I know I’m on my way though
Double cup in the kitchen and in here whipping with this yayo
They hoes be saying I been missing they still going to do what I say though
Tell your baby daddy I got blocks bitch laker
10 bricks wrapped up in the Winnebago
Watch me make all this shit disappear in a day though
Boss I’m so full of fucking sauce call me prego (roll it)
I just showed banks so many bricks that I didn’t pay for
I just told kidd kidd to come and get it what’s the wait for
And yayo he been with it shit the whole New York state know
I didn’t come to play hoe (naw 50 I ain’t playing with these nigga’s)
No I didn’t come to play hoe I just lift the weight though
I’m praying that this package make it here it’s from the bay though
No nigga’s still finessing for the chick they selling clay though
10 tapes in 10 months now we still in May though
10 bullets 10 bricks 10 pints on the way hoe let’s go
Now they know

[Chorus]
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
We posted up standing right here ain’t going nowhere
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
Still working we going to die trapping ain’t going no where
Theese hoes don’t want no broke nigga’s na na na  na
Ain’t fucking around with no broke nigga’s na na na na
So my nigga’s going to post up and stand right here till they money right
All my nigga’s that’s in the trap still trapping y’all know what it’s like

[Verse 2]
Y’all know when the dope boys come through and that shit be running right
All the bitches going to do what the nigga’s getting money like
Ball like it’s the weekend even though this is a Monday night
Tell them nigga’s I got white and a dirty sprite
And a hundred rounds for nigga's trying to earn a stripe
I've been posting up for years bitch I deserve this life
Yeah yeah you serve my old hand yeah yeah we go way back
All this snitches shit is new we didn’t play that no no
We didn’t wear that no no we didn’t say that no no
We didn’t care then no no we didn’t pay that aight
We used to share then yeah yeah we didn’t weigh that no no
Back when nigga's kept the brick's where they stayed at

[Chorus]
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
We posted up standing right here ain’t going nowhere
My nigga’s still going to post up and they ain't going nowhere till they money right
Still working we going to die trapping ain’t going no where
Theese hoes don’t want no broke nigga’s na na na  na
Ain’t fucking around with no broke nigga’s na na na na
So my nigga’s going to post up and stand right here till they money right
All my nigga’s that’s in the trap still trapping y’all know what it’s like

[Outro]

Banks cold corner 3 it’s on the way
