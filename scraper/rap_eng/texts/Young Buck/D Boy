[Verse 1: BandGang Biggs]
Come on Nah!
Just downed 700
This bitch ain't got no worries but every time I put it on, make a bitch get out her shirt
One line cost 100, that's if you want that purp
I got Actavis and Sprite, I might mix it up in church
I'ma just keep it 100
My niggas like to drill but no Bob The Builder shit when I say drill they like to kill
I'm stuntin' while I'm swerving
1200 for my shoes we ain't stressing over here, lil nigga this shit's cool
It's strange how we be getting it
Stay changing up on niggas
See me at 1 o'clock by 2 o'clock it's some different
You see me with that Glock finna plot on a bitch nigga
I got eyes on all these niggas 'tryna play like they some killers
My chopper got a knife
Don't mean no disrespect but catch you looking at me wrong, I'm gon' put it in your chest
These hoes want me to rest
But I can't got no chill, and that's 'prolly the reason these hoes 'wanna give me neck...bitch!

[Hook: Biggs & (Young Buck)]
Young nigga getting money, I'm counting bands
If you ain't talking money I'ont understand
(I'm in the kitchen whip it with my left hand
East side, west side what you reppin'?)
I'm a D Boy
(Real D Boy
Stay strapped and I'm really in the streets boy)
Buffs on my face J's on my feet boy
(Mink to the floor I can show you how to eat boy)

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
My young nigga got bands
His mama got that work too
All we know is get the money, motherfuck a curfew
I just tell him be a man don't let nobody hurt you
Always remember teenagers can put in dirt too
The young niggas got brick money
Talk that shit money
Icy wrist money
Pay for the hit money
How I came out nobody pocket I just get money
That fuck your bitch money
Pay rent money
I got dope money this ain't 50 Cent money
I just bought my plug a Phantom thanks for what you did for me
Tell him [?] this that give this to your kids money
Think about it this that "you know what it is" money
I'm at the titty bar, leaning on a dirty Sprite
Thinking to myself which one of these hoes coming home tonight
I do what I want to do
No I don't know wrong from right
You on that broke nigga shit? That's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Biggs]
We invented saying chicken these niggas just wanna copy
I'm all Balenciaga's my bitch she off the Versace
My ex bitch keep calling she hotter than a tamale I got niggas on the block, they hotter than some wasabi hit the club with Young Buck
We cause a fucking tsunami
A nigga got mad so I told the bouncer to bounce him
It ain't like I'm a bitch, this jacket cost me some thousands if this bitch get a rip, I'm turning up to a thousand
All lot estate, I'm pouring lean on a mountain
Aid and lemonade that's why I'm leaning and drowsy
You ain't got no money but eating out at Katanas run my check up when it got me repeated from Coney Island
And after that bitch I got Tempur Pedic with them diamonds bought a chain, told them let the fucking diamonds sink inside it
ShredGang with me yeah we all with the violence ya'll lil niggas through this bitch acting like some minors...bitch
