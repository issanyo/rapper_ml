[Verse 1: Young Buck]
So I got to keep rollin'
I'm actin' like I don't know them
There's no hands that'll hold 'em
Stop talkin' just show them
Ain't no way you gon' lose
They gon' be praying that you lose
They gon' be saying that you through
Now whatchu gon' do?
Now whatchu gon' do now?
You don't know who's who now
And they lookin' at you now
All the haters comin' through now
Let's see if you a rider
When you comin' under fire
Any niggas wanna try ya
And the bitches can't deny ya
That's the main reason why I..

[Hook: Young Buck & Twanee]
I don't play by no rules
(Play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues
(Paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I should lose now
What should I do
I can't play by no rules

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I had to cut some people off now
I had to start from the bottom
I had to start breaking them off now
You can hear it now I got 'em
Ain't no motherfucking way I can lose now
You can see it now I'm ridin'
Look at the way that I move now
You can see it now I'm shining
I wonder what my enemies gonna do now
To the top now I'm climbing
You thinking everything cool now
But it's not so I'm grinding
Now they're sayin' that they're lookin' for you now
On the block where you find 'em
I'm doin' what a nigga got a do now
I don't know why these motherfucking rappers keep lyin'
That's the main reason why I..

[Hook: Young Buck & Twanee]
I don't play by no rules
(Play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues
(Paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I should lose now
What should I do
I can't play by no rules

[Verse 3: Twanee]
Yeah I cut some people off too
Yeah, but I quit my job and I moved
And I didn't care whose feelings I hurt
I had to do what I had to do
Yeah I've come so far, gotta start my own lane now
Got my home in my heart, got no reason to stop now
They wishin' on a star, I'm gonna be my own star
Ain't now way I'm gon' lot them take that away
That's the main reason why I..

[Hook: Young Buck & Twanee]
I don't play by no rules
(Play by no rules)
I done paid all my dues
(Paid all my dues)
Come and walk in my shoes
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I'm gon' lose
Ain't no way I should lose now
What should I do
I can't play by no rules

[Outro: Twanee]
We don't play by no rules
We done paid all our dues
We don't play by no rules
(No, no, no) We don't play
