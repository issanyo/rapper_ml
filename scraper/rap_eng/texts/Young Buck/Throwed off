[Verse 1]
This whole hood throwed off
They hit him up and rode off
And they say this your boss
But fuck it nigga YOLO
Ain’t matching so I’m throwed off
I’m ratchet yeah I’m throwed off
Strap can’t take my coat off
Just tryin’ to give my dope out
Shawty took her clothes off
And that ass so soft
She told me they be paying for him
But for me it’s no cost
My neck like the clothes off
Pay wig bout the hoes out
Put up me a phone and took a cold bean dose off
Hey let’s just have a smoke off
Hold it in no cough
You be getting told off
Come get your ass broke out
My tattoos like to show off
My chopper like to go off
Them pussy niggers rolled up
And I’m dare them to knock their dough off
Watch me get this load off
Know that I’ve been rolled off
I possibly been told on
But I’m still gon’ get this all off
Picked it up and drove off

Since they knocked LeBo off
MY city just been throwed off

[Verse 2]
My young niggas throwed off
City paper I goes off
2 ounces in the pat race
Don’t forget to cut their stove off
Big truck get a load off
Before that gotta load in
She say she want that remi
I told her make sure it’s sold in
Well connected both ends
Low low no rims
If our piece is 9
I make twelve on the slow in
Real niggas just rolled in
Our business no grinds
Nigga don’t help my friend
I get ’em knocked for fourteen
Nigga hating don’t know him
All together don’t know them
Put the pressure on the bitch ass nigga
Bruce Bowen
All the shit I told ’em
All the shit I showed ’em
This shit that mean none of you
Would’ve thought the pussy was golden
Run around and get throwed off
Guess you got no sense
My homie said he riding on him
No mass , no tits
That young nigga was throwed off
Broad day with a chopper
Only thing he left was that crime scene
And that helicopter
