Hey, I gotta slow down
I said we gotta slow down
Let me take you back to high school, '94
Well, at least when a **** had time to go
Walk to the bus stop, sellin' **** on the way
Lil' bad **** with a pocket full of ****
Fell in love with a shorty that was bad
I would go and skip class just so I could see that ****
But she was too fast and I was too slow
'Cause she wanted a **** who already had dough
She found her a man who was like 24
But what she didn't know, that he had plenty ****
She was too young, so now he got a new one
'Cause shorty went and bought her a new ****
See when she catch this ****, she gon' do somethin'
Not fight, but shorty gon' **** somethin'
But she never got a chance, a change of plans
**** herself in the back, puttin' the **** in her pants
Live life young, ****, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
Slow your roll, slow it down, my ****
Slow your roll, slow down, my ****
Live life, lil' mama, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
Slow your roll, c'mon, gotta slow down
Slow your roll, think you gotta slow down
I got a graveyard tatted on my arm
So I'ma just start with my uncle William Hahn
My momma only brother, he served in the navy
He lost his life because the war made him crazy
My nephew Shannen, 15 years old
When I think how he died, I get real cold
'Cause they found him in a field with some crack stones
There was no flesh, it was just bones
I was just home with my cousin Craig
And then I got a phone call, said they found him dead
So what's next, ain't went to Bizz funeral yet
Instead of one casket, I need two of them ****
It don't quit, just when you think I'm seein' better days
My auntie just find that she got AIDS
And it's **** up 'cause her life don't end
And she locked up, so she dyin' in the pen, ****
Live life young, ****, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
Slow your roll, slow it down, my ****
Slow your roll, slow down, my ****
Live life, lil' mama, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
Slow your roll, c'mon, gotta slow down
Slow your roll, think you gotta slow down
This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no more
(This can't be life we're living)
'Cause I don't wanna live no more
I don't wanna live no more
This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't want it no more, no more
This can't be life we're living
'Cause I don't want it no more, no more
Live life young, ****, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss momma when she dead and gone
Slow your roll, slow it down, my ****
Slow your roll, slow down, my ****
Live life, lil' mama, quit tryin' to be grown
You gon' miss daddy when he dead and gone
Slow your roll, c'mon, gotta slow down
Slow your roll, think you gotta slow down
