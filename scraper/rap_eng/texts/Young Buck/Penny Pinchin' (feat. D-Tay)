D-Tay Man deez niggas talkin bout dey got dis and dat

If you know Young Buck you know Money Motha Fuckas..

(Young Buck )
Man its all about platinum from the records to the neclace boi
Dont hand me the keys if it ain't show room floor
Ten diamonds in the rolli betta add ten more
From the bend up lift my hands up good lord
Wats the use of a playa wit paper dat dont show it
Screamin I got money but dont nobody no it
I work for it, so dat mean i got da right to roll twenties
And sag my jeans, da average gehtto childs dream
Turnin some cream and rollin vitwizy wil lizzy, why still hes a team
And seem ive accomplished dat
Bought a charm, went in a vice I took it back
When I return i want all my diamonds phat
I can't get off track
When my dawgs in my pack feel just like that
Look park your cadillacs ain't no time for stallin
While you penny pinchin playa i be out der ballin
