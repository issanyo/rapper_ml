[Chorus]
When you doin' better than niggas you better watch your back
You better watch your back, yeah
Niggas finna plot on you, you better not be conmfortable
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Stay on your toes, yeah yeah yeah
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Maino]
You doin' greater they'll hate ya
Look out for the friendly ones, cause they haters
It's no love don't expect that
They just layin' in the cut to get your neck snapped
That's why I ride with that Tec strapped
And I'm down to act dumb like I got left back
These niggas hate my ambition
Weak nigga wanna kill you over bitches
Eyes open no safe button
I just fucked a bitch outta Straight Stuntin'
Bad apple turned rotten on me
Shovel ready bury niggas that been plottin' on me

[Chorus]
When you doin' better than niggas you better watch your back
You better watch your back, yeah
Niggas finna plot on you, you better not be conmfortable
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Stay on your toes, yeah yeah yeah
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Lord forgive me, I'm 'bout to start killin' shit
Fully loaded M-16, what you dealin' with
Navy blue khaki suit, what I used to conceal it with
Know how many guns that a mil will get
You ain't gonna be satisfied 'till another nigga hit
I gotta overcome some bad runs, I lost a ton
Even found out the bitch that I was with, she was not the one
Baggin' up 8 balls with a plaque on the wall
Thinkin' how can I get this pack off to my dawg
Niggas gotta lot to say now
Ever since I let 'em see my AK slay now
31 in the clip, it hold 32
You better not let these pussy niggas murder you
Buck!

[Chorus]
When you doin' better than niggas you better watch your back
You better watch your back, yeah
Niggas finna plot on you, you better not be conmfortable
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Stay on your toes, yeah yeah yeah
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Nick Grant]
Listen hater don't take another step
Every word I utter classic, like the bubble Lex
Trouble yes
Tell me why they jealous like dead niggas watchin' the living
Take another breath, I'm not the one for stress
Tell her beat it like Stevie
Wonder if I'm the best, the game need me
Hero or heathen, either ain't easy
I believe it pays to be greedy niggas want you to starve
Rap Genius, but if I wasn't, shit I could get you robbed
Like my women off, drive me up the wall, small dark thing
Greek Goddess, swallow every drop of the offpsring
Even Goliath had fault with all the small things
Talkin' tough on the blogs, fuck what y'all think
Expose those who front, my book of flows
My 16s too sweet to sugar coat
Watch me carry my coast man it's all about respect
But still watchin' my back like it's eyes on my neck

[Chorus]
When you doin' better than niggas you better watch your back
You better watch your back, yeah
Niggas finna plot on you, you better not be conmfortable
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Stay on your toes, yeah yeah yeah
Stay on your toes, keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open, yeah yeah yeah
