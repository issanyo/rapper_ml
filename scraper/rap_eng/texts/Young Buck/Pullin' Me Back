Yeah it's me, Young Buck*
Get your cameras ready

[Chorus:]
I've been good int he Hood
Different shoot outs, the same shit
Bin a while since ya heard a buck album
It's just business, kept my distance
Now where the mutha fu-kers at, I gotta have em
Buck another album, pop another Valium
Roll another blunt get buck, I'm back
They pulling me back (5x)
Uhh yeah
Right now I need the media to just pay close attention
As I do me ni–as
Up until today, I still haven't heard a word from Dre
Or word from Em, I still fu-k with them
Me and Fifty ain't spoke and Banks ain't called
I ain't seen or ran into Yayo at all
But I'm out here, for whatever it's worth
My enemies asking me to sell em a verse
Huh, bury me alive, cover me up with dirt
You'll probably die trying to take your ass to church
Bandana check, 40 Glock check
I got stacks and AK's on deck
The spotlights all yours (do you) they all looking at you (go head)
And I ain't started on the first chapter

[Repeat Chorus:]
Pac rolling over in his grave
Looking at the way these rap ni–as behave
All these wannabe Kanye's
Bitches imitating Beyonce
Ni–as trying to fu-k Chris Brown ex fiance
Where the hell is Andre
At times like these we need all the MC's on the on tre
Rappers buy chains everyday, get vibe at the all star game in LA
Separate me from them, I am not him
Cut from a different clothe than your favourite rapper
This is called pain, watch what you take
Remember I ain't even started on the first chapter

[Repeat Chorus:]
[Young Buck: {Talking}]
Yeah you know who it is right
Swagga like no other nigga, it's just me my ni–a
I'm just saying ni–a, holla at me ni–a
I told you ni–as I was back on my Bucksh-t
Classic shit, big boy shit on the way
Matter of fact, only God can judge me...
