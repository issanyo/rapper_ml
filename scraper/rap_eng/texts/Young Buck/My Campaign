[Intro]
Hey Radio
If I had one wish right now
All I would want you to do is play this for me

[Verse 1]
I fell in love with this rap game and married it
Raised as a soldier
I put all of the weight on my shoulders for my city and carried it
False reported funds that they say that I inherited
Like I just jacked off millions and now I'm like "where it went?"
I know I'm one of the realest and I know this here is evident
Even through these hard times I remain relevant
You can't feed me peanuts, no I'm not an elephant
In fact I'm street certified and I'm quite intelligent
For real I know I'm heaven sent, this is why the devil sent
Everything the IRS done took it's like it never went
Rap has took my life and you should use this here for evidence
This is everything you go through when you're runnin' for president

[Chorus]
This my campaign
Let's do the damn thang
Party like we never partied in this thang before
I put this here on everythang
Took off like an airplane
You ain't gotta tell me when to go because I know
I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck

[Bridge]
You can say what you want, but you can't say I don't get up
And you can think what you want, but for sure you better run and put on
So shawty you can take it
Take it, shawty you can have it, all this money, I'm makin'
I'm different from the average, just party party hard now
I know where to start now, in ya Kanye voice scream Lordy Lordy Lord now

[Chorus]
This my campaign
Let's do the damn thang
Party like we never partied in this thang before
I put this here on everythang
Took off like an airplane
You ain't gotta tell me when to go because I know
I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck

I make em' H-A-T-E me, if you not P-A-I-D
I pay for your V-I-P, see this M-O-V-I-E
They kicked my door in, then I kicked your door in
They took all of my dough out so I'm bringing more dough in
Shawty keep that sympathy for that baby your taking care of
Anything they done and done did to me, now we are aware of
Ain't no rappers evicting me, you two you just don't compare
Nothing that you do can scare us, we gon' keep you in our prayers
Right now we wanna party, go shawty its ya birthday
I'm feelin' like Lebron when he put on Miami's jersery
There's bottles everywhere so just ah, (ah ah ah ah) if ya thirsty
Imagine how they feel when they try to do you the worst way
It's just not now I been a G from the first day
Nothing that no DJ or media did to hurt me
Back in 94' that's when I almost caught my worst case
And I ain't never went nowhere I'm still in my birthplace
My campaign

[Chorus]
This my campaign
Let's do the damn thang
Party like we never partied in this thang before
I put this here on everything
Took off like an airplane
You ain't gotta tell me when to go because I know
I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I guess right now I gotta get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck, I know right now they wanna get
Buck, buck buck buck, buck buck

Buck buck buck, buck buck
Buck buck buck, buck buck
Buck buck buck, buck buck
Buck buck buck, buck buck
