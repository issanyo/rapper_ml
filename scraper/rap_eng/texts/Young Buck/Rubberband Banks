[Chorus]
Even when they're tryin to hate
Even tryin to take me down
Even in a wrong little way
They can't stop me now

Rubberband banks
You know I keep my cash in a role
Rubberband banks
Rubberband banks
They knew I keep my cash in a role

[Verse 1]
Niggas is crazy
Get caught up trying to implicate me
I'm in my girlish nineteen eighty with my shit of sake
Used to play all together but lived on different sizes of the town
I pick up the pack you went to college but came back around
Remember [?] now you wanna work for me
But certainly this life ain’t you, this ain’t where you wanna be (for real)
All of a sudden you saying you wan’t a key
Well I don't wanna know about it I don't wanna see
However you go about it this ain’t no G.A.M.E
And is just you and us homie, ain’t no I and We
I went from balling to bankrupt back to balling again
My mama comes visit me in the pen
I whipe her tears and tell her baby (I’m oke)

[Chorus]
Even when they're tryin to hate
Even tryin to take me down
Even in a wrong little way
They can't stop me now

Rubberband banks
You know I keep my cash in a role
Rubberband banks
Rubberband banks
They knew I keep my cash in a role

[Verse 2]
I'm hoping soon that one day I can close these open wounds
I'm closing thumbs so be careful how you approach a goon
My enemy offered my partner his own record deal
That nigga changed but now we’re wondering what a record deal?
Sha Money bought this car for me now I be trappin nice
Probable the only rapper selling dope and rapping about it
Maybe if I was rich than I could go by laugh about it
But life is a bitch and all she must to know it have you got it?
I see these choppers in your videos but have you shot it?
You ever kidnapped your kinfolks and held them hostage
I went from balling to bankrupt back to balling again
My kids come see me in the pen I tell them chill (just listen)

[Chorus]
Even when they're tryin to hate
Even tryin to take me down
Even in a wrong little way
They can't stop me now

[Chorus]
Rubberband banks
You know I keep my cash in a role
Rubberband banks
Rubberband banks
They knew I keep my cash in a role

[Young Buck talking]
One time for everybody in the streets
Everybody that wake up, working 9 till 5
Doing what ever it takes to survive
In a way to get money, you know
If you got kids you really understand this right now
You know Rubberband Banks representing more then just flashing the money
