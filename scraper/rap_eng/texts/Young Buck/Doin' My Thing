[Young Buck:]
Yeah this that grown man shit right here
Lets go

[Chorus: Young Buck]
You can catch me with the top dropped bitch
Police know they can't stop this
I'm doin' my thang
Big chain with some rocks on my wrist
Let 'em hate yeah I know I got 'em pissed
I'm doin' my thang
Move 'em in
Move 'em in
Move 'em out
Move 'em out
Money (money, money money, money)
What its 'bout
I've been out here all day trappin' out the house
I am what you call dirty south
I'm doin' my thang

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
So ghetto, still in the projects
Hand on the metal, a nigga still robbin'
You ask how i'm doin', I say i'm all good
But my life been ruined, we livin' like we should
Take away the pain
Don't take away the game
Nigga got to kill me before he take away my chain
I'm still runnin'
And the rims still spinnin'
The work still comin'
And my whole team winnin'
While you ballin' on a budget
You ask what it cost
And I'm hollain' out "fuck it"
Then tell me who the boss
The crumbs, the bricks
The guns, the clips
The thugs, the pimps
The house, the whips
Yep, we can talk if the conversation worth somethin'
A little weed and Hennessey never hurt nothin'
On the real the homie thats still baggin' up grams
The nigga better know who I am
I'm doin' my thang

[Chorus: Young Buck]
You can catch me with the top dropped bitch
Police know they can't stop this
I'm doin' my thang
Big chain with some rocks on my wrist
Let 'em hate yeah I know I got 'em pissed
I'm doin' my thang
Move 'em in
Move 'em in
Move 'em out
Move 'em out
Money (money, money money, money)
What its 'bout
I've been out here all day trappin' out the house
I am what you call dirty south
I'm doin' my thang

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Shake it up, move it all around
Keep it movin' until you hear that rock hard sound
We be groovin' the freaks love the way we comin' down
They be like "Them boys be blowin' dro by the pound"
Ten cars, four trucks and a couple of Os
Put the bitches in the back, we don't love them hoes
Hit the switches on the back, make the front end hop
I got it lookin' like Crenshaw on my block
Now hold on homie bbbbbut wait 'till it get worse
I hear him stutterin' sssssayin' my verse
Come grab the wheel from me, i'm about to hang out the sunroof
And let these motherfuckers see a thug when he come through
I'm feelin' it
I got my Guccis on, killin' it
Game and Fat Joe don't know who they dealin' with
Let a nigga run up on me with the bullshit
I'm a show you niggas how to do this
I'm doin' my thang

[Chorus: Young Buck]
You can catch me with the top dropped bitch
Police know they can't stop this
I'm doin' my thang
Big chain with some rocks on my wrist
Let 'em hate yeah I know I got 'em pissed
I'm doin' my thang
Move 'em in
Move 'em in
Move 'em out
Move 'em out
Money (money, money money, money)
What its 'bout
I've been out here all day trappin' out the house
I am what you call dirty south
I'm doin' my thang
