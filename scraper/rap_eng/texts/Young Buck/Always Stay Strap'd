[Verse 1]
I'm in the kitchen, my wrist twisting, tryna profit off of this pie
Niggas tryna pay for the hit, scared to do it they cowards
I'm hanging off of this harley-davidson hollerin money and power
Street nigga gotta do the laundry, my money taking a shower
Humble nigga but these haters making me sour, by the hour
I come through knock ya shit down like the tower's, now its ours
I'm remixing taking ounces out of they pack cuz they cowards
We might take your shit then sell yo shit right back, don't doubt it

[Hook]
I gotta always stay strapped
I gotta always keep mine nigga
I gotta always stay strapped
I gotta always stay strapped
I gotta always stay strapped
I gotta always go blaow blaow
I gotta always stay strapped
I gotta always keep mine nigga

[Verse 2]
Its hot as hell in this project building, got the fan blowing in the window
Niggas fucked up, still getting yo dick sucked by crackhead Linda
The sign saying don't enter, until you get robbed and then you don't remember
I'm cooking up the soft sell the hard so hoe I'll be gone in November
In my garage we break it down and carve it, we gotta get what they put it in that that sender (?)
I want it all, they know I like to ball, and ain't no tellin what the mexicans send ya
I never did forget, I remember, ya'll tried to put a nigga name in a blender
I got a hunnid guns in this sprinter
And them goons behind me in a rental

[Hook x2]
