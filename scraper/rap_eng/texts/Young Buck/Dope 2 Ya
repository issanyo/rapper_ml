[Intro]
That type shit in the background, I know you got that Chauncey, right?
ATL Jacob
Man this cocaine done brought my career back
Ah Cash, you crazy nigga
That boy Cassius

[Chorus]
I been sellin' dope to your daddy
I been pushin' molly on your mama
I just throwed a brick at your sister nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Keep fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Ain't pullin' up nowhere without my draco nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma

[Verse 1]
I got a life sentence inside this Louis bag nigga
Ain't got no licenses, I'm ridin' with that bag nigga
Showed up with squares and I bought everything they had nigga
Jumped in that Rari with that raw and did the dash nigga
Cut that vacuum seal, make sure that pack is real
We don't have to steal, we might have to kill
I ziploc it up, I drop top it up
We are not in love, I taught her how to rock it up
I wear Nordstrom on these niggas, made 'em shop with us
I bought Porsches on these niggas, made 'em stock it up
Bitch I'm bossin' up, I done lost enough
I'm just saucin' up, I'm Rick Ross-in' up, trap

[Chorus]
I been sellin' dope to your daddy
I been pushin' molly on your mama
I just throwed a brick at your sister nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Keep fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Ain't pullin' up nowhere without my draco nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma

[Verse 2]
Wrist froze, thirty six O's
Let them bricks go, let that shit show
What they hit for? I say what they hit for?
Your baby mama counted you out, then let that bitch know
Rose gold, Cartiers on all my hoes
We on the road, cocaine stashed in all the doors
Sosa, servin' in my Gucci loafers
I do it for the culture, turn my eggs into a vulture
Rolls Royce Wraith, feel like Tay-K doin' the race
Trap, trap, re-up, all this shit goin' in my safe
These niggas want H, man some fakes
They had to let my plug go, they had no case

[Chorus]
I been sellin' dope to your daddy
I been pushin' molly on your mama
I just throwed a brick at your sister nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Keep fuckin' it up, comma after comma
Ain't pullin' up nowhere without my draco nigga
I'm fuckin' it up, comma after comma
