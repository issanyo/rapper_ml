[Hook]
I spent a band for my belt, I think I'm fly bitch
Bye bitch, you can't come if you can't buy shit (yeah)
You think she belong to you? I think that's my bitch (that my bitch)
I'm still lookin' for a shorty I can ride with
I tell her buss it down (buss it)
Buss it down (buss it, buss it)
I'm still lookin' for a shorty I can ride with
Li'l bit' now buss it down (buss it)
Buss it down (buss it, buss it)
I'm still lookin' for a shorty I can ride with

[Verse 1]
I got my Ruger and my Cougar, bit'
Moving bricks
With my new li'l bitch

[Verse 2]
I know that she a messy bitch, stress me bitch
Still my basic bitch

Hunnid rounds, ridin' 'round, with my military

[Outro]
