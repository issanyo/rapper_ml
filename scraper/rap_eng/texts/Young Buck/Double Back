[Verse 1: Young Buck]

Bunch of shooters in a Sprinter right behind me (we pull up)
I rather sell a brick before I let you sign me (trap, trap)
Fuck a rapper, in a trap is where you find me (you know where I'm at)
I've been baggin' on my ounce since I was tiny (fuck your shit)
I told my plug them lil two hundred cannot blind me (nah nigga)
And when I finish runnin' through, come and rewind me
Yo pull up over here without me niggas grimey (niggas grimey)
They might line you up thinkin' you tryna lie me (we ain't playin')
Poster with the chopper on a shoulder strap
You say you a shooter but we know you cop
They know how we do it, bitch you know what happ'
Pick you one and hit you one and once we finish that

[Chorus: Young Buck]

Let's double back, I'm reloding
Double back (SKRR, SKRR)
Double back, double back, double back, U-turn
Double back, double back
Double back, I'm reloding
Double back, Bitch I'm back
Double back, double back
This the shit that make you U-turn in the middle of the street
Hangin' of the window hittin' everything you see
Let's double back, double back
Double back, I'm reloding
Double back, Bitch I'm back
Double back, double back

[Verse 2: Young Buck]

My young nigga caught him one and lost his appetite
I looked at him in his eyes, said it's gon' be all right
He looked at me in my eyes said I can't sleep at night
Keep your mind on ya money that's gone keep ya right (aight)
Niggas takin' losses I've been pushin' nigga (I've been pushin')
I've been beefin' with some bosses, fuck them pussy niggas  (fuck them pussies)
And I know the streets is talkin', Bitch I hear they wisper (I hear you nigga)
It's some shit I won't acknowledge, I'm gon' read description
AR got the clip with the curve on it (one hundred)
Bunch of niggas smokin' weed, they got syrup on it
Pop a A, fuck a A, Pop a A, fuck a A
Now you can go and take my name and throw some dirt on it
My lil' partner caught him one and he havin' nightmare
He looked at me in my eyes and ask do I care
I looked at him in his eyes and told him not now
What we've done and I can't lie I left it right

[Chorus: Young Buck]

Let's double back, I'm reloding
Double back (SKRR, SKRR)
Double back, double back, double back, U-turn
Double back, double back
Double back, I'm reloding
Double back, Bitch I'm back
Double back, double back
This the shit that make you U-turn in the middle of the street
Hangin' of the window hittin' everything you see
Let's double back, double back
Double back, I'm reloding
Double back, Bitch I'm back
Double back, double back
