[Intro]

Damn,i remember we ain't havin no ice niggas
We had no cars , no money , no nothin'
Look at us now nigga

Lets take it back to my first gram
All i wanted was a oz
Sent me 3 wit' the big motor
Come through lookin' like a whole key
I'm going back to the old me
I'm turning back to the old me
And if niggas shooters we gonn' see

[Chorus]
Yeah i'm fuckin' wit' the work
Rich niggas doin' dirt
Mollie,Xans,and percs
Anybody get murked
I'm turning back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key
I'm rollin' round with a firearm
Pullin' up wit' a check
Standing ova this stove hoe
Everything's on deck
I'm going back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key

[Verse 1]
I'm sellin' weed with my nieces (family)
Breaking bricks down to pieces (yeah)
Breakin' all of my leases (damn)
Blue khakis with the creases
Arm wrest wit' the scales on it
Weight up i got no bags give me something i can put it on
Then you gonn put it in yo stash
Ash tray full of kush roach double cup full of high tech
Fo'real i'm high as i can get i'm suprised that i ain't dyin' yet
Rubber band on a bank roll , old money with a new bitch
I'm turning back to the old me but i'm pullin on that new shit
Pocket rockets in the club
Extendos in the parking lot, and i'm lettin that fire go
I dont care if its dark or not ,shoe box got a hundred in it
Bring it to ya and come and get it
I ain't trippin' my young nigga he hoppin' out and runnin with it

[Chorus]
Yeah i'm fuckin' wit' the work
Rich niggas doin' dirt
Mollie,Xans,and percs
Anybody get murked
I'm turning back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key
I'm rollin' round with a firearm
Pullin' up wit' a check
Standing ova this stove hoe
Everything's on deck
I'm going back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key

[Verse 2]
I drinkin' straight out the bottle
Dont give a fuck bout' tomorrow
Done ran out of love
Ain't got nothing you can borrow
I'm rollin up out the pound
I'm takin' trips out the town ][?][?][?]][?][?][?]][?][?][?]
White green and a brown
They pullin' up for no piss test
Ain't showing up for no court day
Catch me and imma flat mine ain't got time for no horse play
Glass house with the windows up stayin' down now niggas up
Reall niggas can't get enough the keep sayin' get em buck

[Chorus]
I'm going back to the old me
I'm turning back to the old me
And if niggas shooters we gonn' see
Yeah i'm fuckin' wit' the work
Rich niggas doin' dirt
Mollie,Xans,and percs
Anybody get murked
I'm turning back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key
I'm rollin' round with a firearm
Pullin' up wit' a check
Standing ova this stove hoe
Everything's on deck
I'm going back to the old me
Yeah i'm turning back to the old me
I'm breaking down this whole key
