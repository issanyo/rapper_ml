What up niggas It's Young Buck
Niggas know how I get down
I'm 'bout to take my show on tha road right now
So I will be coming to a hood near you niggas
Let's go
Haha
Straight up and down
See I come to spend money, fuck some of these bad bitches, come back get some mo money nigga let's go

[Verse 1:]
Everybody's lookin', like who da fuck is they?
His chain gon get tookin, he must don't know where he at
Da hoes know da swag, they see a new face
They see the Gucci bag and the Louis suitcase
The Marc Jacob glasses and baby brown shirt
Da only question da niggas ask is where dat work
I'm two steps ahead of these bitches and these feds
See I just want da bread, and dey just want me dead
So I don't go to bed, I be sleepin with my Nikes on, 3 am, all of the lights on, until the white gone
A pink Sprite and some pills called Supermans, you pop one and you fuck around and shoot yo friend

[Chorus:]
I know I'm not from round here, but you can bet
Got a bunch of killas with me, I got straps on deck
And I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
You think you finna rob me, (me?)jack who? (who?)
All this ice man you know I'm stayin strap, I got too
And I just might (Kill me a nigga)
I think I might (Kill me a nigga)

[Verse 2:]
I'm flyin out da mall, and fuckin with these hoes
I don't know where I'm at, I get off the plane and roll
They take me to the hood, show me where to get some soul food
I'm a show you love, even tho I don't know you
That don't mean I'm so cool, you can't get my jewels
I'm gone be like "Hey dude, please don't be no fool."
I let it go boom, fuck a rapper I'm a goon
And I'm the strapest nigga in this mothafuckin room
My shows look like gang meetins all these niggas bangin'
Da hoes know if they ain't freakin we gone leave em hangin
Respect anotha nigga city when ya out a town
You disrespect tha Ville round here it's goin down

[Chorus:]
I know I'm not from round here, but you can bet
Got a bunch of killas with me, I got straps on deck
And I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
You think you finna rob me, (me?)jack who? (who?)
All this ice man you know I'm stayin strap, I got too
And I just might (Kill me a nigga)
I think I might (Kill me a nigga)

[Verse 3:]
This stage too small, so I'm standin on da bar
Performin with my strap, I don't leave it in the car
I'm givin niggas dap, and da hoes get a hug
I hate it when niggas come to me rappin in tha club
I ain't actin fucked up, just think if you was Buck, and these rappers interrupt, while you getin your dick sucked
What tha fuck
All these bitches, and you on a niggas nuts
Well if you don't want the pussy we gone take it with us
The white get her right, yes, make her feal a rush
Let's party like we was on Lil Wayne's bus
Respect another nigga city like I do my own
You disrespect tha ville, bet you won't live long

[Chorus:]
I know I'm not from round here, but you can bet
Got a bunch of killas with me, I got straps on deck
And I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
I feel like I'm a (Kill me a nigga)
You think you finna rob me, (me?)jack who? (who?)
All this ice man you know I'm stayin strap, I got too
And I just might (Kill me a nigga)
I think I might (Kill me a nigga)
