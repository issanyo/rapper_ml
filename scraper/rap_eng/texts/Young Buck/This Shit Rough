[Verse 1]
I had a feeling niggas was gon be with this shit cause it was dry nigga
You take what you could get you gon sit there and just die
I Learned a long time ago get yo money never mind a ho
Got 10 years invested and yo bitch naked dick down the throat
Catch me dirty and trapping up until something occurs
And then there's spikes on my sneakers red on the bottom of hers
Nigga don't do nothing but do this
That's right nigga you clueless
But this only the way a street nigga can get through this
Meditating like a buddhist
Niggas cool but I'm the coolest
Take this cup and I'mma screw this
Tryna get money like I'm jewish
Who is this nigga think he is? just gone fuck all of our hoes
Put coke all in our city then just jump up and go
No! Truth is I've heard it all before
And ain't too much that you can say to make me wanna stop it though
I told my partner pushing a million dollars ain't enough
And ain't no dope out in this streets nigga ain't it rough

[Hook]
Big old chain on your neck and you just came just to flex
We just came just to come up then go hang in the jets
Let me get that drop it this shit rough
Let me get that drop it this shit rough
You got ice on your wrist and i got money in my mind
That mean I'm tired of being broke and you running out of time
Let me get that drop it this shit rough
Let me get that drop it this shit rough

[Verse 2]
Talk to me baby what is that pussy gone do for me
I buy you this bag is you gone shoot to me?
All this money coming honestly this shit is spooking me
Plus I ain't been seeing my kids like a do usually
Crackers asking who I am I tell them hoes just google me
Back this bently up excuse me can you move for me
Left all my feelings in my mama house came out like fuck yall
Everybody buying bricks everybody but yall
Let do it this is just a rapper, blood, don't let this niggas play you
Ungrateful ass bitch cause this the last time I save you
Keep tweeting all them lies
Like you really seeing them pies
And cookin' all that coke you a broke nigga in disguise
We laughing at you guys
And yall colombian ties
If I told you what your bitch be doin' you would be surprised
Hey lil buddy keep pushin' a quarter key ain't enough
And and ain't no dope in these streets boy you see that it's rough

[Hook]
