[Chorus](Sharron Sanders)
You might see my riims spiiinin

[Young Buck]

Im on my grind ain't no clubbin for me
Cuase lil groupie ass hoes mean nothin to me
I like chinchilla furs, cars and crocidiles
Similiar to jigga but my own lifestyle
I got a child so i ant really bout no games
Ive been all around the world and its al the same
If you ain't got monye you dam near dead
So we post on the block till we get us some bread
I ain't been home in 3 days or change my clothes
But i can reach in my pocket pull out a bankroll
A ballah baby i dont love these hoes
I hustle monday through sunday
My shop neva close
Thats why you see the ice on them chrome 24's
Cause im in the traphouse while 50 doin shows
Love for the rap game but live for the streets
What would you do if you was gettin? it cheap

[Chorus]
You might see myy riiims spiiinin
And all this big time and shinin'
Im postin up tonight
Lets get this money

Lets get this money
Lets get this money
Lets get this money

[Young Buck]

Brin it back if you takin to long
Im trying ot flip minds quick see my patience is gone
Let the lil homies take my cars to the club
And ima post right here, come show me some love
I got 2 for 1's cuase, 3 for the twenty
Im takin dimes, pennies or whatever that you give me
Gotta make it home so im checkin my rearview
These rappers ain't trappin
For real i still do
Captain of ship or ther kernal of the tank
Whatever that you cal me in money in da bank
Just playin my position liike a shoulder do
And it ain't no tellin what i sold to you
I told my girl hold on im tryin to get a lil bigga
You ain't feelin that go find another nigga
A money go-getter you gotta love me
Underground king like pimp c and bun b

[Chorus]
You might see myy riiims spiiinin
And all this big time and shinin'
Im postin up tonight
Lets get this money
Lets get this money
Lets get this money
Lets get this money
