Todays the day
My big release date
Terminate on sight
Fuck with, let's go

What the fuck are they gon' do now, do now
Do now, do now
Do now, do now
Ahh shit, they done kicked me out the crew now
Crew now, I'm cool now, cool now
I'm cool now, cool now

[Verse 1]
Just finished cookin' so the kitchen still stinkin'
Pounds in the trunk of the broke down lincoln
I'm on the scale weighin' watchin' BET playin'
With a big bank roll and some yayo in my hand like
Come and get it nigga, I can serve all y'all
Tell yo baby momma that I'm waiting on her call
87 32 David Brown T-Shirt
No G-unit Shoes cuz they make my feet hurt (ha ha)
Now who need work, 50 got me out here
Tax time coming, ima be on time this year
Nose running but I ain't snortin' nuttin'
I took a whiff of myself and I smell like money
Gucci down to the belt, all the bad bitches want me
When I leave what I left, they gon sell it out, sell it out
See in the south bitch I opened up the doors
Get your own paper Yayo, 50 money ain't yours

[Hook]
Talk about me bitch, Talk about me bitch
Talk about me bitch, Talk about me bitch
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, Let's get it

Talk about me bitch, Talk about me bitch
Talk about me bitch, Talk about me bitch
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, did I get it
But let em know, Let's get it

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck are you? homie speakin' on me
I can't pay for your love, unfortunately
But, you can come see that the kid getting dough
Driveway looking like a funk flex car show
Talk about me ho, I can't hear you no mo
I've been riding Southwest, now I'm flyin' G4
And I'm feeling so loyal, the hood riding for you
The haters just ignore you, my ho so spoil
He ain't never hit the bottom, he ain't never been on top
All I can see is I got em Jimmy, soon my album drop
Shawty miss me says she know my history
And she see the niggas try to cease and assist me
No, they can't deal with this so y'all go get 50
And we can play like you and Kanye, but he don't wanna go there with me
See in the west bitch I opened up the doors
Get your own paper banks, Curtis money ain't yours

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm gone make them niggas hate me (hate me)
G-Unit shouldn't try to terminate me (terminate me)
I'm gone make these niggas hate me (hate me)
G-Unit shouldn't try to terminate me (terminate me)
Feel like these pussy niggas gone give me respect
I feel like the whole rap game owe me a check
I know allot of people thinking that I know he stressed
Cuz I'm surrounded by myself, but I know me best
Bitch I'm protecting the south and I don't need no vest
Them hating words out your mouth makes me no less (respect this)
And I never ran from another man, got my balls in my hand like who the fuck are them
I'm the king of the city, best thing since Biggie (shawty)
Rub your titties if you love big poppa
See in the east bitch I opened up the doors
Go and get that money buck, all BooBoo money yours

[Hook]

Yeah, Young Buck bitch
I'm everywhere, they never there
I does this, Ca$hville I got us baby
