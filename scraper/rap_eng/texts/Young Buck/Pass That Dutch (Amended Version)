Misdemeanor on the floor, pretty boy here I come
Pumps in the bunk, make you wanna hurt something
I can take your man, I don't have to sex 'em
Hang 'em out the window, call me Michael Jackson, hehehe
I'm a pain in your rectum, I am that bitch y'all slept on
Heavy hitter, rhyme spitter, call me re-run
Hey, hey, hey, I'm what's happening (yeah)
Now to get my drink, that's right
Shake your ass till it stink, that's right
Mr. Mo's on the beat, that's right
Put it down for the streets, that's right

[Missy] (Young Buck)

[Missy] (Young Buck)
Number one, drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make you hump, bump, jump
If you's a fat one put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn (ah)
Oh my God, show 'em I'm large
Shove my beat up, attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
*car alarm* Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car, you will hear viper armed
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, come on and give me some applause
*applause*
Thank you, oh thank you, you all are so wonderful

[Missy] (Young Buck)

Throwback North Carolina, Jordan, yeah
Young Buck's a heavyweight
Because I handle my weight and I be carryin' weight now wait
Ok, the jump off jumped off
Play bullshit on the dancefloor, they run off
No dough, I got nothing to come off
Ok Miss, go and get your run off

[Missy]
Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going like the Energizer bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever your choice
Didn't come to judge, I cam to get you moist
Scream, whoo whoo, now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on a white horse *horse*

[Young Buck]
Young Buck playin' twister, not the game
But the same colors ain't what I'm twistin' man
I got a lot to go around
You gettin' it over and over and over till the sundown
Heavy breathing, cops chase me in a rundown
Flow heat, so they holler put the gun down
I'm like no, all I got is some goo-good
They like yeah we know you, you from the hoo-hood
I'm like sheesh, I be rappin'
They like, yeah we know a nigga from the alliance, take action
I know you hate me though
I'm with the only female in the game makin' Oprah dope
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
