(feat. 50 Cent)

[50 Cent:] Man I've been tellin niggas over and over
[Young Buck:] Ayo what up niggas?
[50 Cent:] Not to play with this nigga man
[Young Buck:] Ayo man? there be alot of niggas out here
Talkin about they got beef with G-Unit..
[50 Cent:] Shoot, stab, kill nigga
[Young Buck:] You know?
And I be seein' these niggas
I be by myself and shit niggas be like a hundred deep and shit..
I be like "Whats up nigga?"
[50 Cent:] Don't say I ain't tell you, I warned you
[Young Buck:] Niggas be like "Nah man it ain't like that"

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Look up its a full moon the sound of the winds blowin'
And you don't know you about to get killed but I been knowin'
The nights still young I might as well come around midnight
Just me all by my lonely my homies gon' sit tight
I'm working with a Glock and just a little bit of gas money
But bet I come back with what them niggas done snatch from me?
My crip and blood thugs want to get with ya
They mad at me cause i'm tellin' them "Its personal nigga"
I want to see
If this motherfucker want it with me
So on three
I'm a hop up out this SUV
If you around with 'em
I'm a feel like you down with 'em
So soon as this round hit 'em
You'll lay in the ground with 'em
Awakened by Satan but being carried by the Lord
What your life cost Bill Gates couldn't even afford
Ain't nothin' that can stop reprecussions if I die
This ain't got nothin' to do with Dr. Dre motherfucker, its you and I

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I dont need 10 niggas with me
I don't run and go get the police
(I will do it myself)
You know me
I'm a motherfuckin' G
If its beef bitch nigga we'll see
(I will do it myself)
Let 'em hate homie you know where I be
You done seen me get down on TV
(I will do it myself)
And I brought the whole Unit with me
But they already know how I be
(I will do it myself)

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
In the beggining I was humble
Just thankful for makin' it out the jungle
I've never ever said nothin' on this mic I didn't want to
I'm a soldier so soon as 50 give me a mission
I'm on my enemie's territory then play my position
And homie know me even that nigga thats wearin' ya chain
See we both from the south but homie we ain't the same
And I remain in the same fuckin' project buildings
I got guns everywhere bullet holes in the ceiling
My adrenaline pumpin'
Got this 12 Gauge dumpin'
Out the back of this Cutless
If I get hit up then fuck it (yeaaaah)
The Reaper comin' so don't look back just keep runnin'
Tell 50 for this hit I don't need nothin' "You owe me one"
Now show me son
And where he be at
Thats all I need to know, you can go i'm a be back
Any other time I probably would've asked Banks to ride
But this ain't got nothin' to do with G Unit nigga... just you and I

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I dont need 10 niggas with me
I don't run and go get the police
(I will do it myself)
You know me
I'm a motherfuckin' G
If its beef bitch nigga we'll see
(I will do it myself)
Let 'em hate homie you know where I be
You done seen me get down on TV
(I will do it myself)
And I brought the whole Unit with me
But they already know how I be
(I will do it myself)

[50 Cent:]
Yeah
Ya'll niggas know what it is man
G Unit South
Young Buck
I've been holdin..
I've been savin' ya'll niggas man
I swear to god
I've been savin' ya'll niggas
Over and over
I've been tellin' him "Fall back Buck"
"Dont cut these niggas, don't suit these niggas"
"Fall back, its not good for business"
Right?, but now i'm a let up off...

Fuck these niggas man

Whatever
You know what it is man
