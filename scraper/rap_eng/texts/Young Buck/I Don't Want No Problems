[Intro: Young Buck]
Aiyo Spider Loc
I know 50 told ya man
These niggas be beefin' with G Unit
But when we catch these bitch ass niggas it's a different thang
Come on west side

[Chorus: Young Buck]
When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobody's watchin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you bout it
Then say I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If its beef
Who 'gon take it to the streets
I ain't tryin' to hear that
I don't want no problems
Uh uh I don't want no problems

[Verse 1: Spider Loc]
I see you in the video lookin' hard
Catch you in my city I'm a pull your card
Better give G Unit full regard
Or I'm a take that bitch ass to the yard
Hook ass niggas just tickle me blue
Look at the gay ass shit he do
Wanna jump on the internet and cyber bang
Got the nerve to speak bad on Spider's name
I'm rider loco
You just you know oh so so definitely not in my class
Remember the last time I got that ass
I'm a gangbangin' nigga for real
And in the gang you a hard nigga to feel
West coast you know the nigga is ill
I'm EC Fif gave a nigga the scrill

[Chorus: Young Buck]
When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobody's watchin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you bout it
Then say I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If its beef
Who 'gon take it to the streets
I ain't tryin' to hear that
I don't want no problems
Uh uh I don't want no problems

[Verse 2: Spider Loc]
Its hard in the hood when you can't return
You talk too much why can't you learn?
I got too much Gank to burn
With the bullshit threats I ain't concerned
Be a man why don't you tell them the truth
Ya passive in person yell in the booth
Washed up through every thug in the book
Crossed between a thug and a hook
Something like that cause ya ain't no Crip
Ya crack on site you ain't 'gon trip
I'm a hog and a half I ain't 'gon slip
Cut out the actin' this ain't no script
You can feel when this shits for real
What a nigga don't know 'till he hits his grill
I guess he do I cut the squabbin'
Look he like "Dude I don't want no problem"

[Chorus: Young Buck]
When them haters start talkin' and them pistols start poppin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
Catch these niggas in the club when they think nobody's watchin'
They like I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If you scared say you scared don't be actin' like you bout it
Then say I don't want no problems
Nigga I don't want no problems
If its beef
Who 'gon take it to the streets
I ain't tryin' to hear that
I don't want no problems
Uh uh I don't want no problems
