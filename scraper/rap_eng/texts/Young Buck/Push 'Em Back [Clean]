It's about to go down
Get out the way, get out the way
Better move, it's about to go down
Get out the way, get out the way
You better move 50 feet, shawty, let a **** through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Ain't nobody goin' broke, everybody sellin' ****
Everybody gettin' money, it's some **** tellin' no
We ain't talkin' on the phone, I don't know ya, I ain't **** ya
Nobody never heard of ya, you're **** wit' some ****
Look at my wrist, look at my ****
She hold daddy down, help a **** get rich
This patron got me hot, the Phantom in the lot
See this **** kickin' in and I'm standin' wit my Glock
In this **** like move, I need some elbow room
Got me spillin' liquor, why the club close so soon?
Burn this **** up, we 'bout to get Buck
Gimme a light, tell the DJ, turn my **** up, it's on now
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a **** through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway

Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Cup fun of Hennessy, my **** call it Gasoline
**** **** fill up and say **** they don't mean
Stuntin' wit cha real money that'll get chu ****
See probably want this paper, my baby needs some milk
**** we built this city, the **** boy committee
I still got the **** to saddle up and come and get it
A product of the projects, my momma's only son
Made my first million dollars and a new drama would come
Didn't run from it, I ran to it
I'm not playin' 'bout the Unit and my fans knew it
Now make a lane for me 'cause I deserve this
I wonder what my enemies get when they heard this
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a **** through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me ****
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me ****
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me ****
You don't want no problems, you don't wanna see me
Got a **** **** **** **** **** **** **** wit me
If a mother**** hit me, I'ma knock his head off
I ain't scared of none of y'all, ****, I'm runnin' from the law
Put your **** fingers up if you will knock they head off
Pushing **** all through the state
It's like I speed up when they tell me, "Pump my brakes"
If I told you what I make every time I flip a ****
You would prolly try to take the same trip that I take but you can't
Gimme 50 feet, shawty, let a **** through
If you don't wanna move, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Get out my way, we ballin' like hey
I'm throwin' money, I can't take it wit me anyway
Make the club push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
Push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em back
