[Intro]
Tony Ron said bring the prep back, haha
Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Shawtay! What you mad for?
I don't know too many, that go to sleep in Chanel and wake up in Fendi (aight)
You knew what it was, before ya hopped inside my Bentley (what)
And everything was good as long as I kept spendin' (yeah)
But I'ma keep it hood, see you I can do without it
You wonder why we call you bitch, think about it
Go holla at ya man maybe he can support ya (haha)
Love don't live here I ain't got nothin' for ya

[Verse 2: Lyfe Jennings]
First things first, girl stick that attitude, in your purse
Straighten up your face before I, pull over
Ain't nothin cute about walking, home from work, check yourself
Now number two, your my only lady baby, that's the truth
So you can sit and pout until your, face turn blue
I'll kill a brick and drown a drop, what about you
But there's one thing I can't do

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings & Young Buck]
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
You my one and only, I ain't tryna mess around
You just trippin', you gots ta slow down, slow down, slow down
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
You my one and only, I ain't tryna mess around
You just trippin', you got ta slow down

[Verse 3: Lyfe Jennings]
When I was just a tyke, brother taught himself how to, ride a bike
It took a couple scrapes and cuts to, get it right
But once I got the hang of it, I rode all night, I said that to say
This rela-tionship is gonna have it's, good and bad days
It's like falling off and getting back, on again
But no poppin' wheelies 'til we, got our balance
I can't handle this

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings]
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
You my one and only, I ain't tryna mess around
You just trippin', you gots to slow down, slow down, slow down
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
You my one and only, I ain't tryna mess around
You just trippin', you got ta slow down

[Verse 4: Doc Black]
What up with all these allegations, shorty all is well
Accusations about my situation, callin' my cell
Take a step back, relax, chill, pause exhale
You the reason why I ain't got no bars on my cell
But you'd be happy if, I was behind bars in a cell
You must think I'm in this booth, spitting these bars for my health
For every action there's a reaction, cause and effect
Good times and bad times, whatever cards is dealt
You need some help cause I

[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings & Doc Black]
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
Yo Lyfe, help me out on this one man, I can't force 'em to slow down, slow down, slow down
Can't force you, to slow down, slow down, slow down
Slow down

[Outro]
Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings, Jesus Swings
