[Lloyd Banks]
YEAH! Uhh, I'm back
Uhh, haha
Uhh, oooooooh

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah yeah, they know me 'round here, they call me Iceman
I ain't your friend boy, I'll fuck your wife man
Look at my left, now look at my right hand
Every time I move it looks like a strike of lightning
My name is Banks, but you can call me Igloo
There's white rocks on my neck, and my wrist's blue
So don't trip, cause you know I got my pistol
You'll be surprised of the doors that it gets through

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, Louie introduced me to jewelry, now I'm lovin it
Tell Jacob the shinin's so good, them hoes love the shit
Diamond after diamond, and I climbed up out the bottom
So holla if it's a problem, I got 'em just like you got 'em
I'm stylin; they grillin cause my whip can buy a skyscraper
Roll down the windows stick my hand out, "Hi hater!"
I'm on my way to L.A., I'll see you guys later
You'll be here when I get back; ain't got no time to drink that
Now all I do is sit back, hop on the plane and sip 'gnac
Hop in the Range and whip that, came in the game with this crap
You say my name you get smacked, right on your brain with the gat
Know who you playin with Black, then holla back

[Young Buck]
My name is Buck, but you can call me Icey
I keep spillin Cristal on my white T
Don't give a fuck, bitch you ain't gotta like me
I pop my trunk and have you runnin in your Nikes
Look what I just bought, this white mink I got it in New York
And this bright link I put it on and walk right out the store
Where's my car keys? What am I gon' drive?
My Phantom got the steering wheel on the wrong side
Pocket full of cash, Ferrari with the drive-out tags
Them hoes followin us, let me stop and get some gas
Liberace, the cops watch me
I'm ice skatin like a nigga playin hockey - holla back

[Hook]

[8Ball]
Canary yellow princess cut, rocks when I smile
Fat boy kept it gritty since I was a chubby child
Look at me now, hat cocked up, wristwatch rocked up
When I put my hand up to my mouth and hit that sticky stuff
The light, hit the ice, on my eight-ways piece
In the streets, I'm a G; on the mic, I'm a beast
Keep a bitch, on her knees, nigga please, I'm a pimp
Purge first, ask last, I'm a shark, you a shrimp
Check a deuce, Chevrolet, rims taller than my son
Gun, on the seat with a extra clip cause I ain't fin' to run
In my brand new, shell toe, three stripe, all white
In other words, come my way with that shit you gon' lose your life

[Hook]

[Scarface]
What the fuck are they yellin?
Dope man, anybody killa in the hood, fuck the homeboy sellin
I've got a problem with him - if I can't touch it
Then he can't slang it, and these streets get dangerous
Corny niggas pull up in cargo vans
Palms sweaty, icky's out with they masks all mad
I gave 'em the order, and that's all bad
Born into flossin flashin got his mark-ass, smashed
The Iceman is in the buildin chillin
Big game huntin; and this lame's, stuntin
Got an addiction that's deeper than a prescription
He's sleepin I'm on a mission to beat him in my position
It's fucked

[Hook]
