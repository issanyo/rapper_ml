[Intro: Young Buck]
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me)
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me)
Aw you ain't never been to the Dirty Dirty befo'

[Hook: Young Buck]
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
My 24's spinnin, the sticker still on 'em
The same ol' hoes, but a nigga still want 'em
I'm parking lot pimpin, on another nigga woman
She pullin up her skirt, tryna show a nigga somethin
The car cloudy, my niggas all rowdy
This Hennessey den got a nigga drowsy, I'm outtie
Now where them hoes at, look I'm tryna take you home
So what you got ya girlfriend's, bitch bring 'em on
Oh I'm tryna break a bone, when I get in them drawls
To the window! - to the mothafuckin walls
What a nigga don't know won't hurt him
So if you got a old man, bitch I ain't worried
And I got plenty room, if you think you wanna roll
See this is what they made Cadillac Trucks fo'
Let's go, to a place, you ain't been down in the country
I bet I have you sayin, you love me

[Hook: Young Buck]
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
My shorty wanna ride

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
My chain gotta brain, the liquor gotta right
It's aight cause, you could be my wife, but only for tonight
Get ya ass on this bike, I could show you I'mma rider
The 600 Coupe, wit the ol' school wider
Giovanni rims, wit Perelli's on the tires
They said 22's wouldn't fit, but they liars
We could take a trip to the hood and back
And we could go and get a room, how hood is that
What'cha waitin on shorty, this a chance of ya ife
What I mean, what I see, in them jeans, what I like
You don't know what you missin, just quit talkin and listen
See I'm holdin up traffic, we just right here sittin
Think about it for I bounce, and you holla I'm wrong
And you see ya best friend, in this Impala on chrome
If you ballin, and ya money long, you can relate
But all them broke ass niggas gon' hate

[Hook: Young Buck]
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low
Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me)

[Bridge: Young Buck]
Make it bounce if you want too, freak if you want too
G-Unit in this bitch all daaaay (What you gon' do)
Buck if you bout that, I could make 'em bounce back
G-Unit in this bitch all daaaay (Where the South at)
Bounce if you want too, freak if you want too
G-Unit in this bitch all daaaay (What you gon' do)
Buck if you bout that, I could make 'em bounce back
G-Unit in this bitch all daaaay (Where the South at)

[Hook: Young Buck]
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) we can get low

Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now

Hop into the Chevy fo' do', blow dro
Wanna ride wit me (ride wit me) let ya hair down
You said you wanna thug, don't be scared now
Shorty wanna ride wit me (ride wit me)
