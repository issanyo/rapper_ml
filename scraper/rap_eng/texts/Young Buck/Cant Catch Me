Aye Sticks, what up, homie?
Aye man, I know you see these niggas, man
They taking my swag
They taking my ideas and everythang, fuck 'em, yeah

These rap niggas ain't gettin' no money
I got my hands in everythang
If I can't get it over here
I'ma get it over there

I be flying down the interstate, trunk full of snowflakes
100 miles an hour, Lamborghini got no brakes
Navigation got me, crackerz tryna hide me
Niggas won't allow me, these hoes tryna fire me

Car so dark with the foppin' san tents
Jeezy say I'm goin' hard, yeah, I got to pay my rent
All my homies on a yard and I might be goin' in
So I give my lawyer ten, like every now and then

Keep a ounce of that granddaddy when I'm in my ten Caddi
Young nigga, old money, bitch, you know I been had it
Catch me with my roof back, birds on tha back seat
Mr.i65, come holla at me

Ghetto hero, I'm hood rich
Fuck rap, I got dough money, bitch
And I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I won't let them catch me

Street nigga and I'm gettin' rich
Fuck you, I got dough money, bitch
And I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I won't let them catch me

You ain't neva seen a Phantom with so many stashed products
Bought a crib in Atlanta 'cause the village gettin' hot
You can catch me in the hood in them dough boi spots
Every time I leave the kitchen I go buy another watch

Bad bitches shop, lil' homie get the drop
I change my name to King David, I'm the boss of the block
All that snitchin' tend stop soon as I kill me a nigga
And I know you probably gon' sue me so look he gon' deal with cha

Got my Louie bag filled up, take me where to get it
Niggas still tryna do it but we already did it
I'ma run this bitch hot, homie, just give me a minute
If my album don't drop, you could go 'head and get it, yeah

Ghetto hero, I'm hood rich
(Uh, huh)
Fuck rap, I got dough money, bitch
(Uh, huh)
And I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I won't let them catch me
(Uh, huh)

Street nigga and I'm gettin' rich
(Uh, huh)
Fuck you, I got dough money, bitch
(Uh, huh)
And I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
I bet cha can't catch me
(Uh, huh)
I won't let them catch me
