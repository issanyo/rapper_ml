(Lil Wayne)
Yea Now Weezy had a state of mind
And you ain't had shit until you had a plate of mine
Hit the top so quick forgot i came from the bottom
From the dirty but I'm like a shit stain on the Prada
And Nino couldn't do it but then Wayne hit the cotta
Obuituary Wayne i put ya name in the collumn
Them niggas ride tonight but, Then they change in the mornin I get em off my side like love handles, drug scandals
And what have you, but i ain't trippin
I had some pussy wet niggas round me but i ain't slippin
No homo, them niggas ain't reala then my grandma
Got that thrilla in my pocket and I'm feelin like shomo
Come omon a nigga want that cake make a funnel
If you ain't on my team get the fuck from out my huddle
I know I stink because I come from the gutter..
Yeaa but I'm above ya.. BUCK EM
