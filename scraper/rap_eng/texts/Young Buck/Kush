[8Ball]
Tastes like ? when you hit it
Gotta have bread to get it
Blow that shit, light that shit
Smoke that shit, hit that shit
Bag of kush cost 16 ?

[Kia Shine]
Shine is a hustler and what I sell
Is that hip-hop
My music is my dope, that's why
I put my discs in ziplocks
Respect my grind, I'm on night and day
Tryna get that dough
Like Ice Cube, I'm pushing weight
Every verse is a quarter, every song is an ounce
16's on this, sixteens on ok? My kush CD a pound
Get up and zip it in the streets and flip it
The time I ship it to the best store
That a nigga dun seen in the streets of Memphis
Shine out of Memphis, ? jones
And he got that pimp
He spit it so different
Yet it still is so pimpin: that boy got that gift
That boy got that good
And it's in your hood
Nothing but the best shit
You can buy ? like Memphis
I got that good..

[Hook]
I'm so fly, I'm so fly, I can fly..
I'm so high, all I see is the sky

[8Ball]
In the streets these thugs they hate me
Cause I stand so tall
I got DET under my stunnas
Smelling like dro
Cigarillos I stuff em
I like em heavy like my belly
I'm rolling and tippin with bitches
Smoking out my Chevy
Kush and the purple and Diesel
She say that is tastes like fruit
She say she don't really smoke and
Every time she hit, she choke
Puffin and passing and laughing
We ashing through ATL traffic
Look around, we downtown
Fuck around, they hit that magic
Eyes tight, head swoll, we so blowed man
Ashes shaking, look at them bitches!
Throwing money, make it rain
Chicken wings shots of Patron
Straight to my gut, straight to my dome
Can't walk, can't talk
And nigga I'm still finna drive home!

[Hook]

Whoa, whoa, whoa the dro
Puff puff pass, burn it slow
One to the head when I get out the bed
That granddaddy you already know
Bob Marley with the black Harley
You don't smoke? I'm so sorry
? Ain't no kush ain't no party, go shawty!
On it, ? hit that shit you said you want it
Gimme that shit my bread is on it
My kush tastes good, don't it
T-shirt, like "Wow!"
These people love my style
Before I stepped my game up I had to change up
Bought me a pound
Money, get up
That's the reason I ain't running with em
Post in the projects get it regardless
Wait on my cell: I'm coming to get em!
I'm so fly, I'm so high
Cut my break, I'm feeling myself
I just Wow, this is Wow!
We smoke til there's nothing left

[Hook]

[Kia Shine]
Now I know you think it can't get no better, right?
Bring them horns, bring them horns..
Give up! Give up!

Ooooooweeee!
I wanna thank y'all for listening to Tennessee's finest
I wanna introduce y'all to my band
My horns section our of ATL, go by the name of Jazz Bass
Tony Rich, streetknocker on drums
I wanna thank the city of Cashville and my guy Young Buck
For helping me out on this joint
And of course I can't forget the living legend 8Ball
And Memphis Tennessee.. yeah..
You know I go by the name of that kinfolk
Kia Shine
Once again, this is Tennessee's finest
Until we smoke again, y'all be blest mayne
Thank y'all for coming out, goodnight
