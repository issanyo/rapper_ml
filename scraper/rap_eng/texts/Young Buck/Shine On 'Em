[Intro:Bleu Davinci, DJ Drama]
Put the ground beneath your feet cuz
Go out on a blaze if you royal if you got ???
(It's 'bout that time!)
Straight up!
(Bleu Davinci, DJ Drama; Gangsta Grillz you bastards!)
(We got London on da Track!)

[Hook: Bleu Davinci, Sosay]
These niggas keep lookin', lookin' all crazy
(Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!)
My shooter got shooters, they ain't never gettin' laid
(shoot 'em, shoot 'em, shoot 'em, bweh!)
These niggas lookin' shook, betta' keep watchin'!
(Money! Money! On it, Yea!)
I shine on the p*ssy, ain't no stoppin'!
(Hol' up, Hol' up, Hol' up! Yea!)

[Bleu Davinci: Verse 1]
These niggas keep lookin', go, git dustin' (?!?)
Yea that nigga, nah don't trust 'em
Nigga in the trap, gittin' that guap
Go n' drop yo money then break the fuck out
Nigga gettin' paid, nigga gettin' dough
Nigga fuck around here, nigga get smoked
Nigga ride cars, nigga ride Benz
That's my hitta right there, career
I don't give a fuck 'bout what a talk
Pussy ass nigga keep talk, get dropped
Never really cared 'bout a bitch-ass cop
Feds on the tail, let 'em hoes watch
Niggas on Xan', niggas on lean
Four hun' for the shoes, eight hun' for the jeans
Juss came from the west with the fire-ass green
Finna fuck the city, let 'em cop.... seventeen
Pussy-ass nigga keep lookin' all cra(z)y
My nigga whickin' shit, doin' no playin'
Stick come out and the stick be sprayin'
What a nigga talkin' what a nigga be layin'
My shooter got shoot, my trappers got trap
These fake ass dopeboys really juss rap
My niggas gettin' money, you niggas know facts
Keeping lookin' all crazy, get your rear pushed back
