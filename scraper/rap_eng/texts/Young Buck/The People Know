"[?]" "What's that?"
"One of these days, your wise mouth is gonna get the rest of your body in a whole lot of trouble"

[Intro: PEZ & 360]
Uh, Forthwrite
Six–sixty and PEZ (Every now and then)
X & Hell (Yeah) (Every now and then)
A-Style, Forthwrite ([?])
Scar-non (This is how [?])
Uh

[Pre-Verse: A-Style]
My brain eases, I freeze frame in–uh
My brain eases, I freeze–uh–uh
My brain eases, I freeze fr–rhyme
Release on a beat–keep change–my mind

[Verse 1: PEZ]
My brain eases, I freeze frame in a rhyme
Try release on a beat but I keep changin' my mind like
Despite the deckin' and hope that I wreck it at shows
Met with consecutive debt, left to the beggars in row
Set and I'm lettin' you know, fightin' a feud
Only few on a mic fine with a mind frightened to prove
What I write nightly to youse, hidin' inside
Gotta move it aside, sights on the right cypher to choose to
Try to [?] soothin' in sight, hypin' the youth
That in my eyes or they might try to refuse
I'm sick of the way, shit, we're given a day
When I sit and give it a play, I'm thinkin' I wish I could [?]
And if we break down this hate crowd
A playground, play my fakes, proud to shake your way out
My aim now is keep on walkin' away
I see more and I form support towards enforcin' a change (Yeah)

[Chorus: 360 & PEZ]
Yeah, this is my time now
Kickin' you the shit to get you [?] right now
You know, no? No, we need to show
That you might not hear us speakin' but the people know (Yeah)
Yeah, this is my time now
Kickin' you the shit to get your mind right now
You know, no? No, we need to show
That you might not hear 'em speakin' what they're thinkin' but the people know

[Verse 2: 360]
I'll be on the stage, just walkin' around
And to get my point across, yo, I'll talk to the crowd
See, I see a lot of dudes are awfully proud
But when it comes to an opinion, yo, they water 'em down
And I think the heads inside the scene should grow with the times
Instead of makin' shit that's old and nobody likes
Supportin' Aussie hip-hop was a slogan in time
"Support the good hip-hop" is a slogan of mine
Uh, maybe let some light in, open your blinds
Realise there's no god around to show you a sign
Focus your mind kid, you know that it's time, quick
Float to the sky, open your eyes like this
Do you really think they told you the truth?
Nah, you only believe them 'cause they're older than you
So the evidence proves my destiny never can lose
And every possession I kept is a legacy too
What?
