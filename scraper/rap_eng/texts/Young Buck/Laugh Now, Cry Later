[Intro]
You look all around the world, it's the same shit
I mean niggas tryna eat, and it's drier than a motherfucker out here right now
But real hood niggas hold it down no matter what, ya heard (yeah!)
See the thing about a real nigga is
Whatever a bitch nigga do he could never stop that real nigga
See we should stand up for the haters right now
Because those bitch niggas make the world go 'round (Hahaha!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you ain't gotta fuck with me cause I ain't fuckin' witcha
I'm ridin' dirty with this work and my mother picture
40 cal. under my shirt and another pistol
Fuck a friend, all of ya'll can come and get your issue
Phone calls from the pen real niggas witchu
They say they shed a couple tears cause a nigga miss you
Avoiding hoes, no award shows
They been askin' where that boy go
Can he even pay his taxes?
Only lord knows what he do to get his dough
Let 50 tell it Buck is jealous and the nigga broke
But we just seen him man, we hearin' what the nigga wrote (hey!)
That nigga ballin' even if he is sniffin' coke (fa' sho)
They prayin' on my downfall tryna say I'm broke (fuck!)
But what a nigga come from I don't think they know (nah)
Pussy niggas in the game and they turned on me (turned on me)
For the money and the fame, you gon' learn homie
I pray to god for these...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch I was fuckin' her when you was fuckin' him (Haha)
If you don't wanna fuck with me, then ho fuck you then
Dope boy on the streets hustlin' again
You pussy niggas wanna beef, we can get it in
Black tall, hair wall, where your bangs at?
Hit you with this shit and show you why he came back
Hangin' out of the window bustin' on the freeway
I'm with my homie it was his quarter key Quay
If Obama got a plan, nigga where it at?
Cause it's a drop and don't nobody know where it's at
But in the south what we lose, we just get it back
We listen to Scarface, he motivate blacks
Then we make stacks
And Fuck a cop, they can die too
Before you hide me bitch, we gon' hide you
These rappers don't fuck with the streets like I do
It's all good, I'mma still stand beside you
I ain't no...

[Verse 3]
Don't look at me cause I ain't givin' niggas nothin' else
Show 'em love then they leave me by my fuckin' self
My heart cold and I know it'll never melt
I just gotta play the cards that a nigga dealt
?
Ridin' dirty in a rental with the wrong tags
Presidential in the gutter when they doin' bad
Concentrate on what I got, fuck what I had
Dirty south is on top and some niggas mad
Go take a trip to the fields and you can get your swag
Yeah I'm glad they done kicked me out the fuckin' group
Cause now the world see that I'm the motherfuckin' truth
Got the streets like, damn homie what happened to you?
I bet this conversation now they probably tappin' it too
I get paper
If you so major
Your team ain't shit without the number one playa!
(We know that you're all)

[Hook]
