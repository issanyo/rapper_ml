I remember them USP lockdowns, nights in the feds just staring at my cell walls
Them bitches done cancelled the visits and cut off the phones so now I'm waiting on mail call
I seen niggas lose they mind off doing that time real shit I'm trynna tell yall
So I thank that God my mind never fell off, I came home and picked back up where I left off
What im saying is I'm back on my feet, yeah they done let a real nigga back on the streets
Lock me in the booth and turn back on the beat, most these rappers is weak they not snapping like me
I really moved weight, through states, false spot I'm in the suitcase how im packaging keys
I be in the whip with the shotgun riding shotgun with the pump in the passenger seat
Only thing I know is stack and get cheese, niggas been getting taxed so they happy I'm free
I just stay humble my actions will speak
And the niggas who doubted now actually believe
Cause I was trynna put the city on the map, really living what I rap so they came to indict me
When I went away they opened they eyes and realize there will never be a nigga like me
They think they cold as December, but fuck all that shit imma show em sicker
Rest in peace Nupin, you gone and I miss ya so it's only right I put on for my nigga
I put my heart in every tape that I drop, im a real street nigga did my thing on the block
Ya bitch I'm back, ain't no taking my spot, y'all can't stop me so watch me go straight to the top


(CHORUS GUTTA GAMBINO)


First they show you love, then these niggas hate
I still kept it real while these niggas fake
I know some people wonder how much can I take
I'm a real nigga I'll Neva Break
They thought it was over for me when I caught that case
Niggas wanna wear my crown, trynna take my place
Key to the city name carry weight
I'm a real nigga I'll Neva Break


(YOUNG BUCK VERSE 2)

Country nigga got cocaine on the prison yard like fuck it
And I'm right where the dope dealers are real street nigga still touching
Still pullin up in them buckets, police pull up tell my bitch tuck it
I got a half a brick in this halfway house and you niggas better not say nothing
Soon as I touch the ground a nigga shook the town broke niggas still make me sick
Call lil Bubby, then text K Fresh, tell Gutta Gambino Let's get it
Really got my momma pulling up in the Honda she really be with the shit buying six bricks
My daddy sell dog food he won't even call you he be really on that old school shit
I got work and I work like a slave
I go purp but this pills keep me paid
I go to church but still tote AKs
I got 6 shots in the 12 gauge
I lost 10 blocks in the drug raid
Bagging pounds up since the 10th grade
Gutta bitch quick with the switch blade
Fuck yall yall niggas bitch made

(GUTTA GAMBINO VERSE 3)

Really niggas waiting on me, fuck niggas hating on me, everybody talk since I'm fresh up out of jail
Still living straight off cake from 08 I ain't even got to touch what I made in 20 12
Plug thug I'm pump pounds for cartels big shit they come around with all bales
My spot gonna shutdown where yall sell, niggas know I touchdown to cause hell
Been getting it in since the sandbox, fuck the damn cops like the one on sandlot imma big dog
Thousand 8 gram blocks,  welcome to my head lock, I been in the damn spot gettin bricks off
Stacking 50 grand knots wrap em up till the rubber band pop getting mine better get yalls
Still keep the can cocked with the lead shots, man I handle the damn rock like Chris Paul
Yeah I just came home, but I still get em gone, back on getting to the money asap
I stay strapped like air force ones, got air force guns bitch nigga I don't play that
You'll never find another nigga like me, you got a better chance trynna find a needle in a haystack
They took C and the T out of Covert they thought it was Over but watch how I shake back
