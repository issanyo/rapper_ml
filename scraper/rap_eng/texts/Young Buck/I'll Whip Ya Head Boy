I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

Two niggas in the front, two niggas in the back
That's four niggas riding strapped in grandpa's Cadillac
The voice in my head say fuck all these niggas
Then I start thinking, I should rob all these niggas

Man my homies they want do whatever I want do
I say I want eat they say shit we want eat to
Let's ride around find a nigga stunting on first street
With the shine's on niggas be looking like lunch meat

I run up on a nigga, pop one on the floor
Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start popping some more
Fuck a ski mask, man niggas know who I is
I got a full clip and niggas know I get biz

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'm up early in the morning, tryna make a move
You coming in here with me shorty take your lil' one to school
Even though she cause the drama, you love your baby momma
I hit her with the lama to get this cake

Give us the coke, the cash, the combo to the safe
Oh, she don't know it, damn, okay we'll wait
I play with your kid on the couch, while your bitch on the phone
With a gun to her head saying, "Daddy come home"

You was rolling, popping bubbly, didn't think it get ugly
In the hood shit is lovely until it go bad
Now you can pray for a miracle and God might be hearing you
And the nine will jam, right in my hand

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I got his homies screaming buck you need to calm down
Niggas be getting killed every time you come around
We ran up in his crib made his momma kiss the ground
She asking God, what my baby dunn did now?

I'm taking every thang, jewelry I want it all
Duck tape him up, rip the phone cords out the wall
Fuck waiting we can starting waiting on tomorrow
So ask Satan if he got a car that I can borrow

I'm impatient like a money hungry rap star
I jack him for his chain and I can get a new jaguar
The mack I have his brains all over the fucking sidewalk
And I'ma be on CNN again it ain't my fault
March nigga step, right nigga lef'
G-Unit soldier I'm thugging till my death mothafuckas

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed

I'll whip ya head boy, you know I will
I'll whip ya head boy, with the back of the steel
I'll whip ya head boy, your cap could get peeled
I'll whip ya head boy, your ass could get killed
