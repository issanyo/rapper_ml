[Intro]
I'm bout to run me up a check again
Thank the Lord, I just met another Mexican
What it do, I've been paying the same price as you
Bitch go do something about it
If you don't like it too

[Verse 1]
We traffickin
I take an Uber, bring it straight to ya
I got shooters who gon shoot it out with the state troopers
Carbon with the cooler, dress in black, go get the mula
Still I pull up and pick up the pack, don't let me fool ya
I'm rockin Givenchy in these trenches, nigga
I put insurance on the bags that they sent me, nigga
I know the lil nigga that ran off with that sack
I know them people too, that mailed his head back
I can't wait to open this (trap)
There's so much dope in this (trap)
I got about a million on me, hope that they don't notice this (trap)
I know a green thumb whiteboy who just growed us this
You done changed my whole life boy
When you sold us this

[Chorus]
Let's throw a bottle party
Feel like Pablo in these projects
Party, party, party, like Chapo got out, bitch
Loco, loco, loco, we got coco
Only real niggas in my photo
Only real killas in my photo
Only real trappas in my photo
Loco, loco, loco, we got coco
Only real plugs in my photo

[Verse 2]
Narco, narco, narco, we got cargo
Cheech, he just go get the yayo, that's Amado
I got the 18-wheelers rolling, full throttle
I got him [?] he lost his collar
Niggas been warrin lately
Territor-in lately
I've been in somebody bitch kitchen goin crazy
I've been on somebody block sellin 400 maybe
I'm making sure niggas get shot that do not pay me

[Chorus]
Let's throw a bottle party
Feel like Pablo in these projects
Party, party, party, like Chapo got out, bitch
Loco, loco, loco, we got coco
Only real niggas in my photo
Only real killas in my photo
Only real trappas in my photo
Loco, loco, loco, we got coco
Only real plugs in my photo

[Outro]
I'm bout to run me up a check again
Thank the Lord, I just met another Mexican
