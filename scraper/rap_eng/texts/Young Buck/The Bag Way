[Intro: Young Buck]
Yeah
The bag way
Fuck these old niggas, get yo' money young nigga
Let's get it

[Hook: Young Buck & MoneyBagg Yo]
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Thumbin' through these hundreds, I get it the bag way
Flexin' in these foreigns, I did it the bag way (now go get a check)
She ain't fuckin' with you unless it's the bag way
I can blow a bag on a bag day (now go get a check)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I ran it up in the trap, and I do it that strap way
Met me a Migo and I started gettin' it, yeah dat way
My ex-bitch pulled up, flexed on me, can't forget that day
Nigga just hit a bad lick with his last blunt in his ashtray
I re-ed up with the rest on me, got me a big bag of yay
I ain't got nothin' to give to ya, nigga everybody gon' have to pay
I blow the rest that was left on me, bought me a big place to stay
Took the Cartiers off my face to see a lotta niggas just in the way
(Fuck whoever done slept on me!)
(Now go get a check)
VVS my bitch up, and my shit on it
They done made me pick that stick up, knowin' I'm gon' spit
Y'all got all that y'all gon' get, you niggas just don't want shit
I'm like

[Hook: Young Buck & MoneyBagg Yo]
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Thumbin' through these hundreds, I get it the bag way
Flexin' in these foreigns, I did it the bag way (now go get a check)
She ain't fuckin' with you unless it's the bag way
I can blow a bag on a bag day (now go get a check)

[Verse 2: MoneyBagg Yo]
I just blew a bag on a Tuesday
All my diamonds wet just like a coochie
I like all my bitches bad and boujee
I'm a savage nigga like Webbie and Boosie
If you ain't talkin' money you gon' lose me
Flex, I sell packs, I blow racks, I shoot movies
I'm no ordinary nigga, I got swag, hoe
I'm in Cashville, that's where I met my last hoe, my past hoe
Yeah, my neck and my wrist is a bag
I pull up the lot, paper tag
If you broke then go get you some cash
I'm puffin' and chokin' on gas
93 days diesel
Rockstar like the Beatles
All I dreamed about was a bag
Get the money first, never last

[Hook: Young Buck & MoneyBagg Yo]
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check (the bag way)
Now go get a check (run it up, run it up)
Now go get a check

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Thumbin' through these hundreds, I get it the bag way
Flexin' in these foreigns, I did it the bag way (now go get a check)
She ain't fuckin' with you unless it's the bag way
I can blow a bag on a bag day (now go get a check)
