[Intro]
Fatality I’m trying to get some money leave me alone hoe

[Chorus]
I’m not coming home (I’m not coming home)
They begging and I’m gone (my bad)
I’m running up them racks rubber band stacks and I’m blowing them strong
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I got back home
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I’m right back home (repeat)

[Verse 1]
Dope dealer I can lose the money
Get it right back and then bet it all
F*ck it up while you cut it up
Naw f*ck that I’d rather sell it raw
Bought my hoes n rhymes over n*gga
Bought every bag over her shoulder n*gga
And you be thinking I’m tricking but she did everything that I told her n*gga
God damn it got the trap and it about to go and get I’m a loose cannon
All the sh*t I’ve been through n*gga’s looking at me like how is you standing
I’ve been sleeping in the plug house
Waking up and eating breakfast with them
Taking weight to these fifty states
All through the bottom of Texas with them
The game cold I done lost loads
I’ll see you n*gga’s at the crossroads
Right now I’m in boss mode but my young n*gga’s still toss hoes
Crazy thing that I’m still cooking in the same trap since the snot nose
Ask me how I’m doing this sh*t truthfully I do not know but

[Chorus]
I’m not coming home (I’m not coming home)
They begging and I’m gone (my bad)
I’m running up them racks rubber band stacks and I’m blowing them strong
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I got back home
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I’m right back home (repeat)

[Verse 2]
I got a trap queen that never left me
She went with her right hand she a lefty
She said we gone sell this dope until we get back on (let’s get this money hoe)
Get rich n*gga get wealthy but that hating sh*t it ain't healthy
Cause I’m the king of this sh*t I’m the back bone (don’t you forget)
Little n*gga with no ice I’m gone shine bright
I need no pics I need no life
With no deal I had 18 wheels and I don’t give a f*ck about yo price
N*gga you the reason that I ain’t leaving got the pop love and I’m eating decent
I ain’t tripping go and blow your bag drop your top go and n*gga go and lease it
Y’all n*gga’s too rich for me I’m a break it down you know bone and pieces
I been whipping with my left hand
Man it’s time for me to gone and freeze it
I need me some more rubber bands
I been counting while you n*gga’s been sleeping
Buy this hoe anything she want this the reason me and my b*tch beefing

[Chorus]
I’m not coming home (I’m not coming home)
They begging and I’m gone (my bad)
I’m running up them racks rubber band stacks and I’m blowing them strong
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I got back home
Got sack and I’m in my zone
Got a pack and I’m right back home (repeat)

[Outro]
Woo what the f*ck
