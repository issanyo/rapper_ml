[Chorus]
Yeah, it's up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there

[Verse 1]
Pulled up at the Texaco and you was up there
Caught you flexin' with yo' hoe, I'm like what's up now
Codeine cowboy poured up four and said my cup there
Hell fuck yeah!
Let's get Buck now
Perc after perc, work, work, work, run up a check
Bottle after bottle
Fuck up your wrist then flood up your neck
Red rag and blue flags nigga
Twist yo' finga then throw up yo' set
Why the fuck is you mad nigga
Get out yo' feelings, bitch run up a check
Shoot first, I shoot first
Street nigga, I move work
Two bricks, two shirts
That bullshit get you murked
That real shit get you rich
That lil shit get you hit
I got a bag on me, shit lit
I ain't playin' around lil bitch

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there

[Verse 2]
Brick after brick, clip, clip, clip, stick after stick
Bang, bang, bang, gang, gang, gang, blood, blood, blood, crip after crip
Whip after whip, chain, chain, chain, rollie, rollie, rollie, flick up the wrist
Foreign, foreign in the front yard
I'mma pull up, pull up, and pick up your bitch
Bag on me, yeah it's up there
Bad bitches, say what's up now
Broke niggas can't come around
Keep a shooter with me in the cut now
Black Phantom, got a 40 in it
I be bringin' niggas orders in it
Funeral homes love me
Nigga, I'm the one who keep the morgue in business
Smack who, nigga not me
Shot who, you ain't shot me
I don't claim to be the realest nigga
I just say I'm in the top 3
I can't even try to love a hoe
I just went and got another hoe
Money over bitches, nigga
She told me that, my momma know

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there
Bands all in my pocket got me up there
Extendo on my waist, bitch I be up there
I'm sorry, it's too late 'cause now it's up there
Hell fuck yeah!
I took it up there
