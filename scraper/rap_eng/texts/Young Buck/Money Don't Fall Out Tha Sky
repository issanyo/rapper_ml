[Young Buck talking]
Young Buck, Quanie Cash and Gutter Boy nigga
We come to tell all you broke niggas to get yo stash on get cash on nigga!
Ain't no telling when this motherfucka 'bout to blow
And these motherfuckers running around here with nothing in their pocket
Not me nigga... this shit don't grow on trees nigga!

[Verse One - Young Buck]
Now if I sitted on my ass I wouldn't be sitting on this cash
Come outside the club legs is cocked up on the grass
Smoking pounds of this skunk while you rolling dime bags
I just laugh cuz some of these niggas out here love doing bad
Ask any motherfucker bout T.I.P
Totally Independent Pimping in uh GS3
Keep on jacking off that money you'll never see uh key
I know niggas 53 still out here selling d
Priest told me from the jump never go and get that cheese
D-Tay went and got the pump now where creeping while you sleep
Gangbang slang cane whatever just maintain
Listen man there's a million niggas doing the same thang
Plain Jane sipping syrup while the BG playing
I'm all in your lane in this 99 Sudan
So when a nigga put them daytons on that's when the hatings on
"Bitch get some money!" what 'cha you niggas waiting on?

[Hook - Young Buck (Gutter Boy)]
This shit they call money don't fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getter-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail
Cuz real thugs shed blood and they hard to kill
Listen this shit they call money ain't going to fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getter-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail
Cuz real thugs shed blood and they hard to kill

[Quanie Cash]
If I sit around waiting of these world of payment
I'ma get it how I live it or die trying to make it
A chance I'll take it if its worth it cuz I'm all about money
My name speaks for itself I'ma let them others keep fronting
I keep my keys coming cuz I'ma motherfucking thug
And I keep my heat busting ain't no love from my slugs
Use to sever underground now as real as on top
But if a nigga broke I ain't scared to get back on there on the block
Running from cops and jumping out of automobiles
Cuz I'm dirty I ain't trying to go back to jail and that's real
Niggas get they hands out like money be falling out the sky
If it is I wonder where it be at when I'm outside
I put in work for this shit; I did dirt for this shit
I hurt for this shit, what 'cha mean I don't deserve this?
I'm fulgent my shit nigga cuz mines is splurge
I'm a bottom boy Go-Getta-Nigga fuck what 'cha heard

[Hook - Young Buck (Gutter Boy)]

Look this shit they call money ain't going to fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getta-Nigga (ride or die!)

[Gutter Boy]
I can Shogun in a bottom or I can Shogun in Harlem
I Shoguns at a problems squeeze triggers and solve them
The hoe they love us to death and the copper can't stand us
Cuz I sell more chickens then motherfucking Colonel Sanders
F.B.I trying to kill us with the ray guns and cameras
The only block all they saw was thugs with braids and bandanas
If selling dope was boxing I'll be the greatest of all time
See the niggas in my click and bitch we all shine
We all tote 9's I was born to be the king
This nigga was moving birds so I had to clip his wings
Now I'm driving top drops sporting flints and rings and things
At the club they say my name hoes where sure the skirts came
Ain't no shame in my game I was born to ball
Yo trying to play me Glock pop guns born to ball
Born to brawl when ya niggas was born to stall
What you make in a week is what I spend at the mall

[Hook - Young Buck (Gutter Boy)]
Nigga this shit they call money ain't going to fall out the sky
You got to be a Go-Getta-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail

You got to be a Go-Getta-Nigga (ride or die!)
Ready to take chances fuck death for jail
Cuz real thugs shed blood and they hard to kill
