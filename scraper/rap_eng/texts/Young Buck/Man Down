(feat. Prodigy)

[Intro:]
G.unit
Eyo spider
Eyo hit that nigga banks up
Tell em man
Ey man I just seen the niggas man
(yeah)
Yeah man tell a nigga call pete
Call a nigga half tell em niggas common man
(wassap)
Them niggas over there
Man a nigga slippy man
They all been fucking with some hoes and shit
Common niggas let's go

[Chorus: Young Buck]
(let's gooo)
If you just a nigga spinnin outside
We gone hustle bout da wide
Overside
Nigga hit there ass up
Every body die when the bullets start to fly
Let em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up
Man down (aeeeh)
Some body got hit
Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip
Man down (awhh)
You hear em people screamin
They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin'

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Since homie know ma face
Ain't no need for no ski mask
Hollow tips can make a nigga go to sleep fast
Catch em stuck and show em nauf in his E class
Pull up and put a hole in his cheap ass
Bought a Glock and a kayne with a body on it
And show the blood over spit nobody else want it
Whole kinda bitch throwem in da back seat
Empty out the clip make them hoes wanna track me
Don't u love it when your enemy has lost
And the sound of the 12 gage when it sound doze
U cathc that ass slippin and he blame it on hiss boss
Begin or his life askin you how much it cost
A bullet has no eyes and the trigger has no heart
The people never stop so the war bout to start
Don't be out there
Am tellin nigga as soon as filthy dark
We gone circle bout da block
And throw it less you want

[Chorus: Young Buck]
(let's gooo)
If you just a nigga spinnin outside
We gone hustle bout da wide
Overside
Nigga hit there ass up
Every body die when the bullets start to fly
Let em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up
Man down (aeeeh)
Some body got hit
Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip
Man down (awhh)
You hear em people screamin
They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin'

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Ningga ma slow flows ain't touch a bow
Your fans cahnge their mind
When P comes through
Cause I be sittin in da drop
Skimmin with the top
Then your hoes saw the video now they wanna pop
And maybe cause I gave David that stack
He cover ma risk with invisible sacks
Fresh off the private jacks
Now we in da projects takin pictures with the kids
Call me ORP or VIP da dawn
The people love me cause I say what they want
Tell these rappers they ain't shit they mommas too
When u see me in da streets whachu gonna do
Pull your heads down to your feet and grow somewhere else
Better escape far make sort out your grill
Nigga am laughin at the top of the world
It's the unit
Pray that you could do it
How we do it

[Chorus: Young Buck]
(let's gooo)
If you just a nigga spinnin outside
We gone hustle bout da wide
Overside
Nigga hit there ass up
Every body die when the bullets start to fly
Let em dry till da ambulance pick there ass up
Man down (aeeeh)
Some body got hit
Them niggas can't do it empty out the whole clip
Man down (awhh)
You hear em people screamin
They pumpin on the chest but your man ain't breathin'
