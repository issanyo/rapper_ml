[Young Buck:]
What up?
Ya'll know who it is
G Unit South in this motherfucker
And you know I don't really dance much
But i'm a sit here and smoke my motherfuckin' weed

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I'm in the club rollin' up everybody smokin'
Gone on Patrone and this Ex got me rollin'
I'm just twistin' my blunt I'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
The block been good I got a bank roll
You want to know if its dro what you think ho?
I'm just twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
In my city i'm the fuckin' weed man
Holla at me I got what you need man
These niggas must think i'm a fool
354 oh, I make the rules
Hold on let me show you what i'm workin' with
The Bubba Kush and that Granddaddy Purple shit
Damn right I got a big old car
On that dro thats in a big old jar
Break a blunt down i'm a fill it up
We 'gon go through the whole pound I don't give a fuck
We 'gon smoke on that Bobby Brown you know what it is
You might got the good but you ain't got this
Yeah, put it in the air
Lets do it like Bob Marley was up in here
I don't share
But you can roll up your own
And we ain't leavin' this bitch until all the weed gone

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I'm in the club rollin' up everybody smokin'
Gone on Patrone and this Ex got me rollin'
I'm just twistin' my blunt I'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
The block been good I got a bank roll
You want to know if its dro what you think ho?
I'm just twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
We all get high this is how we do it
Pull up the lean and DJ Screw it
Hot as hell and the hoes gettin' sweaty
I'm twistin' my blunt even if they don't let me
You niggas ain't ready
I'm a do what I do
I blow Kush in a hater's face fuck you too
You can't smoke for free
This how its supposed to be
Shorty say she ain't with it then its more for me
Who got a light now?
I mean right now
I'm about to see if its the shit that make 'em fight now
My clique iced out
Hollerin' G Unit South
We all got four cars and a weed house
Show you what we about
I get my grind on
I won't leave the block 'till every dime gone
And when the police come we gettin' low
Middle fingers in the air niggas smokin' that dro

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I'm in the club rollin' up everybody smokin'
Gone on Patrone and this Ex got me rollin'
I'm just twistin' my blunt I'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
The block been good I got a bank roll
You want to know if its dro what you think ho?
I'm just twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high
Twistin' my blunt i'm gettin' high

[Young Buck:]
This is the part when the gangstas walk
This is the part when you put your blunt down
This is the part when you throw ya hood up
This is the part where we all get high
