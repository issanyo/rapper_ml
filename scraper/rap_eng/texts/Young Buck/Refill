[Intro]
Fatality
I’m f*cking rhyme with the work( whip it)
I’m f*cking rhyme with the work  (flip it)
I’m f*cking rhyme with the work (let’s do it)
(repeat)
I’m a be selling my dope around here until n*gga’s put me in the dirt (repeat)

[Chorus]
Naw we don’t run out naw we don’t run out
Uh huh we don’t run out I ain’t never ran out
I just real real real breezy real real breezy real real breezy (repeat)

[Verse 1]
We ain’t running low
I’m trained to go
I’m a kick yo door
Make you hit the floor
Hungry n*gga I come to get the kilo
My n*gga nose running
Got no money would’ve been good but he stole from me
Every brick I used to give to the n*gga he’d blow
I got Mars n*gga I’m a lawyer n*gga
Been doing this way before you n*gga
You a spoiled n*gga I’m a street n*gga  you know
Got old ones got new b*tches my day ones no new n*gga’s
My report card all A’s n*gga you a hoe (gat gat gat)
I’m vested up VBS up smoke Bob Marley stay blessed up
I’m a pop a ceiling don’t worry about what I pour
She really real n*gga’s refill you won’t gas up I bet we will
I spend everything I got right now to get more

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I done been down but I ain’t never out
I sit down and count you know what I’m about
Go and get to work in the drought (I roll)
Make safety first check paperwork
Sh*t all good but I could make it worse
N*gga better not open up his mouth
About what I sold (gat gat gat)
Got bank robbers got boosted b*tches got teenagers going to shoot you n*gga’s
And honestly there’s more to me than what I show
I’ve been counted out while I was counting up
And then they counting on me to holler buck
N*gga throw me something
I’m looking at them like no
Now won’t you stay calm
Got track marks all in every arm
Won’t be satisfied until his heads just overdose
I’ve been waiting patiently at the gas station two 18 wheelers drag racing
All I want to know is when you close

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ya dig it’s going down like that that there we gonna hit you upside the mutha f*ckin head with nothing but  gangsta music man
A who I want you to hit em upside the hit and lets take off y’all
