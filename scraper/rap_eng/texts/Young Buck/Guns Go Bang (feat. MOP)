(feat. M.O.P.)

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun
If you don't want none
Then that ass better run
You can get hit
In the middle of this shit
Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin'

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Two four fives tattood on my side
You will die nigga before I lose my pride
I don't hide nigga
This ain't a bullet-proof ride
I be out there, for any nigga want to try
Ain't a vest that they make that can take a chopper
An unsolved mystery if its done proper
Partner
Look what happened to Jimmy Hoffa
They still ain't found his ass so who shot him?
AKs I got 'em
I mean alot of 'em
Got it lookin' like Fort Knox in this bitch
A .40 cal Glock, shoot thirty two shots
Can't tell me I ain't ready to get in some shit
Make a lane for me, homie get out the way
Been out of contro and I ain't got no brakes
Like a G would
I just do it for the hood
If I rob you then my whole block good

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun
If you don't want none
Then that ass better run
You can get hit
In the middle of this shit
Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin'

[Verse 2: Lil' Fame]
Yo I been thuggin' with these Brownville niggas for a long, long time (YUH!)
We put it down for a long, long time (YUH!)
Scuffle in these streets for a long long time
And ain't too many fuckin' with mine
Now I've been..spittin' at you bitches for a long long time
Gettin' at you bitches for a long long time
Brownsville style [NIGGA!!]
Head to toe
Anti X and O
Thats how I do it ya'll, thats how I does it
Don't give a fuck (Brrraatt) if you Blood or Cuzzin
Keep your ears tuned to this nigga, I be dancin' with the Grim Reaper
Stuck in this bitch gettin' deeper
So, gangsta boogie with the gangsta
Gangsta boogie with the gangsta
Gangsta boogie
Every street nigga ain't a rapper
And every rapper ain't a street nigga
So holla at me

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun
If you don't want none
Then that ass better run
You can get hit
In the middle of this shit
Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin'

[Verse 3: Billy Danze]
Don't bitch out now nigga, you see me comin' with the Magnum
Heavy copper tops (SPIT!)
Clear out ya block (QUICK!)
M.O.P. faggot we at it again with (G-UNIT!!)
Look roll up in your truck and I'll pump something through it
[Ca$hville] Buck said they love me
'Cause I'm side steppin' and grippin' my weapon when it's ugly
And y'all can't touch me
Easy how you rub me
I'll show you the meanin' of what a true thug be (Yeaahh!)
Brooklyn, home to the black bags and the white sheets
It's where we re-position niggas off they feet
It's rugged in the street (FO'SHO!)
We learn to, kick off a clip and open ya shit at the door
So, no sudden moves don't do it
You'll get found chopped in a bag and stuffed in a Buick
The moral of the story is we get to it
Where the G's roll
And dude I never walk alone (HAA!)

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Shots rang out, if you ain't got a gun
If you don't want none
Then that ass better run
You can get hit
In the middle of this shit
Bullets don't have no eyes when them motherfuckers come
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Let your gun go bang (BANG!)
Squeeze the trigga nigga, do the damn thang
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Let your guns go bang (BANG!)
Anybody can get it, that's all I'm sayin'
