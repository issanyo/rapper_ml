Yeah it's me, Young Buck
Get your cameras ready

[Chorus:]
I've been good int he Hood
Different shoot outs, the same shit
Bin a while since ya heard a buck album
It's just business, kept my distance
Now where the mutha fu-kers at, I gotta have em
Buck another album, pop another Valium
Roll another blunt get buck, I'm back
They pulling me back [x5]

Uhh yeah
Right now I need the media to just pay close attention
As I do me niggas

Up until today, I still haven't heard a word from Dre
Or word from Em, I still fuck with them
Me and Fifty ain't spoke and Banks ain't called
I ain't seen or ran into Yayo at all
But I'm out here, for whatever it's worth
My enemies asking me to sell em a verse
Huh, bury me alive, cover me up with dirt
You'll probably die trying to take your ass to church
Bandanna check, 40 Glock check
I got stacks and AK's on deck
The spotlights all yours (do you) they all looking at you (go head)
And I ain't started on the first chapter

[Chorus]

Pac rolling over in his grave
Looking at the way these rap niggas behave
All these wannabe Kanye's
Bitches imitating Beyonce
Niâ€“as trying to fuck Chris Brown ex fiance
Where the hell is Andre
At times like these we need all the MC's on the on Antre
Rappers buy chains everyday, get vibe at the all star game in LA
Separate me from them, I am not him
Cut from a different clothe than your favorite rapper
This is called pain, watch what you take
Remember I ain't even started on the first chapter

[Chorus]

[talking: Young Buck]
Yeah you know who it is right
Swagga like no other nigga, it's just me my nigga
I'm just saying nigga, holla at me nigga
IamYoungBuck.com
I told you niggas I was back on my Buckshit
Classic shit, big boy shit on the way
Matter of fact, only God can judge me
Shutout to Bigger Wanky
Hosted by Freeway Ricky Ross, uh, pay attention people
Sink is real real on a minute, you understand me?
And i'm really out here my nigga
Shutout to Unit Motor Sports, good looking on the Phantom homie!
Hah, for real!
I was paying a goddamn..
I was paying more for my motherfucking Bentley
I mean shutout to Unit Motor Sport for real
