[Intro]
Yeah let's take this shit back, uh
(Whoo Kid!) Y'all remember that right?
This Buck, Cashville, y'all know

[Verse 1]
Uh, way back in the day
Deep, deep down south where the nigga had a lil pack of yay
Cause the nigga with the big AK
Tryna rob everybody round here where I stay
Back then I was at your house party
Had your little sister on the walk in loose
Pour a little Hen in the punch in the juice
Used to take a one on one back then for a boost
Couldn't step in the booth
Talk that shit, nigga had to know you was the truth
Couldn't lie what your life bout
Had to tell these folk what you really goin' through
The rap game on some other shit
They ain't tellin' what they doin', tellin' what they gon' do
Get caught up with a couple bricks
And guess what nigga, they tellin' on you
See I'm still on this Scarface shit
Gotta kill these niggas, you tellin' on who?
I can't just turn my back on the trap
I'm out here sellin' it too
I'm connected all in Cali
Pounds of the kush, we lettin' it through
And a nigga tryna spread the love
So what y'all niggas really ready to do?

[Hook]
I'm just tryna bring it back to the Master P days
Make the pot say, ughhh
Make the pot say, ughhh
I can bring it back like, ughhh
I'm just tryna bring it back to the Master P days
Make the pot say, ughhh
Make the pot say, ughhh
I can bring it back like, ughhh

[Interlude]
You bout it? Yeah
I'm bout it, bout it, you know
Ay where you from homie?
You know that dirty south gangsta shit, ay put your hood up

[Verse 2]
I represent, it's G-Unit gang
Country nigga all in Queens sellin' cocaine
I fuck that white girl, I push that dog food
I know ways to make sure we get it all through
I fuck with gang members that's gon' die about it
I fuck with lean sippers that's gon' die without it
You got it? Cause I got it, got it
I roll with the windows up, cloudy, cloudy
Shit chill, I got bricks here
Sellin' dope out the house and I live there
So many came to the South think I kill here
I'm just tryna figure out why I'm still here

[Interlude 2]
Ay let me hit that
I'm bout to elevate, elevation
Tryna elevate on you niggas

[Verse 3]
Switchin' positions in this (?)
I'm all in Tucson
Tryna meet this Cuban
He not the plug but he said he knew some
You're gonna have to keep your mouth closed if I let you come
If I get you this I'm gon' have to kill ya if you run
Posted in the front of the church pew with two guns
Prayin' that the Lord let me make it through with these 2 tons
Knowin' niggas with me just to see if I give you one
Funny how when you get rich niggas think that you dumb
Where you from?
Where I'm from murder's always the outcome
Your strap is like your everything you can't leave home without one
Man they got me puttin' my gun in the hand of my son
Somebody come in this house then y'all gon' see what I done
Why I'm keepin' so much reefer now in my lungs
I tell 'em I've been pissin' on probation for the last three years
You ask me if we hot right now, yes we is
Is 2Pac missed nigga? Yes he is

[Interlude 3]
Hey man I never seen
Seen so many people this point man in my life homie
I'm one of those people
It's all the real niggas that's not here no more
Rest in peace

[Verse 4]
First you here, before you know it, it's too late y'all
Close your eyes then you think about Nate Dogg
Lil Flat, Lord Infamous, they died real
DJ Screw, Fat Pat, Pimp C died trill
Soulja Slim, Doe B
Now all the ladies drop Left Eye left tear
Big Pun, Biggie Smalls, A$AP Yams too
Eazy-E, ODB, man this can't be true
Gang Starr, Mac Dre, Jam Master J
Heavy D, Slim Dunk, and he was from the A
Static Major, Lil Wayne had him on his way
Lil Snupe, I seen him with Meek just the other day
It's okay y'all the truth here
I know Eminem feelin' like me, we wish Proof was here
Obituary like a souvenir
We just look at 'em and reminisce about when you was here

[Interlude 4]
Somebody pour up, yeah
I ain't fuck with that old fake ass purp they got out here right now
Give me the red Hi-Tec, shit ain't no Actavis
Yessir, Three 6 Mafia featuring UGK up in this joint
We about to sip on this sizzurp
(There's about to be a whole lotta sippin' it up
Pourin' it up, drankin' it up
Goin' on round here in the EST boy)
Y'all know how we do it
(Now pour it on up)
Oh and I fuck with the yellow too

[Bridge]
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp
Sippin' on some sizzurp
Sip, sip, sippin' on some sizzurp

[Verse 5]
I'm still poppin' these pills, I ain't new to this
I put yellow tuss and ex on big old blunts of cannabis
I sip Hi-Tec by the pint tryna see just how high I can get
It's an embarrassment just to hear a nigga say "I quit"
Yeah that Actavis I like but I can't pay for that fake shit
Don't know what's that in your Sprite, woah purp niggas make me sick
She said "Buck you takin' flight" least that molly got me right
Plus these niggas doin' all this snitchin' baby I've been outta (whoo)
I've just been sippin' on some sizzurp

[Outro]
Yeah you know they was countin' me out
I was so well countin' up and
Now the whole world countin' on me
It's Buck, yeah (Whoo Kid)
Haha, yeah
