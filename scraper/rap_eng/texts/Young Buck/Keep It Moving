[Verse 1]

Broken promises let me acknowledge this
Trap stories bout some pussy niggas who used to move the packs for me
Street dreams tryna get that porsche carrera
I bought birds through that whole bling bling era
You spent yours on just buyin whateva
If you like it i love it, if you did it i done it
But i didn't see it comin cuz the water kept runnin yeah the water kept runnin
Now im floodin the town
Bitches always wanted me but they lovin me now
I shoot off in the face and hustle up in the house
But the block got hot
I ain't quit i just chilled
Niggas thought it was over and they all disappeared

[Chorus]

They all balled with me, kept em fresh to death
The feds came in town, they left me by myself
(but i just kept it movin)
Now i am still shinin, they ain't got nothin left
The same ones that hate on me look like they need some help
(But i just keep it movin)

[Verse 2]

Death before dishonor
Bury me with bricks and a llama
And havin gettin head from a bitch lil like Madonna
Bout money put up, lawyer on speed
All my old bitches on need now
Family members greedy, everybody cut throat
They won't be satisfied untill they see Buck broke
So I'm holla no bet, till you pay your old debt
Call it sittin on it, dope buyin soul yet
I ain't ready to go yet, I know it's more money here
They gon' have to kill me or give me a 100 years
Showed niggas love and niggas showed me hate
Gave niggas the plug, they couldn't handle the way, mama stay

[Chorus]

They all balled with me, kept em fresh to death
The feds came in town, they left me by myself
(but i just kept it movin)
Now i am still shinin, they ain't got nothin left
The same ones that hate on me look like they need some help
(But i just keep it movin)
