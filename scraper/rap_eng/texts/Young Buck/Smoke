Told your man if I burn one and if you do the number take the sun down
Wait to blop, say where you come from
Smoke my problems away

My partner die right beside making my mind right
Roll up the kush kush they know they can’t hide that light
Come one it ain’t the time right
Fuck that we riddin in night
Fuck climbing, roll the wind and down to hit the lights
Whassup,then they they chop it on with the smoke in my wind pipe
Feel the punds to the beat when they see cake
I’m like bitch getting in, bitch make sure no body’s hits
Roll my problems in a blunt and dumping ashes
She turning her nose up everytime she pass here
Blood shut, my eyes red I got em glasses
Say she wanna hit it but she might be late for a class
Shit do we get all in that bad man?
And the girlfriends gonna tell it if she ask ‚em
I know, it’s money over bitches, you know don’t rest this for sure
I just poof poof poff then I pass him

Smoke my problems away , excuse me mr.officer
I dont mean to bother ya , and i dont want a problems sir
But right now I wanna smoke my problems away
Do you mind if I burn one
And if you do the number take the sun down
Went the blup right to do it from where you come from
Let me smoke my problems away

I use to party with my shooters and put my joint out
Don’t wanna hear it if you nigga shit keep going out
They lase some blunts, that’s the shit if you ain’t know
No disrespect I like Mary Jane play
Evre keep make my mind on, I buy your berry hit
You ever be in one line up when the people say your name ?
Say we pull up beside ‚’em and all they heard was boom
So right now I’m taking my problems and roll on the paper
Some of the bubble cush cuz nothign see wow will pay us
Smoking with snoof line he told me due time
Don’t worry you’re fine, you know I brough to catch
You taking laiding and try desire, I do
No ask trace homie just use whatever to want
They smoke for free whatever they do I hope you gran
That ass on me but next time you blind

Smoke my problems away
I don’t lose a parter yet and I don’t want no problems
But right now I wanna pose my problems away
Do your main if I burn one
And if you do the number take the sun down
Went the blup right to do it from where you come from
Let me smoke my problems away
Put the problems in paper
Smoke my problems away
