[Intro: Young Buck & 50 Cent]
G-Unit! Yeah! You better kill me!
50, lemme get these niggas!
Get ’em Buck!

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I brush my teeth, load my clip, and go bust my heat
I’m in too deep, I can’t say fuck the streets
I need some sleep, the fiends still comin’
Bush ’bout to blow this bitch up. Better get money
Dead bodys get picked up. On daily routines now
Niggas we’re digital, but they work triple beams now
I’m livin’ for me now, cuz I done went to war with the other side
Lucky me, cuz the enemies mother and brother died
Hot shot gun shell’s and teflon chest plate’s
It’s tatt’ed on my arm nigga, thugin’ till my death day
Y’all niggas just wait, right after my court date
It’s gonna get grimey, like New York say
Bitch niggas horse play, real niggas gon’ spray
Bang the fo’, change clothes, and come back the same day
Better holla mayday, cuz we comin’
And we gunnin’ at any muthafucka want sumthin’

[Chorus: Young Buck]
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga, and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
Cuz niggas’ll put a hole in ya ass, and that’s real
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga, and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
Cuz niggas’ll put a hole in ya ass, and that’s real

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I’m already dead, can’t kill me nigga
And even if I do die, I’m still gon’ kill ya
I’m unfamiliar with alot of these soldiers
I go out in the road, and niggas think that it’s over
Runnin’, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the D’
You would think niggas know, cuz they older than me
Been here longer than me, and still piecein’ a ounce out
How can ya’ be a birdman, if you don’t know how to count
It’s back to the black gloves, and home invasions
Puttin’ holes in a nigga, the size of a gold Dayton
No I’m not waitin on nothin, no more
Eather you pay me what you wwe me, or I’m cuttin’ ya throat
Nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the ho
How I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope
I’ll be glad to go to the pen over revenge
I’m comin’ out the same way, a nigga went in

[Chorus: Young Buck]
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga, and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
Cuz niggas’ll put a hole in ya ass, and that’s real
They say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
But rub me the wrong way, nigga, and I will
Thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
Cuz niggas’ll put a hole in ya ass, and that’s real

[Outro: Young Buck]
Boom! G-Unit! We on some military shit nigga
You better kill us all, cuz we commin’
Muthafucka’s!
