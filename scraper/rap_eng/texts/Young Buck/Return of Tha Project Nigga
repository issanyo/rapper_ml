[Intro]
Aye yo, Whuddup? (If I should die)
It's Cashville's own nigga! (Befo' I wake)
Young Buck! G-Unit! (Praise the Lord)
Lot of shit goin' down here (My soul to take)
But I ain't goin' nowhere
Holla when ya see me!

[Verse]
Tha return of tha project nigga (K'Yeah!)
A 100 bricks strong and my pockets bigga (Oh!)
Still holdin' tha throne, it's too late to hate me
Hella, I'm Cashville's own in a black Mercedes
TVs in dis bitch, I don't know how to turn 'em on
I've just bought dis mothafucka and shipped it home
In traffic we smokin', sun-roof closed
Hoes pullin' up like “Oh, there he goes!”
Ain't nobody on dat beef shit (Nah!)
It's too many Mexicans wit' the cheap bricks (Yeah!)
Peep dis, all ya need is a big heart
A quarta' bird, that's like givin' you a kickstart (Let's Go!)
You didn't heard 'bout tha flex, that's the undacovas
Ridin' round, jumpin' out, searchin' mothafuckas (Hey!)
So we open at 9 and we close at 5 (Huh!)
Keep a nigga in a ride, 'case I close my eyes
I won't stop 'till they kill me (Nah!)
Betta yet, 'till tha whole world feel me (Yeah!)
Lemme tell ya 'bout dis town where I come from
Cashville, Tenn-A-Key look what I've done (Look nigga!)
See me on tha map and tha public love it
Police in tha streets like "Nawh, fuck it"
It's me against tha government, they don't know how to take me
They done see that tape and they thank I'm crazy (Yeah!)
Shuttin' down my birthday bash
Well Officer Calvin Hulay, you can kiss my ass!
I was crap in the trap too
You on dat racist shit and I'ma black dude (Bitch!)
Even took my license and say they suspend it
But come to find out dat  bitch pretended (Unh!)
I dropped a thug rap platinum album in tha 'Ville
So somebody please tell dat coward who I is, Bitch!

[Outro]
It's like
I'm tha 1st one, but I ain't tha only one
To holla Cashville mothafuckas
So
I'm trynna outlive my city out here nigga
And tha fuckin' police hatin' on a nigga
Fuck y'all!
