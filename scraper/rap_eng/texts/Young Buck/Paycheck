[Chorus]
You know you need me, I'm your paycheck (I'm a check)
Work for every dollar that I get
Where my check at?
You can't leave me, I'm your paycheck (I'm the check)
Really ain't no reason why I ain't got rich yet

I've been waking up and working for this money (For this check)
I've been hustlin, I deserve to get this money (Get this check)
I'm a paycheck
You're looking at your paycheck

[Verse 1]
I'm clocking in again (Yup!)
Where my check?
Still searching for a way out hoping one day this gonna pay out Waiting to wake up and don't have to pull this AK out (What?)
Gangstas never leave we get rich and move way out (Move way out)
I told these niggas one day that bullshit was gonna play out
My dawg got out the cage
He was hungry watched him stray out
Instead of finding food
He got killed his first day out
Shorty think I'm rude (Why is that?)
I just told the bitch straight out
I catch you with another dude
You might as well stay out (bitch)
I used to rent the cars as a kid with my yay out
Fuckin with my check is some shit I do not play bout (nah)

[Chorus]
You know you need me, I'm your paycheck (I'm a check)
Work for every dollar that I get
Where my check at?
You can't leave me, I'm your paycheck (I'm the check)
Really ain't no reason why I ain't got rich yet

I've been waking up and working for this money (For this check)
I've been hustlin, I deserve to get this money (Get this check)
I'm a paycheck
You're looking at your paycheck

[Verse 2]
Tell me I ain't worth it
I'mma ask you what you worth
As long as we got it, it don't matter who get it first
I'mma tell you niggas straight up
My lil homie comin home to get his cake up
He got one day and a wake up
10 years straight and he never pick the weight up (never)
Say he can't wait to come home and pick some weight up (trap)
Hit em with a no-look pass, them niggas miss they lay up (Damn)
I'm gonna call a timeout if you niggas do not pay up
Referee the game when both my arms stay up
(Whats that?)
We call it a touchdown
Better not fuck the play up
(Buckshot)

[Chorus]
You know you need me, I'm your paycheck (I'm a check)
Work for every dollar that I get
Where my check at?
You can't leave me, I'm your paycheck (I'm the check)
Really ain't no reason why I ain't got rich yet

I've been waking up and working for this money (For this check)
I've been hustlin, I deserve to get this money (Get this check)
I'm a paycheck
You're looking at your paycheck
