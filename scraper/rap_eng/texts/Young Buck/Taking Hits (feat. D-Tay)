(Verse three-Young Buck)
Hey There He Go, He Don't Know That We Behind Him
So Go Pull Up Beside Him, And Lemme Put This 9 In Him
You Ever Seen The 30-30 With The Scope On It?
A Bunch Of Niggas Smokin Weed, That Got Dope On It
And We Don't Leave No Evidence, Or No Finger Prints
Follow Certain Elements, Cuz Niggas Goto Jail For This
They Say I'm Heaven Sent, I Think I'm Hell Bound
Cuz I'm Addicted To The Way A 12 Gauge Sound

(Verse four-D-Tay)
I Keep The Dough In, Swing The Chopper And The Pit-Bull Shit
If He Run, He Ain't Gettin One, Get A Clip Full Of It
Thats For Movin, Must Have Been Some Confusion, When I Came In
Told You Lay The Fuck Down, Or Else These Bullets Cave In
Must Thought I Was Playin, Im'a Let You Know When I Shoot That 4
How It Go When A Gangster Roll, Murder Man, Blood Bath, What'd You Take It For
I Ain't Playin' Games, Ain't Nuthing Gon' Ever Change
Murder Put Money On Your Head, Gimme His Brain, Muthafucka!
