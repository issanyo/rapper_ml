[Intro]
Ay yo, what it do, It’s ya muthafuckin’ homeboy Young Buck
And this another world premier, strictly for the traps and trunks
Let’s Go

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Rollin’, and I got 36 ounces with me
Some bad bitches in the trap and they countin’ with me
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown
Rollin’, and I got pounds in the back of this shit
A bunch of pills and I’m ready, ay bitch you know I’m heavy and you know
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Dope deals and dice games
Kilos and light change
Bitch, I like nice thangs so I was there when that white came
Pyrex in ziplocks
Cook one, then switch pots
Posted up on my bitch block in polo’s and flip flops
A big ol’ chain and a big watch
Some bond money at my baby mama house, in case I get popped
On the way to shaitown, let’s make a quick stop
My walking Keegan niggas getting money, that’s a quick drop
A hundred pounds a minute, man I feel like I’m such a big shot
Lookin’ at these rappers like that’s what you do to get hot
I’m ballin’ with yo bitch, we pullin’ off, just left a big lot
Sick to your stomach, pull up Nigga, what yo’ bitch got
Tell this off the shop, I lost that roof like a month ago
I only did it cause these hoes said my money low
Bought another Harley cause my old one was running slow
If you ain’t talkin’ ‘bout no money, I don’t wanna know

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Rollin’, and I got 36 ounces with me
Some bad bitches in the trap and they countin’ with me
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown
Rollin’, and I got pounds in the back of this shit
A bunch of pills and I’m ready, ay bitch you know I’m heavy and you know
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown

[Verse 2:  Ruckus 100]
Bricks all in my refrigerator, Bandz all on my scale
They second guessed the work, but I knew that it would sell
I’m in the kitchen, washin’ dishes, with all the whippin’ counter clockwise
A lot of Niggas pushy, but not too many like I
This leather soft as cushion, so why not let this top down
White socks fitted, Tennessee tags when we come ‘round
’72 Monte Carlo, what you know about big blocks
Blood at the bezel, diamond the necklace, what a big knot
36 ounces rockin’ up hard, watch his bitch lock
DT patrol around the Calder-Sac, but don’t shit stop
All numbers scratched off the mac, we bustin’ big shots
All the bundles gotta come back, we can’t let shit slide
Buck, got me running all through the (Ca$h)'Ville, can’t slow down
Been a while since I seen 65, but we here now
I’m bogus, ridin’ with a bail, blowin’ on a stick of dro
You know it’s gonna be headache, don’t come with the mail, fuck the law

[Chorus: Young Buck]
Rollin’, and I got 36 ounces with me
Some bad bitches in the trap and they countin’ with me
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown
Rollin’, and I got pounds in the back of this shit
A bunch of pills and I’m ready, ay bitch you know I’m heavy and you know
My top down, gettin’ money, bitch I’m hot now
My top down, gettin’ money, got this shit on lockdown
