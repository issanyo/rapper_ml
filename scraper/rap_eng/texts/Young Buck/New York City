[Intro: Young Buck] (?)
No I'm not Jay-Z, 50 or P. Diddy
Nas and DMX or Brooklyn's own Biggie
I'm a dirty south soldier I hope y'all hear me cause
(Heart and soul of New York City!!!!)
Never met Big L or Big Pun
We only got big dreams where a nigga come from
Even with all the beef shit still look what I done
(Heart and soul of New York City!!!!) Here we go again!!!!

[Chorus: ?)
I can feel it, comin in the air tonight
Oh looooord!!! (Heart and soul of New York City!!!!) Oh looooord!!!
I can feel it, comin in the air tonight
Oh looooord!!! (Heart and soul of New York City!!!!) Oh looooord!!!

[Verse 1: Young Buck] (?) (*Young Buck's adlibs)

No love to them niggas actin bitch made

Big yachts, mansions, buyin real estate (COME ON!)

[Verse 2: Young Buck] (?) (*Young Buck's adlibs)
Gotta take what's mine make up for lost time
My kind is designed for the grind, we all wanna shine
Loyalty is hard to find
You got love for your dog nigga show him a sign (Yeah!)
Can't hold him in the grind if you wanna see him ball
Niggas build you up just to watch you fall
Now all of these celebrity hoes wanna get me cause
(Heart and soul of New York City!!!!)
King of my own castle, I'm a master (HEY!!!)
Stop and I'll fly right past ya, you knwo what I'm after until I get captured
When I'm in the casket like Ol' Dirty Bastard
Used to be a dream now it's me on the big dream while my homey never sae sixteen
So if I see Pac when the lord come get me I'm a tell 'em that
(Heart and soul of New York City!!!!)
