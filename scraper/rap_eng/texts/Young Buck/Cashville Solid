Solider heartless with ths AK you can't kill me
Im God's best friend, i feel when the devil near me
You can see it clearly, its death before dishonor
When it come down to the drama im the black osama
They hate me but can't break me, go head and seperate me
Cause the rap game didn't make me
The streets is what raised me
And i might get hit but i won't fall down
Ain't enough water for buck to drown
Ain't enough dollars im not around
Id rather stay home smarter now
Stand my ground, focus man
Swear that i'll never go broke again

All im sayin just know im here
Even though im not close to them
Whatever dont kill me make me stronger
You stop but i last longer
You hot but im pneumonia
Hard to get off when i get on ya
Still smokin my marijuana, my chevy still turnin corners
So clean u know what i mean, i am the american dream
My crown it can't be took, its cool im overlooked
My life can't go in no book, bredren bring in the hook
