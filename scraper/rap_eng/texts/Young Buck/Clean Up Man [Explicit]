Aiyyo, you niggas done ate long enough
G-Unit, oh
Ay, I'm the clean up man
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'
Motherfucker, they yellin', get 'em, Buck
Grindin', grindin', I can make it happen
'Cause I'm grindin', grindin', I ain't only rappin'
Man, I'm grindin', grindin', you know who to call
I be grindin', grindin', this is for my dawgs
What's goin' on with the Unit these days?
Well, I'ma tell you, everybody gettin' paid
And I hear you niggas talkin', prayin' on our downfall
Took a couple losses, still we some outlaws
Ya bitch still lovin' my swag
We let you niggas eat, why the fuck is you mad?
I never left the streets, I really ran to 'em
And since I know they watchin' me, I let my man do 'em
Money, a house and a bad bitch
Way 'fore the rap game, man, I had this
You don't know about bein' broke
Standin' on the block, sellin' fiends soap
Holla at me
Ay, I'm the clean up man
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'
Motherfucker, they yellin', get 'em, Buck
Grindin', grindin', I can make it happen
'Cause I'm grindin', grindin', I ain't only rappin'
Man, I'm grindin', grindin', you know who to call
I be grindin', grindin', this is for my dawgs
Let's sip the 'gnac for a minute
Shawty, you feelin' this, then put your back in it
I'm back in it in a all black fitted
In an all black tinted-up drop top Bentley
Like ayy, you know what it is
I got my own jewelry, baby, this ain't none of his
Just holla when you need me
Show a nigga love when you see me
I can carry the weight, 50, just put it on my shoulders
G-Unit is the gang, I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
They thought it was over, he let me out the cage
So now they got me standin' on this goddamn stage like
Ay, I'm the clean up man
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'
Motherfucker, they yellin', get 'em, Buck
Grindin', grindin', I can make it happen
'Cause I'm grindin', grindin', I ain't only rappin'
Man, I'm grindin', grindin', you know who to call
I be grindin', grindin', this is for my dawgs
Before I leave, let me put this on your brain
If rap stop today, I still do my thang
I bought a Benz way before I bought me a chain
Took my momma out the bricks and bought a car in her name
Paid my nigga, Head bond, just to get him on the streets
Hope if I get locked up, niggas do it for me
Keep the project lights on, payin' everybody bills
All my homies dead, I'm takin' care of everybody kids
And I got this, you can count on me
To come through when the home team down by three
I'm gon' shoot and even if a nigga did miss
I bet you next quarter, I'll be back in this bitch like
Ay, I'm the clean up man
It ain't too many niggas that can do it like I can
When them records ain't sellin' and the stitches start tellin'
Motherfucker, they yellin', get 'em, Buck
Grindin', grindin', I can make it happen
'Cause I'm grindin', grindin', I ain't only rappin'
Man, I'm grindin', grindin', you know who to call
I be grindin', grindin', this is for my dawgs
Yes, you know niggas out there, nah, nah, hold on
You know some niggas out there
Might have thought the Unit was over or some shit
You niggas is losin' your fuckin' minds, man
Aiyyo man, I got this shit right now, ya know what I mean?
Get the fuck out my lane
Yeah, you know, that's why that nigga 50
That's why he got his feet kicked up right now
Sha Money, I got you, nigga, straight up, so, oh yo
I'm expectin' to be at the awards this year, yeah
