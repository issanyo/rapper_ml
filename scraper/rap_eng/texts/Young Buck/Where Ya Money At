Get bank and live man lets find out
Now i'm a start it off cause i'm pullin' mines out
Got the hundreds on top and the fiftys on bottom
I'm throwin' money at the biggest baller when I spot him
I only want the bad bitches
No fat bitches
My homie Don Juan he'll be glad to hit ya
Do your dance shorty, turn around let me see it
Can it bounce for me well make a nigga want to eat it
Its that dope boy money it don't ever run out
When i'm finished throwin' this I pull the next one out
Catch up with me if you broke be gone
You can't smoke what we smokin' or drink what we on

And my whole crew caked up thats what i'm talkin' 'bout

I know they hate me thats why I do my thing on 'em
I swing my chain on 'em
And flip the caine on 'em
