[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
You thank you a killa, but we gon' just pay 'em a visit
Put the potato on the barrel, so no body hear it
I keep a holsta on my shoulda like I'm John Wayne
Shootin' these niggas lights out like Lebron James
Holla my name, gimme a reason to see you bleedin'
Afta you feel these hollo' tips, nigga - then we eatin'
Full of anger until there's no mo' bullets in the chamber
Ain't nothang like when you git popped and don't know who to blame-a
Nigga told me, "Do ya durrt all by your lonely"
So I go hit 'em niggas 'fore 50 couldn't even hold me
I'm waitin', anticipatin' to put a nigga unda
Smokin' like we some Jamaicans fuckin' with this ganja
Ride with no hesitation, retaliation is a must
Bad as I want to, some shit I just don't discuss
So point 'em out and watch how I knock him off
Err'where you bitches go - I got a nigga watchin' yall, motherfuckers!

[Verse 3 - B.G.]
It ain't easy livin' where the young die fast (Fast)
It's eitha rap, or take a penitentiary chance (Chance)
This rap shit too easy fo' me to go back
Ten fo' a piece of crack, fifty to rap on a track
But I ain't lyin', the streets call sometime
I could go to Detroit, sell 'em a thousand a pound
And git 'em fo' bout two-hunned in H-Town
Fo'git it, I ain't even goin' dat route (Fuck it)
I just do it like I do it, cuz the streets love it (Love it)
I hold it down, neva bow, gotta stay thuggin'
I don't be trippin' when the hatas go to mean-muggin' (Muggin')
I keep a strap in the hand so I keep stuntin' (Stuntin')
Now it's known by the whole world who a joke (Joke)
He ain't a man - got dreads, you already know (Wayne)
All my gangstas, gon' put ya hands up (Put 'em up)
And all my hott gurls, back dat azz up

[Chorus w/ Lil Jon ad-libs]
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), 2-4-5
Gotta charga on the boost, baby girl you wann' ride?
Wit a (Gangsta gangsta), Aye!
Yea dat's me, tinted out ridin' durrty - comin' down ya street
I'm a (Gangsta gangsta), Git triggas squeez'd up!
Got fitty killas with me, Strap'd down - G's up!!
