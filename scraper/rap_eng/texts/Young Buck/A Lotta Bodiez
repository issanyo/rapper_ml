[Verse 1: Hambino]

Certified boss, C.T.N. millionaire
Knock a nigga off, drop twenty racks on his head
Cheapest bricks going, bitch I got it snowing
Count it, two mil large, money overflowing
Niggas plotting on my life, trying to earn stripes
They got one time, cause if they miss, they mama die the same night
This city mine, [?], cause we don't pay the same price
They can't eat unless I feed 'em, success overnight
Now these hoes, they love hoes, love pussy, love me
And these owners, they know owners that own clubs love me
Cause they knowing when I hit the door, I know how to party
And every nigga 'round Hambino got a lot of bodies

[Hook: Young Buck]

Flag hanging, riding with my top down
Trap banging, chopper hold a hundred rounds
Bitches everywhere, they say I know how to party
And every nigga 'round me, got a lot of bodies

A lot of bodies [x2]

Teardrop tattoos, that's a lot of bodies

A lot of bodies [x2]

Y'all know our attitude, fuck everybody

[Verse 2: Young Buck]

Back to the basics, bitch I think I'm Yo Gotti
Maserati, two-seater, but it's four bodies
I can get your face blown and the case gone
My goons on speed dial, it won't take long
I'ma wait for 'em, set my bait for 'em
Happy birthday, bitch, bake a cake for 'em
Have that homicide looking in the lake for 'em
While Smith Brothers working trying to find a date for 'em
I know old killers, never been caught
Cut-throat, even knock they own friends off
The feds hate it but the bitches love it
She said she only fucking with the one that really does it
It's Buck

[Hook]

[Hook 2: Hambino]

I'm in Dodge City
Each and every day
You got a problem with me, bitch I'm coming with that K

It's C.T.N., homie, there is no other way
Fuck what you claim, we'll send you pussy niggas to your grave

In Dodge City Projects [x3]

We built for war, you broke-ass niggas ain't prepared yet

[Verse 3: Hambino]

[?] is my nigga, [?] and we miss you
Ham never goes with you, Dodge City bricks along with you
Fake niggas, forget you, and they don't even love the hood
Fuck around and get hit up, I'm 'bout to get it, understood
Y'all remember [?], well bitch, what about [?]
All we know is that killing shit, fuck your hood you hoes ain't worthy
Free my nigga [?], the DA got him twenty-five
Riding for his nigga, that's that real shit, cause we do-or-die
Gives a fuck about who would try, this just between you and I
Boy, I know your true side, cross that line and you will die
Fuck with me is suicide, you ain't on my level, cuh
Beefing with the truer living, God will buy you double, cuh

[Hook 2]
