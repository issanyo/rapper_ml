I love gettin money homie
Real talk - legal or illegal
Just addicted to gettin money

I try so hard to survive
Making money
Nothing but money on my mind
So ridiculous
I'll be hustling til I die
Family first, I love my wife
I'm so addicted

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
Addicted to getting money from the bottom of the barrel
I'm coming up for air
Got my hands in so many things that's keeping me right here
Spending time with my family, I'm fighting for my freedom
Y'all falling in love, I'm trying to fuck 'em and leave 'em
I've got my mind on a million, shawty, now let that be the reason
How about I buy you a house and we just call it even?
My partner told me he had a plug, I couldn't believe him
Cause he be lying, but this time he practice what he preaching
I love to see these young niggas shine
And me there eating
I hate to see the young niggas testify
Now let that be the reason
We be selling dope and thieving
Taking these grams around
Turn the hood to a video for MTV Jams
Rappers ain't clever no more
Oh you forgot who I am?
Cause I've been boxing with Uncle Sam
Blocking in my brother's land
Selling dope out my mama's house
Almost got my mother slammed
My definition of going to Hell
I'm addicted to money nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The trap bang and the set boom
I'm from where niggas get shot and show off their flesh wounds
I'm from where niggas get killed and whoever next to em
And bitches fight at the funeral trying to get next to them
He let the X do him
A small pill got 'em all killed
How they own supply, they never knew em
Just heard the gunfire
Lost in the money, and I can't find my way out
It won't work, she complains when I stay out
I can't leave, one move, I boom the yay out
And fuck the other baby-daddies and what they about
Pregnant bitch, mane, call the police on me
You can have the baby, just can't have me shawty
I guess it's me and this paper and bitch I'm cool with it
You gotta lose it just to find out what to do with it
You gotta use it just to find out how two did it
I still do it and dunn it
Addicted to money, it's Buck
