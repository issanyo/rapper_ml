[Hook: Young Buck]
I just bought me another bird
I had to put rims on my chevy
I got to put gold on my hoes
I got my weight up,I'm heavy
(i just bought me another bird)
I blew up back on a bitch
I am not average
I go on and grab the brick
(i just bought me another bird)
I be running through the bands
I'm just thumbing through bands
Whippin' doin' my dance
(i just bought me another bird)
(She wanna nigga with a check)(3x)

[Verse 1: Young Buck]

I'm only here to collect
We got work all day
Big bag full of bands I got shit to go and get
My trap queen is also thick,this bitch be having Channel fits
Birkin bags at the two's
She say "you so selfish"
I lift crumbs on the counter
I know I'm so careless
I got bricks in the bedroom and she don't know where it is
Dope-Boy,Dope-Boy,Dope-Boy
I've done grown up, momma, I'm a dopeman
I got pills in pints and seals ain't even broken
I took that white girl and made her bust it wide open
I put 16 in my rollie and I'm rollin',rollin',rollin'
Gave my BMW to my lil BBW
I just turn one in two I think I got a bird flu

I go on and grab the brick
(i just bought me another bird)
I be running through the bands

[Verse 2: Young Buck]

I wake up thinking about mula (money)
You don't let me niggas fool you
I know a lot of niggas getting money but everybody ain't a shooter
I just made my partner [?]
I just bought your bitch some pom poms
She telling me that she ready
I'm telling her that I'm heavy
I put that masel in chevy
I'm reading it up don't worry
I'm whipping it,whipping it,doing my dance
We call it [?] Halle Berry
We blowing the bag in a hurry
Me and the money we married
We fucking these hoes together
Ain't fucking with you if you average
Back in forth I be making run
She say the Porsche make her cum
I'm buying K's having fun
I'm buying Jays for her son
Dope-Boy,Dope-Boy,Dope-Boy
I've done grown up, I'm the dope man
But 16 on my rollie and I'm rollin',rollin',rollin'
