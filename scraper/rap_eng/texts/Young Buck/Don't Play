[Hook: Cris Streetz]

I don't got no 9to5 I be bustin all day
Mouths getting fed and them Bills getting paid
My nigga said I hope we leave the hood one day
I turned around and told him everyday don't we cake

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
Yea we chasing chicken gotta get it every way

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
As long as I got mine give a fuck what they say

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
My niggas got they blocks and they get it everyday

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
I show you what I'm bout I ain't into playing games
Don't Play


[Verse 1: Young Buck]

I got some homies that got CDL's
That only use they 18 wheels for bringing barrels
Some crack head cousins be constantly bringing sales
Bond money stashed well in case it all fails
Been shopping with the same n*** since I was like 12
Its time to graduate and start picking it up ourselves
Dope boy University Ima senior now
It's not a such thing as a misdemeanor now
Ugh
Just stay patient
We gonna make it through this weight station
You get hit when you forget how much time that you facing
Heart racing, shaking, they in my lane pacing
Speeding up slowing down but they gonna have to chase me
Taking penitentiary chances and I'm on probation
I sponsor everything and always making big donations
My first run honestly it was a proud moment
In 30 days I put 10,000 miles on it
Trappin

I don't got no 9to5 I be bustin all day

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
Yea we chasing chicken gotta get it every way

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
As long as I got mine give a fuck what they say

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play
My niggas got they blocks and they get it everyday

Don't Play, nah boy we don't play

[Verse 2: Cris Streetz]

S/o my connect, the real MVP  
Told'em talk to me nice 
He threw me one for free 
Threw it to my young n***s, yea we all eat 
Them boys more than ride than down to pop for me 
Love for my n***s, fuck my enimies 
Live from the Bronx, land of stacking cheese 
Land of fucking b***s turning up & then I leave 
Couple bottles & some hookas have her on her knees
Posted up we busting, watching for the D's 
Money be the motive if not don't talk to me 
141 st & Amsterdam getting shaped up
With real n***s laughing at you suckas play tough 
We flavor unit dawg, Malik seally with it 
I'm flossing extra hard so you can see me with it 
Them boys racked up, so you can see we get it 
Us NVR Them That's just how we be living
