[Young Buck:]
It's the Remix
Young Buck!
G-Uniit South!
Ha ha!
Hey yo, it's like I got a spot out in L.A
I got a spot in New York
And I just got a spot in the -A-
So shorty whats up?

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I want a freak...

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
Yeah show me what you got girl
I ain't from around here, take me to your world
Cristal and patrone
And you know it's on (Yo!)
A Gangsta Grill mixtape, just to keep it goin' (Uh-oh, Aye!)
Mink floors so you got to take your shoes off (Whudd!!)
It's more room in this Phanton than a U-Haul
Shorty said she down with it but she got a man
And she ain't really used to havin' one night stands
So what its 'gon be, show me where you live
Put your head down baby, let me see your grill
Gone on with your bad ass make them hoes hate
Well make up ya mind, real niggas don't wait (Nah!)
Look, what its 'gon take for you to break us all off
Never thought I'd see the day that I'd be askin' what it costs
The ice on my teeth got her starin' in my mouth
As soon as I find me a freak i'm out

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I want a freak...

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Here you go babydoll, take two of these
I'm a let the top down so that we can feel the breeze
Feelin' like a million bucks
In this Porsche truck
Got a big white cup
Full of purple stuff
Cell phone blowin' up
Yeah they wantin' Buck
If you ain't lettin' a nigga fuck
I ain't showin' up
In the strip club gone on that Grey Goose
These hoes crushin' down pills in they orange juice
Do your thang ma, I ain't got a problem with it
And when your finished, roll the weed up and i'm a hit it
Thats how we do it seven days a week
When you see me in the streets
You can speak

[Chorus: Young Buck]
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I need a freak (Uh-oh)
Where she at (Oh-oh)
Uh-oh shorty (Shorty), here I go
She really got to know how to get down for hers
I'm talkin' about freakin' everybody
I want a freak...

[Young Buck:]
So holla!
For real though
I'm out here baby
Hey you know what it is
I ain't trippin'
My baby mama ain't trippin'
For real though
I mean, you got to love it baby!
Young Buck!
Let's go!
NA, remember what I said
I need a freak
And I don't discriminate against niggas' baby mamas
Come on shorty (Gangsta Grizzille!!]
Do ya thang shorty
Do ya thang shorty
If ya see me in the hood
Do ya thang shorty
Do ya thang shorty
If ya catch me in the club
Do ya thang shorty
Do ya thang shorty
When ya see me in the mall
Do ya thang shorty
Do ya thang shorty
Don't matter where I'm at (Yea!)
Do ya thang shorty
Do ya thang shorty
