[Verse 1]
Now I'm standing here reincarnated
You lookin at a nigga they offered 10 wouldn't take
Can't now a nigga tell you I ever cooperated
I'm ballin' I know they hatin' shit I wasn't 'posed to make it
If it wouldn't for these bad bitches I wouldn't even be in here
If it wouldn't for you fuck niggas I woulda done been here
Outta control like I got bad brakes
Outta the hole and now I'm back and liftin' mad weight
Can't be one of them niggas who they say used to have cake
So I keep half plate, the other half bake
I handled it bitch I'm the man it was my mistake
I make it hard for my enemy to concentrate
I never asked you niggas once for my bond to make
If I can't get out on pre-trial then I gotta wait
She said she loved me but she left me when I lost it all
So I got married to the money, fuck all ya'll

[Verse 2]
Real nigga, no matter what the circumstance
You can make 100 million if you got the perfect plan
The preacher sell dope i'll never go to church again
Just pray to lord my soul you'll keep - Amen
Just to knock a nigga head off it cost a grand
So i am taking more than one with my second chance
Feeling like a young nigga they got bird money
Fightin' these cases it's been a while since you heard from me
Fuck a feature I don't need you all you rap nigga
Only reason i came to the venue is to slap niggas
I'm only here for the streets and the trap niggas
I fuck with real gangstas all over the map niggas
Came close but they ain't caught me yet
So I just copped a vette and set that bitch on off set
Niggas sayin I wouldn't make it hollerin off bet
I say gettin' to the money what you call that?
Just so you know i

[Verse 3]
Set it on fire but I didn't burn the bridge
I'm makin' statements to my niggas like don't hurt the kids
We all got kush packs but we purchase mids
Sent it to our niggas in the pen and let em do it big
I tell em that they second chance comin
And hopefully when they get home then I can hand em somethin
A couple niggas came home and I ain't hand em nothin'
Bitch niggas didn't shoot back and let em kill my cousin
I'm waitin' patient for retaliation
Stuck a choppa out the window at the gas station
I know hoes louie bag chasin
Fuck a nigga out his money, then replace him
You a sucka for love but she can fuck wit a thug
As long as she can understand I come wit a plug
We gon' be all white, sorry baby I'mma be all night
Some people call it crazy but I call it my life
Just so you know i
