[Intro: Young Buck]
Uh-oh
Young Buck
Dirty South, yeah

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear 'em talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch I get the club crunk; I'm a make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front?
Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty-South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm Cadillac'n through the hood, sittin' on 24s
TVs playin, rims spinnin, blowin plenty dro
Don't have to mention when you pimpin', you get plenty hoes
It's all on you if you go'n' trick or you go'n' get ya dough
I know I got these haters mad - I can love that
When you got love for the streets, they give you love back
Look in my eyes; you can tell I ain't never scared
Poppin' them thangs; I'm rockin my chain anywhere
If you go'n' represent ya hood, what you waitin on?
Security better back up when they play this song
And we 'bout 50 strong; please don't make us do you wrong
My clique is gorillas - they got they G-Units on
All of that mean muggin' really don't mean nothin'
Come on and take it outside; let me see somethin'
Wh-wh-what now; don't get b-b-bucked down
Stop all that hatin', or this club go'n' get sh-sh-shut down
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break em off

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear 'em talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch I get the club crunk; I'm a make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front? Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty-South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 2: Game]
G-G-G-unit! Coming straight outta Compton
Lace up my G-6's, and I'm A-Town stompin'
Got ten thousand cash in my pocket - let the pump in
Cause Luda and Young Buck always getting me into somethin'
Lowrider out front; I'm trying to get into somethin'
Step on Banks shoe one more time, and I'm a start bustin'
Rolls gold in my grill; I got a dirty mouth
And a bitch with a fat ass from the dirty, Dirty South
I wasn't trying to get the cover of the Double XL
Just trying to fuck Mia, cause Dre said sex sells
Don't be mad at the rocks in my fucking chain
Don't be mad cause your bitch chose Buck and Game
You see the logo tatted on my neck?
Same one I'm autographing on the chest
Put your bottles in the air for Yayo - he on house arrest
And on behalf of 50 Cent, this is G-Unit West
Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!
Now, stomp! G-G-G-G-Unit!

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear 'em talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch I get the club crunk; I'm a make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front? Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty-South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Yeah! Muthafucker, I'm a monster in this game
Similar to the Loch Ness
My rhymes are nappy rooted - some verses gotta process
The truth in this booth; ain't no doubts when I'm rappin'
If I say it I've either done it, or it's 'bout to happen
When I pull up in the Louis truck on 26's, people dumb out
If life's a crap game, I'm rollin' 7s on the come out
These rappers think I'm ig'nant, love saying my name
Cause maintaining my fish tank and they house cost the same
Ask me I say I made it, and it sho wadn't luck
But cause hustlers relate to me and some are younger than Buck
You see I'm married to my music but we got a pre-nup
So if that bitch don't act right, I'm still gettin' my cut
My deals never get screwed; my contracts practice abstinence
A master in this program, hazing these undergraduates
So pimpin', be easy; quit catchin' feelings
Cause you worth a couple hundred grand, and I'm worth millions
Nobody thinkin' bout you; plus your beef ain't legit
So please stay off the T-I-P of my dick

[Hook: Young Buck]
I hear 'em talking, but he 'bout to get that ass stomped
Watch I get the club crunk; I'm a make 'em stomp
We ain't playin'; wanna front?
Get that ass stomped
Do it like them Dirty-South boys do and stomp
Now where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? I'm a break 'em off
Where you from? Who the boss? Let me break 'em off
