[Intro]
Yea, Yea
Hey hand me that lighter right there, bro
Yea, Yea

[Hook]
I been in the car with a shooter (lawd how mercy)
I been sippin’ lean with a judge though (lawd how mercy)
Everybody wanna get high (lawd how mercy)
Everybody wanna get high
I just blowed a bag with a booster (lawd how mercy)
I been blowing kush with a crooked lawyer (lawd how mercy)
Everybody wanna get high (lawd how mercy)
Everybody wanna get high

[Verse 1]
In case you been up on Instagram all night, geekin’
Her baby daddy left with all the powder for the weekend
I don’t fuck with shorty no more, we’re not speakin’
The type of bitch get high and then lie for no reason
Mix the molly up with a Mountain Dew
Go ahead, I’mma hit the blunt after you
Percocets and a Porsche, herron and a Hublot
Cocaine and a coupe, how many real niggas you know?
Baby girl, I got blood on my Roley, I’m with the shit
You look at me too long, I might get you hit
Your brother didn’t know what to do, shouldn’t have took the bricks
And even though he's broke, this ain’t nothing that you can fix
You know how I do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I let my college bitch park the coupe on campus
You ask about a bale, I bet she knows the answer
She fuck with some nigga, play for the Carolina Panthers
He got her Gucci’s for her, now she like to throw tantrums
Kush smoker in the yellow gold diamond choker
40 in the watch and I ain’t got a rock in it
My partner locked in the pen until his time is over
They said stop, but some niggas just do not get it
Mix the lean with the Kool Aid
Then go count up all the money you made
The pack will land in 2 days, and you niggas got 2 ways
Either you gonna leave with me or you niggas gonna lose weight
You know how I rock it, shawty

[Hook]
