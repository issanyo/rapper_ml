Rapped up I got Benz on me
Benz Benz on me
Rapped up I got Benz on me
I got Benz on me
Ice over my niggas, I got cigarettes over my chick
I got bottles all in my section
This cash feelin we flexin’, ball
I’m still touching that white girl
All of my hoes just like girls
Walking through the club like a might earl
Miley Cyrus this my world
50 hundreds for this Bobby Jeans
45 hundreds for this time degree yes
Two chains gave me this pain to lean
Versace shades you know what I see
I got a gun homie, I ain’t even roll yet
A cope that I mean drove yet
Louie’s hatin’ even in the stove yet
I bet you broke niggas than you know that

Hook:
I read up, I ain’t never runnin’ out
I’m wrecked up, I ain’t never serving y’all
Get money, I ain’t never gone without, what?
So tell me why I don’t deserve the ball?
I’m just runnin’ that check up
I’m just runnin’ that check up
I’m just runnin’ that check up
I’m just runnin’ that check up
Coming through the Benz like this
Coming through the Benz like this
Coming through the Benz like this
I’m just runnin’ that check up
I’m still keepin’ that foldie on me
F*ck it fast ’cause I know you want me
36 O’s I hold it on me
We think we the shit, I know that don’t wr
Gucci bag hangin’ on my bitch on
Your bitch shit fin to get palm
My bitch rich and I whip hard
Look at my wrist I got a brick on
I got time for him and I ain’t even roll yet
A condom I ain’t even go yet
And mention I ain’t even show that
And guess you wanna know where your hoe at
My niggas got rich while I locked up true
And big homie, guaked up, guaked up
All of the soft got wacked up
Put benz on my hand when I popped up

Spend ’bout twelve ’bout my left nigga
And for my enemy .. f*ck em
Bear it out, whatever left up
Got white reminix in the pimps we ball
College bitch, shit the next of model
Pall all night I’ma wrist the model
Your baby mama shit, the next to swallow
Get on me, no yet, a pound to kush and I ain’t blow yet
And the next bar I ain’t sold yet
Tryin to find the house, while I can grow at
’cause aces spray no more at
’bout the fire this picture where the door hang
Hey picture me ballin’ and it’s a cold that
Tryin to find the script club and throw that bar
