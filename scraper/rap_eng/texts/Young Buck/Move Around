Remaking me move slow

Got a choppa by the front doors
Been here for years I won't go
I got a court date I won't show
I got a mortgage that won't low

But I met my plug in prison

But the work coming and the money moving
Neighbors looking but I'm still cooking
Don't worry bout what the fuck we doing
Look in the cabinet and all the [?] is ruined

And I'm still in this
Riding round right now with a life sentence
