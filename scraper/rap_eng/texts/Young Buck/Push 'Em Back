Ain't no body goin' broke, err' body sellin' dope
Err' body gettin' money, it's some niggas tellin' no
We ain't talkin' on the phone, I don't know ya, I ain't servin' ya
No body never heard of ya, you fuckin' wit' some murderers
Look at my wrist (Wrist!), look at my bitch (bitch!)
She hold daddy down, help a nigga get rich (Yeah!)
This Patron got me hot, the Phantom in the 'lot
See this pill kickin' in, and I'm standin' wit' my Glock
In this bitch like move, I need some elbow room
Got me spillin' liquor, why the club close so soon?

Cup full of Hennessey, my niggas call it Gasoline
Pussy niggas fill up, and say shit they don't mean
Stuntin' wit'cha real money, that'll get'chu killed
See prolly wann' this paper, my baby needs some milk
Bitch we built this city, the dope boy committee
I still got the nerves to sadle up and come and git it
A product of the projects, my momma's only son
Made my 1st million dollas, and a knew drama would come
Didn't run from it (Yeh!), I ran to it (Yeh!)
I'm not playin' bout The Unit, and my fans knew it
Now make a lane for me, cause I deserve this
I wonder what my enemies did when they hurd' this (Let's Goo!)
Ha-ha

Put'cha trigga fingas up, if ya wann' KNOCK THEY HEAD OFF!!
Pushin' weight, all thru the state
