[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Life's a craze, around a maze
My last days, to god's the praise
Stuck in my ways, I can't be phased
From the ground I'm raised, but now I'm out in a blaze

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
In the penitentiary boxing niggas out, Pa
Rest in peace to Khadafi, and 'Pac ain't shit without y'all
Smoking weed with Black Jesus at the last supper
'Bout to make bond for my brother, killed the undercover
I'm breaking rules with some dudes that shoot at one another
They love to see your mother suffer, and don't use rubber
Just getting get head from a **angel** in the Devil's house
Glock in my palm, reading the القرآن الكريم, trying to level out
My papa John having seizures, trying to keep him calm
They killed his mom, so he stuck the needle in his arm
I put the barrel in his mouth so he can't eat his tongue
To each his own, I'm just speaking on the streets I'm from
Robbing niggas for no reason
I'm god's child being peer pressured by all these Demons
It's hard to smile when you lost one and ain't got even
So when I say I'm living THUG LIFE please believe me
It's Buck bitch

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Life's a craze, around a maze
My last days, to god's the praise
Stuck in my ways, I can't be phased
From the ground I'm raised, but now I'm out in a blaze

[Verse 2: ???]
When my feet hit the floor, the Devil be like he woke again
Khadafi in my ear like "Dizz, I'm ready to smoke" and then
I jump up, stretch, think, hand mom a [?] again
Up under that 315, getting yolked again
Money over everything, even your manpower
"Soft" is a understatement, niggas is Clam Chowder
That's why my whole persona is 'fuck you'
And off of the fourth, I beef with rap niggas you now look up to
I swear I hear my life in they rhymes
Is it déjà vu? Claiming my dead homie like they my crew?
Set a stone crypted seat on fire, I bang snitches
Hussein, hand me the eighth, I hang bitches
Niggas get your history right, I been keeping it 200
You clowns wasn't listening right
And you can always find me where the dope at
And never be ashamed to be a real nigga, nigga, now quote that!

[Hook x2: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Life's a craze, around a maze
My last days, to god's the praise
Stuck in my ways, I can't be phased
From the ground I'm raised, but now I'm out in a blaze

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
With a rage under the surface
Calm and collected when I pull up to put in work
Things got ice water, ain't it?
I ain't been the same since my nigga took them shots on that Vegas strip
Fuck it, I had to keep it pushin' though
Getting high, watching time fly, puffing on Kush slow
Your look and the love is appreciated
But I still ain't fucking with them niggas and nobody affiliated
The big homie a O.G., yeah I show him well
I tell him "life is a bitch but she pretty as hell"
A fat ass, and a mind so lethal
A hunk saying you can have the pussy but you gotta be true
Most niggas don't understand that concept
They get jammed up, then send they fam up
When they got you, that's the time you s'posed to clam up
When they want you to lay down, nigga stand up

[Verse 4: ???]
Big game, hogging the strip
Puffing a spliff
We still M.O.B., never loving a, uh
Gotta be 'pared to use it, if you talking a'bliss
Anti-floss, the dirtiest niggas had the most tips
Clientele south into  the hollow
Felt bad serving my homeboy's mothers and they fathers
But they serve mine, know these ain't just rhymes
All my day ones remember the time
I'm Uptown, trip down on shootouts
Little niggas screaming "ma!", Claire whiling in the youth-house
Respectfully rep for the town
We were taught at a young age, better stand your ground
Creep up on your enemy without making a sound
Pop a clutch, 10 seconds without making it sound
We went from stolen cars, to spitting these frozen bars
Last of the Outlawz, chose from الله
This ain't a movie dog
