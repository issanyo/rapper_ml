Lemme see it (x2)

[Verse 1]
Errybody wanna flex up, like they check up so lets go

Errybody got Actavis, say their pouring up 4's
Errybody got plugs now, errybody move low
Errybody got pounds now, errybody move low
Errybody ain't around now cuz somebody just told
Errybody got bad bitches, errybody got hoes
Errybody got problems, shit errybody got throwed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't nobody broke no mo', don't nobody pay bills
Don't nobody snort coke no more, don't nobody take pills
Ain't nobody pour no mo', nobody know where nobody live
Errybody know who did it but ain't nobody getting killed
Now nobody giving nothing nigga nobody giving no fucks
Errybody wanna see the money, nigga we don't care if you Buck
Don't nobody wanna pick you up, nigga we don't care if you stuck
Don't nobody got problems, see that's where you fucked up
I got homies out here robbing, anybody get touched
Here errybody not like me is nobody I trust
Don't nobody wanna hear that shit, you niggas talking too much
What's understood ain't gotta be explained nigga, what

[Hook x2]
