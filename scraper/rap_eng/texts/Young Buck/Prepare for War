[Hook]
I got UZI's, and AK's of plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Everynight I make sure that im ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war

[Verse]
I got a heart like 50, and a gun big as Biggie
Some old heads hatin and some young niggas with me
Put a beam on a 12 gauge, buck, shots spread
I can aim for your legs, and hit you in your head
Like a soldier we sleep with our eyes open
We ride 4 deep and we trust no one
Heres the plan, soon as we finish shootin up ya man
We gonn' take it there, and start shootin up his friends
I dont know nothin but guns, I dont hold nothin but guns
I just know I got a gun, all yall better run
Im on the edge, to go out like them niggas with dreads
Do what I said, I come to take the bumbaclot bread
Did you hear that, its like death's in the air
When the wind starts holla'n and the moon light glare
Is you scared?, I can see the fear in your eyes
When we open up the door, and we caught you by suprise

[Hook]
I got UZI's, and AK's of plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Everynight I make sure that im ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war

[Bridge 2X]
Money, cars, cash and hoes
Thats the way, a gangsta roll
I dont know what you've been told
Where you been before, but thats how it goes

[Verse]
They say thats all I talk about is murder murder kill kill
But if I die today another nigga still will
On the front line marchin, to the battle feild
With a black hoody on and a pair of old Timbs
Ghetto sargent, I think I see the target
I hit them niggas up, but I dont know where they car went
The neighborhood love me, I buy they kids Christmas
And give em all money, to keep em out my business, no witness

[Hook]
I got UZI's, and AK's of plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Everynight I make sure that im ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war

[Bridge-Young Buck 2x]
Get your camolauge suits, and your combat boots
We ain't going to iraq, we just pullin up and shootin
Your life is what I want dawg, you can keep the loot
This is how the G's do, salute (salute)

[Verse]
Put the potatoe on the end of the round
Make the sound quiet down
The block dont eat if a nigga not around
Like a sniper, I keep my chopper low to the ground
Milatary minded, and im South Side now
Got my canteen filled up with henessy nigga
A bullet broof vest, and my tank on spinners
Attention!!, you about to enter a war zone
Why you come around here homie you know its on

[Hook]
I got UZI's, and AK's of plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Everynight I make sure that im ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets, and Tec 9's, and Semi's
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure your ready
And prepare for war
