[Verse 1]

I ain’t got a jealous bone in me
I hope n*gga’s get as rich as fifty

Cashville I brought my n*gga’s with me
Bandana’s and some blue dickies
I get rid of these briefs quickly never coming home if these Feds get me
I know baby I done changed game
B*tch I’m doing my thing game
Show a n*gga how to fall down and get right back up I could do it
We buying Glocks out the pawn shop I get them out the box hand hot
My youngest son selling rocks at the bus stop him hand pop
We running pussy n*gga’s soft got to be hard if you going to be selling soft
We got the gun come and wrap your own
You need a address for me to mail it off
These n*gg’as feeling some type of way
So it’s a few things I’d like to say
I don’t owe anybody nothing
Don’t like it do something n*gga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Grown man with his hand out
Got your b*tch taking her man out (damn)
Better come and get these 28 grams and stand out (yeah)
Look at him he just ran out (what)
Look at him pulling them bands out(bands)
All of my n*gga’s got court cases that they don’t give a damn about
I’m so deep in this cocaine
I’m a part of a family n*gga
Pulling up in these projects but I’m living like a Miami n*gga
I’m in love with this dope game I just got me a grammy n*gga
Swear to God I’d never open my mouth about what ya’ll hand me n*gga
Pyrex and a rifle plastic bags and a bible
Some white girls buying powder they be waiting on my arrival

Okay
