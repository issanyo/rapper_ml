[Chorus]
We don’t spend time to talk too much
Shorty don’t keep it real no more
But you already know (still my hoe)
She don’t come around don’t call no more
Even though we don’t ball no more (still my hoe)

[Verse 1]
Your momma never did like me though
Never knew what you liked me for
We f*cked good just the night before
I want to stay but I should go
Baby I’m just a drug dealer
I’m a buy you sh*t and don’t come home
I know I cheat but don’t get it twisted
This sh*t real our love strong
Your home girls ain’t happy
But they going to act like it but I know the truth
All them b*tches been trying to f*ck
So don’t believe what they told to you
You ain’t supposed to wait on me
You know what you’re supposed to do
Don’t you make me look bad hoe show them what daddy showed to you
She don’t f*ck with no lames now
She done stepped up her game now
I’m knowing sh*t ain’t the same now
She telling y’all to keep the change now

And you should go and ask your b*tch what I’m about
We still f*ck around I just called a timeout
Timeout hold up timeout hold up timeout hold up
We just need some timeout hold up timeout hold up
Timeout hold up timeout
I just called a timeout hold up timeout hold up timeout hold up
Timeout ( b*tches said I’m a make that p*ssy ) (I’m a beat the tushy) (I’m a eat her tushy)
Shorty want a thug all these b*tches know what I’m about
You looking for love and I just want some timeout timeout

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Your daddy still f*ck with me though
And your big brother still buying bricks
And I’m still giving them deals I can’t let you come between them
Baby I’m just a street n*gga ain’t no gurantee I’m gone be here
So I’m not trying to marry nothing but the money shorty let’s be clear
That p*ssy good I ain’t even left the house yet
Hard to leave this b*tch alone when that mouth wet
But I’m so focused now all I say is count that
She say she gone leave me
But truthfully I doubt that
She don’t ever see me and I don’t ever call back
She said the unit back together now you think you all that
You say you don’t need me so this time I’m gone fall back
We still f*ck around so tell me what you call that
We still f*ck around I just called a timeout
Timeout hold up timeout hold up timeout hold up
We just need some timeout hold up timeout hold up
Timeout hold up timeout
I just called a timeout hold up timeout hold up timeout hold up
Timeout ( b*tches said I’m a make that p*ssy ) (I’m a beat the tushy) (I’m a eat her tushy)
Shorty want a thug all these b*tches know what I’m about
You looking for love and I just want some timeout timeout

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah let’s slow it down a little bit in here
