[Intro:]
Yeah yeah
Gotta eat out here in these streets man
You know you start seeing a lot a killing and shit
It's called hunger pains my nigga

[Verse 1:]
I'm heavy in the game i'm a renegade
Forget this rap shit it's time to put the pen away
Compared to you i'm like a Porsche you a Chevrolet
Getting hella cake coming first like the letter A
I don't sweat it I just recollect and meditate
Ma intellect is superior to your featherweight
Summerset i'm straight what it is watch em levitate
Like half-baked you'll be flying from the center haze
Hard times but we on the road to better days
I drop pounds allday like i'm shitting weight
I simplified it till you simple niggas get it straight
I sell a lot of dope E hustle many ways
Laid back in the trap sipping Henny straight
Blowing cushy by the Ls how I medicate
OT to Tennessee we be setting flames
Swisha T young Buck this is hunger pains

[Chorus:]
We always hungry in the streets
Having hunger pains so it means we gotta eat
[We gotta eat] I want it all fuck a piece
Having hunger pains so that means we gotta feast
[repeat]

[Verse 2:]
Ha all I ever wanted was a big house
Bad bitches bagging up coke with their tits out
The shit we do to get out of the place called the ghetto
Where niggas get kicked out
Babies raising babies baby sister got a baby
The work coming slow so you gotta pay me
Canadian connect cocaine crazy
Doing 80 in the van wit ma old lady
Gucci scarf on ma neck it's the blue navy
Top drop in this cold nigga you crazy
WWW gave me
We going through hell but rather burn before you save me
Rap niggas just too shady
I spit it how I live it now you hate me
I get it how I get it and while you waiting
I'm on vacation while you niggas having hunger pains

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
All I ever wanted was a big stack
Get cash and if not then get the fuck back
It's all about paper you gotta get that
And I ain't talking McDonalds when I say I got a big Mac
Think fast we all in this hunger game
And y'all ain't the only ones having hunger pains
We gotta eat but we all don't feast
Some get nothing others barely even get a piece
So get it how you live it either live how you get it
We all tryna eat mother fucker don't forget it
Fuck being broke sell dope sell coke
It's the hope for the hopeless that's how we all coping
And all I ever wanted was the good life
You not from the hood you don't know what the hoods like
And all I can do is do what I do right
Even if it means that I have to live this thug life

[Chorus]
