(Verse one)
My 24's Spinnin', The Sticker's Still On 'Em
The Same Ol' Hoes, But A Nigga Still Want 'Em
I'm Parkin Lot Pimpin' On Another Nigga Woman
She Pullin Up Her Skirt, Tryin Show A Nigga Sumthin
Ya' Car Cloudy, My Niggas All Rowdy
This Heinesy Got A Nigga Drowsy, I'm Outty
Now Where Them Hoes At, Look I'm Tryin To Take You Home
So What'cha Got Ya Girlfriends, Bitch Bring 'Em On
Hoe I'm Tryin To Break A Bone, When I Get In Them Draw's
To The Window, To The Muthafuckin Walls
What A Nigga Don't Know Won't Hurt Him'
So If Ya' Got A Old Man, Bitch I Ain't Worried
And I Got Plenty Room If Ya Think You Wanna Roll
See This Is What They Make Caddillac Trucks For
Let's Go To A Place You Ain't Never Been, Down In The Country
I Bet Ya, I Have Ya Sayin' Ya Love Me

(Verse two)
My Shorty Givin Brain, The Liquor Got Right
It's Aight, Cuz, You Can Be My Wife, But Only For Tonight
Get Ya Ass On This Bike, I Can Show You Im'a Ryder
The 600 Coupe, With The Old School Wires
Geovanni Rims, With Perely's On The Tires
They Said 22's Wouldn't Fit, But They Liars
We Can Take A Trip To The Hood And Back
Then Go And Get A Room, How Hood Is That?
What'cha Waitin' On Shorty? This The Chance Of Your Life
What I Mean What I See In Them Jeans, I Like
You Don't Know What Your Missin', Just Quit Talkin And Listen
See I'm Just Holdin Up Traffic, We Just Right Here Sittin'
Think About It 'For I Bounce, And You Holla, I'm Wrong
And Ya' See Your Best Friend, In This Impala, On Chrome
If Your Ballin In Your Money Long, You Can Relate
But All Them Broke Ass Niggas Gon' Hate
