(Intro-50 Cent)
Yeah, I'm A Special Kinda Nigga With Mine's
I Grind, I Get's Paper, You Know What I Mean?
Hahaha, oh yeah

(Chorus-50 Cent)
I'm A Bonafide Hustler, Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

(Verse one-50 Cent)
They Heaven's For The Church Go'ers, And Hell's For The Heathens
So Im'a Just Ball The Fuck Out, While I'm Breathin
8th After 8th, What You Know About That Fast Flip?
Crack Spots, Smokey Fiends, Suckin On That Glass Dick
Man Sham Stay Askin' For A Dime For Nine
I Tell You What, I Hook You Up, This One Last Time
Custody's Comin', Son Is Pumpin, Watch The Packs Disolve
Singles, C-Notes, To Food Stamps, We Stackin' It All
Past That Joint, Whats His Name Son? I Dont Remember
The Haitian Nigga With The Guitar That Sang Gone In November
I Do A Buck 40 In The Rain, Hydro Plainin'
Lamborghini Diablo, Candy-Painted
Got That Hydro Burnin', Got The Burner In The Stash
Hit The Hazards, Hit The A.C., Then It Come Out The Dash
If I Go In The Club Son, And Niggas Start Dumbin'
Start Shootin N' I Ain't Straped, Fuck It, I'm Runnin'

(Chorus-50 Cent)
I'm A Bonafide Hustler, Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

(Verse two-Young Buck)
I Been Out Here For Too Long, I Deserve To Get A Bird
The Fiend's Know My Name Now, From Standin' On This Curb
I Got Blood On My Shirt, And A Hand Full Of Crack
A Bunch Of Lil' Niggas With Dime Sack's In They Backpacks
Come And Get It, We Got It, Take A Trip To The Projects
You See The Police, But We Gon' Sell Our Dope Regardless
Niggas Know Me, From Fillin Up Ya' Heroine Needles
I'm Connected With Them People Who Don't Speak No English
We Ain't Scared Of The Road, We Just Get It And Go
When You See Them Tennessee Tags Nigga, You Already Know
I Don't Trust No Hoes, Thats How 'T Got Pop'd
He Showed The Bitch Where His Stash Was, She Told It To The Cops
Me And Preist Had The Streets On Lock
He'd Break Down The Blocks, I'd Open Up Shop, 'Round The Clock
And I Ain't Gon' Stop, So Soon As You Come Home From The Pen
We At It Again, We Gettin' It For 10, My Nigga

(Chorus-50 Cent)
I'm A Bonafide Hustler, Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

(Verse three-Tony Yayo)
Now I'm Headed Down South And That's My Word
I'm On A Greyhound, 'Bout To Move These Birds
And If These Niggas Don't Let Me Sling
I'm Out There Robbin' Everything
Got A Brand New Mack And A P-89
Yay's A Hustler, Man I Stay On The Grind
9 Grams Of Heroine, 100 Grams Of Coke
12 O's Of Mushrooms, 2 Pounds Of Smoke
3 Gal's Of Dust Juice, And A Tank Of L.S.D
And A 1000 Pills Of Every Kind Of Ecstacy
Hash, Ha-sheesh, I Bought A '62
When I Was Younger With My Crew
I Had Them Niggas Sniffin Glue
It's 40 Cinnagrams, To Them Trucka's And Bammer's
And I Can Chef Up A Miricle With Arm & Hammer
I'm A Hustler, Man I Supply The Fiends
I'm A Hustler, Nigga I'll Sell You A Dream

(Chorus-50 Cent)
I'm A Bonafide Hustler, Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler

Nigga Get Outta Line I'll Cut Ya'
Me, I'm 'Bout My Paper, It's Fuck Ya'
If You Play Games With Mine, I'll Come At You From Behind
With My Nine, I'm A Bonafide Hustler
