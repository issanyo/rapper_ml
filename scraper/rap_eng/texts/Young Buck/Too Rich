[Intro]
Everything real life nigga, roll up maniac
You know, my young niggas really get money, really in the streets
We in here really with the check though

[Chorus]
I've seen so much heroin last night it got me 'noid, oh lord
Ooh, I think my bitch 'bout to get spoiled
I've seen so much cocaine today it got me 'noid, oh lord
Ooh, I think my kids 'bout to be spoiled
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done bought all new shit, switched up all of my whips
I done bought a hundred more sticks, all of this money to go and get, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1]
Count it out, these niggas hated on me but I'm bossed up
I'm right here with the gang members
Got four foreigns getting washed up
You got to watch the niggas hang with you
You done seen niggas trying to cross Buck
I done bought another Rollie though
VVS'd all my cross up
Lord, they done pissed off Buck
Do your thang, go and get off Buck
Them crackers had you locked up in chains
For a minute we thought we lost Buck
I've been right here by them bands, bitch
Should've never took me for granted
Later we gon' handle it but them green things just landed

[Chrous]
I've seen so many pounds of kush it got me 'noid, oh lord
Ooh, we 'bout to roll it up and blow it
I made so much money today, I thank the Lord, oh lord
Ooh, get what you want, I'm paying for it
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done bought all new shit, switched up all of my whips
I done bought a hundred more sticks, all of this money to go and get, I'm rollin'

[Verse 2]
Cutthroat, cutthroat, call me anything but broke
I've been laid back in a Maybach, staying way back from my truck load
Nigga weighing up the money
Gotta bring all my change back though
I'm not playing with the money
I plan on staying with the money
You never had your hand on a hundred
Had no idea when it's coming
Gotta drop everything you doing right then so I don't plan on nothing
I lock in, run that check up all week and pop xans on Sundays
Pour a four in a Faygo and start listing all my baby mamas
Fuck that, comma after comma
Now I've got pounds of marijuana
She don't want me then I don't bother
Run up a check and we don't argue
Go 'head, ball on them young nigga
Time for you to get out that Georgia
Gotta run it up right now 'cause we ain't promised tomorrow

[Chrous]
I've seen so many pints today it got me 'noid, oh lord
Ooh, I'm 'bout to pop a seal and pour it
I took so many percocets it got me 'noid, oh lord
Ooh, there's nothing that I can't afford
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done got rich too quick, shorty done ran me up a check
I done bought all new shit, switched up all of my whips
I done bought a hundred more sticks, all of this money to go and get, I'm rollin'
