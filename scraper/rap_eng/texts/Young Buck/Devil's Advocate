[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
The kitchen is my comfort zone
Water whippin' 'till I'm dead and gone
Constant ringing on my fucking phone
The kitchen is my comfort zone
The kitchen is my comfort zone

[Verse 1: Tony Yayo]
You need some flowers for the witnesses
Camo Ferragamo when I'm killin' shit
In the trenches real niggas better learn to squeeze
And do them niggas like Frank did the Chinese
Silly bitches keep laughing at my cell phone
My Boost mobile make E.T. phone home
2015 Caddy truck with the peanut butter seats
Turn that work to peanut butter, put it back on the streets

[Chorus: Tony Yayo]
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
These haters can't stand that I'm up
The kitchen is my comfort zone
Water whippin' 'till I'm dead and gone
Constant ringing on my fucking phone
The kitchen is my comfort zone
The kitchen is my comfort zone

[Bridge: Tony Yayo]
Bricks got a nigga real kicked up
Designer names got your bitch post weight up
They hate it when I'm up
They hate it when I win
My passport stamped
I'm going in to win
Eatin' quiche in the back of the G5
Lakeisha Rocksdale she from certain 5
Leave the hood with the hood in me
I'm so hood I like bitches with buck fifties, Pimp C

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Okay now fuck with it, you want it hard
You gotta come and get me, I'm not moving
I'm gettin' Novas I'm not losing
I'm doin' shit that you not doing
Got acid buckets right by the door, holla 5-0 and I'ma run to 'em
Might catch me with these couple pounds
But you can guarantee that them bricks ruined
No show dates, but I've been tourin'
Been ridin' round with no insurance
Got cannabis in my piss, so I take that bitch my friend urine
Medellin Yay' in this Stingray
And my son over 16, well I guess I'm a fucked up parent
Oh, cut that nigga no leeway
Still get it there with no delay
And I'm not hearing what she say
I put heron in her Honda
And I put that bitch on the free-way
And ya'll cut me off, the plug cut me in
I had cut it out and cut it up again
I had cocaine comin' up to the pen
I had the warden bringing that shit in
Eatin' lobster tail in my cell, sendin' racks out in my mail
Who ever said that you can't get bread in the feds, I can't tell
Right now I'm just on chill mode
Honestly, I don't need work
Dopeboy University I made a million off a t-shirt
It's Buck
