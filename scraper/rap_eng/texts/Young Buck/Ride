[Intro]
It is whudd it is.. Let's ryde nigga! (K'Yea!!)
'Chu niggas know about.. Slippin' they clips in AK's, nigga?!
I'm talkin 'bout hittin' niggas block!

[Verse 1]
I'm whippin' down my bullets wit' my bandana hidden behind tips (G'yeah!)
Tha beef 'bout to be handled nigga gimme bout 5 minutes (Owhh!)
I'm prayin' ain't no kids out playin' today
Cause I ain't trynnah see no babys gittin' hit wit' a stray
So if ya enemy is hidin' home then turn off ya lights
Then throw dis bitch in bar, we gittin' out tonite
I wanna look him in his eyes befo' he die
Some niggas git away when tha shells start to fly
We gon' make sure anybody out there breathin' gon' be bleedin'
Everybody out there leakin' then we leavin'
We git away, car parked in a dark alley (Yeap)
Just cut up thru tha yard, hop a fence then we at it (Yo!)
We off to tha next block, catch me if you can
Gunpowda on my shirt and some blood on my hands (Nigga!)
Neva thought I'd see tha day dat I'd be killin' me a man
Dis here fo' 50's enemies to make em undastand dat

[Hook]
Even tho we killed one and we ain't done yet
We rydin' on these mothafuckas soon as the sun set (G'yeah!)
Gangsta wit' it homie, you know how I do
Dis just a lil' somethang you can let off ya Glock too (G-U-niit!)

[Verse 2]
Clip in tha Smith & Wesson
And I done been shot but I ain't learnt my lesson (Yuh!)
I bought me some band-aids and hand-grenades
And I'd pull tha pin and throw it where ya familly stay
Dis tha hood mothafucka, not San Trope
You hear tha police sirens all Goddamn day
We huntin' fo' our prey, if we see 'em we eat 'em
And fuck tha D.E.A., they ain't takin' my freedom (Nah!)
So when you make dis turn, I'ma let off dis thang
Retaliatin' on dem bitches like Hugh did Kane
Insane, I'm tha black John Wayne
Wit' a chromed fo'-fo', put a hole in ya frame
Detectives found 'em wit' his watch and his chain
And some money in his pocket, a bullet in his brain (Ha-haa)
Neva thought I'd see tha day dat I'd be killin' me a man
Dis here fo' Yayo enemies to make 'em undastand whudd I'm sayin' is

Dis just a lil' somethang you let ya 12-gauge off too (G-U-niit!)

[Verse 3]
I'd be lyin' if I say I wadn't nervous tha 1st time (Phureal!)
But thankin' how they shot my cousin, I just buss' mine
Hard people glance, Glock burnin' my waist
Dis big fat ass officer ain't gon' win dis chase (Bitch!)
I'm paranoid but I got away clean (G'yeah!)
And I don't be havin' all them nitemare dreams (Nah!)
They say I have no conscience, my heart just (Cold!)
Cause I don't try to squash it, ya boy just (Roll!)
We hold niggas hostage, ya kid now hosed
Tha news to dis game man we play how it (Go!)
Tha Feds know my name so I stay on tha (Low!)
Every murda dat go down they knockin' at my (Do')
Gotta know whudd you doin' and how to shuffle it out
And once tha hommie go do it he gotta muzzle his mouf (Niggas!)
I neva thought I'd see tha day dat I'd be killin' me a man (Nah!)
Dis here fo' Banks' enemies to make 'em undastand whudd I'm sayin' is
