[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I gotta do (let's do it)
I'ma shoot it out with anybody too (true)
I guess they didn't hear me when I said nobody move (boom)

[Chorus]
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
Came from nothing, I just made the trap (boom)
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
You ain't nothing, you don't let your strap (boom)

[Verse 1]
Since a juvie I've been making movies with this Uzi
I don't talk like this usually but niggas done confused me
Shot it out with the best, I buried the rest of them
I know these niggas hate me, I refuse to let these niggas do me
Don't see demons, I have no nightmares
I did it all for a reason and who said life's fair?
My lil partner went in at 21 and he done got white hair
Keep telling me if he was here, he knew he would've been right there
Wish he never put his fingertips on niggas' clips
Loose lips seems to always sink a killer ship
These bitches flip, talk for that lil thousand dollar tip
These niggas get caught, and get hit all up in they whip

[Chorus]
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
Came from nothing, I just made the trap (boom)
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
You ain't nothing, you don't let your strap (boom)

[Verse 2]
Yellow tape around the bricks, they left somebody bodied
Picked him up and cleaned his blood up, it's just another homi
You picked up that chopper, young nigga can't run to mommy
Too many bullets been back and forth for me to say I'm sorry
Turn your T-shirt to a ski mask, and we blast
OG get a word and these young niggas do what he ask
Ain't no guarantee you making it back home (back home)
They say gangsters don't live that long, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I gotta do (let's do it)
I'ma shoot it out with anybody too (true)
I guess they didn't hear me when I said nobody move (boom)

[Chorus]
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
Came from nothing, I just made the trap (boom)
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
You ain't nothing, you don't let your strap (boom)

[Verse 3]
Politics, I seen niggas die for different shit
Before you get somebody hit, know who you got a problem with
Interrogation, detectives know you don't have common sense
They hit you with that you never gettin' out and you niggas snitch
Fingerprints, I told my mans don't touch it with your hand
They put that shit up under that blue light and fuck up niggas' plans
Evidence, when you go just be careful as you can
Do what you do and understand boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Do what I gotta do (let's do it)
I'ma shoot it out with anybody too (true)
I guess they didn't hear me when I said nobody move (boom)

[Chorus]
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
Came from nothing, I just made the trap (boom)
Cock it (boom), make it (boom)
You ain't nothing, you don't let your strap (boom)
You ain't nothing, you don't let your strap (boom)
Came from nothing, I just made the trap (boom)
