[Intro]
I know what the streets want
All the DJ's too
Haha, I told you niggas I'd be back
It's Young Buck, I'm back reincarnated bitches
(Let's Go)

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm A mess, I'm so different from the rest
And I stay in your system, so you can call me "X"
With two naked ladies, on these naked ladies, they get crazy
First she eat her, then she ate me, then you fuck her, then she pay me
Call It Pimpin'
But you ain't got A pimp bone in Ya
If you see A bad bitch go on get her
Ay, I done spent the whole day, poppin' Rose bitch
With An NFL player's wife, hoe's ain't shit
And these nigga's ain't nothin', If they ain't about hustlin'
All together now, tell these haters fuck em' (Fuck Em')
Somebody tell me when my album coming out
They said I've been snorting coke, and puttin' volumes in my
Mouth
(But It's Been)

[Chorus] (X2)
Gucci this, Louie that, buck back, I want it all
Bentley this, Chevy that, buck back, I want it all
A house here, A house there, buck back, I want it all
Put it in A plastic bag and let's ball nigga

[Verse 2]
They didn't Want To Give Us 50 Acre's And A Mule
So Let's Take The 50 States, And Paint The White House Black
(No He Didn't Say That)
Yes I Did Say That
From The Hood Where The Mama's Let There Kid's Slang Crack
Had A Truck Load, On An Underground Railroad
Would Of Shook The Town Down, But A Nigga Still Told
500 Brick's (Yeah We Call It Going Gold)
1000 Brick's (Now You Going Platinum On Them Hoe's)
Black-T, You Can Smell The Trap On My Cloth's
I Don't Rap At My Show's, I Just Tell It How It Is
Let Me Make It, Before The IRS Take It
In The "A" They Say Let's Get It, In The Ville We Say Shake It

Even If I Was Broke, I'm Still Richer Then You

Ain't No CEO, Can Tell Me What I Can And Can't Do
Okay Who Dat, Said That I Sell Coke And I Use That Too
It's True I Used To Do That, Now I'm Married To The Money
Where That Louie Duffel Bag, Nigga Carry Something For Me
I Don't Pay You Then You Hate Me, If I Pay You Then You Love Me
(Now It's Fuck Me) But Naw Nigga's Now It's Fuck You
Got Your Front Windshield TintedWhen You Come Through

I Mean Come On Ya'll, Let's Be Honest
Ain't I The Most Playa Hated, Under Rated
But The Most Anticipated Nigga In This Rap Shit
I Mean You Can't Lie Nigga, I'm Doing Me
Just In Case Nigga's Want To Know What The Fuck Is Going On With Young Buck
Street Nigga's Understand Me, Industry Nigga's Can't Fuck With Me
Real Nigga's Ride With Me, And The Bitches Love Me Nigga
I'm On My Way Though, Mixtape Coming Soon
I Would Tell Ya'll When My Album Coming Out, But Shit I Don't Even Know
