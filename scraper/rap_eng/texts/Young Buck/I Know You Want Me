[Intro: Jazze Pha]
Yeahhhhhhhhh!!! Poetry in motion man one take daddy
This is how we do it in person man
Ladies and gentleman!!! You are tuned into the very best
Jazze Phenzel Washingtonzel, Jazze Pha that is for all you numbskulls
Hey! Speakin of pimpin, that's my nigga Young Buck!!!

[Hook: Jazze Pha] (Young Buck)
Just hop in my ride if you want some (Come on!!!)
We can roll and get high if you want some (Yeah!!!)
Got it open and wide if you want some (Hey!!!!!)
I can see in your eyes that you want some (Let's go!!!!) I know you want me shorty
I know (I know) I know (I know) I know you want me
I know (I know) I know (I know) I know you want me shorty
I know (I know) I know (I know) I know you want me
I know (I know) I know (I know) I know you want me shorty

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
These hoes out here want me, let's get it wet
Niggas old ladies wanna fuck me, you should see the shit
I'm nothin like them other thugs, that eat it quick
Too many niggas in the club, I need a bitch
We park right up in the front, you see the six
I blew some smoke out from my blunt, and popped the cris
I gotta find me a model, I like 'em thick
I make her pop in my Impala, go take a trip
Clean up my shoe and pop my collar, I'm rich bitch
Oh what you never seen a baller, well this is it
I make that pussy feel good, till you tell me quit
And I won't tell nobody that you let me hit, psych!!!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Ok then shorty if you ready, then let's go
Let's take it from the dirty to the east and west coast
A couple shots of Petrom let's have a sex show
I got alot but baby you can be my best ho
I see you watchin a playa she like my dress code
Rockin these Cartier's drinkin that S.O
I know a place that we can go and get low
You with a gangsta you ain't never felt like this befo'
And if you want that pussy good, then hit the flo'
Shake thatass like you should, go get that dough
I make you love me if you let me, fo' real though
See down here we push Chevy's ridin real slow, so come on

[Hook]

[Bridge: Young Buck] (Jazze Pha)
Don't get scared girl show me what you got

Show me what you got, just show me what you got

Show me what you got, just show me what you got

[Hook]
