See I can make a horror movie with this warship movie
Or spray my name on the door of your fuckin hoop d
Fuck some jewelry I rock fifty chains for the haters
Most of these rappers get a Rolley from straight to Jacob
You know buck buying more guns than army
And keep one on me incase these niggas try and rob me
I'm sorry I'm not fifth in Corporate America
But your honor I still gutta tote a Berretta
I know a lot of niggas that wish they had one with them
When the money got dropped off the killers came to get them
Fuckin Pete got knocked off ain't nobody got a clue
So don't tell me I ain't doing what I gutta do
You know who shot at who when niggas tried and creep on us
Thought we was only talk and didn't have no heat on us
Watch these hoes man they fuck around and get you killed
If she don't put on in ya head another nigga will

When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
Hell ya' hey Bank$ bring em' straps!
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
G UNIT! you know where we at

The Desert Eagle stay stashed in the Buick Regal
A 12 gauge stashed in the back right beside the speaker
And I got beef but I ride through any hood
Christian Beyonce's 23's leather and wood
Ain't seen the block in a minute you know why I'm gone
Make sure the phene's still coming they know that I been touring
A ghetto nigga who still hang where he came from
Not one of these hollering gangsta when he ain't one
New York got a lot of rappers like to battle rap
I tell em' nigga I ain't with it homie grab a strap
My little brother like me he wanna sell dope
The Vice pulled him over he swallowed it down his throat
We all know the consequences when you fail to win
Half these niggas get out the pen the going again
What would you do if I told you it was a hit on you
Strap up? Or get rapped up? (ppplap) Back up!

When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
Hell ya' hey Bank$ bring em' straps!
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
When I shoot you shoot (Just like that?)
G UNIT! you know where we at
