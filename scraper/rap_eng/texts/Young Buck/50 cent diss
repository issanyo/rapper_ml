[Intro]:
Taped conversation
Streets wanna know
What Young Buck gon' do?
How Young Buck gon' respond?

[Chorus]
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)

Bitch niggas do bitch things
Look at 50 what he does just to get fame
Record my phone call when I spoke from the heart
That was a year ago
This was a joke from the start
You a ho, and I know
The only people record conversations is 5-0
Nigga I slow
Ciara go while you got a chance
Let a real nigga put a band on your hand
Understand I dont bite the hand that feed me
But I will if that hand say it dont need me
Look at y'all on TV
Banks look uneasy
If he told you how he feel
This is where he'd be
And they know, Yayo is stuck in your a-hole
Half of your staff only there for your payroll
Aye TIP lay low, you ain't gotta respond
He had the magic stick
I got the magic wand
I'm the don

[Chorus]
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)




Real niggas do real things
Real niggas never die, never give names
If a real nigga cry then its real pain
So I'm the real my nigga, I dont feel ashamed
Ain't no pussy in my veins, i'm a G
Without me ya'll just the U-N-I-T
Without B, y'all should just give it out free
Coz in the south we consider you weak
Nigga when I speak
The streets get relief
They really find the truth out about this beef
A victim of defeat when your album was released
When Jay-Z made Kanye look like a beast
BET told Jim Jones it was peace
Just tryna get some New York love at least
But they loving me
Im laughing at you while you worry 'bout me
When your punk ass respond I'ma give you verse three
Haha, you'll see

[Chorus]

(whistles) come here boy
Sit Bubu, sit
Good dog
Oh man I guess you must have forgot
Every man got an emotional side to him
Yeah whether he choose to show it
Or whether he choose to hide it
Haha
Dont make me lesser than no muthafucking man nigga
Im a G Fifty
So let me talk to your punk ass
Give you what you wanna hear
You know when you put that shit out
You should've told em that
That was a conversation that me and you had
Something like a year ago, right?
It was a heartfelt conversation from Young Buck
So yeah, they heard the emotional side of me
But they see the bitch nigga in you, Fifty
Believe that
Coz see like, nigga looked at you as a big brother, my nigga
7 years, I mean we done made millions together nigga
I followed your lead I should say, you know
So i dealt with you from the heart nigga
I mean I thought you dealt with me from the heart too
But now I know, yeah, I see
The devil in disguise
But we see now
The whole world see now
And I know you thinkin' this shit is making you look big
But you really look bad, my nigga
Look at what you had, my nigga
Hahaha!

[Chorus]
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)
If you see me in the streets rollin'
If you see me on the block holdin'
If you see me rollin' by
Remember that you don't know me
(You dont know me!)
