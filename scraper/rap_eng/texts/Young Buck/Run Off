[Intro]
Yeah they hatin', whatchu waitin' for
Run, they check up, they come right back and go make some mo
Get a bag, fuck the broke shit
Switch, whips, bought some more shit
Change, clothes, its a more licks
Fuck these hoes, bought some more bricks
Whoever said you ain't gotta have bread
Must've slipped and bump their head
I'm just sayin, they don't know shit

[Chorus]
Dirty money, had to do it, made me run off with the check
I walked in an out the trap, watch me run off with the check
I put niggas in position then we run off with the check
Blowin bags on these bitches that she run off with the check
Go to war with you, for I let you run off with the check
Go to plug, bitch I get it, I done run off with the check
Niggas, trap, trap, trap, then we run off with the check
Shawty, bounce, bounce, bounce, then she run off with the check

[verse 1]
What up dawg, bust a lick, I be really chasin' check
Street nigga, duckin' face, bitch I may just call collect
Bust a brick, bust a hit, bust ... what i get
36, what you say, I got 30 in this clip
.. and it's real, ..
Shawty thick cornbread look at how she moves her hips
Look at me gettin' money, dont pretend ...
I got gucci shit all on me and my jeans got all the rips
I just took your bitch shoppin' at Tiffany's (Had to do it)
Had to pay her back for what she did for me (I Had to do it)
Everything I pay for I can get for free (yeah yeah yeah)
Think I ain't fuckin' with the work, bitch you must be kiddin'

[Chorus]
Dirty money, had to do it, made me run off with the check
I walked in an out the trap, watch me run off with the check
I put niggas in position then we run off with the check
Blowin bags on these bitches that she run off with the check
Go to war with you, for I let you run off with the check
Go to plug, bitch I get it, I done run off with the check
Niggas, trap, trap, trap, then we run off with the check
Shawty, bounce, bounce, bounce, then she run off with the check

{verse 2}
Fendi, fendi, I got shoppin' bags in a bentley
I run through everything that they send me, can you dig me?
Hermes, Hermes belt I got it wrapped around my kidneys
My ... and all my Louie luggage empty
Diamonds on my teeth, I talk money when I speak
I'm clutchin' on my heat, paranoid when I get ...
I get it off the street, like my money stack ...
I take care of my kids and like to keep my bitch on flee
... penitentiary (100)
Make sure you say 100 when you mention me (100)
Bitch you .. for what you did to me (remember)
I keep runnin' up the check I know you sick of me, I got

[Chorus]
Dirty money, had to do it, made me run off with the check
I walked in an out the trap, watch me run off with the check
I put niggas in position then we run off with the check
Blowin bags on these bitches that she run off with the check
Go to war with you, for I let you run off with the check
Go to plug, bitch I get it, I done run off with the check
Niggas, trap, trap, trap, then we run off with the check
Shawty, bounce, bounce, bounce, then she run off with the check
