[Chorus x 1]
Buglar bars on the mansion window run it up
Bitch I'm up I dont sleep ho
Me and my bitch we dirty in this rental
I got a choppa and I'm peepin through the peep hole
What you think that I get geeked for
I'm so geeked up I'm dodging them people
Still getting geeked up
What you think that I get geeked for
We so geeked up all of us illegal
What you think that I get geeked for

I'm in the club with a stick
I filled up all of my pockets look at me I'm a walking lick
These are Margiela you wanna know what are thooose
You wanna know what that is thats going up inside her nose (She so geeked up)
I know some niggas got beat up they should never went put the heat up
A young nigga lost his freedom (Locked up) Fuck it lets roll the weed up (Roll it)

These bitches over here choosin' them niggas over there losing (fuck em)
We ain't been asleep in a week getting money ain't getting geeked
Jaw locking I don't wanna speak molly rocking I dont wanna eat
