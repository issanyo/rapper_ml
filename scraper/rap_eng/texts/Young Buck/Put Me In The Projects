[Intro]
Aww Shit, Its Ya Nigga Man
Young Buck, Lets Take It To The Projects
Hey You Know What It Is, Yeah
You Know What We Do Around Here Man, Cashville
We Get Money Round Here, Hey
In The Motherfuckin' Projects

[Verse 1]
Somebody In Trouble, Bitch Empty Out Your Pockets
Shot The Undercover For Coming Through My Projects
Chevy Sittin On 24's Hollin At The Block Ho's
Roll Slow Cause The Streets Full Of Pot Holes
Its Jumping Back When The Bakin Soda On It
And Ain't No Hard Feelings Cause If you Don't Want It
I'm Fresh To Death, In My Ten-A-Key Gear
Winkin' At your Bitch Tryin' Get Her To Come Here
They Can't Do It How I Do It, Had A Chance And He Blew It
I Can Dj Screw It Or Dj Clue It
I Can AK-Slay It, Make Whoo Kid Play It
A Gangtsa Grill On, Im In The A Where I Stay At
Niggas Got Me Fucked Up, Ain't Nobody Stopping Me
I'm Money In The Bank, You Think 50 Droppin' Me
48 Laws Of Power, Let Me Ask Ya
Is Rule Number 1, Never Out Shine The Master

[Chorus]
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects

[Verse 2]
I'm The Topic Of Ya Magazine I Don't Need Ya Cover
To Smart To Starve, To Hard To Struggle
You Think That I Don't Know That I Can Do It By Myself
You Think That I Don't Know I Got Three Albums Left
Chef-Boy-Arr D In The Kitchen Wit The Chickens
Gettin' To The Money That's Why Banks Been Missin'
Jimmy Won't Listen, Gotta Get Out Here And Get It
Start From The Ground Push My Label Independent
I Did It, C-Bo And The Outlaws Wit' It
6-1-5 I'm Gonna Show Ya In A Minute
These Niggas Pussy Whipped, I'm Just Whippin' The Pussy
Shit I Still Ain't Got Ova On What They Did To Tookie
Yeah The Feds Wanna Book Me But The Fourth Full Of Rookies
Hope I Never Get Caught Like A Kid Playin' Hookie
I'm Doing My Thing In These True Religion Jeans
Parked In The Projects, Sittin' In Something Clean

[Chorus]
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
Put Me In The Projects, Hey Put Me In The Projects, In The Projects
