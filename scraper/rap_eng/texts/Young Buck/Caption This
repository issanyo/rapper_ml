[Intro]
You niggas never listen
I'm just sayin' man, get your shit together
Check

[Chorus]
I been whippin' in my bitch's kitchen
We got him for his bag and left with no description
Run that check up, bitch I told you listen
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?

[Verse 1]
I got ninety-nine reasons I should leave niggas not breathin'
Pull up and just leave him, just say fuck my freedom
I'm trafficking my own sack, tell 'em I don't need 'em
Bitch I got my own back, I'm bustin' when I see 'em
Loco with the coco, I'm a dog with the food
I'm posting and my caption is what y'all wanna do?
Fuck them other niggas and the other side too
Draco after draco, y'all know I'm gon' slide through
But right now I'm in this trap

[Chorus]
I been whippin' in my bitch's kitchen
We got him for his bag and left with no description
Run that check up, bitch I told you listen
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?
Push the dope hole I got tunnel vision
Push your button, bitch it's no ignition
Run that check up, bitch I told you listen
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?

[Verse 2]
No, we don't walk around with beef nigga
Everybody hungry, all us gotta eat nigga
My booster bitches from the projects stay on fleek nigga
Real shit, real Gucci, real cheap nigga
Real bricks, real shooters, real street nigga
It's a jet, bitch where it's at?
Fifty twenties, do the math, it's a stack
I seen the paperwork, I did the math, it's a rack
I go berzerky with the perkies, hand to hand with the xan
C-O-D, you gotta bring your bands when it land
Can't let these niggas trick me off the street, bitch quit playin'
Fuck these niggas sayin', lil bitch I been the man

[Chorus]
Trap, I been whippin' in my bitch's kitchen
We got him for his bag and left with no description
Run that check up, bitch I told you listen
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?
Push the dope hole I got tunnel vision
Push your button, bitch it's no ignition
Run that check up, bitch I told you listen
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?

[Outro]
(I told you niggas get it)
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?
(I told you niggas get it)
Get your racks up ho, why don't you listen?
