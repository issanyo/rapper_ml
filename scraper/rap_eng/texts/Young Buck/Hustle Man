Though any way I get it I get it 'round the clock (what)
Cause the half assed hustle won't get you to the top (get some money)

[Verse 1: West]
They call me fabolous I keep a lil mo' (a lil' mo)
George John shh I keep a lil' blow (a lil' blow)
You can roll with me if you can keep a secret though
Oh she can be my hoe (if) she can keep it on the low
Don't try to send a nigga on my alley way
Cause he will catch a bullet from the seven like Gallaway
That's how you play? nigga I play harder
Pap? tought me ball from the feds like it's no tomorrow
It's 36 0's and they square
And 9 outta 10, is probably not there
But why should I care, I'mma put it in that pot
And bring it all back you can call it straight drop (get money)

[Hook: West]

[Verse 2: Young Buck]
I'm outta here, fresh up off the show room floor
Straight to the rim shop thats where them goons go
My arm out the window with the title in my hand
I put it on the streets and buy another one of them
The green get packed then we put it on the flight
And when they touch down I'm back with the reggie white
Push the brake hit the lights watch the whip do magic
Just left out the kitchen and I still do have it
I lost my Jacob but I found who had it
And I ain't gotta say what happen' just know I got it back
You won't catch me in the club if I ain't got a strap
And when it come to money bitch I got a lotta that (these niggas know)

[Hook: West]
I get mine off the top (hey)

[Verse 3: West]
Fresh new chain, G-unit jeans
Ten a key timepeace, swags insane
Just hop out the plane - in the BWI
And my homie east coop in the the 735
Ill I am, feeling like de?-on
Must be the money got the charm on free-on
Must be the 'cotic, got your broud cho-choosin
All in the car like, man who's 'oosin
Blades chopppin' like a fan
Know we got that contraband
Beat down like but I can still hear em what they sayin'
Cause I'm on that orange kush
Yeah I'll call it George Bush
I call it Bin Laden
I'm the only one that's got it (stop it)

[Hook: West]
