[Chorus:]
I’m still thuggin shit so fucked up it’s to the point that I don’t feel nothing
Don’t know what day it is all I know is the bills coming
Ain’t got no time to waste I’m tryna get this real money
And I know n*ggas that’ll kill for me
If they won’t die for me then I think they will steal from me
No matter where I be I see police I feel funny
Been round the globe and one thing I know for show the real of them

[Verse 1:]
A living legend not being signed don’t depress me
I take pride in being real in fact my city respect me
It ain’t the diamond necklace or the rolex’s
The Vill love me so in normal clothes I feel like I’m flexing
I talk slick enough to get the baddest b*tches naked
I hustle harder cause being broke does affect me
Don’t let no vice text me I know they want me arrested
I switch phones daily I know them folks tryna get me
I move so unexpected come to friends I’m so selective
Some n*ggas ain’t thuggin y’all n*ggas grown detectives
I rep Cashville in the way they won’t regret me
Introversion like Lito so please forgive me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I built this city with bricks boy
From the bottom n*gga I’m the architect
Gave half of these n*ggas 4 and a half ounces though and didn’t charge them sh*t
Some n*ggas don’t f*ck with me and it’s obvious I don’t give a f*ck
Broke b*tches try to talk to me but I’m too busy tryna get it up
Is that real I’m getting paid still
Selling pills like advils and I don’t give a f*ck how n*ggas feel
B*tch I am Cashville
Selling cane on trinity lane
Pimpin hoes on Dickinson road
And I’m standing on buck candy y’all know how this sh*t goes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The police gunning us down like it’s target practice
I swear this sh*t is sad and these young n*ggas trigger happy
I ain’t make it to graduation been to busy getting active
Can’t say I really blame them cause that could be a lesson
Everybody want to be a rapper everybody holla free the trappers
They throw the book at you before you can read a chapter
They ask why I’m introverted I think the weed a factor
Plus my life ain’t entertainment and I can’t compete with actors
Labeled some greedy bastards I’m thuggin it independent
This intermediation no middle man in my business
In Cashville I’ve been official
No rap’s getting beneficial
Stacking them rack and giving back cause I been there with you
They say I’m giving hope to the hopeless
Living broke got me focused
In the studio like in kitchen I’m whipping up cooking O’s
Cool let it congeal watch it all come together
Hard work pays off I’m trying to ball forever
Bought a car off the extras said it’s all in the wrist
Young n*ggas always at risk never thought of calling it quits
Still get followed and sh*t
Them people all in my mix and the car with a stick
I almost forgot I bought it legit
A street influence school of hard knock be the genius student
You know I keep the toolset
When you see me keep it moving
Bands like tears you advanced I don’t need it foo
I just took a chance at one plant

[Chorus]
