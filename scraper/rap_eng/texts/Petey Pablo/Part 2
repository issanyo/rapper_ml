[Petey Pablo: Talking]
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you today
The new album from Petey Pablo, "Still Writing in My Diary: The 2nd Entry"
The boy hot now; he been gone for a little while, had a little vacation, enjoyin' life
But that's what you're supposed to do when you get there: enjoy your life
Y'naw'mean, cause this ain't promised to us tomorrow, we can lose this shit tonight
Ya understand what I'm sayin'
But this young man that I'm bringin' before you today, has done it all
He's been at the lowest of the low, he's been at the top of the world
And he still remains grounded, that's a trill nigga, street cat
A fine young man, and I'm very proud to
Be able to say that I even know the young fellow
But without further ado, because I know you've been waitin'
Still writin' in his diary, the 2nd entry

My mama said, "Can you give her 3 dollars for a 5 dollar book of food stamps
So she can get her some cigarettes?" (laughs)

Ya see, I go through some shit called voice exercisin'
When I go in the booth, and I go in there
And I just lay a hook now 'n then, know what I'm sayin'
Like this shit right here

[Hook: Repeat 2x]
Time to take them shirts off again (put 'em back up in the air)
Represent, represent (put 'em back up in the air)
I really need you to mean it, mean it, mean it (put 'em back up in the air)
Start up that South shit again (put 'em back up in the air)

[Petey Pablo]
What you want this time, more fire?
No problem, I got it (I got it)
Y'all better be ready to call the motherfuckin' firetruck
To come up in this bitch an' put me out (yeah, yeah)
Petey Pab, back in the house, puttin' it down (I brought this fire, baby)
Stronger than we've ever been baby boy
Y'all in trouble now (now now now now now now)
If y'all ain't ready (ready), better find your door
It's time to go and y'all gotta get out
All up in the wheels and under your heels
And let the best thing to roll you out
If you been there, I ain't got to talk to you about it
It don't get more gangsta, gangsta than it gets in this South

[Hook: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
Got another rake, got another lawn mower, got another ho
A brand new weed wacker, with diamonds on the top where you hold
Got a water hose, and the thing you wind it up on
Carolina candy painted float to go with my pose
I be out there in that water 'round them rich white folks
Ain't caught me fish yet, but guess what, dog, I look good in that boat
I'm just as country as the day I was born, I love it
Say my name for me (Mmmmmm mmmmmm P-P-Petey Pab, motherfucker)
Bob your head, get your thang off, show your set
Look around ya boy, if that ain't there the South at its best
We run this shit here, all this shit here, nigga, look at me man
Your Jack ain't why you should be worried, it's the Ace in my hand

[Hook: Repeat 2x]

[Petey Pablo]
I'm sendin this song out to everybody that took the time when I ain't got my shit
Record store, bootleg, under hung and everywhere that my CD is at
I take my hat off, if it weren't for y'all, I wouldn't be nothin' at all
And Carolina would still be two states
Y'all motherfuckers used just to drive across
Do you see anything on my goddamn face that look like I'm playin'?
Have I said anything tonight, that y'all motherfuckin' niggas ain't understand?
Did I leave when I had a reason, talk to me man!
Naw I stayed, cause this where I was born and raised
(And I) I swear on everything I love
I'mma do my best to keep doin' it for us
And I don't need a gold or a platinum plaque
Just some down home country love (country love)
I don't ask for much (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Just enough to keep my honda crunk (huuuuuh huuuuhhh)
Tell the truth, it's really messin' me up
To see all y'all niggas still raisin' up (ooooooooooh)

[Hook: Repeat 2x]

(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Put 'em back up in the air
(yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) (Repeat 4x)
