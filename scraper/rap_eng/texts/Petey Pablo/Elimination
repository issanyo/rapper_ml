[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Creeping through the hood in a Carolina whip
Top dropped on it like it's Carolina clip
Bitches in the hood having a Carolina fit
He used to be skinny, now the boy done got hit
One record, two record, how many hit's
One plane, two plane, how many trip's
One hater, two hater, four, five, six
?????, trying to ride one dick
Y'all make me sick, mind over matter
But what ya' doing ain't shit, so to mine it don't matter
But what ya' need to do is quit, stop bouncing on the mattress
On a cheap ass bed, cause the springs can't handle it

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
No more nice guy (eliminating all the competition)
Shutting em' down now (eliminating all the competition)
Now I'm outside (eliminating all the competition)
B-b-b-bye, b-bye, b-bye, b-b-bye
Uh-huh (eliminating all the competition)
Uh-huh (eliminating all the competition)
Uh-huh (eliminating all the competition)
When your here has become your villain
Bitch, ya' feel it


[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Carolina did it, Carolina done it
Carolina bird man, number one stunna'
Back up in the building, hand to the ceiling
I got that rubber-band bounce back, pop ????
Hell of a nigga, look how he ride the rhythm
How he holla' just ain't holla, they got harmony with it
My coordination so coordinated that it ??, thought out and orchestrated
??????????????????
Vocals been depressed to the best of my ability
Now what's next
Leak it, put it on the internet


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
May I, get back to my, get back to my ??
And hit em' with that, hit em' with that
Hit em' with the street fire
I gotta keep it that way cause a
Every body know that I'm a certified street guy
Live as a motherfucking bird in the air
Trill as the motherfucking word is
Ain't nothing fake about him
Ain't nothing pussy about me
Go to the hometown, ? motherfucker ????
??? motherfucker been shocked and surprised
The type of nigga that they been around the whole time
Think about it, re-evaluate your ????
Ain't nothing but another ?


[Hook]
