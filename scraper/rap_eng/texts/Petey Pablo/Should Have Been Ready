[Intro] (Petey Pablo talking)
I ain't seen my dad since my Granddaddy passed
I ain't even been by the house to see none of em'
My Grandma or nothing
Ya' know, It was three of us
Now one of us gone
But there some unanswered questions pop

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
You and momma seemed fine when y'all was dating
She was seventeen you was twenty two when you signed papers
Gave her your last name
Last name
Why do I have your last name
If, you wasn't there to take care of the responsibility of the child that you brought here
Heh, talk to me Pop
I ain't being rude or nothing, talk to me Pop
I look just like ya'
I'm a chip off the old block
Ain't that what they say Pop
You know whats funny
Cause now I'm on top
And I don't need Pop
But I still acknowledge
See the problem was a problem
But it's no longer a problem
Cause now I'm grown up Pop
And you don't owe me an explanation
But I want an explanation
Why, because I want one Pop

[Hook]
Papa should have been ready
When you brought me here
But you wasn't ready
I'm here
I'm here
Should have been ready
When you brought me here
But I know you wasn't ready
To deal wit' it

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Word on the street
You was so fresh and so clean
Same way I am today
So fresh and so clean
Nigga' match everything
From a hat down to his shoestring
Had more ho's than ? had ho's (damn)
Understand me (un huh)
Bad motherfucker I heard
But I'm gonna tell ya'
Having a kid made ya' lose your Cadillac at the curb
I ain't mean to put a cramp in your swerve
You made me
So you know the traits that you passed on
I ain't a hater
Especially not on folks they call blood
How much blood in the father's in a son (huh)
Come on, you do the math
I dropped out in the eighth grade
I'm considered dumb
But I can't be too dumb
Cause I done "done" more things than you done

[Bridge]
You should have been ready
Papa should have been ready

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Cause I'm a bad son of a bitch
And I got everything that I want
And work hard for everything that I get
West Coast three whips
And I don't ask Simon to call Suge for shit
Spend my own chips
Rest of these niggas' be free loading
But I would feel less than a man if I asked a man to do that
And that's why I get the respect I get, BITCH

[Hook]
