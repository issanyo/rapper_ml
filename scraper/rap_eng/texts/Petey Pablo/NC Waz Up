[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I done did this, I did that
I done sold dope, ????
Now I sell records, I got plenty plaques
Check my track record, I defined Rap
I'm like a Rubik's Cube, figure out that
Twist and turn me, get my colors, try to make em' match
You'll catch a heart attack, man where the paddle's at
Man put em' on his chest (clear)
Can we bring him back
Even though I rap, it is not a rap
Seven on the first roll, that is not a crap
I live in Thug Mansion
The most expensive trap, you ever seen in your life
Can you picture that

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Wad up Greenville, we call it G-Vegas
Wad up Wilson, we call em' wide awaker's
Wad up Fayetteville, we call that Fayette-nam
Wad up Raleigh, wad up Durham
Wad up Charlotte, we call that Queen City
Wad up Concord, I'll pay KC a visit
Wad up High Point, wad up Hickory
Wad up Goldsboro, wad up Jacksonville


[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
East Coast, West Coast
Bad Boy to Death Row
I done been around the world twice and on my third go
Jingle Bell, Mistletoe
X pill, plenty snow
Corn Liquor, Oxycontin, motherfucking HYDRO
Shad Rack, ??, my homeboy ??
Donald Duck, Porky Pig, and Old MacDonald Billy Goat
Fifty foot yacht's riding 'side little sailboats
Down in the cabin making the ??????
What the hell you crying for, put this thing up in your throat
Close your eyes, matter fact, go get me a blindfold
No, tell you what though, get me a thing of rope
Take that stripper, tie her stripping ass to a stripper pole


[Hook]
Wad up Rocky Mount, wad up Wilmington
Wad up Winston-Salem, wad up Greensboro
Wad up Asheville, wad up Burlington
Wad up Chapel Hill, wad up ?
Wad up Cary, wad up Gastonia
Wad up Halifax, wad up Murfreesboro
What's up ??, what's up Kinston
What's up ? ? and ?


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I'm bonafide, qualified
Long paper certified
Folk think I'm out my mind, his sanity is borderline
I think I'm doing fine, thank the Lord I'm still alive
Whole lot of folk that dead and gone ?????
I'm like grapes that make the wine, I get better with time
Diamond in the rough, damn though how my diamond do shine
I just sat back and took my time, devised a master plan
Call me a Master Mind, little street scraper
Turned into a master grind
And I still got my shirt raised in the air like it was 99'


[Hook]
Wad up Hairdressers, wad up haircutters
Wad up Mailman, and Restaurant workers
Wad up Trash Man, wad up Landscaper
Wad up Secretary, and all my Section-Eighters
Wad up House Keeper, wad up School Teacher
Wad up Bartender, and all my in-betweeners
Wad up aspiring Rappers, wad up aspiring singers
And all my Martin Luther Kinger's, Dreamer's


[Outro]
