Do you want it from the back with your face
In the pillow so you could yell as loud as you want to
Do you want it on the floor, do you want it on the chair

[Outro]
Double-U boom boom beat
The radio station that plays all the new hip hop and R&B
That was the new "Freek-A-Leek" by Petey Pablo
Something to put a little razzle to your dazzle
A little pimp in your step
We gonna keep it going and we're gonna play another one of the songs off of the album
This one right here, one of my personal favorites
Featuring Young Buck from G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!
