[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I use to wanna be on Soul Train
Till I got up on Soul Train
And found out Soul Train
Was nothing like a Soul Train
Now I wanna push it away

I use to wanna be a Rap Singer
Till I started Rap Singing
And found out Rap Singing
Was nothing like Rap Singing
Now I wanna push it away

[Verse 1: Wes Cyphers]
We in the place where cat's yacking, busting for a fat sack
Your gat's packed, they hitting back
Spitting, you ain't getting that
I'm coming close to any flow that I kick
I'm throwing, ? Petey got me on tape boning your Bitch
I'm so sick, hit the button and get the buzz and hit the club
Mr. Martin the dirty rotten scoundrel that you wish you was
It's still Cypher, I ? and cock them steel pipes
Ya' feel Cyph
Knock your block off then ????
Oh shit, he done "done" it again
My mouth is fully loaded like this gun burning my lead
Turning your heads, like finding out your girl is "Les"
And Cyph got the bitch in the bed, spreading leg's giving me head
I rock with Petey, bitch
Cause when I rock with Petey
Petey got me on that verbalist shit
This murderous pen, ??????
A full course meal with ?????
Deserving you end
Son, the way you swerving the Benz
Let me catch you outside and curb stomp you and your man's
Fuck pretend, 'round her Son it's real now
It's real now
Motherfucker I said it's real now
So cut the bullshit
Fuck it you ain't fooling shit
Faggots, when you see us
Start shitting while you growing spit
And who the hell is you to charge and lean
When we the illest motherfuckers rocking, step in the game
Right through the door
Put your hair right on the
