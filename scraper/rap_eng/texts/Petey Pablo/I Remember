[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
You know folks still calling me wrong for leaving home
But I don't think I was wrong at all
Leaving home was the best thing I done
On account of the child I was
I wasn't neglected
Or mistreated or nothing
I was just stubborn
Didn't wanna listen to a Mother$%#$%#
I had a road of my own, I had to travel on
I had to get gone
I was too anxious
Wanted it too bad
Wanted it too fast
So I moved too fast
Never been the type to hold out my hand
So I had to go hand to hand
And hit the street corners
I'm a street runner
Didn't wanna be
But these things I achieved in the streets they look good on me
But at the same time I heard my Momma

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I can remember just like it was yesterday
Walking down Fairfax
Crossing Fifth and Fourteenth

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
A lot of folk talk bad about the Pin
But I'm pretty glad for the Pin
If it hadn't a been for the Pin
Wouldn't a had it in me to win
Probably wouldn't of been right here where I'm is right now
Learned some good shit from the Pin
Went in a confused child
And came out an understanding man
Now I can understand
I got plans
And I can see way across there
Cross there
Walk across foreign land
And just to think, it's the same little bad ass
That folks said gonna grow up to be just like Daddy
But I ain't
I only look like Daddy
Don't get me wrong I ain't mad at Pops
I respect my Pops
I read the Bible a lot
And the Bible says
"You honor your Mother and your Father
And your day's out here will be longer"
Check that

[Hook]

[Female singing]
Sitting in my room
When I got the news
That you had gone away
So many bags to carry
I think to myself
How will I ever maintain
My little brother needed me
And so did my child
Gotta stay strong
Beautiful
Gotta stand tall
In the midst of it all
Regardless of the circumstances

[Hook repeated]
