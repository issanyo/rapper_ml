[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
My Benz
My Vic
My Escalade and my Jag
I gotta house that sit up on the top a the hill
Way out there
Way out there

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
What cha' think about me taking ya' home
And letting you lay up in the land a Pab
Boxers, white tee
You got your panties on
Bumping Rick James on the radio
"Love them and leave them"
My nigga dead and gone
But don't worry through your music you gonna still live on
Cause I'm gonna keep banging every single one of your songs (yeah)
Don't take much to set me off
Turn me on
And get my little ding ding hard
Set the party off right like it's supposed to be done
A little Patron
And I'm a whole barrel of fun
That's right baby make me cum
And beat my balls like your beating bongo drums
Chitty chitty bang bang
I ain't said a damn thing
Bitch, I'm just having a ball

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Eastwood]
You know the Wood
I get's down and dirty
I flip's pounds a dirty
I'm with my dirty while he rocking his derby
I wanna see that body twist and wiggle
Just a little from the back to the middle
Now make it ? wit' chu'
I'm in a Benz
Sometimes a Jag
Yeah, you and your friends come
Hop in the back
Me and Petey stay hungry get this cheese and boss up
I flip seven key's and the money get flossed up
Got all my Row Rider's G'd up with their hood up
Sixty four Chevy car show with the hood up
Purple in my hand
It's the Kush
It's all Wood, bra
They love the way I keep Eastside in the hood, bra
Me, I'm Mr. Mac-a-llennium
For the millennium
With a house on the hills
On twenty sixes so I'm killing em', yeah
I'm just living in a baller's dream
I been doing big things with my big dog chain

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Carolina to Cali
Hill to the valley
Even my sticks yes an automatic
I'm the East Coast
West Coast new big daddy

I said
Mama I'm marrying baby daddy with Mary
And they still had a bad little bastard
Lil' John made another track that I done mastered
Goddamn this shit hot to death

[Hook] 3x
