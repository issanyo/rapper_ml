[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Some say this, and some say that
Some of it fiction, and some of it fact
Some say that I don't know how to act
Some say that I'm addicted to that
Whitney Houston say that crack is whack
And some say that I'm as whack as that
Career over and I can't come back
I should throw in the towel and let be done with Rap
Let y'all eat and take the scraps (imagine that)
Wither away, die in the trap (imagine that)
Tomorrow morning I'm gonna get me a tat (ya' hear that)
Smack dead in the middle of my back (can ya' see that)
That say

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Hard to kill like Bruce Willis, yeah
Hard to kill like Bruce Willis, yeah
Hard to kill like Bruce Willis, yeah
Willis, like Bruce Willis, Willis, Willis, Bruce Willis
Black Bruce Willis
Bruce Willis

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Hell, 'till they reach Hell
2Pac said
He won't scared, so why the hell should I be scared
Mama checking in my bedroom and I ain't there
I'm in the booth telling y'all shit that 2Pac said
I don't even believe that 2Pac dead
He got shot in the chest, the other nigga got shot in the head
He ain't die, he ain't dead
Knocked out a couple of times but he still outch' here
Over there, jumped in my shoe's straight outta bed
Pick up my forty-five, fill it with lead
Put on a fitted cap and cover my head
Hit the corner, make a right on red
I'm having flashbacks, thoughts of jail
Flip a coin, heads or tails
Solitary in a single cell, or
A Presidential in the Beverly Hills

[Hook]

Last one, come on

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I got both Carolina's on the top of my shoulders (I'm ballin')
And everybody in the Bank know I own em'
Split up the share's and lease out Porsche's
But a, it's real expensive, can you really afford it
Talk to your boy, I'll work with my folk
It's a recession Dog, I know that you broke
A little more weed, a little more coke to blow
A couple more feet, a little more rope
One more dream, and one more hope to ?
One more king (no)
No mo'
One shot yo, is all I know (?????)
With one Glock, Man your casket closed
Back on the road, forty a show
Thirty-nine and the answer is no
Or take the bottom, give me all of the dope you sold
Or all y'all can get the fuck on the floor
(There he go)

[Hook]
