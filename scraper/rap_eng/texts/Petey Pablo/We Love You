Oh, We Love You (repeated)

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
First come, first serve
Call me the early bird
Baby, I'm the Carolina first, second, and the third
Call me the street, block, corner, bench, and the curb
Hood certified, and swear to God I'll die for it
Call me the go-to man, I'm the one that it go to
And the one it goes through, Man
I'm the one that gave you folks my word
I'm the one these folks is looking to, to save the world (come on)
And I don't mean no harm Bra-brah (but a)
But Petey Pab is got a ???, Bra-brah (and a)
I can't see him giving up that hometown crown
Or that hometown phone
??????

[Hook] (repeated)
Oh, We love you (and keep on)

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Tall, dark, and handsome
Hometown champion
Carolina baller, like I played for the Panthers
Carolina needed a new anthem
So I had to hurry back home and enhance em'
Go ahead, advance em'
Put it in the street
Before a radio hand em, I'm gonna (put it in the street)
Before the DJ blast it, I'm gonna (put it in the street)
Man I'm finnin' to put my foot on the gas
Put it back in they ass, and in these streets
I'm finnin' to kill these motherfuckers, like I kill these beats
Riding through here in a burnt orange ???
Look, there go Petey
And hit the bar, buy it out and get em' high on me
And keep on
Get em high on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Shorty, I'm the man on two sides
I run the North and the South Side
Tell me I don't, I'll tell ya' you lying
Make me mad and rub my ears like ??
You're homie got a rep, but it ain't like mine
He can't fit my shoes, cause they the wrong size
Man I wear a twelve, you 'bout a eight or nine
Plus baby, I'm a suiter and I'm bonafide
I ain't gonna stop swapping out ho's, till it's dinner time
And I'm gonna stay chopping this wood, like it's winter time
And I ain't gonna stop ????????
Just like I'm gonna keep rapping for these folk behind me
Now look behind me, all I hear behind me

[Hook]
