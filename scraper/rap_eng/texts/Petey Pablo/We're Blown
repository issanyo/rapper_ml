[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Pu, puffing that Cali dro
Sipping on Patron
I got my mind made up, and goddammit we're blown

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Y'all can't touch me now
Y'all can't fuck with me now
Yeah, I'm up in y'all house
Now with a dick in your mouth
Whatcha know about doing these numbers when you come out
Fucking y'all bitch ass nigga's with no grease
Ain't scared of cops, I'm paying the police
Fuck what a song been saying about me
I'm only being what I was born to be
A superstar on the Death Row label like ?
Thanks Suge for nigga' understanding me
Putting Petey in a position for Petey to breath
Setting your motherfucking homeboy free
Holla at me dog, regardless right or wrong
I ain't nothing but a call away
Hit me on the horn
I'll be there to settle the score
This Carolina nigga' right here ride for ya

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, my Escalade
Down here, came out here
Jumped up in a new black Benz
Way out here, got me a few more friends
? Neckbone what the business is
Still trill, still got a house at the crib
Still own the house I growed up in
Still kick it with my folks and them
Every time I'm here
Cause, I'm just real to death
It's so ill at how I feel myself
And I ain't arrogant at all dog
Nah, I just know I'm blessed
Fuck all that bullshit y'all, I don't stress
I just sit back relax and give me that right there
Whatever that right there is
That right there
Therefore no questions asked (how bout' that)
Nigga' I'm grown, been grown
Been on my own since I was young, thirteen years old

[Hook] 2x

Yeah, yeah, yeah I changed up
Shit, y'all changed up
What y'all change for
Add that change up
Huh, cop me a barrel of buck
Hit the yard
And bitch go and battle it up
Monster truck, mashing on all y'all toe
You don't wanna get truck snuffed then back the fuck
Keep your hands off shit don't belong to ya'
Keep your mouth outta shit before you get fucked up
Keep your man outta her before your man get touched
It ain't Suge you got to worry about in here no more
He on parole, ho done rode this road
But me, I gotta ways to go

[Hook] 2x

Ooh!
