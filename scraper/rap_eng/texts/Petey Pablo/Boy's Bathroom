(verse 1)
That boy that love the rock
My homeboy got more sound than a goddamn jukebox
That nigga like 2Pac
Wanted to do derrty songs but one day (dont stop)
That boy gon hurt sumthin
When they come out at dis time watchin numbers
(money jangling) (5,10,15) while the money keep pilin up
Had to get another money machine
Cause the first one i had dont work no mo'
Hadda get me some new cars, with new rims and chrome bars
Kinda glad that they made a h2 with the button in the middle
I miss my uh-uh
Like i miss my grandma
With a crisco can on the back of the stove
Beda fry me up some catcus with a side of okra
Ya'll ready to have some fun?
Gimme a holla at the back of the club
I got that what they want
They want that bumpty-bump
I know what nigga shit hot right now
Dawg, but his shit is cold

(chorus)
Meet me in the boys bathroom (COME ON)
Meet me in the boys bathroom (COME ON)
Meet me in the boys bathroom (COME ON)
What you wanna do with all these girls? (COME ON)
Meet me in the boys bathroom (COME ON)
Meet me in the boys bathroom (COME ON)

(verse 2)
Big bird, big bird got a new flock
And when they flap comes over to the next block
We parked got our cars on the place
With the space with signs that say ain't no park
If i come outside and they boot my guys (so?) i just snoop doggs drivin
3 wheels go on one side, hard knocks, crank the 9
With a carolina baseball hat pulled down so the sun dont go in my eyes
We the type of guy the girl they dad dont like
With that ol colonge on they used 12 they come in here smellin just like it
My hand just banch the lightin
His daughter apples ripe
Just squeeze the dad out and pull one down and lemme just bite it
'whatchu doin in there with the lights off? yall get in the livin room right now'
Now i wish he take his ass to a motherfuckin bingo store (bingo)
He can make that mine my bad he forgot where he put the viagra (HEY!)

(i bet you thought the record was over didn't you?)

Coochie coochie ya ya oo

Uh-uh, you beda not move

When they come to you in a jam how they put you ina tutu
Ya name ring bells in the neighborhood
Best head in the whole wide world
Prettiest chest the all be gapin wallin
Almost make a nigga a he steal
Bet ya ass next time fore your ass
Come somewhere you ain't spose to come
And get tapped on till that thang come
And ya face swell up like it busted open
Trojan, hip hop got a whole lotta bump
Now get on outta here (thru them doors)

Good afternoon, my name is thomas jefferson leon-matthews the fourth
I am a resident of the carolinas
And has been a citizen of the united states of america
Ever since the day i was born
Um, i come from a small town called kenansville
On the other side of wilmington, north carolina
And i'd just like to say that
This, um, hippity-hop, um, (rap music) rap music
That they got in the communities today
Is destroying our community
And we could go to the store
We could buy (bread) tomatoes and mayonaise
We could get everything we wanted
And without worryin about driveby shootings
And um, gang violence, and i just wanna ban their souls to hell
I, i curse their names i, i can't stand the motherfuckers
I wish that..i..they're, look these fuckin dubs, and
HEY SHUT THE FUCK UP!
