[Hook- Petey Pablo]
I like em' slutty, I fuck em' bloody
I fuck in the ass, I love gettin money (That's my boy)
I'm just a dirty dirty, I'm in my early thirties
And gonna be like this till I die (Give me some more Patron)

[Verse 1- Petey Pablo]
You can't be serious, can you? Damn you
Ooh you fucking idiot, fuck you
Why do yo keep doing the things that you keep doing
Well first of all I'm a nasty motherfucker
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And all y'all can suck my balls (Your balls)
Yeah my balls
The thing that hang down on the bottom of the ding dong
Everybody got balls
Mine a little bigger than yours, that's why it look a little strange
(how dare you invite me to your scrotum)
Fuck you motherfucker ???
Motherfucker where your daughter at (bitch come on)

[Hook]

[Verse 2- Petey Pablo]
I ain't never fucked in the back seat of a car before, oh this is nice
What nice not bitch you got to be out your motherfucking mind
Ain't fucking in the back of my Cadillac, and they just reupholstered mine
I could feed fifty motherfuckers with these seat covers (how)
Bitch this is swine (ooh)
Get your ass on the outside and put your hands on the motherfucking bumper ma
Wait! before you do that, come here, bend down, open your mouth
Woo, unh that's right
Show me that you bout it bout it (you like)
Might keep you around a little while

[Hook]

[Verse 3-Petey Pablo
I like little titties, big titties, salty tasting titties
Titties just came out the club, sweatin, them type a titties
Loose pussy, wet and juicy, pussy not too tight
Pussy too tight, Pussy be burning skin off my wood
Too much friction
Too much hair on your kitty, bitch
Here take this Bic, take a razor to that shit (It's too thick)
Shit, that shit just knotted bitch
Use these clippers
And clean up all that evidence and let's get down to business

[Hook]

[Talking]
I know you didn't just pour my shit in no glass!
