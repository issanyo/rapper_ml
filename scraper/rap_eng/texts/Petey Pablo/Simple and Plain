[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]2x
Simple and plain this ain't no game
You fuck up, man and that's yo ass
You a snake in the grass, and my kids play in the grass
And I ain't finna' to have that

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
My tick tock's at quarter to seven
Black truck, my foot on the pedal
Banana clips taped together
And I ain't finna' to have that
This man decided to meddle in my business
And man I'm dying to get him
Down south Waffle House put me five on the griddle
No eggs over easy I'm a pancake flipper
Osama been tired a being down here sittin'
And I'm tired, cause I been sittin' down here with him
I got children, and I refuse to see my children
Get picked on, Daddy handle his business
My momma ain't raise no bitches
And my sisters a dike, so ya' know I ain't bullshittin'
And I know it's crazy hearing a nigga' you ain't use to hearing in six years
Six yeah'

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Concert's crazy packed
Nigga's standing back to back
Get back back, ya' bumping her tits
And she ain't finna' to have that
Ya best bet is to stay where you at
And don't move, next time you do it's a wrap
Whole dance floor is under attack
Nigga blaze the gat, anybody in the way getting clapped
You ain't have no business being in there
Should've been home with the pets, putting little food in the dish
Now you might miss Christmas behind this incident
This little incident, could left you past tense
Left yo ass, been happy yo ass been kicked up and down to this nasty shit
You son of a bitch, you two faced bastard
Can't stand y'all fuck niggas

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I don't know the dude that swung on Dre
Suge don't know the dude that swung on Dre
Y'all niggas better watch y'all face
Y'all niggas better stay in your place
Go back sit down, do this all off tape
Rewind this tape, find another album to play
Before I fuck around and spit in your face
I ain't afraid, ain't because of my feelings
Motherfucker I been this way, nigga I ain't gay
I say what I want to say, and can handle any consequences
The way y'all thinking, ain't good to be thinking
Especially when the main niggas think ya can't hang

[Hook] 2x

[Outro]
