[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Anything
I ever did
Ain't scared to admit it
I'll tell you I did it
If there's anything
I ever did
Ain't scared to admit it
I'll tell you I did it
If I
Did it
Did it
Did it
If I
DDDD Did it

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Ain't just high
I can touch the stars
And I'm riding around with a gun in the car
And a motherfucker got a warrant in Florida
And I think I gotta go to Court tomorrow
Fuck the Law
I don't give a fuck they can chase the car
Mine's souped up, nigga what about yours
I'm gonna drive mine till the goddamn wheels on the car ???

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Thirteen years old
Clothes on my back
I hit them streets
????
? Baltimore
Shorty leave that cocaine alone and try the dope
First time don't hit it too fast
Let me hit it slow
Bet it be the feeling you ain't never felt in your life before
Don't worry though
I got you though
??????

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Right is right
Wrong is wrong
Yours ain't right till your doing it wrong
Don't get mad at me, motherfucker
I'm being what I'm supposed to be, motherfucker
Love my life
Nigga, what about you
Secure with mine
Nigga, what about you
I do me all the time
Nigga, do you
And if you do, let it do what it do
That will do it

[Hook]
