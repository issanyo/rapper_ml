[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Everybody trying to make folk two step
What's a two step
Fuck a two step
One, two, step
Come on man
Get your shit together

Everybody trying to make folk two step
What's a two step
Fuck a two step
One, two, step
Come on man
Where my Gangsta's at
Where my Gansta's at

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I said I hit the track running
At about a hundred
A hundred or something
Or something close to a hundred
Rumble in the Jungle
When I come in where I come in
And I come in anywhere I fucking wanna
There no need to holster em'
My waist band could hold it
Or my Ace could hold it
Or your face could hold it
Police Stations on me
In every state I go in
In every car I roll in
Getting pulled over (pull it over)
I can't help but be a G
That's all that I can be
I can't go to the Army
The Army don't like G's
Or Ex Cons with felonies
And now I got plenty of these behind me
I been in the streets since I was a teen
Doing these crazy things
Getting things with bling
And earrings, gold chains
And everything else I seen on TV

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Knock Knock, who's there
Can't find him anywhere (who you looking for)
Anybody with hair on they chest
Think they can take this test
And at least pass it, with a average, of a B plus
Y'all youngins ain't old enough
To be claiming what you're claiming Bra
You don't run nothing but you're little mouth
And it might be running too much
And too much might be too much
I had enough
Time to shut it down
Sit down and shut up
Learn something
You little itty bitty titty sucker
Just finished sucking something
How titty milk smell spoiled
Little boys and girls, don't be afraid
You can leave me around your boys and girls
I ain't Michael and I ain't robbing
I ain't forgot about em'
Just ain't went to trial
He going don't worry about it
Folk's be talking about it
Just like they talking about Mike

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
(Come on)
I ain't dissing nobody
I ain't gotta diss nobody
Ain't nobody gonna do nothing to nobody
Y'all can come in
And I can show ya' how to get the party started
Fuck a bottle, buy the Bar
Tell the man to ? the car
Tell that girl right there come here
So I can whisper in her ear
And tell her something that she need to hear
You know what it is
I'm back in here again
I can do it again
Tell the DJ put the needle on the record

[Hook]
