[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Long distance (repeated)

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Man I'm a country boy to my heart
And I ain't trying to front, for nobody
I got a tat on my arm to show y'all
Any time y'all think I'm soft
You can walk up and get what you're asking me for
Trust that
Same trust that's on the back of a dollar
Man, I sure hate to make this forty five here holler
I hate to do it, but I can and I will though
Lying ain't right
Still, but fuck it, feel better than I did before
I don't take they medication no more
If I'm do a drug, might as well do the one that I want yo
Listen to the finger dog
You can't hear the finger y'all
Let me translate it
When that finger right there
Stuck up like that there
And it's pointed at the air
Mean same thing that it mean any and everywhere
Fuck you and everything you stand for out here
Got a fucking life and ain't did shit with it, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
What ya' know about your car being broke down
On the side of the road, Shorty
And I ain't stuck my thumb out yet
My head been in the motor
Man I been out here so long
My damn sock's cold
And I ain't got but two more smokes
You wanna do something than drop me off a pack a Newport
Keep going dog
I'm gonna get this motherfucker crunk before long
I don't know how I do it but I get shit done
I don't even know half the time where I'm going
Could ya' stop me
Hell no, I keep going
Like the little pink bunny with the big ass drum
Throw it to me
I'll catch it however it come
Even if I have to somersault or do a back flip for it
Man there's still two states out here sitting in the waiting office
Jive gotta fucking problem
So I got some drama for em'
Man I'm thirty six songs from being through
And I'm gonna show ya' how a bird do
When ya' turn a bird loose

[Hook]
