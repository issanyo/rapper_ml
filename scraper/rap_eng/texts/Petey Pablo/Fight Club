Yeah, yeah uh

Ship-stacked biddomb shit - gun up in the palm shit
Nobody moves, nobody get whacked with the contrict
Yo' shot at they concert, it's locked on the concrete
I'm Stone Cold, I mean I slap... then stomp...
Then what's to stop my .40 Glock from rumblin your calm streets?
I'm troubled when I on deep, loco enough for dolo
Blow holes in ya carseat and roll over ya Rover
Fuck this role model shit I'm finna blow out ya wig
Bitch! Throw bottles to kid and get 'em thrown at ya crib
It's the return of the worst shit that ever happened
Reborn like what's crackin, we formed with raw plastic
Blastin off ya doors with an awful passion
Forcin the walls to crash in
You see them kids, I'll make 'em all bastards
Joey Crack - keep it gully
Known to clap - keep a fully
Automatic mack whodie on my lap - doin thirty
Drivin through the Heights tryna find these cats that did me dirty
Shot me on the Ave., now I gotta blast until them pearlies

And we love to fight (BLAH!)

Crackin and buzzin with my Latin cousin Joey Grills

With that nasty-ass Coogi suit, lookin like pajamas

Put some trouble in ya voice homeboy, fore ya get whacked in
CALM (CALM!) DOWN (DOWN!) GET - BACK!

[Billy Danze]
For you niggas that wanna trap me
I make families unhappy
I'm tied into the same shit as Boy George and Papi
(E'RYBODY KNOW!) Everybody wanna clap me
Tonight I'm with my Spanish homie Joey
So get at me with the ghetto issued .45, semi-automatic
I (SPIT) with intentions (TO RIP)
Put-put pieces out yo' cabbage bitch
Trained on the Hill, aim at niggas faces
Push his hat back seven paces - leave him standin still
Cobra-ass nigga (Huh?!) You beg me to kill (Yeah!)
When I cock Glocks and pop, you beg me to chill (Chill!)
(Y'ALL REMEMBER BILL!) Y'all remember the motherfuckin deal
You will get yo' ass zipped up, how this feel nigga?!!

Two nickel nine, MacDonald, cup of richie wine
Wish a motherfucker would, look and he shall find
TEN MILLION WAYS TO DIE!

Ain't to many niggas round with the rumble
With the rawest in the jungle, blicky BLOAW BLOAW!!
