[Petey Pablo]
Yo son, another one
Your hogs are fat
I'm bout eat you up girl
The wait has been long enough
And I'm ready (Been ready) to freak the funk
Where that gravy, lick that biscuit
Let me get some hottie on toast with a pound of butter
No soda, no juice, no water or nothing
Junk man me till I pass the hell out
I want some slobber hangin' out the side of your mouth
I want some honey flow to the bed to the couch
I want some to the front to the back of the house
No phone, no 2-way, nobody trackin' us down
Baby mama, your baby daddy, Petey back in the house
Let me rub you down in hot oil and cocoa butter
Let's play hide and go seek and he can't stop stutter
Let's get past sleazy, take this thing to the gutter
Hey Joe bring that hook back and let me slip on this rubber

[Joe]
(This is the remix)

[Joe]
Girl it's been a while for us
We gotta lot of making up
Let's get into some sexy stuff
Ain't no need for us to rush (This is, This is the remix)
Girl I got an appetite
And I'm about to take a bite
So baby let's dim the lights
Daddy's staying home tonight

[Chorus: Joe]
Tell your girlfriends
Don't be coming round like if we be on the bed rocking
All night
Girl I'll have you in a heat
Steaming like a sauna
Girl I wanna show you love
Romance you till you get enough
Oh baby now let's stay home tonight
Can't you see that, that I need you baby

Girl here is where I wanna stay
No friends, no phones, no 2-ways
Oh let's stay home tonight
Don't you know that I need you (Rock the beat)

[Joe]
Ooh ooh settle me baby
It's about to get crazy
Gonna be riding tonight (Let's ride)
Cause you got a sexy way
So girl put on a show for J (No doubt)
And you know how I like to play
When we play (Uh huh)

[Chorus]

[Petey Pablo]
Oh no pager, no phone
Don't knock on my door
Just please, leave us alone
Nobody's home oh, oh, oh
No car, no keys no keys
I can't go, I can't
She can't leave, she can't
Please baby (Let's stay home tonight)
Baby

[Chorus to fade]
