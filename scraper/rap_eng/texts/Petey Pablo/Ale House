[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
Would ya' leave me alone (Would ya' leave me alone)

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I had a long day at work, and I need to get some stress off
Lot weighing down on my shoulders and I want to mess off
Almost told my boss to piss off and ripped his shit off
Punched my time clock and took my motherfucking wig off
Twelve pack of beer and a episode of Hee Haw
Called a couple friends, go to the bar and watch the kick-off
(Who playing) Who cares
Get out my house and cut my shit off
Leave my key up under the mat before it be lost

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
First I take a round of beer, then I take some liquor
Then I think I'll take a shot with everybody in here
Play some pool, act a fool, eat some chicken tenders
Then take another shot with everybody in here
Call my Homie, tell my Homie, Dog y'all come meet me here
(How is it) Man, it's off the chain
They swinging off the chandelier
And they ain't even got em' here, that ain't the type of place it is
(But if they did) Sure as shit, we'd a ripped them bitches outta here


Ale House
Could ya' take me by my Ale House
I don't wanna go home, ain't gotta go home
Could ya' take me to the Ale House

Ale House
Could ya' take me by my Ale House
I don't wanna go home, ain't gotta go home
Take me to my Ale House
(repeated)
