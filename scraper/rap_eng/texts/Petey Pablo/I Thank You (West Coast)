[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Getting in is for fit in's
And I ain't lost
And I ain't never tried to go nowhere I thought I belonged
I just took my steps, one by one
Where I ended up homeboy, is where I was
God already had the path laid out for me
Walking or running, homey I could get no further
And when the time comes he choose to call my number
May the world look back on over all I done
Good and bad, shit
Dog, cause I done "done" it
Judge me not
Let thy will be done
Sure had fun
Especially out here on the West Coast
Throwing it up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I take the penitentiary chance
Every single day he give me
And I step my feet outta my crib
That's real
And that's just how I live
I ain't trying to be nobody else, dog
I'm just who I is
Young and still wild like I ain't learned shit
But real spit, dog
That ain't what it is
I ain't got but one life to live
If your feet could fit my shoes
Your ass would of been in em'
I'm in a hell of a position
On a mission
And I'm gonna finish the shit as one of the best that ever did it
It took the West Coast to flip it
Blow the dust off this country nigga'
