[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Ya' know
When you can't talk about selling dope no more
Twenty-two's, Twenty-four's don't fit no more
And they realize, rocks ain't nothing but stones
Ten percent diamond, ninety Cubic Zirconia
The houses you televise, ain't your home
Cause to own it, you got to pay mortgage on it
When it's all over
Most of y'all ain't gonna have nothing to show
For what ya' had, cause ya' lost it all
Running round trying to play big dog
Keeping up with the Joneses
Dude, your paper ain't that long
Motherfuckers wanna hear a good song
Not how many cars ya' got parked in them White Folk's yard
That's why I can cut off, to cut back on
Jump slam off the same dude
Come back home
Hit the file cabinet, homeboy
Check my card, I been real since the day I was born

So now we got beef
Now I'm supposed to wait for good ass ?
Telling the whole world how dude hurt my feelings
Please
I wish I would let the Game play me
You gotta problem, send your record sales to see me
You can meet me after the session, out in the street
And I can give ya' anything you need
I don't talk about nobody, to nobody
Mine discreet
Can't 106 & Park, talk the grief
Then ya' wonder who the clown supposed ??
Tell the Engineer to go back and replay your lead
See, it's right there
Sixteen when they
Give ya' sixteen, take it from me
Handle it like ya' handle the streets
Said they was gansta'

Spend it like I don't even need it

Try three-thousand pair of sneaks
