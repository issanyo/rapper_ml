[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
If you want your name in the obituary column of the Newspaper
Your headed in the right direction

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I spit it like I live it
And everything that I say I did, I did it
(I really did it and I ain't just saying I did it)
Facial expression got so many expressions wit' it, can you feel it
(I can feel it, can you feel it, CAN YOU FEEL IT)
Intensifying by intentional ?, you better be easy
(Please take it easy)
Border line need to be committed
Should a kept me when they had me
But they didn't did they
(But they didn't, did they, did they, did they, did they)
Let's get down to the nitty gritty
And address any issues that might a exxxxisted
(It could be any, any)
You thought that I was something
Now you finding out I wasn't
What you gonna do now, now you know I'm coming
(I'm the realest)

[Hook] 2x
Fucking with me

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I ain't just been to jail
Nigga, I done been to hell
What you know about that
(I know all about that)
I done been to places where the wind won't there
And the trees won't even grow leaves out there
Y'all running round with your head up your ass
Ain't even got the slightest idea what time of the day it is
(What time a .....)
You ? niggas gonna make me go back to prison
All I gotta do is get in my feelings
And show you the definition of what a real nigga really is
You did do some shit you shouldn't a did
But you did it, didn't ya'
I know it's fucking with ya'
Don't let it fuck with you too bad
I ain't even bought my plane ticket yet, Bitch

[Hook] 2x
Fucking with me

Man, I ain't trying to tell y'all nothing but the truth
I'm telling you the truth
You want the truth
You can't handle the truth
Tell em' a story

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Once upon a time in a town called Greenville
Lived a little boy with the nickname of Petey
Petey was a little boy
That one day would grow up
To be a motherfucking fool in the goddamn streets
Cause ?????????
Had to go to prison like everybody in there
????, well would make him worser than he was
When that fool gotta rap sheet attached to him


[Hook] 2x
Fucking with me

Man, I'm trying to tell ya' something real now
Y'all playing games
I'm serious
Man, I'm serious as a Pit Bull with Aids
You ever been chased by a Pit Bull
Them motherfuckers got four legs
You ain't got but two
Boy, you don't want that
This the Proper Procedures
(fucking with me)
Oh
