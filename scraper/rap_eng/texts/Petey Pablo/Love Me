And we're back.. playing the hottest mu-sic on your radio
Coast to coast.. worldwide shore to shore sea to sea
I am your host.. DeBruca
And you're listening to the hottest radio station, in all the land
W-poon-poon-P..

What a revelation (lation)
You're the reason that I breathe
Innocent creation
I can use you as I please
The only one to tell my story
When words are hard to catch
Of all that comes with fame and glory
You let me rock you best
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooo-oooh, ooooo-oooh..

Such a sensation (sation)
Hypnotizin melo-dy
No limitations
I can stroke yo' every key
And you'll give me that do-re-mi-so
And sometimes double-time
And sometimes you'll love me nice and slow
Makes me wanna sing this rhyme
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooohh.. oooh-weeee..
Ooooo-oooh, ooooo-oooh..

Love me.. like I, love you
Don't you love me boo? Don't you love me boo?
Love me.. like I, love you
Don't you love me boo?
Promising, promising now, that I love ya, I love ya
I love ya, I LOVE YA!
I do love ya.. yes Iiiiiii do, yes I do
Can you love me, can you love me
Can you love me, can you love me
Toniiiiight, toniiiiight?
Can you love me, now can you love me
Now can you love me, now can you love me
Toniiiiight, toniiiiight? All I wanna say to you is
Can you love me, can you love me?
Can you love me love me?
