[Intro](Jano)
Old school telephone dialing
Burr!
Gee!

[Verse 1] (Jano)
Yeah I get it done and I rap too, (woo)
Finesse you out your cash but I had to, (my bad)
Doin' double white in the backroom
10 bad bitches all vacuums

[Hook] (Lappi)
Yeah my belly full of lean now, (haan!)
I got dealers on speed dial, (woo)
They can't answer when they beaned out, (woo)
Got your girl with the team now. (woo)

Got your girl with the team now. (woo) (team now)

[Verse 2] (Petey Pablo)
Yeah I'm stackin' real dough
Stack that paper from the floor
Bought a whole damn pound of blow
Where the fuck them ounces go?
Sit and watch the money grow
No I ain't your fucking bro
Fuck with me expect a throw
Young kid from Chicago

[Verse 3] (Campo)
Bitch I feel like Pablo!
We got the snow in Chicago
Nasty nine the fuckin' motto
You know we lead and they follow
My bitch she like a model
She suck me then she swallow

[Verse 4] (Lappi)
Fuck on the couch or the mattress
How the hell did this happen?
Brand name's been established
Yeah we flippin' and matchin'
Straight sippin' like savage
Jump in the pussy and ravage, (yuh)
Pop out this shit like it's magic
Pop out this shit like it's magic

[Verse 5] (Jano + Campo)
(Drr gee!)
Section doin' numbers no where near a gym, (bow)
Feelin' like LeBron when he at the rim, (ball)
I have never lost so I'm gonna win
Yeah I'm talkin' boss and a place to swim. (*waves*) (gee!)
Put the pussy on a pedestal, (ahh!)
Fuck around we throwin' bows
Watch your bitch I bang that hoe
Pass the bong, pack the bowl. (smoke)
Yeah I get it yeah I know
Now you talking to the show. (primetime)
Yeah I'm gonna switch this flow
Sellin' pack, takin' chops on the road
And I come with the meanest, (dog bark)
You know we makin' hits like Serena and Venus
Jabronis nice to meetcha
You know nothing comes between us...
You know nothing comes between us
