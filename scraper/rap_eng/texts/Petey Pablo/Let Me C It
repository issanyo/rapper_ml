[Intro]
It's Southern Smoke Mother Fuckas
Get cool in the building

Ya'll know what this is
Southern smoke

Go,go,go!
Go,go,go!

[Verse 1: Get Cool]

Bitchi step in the club so fresh
Money on my mind nothing more nothing less
I bet you can't pay a man to do it like this
Fresh new cut new dicks to impress
I fucked a dollar nigga he ain't crabbing
Pocket full of money no ya'll dont got to have it
You've got a man if don't go let me grab it
I gotta couple slacks in my life you can have it
I'm at the bar popping cause this bitch dont know
Put this drink on just because i get it for the low
My homeboy hit try to get it up late
I told him come later he can get later for the ass

[Verse 2: Get Cool]

Early in the morning
Fresh and still yawning
Clubs been jumping me and my niggas been balling
Sipping up vetron my phone is still calling
Ive been on the last survivor so i ain't falling
Lick my shawty real, shawty lick it at hers
Trying to figure out which one she gone cut
I'm just like a squirrel i just really want a nut
I'm the man with the plan with the game in the clutch
You can call me superman oh baby yes i get it up
I'll be in the ground above the dresser then i taaauuu
Wait for you to go to sleep then wake you up lets get it up
Take you to the shower then i might death eat you
Now let me c it

[Hook]

I ain't even getting this mother fucking club
