My goodies, my goodies, my goodies
Not my goodies!
I got a sick reputation for handling broads
All I need is me a few seconds or more
And in my rap
Tell valet to bring my 'lac
And I ain't coming back
So you can put a car right there
I'm the truth
And ain't got nothin' to prove
An you can ask anybody
'Cause they seen me do it
Barricades, I run right through 'em
I'm used to 'em
Throw all the dirt you want it's no use
You still won't have a pinup in a fabulous room
On her back pickin' out baskets of fruit
(I love you boo)
Yeah freak and Petey love you too
Ha ha
You know how I do
You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl
But I'm not just a young girl
Baby this is what I'm lookin' for. I want a
Sexy, independent, I ain't wit so you already know
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it

[Chorus]
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
Just because you drive a Benz
I'm not going home with you
You won't get no nookie or the cookies
I'm no rookie
And still I'm
Sexy, independent
I ain't wit' it so you already know
I'm not being too dramatic that's the way I gotta have it
You may talk slick
Trying hit
But I'm not dumb
I'm not being too dramatic it's just how I gotta have it
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
So damn hot but so young
You ain't got milk on ya tongue
Slow down lil' one
You ain't got it all
Hey shorty you don't play the game
You think you bad but you ain't bad
I'll show you what bad is
Bad is when you capable of beatin' the bag
I been workin' at it since I came to this planet
And I ain't quite there yet but I'm gettin' better at it
Matter of fact
Lemme tell it to you once more again
All I got to do is tell a girl who I am
Ain't no chick in here that I can't have
You're insinuating that I'm hot
But these goodies boy are not
Just for any of the many men that's trying to get on top
No you can't call me later
And I don't want your number
I'm not changin' stories
Just respect the play I'm calling
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mayb' 'cause I talk about it
Looking for the goodies
Keep on lookin' 'cause they stay in the jar
Yeah, yeah
