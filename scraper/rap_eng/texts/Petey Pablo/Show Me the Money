[Intro]
This is definitely the wickedest thing I ever hear in my life!

[Hook]
Show off that body you got
You got the dance floor so hot
You workin' that, you twerkin' that
You tickin' that like a clock

[Verse 1]
Can't nobody do it like I do it
When I do it, dog I do it
(Break it down)
Break it down, put your back into it
Man, y'all ain't ready for the **** I'm doing

(So get up)
Get up, put your drinks down
Don't want y'all sloshing yo' drinks out
All over that cheap blouse
Ain't nothing but a swallow in it anyhow

(Still me)
Still me, I just changed the sound
To the other one I had and just swapped it out
(Switch!)
Kept somethin' in background
Cause you love the song
But you in love wit the background

C'mon let a mama work for me
Make a player wanna spend some money
I don't really like spendin' money
But if you do what you do and do it well I'ma

[Hook] (x2)
Show off that body you got
You got the dance floor so hot
You workin' that, you twerkin' that
You tickin' that like a clock

[Verse 2]
Look good, and thick, nothin' in em, I'm hurtin'
No silicon, no lipo, no botox, no dumpty dump
All natural in today's world
When her mama brought her in this world
Good lookin' mama!

That good and hot and def make a athlete lose his breath
And if you got ass, move your little bump south
You're gonna need a couple skirts, fallin' out
10.5 on the Richter scale, the highest number you can go is 12

Shorty shake it like hell, we ought to be shame ourselves
The Creator couldn't rock the bed that well
Look at her breakin' it down ridin' this beat like wow!
If I was a jail man I'd gun her down

[Hook] (x2)
Show off that body you got
You got the dance floor so hot
You workin' that, you twerkin' that
You tickin' that like a clock

[Outro]
This is definitely the wickedest thing I ever hear in my life!

Ok!
I been sippin' on that Patron
I'm ready give you what you want
Might not feel the same way tomorrow
But I'll deal with that tomorrow

Cause tonight you got me feelin'
Like I wanna take you home

[Hook] (x2)
