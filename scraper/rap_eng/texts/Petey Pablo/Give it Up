[Girl]
Now ever since I was a little girl
I had a feeling of a naughty girl coming out of me
Now that I'm a little bit older, it's hard to control her
Petey whatcha got for me

[Chorus - girl]
You turn me on and I like it
Wanna get it on but I just can't
Give it up, give it up, give it up, baby
You got it goin' on and I like it
Wanna take you home but I just can't
Give it up, give it up, give it up, baby

[Verse 1]
6 feet 1, thick as a motherfucker
Sex symbol to some, freaky as a motherfucker
I don't need 'em all but I will lick some
And I don't gotta be that drunk neither motherfucker
Fuck money, I ain't gotta floss to fuck
All I gotta do is let her touch it to fuck her mind up
Peanut butter, caramel
Like 'em brown like a Reese cup
Pantie like paper and I usually tear the paper up
West coast women are a lot different from the East coast
Silicone titty, big nipples, only red bone
I know what they want see I know how to talk to 'em
And I know they want me to slip it in the back door
Only thing slow about me, I got some Luther
You just need to hold on
I ain't tryin' to hurt ya mama
I know it's your first time, tryin' to take it easy on ya
Speak for itself, whatcha think shorty

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Girl) You like it daddy
(Petey) I like it like this
(Girl) I feel excited daddy
(Petey) Do you like it like that
(Girl) I'm so delighted daddy
(Petey) I like it like this
(Girl) From the front to back but I can't give it up
(Girl) Now how you like it daddy
(Petey) I like it like this
(Girl) I feel excited daddy
(Petey) Do you like it like that
(Girl) I'm so delighted daddy
(Petey) I like it like this
(Girl) From the front to back but I can't give it up

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
Everybody wanna take a ride wit' a bad boy
I don't know what it is about you and bad boys
Bad boys do bad things, we got bad names
But y'all girls love us to death, I don't understand
Is it the way that we wear our clothes
Pants low by our assholes, hats turned back like so
Smokin on ganja, bullet holes in the escalade door, I don't know
But whatever it is that turns y'all on, keep turning me on
So as the world turns...
But you gon' learn, keep playin with fire and you will get burned
See I can lie to ya and make it sound fly to ya
But I choose to tell you this up front
We ain't good for nothin' but a night of good fuckin' and suckin'
So you might wanna pass us up, I said

[Chorus x2]
