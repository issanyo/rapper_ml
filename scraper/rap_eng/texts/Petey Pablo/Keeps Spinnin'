[Petey Pablo]
Now girl believe me I'm coming as fast as I can
Rims spinnin' like "rooaaaww" like I'm a North Carolina man
Well I can do the do's on deuce 22's
So make a mother fucker bowl move

[T.I.]
We in Atlanta, pimpin', ballin'
Every seven days is ballin' Chevys
Seven-four is Escalades on spinnin' blades - they sho is great
Hey Mannie tell these niggas how to hold these shoes
When the car been parked and the rims keep movin' (They keep spinnin')

[Mikkey]
Now in Chi-Town
Rims picking up every block I drive down
And on my lap that Desert weighing 'bout five pounds
Now don't be playing cause I'm spraying 'bout five rounds (Gun shots)
Get down (They keep spinnin')

[Stone]
You see that Lexus coupe? That Benz without the roof?
That Cadillac on 25's with skinny tires that's baby blue
They on them stop and goes
Them girls like "Watch him go"
Spinnin' chrome with this Killer Stone
Out the Magnolia with a Diablo (They keep spinnin')

[Chorus 2x]

[Mannie Fresh]

And when them brakes is pumping

And my rims keep spinnin' every time I stop

[Baby]

In my red Benz - flew up in my liter jet
I mean my red Beamer - its with that new (?)
Steering wheel in the middle (They keep spinnin')

[Chorus 2x]

[Wolf]
In that H-Town heads turning
Every corner that I come around
Hoping niggas grin, cause they love the sound
Of them big boys swishing
Them diamonds I stop and go
Sometimes I stop and listen

[Bizzy]

So when I stop they flow
So nigga watch your ho
I'm at the red light but (They keep spinnin')

[Gilly]

I push way back with the milli trigga
My rock are froze - I stop and pose
Your bitch all over my stop and goes
They keep on spinnin' and them hoes keep on grinnin'
But when my car stop my rims (They keep spinnin')

[Mannie Fresh talking]
All right everybody look at your watch right now
And pay attention to the seconds
I'm 'bout to pull up to the red light I'm 'bout to stop
And we gone see how long they gone spin (They keep spinnin')

[Chorus 2x]
