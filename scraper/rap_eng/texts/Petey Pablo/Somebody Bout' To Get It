[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Black Benz
Black tinted
Black nigga in it
All blacked out
Black Raider's fitted
Black nine mili
Somebody bout' to get it

Black Benz
Black tinted
Black nigga in it
All blacked out
Black Raider's fitted
Black nine mili
Somebody bout' to feel it

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I'm one of the illest that ever did it
That's why I'm still here
Looking at all y'all, like yeah I'm right here
I ain't scared of nothing cause I don't know fear
That dude ain't killed his Father
That there was God's will
I deal with drama like drunks drink beer
But not a gun
Only thing in here's air
Cut my own grass
Keep a lawnmower in my hand
When I walk a path, it's clear
I know where I'm at
Son of a bitch
Not momma
My Dad wasn't shit
I don't miss em'
And I ain't ?
Cuz, simple as that
I don't deal with em'
Really don't know feelings exist
Since ? died, I ain't even been by there to visit
Trill nigga, too real to not have kids
Wanted to wait till I was married
But who am I kidding
You gotta love a bitch to ??
Love ain't shit
Half the time a street nigga, he gonna think with his dick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I walk so hard when I walk across floors
And I don't even be stepping hard
I'm just trying to get where I'm going
Totally ignoring, screw faces and little comments they making
And ain't one of em' gonna say it to my face
And ain't one of em' could take my place
If they could, I'd a been bumped to the side
To reside, watch the race
To see the rest of the game
Head hung down
With nothing to save me
Yeah that's crazy
Not loose to say it, Crazy
Documented, and written on paper
They ain't use to me
Being a certain way
Now I changed, they can't accept the changes
Cause I made a few changes
The changes I made
Gonna leave me straight for the rest of my days
Biggest fucking Death Row Man, ever been made
Hanging on the end of my chain
Now that's crazy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
If you had the right type of get hype tonight
Might be the night, yo' ass might get D.C. sniped
By a new type of sniper
Carolina Piper
I know it's illegal for me carrying this type a
Military issued pistol
But fuck it, I like it
Send the police to my car and find it
I know where to hide them
But not under the seat
Right here on my lap
So the punk bitch can see it

[Hook]
