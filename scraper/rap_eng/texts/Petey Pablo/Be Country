I'm gonna be country till the day i die
Just because i got this and that
And moved out from the projects
Don't mean i forgot

I'm gonna be country till the day i die
To the deep and depth of my soul
From the top of my head
Down to my air forceones
Til the day i die
Just because i got this and that
And moved out from the projects
Don't mean i forgot

Down to my air forceones
Til the day i die
Just because i got this and that
And moved out from the projects
Don't mean i forgot

Taking me on the road with you
Showing me the finer things in life
