When he spoke to me
(his spoken..so sweet so sweet..yeah)
Just the sound of the voice
When he spoke to me

-Verse-
Sound of a god, send that chill down my body
Now i was lifting, i tried to deny the ways i was feeling
Cos the world had me all messed up controlling my decisions
Had me at the point where i hated who i was, something had a hold on me, and wouldn't budge at all, i felt myself sinking, until this all, now all i could say was 'help me lord', and by god it hurted, i know it hurt because

When he spoke to me
(his spoken..so sweet so sweet..yeah)
Just the sound of the voice
When he spoke to me

Sound of a god, send that chill down my body
Now i was lifting
(shhhhh..wait a minute)
Just when i thought it was over
(shhhhh..wait a minute)
N'i was bout to through in the towel
My heart was heavy, with a bird left being a bird in the world and not being able to fly, my heart was heavy
(so heavy..so heavy)
And if you don't know what i'm talking about then you must be crazy
(you need to stand up (x6)
God his got windows
(ain't that wit you)
You better stand up (x4)

(his spoken..so sweet so sweet..yeah)
Just the sound of the voice
When he spoke to me

Sound of a god, send that chill down my body
Now i was lifting

Just the sound of the voice
When he spoke to me

Sound of a god, send that chill down my body
Now i was lifting
