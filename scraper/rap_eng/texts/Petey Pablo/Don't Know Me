[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Till y'all been where I been
Till y'all did what I did
Fall back bitch, tell your hating ass homeboy
Fall back bitch, just in case he ain't here to hear it

Till y'all gone where I gone
Till y'all top what I sold
Fall back bitch, move back
Fall back bitch, I hate to have to do that Boy

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
If a nigga got a lot to lose if I hit him
How much I got to lose if I kill him
Might as well go all out if I'm gonna get him
Ain't worth a damn to start and don't ?
Might as well let him feel my ass if I forgive him
Walk around dressing in drag, not living
??? suppose to live that lifestyle their living
I'm merely making my point
(You) feel me
Nervous System, really never knew the fucking definition
Of what the hell is a Nervous System
Mine ain't never been near ??

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Never claimed that I was invincible, not once
Bulletproof I am not, I've been shot
Motherfucker that did it though, guess what
Can't tell a nigga he did it, and guess what
Six feet of dirt keep a motherfucker mouth shut
Tighter than a bodybuilder in a little bitty shirt
(I ain't pull the trigger so)
Telling the Man won't work
(would a did the nigga)
But another nigga got him first
(I wish)
Wouldn't had a did him cause the shit I had for him
He'd a still been here reminiscing about a loved one
Young Blood
Fuck 'round bring out the other motherfucker I want for
Come on

Top light security of the world Carolina
Not just the city, the world Carolina
Need security in the world Carolina

[Hook]
