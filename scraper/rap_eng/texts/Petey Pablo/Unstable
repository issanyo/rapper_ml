[Intro: Petey Pablo talking]
You know I never really cared for rap music too much
Um, I'm kinda country, hard rock kinda dude
Soft rock, I don't wanna listen to too much hard rock either
Um, It's just, It's just too difficult to deal with

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Get off my front porch, lock my screen door
Cut my phone off, light my Newport
Away my drink goes
Pour out a little bit for all the lost souls and fallen soldiers
Turn my light off, go in the studio
Beat on the keyboard, make me a rap song
Pour out problems, add a little harmony to 'em
Get a white dude that know about Pro Tools
One track, two track, let me hear it, that's cool
Wait! let me add something else to it
Bounce it down to two tracks, put it with the other raps
Thanks for your time, peace out you can leave now
Sit in the zone and zone out
?? in my mind I catch hell trying to come back
Shit shouldn't even have to be like that
But it is like that, that's why I act like that

[Hook]
That motherfucker crazy
That nigga done lost his mind
That boy unstable
And a danger to his label
They need to drop his ass
?????

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
You know the questions I had about, why folks got high
Pardon me for saying, no longer mine
I ain't ashamed of what I did, I admit to mine
Didn't hide it just didn't do it around nobody
You might a heard about it, motherfucker's running they mouth
High as hell they goddamn self, figure that out
Seen more bitch in these niggas, dry snitching
? what they called in prison
Death gonna have to deal with 'em
I ain't gotta be the one to get 'em
They already dead, look at how they living
One foot in the grave, the other on a 'nana peeling
One slip and that's it
I no longer deal with 'em, I stay to myself
If I ain't with Simon, I'm fucking or I'm restless
But that ain't how the world look at it
Even after I showed ya the fact
But y'all ain't trying to hear that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
They say "the wages of sin is death"
So evidently I ain't fucked up too bad yet
Cause I'm still here
Whom shall I fear
Broad and bare chested
?? is here
My daddy upstairs looking down watching a nigga
Anything go wrong out here, he gonna fix it
Already told me
There will be no burden, you can put on me, that I couldn't deal with
That's why I stay doing anything that you can think about
Turning motherfucker's houses upside down
I'm through with this rap shit, had it up to here
That's why I give it one more try

[Hook]
