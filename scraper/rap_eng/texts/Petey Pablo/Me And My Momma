[Intro]
You know I asked my Mother
If it was wrong for me to
Fall to my knee's and pray to God
And ask for forgiveness for somebody else
She got a forgiving heart
So she told me I wasn't wrong
So Dad
I ask for forgiveness for you

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Me and my Mom was close
But my Pops was a rolling stone
He taught me how to be like him
And ever since then I been gone
But the difference with me leaving home
I never left for long
Cause this where I belong
And I'm grateful for him leaving home
Cause if he hadn't a left
I probably wouldn't a been able to stand on my own

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I ain't get to see my Moms and Pops in love with each other
I only got to see em' fighting and fussing
I only got to hear em' yelling and cussing
I'm throwing temper tantrums
Pops getting up
Walking out the front door and then slam it
I ain't mad about it
Everything at home was straight
Can't miss the taste of something
If it's never been on your plate
Can't catch a sight of something
If it's just a glare in your face
Can't understand something
That you're mind tried to erase
I caught hell in my younger days
Football ages
When the other kids had Pop's to play with
Coming from the fishing hole
With just a fishing pole
I ain't catch no fish
Cause Poppa never taught me how to bait it
Look at me now , I made it
I'm straight
And I don't owe that nigga "nathing"
And I ain't mad at my people, man
I'm glad I had a chance
To get to know my Momma being Daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Cause I done been stuck up (stuck up)
Shot at (shot at)
Hit across the head with a baseball bat (damn)
Stabbed (stabbed)
Right here (right here)
Damn near smothered with a plastic bag
Kidnapped (kidnapped)
Held for ransom
My Cousin had the money
But he ain't handle it
Young as hell
And Street's had me (they had me)
Thanks to my no good Daddy
That dude knew that my Momma couldn't handle it (she couldn't handle it)
All the responsibility she had (she had)
But thanks to the Good Lord, I managed
And you know what's crazy
I ain't even mad at cha'
