[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Bag a weed, bag a coke
Bag a crack, bag a dope
Little nigga in the streets of Baltimore
Living like fuck tomorrow
Riding round in a brand new car, what I need a license for
People only need license when they get stopped by the law
And I ain't getting stopped by the law
Nigga I'm on a trip like fuck the law
Better beat me to the draw
I'm on, give the popo what the popo give my folks
What I think the motherfucker asked for
Leave me alone
Or motherfuckin' chase this car
Cause I ain't pulling over nothing, motherfucker
I ain't got no license and I gotta gun in da car

[Petey Pablo talking]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I went to the pin
I had to do a bid
Fourteen with a seven man
Y'all really don't understand
Back then I'm a little bitty man
But I gotta will to live
And I gotta motherfuckin' heart that's as big as a goddamn car head
Shook up a little, but I was never scared
Motherfucker I don't fear not na'
Man, women, or child
Dude I'm a live wire
When you get a chance, touch a live wire
You'll see what I'm talking about
But not just any wire
Climb up on top a the house
Stay grounded and grab that wire
Blow the bottom of your motherfucking boots out
All you gonna hear is a POW!
And your neighbor yelling, MAN DOWN!

[Petey Pablo talking]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Nigga's call me cold, heartless, ruthless, outta control
But you know what, man fuck them hoes
They like motherfucking deers in the road
And if I hit em' I'm gonna tear the whole front of the truck off
And he gonna call the law
And then I'm back in the system again
And he gonna get paid, get up and hit wind

[Petey Pablo talking]

Cause I ain't got no license and I gotta gun in da car
