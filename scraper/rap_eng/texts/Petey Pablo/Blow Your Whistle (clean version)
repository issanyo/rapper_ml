Release ya mind, body, and soul, and let yourself become a part of the
Flow, like the EX roll, and you can try your best to hold it back but you
Can't hold, and even if you had a cramp, pull these handcuffs on ya
Turn 'em loose, don't worry 'bout 'em , leave 'em alone, he the one
Gon' look like the button ho, whistle blowin', and the party still goin' on
And he all upset, mad, cause he too grown, I'm back, I'm ready to take
My back, oh and I hooked up with Cash Money, how in the hell did you
Do that, elementary my nigga, I just took this little thing here and blew
It (Ya Petey Pizzle whistle) Yeah
