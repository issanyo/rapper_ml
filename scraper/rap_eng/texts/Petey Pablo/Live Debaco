[Petey Pablo]
With it with it one mo' 'gin, Petey back in this bitch (HA!)
Wit-a wit-a wit-a new-new damn flow that's sick
Get ready to change it back, it's a new ball in the game now
New rules, ain't no out of bounds
Nigga nigga this shit's storm, them boys
Keep your, proper composure, your p-poise (y-yeah)
We don't want a forum, we just wanna show 'em
That-that we got somethin if we need to throw 'em
Maaaan, we the coolest that there is (nigga)
This here, this year, came with the papers and package, it did

Greasy grimy grid-itty, ain't no playin Pid-etey

So what'chu gon' do now we got you, got you lit up in the light?
And blunted up and high
You like it, like (your) nighty-night
(Full of) somethin-somethin (fun) and excitin
Really really one of one of them, a hot tamale
Pants fittin tight as a, pair of stockings (Lord)
Lookin round this p-party
Each and everybody crunk up and, rowdy-rowdy
'Bout to be a whole bunch of motherfuckers in this motherfucker tearin up
Nigga get much (nigga get what!) GET GET GET GET UP!

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
