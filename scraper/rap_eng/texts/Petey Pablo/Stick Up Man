[Hook: Petey Pablo]1x
Niggas greasy, niggas grimy
Catch you out there wearing them diamonds
Meet the stick up man
In the club think you flossing
Wearing chains and all them crosses
Meet the stick up man

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I'm standing outside, I'm waiting outside
As soon as y'all hit the door
I'm looking like a window washer
But instead of a squeegee I got a 44
How hard, is you really is then
Okay to press your luck
Give your cell phone to your homeboy
Cause your homeboy he gonna have to press the number
Call the ambulance, and the rescue squad
To come here and pick you up
Cause I tell you to give it up, and you don't give it up
Than damn sure will tie you up
I hope you wearing one of them little pretty shirts
Cause I'm gonna damn sure bloody it up
Front gonna have little itty bitty holes
But the back gonna be dirty as fuck

[Hook]1x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Don't tell me I ain't gotta job
Do you how hard it is, to stop a nigga body guard
And then go and get the motherfucker you was trying to get before he break and run
That's why I carry this Mosberg
When the bodyguard see that he ain't gonna run
I'm gonna tell you what you're man gonna get
????
I don't play when it come to money
Y'all spend it like the shit ain't nothing
In the club my Mo Mo, and that Crystal, and that Patron
I wanna spend some too
I wanna do what you do
I ain't got it and the only way I'm gonna get it, is I'm gonna take it from you

[Hook}1x

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Ball players first, then come the rappers
Then come the motherfuckers think they rappers
Then come the c-lo game, then craps
Then come the card house
Then come the Trap
Big money first, then clean up all the little paper
I can teach you everything about cake
How to get em', how to trip em', how to rip em'
How to stick that pistol in they motherfucking mouth
Make em' kiss em', make em' wish em'
Make em' piss or make em' shit
Or make em' sit on the motherfucking ground
Hit em' on the motherfucking head with the barrel
Don't even knock em' out, just scare em'
I can teach you how to rob a motherfucker
With a motherfucker standing on the side of the motherfucker
And the motherfucker standing beside a motherfucker
Don't even know who robbed this motherfucker

[Hook]1x
