[Intro]
Hey hey! Everybody come here, I need all y'all to come over here
Come here come here, yeah, I want you to do this, come on

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Blow ya whistle! Blow ya whistle!
Blow ya whistles for me y'all!
I said if you wanna bizzle then you can let a nizzle
To blow ya whistle from Petey Pizzle to come on anda...

[Verse 1]
I can do anything and everything with new flows
Then take this Manny track and tear the game a new asshole
Me and my do-rag half man, with two black hoes
How in the world could it do this, I be so damn cold
I got a rabbit foot in my pocket, uh huh
Come on I needed the other part of the rabbit
To fill up a pocket, I gotta major problem partna
So that means I don't need to be bothered for nada
Um, feel me dogga
My head hot, uh huh, and my body warm
Uh huh, my nose runnin, could you close the door, uh huh
Letting out all granted and goodies sweet G's and deviled eggs
Boiled tater to goat cheese
Y'all don't even remember me
I'm Petey - take ya shirt off Carolina from Greenborough
But what Petey needs to see this evening
You can keep your shirt on - we gon' use these

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I tell ya when I come runnin head down, but naw
But naw, y'all ain't hit me
So I guess I had to ahead hit ya with something that could grip yo attention
That make ya yell at ya kids from the kitchen
What put that whistle down! But Petey on tv
Damn it Petey, ya heard what I say
I just love it when I could take a track and have me some fun
Get footloose, and still can put the club on crunk
Make a girl butt bump (ba bum), make a party go crazy, (ba bum)
When the first two bumps come on (ba bum)
I'ma have some, I'm telling ya mayne
I'm the new spokesman for gas grills and propane
When I wrote this I had to wear shades
I had to wear rubber gloves to get this today
Manny Fresh's CD player wasn't even playin
Man we need a fire truck, where my whistle at baby

[Chorus]

(Hey, let me hold ya whistle) No
(Uh huh, please, I just wanna blow it) No
(Just a little bit)
Ain't ya proud of me now

[Verse 3]
Release ya mind, body, and soul
And let yourself become a part of the flow, like the EX roll
And you can try your best to hold it back but you can't hold
And even if you had a cramp, pull these handcuffs on ya
Turn 'em loose, don't worry 'bout 'em , leave 'em alone
He the one gon' look like the button ho
Whistle blowin', and the party still goin' on
And he all upset, mad, cause he too grown
I'm back, I'm ready to take my back
Oh and I hooked up with Cash Money
Now how in the hell did you do that?
Elementary my nigga, I just took this little thing here and blew it
(Ya Petey Pizzle whistle?) Yeahhhhh

[Chorus] - 3X

[Outro - Manny Fresh]
Oh, and there he go, fa sho', Petey Pab
Straight hustla, play child, uh Manny Fresh ya heard
Petey check it out baby cakes
Uh you can buy yo momma a house off of this one
You can get yo daddy that truck that he always wanted
You can get yo grandfatha that chromed out wheelchair
And you can just go ahead on and just, glide in the wind
Ya heard, ooh, I'm feelin myself
I wanna thank everybody for givin' me this opportunity to blow my whistle
Blow my whistle, blow my whistle
