It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
Scraping up change in an ashtray
Had a voice said
It's only a test of my faith
It was only..............

(Verse 1)

Damn
This song for dat nigga south
That I was tellin y'all bout
Y'all check dis nigga shit out
Remember the song i told you came on sound like
How he was at a point on his own
And the promblems seem to be takin a toll
That he been fightin for so long
Seemed like erthang he did went wrong
But he found the strength to keep on goin
And wrote  songs about it later on
You know that shit hit me home
Especially when he would talk about the money he owed
How he took the bills andhe  payed somethin on each one
Like he put sometin on his light bill
Somethin on his phone
He'll get a lil money
And he'd pay a lil mo
He ain't have a lot so he just payed what he could on it
And somehow he just managed to keep all this stuff goin
It won't nothin but the grace of the Lord
Cuz I remember
I was............

(Chorus)

It won't until i was dead broke and about to go crazy
Half a tank of gas, two cigerattes
Scraping up change in an ashtray
Had a voice said
It's only a test of my faith
It was only..............

(Verse 2)

So it seemed ertime he got himself off the ground
Somethin'd come and knock him right back down
Sometimes he wanted to just lay on out for the count
Fustrated and tired
But he got on up anyhow
And wit a smile I'm talkin bout
Make you ask yourself "How?"
And then Cuz just  broke it down for me he said....

(Singing and Pablo talkin in the background)
I ain't neva been dis happy in my life
Ain't got a dime more then i had
But everything seems alright
And they say he ain't know...
Havin the joy of a piece of mind
Is more than any problem i ever had at the time
And now I know and I'm so glad

It was only
A sign of the tide
It was only
Askin me why should i cry
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today
Only a test of my faith

(Pablo)

Man that boy can sing that song
Play this shit ermorning
Just ta get my lil day goin
You just don't know how this had touched my soul to find out i won't da only
One that been through somethin
Almost the exact same somethin
Was eatin me up
Knew what it was
Just could'nt put it in words
I ain't neva been the type to really talk to nobody
So all the problems that i had
I just kept em all inside
Y'all had enough of ya own
To worry bout
The lil situation i had goin on
But you know God won't let you suffer too long
I ain't even had da radio on
I was out on the porche
Den Boom
From the Heavens above
Just when I was at that point
When I was just about to mess up
Man Buda played this song fo me cuz and i just shook my head like
"uh uh uh"

(Chorus)
It was only
A sign of the tide
It was only
Askin me why should i cry
It was only
Singing be glad your alive today
Only a test of my faith
