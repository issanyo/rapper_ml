[Intro]

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
What ya' know about running up on a nigga spot
Blowing the doors off
What ya' know about laying a motherfucker down
Taking his clothes off
What ya' know about trying to get back
From taking a major loss
When the shit you lost ain't even you're shit, that's Shorty's dope
I'm talking about Feds on your ass like some Hound Dogs
Every thing you do, every move you make, eyes on you dog
What ya' know about snitching ass nigga's on that bullshit
What ya' know about really gonna kill his ass, you see that bitch
I'm talking about whenever, in front of that nigga wife and kids
That's how serious what it did is
Yeah it is
I'm off the chain wit' it
I ain't scared to admit it
Just spell my name right when you submit what ???
I'm a duck-a-motherfucker, got to love me
Done six when I should at least done thirty-three
I did a lot of things, helped a lot of helping hands
One thing I never did though, was help the fucking Man

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
It's the first of the month and you know how the first flow
Motherfucker banging on the window of your back door
Trying to get served cause you known to have that fire coke
Not today, cause today you fucked up and dead broke
All you got is candle wax and motherfucking Anbesol
Dude, I think I'm giving up too much of the game to em'
Man, I been struggling since Salt and Pepper still Pushing
And Herbert Love had his mind stuck in salt pussy
One of the illest to step two feet into it
It's two-thousand and whatever real rap music
I wish I knew Rick Ross and pay homage to him
I did two version on the ?
I love music
I ain't got shit to do
But what I been doing
That's what I'm known for doing
That's why I love to do it
The good finish last
I don't why, that's how they do it
But I'm gonna get mine one day
If not I'll keep doing it
