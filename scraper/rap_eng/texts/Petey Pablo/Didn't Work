[Hook: Petey Pablo]
When the word got out
And my family find out
And I seen my momma with her head down
Couldn't stand to see the pain I was causing
So I tried to turn my life around
Didn't work though

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
If I had a known then what I know now
Think I would a did the same thing anyhow
Probably did it quicker than I did it when I did it
Cause I'd a had a picture, not just a figure (get it)
I'd a seen the trick
???????
However many days it took, I'd a took that shit
Read every word that they wrote in that bitch
Probably wouldn't a signed the shit
Took my old connect up on a offer
That was offered when he
Seen a hundred twenty-fifth street New york
Wasn't even five minutes into my reminiscing
And damn, "hey, wad up mane"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Fucked up, hell of a combination
What was even more fucked up was my concentration
I been hanging on by the "G" in the "hang"
Goddamn, yeah that's a pitiful thing
Act like I got everything don't I
Shit man, if you only knew the half of it
They say that it's the darkest before the dawn
But damn dog, this time this dawn taking too damn long
I don't know how much farther I can go
I done smoked my last smoke
Knocked over my last ?
You know shit real bad when a man don't even wanna sign another man autograph

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
One of the realest nigga's ever put his head in a fitted
Betcha you'll get it now, I'm on this Jay-Z rhythm
Betcha you'll feel me now, I'm on some "fuck y'all niggas"
And your hero has become your villain
To my limit, just as cold as a uncooked TV dinner
Heart bitter like a unripe lemon
Be a fool to keep representing ungrateful ass niggas
Motherfucker's want me dead, we'll go on kill me
Can't do it can ya', you know why
Cause when the sun go down, and at the end of the day, I
Won't do the acciduntal
Everything I ever done and ever will do, will be actions of intention
