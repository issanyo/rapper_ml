[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Vest on
?? fresh, Holmes
Matching from the hat to the sock, oh yes y'all
Looking for the next Broad
I can take home, give her what she want
Show her what I'm made of
Come on, you think I'm rapping for the sake of just rapping
I'm trying to learn you something, Baby
Hate to throw you off
What I'm doing ain't against the law
If your old enough to by a beer from the Bar
If your old enough stop, take this couple a dollars
And buy a couple of bottles of Patron and a twelve pack of Corona, for me
Tell the waitress I'm gonna tip her when she get here
If she got a problem with it tell her look a here, for me
Every nigga in this corner got a pocket full of money
Ain't no bums in this corner, honey
Why you think all the eyes is on us
Like all the eyes is on us
I ain't never seen it this close

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I ain't never been a Ho
I ain't never been a Trick
I ain't never been a Rat
I ain't never been a Snitch
Why I tell it like it T.I. is
It T.I. is
It T.I. is

I ain't never been a Ho
I ain't never been a Bitch
I ain't never been a Rat
I ain't never been a Snitch
Why I tell it like it T.I. is
It T.I. is
It T.I. is

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I had things in my mouth since 1986
So Bitch, don't be acting like "let me see you grin"
I'm a long time Partner, not a Dick-Rider
Get your people right before you talk that shit
And I ain't dissing nobody
Cause I ain't gotta diss nobody
Niggas know who the fuck, to fuck with
You ain't never heard me spit like I'm spitting
But I'm spitting like I'm spitting because I'm sick of this shit
See I'll be seventy-five till a nigga come out of his mind
And bust a motherfucker head in this bitch
Like I ????????????
And Niggas been waiting on this
Never thought that I would have to do it
But now I gotta do it
Cause I'm looking at these Niggas getting pissed
Streets love Petey same way they love Jeezy
And I ain't never had Jigga on shit
I ain't dissing, listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Put your money on whoever you wanna put money on
But if I want it bad enough, bet you I bring it home
I ain't the baddest Nigga in the business
But I bet you, dog
You won't fight your dog for a while when he bite me, dog
I gotta hell of a lock jaw
Lock on any body part
And I don't give a fuck, I'm gonna scratch every time he turn
Now maybe you'll learn, ????
I been holding back out the respect for the children
Trying to be a role model, but it's just too hard
That's a parents job
I'm sorry, may go home to your Mama, Shawty
You gonna listen to the explicit lyrics anyway ain't ya homey
Oh come on, and tell the truth Shawty
I mean I know you is, cause I know I did when I was a kid
I ain't give a shit about what Mama and them said
They said a hard head make a soft ass
Had to learn mine so I guess they gotta learn theirs same way

[Hook]
