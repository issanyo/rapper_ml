[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
??????  like the airplane pilot is
Like the plane gonna pilot this
(and then party like a rock star) just like them
But I think I rock more like the ladies on a rocking chair
Like all I should rock is damn Roc-A-Wear
Matter fact Jay, send a box of Roc-A-Wear
Let me show em' how to rock-your-wear
Now I would start my own line but I'm out my damn mind
How you gonna cold shoulder, the coldest thing that ever be cold
When I'm cold like the niggas on a polar bear's ??
What I am was a place to live ????
Santa Claus at his house with the AC on

[Hook]
Y'all got me feeling like Britney Spears
Anybody know where Lindsay Lohan is
Let me toot a couple of lines
And take a couple of pills
Get drunk, jump behind the wheel

Y'all got me feeling like Britney Spears
Anybody know where Lindsay Lohan is
Maybe if I fucked up a little bit
Y'all motherfuckers out here
Love me a little more a little bit, Shorty

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Nah, I ain't been laying up in the Cut, getting dusty
I been in the trees having fun with the monkeys
Out in California politicking with them Honkies
Trying to get that motherfucking Will Smith money
I ain't flipped on my folk
To say it, it's atrocious
I been on the boat in the middle of the ocean
With a fishing pole throwed as far as I can throw it
Baby, this time I'm coming home with the groceries
Never have I been more focused
Never have I been more on point and solid like gold is
My bad, most of y'all boys sound ho
Probably don't know what solid gold is

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Man, enough is enough
I'm tired of folk trying me, Brah
What the hell is y'all trying me for
Like I won't come and find you bugs
And do you like some coffee beans and grind you up
And put you in a barber chair, line ya' up
Duct tape, electrical cord
Find your boss man and bind him up
Now what ya' waiting for, you waiting for my time to be up
Man, my time will never be up
Time to shut what we call the fuck up
And the next one to say that, Brah
Go ahead and have speed dial set up, to dial 911 (ambulance sirens)
Yeah, ya' hear that, Brah

[Hook]
