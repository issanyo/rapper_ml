[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I make moves
I make moves
I make moves
I make moves

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Started in the streets
Came from the Gutter
Little drug dealer making plenty of money
Started selling dime's
Then I moved up
Started pushing twenty's cause ten's just wasn't enough
Dabbled that a few years
Had a lot a fun
Switched up the game
Left the petty shit alone
Time to get this major paper that I really want
Took off my ?
Put on a suit and let's roll
Time to get it cracking somewhere I ain't known
Ninety-five North, maybe Baltimore
Got a bid
Did a 1985, 86, Michael Jackson back slid in the same shit again
Cause the city was a lot bigger
Made me a lot richer
Then I got "locked up"
And went to prison
Stayed in there a few years
And made my decision
When I get out I'm on a mission

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Music was my first high
Sung in the Church Choir
Before I could even speak, I learned how to harmonize
Watching the other guys
With passion in my eyes
Wondering how mine gonna sound
When mine come out
Then I opened my mouth, something spilled out
Then I looked around, I done drew a crowd
Everybody bobbing they head, baby I'm throwing down
Oh yeah, it's on now
The way I'm going now
No looking back for me I got up out my Ma's house
And a few cars just in case we wanna ball out
Cruise around the world till the gas run out
Hit the station automatic window never rolled down
We don't pump gas no more
Tell them to come out
Take this hundred dollar, fill it up if you don't mind
Right back on the road hitting cruise control
Heading right back to wherever I was going
