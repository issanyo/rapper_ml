(Intro)
One for the road
Check it
Kind of natural, yeah

[Verse 1]
Look at then and when you got caught up
Reminiscing 'bout the past
Driving by on easy street
Thinking 'bout that we'd be here to last a long while
And real talks, every night and then an argument
But all in all we both knew
If nothing else, our love was heaven sent

[Chorus]
Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on

[Verse 2]
My brother Petey would say
If you knew then like you know now
Would you get down the way you get down
Would you glorify, idolize
Find the time, mystify 'bout life
Oh, why can't we be kinder
Joy that's hard to find
Lord please give me a sign
To some of us here right now
Don't think you'd ride on this thin ice
Without going down
'Cause time is running out
And will you be able to reach solid ground
Can only sing the words
It's up to you to listen
Show you the path to the garden
You got to follow me in

[Chorus]
Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on
Life goes on

[Outro: Spoken]
Hey boo, here's to thanking you
For all that we've been through (Life goes on)
It taught me how to love myself and now
You, and you I give my blessing
And I hope and I thank God (yeah)
That's true for me and my boo
Oh, Lord (Life goes on)
