[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
First let me apologize to Jeezy
For jumping on a Jeezy track and I ain't talk to Jeezy
But my intentions were good
I'd a called dude number but ain't have it to do it
Dog, the track was so hood
The first time I heard it, knew I had to do it
And if I won't intend to do what I'm gonna do to it
Swear to God I never wouldn't a did nothing to it
Everybody looking for him, where the hell is Petey at
Petey on the griz-ind, same place I been at
North Carolina is where I live at
When I go out to Cali it's to visit
And even if I did leave, say I did that
It'll never change the color of the blood I bleed
Or for what I bleed for
Or for what I open up my eyes every morning, take a breath and breathe for
Martin Luther Petey, Carolina leader
Got the soul of a lion and the speed of a cheetah
Busy as a beaver, wing span of a eagle
Nigga sitting high like I smoked me some reefer
Peek-a-boo see ya', wouldn't wanna be ya'
Still my turn baby boy, take it easy
Free the Petey, I got my feet back in the stiz-urp
Back up out the diz-irt
Sip-sipping on siz-urp

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I'm a legend
Wassup, wassup
Uh huh, uh huh
Say what, say what
Hold up, wait a minute
I ain't trying to hear that shit
I ain't trying to hear that shit

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Fresh and ain't nothing fresher
I ain't fronting like I'm better
But, till they find something better
I'll forever be the glue that hold it all together
I love em' all, like I wrote em' all a love letter
Carolina, what'd I tell em'
Didn't I tell em'
Hell yeah, through all kind of weather
We gonna weather the storm together
I'm gonna hold em' down, whether they right or they wrong
Whether they short or they long
What they let us put together, let no man put us under
Through the rain, sleet, snow
Through the lightning and thunder
We gonna keep on bumping through, like we in some bumper cars
Nigga's swagger swinging like, children on the monkey bars
Man I'm in a swagger suit, sitting in a swagger car
I got so much swagger wit' this, I swear I need to knock it off
Nigga told me, it costs to be the boss
So I opened up the vault, and paid him what it cost

[Hook] 2x


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
If you believe in me, you'll have eternal life
I ain't God, nah
But I'm God like
Come into the light, make all this wrong right
Quit all this back and forth
Man, I don't wanna fight
I'm enjoying life, I could a died twice
I got a second chance, I'm trying to get it right
Meet a pretty girl, make her my pretty wife
And have some pretty kids by her, aight
I'm a legend
