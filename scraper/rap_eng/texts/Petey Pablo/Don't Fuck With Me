[Intro]

[Hook] 2x
I make yo' head bleed
Don't fuck with me
I come to your house in your hood ??
Don't fuck with me
I roll up on ya', ??????
I do what I say and say what I mean
Don't fuck with me

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I was sitting home one night when the lights went out
Getting higher than a motherfucker, wildin' out
Nothing much, just tooting on a gram of powder
Since y'all already know my problem, I'm working on it
Anyway, back to the subject
I ain't cut em' off cause I ain't paid him for it
Some lame sum a bitch put a hit out on me
And this was they way of approaching
But you know me, I was ready for em'
Guns are loaded
I just crouched down by the couch, low to the floor
Told my homeboys stay down, I'll handle it homey
This here ain't gonna take but a moment
They done tried it before
I seen a shadow at the window
I ain't bust though
Cause I'm a pro-fessional
I want em' all on this side of the door
So they can hit me with the self defense law

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
See I was sitting at Sonic eating my hotdog
Spilling chilli on my white tee, fucking it off
When these dude's rolled up in a rental car
Asked if I could spare a few dollars
Don't this look wrong
First of all, What is y'all driving for
And why would y'all try to insult me
Do you know who I am, answer probably
Look thirsty don't he
Trying to rob me
I'm a crazy nigga'
I'm going to make it easy for em'
I'm gonna see how bad they black ass want it
I get outta the car
Walked over with my shirt wide open
Look down, got two big pistols showing
Cause I'm by myself nigga, that don't mean that I'm lonely
I got thirty-six waiting to floor ya'
I don't know ya'
And I don't owe ya'
Your best bet, turn the car around and floor it
Before I blow the fucking roof up off it

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Cause I don't need a whole bunch to pump me up to make me will do it
I watch too much forensics stupid
And they teach you what to do and what not to do
See I know how to take gloves and touch my tools
And I know what to do with tools when I get through
See the truth is you ain't supposed to hold onto em'
You ain't supposed to throw em' nowhere somebody will look
You ain't supposed to throw em' away, Look
See that's the first mistake made by a dumb ass crook
See you wait for somebody that's close to ya' to go code blue
And then you take the tools to the funeral
Let everybody pay they dues
And you pay your dues
And stick the tools under the dude
That's your man he would do it for you
Take it to the grave for me homeboy
You know how we do

[Hook] 2x
