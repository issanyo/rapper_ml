Try this one!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1 - Bubba Sparxxx]
I come, they go, I run, they slow
Ain't ashamed that I did what I did
I just lived how I lived, your life say so
Ain't a single hole I can't roll
I'm platinum, they proud of they gold
Buckhead bouncin, moved a little ounces
Talkin out loud, but I didn't know
Waitin for the day that Bubba K blow
When you got a show though, bet you can't fold
Ask 2 Stoute, he know what I'm talkin 'bout
Motherfuckin bank account, they say o's
These hoes better stay on they toes
The deep play threat, I just may go
87 yards in the blink of an eye
It really don't matter what you think of the guy
Cause I'm eager to try this style and that style and stack piles
Of cash, While sayin somethin, dude's agile, hear that wow
A bad child that turned good, now I earn good, but I burn better
That kush, please just shush wuss, I'm the team captain, get your first letter (bitch!, pussy)

[Hook - Sleepy Brown] - w/ ad libs
Your thinkin your that boy, know where I cut boy
I'm on the otherside of the room
Your lady been frisky, tell her come get me
I'm on the otherside of the room
If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the otherside of the room
Whether you wit me, or you against me
I'm on the otherside of the room

[Verse 2 - Petey Pablo]
We never refused to carry them thangs (click, click)
Back in the days, hot as a flame
And I sent 'em through the blaze
All day for the pay, dollar bill from the 'caine
It's the Mr. Motherfucker wit a hundred different names
Ain't fuck with nobody (body), ain't want no problems
I've been, there but quite understand
A man that never talk hardly
Stayed to his self (cha cha), quiet as kept
With a coldness in his eyes, that'll scare you to death
I was on my way, man I had one foot in the grave
Motherfucker I stayed contemplatin about my last and final day
Wasn't supposed to be nothin
Niggas supposed to gave me life in prison
Last pick, misfit, partner did the full 20
Hey, I'm right here, heat it up, got the whole world shakin for me
Haha sayin (sayin)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby death and taxes ain't the only thing certain
To come unnerved from out from behind the closed curtain
Bubba skirtin, what's the word
You must of heard a lot of BS was asserted
Since none of us perfect, wonder who that was unnervin
Not me, not you, grin and bear it, got to
If they ain't worried about you, and they ain't worried about you
Here, here, get it clear, disappear from out my hemisphere
If indeed you got some business here, then state it crystal clear
All this fake innuendo from little minos
Gon' make the big O, fish up lower on the fish hole
Bub came to name baby, tell me that I did so
I'd rather watch my momma 'Get Low' then quit this fo sho (yo)

[Hook - 2X]
