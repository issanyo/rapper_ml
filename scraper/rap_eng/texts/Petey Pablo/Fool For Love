Today we will be discussing... Love

Is there anyone.. (I don't think you hear me though)
Is there anyone.. (I don't think you, I don't think you)..
Anyone...in love?

[Hook]
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you
Knowin' the shit you do
I shoulda known better than to be out here fuckin' with you
All that shit you took a nigga through
I told myself that everything would work out fine
(I fucked 'round and hit it)
Fucked around and slipped and hit that pussy one mo' time
(I fucked 'round and hit it)
And got caught up in something that's worse than drugs
I'm a motherfuckin' fool for love

And I'm just a (just a) just a (just a)
A motherfuckin' fool for love

[Verse One]
Man, I was sure I had Ms. Perfect
I was settling down
Through fuckin' round
Most the time I stayed at her house
Spent all my time, with her when we stayed in the town
Thought this shit right here was really bout to work out
Quickly found out, that wasn't her intentions
Shorty phone used to ring e're five seconds
Ain't pay attention
She would always take her calls in the kitchen
Go to the sink, runnin' water like she washin' dishes
Ain't tryin' a listen
I know how them shorties is
Always in somebody business
Gossipin', shootin' bullshit with her girlfriend
One day feelin like a joker
Told her I wasn't comin over
Jive got me on the last flight out to Arizona, what I told her
Went over unexpected
Rung the bell (ding dong!) Domino's (just a second!)
Opened the door with the robe on
She only put on, when she naked as the day she was born
I'm just standin' there with crossed arms
Then her baby car came out
Lookin' at me like ("Nigga wha's wrong?!")
Wha's wrong?!?

[Verse Two]
If I ain't just get outta prison
Man listen, I'd a did him
By Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the nigga, I ain't' bullshittin'
Glad I had my man with me
He fast, turned me around
Pulled me out the house
To the car, nigga we out
I'm madder than a muhfucker, heart tore up
Lookin for a clip to dry this off the side of (whoo!)
Man I caught him in the house wit' my girl
Damn cuz that shit was fucked up
Fuck her,.... just like the rest of 'em
I'm a tell ya somethin', I can't front
We been broke up for a couple of months
And I done called her up we talked
I ain't mad as I was
She ain't doin no mo' than I done
Ya know?, just got caught wit her's
Hit me right here when she told me she still had my stuff
(want me to bring it?) can you stay when you come?
(uh huh) DAMN!

[Verse Three]
Sheeeit, I ain't a sucker cuz
Shit, I can't help that I love her
My baby got some good stuff
I'm coo-coo for coco puffs
Time to break out the candles
And old Marvin Gaye
Huh, let me straighten up
Aw, you know what?
Hmmm, lemme call her back
Where I put her number at?
Ain't it 757-23..yeah, 36
See if she want some fish
I can fix it 'fore she get here
Man, I hope my boo ain't left yet
Aw, come on, come on
Know you on the other line an' shit
(Hi Derek!) Derek!?! what the..? (Pablo?) BITCH!!
