[Intro: Katt Williams]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Homeboy, I gotta lot of breath
You ever peep my ad-lib's
I be hollering on the song
? man like it's life or death
They got awards for video vixen bitches
Bouncing they ass and shaking titties
Make one for this here
Shorty, I don't ask for much
So when I ask for something, you need to give it up
Come here
Run it like a trick
?????????
"Fifty" said it best
When he said these industry niggas ain't nobody friend
They know how to pretend

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Ain't nothing pussy bout' me
I got credit and credentials in the streets
I got numbers I can call
If I need to make a call
Get ya' knocked off dog, real easy

Ain't nothing pussy bout' me
I got credit and credentials in the streets
I gotta Sprint Phone
And I gotta Verizon Wireless
And I got the Sidekick Three

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I wish I had that record so I could use the sample off it
But fuck it, I ain't got it
So I'll just do the shit myself
Nigga I'm a "Cannon"
Loose screw with attitude
Shy a couple loops from having all my Fruit Loop's
Missing a whole scoop
From having the normal two scoops
Oops, glasses is for you new dudes
I drink my liquor like a old coon
This my personal bottle
I don't share with ??
?? ain't really the word but I don't know what'cha call it
I don't know what ya' talking
Say what ya' wanna say
Mean what ya wanna mean
Wait a minute
How the hell you get behind these velvet ropes up in here anyway
I don't even know you're name
Standing in my motherfucking face
Talking about a couple drinks
(Don't do your fan like that there)

[Hook] 2x
