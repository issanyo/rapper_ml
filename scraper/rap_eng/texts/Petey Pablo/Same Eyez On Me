[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Did so much dirt in my lifetime
My lifetime
Lord ya' been hugging me a long time
Keeping your boy alive
At times, Lord folk's been done died
Father I
No, first Father why
Cause I've chosen to feel this light
I could never walk in the shoes of the dude 2Pac
All I can do is give it all I got
And all I got
Is a whole bunch a why I'm not
Why I ain't got
What I feel I should a got
When I first got what I got
When I got out and went up top
And signed my name on the left of the dot
Walked out feeling we ain't got no more problems, Ma
Cause your baby boy gotcha
And I did a lot a things to mama
Brought a lot a pain to mama
But, I was always honest
I'm a go get it and give her half of it
But she ain't want it
Cause she knew where it came from
But, some days I ain't even have spit to swallow
Thought I had to go and sell me some bottles
Not cocaine bottles
Pepsi Cola bottles
Back then they gave ya' ten cent for a bottle
And this old man had a backyard full of them bottles
But in my heart, I knew it was wrong

[Hook]
Y'all can't see me no way no how
From the bottom to the top
He's here now
To shut shit down
Y'all can't see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y'all can't see me no way no how
(Lord is my Shepard)
(Same eyez on me, Unh)
Y'all can't see me no way no how

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I know what had to be done
So do me a favor
And let thy will be done
And let me lone'
And let me zone while I'm zoning
If I don't know ya'
Don't wanna
Less folks I know
Less folks calling my number
Worrying me to death for money
It's always something
Rent, light bill, car notes or something
Motherfuckers always gonna be motherfuckers
I love em' though I suppose
But then again I don't
Fuck em'
If it ain't children or old folks
Then I don't owe folks
Cause I wasn't put here to support ya'
To have one a your grown ass
Must get grown ass
Who was there when Petey was broke
Don't get choked
And don't look surprised
Motherfucker it was only six years ago
