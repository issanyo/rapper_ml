[Intro: Kurupt talking]
Death Row nigga
What's happenin'
Petey Pablo
Bitch

[Hook: Petey Pablo & Kurupt]
Bitch, I bet I'll beat yo' ass (repeat 7x)

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I ain't never been punked
Ain't never got chumped
Always been out numbered and I ain't never got jumped
I ain't never had to run
I ain't scared nigga, Fuck it
If I tell ya' something
Best believe I can back it up
I ain't claiming that I'm badder than the others
Cause I know I can get got like the next motherfucker
But if it ever come
It's gonna have to keep coming
I ain't never been the type to sit back and take a ass whooping
My pride, I know won't let me do it
Motherfucker running round telling cuz what he done to me
I'm my own fucking bad influence
And I don't need a gang ?????
See I been real since my Momma came out the room
With my Daddy cum still fresh in her womb
No brainer
Ain't nothing gonna change it
Fuck what a motherfucker thinking

[Hook: Petey Pablo & Kurupt]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
They got me waiting in a room full of dogs Suge
When they ear's move I know what they gonna do
I got em' trained like I want em', yo
Four Rottweilers, never seen another man before (goddamn)
Yo they some motherfucking killer's
And I'm a motherfucking killer
So there's hell on your ass, nigga
I hope you thought about this real good
And if you haven't
Yo, before this happen Home's, if I was you I would
Take your life and jeopardize it
But I'm gonna tell ya'
Many enter
Only few live to tell about me
I done seen a lot of change in this lifestyle
And still the ? thing happen and it seem wild
It's not as simple as it seems to be
Cause one false move and your ass is a memory
Nigga's is fighting for they everything
Life is suppose to be a game
But I ain't never seen a nigga play

[Hook: Petey Pablo & Kurupt]


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Motherfuckers getting chains stole
Calling folks phone, could ya' please get it back for em'
What the fuck y'all doing
If you was gangsta' as you say ya' is
Get your own jewelry
Where the fuck is your security
If you ain't as real as you say ya' is
Ain't that how your suppose to do it
Sounds good in your music
But if it ain't the truth
These days, these dudes will make ya' prove it

[Hook: Petey Pablo & Kurupt]
