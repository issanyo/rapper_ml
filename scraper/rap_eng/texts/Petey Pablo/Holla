[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I got my top down
And that thing
Wind blowing across my bald head
And that thing
Looking like a million dollars
And that thing
And I'm single and available
For you to holla


[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Just left my hair in the Barber Shop
So I could hop in something with a half a top
Riding around pumping up the new 2Pac
???????
Girls on both sides of my car
Baby in a Navigator
Hundred Chrysler got a Hemi on it
Choices I had, when girls are so bad, goddamn
Yeah I'm so bad
Bad as this jam
Understand, like a dude that don't speak Spanish
???? (in Spanish)

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I got the best qualification to have
First I'm a real man
Secondly, I never been married
And I ain't got no kid
I'm so well off, sometimes
Girls get scared
Wondering if I'm real
Yeah I'm real
Give me your hand, feel
And I'm rich (did you say rich)
Yeah I said rich
And I don't mind sharing
Yeah I did the freak thing
Ran the street thing
Now I wanna raise me a family
Don't get me wrong Dog
It was fun while it lasted


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Baby if you're real or trill than (come on)
You already got kids, so (come on)
I just want a good woman that I can take home
Take her down South, show her to Mama
I know you're skeptical because I'm a Artist
And you hear all the crazy things they say about Artists
All I can do is let time speak for me
And if you're ready and you want it (come on)
