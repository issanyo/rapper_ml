[Intro]

Ah yeah
Ah yeah

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
It wasn't till
That man gave me 14 years
And I sat in that cell by myself
Scared to death
But wouldn't dare, to tell a man how I felt (yeah)
It took that man to give me 14 years
To see life for what it is for real
Y'all can hear me
And you can feel me

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
It ain't one reason why
I don't live my life all the way right
And behind closed doors
Sometimes at night I'll still get high
The demons I'm fighting inside myself keeps me stressed out
But it ain't my homeboys fault
Lord knows how hard I ride em'
I'm still getting used to letting folks in, to my inner side
There's still a caution wall involved, I try to stay behind it
I ain't got shit to hide
My whole life is in all these rhymes
Sometimes I'll jot it down
When I ain't got a booth around me
I took a walk outside the other day
When I was out in Miami
I ain't have no destination
All the steps I took was in faith
Ended up at a poolside
With a dude that set aside all his fame
And took the time to hear me out and all I had to say
That's why I respect Jay-Z
Cause the dude could've spit in my face
And shunned me off and had me walking off in a ??
I ain't never really been the type to ask for advice
Since I got in the game
But there was something about dude(and I,and I)
And I'm glad I asked him

[Hook]

No momma, no daddy
No friends, no family
Too weak to walk
My faith had to carry me
Back then
Too hard to imagine
Being lost in the madness
But I had to get passed it

[Hook]
