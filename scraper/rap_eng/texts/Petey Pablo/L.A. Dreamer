[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I had to see it for myself, Shorty
I don't take folk word for nothing, that's just how it is
I ain't never did, wasn't the type a kid
And ever since I was a little kid

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I had dreams of maybe living in (city of)
Three wheel motion on sixty-four's
? and ?, Impala's
Sitting just as low as the car will go

Out here in (city of)
Blue's and Red's and Mexicans
And you can say whatever you want about them
But I know them
And all the one's I met, shit, is cool as hell

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
See me riding through the streets in a Escalade
Hitting corners with the music playing
In a hood somewhere near you
You, yeah you too
Cause that's, what I do
Same thing that I been doing
Born, in the hood and I'm gonna keep going
See a lot of y'all scared of em' (and I don't know why)
Cause man, (mine) sure have been good to me
The Hood give back, what you give back
You give back to it, and you can come back to it
You hear that (please rewind that)
You give back to it, and you can come back to it
See I don't just give folk's regular Rap music
I like to give em' something extra (hear the background)
That's me back there doing the grooving
I'd rather do that, and that's a dream of mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
See, I like to hood hop
Unless you're hood hot
And I don't wanna be bothered, cause I don't hate Cops
But I don't like Cops
Always pulling me over
Cause my car got the hometown plates on it
Still gotta home in my hometown don't I
So eventually I gotta home don't I
So leave me alone, doggone it
You're working my nerves, making me nervous
Why I gotta gun in it, Sir
Same reason y'all carrying yours
To protect and serve, backup
Back em' up if they act up
You know how they act up
I'm a big Buck
But, I don't really see em' fighting too much no more
See, them the ways of the old days
See, I done been around a little while, I seen a few things
Done a lot of things
See, I'm a Country Boy born
There's a whole wide world ??

[Hook]
