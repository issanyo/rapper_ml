[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Suge gonna be off the road in a minute
Stick your finger in the ground nigga spin it
All you ding-dongs out there had your little pass
You gonna have to turn them in, in a minute

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Where your motherfucking hall pass
You better have a hall pass or you better haul ass
I ain't fucking playing
It used to be a game now the game is a wrap
You had plenty time to run lap, now it's time to fall back
Time to bring the streets back
You know where the streets at
Right here in my chest cav and hard abs
No mask, no slab
Goddamn, you done let the cat out the bag
More less, lost the cat off the Jag
And that shit welded on there
Well and on there
??????


[Hook] 2x


[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
I'm a motherfucking ??
Yeah I said it, and I know what I said ain't shock you
I'm liable to say anything
I'm off the chain
Been this way, since I was in the third grade
Ask anybody that was in the third grade with me
They tell ya' the same thing
That boy crazy
Yeah, I'm crazy, mentally unstable
I got papers, that's what they can tell ya'
That's why I can hook the jump and switch Labels
And nobody gonna say shit
Who gonna get in the way of these two maniacs
Ready to bust a nigga head, faster than you could flip a light switch
You didn't see this, did ya'
No ya' didn't
And that's why it's so goddamn good too


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Hey Suge, let's go holla at Nate Dogg
Nate, where Snoop Dogg
Snoop, where Dre, dog
Tell him I'm looking for him
Tell him I gotta track for Eminem to get on
I ain't bullshitting
Dude, I really want em'
Think could ya send them something
How bout' Young Buck
How bout' Game
And all them other motherfuckers
That's scared to come out here on the West Coast
Cause they think they gonna get something done to them


[Hook] 2x
