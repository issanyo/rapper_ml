From the land of the trill, where the vanity's real
And yo man'll be peeled or at least branded, God-damnit we ill

Keepin boppers in file, standin on top of the pile
And you'll get popped with a smile, this ain't bout shoppin and style
This bout syrup and candy paint, you see us choppin for miles
Out the black and the 'Lac, swingers clap and if they take yo' flax
You'll get smacked for your packs, paper stacks and you'll crack-back yo' back
Hold up, they got game to sell ya, from drugs to paraphenalia
Gun-hand'll never fail ya, ask Rollie B, he'll tell ya
