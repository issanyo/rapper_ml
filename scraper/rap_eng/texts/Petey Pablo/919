Oh it's on now! I put my whole STATE through the door
Ohhh Lord, how you let them do that folk?
Like I'm losin control, runnin motherfuckers off the road, one-double-O

The country had to come there, poppa I love home
And comin home, like I love my momma; pop the champagne partner
Fuck it, drink it straight out the bottle
Fuck work tomorrow, Carolina havin a party
Get drunk as you wanna, get what'll get you tight
Tonight is a nigga night, aight? Nigga get right
Now with all your might, holla like your best friend died
And his help number is 9-1-9, one time
