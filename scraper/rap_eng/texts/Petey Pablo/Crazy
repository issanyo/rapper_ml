[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Nah, I ain't been laying up in the Cut, getting dusty
I been in the trees having fun with the monkeys
Out in California politicking with the Honkies
Trying to get that motherfucking Will Smith money
I ain't flipped on my folk
To say it, it's atrocious
I been on the boat in the middle of the ocean
With a fishing pole throwed as far as I can throw it
Baby, this time I'm coming home with the groceries

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Chicken in a coup
Chicken in a coup
Chicken in a coup
????
Chicken in a coup
Chicken in a coup
Chicken in a coup
????
You crazy

I'm been crazy (repeated 8x)

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
????
Just left the Mall
????, Fifty percent off
Barber Shop closed
Don't worry I know ?
He give me a ? as sharp as a sword
Picky people pick Petey Pab cause I'm the people choice
Pushing it (I'm pushing it)
I'm pushing like I'm Ricky Ross
Stunting like my Mama cause I don't know my Pops
Carolina still the country dog and Petey the Boss
And I be

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wes Cyphers]
All I know is what they screaming when we step in the club
Carolina born but we in they neck of the woods
???
Through your hands up let me see ya' cutting that rug
???
I'm eating that bud
Really have me getting a buzz
Everybody in the place still moving around
Get crazy up in here
Plus y'all moving around

[Hook] 2x


[Outro]
