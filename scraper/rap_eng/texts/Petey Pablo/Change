[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Street runner
Bubble gum chewing little fucker
Stayed in a asshole full of trouble as a youngster
Sold dimes for fifteen, making a big five profit
My thing was in the balled up dolla', now holla
They say absence make the heart grow fonder
It only made me harder
The further I pulled away from my momma
Fuck my father, that dude had a whole lot a problems
And he relieve the stress by whooping on me, with no problem
Thirteenth birthday, stole my brother revolver
Since that day a homeboy little life has been altered
Good lord, my folks was church folks
Stayed at the alter
With my name on pieces of paper for prayer in the box
Will or will not, do me, is all I got
At the bottom of a soda pop, looking at the top
Had the streets hot
Me and Tim, Carolina parking lot
First video I never seen so many shirts up
Now what, time to see them curtains come up
Time the shut these motherfucker's up that's talking so much
Hate me for what
Cause I ain't got your man on my verse
He come from my hometown, but homey what is he worth
Did he put in this work
And pay dues like I did, Sir
So why he still battle rapping in the slums of the earth
Feet in the dirt
Smoking on blunts of the worst
When my folk call down home Georgia dirt
Before somebody get hurt
Please just try to make this here work
I ain't them other folks that come from here and flipped on they verse
I rep for that hurt
Carolina quenches my thirst
If I could pull it off, that's all I would say in my verse
Let me reverse
Send a shout out to my folks at the church
I'm never converting
A trapper but a christian first
I'm a rapper, but that's a gift and a curse
And I don't know which one I love more, dog
The gift or the curse

[Hook] 2x
When the big man turn over my hourglass
And all the sand in my glass pour out
I'll be able to stand straight
And face whatever fate I gotta face with my chest poked out
You can say whatever bout' me
Call me what you wanna call me
Fact will still remain
Can't change
Can't change
Can't change
