[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I'm gonna set the record straight today
Tell y'all everything
From my first to my last name
From my joy to a nigga pain
You'll hear the truth from me
So you don't have to second guess about Petey

I'm gonna set the record straight today
Tell y'all everything
From my first to my last name
From my joy to a nigga pain
You'll hear the truth from me
So you don't have to second guess about me

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
(Let's start with your name)
My name is Moses Barrett the third
Slash Petey Pablo
At least a hundred years old
Don't ask me how I know
North Carolina born
July twenty second
Went to prison for six years
For doing what I did
Coke and dope sniffing
Yeah, I kicked the habit
(Well have you tried it since you quit)
If I had that's my business
I don't fuck with nobody
Avoid conflict
But me having a record means I'm guilty already
Sold dope, sold coke
Went broke, sold soap
I fell off, and got back on
Robbed niggas at gun point
Broke in they home
Tied em' up, duct taped em'
Left em' on the floor
Whether or not they was dead or alive
I don't know
I don't go back to check on em'
When I leave I'm gone
Before you ask, I ain't doing this for fashion or show
I just thought y'all should know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Fifth and fourteenth street
Balling ????
Impressed by everything I seen
He taught me everything I knew bout giving dope ??
And all the while I'm being taught by a fucked up teacher
Couldn't believe it
A dude that close to me
That knew everything about me
Talked to the police
Had the nerve to tell me when I went to button at the seam
At least he didn't tell on me
Dude, I couldn't breath
I called this boy my brother
I vouched for this motherfucker
Fought folks, and went to war for him
Whether or not we had a car, I ain't care
I would walk for him
That's the type a dog I was for him
I guessed it worked out for the best for him to be locked up
Instead out here in these streets with the rest of us
Cause ya' know how dogs do
When one in the litters weak
He wind up being dog food

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Gone out the prison a good year
Fore' I got me a deal
In the bathroom with Black Rob, and Dave walked in
Life changing experience
I'll tell ya' my friend
Ain't really cut out for a few of em'
That had this chance
First of all they too scared
To walk across ?
Ain't nothing but some grass
Let's see what happens
Ain't but a few line pushers
That'll push it and smash
Drive the car all over the road, zigzag
I ain't one for boasting, cause I don't brag
I ain't ask to be who I'm is
I am what I am
I ain't go to Suge and ask dude to save my career
We just went out and had lobster and crab
Took it from there
On the water front, blowing Cuban smoke in the air
Taking pictures of little chicks, out there playing with camera's
I know you thinking, "nah, that ain't how it happened"
But that's how it happened
