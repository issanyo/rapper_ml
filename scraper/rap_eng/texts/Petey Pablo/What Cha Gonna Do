[Hook: Petey Pablo]
What cha gonna do if I give you this money
What cha gonna do if I give you this money
This money honey

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
You ever seen me run a touchdown
Not on the field, in the club and it's fourth down
Last call and the club about to turn out
And this nigga got the girl I wanna knock down
(ain't worried about it)
I done wrote my number down
Stuck it in her pocketbook
Cause she had it open when I walked by
How I did the mine
Nigga's be trying to hit my ho when I ain't around
Saw her go around
Got to come back around
And it's going around
It just coming around now
Lean back clown, play in the background
I'll show ya' how your supposed to get down
(start that)


[Hook]


[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
You ever danced with the devil by the pale moon light
Jumped on a flight, then flew around the whole world twice
Got a Gucci Bag from Japan, that you'll never see again
Cause they ain't made but one
Las Vegas spending thousand dollar chips
Whether not you win, shit
Cause the nigga that you with told you that you could do that
So do that
Ooh, that ring on your motherfucking finger so fat
And the way that car that you drive that so fast
It'll blow the fucking half your head
You wanna hot boy or you wanna keep on playing
You know I used to fuck with Baby and them
Keep playing


[Hook]


[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
Still hood, still hard, still Petey
Petey still freaking
Thought I told ya' last time
What ya' ain't believe me
You wanna feel it
Back your ass up on TV
You ain't a Freak-A-Leek
You a Geek-A-Leek
You wanna Geek-A-Pop
Give here a Geek-A-Piece
Please leave, let me enjoy the few drink
Before they holla two o'clock
And I have to throw away five G's
I know I spend it like it grow on trees
But it don't really fucking grow on trees
How'd you even get in VIP
Why you over here bothering me
There go another Rapper
Go holla at him


[Hook]
