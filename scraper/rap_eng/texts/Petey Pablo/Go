[Intro]

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Jumping Jehosaphat
My teeth and my chain match
I'm getting this cheese like I'm a mouse at a rat trap
I'm swinging a ball-bat (throw the ball), Contact
It's going across the fence, so you might wanna go on back
Where is the stash at, the stash is all crack
What I'm gonna do with that, Man I don't sell crack
No, I invent
Laboratory and snap rats, it's really intense
Look around at these men in blacks
Man I'm beyond back, I'm back and beyond that
I'm strapped with bomb shell, I'm looking like Iraq
I'm done with these ass-cracks, I ripped up the contract
Started my own shit (CMG)
Can you believe that

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Go, Go, Go
Come on
Go, Go, Go
Come on
Go, Go, Go
Come on
Nah, you come on (Nah, you come on)
Nah, you come on


[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
????
Show me the booth and get me some juice
(??????)
Bottle of booze, hundred proof
Thank you, I'm done wit' you
I'm foolish with Pro-Tools
(I learn it) from watching dude's
Like Jimmy in Timmy's school
(I rock and I roll too)
I even do old school
Google my name, put me up on all You-Tube
Tweet me at Twitter too, follow me, follow you
Miss me with bullshit, if not than I block you
My time is so valuable
Bitch, I'm making major moves
I'm running more shit now, done heard him and you
There's nothing I can't do, since the re-birth of Autotune
T-Pain, Wayne too, I use it I want to


[Hook] 2x

Bounce wit' me
One time if you wit', wit' me
Bounce wit' me
Let me see if you wit' me
Bounce wit' me
One time if you wit', wit' me
Bounce wit' me
Let me see if you wit' me

Show me some love (show me some love)
Show me some love (show me some love)
Show me some love (show me some love)
I need a hug (I need a hug)
Holla'
