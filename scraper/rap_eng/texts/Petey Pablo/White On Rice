[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
Give me some white on white's
And Slauson Swap Meet Pants
4x Pro Club for my back
And a baseball cap

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Why do people love Petey Pab
Petey Pab give can give the party people what they want
I can hit em' high
I can hit em' low
I can hit em' with a hit and put em' on the floor
Every time I roll, I'm hitting trip four's
So many trip four's, you wanting to check the dice don't ya'
Go head, go on
I don't know how to say it homey
I just do what I do
Somehow it work out for me
I ain't a preacher's son, but I can preach a sermon
All you gotta do is know the word
See I know how to take a curb, without swerving
I let the car do the work
What don't fit (don't fit)
Don't force it
Just relax and let it go
I don't rock the boat
Do me a favor
Back up, you're standing too close

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Stupid is as stupid does, Forest told Bubba
So if ya' love your bitch you better tell her that ya' love her
Keep your bitch off my dick cause I'm gonna fuck her
And if she bad enough I might fuck her with no rubber
Trying to put a baby in her stomach
I ain't got kids and I can afford one
Bank account, really sitting on something
And now I'm on the West Coast, I lost track of the number
This here the jam for the summer
Every time you walk in the club the shit bumping
You hear the bass pumping (bump,bump,bump,bump)
Little Drummer Boy (rrrrrrrrrrr pump,pump,pump,pumping)
Sick nigga
Set trip a bitch a go getter
Way from Carolina how I get out here
Way out here
Man, I have no idea
But I sure do love this here
