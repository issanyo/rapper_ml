[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
I'd rather pay for the pussy than
Trying to find the right line to say to ya'
I ain't got that much time to give it to ya'
You want this money or not
Let's do it

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I said I'm good for wild'n out
In the club throwing money round'
Bad chicks that wanna dance with they titties out
Doing tricks making their booty bounce
?? balls in the kitchen, boot em' out
Now make it touch the ground
Oh yeah, she blood raw
If that ain't the baddest bitch up in here, boy I swear to God
Get up Mama, turn around
Look how she do her mouth
I got damn lip gloss shining like some Armor All
Uh-oh, there she go twirling around on the poll
Slow down ho, ho
???
I gotta pay her for it
Come here honey, come here, come get this money
You deserve it
Here's a ten, here's a twenty, here's a .. fuck it take a hundred, oh

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
It ain't tricking if you got it Mama
I ain't got no money problems
I could spare a few dollars to help ya' make it through College
It take a whole lot to get this pistol here hard
Baby you bad, and you dancing your ass off
Plus I like to see what I'm paying for
But why take a chick home
Yeah I know you going, put your clothes on
I'm a heavy hitter, and I'm a big spender
And I'm really the man when it comes to these bitches
I done been to plenty
And I ain't the type to tell you my business
But you can go in the dressing room and check for yourself
All I got to do is look a ho in her eyes
I been around the world, many times

[Hook]

"How ya' like it Daddy"
T-shirt, no bra, no panties

"How ya' like it Daddy"
Any way your ass will throw the shit back to me

Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty
You picked the right night to be in here stripping
Now come on here and let's talk about paying your bills
