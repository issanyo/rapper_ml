[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
I bought her some tities
Said you bought her some tities
Yeah I bought her some tities
Why you buy her some tities
She said she wanted some tities
And I'm a man, goddamn
What's wrong with that
I'm saying, them tities

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
B's, C's, all the way up to double D's
It's cool with me
You ain't gotta be ashamed
You're just a little scared
You don't want me see the mark, up under you're arm
Oh baby, baby
Hell to the na
I'm gonna suck on them nipples regardless
Think about it, who paid to get them things altered
Okay then, come on

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Wasn't nothing really wrong with her
She just wanted em' to stand up
Like when she was young and them things use to perk
She said they started sagging some
Hell, I ain't never notice
But I ain't a woman
And women know, especially when they think they getting old
I'm kinda glad she got em'
Cause goddammit, they sure do look good on her

[Hook]

Said they titties look good
???? look good
??? titties look good
Lil' Kim, goddamn
She going to jail
But her tities look good
Don't they
Don't they

[Hook] 2x
