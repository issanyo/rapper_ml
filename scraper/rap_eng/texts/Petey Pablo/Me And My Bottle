[Intro: Petey Pablo talking]
First of all
I'm gonna start off by saying
I am not an alcoholic
I'm a drunk
See, alcoholics gotta go to those goddamn meetings

Every rock star there's a rock star
Or they pill poppers
Or they alcoholic anonymous
But if ya' ? mine and mine and mine alone
Maybe, maybe, ya' get were you're going

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
I had a older cousin
Called him Uncle Milton
Uncle Milton kept a milk jug of water in there
But I found out later on, that wasn't water in there
Yeah, Uncle Milton was a Moonshine running nigga
And I was just a kid so I didn't know the difference
I mean, I knew the water taste different when I used to sip it
And go to sleep so long they had to check to see if Petey breathing
One day they caught me sneaking
Cause my breath smell bad and my clothes are reeking
Cause I spilled it on my sleeve
Cause I thought I heard the keys in the door jingling
I got a ass beating
See today they call it child abuse
Back in them days it was so legal
And then they did a crazy thing to Petey
They took me in the kitchen
Sat me down and gave me a whole liter
Told me to drink it, made me drink it
Me, a whole liter
I took one big sip of that shit, Ooh

[Hook: Petey Pablo]
Me and my bottle (Me and my bottle)
Just me and my bottle (Just me and my bottle)
See everybody got problems
But folk's scared to talk about it (I ain't)
I love my bottle
Just me and my bottle
Me and my bottle
I love my bottle
A lot of people got problems
But they scared to talk about it (I ain't)
Don't be alarmed if you see me talking, to my bottle

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
Now I'm a teen
Doing these teen things
Going to a kick out school
I was pretty bad out here
Hanging with the wrong crowd
Drinking, wild out
? Thunderbird with grape kool-aid inside it
Folks knew about it
Fuck it, I ain't hiding
No more ass whoopings
Cause I ain't finnen' to wild out
I ain't really wild out, until Friday
Cause Friday, and that's when folks got they checks
And they checks was getting cashed
We was right there
To catch that, snatch that
After folks cashed they checks
Yeah, I know we shouldn't done that
I was a kid
And kid did, what kid did
I wasn't no different
Than other folks kids
I wasn't the only one that did it, shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I drive better after I been sipping
Use all my signals
Especially if the police sitting
I be cautious than a son a bitch
Seat belt clicking
Both hands on the steering wheel
So serious
No swerving, no hitting the curb
Don't wanna talk, my radio going in there
I'm sitting straight up like a nerd
Destination ????
This stop sign ever turn orange
I been sitting here for an hour and it still ain't turned
But I dare not run it cause it's ?
Ain't got but one more point and my license
And my license is going, going, gone
Sat there so long, I done sobered up some
And I'm feeling real dumb
Cause I realized what I'd done
Sitting at a sign and waiting for it to turn
So I take me a sip
And keep on going

[Hook]
