[Intro]

[Hook: Petey Pablo] 2x
That's why I carry
Osama Bin Laden
For just in case one of these ugly motherfuckers wanna act retarded

[Verse 1: Petey Pablo]
Twenty-two's, twenty-five's, thirty-eight and forty-five
Nigga I got em', and they all over the house
In the kitchen when I'm cooking, in the cabinet with the cookies
By the stool when I do get in the bed with the coochie (I got em')
By the popcorn when I'm in a movie
Wrong move, won't be screaming cause you watching a movie (I got em')
So when you step to me, know what you're doing
Cause I'm one way on the T.V. but the channel can turn, and I (got em')
Like a military minded fucka'
Been sent to Iraq ain't got no family or nothing
Killing motherfuckers because I'm
Dealing with the shit that I been dealing with since I was a youngin'
I'm a dead man walking
Only reason I ain't dead yet, cause ya' know the dead live longer
And all you motherfucking consequence, conscience, motherfucking nigga
Fuck conscience, bring it on

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 2: Petey Pablo]
You wanna talk and I ain't a talking nigga
Talk to your Mama
You want drama, nigga holla'
I can handle that for ya'
Sign here, ain't nothing, it just legally saying
You ain't gonna sue me when I bring the fucking pain to your ass
Blow the pockets off the back of your pants
When I hit ya', when I hit ya' with these bootleg Wal-Mart brand
And even though I ain't suppose to carry what I'm carrying on me
They gonna have to catch me
Put me somewhere they ain't got em', Shorty
Just as long as he got one and he packing
And the police can carry em', I'm gonna have something to match it
If it happen, it's gonna happen
What's gonna happen, gonna happen
If it do happen, bet you I'm gonna come out blasting
What I'm using is a bad example
And I apologize to anybody that was offended by the dialect
But, that's what I'm trying to tell em'
When you do step, you better have your shit together

[Hook] 2x

[Verse 3: Petey Pablo]
I'm gonna have to smack a nigga, clap a nigga
I don't care
Gun you down at the liquor ?, drink me a beer
I been busting motherfuckers since BB pellet's
Well BB's is one thing, but pellet's another
But a, take heed of what he trying to learn ya'
You can learn a whole lot from a dummy
You ain't seen the commercial
Where the hell you been, and what day in time you living in
The one I'm living in, we close to the end
Fuck a friend, what the fuck is a friend
The only friend I need is "me and my girlfriend"
That's the only friend, gonna be there to the end
Long as I keep a clip, you know she gonna keep spiting
And I don't even know why I call it girlfriend
Cause this ain't my girlfriend, ??????
Playing with me, you playing with power
And the power that I'm down with, ????

[Hook] 4x
