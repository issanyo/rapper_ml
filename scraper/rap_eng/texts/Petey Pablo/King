Prof - King (feat Petey Pablo)

Yo, You know what it is

[Prof:]

Ya, It’s the almighty un-fuck-with-able
Magnificence transcended into physical
I make it seem like there’s nothing that’s less difficult
This shit is so easy to me I’m almost miserable
Highly volatile supersonical audio
I’m childish and apparently unstoppable
I ain’t been fucked with yet
Young legend in the making you can touch that flesh
When I hit the stage I'm a rocket propelled grenade
Melt face, they'll be mopping the floor for days
Oh my goodness I’m a giant
Oh my goodness I’m gonna step over all of mankind

[Chorus x2]
All men bow down, down
All men bow down, down
I’m a mothafuckin king, a mothafucking king
A mothafucking king, a mothafucking king

A big bad wolf don’t run
Hold ground till the midnight sun
I’m’a be here forever

[Petey Pablo:]

It’s your man Petey Petey
CMGeezy
Yo prof, let’s handle these niggas, homey

King Kong gorilla
Just got out of prison
Temper still short as a used up pencil
Stay to myself and I mind my own business
I ain’t got no time to be fucking with no niggas
Bus load of big butt bitches with big titties
They love to get freaky with Petey with no hitches
No rubber, trouble, a bottle of penicillin
And shots of Ciroc that I’m washing it down with
I’m the illest when it come to this shit
Ask niggas
Then the ones that won’t tell ya got hate in their system
Remember that’s how I got caught with airport pistol
Cause I ain’t got no problem going all out with them

[x2]
A big bad wolf don’t run
Hold ground till the midnight sun
I’m’a be here forever

[Prof:]

Ladies and gentlemen bow down to the untouchable, huffable
Drug buzzed white huxtable
Cock highly suckable
Fuck with me get a knuckle full
It’s true dog, my clique run the south side
Beef steak rib-eye plus the cowhide
And I never mention names or the titles of 'em
Bet the prey will never see the tiger coming
I’m a zipped lipped Jameson mobster
I only roll with kings, every name on the roster
I’m hot enough to marry Steven Tyler’s only daughter
Hot enough to boil hell up out of holy water

Oh my goodness I’m a giant
Oh my goodness I’m gonna step over all of mankind

[Chorus x2]
All men bow down
All men bow down
I’m a mothafuckin king, a mothafucking king
A mothafucking king, a mothafucking king

Recognize the king

[x2]
A big bad wolf don’t run
Hold ground till the midnight sun
I’m’a be here forever

Man for real, It's too late now man
I'm already here I'm...
I'm like a staple

Hey, here, peep this though...
