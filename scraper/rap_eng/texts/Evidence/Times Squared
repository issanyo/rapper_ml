[Verse 1: Rakaa]

Let me explain it, it's always right now, ain't it?
Graphic like a picture's worth a thousand words painted
Is watching it pass by the pastime
Or push the fast lane until the flat line saint it
They say that it flies, but delicate to the touch
You can repel it with a fingertip brush
Plus the long way usually starts with trying to take shortcuts
Chasing it runs blindsided brace for the rush
Wipe your feet before you walk through the door
Watch your step when the bridges burning
Look at what these kids are learning
Cattle works the farm, what wages she burning?
Orbiting the axis, tables keep turning
The world keeps spinning, you're born running out of minutes
Shadow puppets on the sundial, polymath, outer limits
Da Vinci painted Renaissance Man, better live it
Better get it before later becomes never did it

[Hook]

We keep getting while the getting is good
No spare time for average [?]
We got to seize the time [?]
It's now or never

[Verse 2: Evidence]

Am I left behind or just the only to stay?
Once it's gone, it's impossible to find your way
You can have it all, but can't collect it at once
What you want, you used it worse and that's a curse on all fronts
More to these stunts than increasing the speed
Like the days teach much to what minutes didn't heed
Marathon, what the fuck is your lead, we ain't racing
That's you ahead of the BP, you're being too impatient
I check my placement before I board
Let the odds even up before we settle the score
The word is out, we got war on the memory thief
I heard the battle long life, but the ending is brief
Known for healing, known for killing
The same reason I know there's no ceiling
The future isn't certain but today is always near
So we tearing down these curtains when they try to interfere

[Hook]

[Outro]

Let me explain it, it's always right now, ain't it?
Man, let me try to explain this
Time passes by
You can have it all but not at once
Man, let me try to explain this
Time passes by
Better get it before later becomes never did it
