Another victory [2x]

[Evidence]
This is motion uppin' poetry
Bullet in the chamber, wait until they get a load of me
Dial in from the rotary, the other end's a ringtone
It's like I'm at twenty, running to the other end zone
Never had a pretty woman keep me in the friend zone
Tryna worry not what about any of my friends on
Return so much I'll probably parent till the sins gone
Weed under the button and the scent's strong
Phone still off-limits like a motherfucker slangin' Mary
Delivery on time, every time, deli-very
Good intentions but the honest vary
Tryna find this piece of mind and count it out as monetary
My thoughts are forming into sentences
No telling when this evolution sends it into exodus
I'm not just out for the reference
Understood, the getting is good
At least the present is

Another victory

[Alchemist]
Stash be underrated, your fundamentals basic
Run the matrix, no dispute, I'm undebated
Beat banging like it's blood related
Elegance is understated, orchestrations leave you sedated
Back fresh, recuperated, brothers in step, highly awaited
Long time coming, rhyme dumbing, pour something, Bacardi Lime
Rum inside a cup, stomach rubbing, opinions borderline jaded
Stretch out accounts, blackboard, sketch out the routes
Stop short, stepped out the house in Venice
Bare witness, words scripted, three dimension vivid, exceed the limits
Meanwhile I pencil in the digits, gangster white wall spinnin'
Levi denims and crushed linen, kangaroo coat with the custom stitching
Serve dishes, dirty soup kitchen, heavy hitter, I swing at whatever you pitching
Listen
