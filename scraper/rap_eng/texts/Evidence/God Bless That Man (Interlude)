{*phone rings two times*}

From out the fiery depths of a blazing inferno
Jumping out of live helicopters juggling hand grenades
With bullet necklaces
One man, and the sticky
Follow darkness clouds
Fusion drop a building
Comes a man, ready to save the nation
He ain't here, leave a message for him
He never calls back cause he's busy on the job, saving people
God bless that man, out
