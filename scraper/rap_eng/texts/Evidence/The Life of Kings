[Verse 1: Phonte]
Back with that new new to tell you where I come from
Sing a song so I could never be unsung
They think I'm on some, being fair weather
Its just my ensemble don't care whether
You shake your tail feathers, or your pom poms
Razor sharp nigga bong bong
Its a bad time to be a mc if you ain't rhyming right
I spit that China white nigga call it Hong Kong
Hit the city to see one of my school mates
Making six figures but she still got a roommate
Just to have a downtown apartment and some outfits
And you asking why I never leave the south, shit...

[Hook: Phonte]
Take some time to dream
Peace of mind is a delightful thing
This is the life of kings

[Bridge: Evidence & (Phonte)]
And we got it (Yessir)
I'm the King!

[Verse 2: Evidence]
People be confused how I move with the utmost
Respect and yet I get my due
And true, I got nothing to prove
Could be my new objective but let's not object to truth
(cough cough) on days like these
I count my blessings and say my dreams
Out loud when I wake up
The voice up inside of my head
Telling EV lets get on the day and out of this bed
Kiss my mother gave my daughter a pound
Then she hugged me (what) then she turned around
In my time the life of a king is undefinable
The closest we might get is pressed up to the vinyl though
Shit...

[Hook]

[Bridge: Evidence & Big K.R.I.T]
(Yea)
Tigallo, (Big K.R.I.T), E V
I'm the King!

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
Now some consider me a tyrant
Cause I would rather push chariots, dodging them sirens
Trunk beating like violence, searching for me a vibrant thing
More concerned with what books I read than what side I claim
Got a vision to be veteran
With a future brighter than a writer deciphering light by Thomas Edison
Cause you remind me of a derelict relishing on relishments
Too busy throwing rocks at my throne to find a chair to sit
I'm the type of king you'll probably see Coretta with
Country bred, country raised, and intelligent
Rosebud lifestyle and yours is petal-less
The hand of God and mine you shouldn't meddle with
My reign is benevolent
Ever since I fell out the womb I was destined to conquer melodies

[Hook]
