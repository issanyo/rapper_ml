[Intro]
Why do you have an umbrella
Because the weather man said you have to have one at all times
Because it's going to rain cats and dogs

[Verse 1]
One-liner flow
See it in my liner notes
The kind of ideas make it seem like the thoughts
Took three hundred and sixty five nights
I picture the high life
Poolside, made my own terms from lonely nights
Born the wrong ??
They say old soul with kid's energy
Still draw from my torso for enemies
By any means, I've seen what it's worth
A curse, snakes and centipedes, venomous
Seems the only safe place is Venice Beach
I try to wrong my rights
I try to right my wrongs
I try to write my songs
Shine lights but the night is gone
Daybreak becomes the encore
Can't tell the day to stay because I'm on tour
A young kid pumping De La Soul
I spit live
You could say loco
Sixteen not a day, no flow
I grew up with nervous skaters
Some headed for greatness
Others served as waiters
Some nameless
Others were stars and straps ain't famous
Steel that ain't stainless
Hi haters, peace signs, see ya later
Lying for no reason, quit trying it's greasy
Easy target, walked up in Florida gators
Origin lost angels, support Lakers
Four finger discounts, just announce my fortress
Fortress of my get down, live from Belgium stages
LA made him, LA grazed him then LA saved him
It's back to the beach bitch where Miss Taylor raised him
My Momma opposite of Sarah Palin
With no gat from Russia looking back like, quit playing
Ev is here, staying

[Outro]
I do believe the idiom raining cats and dogs
Stems from the Norse mythology
Cats were believed to represent the wind
And dogs represented rain
Different animals represented different weather
And natural phenomenon
