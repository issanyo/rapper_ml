[Verse 1: Evidence]
First up in flight like I studied Raleigh
Same sky that I'm flying that got Buddy Holly
Back from tour with the Brother Ali
On my fellowship shit
Pumping "5 O'Clock Follies"
I don't say something
I got something to say
Sometimes I'm colorful
Sometimes I'm gray
We get cancer twenty times a day
We're just strong enough to brush it off
And kneel when we pray
The truth reveal what it may
Tumbling dice, Dice Raw, Dice Clay
Bad cards are nothing nice to play
California nights a gamble but I stay
They say home is where you hang your hat
Well I ain't hanging up that
There's no time to relax
Only time to react
It's Dilated for life
I'd like to welcome us back
Directors

[Hook: DJ Babu]
I am the director as far as you are concerned

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
First to light up the crumbled collie
I could ride skateboards but I could never ollie
Forced to war like Muhammad Ali
Shape the future like cash is clay
Melt time
The Salvador Dalí
The world spins through my lens
I'm focused now
Thoughts wandering through my sins
Fish-eye, birds-eye
Viewfinder third eye
High-definition, high-resolution words fly
Riots for celebrating the game
Then live via satellite Laker parades
Danger in the pit
Are they dancing? Are they fighting?
I block off the angles then adjust lighting
Don’t believe I touch thunder and lightning
Until they see the miracles pictures, then I’m frightening
We just capture the facts
Dilated never left
I’d like to welcome us back
Directors

[Chorus]
