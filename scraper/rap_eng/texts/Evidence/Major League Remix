[Defari]
Dangerous up in here --Don't front--
So many claim the fame, but never see the day
When lyrically they could get some run, in the Single-A
This here's the major leagues, where big hits are guaranteed
The Ken Griffey turbo 850, professional MC
One more time that cat Defari
With a sting operation so blatant I call it B.I
Illegal use, mic abuse, man-size enterprise
It's time to shoot straight, elevate, and make the world realize
That mics get ripped, and spots get blown
I strive to be a Golden State All-Time Great, like J-Ro
I gets burned when the Technics turn on mix shows and mix tapes
That you hear when a car turns, left on the street
You know that shit that make you bounce
Nuff respect to Rasco and Evidence
Y'all hold it down on the mound
I'm not like Hideo, don't got it Nomo
I'm more like Randy Johnson, heat, heat, heat! for sure

Chorus: Defari
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
You rookie level, you ready for combat?
"If you step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
Evidence throws K's and lays tracks
"...step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit

[Evidence]
I throw spit-fingers and sliders, and hit batters with attitude
The signal's in, my catcher: Defari Herut
I got to risin on the mound, target and pin-point
Retire the side, put on a jacket, ice my joints
And body parts, world-wide, Evidence, I'm known
Have you fallin out the batter's box when curves are thrown
Precise angles, disect the strategy, no cost
And just cause I choose to wander don't mean I'm lost
I got the button-up jersrey, Dilated written in cursive
Spill my heart to wax to put the NOC List* in the open
Three men against nine players, yo, that shit's unheard of
Plus my eyes are open in takin focus and scopin
Yo, One cat got on base but he didn't learn his lesson
I faked to first, then picked him off at second
Patience is a virtue, yo he couldn't understand
(What's that?) That cat's out, _Time Waits For No Man_
Bust it

Chorus: Defari
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
You in the batter's box, you ready for combat?
"If you step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
You lookin ready, you ready to swing your bat?
"...step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit

[Rasco]
Yo, now we blaze mics like thug niggas roll dice
When crossin my bridge you've got to pay the toll twice
Be raisin the price, it be way out of the range
Was lookin for curves, I had to threw the circle change
I'm pound for pound the best man on the mile
Your rugged terrain is like sand on the ground
My beef shakes, I'm throwin gas at the plate
So show me some love and meet with Ras at the Gate
So never dispute the cause, bench-clearin brawls
You doin the shit that niggas did last fall
I'm catchin the signs, and y'all, catchin our rhymes
Its outta the park and down the third base line
So cover the base, my whole team ready to face
Defari, Ras' and Ev tearin up the place
I only got taste for those, major micros
We bigger than life and y'all tiny micros
Only expect we still waitin on deck
But fuck with mine you'll find seems on the neck
]From heat that I'm throwin this ?treat from 12 beat?
Said you had fans but couldn't fill the seats
Now most get intrigued from watchin the arm speed
So call when you ready to leave the farm league
Sport the pinstripes, break throug like Jackie Rob'
You Mark Port-u-gal, I'm swingin like Ty Cobb

Chorus: Defari
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
You rookie level, you ready for combat?
"If you step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit
--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
You in the batter's box, ready to swing your bat?
"...step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit

--Don't front-- This where them big hits are guaranteed
This ain't no minor league affair this here the major leagues
Rasco keep it phat and thats that
"If you step up to the plate, better bring it back" ---] Xzibit
