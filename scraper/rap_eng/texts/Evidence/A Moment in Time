[Evidence:]
As a kid ma hit me with the truth
Let me know Santa clause was never on my roof
When I lost a tooth, it never went under the pillow
I gave it to my parents' right there, they hit me with dough
Later on I was the all-star pitcher
7th grade my girl hit me off, the World's different now
Got to wicked curve ball now
Plus Confidence, that's 3 strikes you're out
Junior high had all the Chicks was on top then
Got to high school shit wasn't poppin'
Small fish big pond, kinda got lost in
This new matrix started smoking weed often
I missed the whole 9th grade ditching class, getting no ass
Tryin to get back to the past
The only thing I did do was make this music
Home Friday nights at the time was confusin
Things changed things I started to notice
The more work I put in, the more people focus
Was like "oh shit, this my ticket"
Enemies before, now tryin to kick it
Pulled out my slump, imagine that
Two years I got my swagger back
In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make
Just a matter of time, that's a fact
On my mom's porch looking at the stars, tellin Joey Chav that's what we are
There we go, my soul, they'll never owe me
My crew rolled, the top, it won't be lonely

[Planet Asia:]
88, Malcolm x books, Public Enemy
Rockin plain gear, same year lost my virginity
Packin gats we was that active
Middle school 7th grade pill bottles of crack in my jacket
89 got on some? shit
? Full of Truth shit
Hangin with the 8th grade n**** that chew shit
Back then we was still in cars
Give a damn if we knew you
Outside the neighbourhood?
9th grade twisted up high school better looking
Known as an mc
And I'm getting steady pussy
Don't hate the game, hate this player
Since the 6th grade I've been friends with Shake tha Mayor
Met Rasco in 1990 still grimy
Kicked out of school in 10th
But still graduated in 95'n
Remember me the kid who used to ditch school religiously
Who used to break-dance and centipede
12 years later and I'm still the same
This time I'm even more on top of the game
Here we go, my soul, they'll never owe me
My crew rolled, the top, it won't be lonely

(The time is now, the moment that you waited for)

(It's time to move on I'm going for mine)
(I'm living for the day; this is my moment in time)
