First off
Fuck a critical opinion
In the kitchen sniffing ritalin
Prxphet is up on this shit again
Tell the bitches to sit and
Quit with fidgetin
The literally scenic
Triple vision to the bitter end
The kid so stuck in his ways
Puffin the haze
Out of town so I got nothing to waste
Except a couple haters get to duckin the face
And you beggin In the street like a cup full of change
Check the repertoire show you where the weapons are
Hit the blunt now I’m higher then I set the bar
Some high aggression is as passive as the seconds are
Imitating extraterrestrials  I was sent from mars
I am mental benefits better yet my headset
On taking all the bread like I don’t got no table   etiquette
I’m off the handle flippin samples off the bank a set
Intellect ain’t shit you see the aura   around my silhouette
Elevate my spirt with my LSP conspirators
Counting all my miracle lyrics I spit hysterical
Every beat I tear into seminarian embarrass you with the parables
