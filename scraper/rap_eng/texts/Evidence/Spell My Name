[Defari]
I - fell from the sun with a fire tongue
Burned a thousand beats, now I'm wanted for fifty tons -
Of RAW, pure, uncut dope
My rhymes are Columbian coke, lethal choke
I - shake up the streets, the earthquake
3-1-0 King, yeah that nigga ill with wordplay
NOW - straight to the top
Grind, double flip, stack chip... stay away from the cops
WHY? - they hate us, they're the worst of devils
The Romans hated Jesus like the police treat us
GAME - that's all that I got to give
A lot of artists don't deserve a full right scholarship
To this GAME, a lot can be figured out
I think to myself why you drink whiskey and Guiness stout
Who's to BLAME? - it's the cowboy in me mane
Joy and pain, make sure you get it right, spell my name

[Hook]
I am the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-
Come on and rock with the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-A-R-

[Defari]
I - came in the game, flossed the royal name
Dropped +Focused Daily+ now I'm wanted for more of the same
PURE, raw, supreme level flows
Twenty-four carrot gold, look and behold
I - beat the Los Angeles streets for heat
Travel fifty states, burn crowds like cooked meat
FIRE - explosive material
I shot you in the ear, but you don't hear me though
Now your MINE - I walk with the best of them
Talk with the best of them, fuck all the rest of them
Take your TIME - young man with big plans, we advance
Put the cash in my hand man, I ain't fuckin' playin'
NOW - how you like me chump?
Come through your town and I'll fuck shit up
Now the cars all POUND - cause my CD bump
In the streets like, "Yeah, that nigga Herut rough"
Spell my name

[Hook]
I am the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-
Come on and rock with the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-A-R-

[Defari]
I - shook up the world, parted the sea
Always felt like Muhammed Ali
Proud and BLACK
Red and green, the flag of a nation of millions
They can't hold us back, oh it's like that?
Pace the room like a Five-Star General
Holdin' on to that weak shit, man let it go
NOW - I've been sent to ease all your misery
It's official, I'mma lead you through the new century
WOW! - Wow is right
You're in safe hands with ?Alstate? when I grab the mic
Break WIDE - lose all sight
The pit's goin' crazy, it's bananas tonight
They must want MY - public opinion
Attention, attention, all those who's listening
The man gets DOWN -
Hold your position, dump ammunition
Again I must mention, spell my name

[Hook]
I am the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-
Come on and rock with the D-E-F-A-R-
I am the D-E-F-A-R-I
