[Hook]
"Let's get it together, no matter the weather"
"Rain or shine, yes in any weather"

[Verse 1]
(And another one) Yeah..
Uh, it's the joy and the pain
The rain and the sun, namin no names, came in the same
Never aimin my gun, you get one shot
Never waving my chance, maybe waving my chain
My b-boy stance is authentic
Mos def, universal magnetic
Fat beats on Vermont, I set it off
Uh, from the basement floor
Bob Dylan heard it knocking on Heaven's door
From across the room to when I'm out on tour
Reminds me of a time when my life was pure
It finds me at the oddest moments
Tried to focus but end up zoning
I go back, but the caption's closing
So cold, but the clock ain't frozen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It was something, December babies
As Christmas came, we had our birthdays lumped in
Layaway, one present, two holidays
Seen it from a mile away, you can't lie to your kids
I guess that makes up for no bros and sisters
Nothing's ever missing in the kitchen
Nothing, ever really went wrong
Until the one that raised me was the one that's gone
It's funny how strength comes in different forms
Some embrace they faith, others weather storms
Others tell themself that the pain moves on
I saw the clouds move in and when it did, they poured
I push away the pain, it's the sun and the rain
Rain or shine, I got my umbrella
I said it's none better, I'mma see you a-gain
It's worth to listen to woman's worth, it's worth everything

[Hook]

[Outro]
"So much to say, but I still flow slow"
