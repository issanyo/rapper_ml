[Verse 1]
Yo
Abominable snowman
Fuck with me that’s comical
Structure come together glued by strong bionic molecules
I spit hellfire, and breathe tragedy
Human flamethrower
A dragon full of agony
Imagination vast
Vocabulary fierce
Travel through the years and cry imaginary tears
Aye
Neurotic noddy sleepwalker
I spit a blizzard, kid, it’s colder than a meat locker
Over thirty, still dirty
Kids are full of bird shit
I blurt assertively to murder nerdy wordsmiths
Bax War, tier three
Hard cock Aryan, pit bull terrier, barred barbarian
Still making magic like I’m Harry Potter
Not very modest
White like a dairy product
I’m a scary little monster carrying an axe
I will bury you, I’m bonkers
Warrior that conquers
Chomping at the pit
Dawg, I’m confident as fuck
So I’m stomping them to bits
Little Rocky, cocky legend with the evil voice
Fear the reaper, I go deeper, I’m the people’s choice

[Verse 2]
Every verse venomous with puncturing fangs
Whole life functioning with the dysfunctional brain
Heart is pumping nitroglycerin through my veins
Still explosive, I’m ferocious but emotionally drained
Dreaded fist of the northwest
Little devil I’m a foreign threat
Thick lines of strychnine
Got a following of sick minds
Madchild’s a gladiator
Strong jaws, I’m a salivating alligator
Swamp creature with strong features
Don’t breach, you don’t know how long my arm reaches
Still compatible with bad apples
I’m a savage when I’m battling a track wacko
Razor sharp, slice your jugular veins
Blood stains like you dropped a fucking bucket of paint
