[Hook]
You cheated (Did you hear that?)
And you lied
Hear what the promise is
Oh no, no
How could you do that
You would never do that

[Verse 1]
(It’s not what it was, but it is what it is...)
I’m, bugging with flashbacks
Struggling past that
Trying to make sense of the abstract
Heart skipped like Picasso painted it strange
A mix of beautiful pleasures and hideous pain
Fools rush in, they say love’s an idiot’s game
I never play dumb, I played hard to win it the same
Me and my lady like, Lee and Lady Pink in the Eighties
Never a toy, but baby doll managed to play me
Should (I)?: Try to find truth in the lies
Or accept I’ll never know and make moves in disguise
And grin, a special void filling it in
But that’s physical will never have the feeling again

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Trusted her, but the cameras had opposing spotlights
Like the headlights, dear: she was frozen
Shoulda checked the time like watch shopping on Bundesstrasse
Thought I won, shoulda cut that loss
Flashing my trophy, but I was the prize on display
I heard the giggles and the whispers, all eyes were this way
Gorgeous, but damn near humiliated the god
Swear to God, I felt physical pain in my heart
Putting pictures on tracks like graffiti art trains
Living in a shark tank, ‘Eight-Oh-Eight’, heartbreak
Let the right one in, trying to tell apart fake
Hit the vampire light, never with a heart stake
Should (I)?: Forgive and just move on in healing
Or do it like we do it, make the pretty toes touch the ceiling
And grin, revenge, lust, feeling the sin
But that’s exercise, will never have the feeling again

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Saw it all, like a fly on the wall
To not question situations not my style at all
Why does nightfall but not break
Day break, but not fall
There are flagrant fouls, even when fouls are not called
But, whistle’s blown, the flags are thrown finally
Penalized for lies, unleash the truth violently
Through the sky, aerodynamic like arrows, fly
Through the drama, through my armor, through my pride
My id, my ego, my superego
Be a week for her, talkin' ‘Power to the People’
But flawed, good Lord, she deserves an award
Delilah, but the cost is more than I can afford
Should (I)?: Pour a toast to my own ‘corazon’
Or a little for hers, injured in the war zone
And grin, thinking back to how our buildings would blend
But that’s history, will never have the feeling again
