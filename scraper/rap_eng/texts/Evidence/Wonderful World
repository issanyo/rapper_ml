[Verse 1: Evidence]
Never caught a fear in a fist fight, got a couple accolades
That is not one of them, blacking out to Budgie
On the kick drum however is, made some notables
Worth remembering, dilated emblems
If the wind blows you'll find me floating
Everything's slow motion when I'm smoking
The smell is potent, life is vibrant, still shining, everything timing
I'll be at the shore, no vacation
On a tour saying color combination
I met some people, we started talking
They said stop, youse a dead man walking
It's not a clich√©, but this is take one
Make it great, it don't matter if you take long
I don't take shorts, I don't steal shirts
I only got good, I don't deal dirt
I'm a simple man, not a simpleton
Features of a God I'm resembling
Think fast, talk slow, when it's check out I'll see you at the cross roads
Think fast, talk slow, when it's check out I'll see you at the cross roads
Think fast, talk slow

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
Mary Holmes drop kick off the limo
Full coverage box checked on the rental
Left on ten, truck left hella full of cans rattling
Advertisers taking up prime space we're battling
Street on tour is a trust fund traffic
They love to feel the edge they heard the history's graphic
All of a sudden it's gentrifyingbeards, ironic tattoos, classic architecture, iconic statues
Glass ceiling, use the custom model, peek-a-boo
Sending lefts and rights through, taking you to flight school
Chief corner stone, cap stone view
Illuminating manuscripts to rap's glow too
Crazy felt life, Gracie felt stripes
Low key stealth trying to keep my health right
Bullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate
It's a new day, the sun shine and illuminate
Bullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate
It's a new day, the sun shine and illuminate
Bullet and proof closer, fake news moving hate
