[Refrain]
Here to save the day and steal the game
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
I know names who're moving the same
We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot

[Verse 1]
My quiet thoughts at night can turn rowdy
Light bulbs and bright ideas can turn cloudy
Big dreams even if they doubt them
I never wasn't sure if I wasn't sure about them
This is not your thing, this is ours
Gangsters got this thing about flowers
Rappers got this thing about power
Bitter and sour, gossip at the top of every hour
Walking in the rain off the Jim Beam
Dreams broken on the boulevard, Jim Dean
Get a grip for bars like a gym beam
Eyes redder than the rastas on the swim team

[Scratches]
(For you)
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)
(For you)
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)

[Verse 2]
I ain't thinking about BET
I'm talking about debt, 'D' to add the 'E-B-T'
91, Dub C, don’t work, you don’t eat
Crossed streets where reality and hard times meet
Back in my youth I was a wildcat
Put my tires in reverse and get some miles back
It's been a minute since a while back
Round of applause, blow the horns like Miles back
It's God's work, that is not in my hands
But I'm holding on tight for a few of my fans
It's dedicated if the line is short
And if the line goes long, that was your support
There was a few times I wanted your respect
But you tried to play me like some kind of a threat
The time done been elusive, ain't a lack of love
Just an alley cat, got a lack of trust
I went from slow flow to never the same flow
Cause doing part two's not the reason I came for
Until then I at the end of the rainbow
But still the pot of gold about as real as the game shows

[Refrain]
Here to save the day and steal the game
It ain't a crime if you don't get caught
I know names who're moving the same
We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot

[Scratches]
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)

[Verse 3]
Trooper, just below forty with the wind chill
All my shorties getting spin like the windmills
Weatherman, I’ve been hailed the sky curse
Fire verses I write for what the prize worth
Pot love, won, then I got stuck
Fell, then I got up
Never went back down, never played the background
Anxious more than patient, I attack now
Don't get my way is when I act out
Never waiting on the industry
Waiting on the tables 'til the tables turning into me
Go back, hands on the clock, you call it throwback
But only no dope and judge not if I know that
Need is need, that ain't weak shit
But greed is greed, that's some weak shit
I make a promise I'ma keep it (one-two)
Never take my kindness for a weakness

[Scratches]
(For you)
(We get away with a lot)
(We get away with a lot)
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)
(We're staying out the way, we get away with a lot)

He's very concerned with how much rainfall, and of course, snowfall is going to be seen from many locations extending from California and beyond
