City slicker, what's the definition
Cavi waves, fresh fades, spank kicks and
Spank shirt man listen
The type of ladies out here be so pretty you wanna kiss em
Hot ???? and dismiss em
Jump in the Q
Start the ignition
Evidence (Evidence) got another sound mission
I'm shittin
Defari's right here in the flesh, let's start spittin
Shine and glisten
Norm Nixon
One nine seventy-nine lay it on the line
I'm the sunshine
I feel the same as all those who say 'fuck the one-time'
I break bread, some folks think that we knuckleheads
I chuckle, say 'fuck you'
Bubble, and watch my stack double
This goes out to all those gettin paid
Who flex muscle get their hustle on each and every day

If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all my city-slicker niggas feelin nice
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the pretty ladies keep your hair tight
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the gangstas bangin t-shirt white
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the hustlas' makin' moves at street lights

A rebel without a cause is full of flaws
In this city prepare to take a loss but be a workhorse
Fall off not the agenda
I hustle
]From december all the way to next december
That's from winter to winter
Use my 4-digit pin code then press enter
And send another deposit
Meanwhile I'm debatin with my realtor on what size lot to get
Profit I gotta gain
Keep it simple and plain give thanks and maintain
Now tell me do you know my name?
Or are you one of those who hates all the liquid MC fame
The percent I get double fifty
Spank
L.A. slicka in the powder blue Griffeys
We like rims that's tight
Fog lights drive through city nights
Sunsets to city nights

If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all my city-slicker niggas feelin nice
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the pretty ladies keep your hair tight
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the gangstas bang t-shirt white
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the hustlas makin move streetlight
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all my city-slicker niggas feelin nice
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the pretty ladies keep your nails tight
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the b-boys ???? in the sky
If I say it once
Then i say it twice
This for all the low low ridas like to ride
