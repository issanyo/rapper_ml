[Prevail]
It's catastrophic, if you lose your optic in this market
With heavy bags of garbage floating in the tar-pit
It's strange, like chemical trips down Aspirin lane
Tobacco and Shane, me and Mary-Jane
We've all got a clutch that can shift us to want
It's the amount that you grab when you get to the pot
Cause this only recognizes time that ticks
I enter the building to blow out the bricks
My statements, got to get it fixed like a patient
I love it, it pushes my brain to non-complacence
Numbing out the pain, pulling ribs out of stomachs
All because of the fear geared by outer limits

[Mad Child]
We some thought provokers for weed smokers that need focus
No hocus-pocus, just your lead vocals
Wrap round your head and choke cold local yocals
Till your face turn purple, can't break this sacred circle
I'm a mathmatician with a master vision
You have to listen, focus on business, not who's ass you're kissing
Lit the flame, got mass support
I'mma pass the torch, if you're asking for it, if you got passion for it
This is an example of substance abuse
Loving abuse, consuming a few in a hotel room with a view
And I love giving the same answers to the same fucking questions
Love signing burnt CD's at these autograph sessions
Love getting drunk for my shows and stage diving
And putting my life in the hands of the tour bus driver
Love taking planes and vicious bitches with no names
I love to get home, unpack just to pack up and do it again
You ready J?
