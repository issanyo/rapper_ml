[Evidence]
These are age times, these are fine wines
Let's take it all back to the top, these are grapevines
These are space rhymes, this is Slow Flow
I'd kick a rhyme about space and probably never go though
Probably never no-show, once a day they said and if I did
Probably be the shit that I'd be forever regretting
You chop confetti all down to smaller pieces
1999, party down for all releases
Started with the thesis then I end with the conclusion
Order is irrelevant, the purpose is confusion
Using my illusion seeing backdrops of pyro
Tons of marijuana packaged up inside a silo
I was thinking 'bout my rivals and forgot that I had none
Peaceful shit is dead to me, to me I'm trying to add one
Sniper with the bad gun, AR and the Magnum
Rifle and a condom, bullet that'll tag 'em

[Alchemist]
Carve headstones, throw on the headphones
Rewind it back to the top, I write gemstones
Orchestrations that end with a crescendo
Imitations, oregano, pretendo
Not that deal, I'm fly on my bicycle wheel
Time to kill, roll to Venice Beach and throw around the peel
Rope down a whale, sun shining, boats out to sail
I'm a little too close to success now to fail
So ride with me on this journey
I'm on my Worthy, coast to coast
Big game James, throw on a derby
California corazon, that's love
I lay in the cut like cortisone
