[Intro]
(dough d-dough d-dough)
(How much can you get for your soul)
It's EV
Evidence, Cookbook, Uno Mas
(when you rock and roll)
Let's go!

[Verse 1: CookBook]
Honeys know that money is the thing that they want
And brothers know that money is the thing that they want
And both'll hit the block and try to hustle it up
In the club sellin' they souls (When you rock and roll)
Brothers'll fight for that (Money Money)
That dough will make the closest friendship start to feel funny
Your homie that you run with starts to hide certain agendas
Suddenly the great pretenda
Don't even bring it to the world of rap music
When we're broke, it's buddy-buddy
Money comes, you start to lose it
Your group starts with a dream to change the scene and change things
Behind the scenes, they fighting 'bout the same things
(When you rock and roll)
You can't survive without that
(Money Money)
Record companies give little, but want everything from me
I signed it like a dummy, now I lost my control
Gave away my soul just so I could rock and roll

[Hook]
How much can you get for your soul?
W-when you rock and roll

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Hit the road, pack my bags, say goodbye
You know heroes get remembered, but legends never die
So I never say never, and never ask why
They pay no tolls, I guess that comes
(when you rock and roll)
Right, doin' shows now there's (money, money)
Last year you was dumb and out, broke and bummy (crazy)
They used to want advice, now they tryin to son me
It's funny how the tides change, y' know?
(when you rock and roll)
Cash in pocket, big bank, money fold
Accounts drained, but keep a green gangster' s roll
They keep they thanks and they praise on hold
Things for granted no matter the debt, never owed
(when you rock and roll)
Small change or big (money money) cha- ching!
I'm broke they don' t call, I got loot they love me
I know both sides of the fence; some days I feel like Mike
Other days Evidence
He's rock and roll

[Hook]
How much can you get for your soul?
W-when you rock and roll

[Verse 3: Uno Mas]
Yeah, everyday
Another day, another rhyme
Flippin' pennies to a dime
Over ten plus years been tryna earn my shine
Make moves, stay ahead of the game, and stack dough
Keep your business on point, yeah (when you rock and roll)
Everybody want that (money money)
Survival of the fittest and I'm tryna stay hunger
Keep the work ethic up, nothing's given, nothing free
If you got a lot to lose, then don't be an emcee
This industry will pimp you out like they own the block
If your stock don't rise, then you might get locked
Doin' time cause you signed
Your career's on hold
Live and learn or get burned c'mon (when you rock and roll)
Wack emcees making (money money)
You can find me in the lab doin' work, living grimy
Nothin' shiny on my neck, but I got mic control
And that's the only thing you need when you
(when you rock and roll)
