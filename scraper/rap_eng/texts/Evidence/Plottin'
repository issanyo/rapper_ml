[Vince Staples]
Alright, Alright, Alright, Alright
Hug the hammer like a proud parent
Cause I done heard more gunshots then crowds cheering
Followed up by loud sirens, moms cryin'
Non-violence just means you scared nigga
It's just the slave in him
Puttin' in that work see we was made winners
I started just like you but times change
When you running from that time
And that case sittin'
And Smalls got caught cause he ain't kill him
He inside and they ain't so how they ain't snitchin
You going hard in the paint but see the plays missing
Snakes hissing in the grass but you can't hear them
Round here life too hard to be god fearing
Con can't work no job, so con rob nigga
Good guy call up cop so cop got stitchin'
Palms itchin', That thang loaded
And we ain't playing no games with it
I stay on it it's Coldchain nigga

[Hook]
Mama knows I ain't living right (right)
But my pockets ain't sitting right (right)
So I'm riding with the choppa on me
Catch him slippin
Gotta get him
Cause they plottin on me
They plottin on me
Money coming friends going so I got it on me
I'm riding with the choppa on me
Get it crackin never lacking cause I got it on me

[A$ton Matthews]
Can't stop won't stop
Drug traffick though the roadblocks
Put your main bitch on nose watch
I run the field with two twins they both Glocks
And they gon knock I slang pussies and dome mops
(Oooh) I practice what I preach huh?
Young savage in these streets huh?
Set up where you sleep huh?
And if you ain't in it then we settle for yo niece huh?
Get off in that Nissan schooooo
I'm numb to the homicides
Ain't no love for the other side we let'em fly
Young killers on a ride you choose a side
You do the snitching we do the crime
We do or die
Seen it all but my place in heaven
Or am I hell bound
Cause I cover your momma screaming with shell sounds
Get down or get laid down
Cutthroat, spray where you hang 'round (motherfucker)

[Hook]
Mama knows I ain't living right (right)
But my pockets ain't sitting right (right)
So I'm riding with the choppa on me
Catch him slippin
Gotta get him
Cause they plottin on me
They plottin on me
Money coming friends going so I got it on me
I'm riding with the choppa on me
Get it crackin never lacking cause I got it on me
