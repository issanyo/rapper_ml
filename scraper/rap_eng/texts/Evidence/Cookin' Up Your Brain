[Intro]
Move it forward. Move ahead

[Verse One]
I rock fatigues but I don't glorify warfare
I need comfort stability, survival wear
I see everyday struggle
Word to Xzibit, lift, build muscle I hustle
And broaden my horizons
Stay focused to the point of the chin like Tyson
Get live like a dunk on a big man by Allen Iverson
Hold up, wait a minute, pause, check the stat
Words to James Brown, I say it loud I'm proud to be black
Whoever said that "knowledge on wax is played out."
Played themselves
They're soon to fade out
Way out
Out into oblivion
They come a dime a dozen, artificial like silicon
While I'm low like James Bond
At a bench on the lawn
Reading books like Wretched Of The Earth by Frantz Fanon
So if you live a lie may the truth set you free
Cause soon a day will come when we rise, it's all prophecy

[Hook] {x2}
Without knowledge of self you got no clue so I must
"Run through, Hard Boil you" - Capone N Noreaga 'Parole Violators'
Cooking up your brain you remain blind to what's brand new
So I must
"Run through, Hard Boil you"

"Back with more hot shit" - Mobb Deep 'Hell On Earth'

[Verse Two]
See too many brothers I meet wanna be buddies
Get drunk and burn skunk but they don't wanna study
Instead when they talk they're think they heavy like lead
But in reality, kid's knowledge base be like a thread
Minimal
With no foundation in the spiritual
Destroying they physical becomes a lifelong ritual
Now don't get me wrong ain't nothing wrong with a drink
But what's wrong is when a nigga just drink and don't think
About the change
Raped of language and names
Master Johnson's is the plantation where I must've slaved
In the former life
Cause that's my last name
I love my pops
But still bare a tag of shame
Maybe you can't understand the strength of the motherland
Cause you've been tricked with the teachings
Developed by the other man, brother man
It's never too late to set your mind state straight
Knowledge is key
We struggle then there's victory

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Niggas rhyme about guns and cheese
Tons and keys
They self incriminate on tapes, wax and CD's
No need for video surveillance
Cause all one time gotta do is buy your tape
And start playing it
Unless it's all made up type fiction
Have you forgotten that young minds listen?
And duplicate?
Oh you that brother likes to glorify jail time
Instead of dropping gems to uplift the black youth's mind
Now who's to blame when the devil control's the game?
That the black people play for this entertainment fame
No one to blame but ourselves
Instead of books
Now we love to be crooks and glorify Hell
Don't try to sell me that bullshit
Cause with knowledge I come equipped
Too much pain in the past to forget
About the lynchings
The ships
The leather whips
Niggas lie for luchi now-a-days and still get pimped

[Hook]
