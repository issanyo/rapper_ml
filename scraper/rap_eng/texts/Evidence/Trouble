[Intro]
Just to be like this
I look for trouble, if that's what you wanna call it
(I don't look for trouble, I'm already trouble [x4])

[Verse 1: Rakaa Iriscience]
Vampires feed on flesh blood, money runs the show
Fuck how they feel about it, seen the waves come and go
But watch yo step with this warm and critic sound their horn
They'll throw flowers at your feet, the roses with the thorns
Marathon tours, learned to maintain my pace
Generations sacrificed for the paper chase
And I ain't talking age, but they will respect my space
Old cats put in a home, young cats put in their place

[Verse 2: Evidence]
We get high, this my sworn in statement
Hand on the good book is more than makeshift
I never lie on any people are places
Bagging a chick or rocking on these stages
There's no such thing as half way aces
Inside and outside the box it's placement
Didn't grow up in the hood, adjacent
But close enough to hear the ghetto bird awaken

[Hook]
Hands up! (Trouble)
3 of the 1 of a kind
That means trouble
You don't have to look for it to find you're in trouble
Don't start none, there won't be no trouble

[Verse 3: Evidence]
I'm already on the double, trouble's nothing new
About to burst out this bubble I'm accustomed to
Straight out the W, do unto others
Do not stay in a box, not until the day they cover you
I'm covered plenty here, movement of the shutter slow
A blurry image at the finish when I cut a rope
And I ain't cutting dope, but I'm known for something great
Some known for treble up, some known for pumping bass

[Verse 4: Rakaa Iriscience]
Heavy hands knock the image out with steady cams
Rakaa chanting "Z's up!", amateurs just freeze up
Mad craze like Harmanov, kids get your problems solved
Spit it so Kalashnikov, spill it so Molotov
I'm Kasparov slash Pavlov to these lap dogs
Yapping under tables or staring hoping that scraps fall
Checkmate savage, war chest in the cabinet
I'm so adjective that I verb nouns, imagine it

[Hook]
