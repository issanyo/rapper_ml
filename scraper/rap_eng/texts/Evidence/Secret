[Verse One]
I kinda feel I don't get my just due
I say y'all trippin', they say "it's just you"
I just chuckle, cause I'mma wait for my time
And I'mma blow the roof off this motherfucker
Until then I'mma play the role, not the herb
So when it's my time to go, you just say the word
Fuck this that and the third
I'mma makin' my own lane
Heed my words or you can eat the curb
And I ain't acting
So you can bet your last buck boy
I ain't breathing if I ain't rappin'
I'm dead real with it
I steppin' in the game
With a dollar and an attitude and I'm still with it
Admit it
Joe shitted
On everybody you thought was hot, homeboy so forget it
Ask about me, go and tell a friend
I'm the best kept secret, let me tell you again

[Hook] {x2}
I'm the best kept secret
Shhhh, be quiet, don't leak it, don't make a sound
Cause when I come through stuntin'
I ain't frontin', me and my team we lockin' shit down

[Verse Two]
I know it makes y'all sick
To know I'm still talkin' shit, still holdin' my dick
And it's still the same clique
HOJ, that's the fam, get it right, we legit
You wanna throw me in the mix?
Don't be mad when you get played in front of your chick
If Paul Wall got the 'net goin' nuts
Guess you can say I got them fools throwin' fits
And everybody's in a frenzy
They like, "Who is he?" "I don't know but the boy get's busy."
I don't play yo
I grind like I still hold a 9 to 5 so that's why they call me J.O
And for the pesos, you don't wanna face Joe
A king ain't shit, hold up, I got an ace bro
And you can doubt me
But when I take yo' stash, yo' ass gon' wanna know about me

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
So by now, fuck a secret
If you ain't know, I'mma have to let a motherfucker feel it
You wanna act like, every time I touch that mic
J.O. ain't fuck around and kill it
Been in a video
Been on tours
Been on girls, prolly been on yours
Been overseas, came back to the 'Cac
See I been on The Shield, talkin' shit to Vic Mackie
With no album
And no deal
L.B. helped but damn that boy real
I swear to God
If my swagger was money I'd be worth like three or four mil
So this year I won't stop till I pop
Numbers through the roof, haters on my jock
Your boy's sure shot and this here's a warning
You Portland and y'all fools passed on Mike Jordan

[Hook]
