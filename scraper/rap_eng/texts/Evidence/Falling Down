[Intro:]
They say that when it rains it pours
They're right

[Hook:]
Falling from out of the sky
It's falling down on me
Praying come down, fall down
Praying come down, fall down
Falling from out of the sky

[Verse 1]
When I forgot to close the blinds I couldn't sleep
Kept waking up from all the shine, glare in my eyes
I'm off three hours, eat, sleep, repeat grind again
It's what he does that others don't do is what's defining him
I never would've thought the words wrote on a page
Would have me on the other side of earth on a stage
I never would've thought there was a stage on earth
That made me feel more at home besides my place of birth
I'm from gun-slinging CA where every movie's watched
Then watched back for instant replay
So many days and nights with ink bleeding papers
Fall asleep on flights, call it sleeping with strangers
Now back to the City of Angels where the rain is

[Hook]
Falling from out of the sky
It's falling down on me
Praying come down, fall down
Praying come down, fall down
Falling from out of the sky

[Verse 2]
I simplify by design, my words get scribed
To the vinyl when they rhyme, mark it with a scribe
Count lessons, toes, fingers, I'm alive
I've passed so many lows to survive all the highs
I've learned some things and others learned to tolerate (like what?)
You can be a day short but not a dollar late
New day in [?] chainlink, put it together
Beat the drum, pray for rain, we ain't the same under the weather
Just me against the world on the verge of relentless
Trying to stay apart like each word of the sentence
King vs. apprentice, champ vs. challenger
The challenger swung, the champ fell, they kicked him out of there
I throw raps to sea in a bottle to float
Like a lost SOS that the novelist wrote
The wind blew and popped the top, they read the letter
To whom it may concern, my sick words under the weather

[Hook]
Falling from out of the sky
It's falling down on me
Praying come down, fall down
Praying come down, fall down
Falling from out of the sky

[Verse 3]
So I forgot to change the time showing up early
With my money on my mind trying to keep from crime
One of a kind, I'm defined by my environment
For everything I did from inception to retirement
Cause I be running on unleaded fumes
Collecting money back for sacks fronted for the rent is due
A daydreamer still running towards the rainbow's ending
Knowing damn well the gold wasn't meant for spending
You ten cents from a nickel in your pocket
Shit, I'm thirty short of twenty dollars in my wallet yeah
You might need twelve fingers for the runners
Maybe six on the hand, half a dozen on the other
I bundle up brown gloves for the summer
Shorts in the winter with a slicker and umbrella
A fella chasing cheese like he running a maze
But really I'm just running in place, I need the bread to start

[Hook]
Falling from out of the sky
It's falling down on me
Praying come down, fall down
Praying come down, fall down
Falling from out of the sky
