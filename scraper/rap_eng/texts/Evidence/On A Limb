[Samiyam]
Once again I'm out on a limb, now I can hear the change in the sound of the wind
One day winds down to an end another's bound to begin
These fake friends, diabolical grins, I feel the ground wearing thin
I wish to be absolved from my sins, but if tomorrow I was ten I'd probably to all of it again
So I'm backed against the wall with a pen, cause everything allowed me to win was always found from within
So I'm thinking, searching, times I was hurting when a thin curtain of trust revealed a whole different person
Shit can worsen or it can get better and bonds that once were made of flesh and blood stiffen a leather
And people take it how you take it life is what you make it
Although my shirt's worth 200 sometimes I feel naked cause it's a cold world after all, you either dance or you fall, life's on the line, answer the call
Take a chance to advance through it all, even when circumstance is a wall, I'm on the way

[Evidence]
I’m on the way
Yeah, uh, yeah
Once again it’s the kid and I’m out on a limb
I break the branch off the tree and
Hit the ground and begin
Fallin face first till I hit my face in the dirt
And picked my self back up
A new taste for these beats, church
I read the book and even captured some, words
I thought the worst was a chapter that was past and done
I guess it ain’t so, spraying all this paint slow
They see the trash man, but I just see an angel
I guess my late show was half way there
But what good is half full if this glass ain't shared?
I flick an ash for my cats that ain’t here, sip a beer
Never ready to die, though I act prepared
And this the time that I crash and flare
Lighten up the whole street witha glare
I picked myself back up put and my weed in the air
And told the world: believe in me, and we’re leavin it there
