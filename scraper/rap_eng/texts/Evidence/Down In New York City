[Intro]
I'm from C-A, L-I, F-L-Y
(down in New York City)

[Hook]
Yeah, no fear, no love, no pity
Where everybody's attitude is shi-.. on the transit
Listen, in the hood where the mixtapes bang
They'll snatch your chain if you're not (down in New York City)
Where people never sleep, the sun could always hide
The place where Pun, JMJ, and Big ain't died
No, they're still alive through the sounds of the street
Violate and get your ass beat (down in New York City)
Yeah, I rep the West because I'm from out there
Still shop in 125 or the Albee Square
If you're askin' me to choose the two, don't compare
Still find me anywhere getting (down in New York City)

[Verse 1]
Five hours, the flight was rough
Scared of heights but don't never get high enough
LAX to JFK, my bird at the baggage claim
Waiting when I touch (down in New York City)
Got my mind running miles a minute
Got my eyes on the prize, backseat I'm sittin' (yeah)
Only been twenty minutes since the plane was towed in
Damn! She's already goin' (down in New York City)
Yeah, watching the lights
Cop paged, dropped her off (Washington Heights)
Back to Midtown, check in, hit the night
We getting right, we stepping out (down in New York City)
I gets busy, call Alchemist
Town on smash, ain't nobody doubtin' us
Peace first, if not, then I'll adjust
Don't ever try to lay me down (down in New York City)

[Chorus (cuts by DJ Revolution)]
We gets busy
(New York is still the same)
(Thought you knew how we do it)
And I'm from C-A, L-I, F-L-Y
(Representing) (West Coast)
But I'm (down in New York City)
E-V, that's Evidence
And my closet lookin like Bobbito shit
But I'm from C-A, L-I, F-L-Y
(New York City) (down in New York City)

[Verse 2]
If I have to choose a coast I have to choose the West
I was born out there, so don't go there
But you should see my peace in the East
Cookin rice and beans in the East (down in New York City)
In the air, yeah they breed hustlers
Short attention span, no shortage of customers
Hardest workers in the world, called services
Park Ave. purchases (down in New York City)
I wrote "Worst Comes to Worst" here
Was one of my best days before my worst fears
Before HeadQCourterz rest in peace
Spend a week up in D&D (down in New York City)
Yeah I found it, New York none liver
Got work to move, my dogs are cab drivers
So many heroes passed at Ground Zero
And y'all rebounding (down in New York City)

[Chorus (cuts by DJ Revolution)]
We gets busy
(New York is still the same)
(Thought you knew how we do it)
And I'm from C-A, L-I, F-L-Y
(Representing) (West Coast)
But I'm (down in New York City)
Yeah, the best from the West
Born from a queen in the East
God bless your soul, rest in peace
And I'm from C-A, L-I, F-L-Y
(Representing) (West Coast)
(New York City) (down in New York City)

[Hook]
No fear, no love, no pity
Where everybody's attitude is shi-.. on the transit
Listen, in the hood where the mixtapes bang
They'll snatch your chain if you're not (down in New York City)
Where people never sleep, the sun could always hide
The place where ODB and Scott La Rock ain't died
No, they're still alive through the sounds of the street
Violate and get your ass beat (down in New York City)
Yeah, I rep the West because I'm from out there
Still in 8th Street and Broadway copping a pair
If you're asking me to choose the two, don't compare
You still find me anywhere getting (down in New York City)

[Outro (cuts and scratches by DJ Revolution)]
(Say New York City!)
