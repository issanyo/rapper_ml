[Verse 1: Defari]
Filter all this noise like these beats on my ear
I'm really froggish, every year is leap year
Freshly cut to death, every week I'm off that chair
Taco Tuesday find your boy at the Savoy, savoir-faire
In Inglewood I'm really good, in Venice I get plenty bud
These niggas think they really good, reality they really none
They really like my little sons, they really like some little bums
They not even a factor in this burn, they really get no run
Ruby drop a ton of rhymes, a ton of beats I'm known to eat
I gotta eat like Megatron on Monday night against the Chiefs
I gotta bring my A game, my main frame 200 pounds
I'd rather dump 200 rounds and watch you fucks run out of town
This L.A. city all Southern section, true confessions
You bad ass little kids, you could all learn a lesson
I'm not stressing, and I surely ain't hiding behind no texting
Here I stand, just a man in all of his imperfections
