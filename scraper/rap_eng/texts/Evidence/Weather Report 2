Wow, just as expected, we're seeing record-breaking rainfall this week in California. It seems a whole state, from the Bay Area all the way to San Diego, is currently flooded, and it's only getting worse. I've also been told that Portland, Seattle and Vancouver are experiencing the same conditions. Current temperature is 60 degrees with the lows tonight in the 40s. All you commuters out there, please be careful. Stay tuned for more info all week. Signing off for now, your friend, Cap. CA a-a-a-a-all day
