[Verse 1: Evidence]
Lift the top off the glass cleaner
For all my aerosol tips
Now that I got my fat caps
We gon' take long trips
Matter of fact, my facts actually flip
The last shall be first
First gradually slip
I'm onto something
Words are just a part of it
Traveling man
Been touring for the art of it
Tremendous force when he rap they feel the kick after
It can teach you some shit but not the it factor
Some got it, some don't, some won't know 'til they try it out
Give it a go, give it your best
If it's happening, the symbols and signs
Like, people start to follow for no reason or rhyme
Just being 'round your aura makes 'em feel more important
If you harness all this energy, then you can make a fortune
I'm already rich so this is not an issue fortunately
Got my health, and got my son, the rest is all a mystery
Uh, nothing's unobtainable
I'm shooting for the stars, I land on clouds where the rainin' fall
I'm spitting color, mixing purple with that agent orange
When inspirations needed, that's what fashion Planet Asia's for

[Verse 2: Mach Hommy]
Some rappers rappin lackadaisical
Making soda, niggas know nothing that the half is capable
Baking soda hit the low end and vapor hit the glass evaporator too
That DMT release, I wanna grab an angel
Snatch a chain or two, chain, chain, chain
Miami Cuban with the flavor
Gucci by the time twelve mattered
I hadn't skated with the cables too
What happened to the rain with the sick rubies
Had tat-tatters mad as these garbage rappers, unrelatable
BGs on AZT
Shoulda, coulda, woulda perished if it wasn't for Dr. Sebi's Tea
Don't get your panties in a bunch
Canary flew out the mom black as tar
The jammy finna bust
