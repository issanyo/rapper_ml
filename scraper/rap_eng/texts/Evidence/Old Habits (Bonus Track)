I like what you got
Show me what you got
Show me what you got
Show me your flow
Show us what you got

I went from riding a bus and paying a fare
To crowds singing every word with their hands in the air

I might glance but I don't stare
I get paper so I don't care
I put an egg on a pan until it's based up
No problem or trouble to face I'm all based up
Old habits never die they just hide away
Old habits never die they just hibernate
They ask if I'm okay and I been great
My face never weathered and the lines are straight
Life is too short, my time is cake
It's the will, the win slash the line with fate
I'm never late, just delayed if it's sunny
I ain't a rich person, just a poor man with money
It's past lunch, ribs touch 'cause I'm hungry
Respect worldwide and not just my country

Slow motion. Feel me?
Words to live by
Words to die to

I arrive in the town and put down my bag
And maybe sign an autograph and put down my tag
The world is mine to roam so who can tell me don't
Do right or do wrong until I find my home
Road to Rome all signs are tolls
Lines I combed, defined by when lies are told
Paying fines up at pay phones at times of loans
And that's a sign of the time without a slight of my tone
Sold my soul to reels I don't own
And forgot about the song until the feeling is gone
[Fuck you thunder]
Til the ceiling is gone
And watched lightning shine bright off the light of the chrome
The world's greatest six footer rippin' parties apart
And I never killed nobody so no body was caught
I stay moving through my topics, views from the cockpit
Heavy represent, buy the album when I drop it

Words to live by
Words to die to
