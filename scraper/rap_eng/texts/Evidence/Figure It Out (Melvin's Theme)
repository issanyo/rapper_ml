[Intro]
Aye hold up hold up, wait through it
Let me roud the buffer
Let me do some shit real quick, man
Let me do something real quick
Who wanna battle me right now for ten G's?
Aye, who wanna see me?
Aye, you know I'm lying with y'all, I'm just bullshitting
Having fun? Aye aye aye
But check this out though, check this out, check this out
I wanna give love to all the future generation DJ's that's coming up
You know what I'm saying?
And keep it coming, homie, keep it coming
You know what I'm saying?
That's what we call the don't-give-a-fuck style
That's the dope shit right there

[Hook x2]
If you forgot my name, or my style
Warned this a few times, you figure it out
If you forgot my name, or my style
Rewind this a few times, you figure it out

[Bridge]
Whatever made you think I never bow down?
Fuck with me
Whatever made you think I never bow down?
Down my niggas surprised
Whatever made you think I never bow down?
Duck duck duck, who's the man?
Whatever made you think I never bow down?

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I'm going back to scratching, rapping, clapping
Got you realizing that Beat Junkies the sound
So since he came into town, you know he's shutting it down
And all the people can't get enough of his (hey!)
Speed it up, slow it down, either way

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
Put the needle on the record and the static sends chills through the body of a real DJ
The selector's dream is to only play the records that they feel and still be paid
Add it up, dance floors packed, plus armed if they want to come clash with us
DJ Babu, Dilated, world famous Beat Junkies crew, now catch the rush

[Hook]
