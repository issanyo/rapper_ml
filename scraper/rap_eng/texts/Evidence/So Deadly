[Chorus]
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
Swollen members, so deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
Make ya famous
Lettin you know
So deadly

[Evidence]
I used to get hype off getting little mentions
Then I started wantin more attention
Then I started wanting the whole crowd
To know every word of my shit, and sing it loud
(You out there?)
Yes we are, mess with Ev
You get my best
I'm trying to get these bars
Up, You know Ev is in the building
You know Ev is focused like Hype Williams
Except I don't yell "cut!"
And take two don't really happen that much
I'm tryin' to figure out a new rhyme, and a new dance
I'm the professional I always bring my plans (plants)
Started the show, they put dividers up
The second song, people climbing 'em (of course)
They always try but that shit don't work
So everybody move, nobody get hurt
Yeah

[Chrous]
Stomp. Clap. (Deadly) Move. Back
Swollen members, so deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
So deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You dont wanna mess with us
So deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You ain't ready yet, so deadly

[Madchild]
Screaming demons, howling tongues
Talented I'm the unbalanced one
Mentally challenged, I'm violent son
Impossible to tell where my style is from
Madchild's an egomaniac
My heads gigantic
Thick skull like a metal plate's been implanted
Stubborn as a bull don't tell me I'm an adult
I'm an animal dog, the way that I've been handling folks
Can't smoke cannabis, I'd need an ambulance
Choke off what Ev smoke, though I'm a fan of it
Place where I live, to the place where I stay
One foot in Vancouver, one foot in LA
Pounds come down, and the kegs go back up
Cars and planes and trains and Mack trucks
So hit us for that chron, when them bricks don't cut it
My people are the reason when this city gets flooded

[Chorus]
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
Swollen members, so deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
Dilated peoples in the motherfuckin' house
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You dont wanna mess with us
So deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
I dominate breaks
On tempo

[Evidence]
People are sleepin', it's the deep end
Slang these trees like its Christmas weekend
Who give a fuck about some brand new sneakers
I just got my brand new Genelec speakers
Ya heard, i'm rollin' my herb
On a picture of myself on the cover of Urb
We all players with no ref
Evidence ever since I came in the game I never left

[Madchild]
I got a mistress, and a a mistress for my mistress
My main girl gets an X-5 for Christmas
Tried just one, but they're all so delicious
You got a full plate? I got a whole set of dishes
Shoe-box hidden full of videos and pictures
I don't refer to them as bitches
My man put me on this date and I laughed
'Cause I ain't fuckin' with a bitch less than an eight and a half (whoops)

[Chorus]
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
Swollen members, so deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You already know who it is
On tempto
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You dont wanna mess with us
So deadly
Stomp. Clap. Move. Back
You ain't ready yet, so deadly
