[Verse One: Rapper Big Pooh]
Early morning till late afternoon
Sun came up, just a little too soon
Frosted Flakes and milk on the spoon
I know I'm grown, but I watch cartoons
Ha
Kinda remind me of my youth
When it was okay if you act uncouth
Mama always said to me, "Tell the truth"
So why rappers now lie in the booth?
Ha, I'm done drinking the juice
I shower up, get some fresh ideas
Jump on the phone with a few peers
They all say that this is my year
Gassing me up, but it's good to hear
It's like, the equivalent to a cheer
It's like, the opposite of a smear
Take a picture, how I look from here

[Hook: U-N-I]
Put your glasses up, you can roll it up
You can drink to this, you can smoke to this
You can roll to this, put your windows down
And pump the sound through any hood
It feels good
Just a beautiful day
It feels so good
Just a beautiful day
It feels so good
Just a beautiful day
Just pump it up and just vibe

[Verse Two: U-N-I]
Ahhh
Mohawk with the V-neck
Skinny jeans and some kicks you ain't seen yet
Kinda hard to ignore what they say
Why criticize the dude, I'm just trying to get paid
Hey, just a beautiful day
Crave for some cereal but Pooh ate the Flakes
Throw an omelette on the plate
Sean can't rest on the back in the sun I make it rain

[U-N-I]
It's like
The sunset at a beach with a freak
Truth or Dare elementary, trying to get a piece
Hoover cruise in the breeze bumping Al Greene
With my sunroof cracked, bucket seat on lean
Life is a canvas and the sun is a splash of DaVinci
A dash of the izzy
To keep the ladies in tune with what I gotta say
Paint the world gold on this beautiful day

[Evidence]
I'm still high as shit
Still can't tell which Nina Sky is which
Still trying to find my pitch
I call you my biatch but never my boo
I get inspired by the weed too
Fake crews, the choice is yours now choose
I paid dues, I played at Paid Dues
Fuck the A-List, I was never one for school
The mood swings he ain't a slouch
A living legend in the making, they called him a Grouch
He opened his mouth and words came out
On a beautiful day the paper boy's in route
On GT bike, Dog Town is south
Side of Santa Monica to Venice Beach
My people is wild
And it's a perfect day, keeping a smile
And you and I/U.N.I. both know killing this crowd

[Hook]

[U-N-I]
I'm driving round town with my camera click down on my side
No fronting, just in case I could've wrote something
Hit record when it's time for me to quote something
And if Barack running yeah I'm gonna vote something
Cause I'm political and times are critical
Another popular example is the blackness is pitiful
Shit
I almost had to revoke my membership
Pick a different pigment that would respect my penmanship
But then I thought about it, damn we created this
Why we let 'em take it when at first they all hated this
From the most conscious to the most X-rated
It's like Rakim to Luke and if I took time and made a list
You would understand what I mean
It's not about just rhyming
It's about what you stand for and a little bit of timing
With a whole lot of guidance for the new school that's on it's way
Let them experience a beautiful day

[Hook: Aloe Blac]
It's such a beautiful day
Hey, hey
Suns out, lay in the shade
Oh, oh
It's such beautiful day
It's such beautiful day
Don't miss the rain
I don't miss the rain
I don't miss the rain

[Verse: Mickey Factz]
Clean my Supras and set outside
See a dime I had a crush on give me the eye
At the same time I find a hundred dollar bill
So I ask shorty if she wanna chill
She love my frames, I love hers
She's not wearing shades, just curves
I'm into her brain, no words
Music to my ears, no Itunes help
Now I know how Ice Cube felt
What a beautiful day

[Fashawn]
I awake to palm trees and good weed
California sunshine and a cool breeze
Slip on my MJ's, the number threes
Wondering how to get some money in my dungarees
Hit the strip, not hard to find a fly diva
Summer time, Zodiac sign, blessed a Libra
It's about 70 degrees and I must say
Today is a beautiful day
Can't complain

[Hook]

[Theo]
It's a beautiful day up on the east coast
Sun shining, butter on my light toast
I'm a breakfast man, who wants breakfast man?
Pancake, french toast, I'm a breakfast fan
Tom & Jerry playing on the toons
So rude how Tom wants to turn Jerry into food
Either way I laugh, cause either way I'm crashed
On a sofa, cool as a coaster

[U-N-I]
We hit sunset with the windows down
The Alpine speaks, it's A Love Supreme
Squeeze four honies in the back for now
Cafe Primo is the place to eat
I swear
I live a vacation
With all the pussy in L.A. no need for masturbation
If it's the end
To make my day complete, I need Lauren London as a friend

[Kes Kaos]
Natural high
Hands in the sky
You close your eyes you can almost touch Heaven
Though we're below, where clouds precipitate
We'll dance in the rain till the puddles go away
With this on replay, blow away the grey
Till the sky's like the ocean but it ripples with bass
Watch the sun, shine for the kids
It's such a beautiful, you know what it is
