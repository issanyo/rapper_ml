The whispers at night talk with the death diction
Ambition and intuition, keep your distance
Sometimes I look at my pistol, I'm all tempted
All MC's after me, it's my descendant
Shatter your defences, ambushes, dramatical intentions
Irrational your business, fabricate irrational decisions
Execute your pastor as no witness
Spreading false lies, causing sickness
Elaborate your vision, can't let 'em keep down and small
At night fall, your renegade is all small
You sweeter than a minute maid, I'm all raw
Razor blade, Iron Man, hell spawn, you just play the pawn
I hold it down for the crown, shells erode(?) the smell
Night menace, when I attack they say "Man down!"
Sniffing for the blood like a hell hound
Sitting on the shell mounds
Squeezing out the Gatlin is spell clown(?)
