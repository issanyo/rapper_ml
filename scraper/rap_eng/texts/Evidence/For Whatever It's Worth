[Intro: Talking]

Yeah
It’s in your pocket
EV
Let it ride out for a sec
I’ma speak my peace
Some focus on what I do heavily
Others have no idea
I keep doin it man
Don’t stop
I got love
Even I got some doubts some times man
I’ma let you in

[Verse 1]

Just knowing that you know who I am is enough
What if we meet up and I don’t even have the right touch?
That’s the reason the number posted up ain’t called
I be beat up so I just paint a picture – call
Perfect where I don’t try new shit, nothin’s hurtin
No pain comes and goes, nothing’s workin
No highs, no lows, different days might be round the corner
Still no expression, no sign on my face shows
Those that pay close attention might sense it
Whatever it’s worth I make sense but still fenced in
Sent in by the man upstairs destined
The message is so great you start wrestling
With thoughts of failure, maybe I can barely float
With these sharks surroundin the boat
But then the hope comes, it’s like the light cut through the clouds
Girls cutting em down, rappers buckin em down
There’s nothing I found, my first for better or worse
I ain’t tryin to boast, just whatever it’s worth
I’m the next one up to bat to bring it home
I’m the popular vote, it’s medicine from the earth

[Hook]

For whatever it’s worth
Yeah, whatever’s it’s worth
Staying on my grind
24/7/365
Regardless of what they say, man

For whatever it’s worth
Family’s first
I’m gonna stick to what I stick to
Let them talk, say what they wanna say

I’mma have the last laugh in the end, always remember
For whatever it’s worth

[Verse 2]

Sense a change, I stay alert these days
Never settling, it’s better than peddlin work
I’m so invested, the rest is up to him
Unless destiny gonna test it first
Bills make themselves, honest though it hurts
I used to love her till the condom broke
And what’s worse is your first love never goes away
When you’re first on a different page
I’m first to say, I’m first to stay dilated
Whether size of the purse or the stage that I’m takin
Money don’t grow on trees but when it come it fall like leaves
I’mma have my rake out, I’mma chip up and cake out, mash out
For whatever it’s worth, I’mma chip up and cash out
I bang with the best and not with a vest on
Ain’t who you guessed, underestimated, slept on
Without me, no case to rest on
I don’t give orders, I make suggestions
A brand to trust, I place bets on

[Hook]
