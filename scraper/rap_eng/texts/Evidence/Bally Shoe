[Verse 1: Psycho Les]
It's that shit, it's that hardcore shit
Who is it, it's the second hand record man
Blowin' smoke in your face, you catchin' second hand
Make you choke off the toke like a bowtie
I smoke the hash every day, look I'm so high
Alchemist chop the beat like, Oh my
We got another hit straight out the goldmine
In New York I make a phone call and go get it
In California I just walk up in the fuckin' clinic
And get medicated, smoke a blunt and start meditating
Criss Angel levitating, I'm dedicating
This to all beat diggers and groupies that sleep with us
After the show, peace bitches
Grab the Henny, we goin' back to the telly
I'ma urine on your face and take a crap on your belly
And do the R. Kelly, now take a shower ho
It's too powerful

[Verse 2: Fargo]
You know how it is, when you're walkin' down the corner
Kickin' it on maron doner, streets is hotter than a sauna
Don't matter if you in New York or California
It's all about making that payola
And if you try to stunt we're gonna run up on ya on some Dirty Harry shit
You try to pull a fast one, fuck around hold your fam for ransom
Smash you in your face with a .44 Magnum
To all the fake cats try'na hate, cocksuckers bragging like they got that cake
You ain't an OG from the old school, bitch nigga broke the number one rule
Fuckin' wit' jakes, yapping away, dropping jewels
Now I'm here to regulate, dead you on your papes and wait
Put a hole in your face, and you won't be recognized at your wake
Fuckin' snake

[Verse 3: Alchemist]
Out of order, these motherfuckers cannot manage
Slap 'em up and wrap 'em up just like a bandage
Innovative, I animate on the canvas
Work magic, crash the board like Kurt Rambis
On the rebound, sit on the throne, no need to be crowned
It's the reign now, get it poppin' soon as I lay the beat down
Steamroller the pebbles level the street down
Impossible for me to turn the heat down, the switch broke
Circle through a cloud of marijuana spliff smoke
Clip though, I bully foot over tracks, you tip-toe
Display butter flavor like a rich Nabisco
I punch hits, working with my fists like Klitschko
I rapidly pitch, gorilla pimp, open handedly slap a bitch
Material sewn without a stitch
Gets me riches, diamonds, cars, valuables
How we do, your crusty foot's not equipped to fit inside of my Bally shoe

[Verse 4: Evidence]
I roll up to keep the doctor away
I never met Doc Drew but met Doc Dre
Never Doc J in my '86 weapons
To every session, shot the lane and lit the entrance
It's E to the V, I see myself like the world does
Picture that can't stand still until the world buzz
Riddle never solved till he stated the solution
Before drug smuggle you was covered in pollution
Runnin' round town without a buzz until you got one
Spot blown like he never had an option
Buildin' up the base in empty lots that pop up
The new sheriff got a shotgun
Yo I ain't makeshift and this is coming straight from the basement
We are the best, nothing in life will ever change, kid
You never know when the table turn aces
