[Verse 1: Evidence]
The spell of being broke can put a shade over anything
It's like happiness is done cloning over every being
Foward I run to the state of a melody
Won't open up for strangers no matter what they tellin' me
Selling me down the road with these yellow bricks
But won't stick around long enough to see developments
Foreign affair through these messages of vinyl sleeves
Last of a dying breed, kid I'm just trying to breathe
Tryin to breathe need at least a breath
Cause if I had one wish, it'd be a peaceful death
They can't, map you out they've been trying for years
There's no dollar amount so when they lying it's clear
People what you're buying is fear and feeding into
Beam the light, near the pain that you've been through
So much to say now but where do I begin though?
Staring out my four pointed room with no windows
No glare from the sun and no moon to hear the wind blow
Take this money, hear it out, spittin been colds

Sakura, sakura, ??
Sakura, sakura, ??

[Verse 2: Planet Asia]
Yeah
Hey yo thunder up myself in the booth
Knock out a lose tooth, roof the coop bar for the loot
Execution shoot words is water slaughter disorder
Your quarter with per edit and sorta
Leave you suckers and post-mortem
Slaves sin John through jugger flow
Jungle brother base line bars wash the spoon bandan' comes in the oracle
Orbital ballad, ill skin ballies central valley wing it
Intelligent but ignorant
Bigger repetitions, reptile in your rhyme rendition
Crime visions, blind missions orderly nine shine in neglicent
Click clack now who you dissin? Hogmart hugs
I'm in resistance to gift wrap roadin' right after Christmas list
Dismissed who can do it? This Chris missing
I'm the shit bitch lyrics gonorrhea, aids, the simpliest
What up tho? I'm all natural and nuts so
Forever front row
Y'all fucking with us? Fuck no..fuck no
