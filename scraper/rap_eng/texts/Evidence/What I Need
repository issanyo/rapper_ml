[Chorus]
And everyone it seems, it’s all be done, indeed
It’s all on different dreams, I get it from the seams
I’ve been up on the scene, I’ve been an in-between
I got a growing seed, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need

[Verse 1]
OK, go—okay, the K reloaded
His back against the wall, I’m back to face the ocean
I hope emotion is respectable
Question is: Is emotion superseding technical?
No question good as yours is what my guess is
But one finger count the times I’ve been arrested
No amount could count the times I’m blessed
No amount could count the times from stress
You now rockin’ with the best
Yeah, yet I’m still hungry
Humble in the same breath covering your country
Dirt all by my lonely
Push it to the limit like Miami hit the Tony
I give ‘em distance if they plan to get to know me
So the bet that might be the best is ante up and show me all the money
Playing every hand that isn’t phony
The game of life—you got a plan, I got it on me

[Chorus]
And everyone it seems, it’s all be done, indeed
It’s all on different dreams, I get it from the seams
I’ve been up on the scene, I’ve been an in-between
I got a growing seed, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need

[Verse 2]
Yo, a lot of people talkin’, a lot of speculation
Know he never quit ‘cause he built a reputation
People talkin’ ‘bout they seen him roamin’ the back streets
My neighborhood became a  place for actors and athletes
Used to be where art met crime
Now it’s where the rich keep apartments and stay part time
I ain’t trippin’, but another misfortune of the ghetto
Lost touch with my homies and the feeling never settled
A rose is still a rose with no petals
Some know limits, some know there’s no levels
I’ve been looking for the right time to switch address
So if I up and disappear, it’s no disrespect
I could start the day dwelling the pain
‘Cause when I wake up, my brain’s still on memory lane
Want my name remembered like the rest of us do
But if I’m living for my next life now, this one is through

[Chorus]
And everyone it seems, it’s all be done, indeed
It’s all on different dreams, I get it from the seams
I’ve been up on the scene, I’ve been an in-between
I got a growing seed, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need
(“I just need what I need”)
I’m gettin’ what I need
Fuck that, I’m gettin’ what I need
