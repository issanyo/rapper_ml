Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes....

Hybrid
I've been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology, big band theology, performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you MC's who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bombs, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira, I've put a kink in the backbones, of clones, with microphones
Never satisfied my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day over what you might say
My blood types krylon, Technicolor type A
On highways ripe with road rage
Cages a win, cages a tin, that bounce all around
Surround sound
Devouring the scenes
Subliminal gangrene paintings, over all the same things
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics
Fourth dimension, compact convention
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away, with the pencil
Pistol, official, sixteen line, a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out at your flaws
Spittin' rah blah, blah, blah you can say you saw

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Who's the man, demanding you hand over your Land Rover
The man's bolder than the Pharoahe when he jams you glance over
I am visclorosous, the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye, it's extremely high voltage

That's why I need ruby quartz glasses
'Cause when I glance there's a chance
That I might blast the masses
Subliminals transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated to nano

I use skills when I need pleas sees the rhyme
I hear when I bleed as I proceed through time
I walk through walls and the inanimate obstacles
By inducing the reduction of cells and molecules

I bring the knowledge the you swallow a state that's a hologram
I botch your head, fatten your lip like collagen
The telepath deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we are high voltage

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringin you up and takin' you down
High voltage
Comin at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide
