[Intro: Evidence]
It's love and war - It's love and war - It's love and war
We accommodate those

[Scratches: Prodigy]
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Let 'em know, young buck in the game
Started off hardheaded, stuck in my ways
But things change and days turn to nights
And nights are cold if your people ain't right
My squad it straight, split up the cake in three ways
My partners down, I'm feeling the pain
And when we up, find us out trying to live
I got lots of love for my crew, that is

[Iriscience]
Old soul in the game
I grew up stressed out trying to hold in the pain
But kept my mind right, sketched the highlights
I enjoy life but fight for my rights
And your right to fight for yours
I fight through forked tongues and spikes and swords
The days of thunder, the nights of tours
Its dope to fight the illness that fight the cures

[Scratches]
If it ain't family, I ain't sure
Love is love, war is war
They want theirs, they want yours
I got lots of love for my crew that is
Love is love, war is war
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
For my crew
For my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is

[Iriscience]
For the love of God
For the love of cats scrambling to beat the odds
Hustling and ducking in between the laws
For the love of my family, the streets are ours
For DJ's ripping these beats apart
We puff herb and spread love, like Peter Tosh
With magic, classic, we prove that shit
I got lots of love for my crew that is

[Evidence]
I'd rather swallow blood than pride
Between love and war is a thin line
It's a dangerous time
You better go for yours, cause I'm going for mine
I'm bout to chip in, no doubt before I leave the grind
Till then, it's plots how we gonna win
And how to turn your buds over to our next of kin
How your gonna stay focused to beat the game
And how your gonna see if you try to stop the bang

[Scratches]
If it ain't family, I ain't sure
Love is love, war is war
They want theirs, they want yours
I got lots of love for my crew that is
Love is love, war is war
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
For my crew
For my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
I got lots of love for my crew that is
