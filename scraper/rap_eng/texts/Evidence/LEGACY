[Chorus]
Yah, everyone 'bout to remember me
I don't care what you confess to me
Does it look like I care 'bout your remedy?
You ain't blown up, it ain't meant to be
Now I'm flying on all this amphetamine
It's controlling me, now I can't barely breathe
I need someone to help me before I sleep
Or else, this 'gon be my fucking legacy

[Verse 1]
Legacy, legacy, legacy
Oh, you're blowing up? Go ahead, let us see
Are you drowing your girls in the Hennesey?
Oh, well, you maybe you need to remember me
Maybe you need to remember the shit
That I fucking did for every last bitch
For everyone coming to me through the year
They want me to mix, they needed the kid
But now, who you kidding? You such a damn waste
A fucking mistake, you never done paid
You giving excuses, you're always so late
I give you exclusive shit all on a plate
You need to remember the very last day
Last time we exchanged, you talking 'bout me
Now you wanna act like you grown up, you ain't
Nah, bitch, I'm still done, get the fuck out my face
I could do it on my own, I do not need you right now
I do my shit all by myself, I don't need any clout
Cause I'm dropping this heat but you ain't checking out
All of the shit that the BOY$'ve been droppin'
Wait for December when shit'll be poppin'
I needed a break, now I'm back, I ain't stoppin'
[RUINED RAP]'s still on the way, yeah, I promise

[Chorus]
Everyone 'bout to remember me
I don't care what you confess to me
Does it look like I care 'bout your remedy?
You ain't blown up, it ain't meant to be
Now I'm flying on all this amphetamine
It's controlling me, now I can't barely breathe
I need someone to help me before I sleep
Or else, this 'gon be my fucking legacy

[Verse 2]
I take your bitch to the mall
She wantin' it all, she wantin' to see money fall
She's loving it all, I scream and I sing then I kill it
I need to relax a bit more
Cause I'm on a wave and I'm surfin'
Give a fuck if I die, it ain't worth it
Now I'm leaving the Earth, it ain't workin'
My shit'll take over galaxies, first thing
Ooh, who hoppin' on a jet?
Who fuckin' rockin' it?
Who made it lit? It's so obvious
Who done accomplished it?
Who changed the meaning of trap and the poppy shit?
Who is the one that you need? (that me)
You wrong if you ain't sayin' me (that me)
Cause I think you all sleeping on c. (that me)
Now I'ma  finish my damn legacy (that me)

[Chorus]
Everyone 'bout to remember me
I don't care what you confess to me
Does it look like I care 'bout your remedy?
You ain't blown up, it ain't meant to be
Now I'm flying on all this amphetamine
It's controlling me, now I can't barely breathe
I need someone to help me before I sleep
Or else, this 'gon be my fucking legacy

[Outro]
This my damn legacy (yah)
This my damn, this my damn legacy (yah, yah)
This my damn legacy (yah)
This my damn, this my damn legacy (yah, yah)
This my damn legacy (yah)
This my damn, this my damn legacy (yah, yah)
This my damn legacy (yah)
This my damn, this my damn legacy (yah)
