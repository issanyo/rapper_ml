[Intro]
It's everyone's intrest and the weather, here it is...
THIS IS THE COLD WEATHER
SO GET YOUR CLOAK AND UMBRELLA

[Hook: Evidence]
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Coats and umbrellas
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Umbrellas up to the sky
Cats and dogs, those people who call
I hit back before it's twice
As of late these mics don't reach too far
So I kill each bar like it's flashing lights
Taylor Made Records, my mom name lives on
Cold weather code letters: TMR
It's hard to be stopped when you got a meaning like this
I got a plot that's meanin' to kids
I'm part of the rest
I watch Rap City get upset
Kick a hole in my flatscreen
Scream and not jet
Then back to the scene of the west
They call me Mister
Don't make tunes for strippers
I'm one of the best

[Hook: Evidence]
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Coats and umbrellas
(That's what I mean by now, I'm on my way home)
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas
[DJ Scratching]
Exhale, that was halftime

[Verse 2: Evidence]
(THIS IS) The word worth of thousand pictures
You gotta mock us in tryna get a thousand bitches
That's how we drop it, to feel regret
I try to fill it in baguettes
Stuck on the painting when I picture in the silhouette
I be the best
I be great
I can waste my words or I can say free Tibet
Or maybe not think so global, but more local
Like the Lakers better rip anything what's next
Witty with the words, they never liked it
So beat me down, but couldn't get the best of Michael
From next town I came back a new recital
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
They show love, but that's a part of tour
I play the part and maybe that's the art of war
Or maybe why I started for, started from
Either one

[Hook: Evidence]
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Coats and umbrellas
(Umbrellas up to the sky)
(THIS IS) The cold weather
Cats and dogs, coats and umbrellas
[DJ Scratching till end]

[Outro]
Hi, I'm like an hour away from like an L.A
And it's snowing in California...
