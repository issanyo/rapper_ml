[Scratches]:
"I'm the next big thing, crown me king"
"I don't fuck around dunny, it's most real" - Prodigy 'Keep It Thoro'

[Verse One] [L.E.G.A.C.Y.]:
So just bow down like Japanese custom
I'm just fowl now, can't rap with me, trust him
I will crush them and anybody that loves them
Call me G&R, Appetite For Destruction
And that gun, also known as a ratchet
And that rose, I just lay it on his casket
Pouring out 'yac and I got the flowers
When I snap, I got the power
Rule with an iron fist, new with a lime twist
Stay gettin' faded, some say my mind's sick
Maybe that's why I do it, crazy how I fly through it
The turbulence, turn me merciless
I'm so sure that I show no mercy
I'm so pure, I might leave your nose coke thirsty
Hot boy, hot oil, every verse fryin'
Suicide Music will be the last album worth buyin'

[Hook] [L.E.G.A.C.Y.]:
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down

[Verse Two] [Evidence]:
Honest, I promise the clothes on us
A lot of us appear to be clean but drink an alcohol anonymous
I'm on that obvious
Policy, property, prosperity
Fuck the perception that I'm arrogant
Derelicts spittin' heroin
D.C., Maryland
Baltimore why I get inspired by Samaritans
Sometimes I write slow, sometimes I write quick shit
Despite the L.A. life I never clutched a biscuit
So listen up
Still lethal fuck the non-believers
I'm a leader, gearin' my troops to kill the bombest divas
I keep a high note like Amadeus
Until the drama sets in, they can't win cause the rhyme is as real as
Ev and L got it covered A to Z list
Train derail, live show they gotta see this
I excel they all fail to the bleachers
Impeach presidents through these E.V. speakers

[Hook] [L.E.G.A.C.Y.]:
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down

[Verse Three] [L.E.G.A.C.Y.]:
So just Bow Down like Westside Connect
I joust now, Leg ride to the death
Knights at the table
Actin' like I like labels
Playin' P.C., Music Factory like C+C
I need that
All the blind can see that
But those with good sight do anything for the good life
Funny how it happens
For money how they actin'
New thespians, good girls turned lesbians
If I'm beef with one person, I'll bury this town
Are the vultures out?
It's hard wearin' this crown
With great power comes great responsibility
I'm ready for the next war, all this calm is killin' me
Ready to press the button
Look at the feather's rufflin'
Show me the best, I'm crushin', see me it's nothin'
Took time off, but now it all seems
They all wanna be, down with the king

[Hook] [L.E.G.A.C.Y.]:
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down
Took time off but I'm on you ma'fuckas
I wish, I dare, I warned you ma'fuckas
Say my name on a record and it better be a shout out
I'm the same as ever, but better just bow down

"Bow down when you come to my town
Bow down when I'm westward bound
Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you" - Westside Connection
