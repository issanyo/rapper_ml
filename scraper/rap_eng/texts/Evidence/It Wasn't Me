[Intro]
Uh, about to tell you who I are
Came a long way and I still got so far to go
Tee off with this trademark flow
And after tonight
I'mma let the whole world know
My name is Evidence

[Hook]
You ain't got no
Evidence, evidence, evidence, evidence

[Verse 1]
If this is crime scene cinema
All the weed shops closed
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 4 for an O?
I don't know
I keep a rotary phone
So I remember all the numbers of my homies who gone
Proof is in the pudding
I'm pressed up and labeled "evidence"
But never chasing fame, dragons, chicks, or dead presidents
Dreams, but never snatch chains of any measurements
Because of my name, for every fuckin' crime they find the relevance
Choices in my life that I want to correct
I got voices in my head that I want to forget
Uh and I don't live with regret
But I've been living with a chick while other chicks try to text
It wasn't me

[Hook]
You ain't got no
Evidence (There's no proof without the)
Evidence (Who wants truth without the)
Evidence, evidence

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my first album only had underground appearances
So what's the outcome?
I'm still an underground lyricist
And fame don't even capture what my interest is
I'm halfway to famous, halfway away from infamous
My naked eyes are like my memory chips
Everything digested comes up when I spit
I say so be it
Without a whistle, call it how I see it (Yeah)
Whether in my boundaries or in another region
I'm speeding on the highway with my girl shotty
Keep a plant in my car, like Good Friday
Keep my world Godly
I stay grounded like my lobby
Tagging Buket on the wall but never tat it on my body
My music and my graf are livin' separate lifes
One gets me paid, the other's payin' the price
Either way they'll say I'm spraying at night
But how the fuck, when I'm touring overseas on a flight
It wasn't me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The flow's connected like I knew people
Director of photography, I shoot people
Named by Will.I.Am
Maybe made a milli, maybe I don't give a damn (True)
I thought of Evident
He mispronounced it, Evidence
Fast forward, here we are, standing in the present tense
I never thought about fame
I just thought about if KRS would know my name
But since then it's like so much has changed
Body baggin' the shows, they say I'm killing the stage
It wasn't me

[Hook]
