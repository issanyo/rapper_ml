When the cap fits
Grin and bear it
When the crew no longer clicks
Grin and bear it
When those beats don't hit
Grin and bear it
When it's time to call it quits
Grin and bear it

LMNO is the beddy bye blanket
Evidence crank it, if it bubbled I drank it
When it troubled I sank it to the floor
They washed up face first down at Belmont Shore
Umbilical cord
Pumps anti-animosity
These others must be joshin me
Tossin me hostility
Ruining ability
Savor your agility
Silly me, really he's
Full of insecurity
This isn't singular
It's plural
For all your boys and girls, check the better beat bureau
Got a renewal I'm never expired
Southern cali authority cannons stay fired
Tired of these sleepy-heads
Poor dreds, multibred, grateful dead
Misled, tires tread, overfed
Defensive defend
Offensive offend
Cordial conversations helps matters mend

When the cap fits
Grin and bear it
When the crew no longer clicks
Grin and bear it
When those beats don't hit
Grin and bear it
When it's time to call it quits
Grin and bear it
When life's the pits
Grin and bear it
Illegal or legit
Grin and bear it
They really should split
Grin and bear it, hey
Grin and bear it, hey
Grin and bear it

I'm plugged in, receiving
Like fax machines from preteens
Elders I absorb youthfully
Turn inner beauty out
Reversal
Pause for commercial
Short attention span rehearsal
Couldn't fill the gaps
Who's that puttin heart in it
DJs spinnin for recreation or radio station
Either or is it ignore
Get out if you're bored
My gas pedal's floored
The word of God roared
Tangled mic cords on stage is a snakepit
That's where the fake get
Sent without sunlight
Cryin' they've only done right when that's wrong
Word to mom
They've offended the concentrated temple
At times like these it's hard to stay gentle

When the cap fits
Grin and bear it
When the crew no longer clicks
Grin and bear it
When those beats don't hit
Grin and bear it
When it's time to call it quits
Grin and bear it
When life's the pits
Grin and bear it
Illegal or legit
Grin and bear it
They really should split
Grin and bear it, hey
Grin and bear it, hey
Grin and bear it
