[Hook: Samples]
Suddenly I hear a banging sound
I can hear the bass playing much too softly turn up the volume

[Verse 1 : Evidence]
Let me start with the evidence and kill the allegations
Its low treble high bass my kill for calibration
Syncing up perfect to the rhythm of my own kick
Driven by my own tone alone I make the poem fit
And I ain't known for taking no shit
I'm known for hi-fi and putting it on down the low bits
It's more hits, more green in scenery, they (turn up the volume)
It's man vs machinery
I am now to the future what the scene'll be
The decks'll probably wobble but they never fall easily
I rap repeatedly into a (?)
So we pouring out these bottles and there's more to recruit (I can hear the)
Voices in my head, telling me, Ev, you have just beasted
So why don't we respect the game and just, recess
I'm like fuck that, get the loot, save the queen
We got another fucking kill screen to reset

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Fashawn]
I slap the shit out of you with an aphorism
Attack the rhythm
More than a mac I'm a menace, shatter your Izm
I arrive, like I traveled in mach 5
And never caught a stop sign
And, disappear like a mad magician
On a savage mission
Chronic and Bali shag I'm twistin
Got a nigga feeling past the buildin, I'm so high
Fully loaded like a Glock 9 the minute they (Turn up the volume)
That's when I start to jot rhymes, And lock lines
I'm slick as an ox to the jugular
A prophet it's just not for the fuck of it uh uh
It's the mafia, suck a dick
Guns bigger than Theophilus London's Lips (I can hear the)
Cops coming, the spot jumping I'm getting ghost
From a block of young'ns with ox cutters hid in they coat
Won't stop thuggin you cocksuckers should get a dose
Simpletons listen close, truest spit I ever spoke
It's F

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Alchemist]
Ayyy Carumbaaa
Hang ten cowabunga
Amazing larry ride the wave without going under
Chop down a forest use a mac truck to tow the lumber
I wrung his neck then cut a blank check and wrote a number
Thou chow dumbeth (look in the skyyy)
It is I, Lord Steppington My cup overruneth
The Kosher man Ashevitte
Sell him a couch like the sofa man at Levitz
(Turn up the volume)
Rap so whoopdee friggin doo
I'm gettin yada yada
Breed is rare like a tasmanian chupacabra
Scuba diver, makeshift craft Macgyver
Bomb specialist
Dynamite blast survivor
Put out the fires
Peel off and burn the tires
Pull the wires
Screws loose I turn the pliers
Piss on your poster burn a stack of fliers
Burn dope and blow the smoke for promotion
Attract the buyers
