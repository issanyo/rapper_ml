[Hook]
You're now rocking with the west
So start moving towards the exit
When the next motherfucker
Lacking presence tries to set it

[Verse 1]
You're now rocking with the west and the rest happens naturally
I'm my best when I'm back into the factory
Welcome to my habitat, shaking off the tumbleweeds
Back to comfortable I kick the bench out from under me
And I don't know if God is watching
What I do know is that I got my options
A new beginning, who you kidding
I brought relief like the ninth inning
There's a reason why my friends sip codeine
I sat home at night banging so fresh and so clean
I got bars like I'm separating groceries
I'm celebrating globally, you're celebrating locally
Yo I can walk at the beach
Without a worry in the world the way I bob to a beat
Streets talk for a living, the sky with no ribbon
This is maximum return without the given

[Hook]
You're now rocking with the west
So start moving towards the exit
When the next motherfucker
Lacking presence tries to set it
You're now rocking with the west
So start moving towards the exit
When the next motherfucker
Lacking presence tries to set it

[Verse 2]
You're now rocking with the west and ain't no time for me to fumble
I took an oath to state it on the record while it rumbled
So welcome to the jungle where my people serve their clients
And they greet us like they meet us so it's peaceful never violent
Cuz I've been on assignment making beats around the planet
When I serve to my advantage I'ma steal it single handed
And bring it back home so they know the ship has landed
Where it's deadly dilated any marathon I ran it
In the future better run it when I'm keeping shit one hundred
I only speak the truth so in the future ain't no fronting
The roof is on fire that we're sitting under blunted
Getting higher when it burning now we're turning up the oven
I give a fuck if the critics agree
I'm Rhymesayer number three under Slug & Ali
I'm dilated number three under Rakaa & Babu
Never outshine the masters, the rule before two

You're now rocking with the west
