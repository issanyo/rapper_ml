[Intro]
Ayo, grr
Flygod

[Verse]
Ayo, the scorpion, doors up, all red Delorean
Backin' up a moment, CJ snuck the forty in
Armani Emporio, I heard he Godbody, pushed the colon in
I know God got me duckin' autopsies
East Side Buffalo nigga, I'm a phenomenon
My shooters don't give two fucks, he sniff through Ramadan
Hit the scene up, eat [?], then call the fiends up (Skr)
Feds tryna interrogate, I caught amnesia
Shots repetition, I hid behind the Benz Wagon with Penn plates (Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot)
His brains up on the windshield
Flipped over an F-Pace and landed on a quarter mil'
Big [?] Porterville, blood call me, you know the deal
Crash the new Lexus (Skr), Fishscale German Suplex
Fuckin' R&B bitches, workin' on my duet
Make sure the pump can fit, get a 2K
I'm just the dopest, nigga
You fuck with me, you gotta smoke a nigga (Boom boom boom boom)
Boa Constrictor loafers, one shot, it be over with ya (Boom)
Learn from them over niggas

[Chorus]
I'm in the mess hall gettin' lessons
Before we walked the yard, God blessed it
Play the day room, lookin' extra
New G-Shock and the necklace (Ah)
New G-Shock and the necklace (Ah)
New G-Shock and the necklace (Ah)
New G-Shock and the necklace (Ah)
In the mess hall gettin' lessons
Before we walked the yard, God blessed it (Ah)
Play the day room, lookin' extra
New G-Shock and the necklace (Ah)
