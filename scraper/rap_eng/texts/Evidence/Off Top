[Verse One]
This is something I designed for the mind
And in the hood, you gotta be nice with the nine
Nine meaning nine numbers
I've been doing this here, let's get this clear
Serving you cats for nine summers
Freestyles can be the gift and the curse
As soon as I spit it, they bit it the worst
Everything I'm sayin' is real, I'm livin' a verse
Ever since 9/11 I've been livin' and lurkin'
Don't cross my path cause you don't want the outcome
By Any Means Necessary like the brother Malcolm
I really don't know where to begin
You gotta know the ins and outs before you get in
The most dedicated
And it's clearly stated
Most of my crimes have always been rhyme related
?? period dot spot
The best that ever did it that's naturally off top

[Scratch Hook]
"Shootin' at you, and that's off the top like Supernatural" - Big Pun 'New York Giants'
"I call it like I see it on stage like Supernatural" Dilated Peoples 'Heavy Rotation'
That's off top

[Verse Two]
See I'm a trooper man
I got a super plan
They left me in the cornfield like I was Super Man
But I ain't Super Man, it's just a Supernat
And half the cats now-a-days is super wack
Under pressure I was feelin' the heat
Took it back to basic, did some shit for the street
Spit for my life cause my son gotta eat
And it was once said that death was the cousin of sleep
So I stay on my grind till I'm plating my shine
I'm talkin' 2-4-7 and 3-6-5
What you know 'bout stayin' up late night?
Doin' it 20 times just to get the tape right
Valedictorian servin' you sophomores
Hold the mic in my right but you switch it to south paw
Keep my title in a 12 round bout
I be the real Supernatural so yo, check it out

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Spit fighter
Rhyme gladiator
I don't hate the game I hate the player hater
I know some super MC's and ill freestylers
That's vicious like Pits and lock like Rottweilers
I pop necks, I don't pop collars
Freestyle sold on my block for top dollar
Loved by thugs and street scholars
Remember the words of my dear old father
He said "Don't stop till you make it to the top"
G's up
"And that's off the top like Supernatural"
And to the ones that fake it that said I'd never make it
Freeze up
"And that's off the top like Supernatural"
Too much faking, killin' you counterfeiters
I roll with fly go-getters and large heavy hitters
This is all real, I'm never pretending
If you think this is the end, this is only the beginning

[Hook]
