[Hook 1: Rakaa]
You should check the signs, symbols, hits, clues
The writings on the wall but it's up to you

"What you wanna do is watch for clues"
You should check the signs, symbols, hits, clues
The writings on the wall but it's up to you
Expansion Team Dilated Peoples Crew
And If you still don't know, this is how we do

[Hook 2: Rakaa and (Evidence)]
There ain't nothing as bright (as heavy) as light
(as dark) as night (as set to strike)
As ready (as right) as loose (as tight) as quick to expand
As we on the mike

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
If it was a snake it would have bit ya'
Slithered up like a boa-consticta and griped ya'
Step back and beat the big picture
These cats as though in my head
I charge the mound just to get the picture
Bitch clearest specialist better hit ya'
But never miss ya'
Y'all need to double check the scripture
Deco, Deco, unload, reload
Pressin' heights Peco, live like Steve Beko
Piss on trees and leave marks to graffiti
Even gang graffiti though I'm for the peace treaty
Frustrated cats we hussle but still needy
And whistle like Twity when we see the LAPD
We going four for score for the prize
You need to see with more than your eyes
It's war in disguise
Tanfa callas are vagrants
This goes for every agent
Some are camouflaged others are very blatant

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Se keep your torch lit, light your flares, have back ups prepared
Wait for the enemy, war is declared
Expansion Team Theme music anthem
Got coloured schemes hot, peak lovers red at random
Up close and personal, songs from my journal
My lyrics are the ink, my reflection is eternal
These words are powerful, so hard to describe
Type to raise eye brows and open eyes
But what we did, get your hands dirty, fingers dusty
I've been around the world, you haven't, you could trust me
Line them up, knock them down
Keep them cocked, beats and vocals
If you fuck with these locals catch ghost busters logo
Channel zero
Separate suckers from heroes, recorded digital Bobby Deniro
Load your base bags, put on your gloves, lace the shoes
Keep your eyes open for signs and ears open for clues
