[Intro]
I’d do anything (anything)
Anything (anything)
Anything… niggas be out her hoein out

[Verse 1: BLU]
Oh yea, Rosa Perez, my bad I almost called you Rosa
Eyes feel, how that feel?
You said it wasn’t that ill the posers all over your poster
We post up for you, tell the show closer, shows over
It’s like an old soldier with no model for tomorrow
I be thinking bout upholding my bottle
Plottin on my Abe Lincoln, loading hollows with my hands on the Bible
Throw a peace though like I’m Middle Eastern
8 ink pins need revival, yo I’m non-religious
The palm is itching, put a psalm up in it, gave me when he thought I pull em different
Mama’s crib is safe, papa’s crib safe
All my brothers and sisters know the color of my nickel plate
Still the haters wanna ask me how I deal with hate
Told em you should never look a pistol in the face
You just go the extra mile just to make sure that you’re living it straight
You tell Barack I need a crib in estates
And cake niggas celebrate with your liquor no chase
Just to hit you quick or just to get yo face up out my face, fake nigga
How you picture tomorrow? With the wrong frame of mind
How you picture love if you are blind?
And the crowd trippin

[Hook x2: Reks]
You see I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There’s so much in the name, it’s so much more in you
My… make you my…
Ch'yea!

[Verse 2: Evidence]
It’s grab day to day but I’m good enough on a bad day
Runnin 'round my town without a sad face
Evidence make dough, moneys fat bills come realities back
No strikes back, no - strike that
I snap 'til I’m done with my picks 'til it’s sick
A pic’s only perfect as the person is fit
I lock a shot then I shoot to gift and focus in
In dark rooms I develop the prints
So place your bets on he with [?]
The flow is peace, the beat is stack, the light on the street is he
I’m the most west side of any west sider rider
Ridin out by the beach until the day is complete
I won’t stop, no [cano?] with the clock flow
I was a snot nose kid, I had the potholes
In my lawn, I was bombing from dust
And I grew the fuck up like I still dodge gestapos

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Reks]
Glass of champagne on a rosy carpet
The flow we sparked it like light to darkness, illuminating authors
Catch the itis upon Noah's Ark
40 days and 40 nights, arose to port, stars shining the brightest
Rhythm unite us, bring us closer to the roads chose
Wise as my nigga pimp, bow to the signs of blimp
Reading 'the world yours,' horderves et cetera
Treat her like a lady 'til ya cheddar up
Credible measures of competitors is laughable
I never was one, to see your efforts standing next to us
Had a few occasions on my exodus when rappers thought that Rekka
Was the type to be stymied by naysayers and hecklers
Heck of a rep, above the clouds, Inspectah Deck, I touch
Crowns with the intellect, probably there’s an introspect
Crown me king to the death, karma bring plenty deaths
Then he got with me with the Henny breath

[Hook x2]
