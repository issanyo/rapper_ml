{Evidence - ohh! Evidence - yeah, yeah yeah...}

"Ladies and gentlemen, without no further adieu
I'd like to introduce to you"

[Evidence]
The hottest though; lock'n'load
Brand new, Evidence, the people want, here you go
Back again, never left, street hop, no ref
Pack them in, capacity, maximum, no less
Attractin them; old folks askin him
Turn my music down - understand I'm passionate
Up late, no sleep, grind hard, go deep
What's meant to be will be, it's no accident
Years overdue, the solo comin soon
A world premier, face the moment of truth
Crash course, smart enough to understand percentages
Some put in work, never reaped any benefits
Both middle fingers up, pointed at the industry
Not yet, but when the cat's gone you'll be missin me
This my life, I hope you listenin
Windows down, system up, let's go, we makin history

[Hook: repeat 2X]
They say it's not my time but I keep on movin
Cause - I know, I know, I know
Though they don't see my mind it won't stop my movement
Cause - I know, I know, I know

[Evidence]
Here I go again {EV~!} On my own, same road ever known
Only child, wild pops, didn't cry, born alone
Twelve/ten/seven-six, flow heaven sent
One-nine-nine-oh, call him Evidence
To hear one rhyme and one line's flow
Call it medicine, never been the same ever since
I'm a man, got bills, dead Presidents
Coincidentally what I love pays rent
Coincidentally I'm on top of my game
The more I think, the more ink sinks to my pain
And it's a new day, so I expect the worst
Don't quite need a vest, still watch for strays
What's it come to, what else to say?
Shaq's a cop, and the Lakers ain't runnin L.A.?
Shit is crazy out there, they pullin 180's out there
I guess I'll never change my ways

[Hook]

[Evidence]
{EV~!} They'll never understand the flow
I know, I know, I know
And I don't need new friends, I keep the ones I know
(Yeah I know) I know, I know, I know (I know who my friends are)
And I heard around the way I can't make it on my own
(My own?) I know, I know, I know
(Let them talk, I know what they say)
But this is, all I got, all I breathe, all I know
I know, I know, I know (I don't know what else there is)

[DJ Revolution]
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"I didn't leave my group, it's just time we all expanded"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"The Weatherman lands, ready to drop shit"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"I didn't leave my group, it's just time we all expanded"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"The rain is on the way because the weatherman predict it"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"I didn't leave my group, it's just time we all expanded"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
{Evidence - ohh! Evidence - yeah} And that's me
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"
"I didn't leave my group, it's just time we all expanded"
"Go out on my own, somethin that I gotta do"

(I know, I know, I know)

[Evidence]
Yeah, as we procede
We lettin it all out
It's the Weatherman LP
Let's get into this shit
Spin that back
