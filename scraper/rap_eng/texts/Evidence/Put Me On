Cool as a summer breeze
Drifting on memory
She got me on my knee
But darlin' I'm begging, please
And if there's a winter storm
And I'm there to keep you warm
In whatever shape or form
Baby girl gotta put me on

(Mad Child)
It's been ten years runnin' and you still look stunnin'
One in a million, Diamond, you're beautiful with brilliance
Still it's not enough, even though we're inseparable
We need to take a break but that don't mean that I'll let you go
Tears become streams, we got the same dreams
What's with all the competition, Ma? We on the same team
Angel, sometimes I don't show it on the surface
But, your face is unreplacable, it's perfect, you're worth it
I'm not always there emotionally, even though you're close to me
I got work to do, that's how its supposed to be
And I ain't into choppin' it up
I'll switch your top but don't trip, got you a brand new whip
And took you shoppin', it's cool
Just do your thing while I work on this music shit
If we don't end up back together, though I'mma lose it, kid
I gotta spit viscously and throw bolts of thunder
For now be a stranger, but don't change your number

(CHORUS) (Everlast)
Cool as a summer breeze
Drifting on memory
She got me on my knee
But darlin' I'm begging, please
And if there's a winter storm
And I'm there to keep you warm
In whatever shape or form
Baby girl gotta put me on

Hey

(Everlast)
She's a hot one, ain't no one illa
Butter pecan and French vanilla
Shit, I'm speakin'- it's true word for realla'
Baby girl be like a stone killa'
She call me Papi and sometimes it's daddy
She lookin' proper, never look ratty
Her waist is small, her booty's real fatty
Might let her hold the keys to my caddy

(Prevail)
Of all the beautiful women that I've met in this world
Why's it such a challenge trying to find the right girl?
I've dated actresses, models, strippers, intellectuals
Four months max, like Maxim, it's all sexual
Incredible, I've been to more than twenty countries
Got dirty, ugly with hunnies that were lovely
But trust me, I'm a Scorpio
That's how it has to be
Till I'm chillin' with children and a house
I'm fast and free

(Moka Only)
Lookin' back through all the Springs that passed
The Summer time fun with no strings attached
I'll never find love and these flings don't last
Will there ever be a queen for this king to match?
Till then, I'll be...

(Chorus)x2 (Everlast)
Cool as a summer breeze
Drifting on memory
She got me on my knee
But darlin' I'm begging, please
And if there's a winter storm
And I'm there to keep you warm
In whatever shape or form
Baby girl gotta put me on

Baby girl put me on...
