*sample from The Matrix*

"Which is of course what is all about...
Evolution...evolution, like the dinosaur...
Look out that window; you had your time
The future is our world"

"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target" *cut up and repeated 3x*

[Evidence]
I be the first to tell you when it comes to drum
Turnin up your snare too loud wears out your welcome
I'm not trippin on cats who wanna jack my hats
I do the same, do solo on your shit, is open game
I never understood those who sold out for Benz
Some say I do too much, burn candles at both ends
But still I play the back, cuz when I don't do that, attacks
The fatter the cuts, the fatter the track
And fat tracks important as clear mics
Some are sureshots but most are prototypes
Post your snipes all over Babylon
You're too spaced out, sound requires air to travel on
Pack the bags, another mission to complete
But first I set my ground work here on the street
Do you like the way I vocalize?
Then bring it to a compromise
My DJ won't settle till noon, it's evolution

[Hook]
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target"
"Evolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn" [Iriscience]
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target"
"To evolve, please evolve with self respect" [Chuck D]
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target"
"Evolution is a cycle to turn, vital to learn"
"Evolution" "Is the day you're my target"
"To evolve, please evolve with self respect"

"Look to fuck some stuff up, and rip another rough cut"
"Evidence" [Canibus]
"And Revolution"
"Wha-what what" [Noreaga]

[Evidence]
I tell em all',Too many words in a verse don't sound fresh'
Instead...
"I slow flows ya'll to death" [Jay-Z]
And if you chillin where you are
Then don't complain on how you got there
"I get the paper so I don't care" [Milk D]
Too many play it close but ain't really on the team
US'd at twenty-six, Vietnam'd at nineteen
"Nineteen" *cut and scratched*
With my DJ like that, yo killin the one's and two's
Got no choice but to
"Grab the microphone and get loose" [Iriscience]
Ah, crews say my name, respect the street fame
Plus my tracks aim to
"Blow ya outta the frame" [OC]
And if you feel we done ya done wrong
You can seek restitution, then
"Spend three sixty degrees"
For evolution

Chorus

*DJ Revolution cuts*
