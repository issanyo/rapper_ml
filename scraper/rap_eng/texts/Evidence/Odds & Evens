[Intro]
Uh, from the top Cigar
Odds & Evens, this is for you
Pick any number, it's for you
Cause I beat the odds
And I'm gettin' even
Yeah, I hope you enjoyin' this album
Yeah, I hope you doin' what you do best
And I hope you bangin' your motherfuckin' head right now

[Defari]
Roll yours windows up
Take a ride in a 65 degree Q4-5
Blowin' green stuff, bumpin' mean stuff
Mindin' my own, these squares don't mean much
I'm on Adams, I want some J & J's
Home fries, turkey, sausage, grits, and eggs
A lemonade, now I'm good for the day
Got rehearsal at 12:00, gotta bring top shelf
So, you know I'm faded when I'm at work
You've been to the shows, that's my best work
Alkaholik pro's - network
Los veteranos, experts
This style's crazy, make your chest hurt
Weak hearts feel a spark from the pepper
I spit like a man that you've never heard
So if you hear this style again, must be a mockingbird
And you know birds could never ever fuck with lions
It's a small thing to a lyrical giant
Killa California Golden Bear
Spank Air's, new wear's at the best affairs

[Hook]
I don't care where you come from
(It don't change)
I spit wit a ill tongue
(Full blown)
Rhymes hit ya like stun guns
Rest in peace Jeff, Will, and Rob One
I don't care where you come from
(It don't change)
I spit wit a ill tongue
(Full blown)
Rhymes hit ya like stun guns
Odds & Evens, what the deal nigga?
Pop somethin'

[Defari]
I always filter out the weakness
My Triple Crown sound won a Preakness
The Belmont and Kentucky Derby
And all the rich chicks in the bleachers
I stay clean cause I'm L.A
Puttin' creases in my pants since first grade
Had to wash mom's car every Saturday
Clean your room, vacuum, throw the trash away
Young killers runnin' wild like they go no mom
Ain't if they do their mom must got some problems
And if she don't, then why all the ghetto violence?
The kids be involved and other brothas dyin'
So me, I just observe with cool silence
Fools play victim to a mighty lion
Play Roulette, pick red or black
Odds & Evens, any number, pick a bangin' track
Defari bounce back, shit that nigga never left
Evidence proves, what I want I can get

[Hook]
I don't care where you come from
(It don't change)
I spit wit a ill tongue
(Full blown)
Rhymes hit ya like stun guns
Rest in peace Bigga B and Rob One
I don't care where you come from
(It don't change)
I spit wit a ill tongue
(Full blown)
Rhymes hit ya like stun guns
Odds & Evens, what the deal nigga?
Pop somethin'
