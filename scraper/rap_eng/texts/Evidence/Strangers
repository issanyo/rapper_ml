[Verse 1]
If it's one thing I've learned that I've written down on paper
It's never leave some weed on the table with a stranger
Shit, I could barely even trust my friends
Maybe with my lady, not trees of the mends
I mean really why even should I try and test it socially
Catch em in the act and end up having to approach them
Entertain the story while it's testing on my patience
Why the fuck you think I spent this money on surveillance
While I'm on the other side of Earth without assistance
Hitching in the night saying Evi goes the distance
At home the same shit is going on, I don't miss it
It's a nice place to live, but I wouldn't wanna visit
Never stepping out the car or on the stage without a purpose
Ghost-ride the whip like I'm ghost writing verses
Afraid to come and go so I take fame in little doses
Director of these photos so the aim remains focused
Hold still right there, hold still

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
I ain't holier than thou or trying to even act superior
Half the shit I rap about I'm speaking from experience
I'm living at the beach, about as west as the Earth goes
People get deceived, seeing gangsters dressed in surf clothes
From ? where they birthing those flows to set the world off
On a wet park bench drinking OJ and Smirnof
I seen it through my own three and speak it how I heard it
Never tell it how it wasn't not only pen that murder
I been touring constantly
So there's wear and tear value
That merits all the lows to terrace highs and travel
Document this madness till the day I come unraveled
And retreat to the matterhorn, basking in the castle
On some Dennis Leary Asshole, fuck you pay me shit
I've come too far to get jacked and you can weight of it
So right about now I think it's bout that time
That I'mma let Rev kill while I chill on the rhyme
What the fuck

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I ain't speaking on my businesses in public when concerning deals
Stepping on stage like it's light bulbs or turning wheels
In spite a couple nights of a thousand I didn't kill
I still kept it peeling out and stepping up for Reverend Real
Messages across the board are still remaining pinned up
The opposite of dilated eyes that I begin with
Nothing is original
Even under cloudy days sun is still shining
Just rerouted and out of phase
Lately when I walk I've been trying to hold my posture straight
Hold my chin up then feel the love from across the way
California love from Diego to across the Bay
All across the map to every single solitary state
All across the baggage claim
All across the gate
Some calling it freight how I'm carrying weight
Some calling it fate while some others remain torn
Some calling it rain cause that's when I brainstorm
