KeyKool (of Visionaries):
Breakin' it down to the double Helix
Genetically mutated amino acid trips
Now you're in the groove like styluses (record needles)
Cause I'm fuckin' up the program like computer viruses
Rhyme piloted
By the lyrical trinity
With the Key Evidence to support Divinity
Some will see
Falsely but never hear
So I back my fact with more proof to make it Everclear
For you to view right through the bull when you hear it you know the spirtual Alliance
Rhyme defiance with appliance of science
To kill compliance and the agency
That wanna take my will to fight and make me numb
Like tryin' to mack at a convent they won't get nun (none)
One for all, all for one coexistence
Infinite Omnipotence

LMNO (of Visionaries) Hook:
Existence everywhere at the same time
Physically separated synchronized minds
Street, studio, stages online
All is possible with
"All seein' retina" -Divine Styler

Evidence (of Dilated Peoples):
I never fall behind I'm rushed ahead
I got the metronome clique inside my head
Scoped it out peeped out most of my town
Most songs got wack mixes they call the underground
Gotta express the feelings
I ain't havin' it
Like Pos K jibbin' to Lyte thinkin' of stabbin' it
Skills prevail oh you possess take no offense
But don't profess live up in your mind attempted stress
Factors leading to other illness
My crew Groups at my Home creatin' tracks the the Realness
Is combinations like this
Divine Styler, Key Kool yo the one Evidence
The influence is on, that question they never miss
For innovative lyrics check crisp cadence Parrish Smith
Are you feelin' me?
Raise your hands if you can get with three
Cats bringin' back Roy Ayers type Ubiquity

Hook

Divine Styler:
Presence everywhere exist ubiquity feelin' me
Earth Wind & Fire Water desire
Bring forth manifest dues create schools and rhyme tools
My eye force so rules so periodic measures move
Space and air
I appear to be clear
But reflect when the heat hits your shadows of fear (stratosphere)
Your into pieces my mic a fiendin' your thesis
You're just a part of me so pardon me ubiquity
Is flippin' me
I'm teachin' me beyond the furthest reaches
Soul control memoirs of wars and battles scars from lords
The reward when I battle stars and self excel war for control
I ubiquitize and solidify the rhyme into a world that one mind
Either one non material a time for the two
With the harmonious rules
Ubiquity is we and I creatin' rhyme history
Through the powerful and wise

Hook
