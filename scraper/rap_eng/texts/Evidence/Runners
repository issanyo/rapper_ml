My fist or this pistol nose
Tip on your grill so quick you'll be missing those
Pearly whites I take early flights
Here's some advice: quit ya fuckery
Is it Lacoste or a Polo night?
Man that's cool yous a boss, I'm a prototype
Solamente wordsmith touch la gente
Bars for so many I'm an honorary sensei

[Evidence]
Things I never thought about
Trying to be elusive and the process get forgot about
No doubt I don't think about it, write it down
Look what you made me do (the birds flew)
On my side of town I'm known to be truth
Got the right light inside of the booth
I see it all like a view from the roof
Gray and gray are both acceptable off liquor I'm loose
They clocking me but I don't watch what replicas do

[Defari]
There's so much evidence that we set a precedence
For Southern California residents
I give you this inheritance of
Real rap jewels in the form of amphetamines

[Evidence]
What's the difference from take-out and delivery? (what?)
Serve 'em at the spot or we bring it to them literally (yup)
And it'll be a cold day in hell
If you hear about the evidence that Everett fell

[Defari]
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we

[Evidence]
Who wanna see a RSE emcee?
E to the V, off the mast a leaf in the tree
All you gotta do is give Evie a chance
And I'm gonna light my plants

[Defari]
Things I always thought about
Trying to get my kids everything that they thought about
I'm advance man I'm running routes (with runners)
NFL scouts talk about
Proverbial I'm Nazareth
Black Jesus with words for infidels and hazardous
Individuals who underestimate Los Angeles
Savages hear to take away your advantages

[Evidence]
I put my heart in everything I spit for analysts
Still Los Angeles with candles lit and cannabis
Where I'm at, what I'm doing
Left off the old rocks and old ruins
The wait is over influence
Never knew it going off stupid biz music
My greatest shit is my latest shit, go 'head and loop it
Still make a killing for an underground rapper
Water flows runny like nose of coke trappers

[Defari]
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we
Fade one, fade two, fade three
No matter how many tell 'em come see we
