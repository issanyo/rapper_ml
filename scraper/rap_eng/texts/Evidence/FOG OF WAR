VERSE1 Circuit

Enter, my center, feel the volcanic presence
And the pressure of the magma that's crept in upon this rapper
See my eyes, you can see pain, an Angels demise
Use it to fuel the life, an energizer of types
My name is Circuit, shockin a spine with tenebrous verses
I, spin in, cyclin through the spleen, what I breathe is vitamins
And hydrogen, light up with vocabulary, I exist
As a rifleman, scope out words to bring you enlightenment
Slight leviathan, shock your vitals and bring the silence in
My ēthērēal realm, you'll pass through life/death experience
Symphonic mutagens to allude upon a new period
A myriad of paper to bait you in with my lines
I'm the lord of flies, unshackle this beast upon the rhymes
I find it soothing, everything that tortures souls for blooming
You can look inside my mind, see all that I had devised
My surroundings, feathers, ink stains, and paper to crown me

HOOK

Yo, we all set in
War path, we form
That villainous bomb track
To knock back your doors
With Circuit & Jay2Slik
Oracles aim swiftly
That murderous duo
To circulate hell with the deadly

VERSE2 Jay 2 Slik

I speak and summon the beast unleashed out my vocal cords
Holy souls get trapped in infinite space when i close the doors
Behold the force that puts you in a trance when i shock the place
Cuz what I write will melt your mind like getting drenched in toxic waste
My saliva is hazardous like corrosive acids
Unload my passion on the mic till it explodes to ashes
The rhyme is sorcery i was born a demonic freak
You'll need some liquid nitrogen to put away my body heat
Rehearsing verses in latin engraved in hatching shells
From the depths of avalon casting authentic magic spells
My flesh is prominent gaurded by hectic guardians
Selective audience worship me like respected monuments
Im soon to be globally recognized a phenomenon
Im gonna be as large as the radius of andromeda
Sitting by sinful savages in the kingdom of dark abyss
Lighting villages on fire like an arsonist

HOOK

Yo, we all set in
War path, we form
That villainous bomb track
To knock back your doors
With Circuit & Jay2Slik
Oracles aim swiftly
That murderous duo
To circulate hell with the deadly

VERSE3 Circuit

Yo i take a crack at the ruler
Rapper to school ya
The minds a computer
Im from the future where the famine is felt
So fall back
Finna damage ya cells on contact...
Feel the ravenous spells that contract
Muscle spasms, ya ailed
This combat
Puttin fog to the war
The slaughter before the calm
Better follow its course
I gotta
Capture the scene
A miraculous fiend
I fracture the dreams
Of wack rappers
Back in their sleep

VERSE4 Jay 2 Slik

Your bound to retreat im immaculate treacherous since my first sample
The growl of the murderous beast is cracking the earths mantle
These rappers get crushed into particles by my arsenal
Demon controlling the mic so dont hold me responsible
Multiple personalities my identitys broken
Im so cold im technically cryogenically frozen
Fire energy motion like bowser from my esophagus
Ama just crack a smile while im burning down your metropolis
