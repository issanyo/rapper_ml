I be trippin'   (I be trippin')
You be trippin' (you be trippin')
He be trippin'  (he be trippin')
She be trippin' (people trip)

There's different forms of intoxication
Like tryin' to find that radio station
I guess I'm a dope fiend for this music
For those that knows D, knows I do's it
I've rocked with O.G.'s and youths that does it
I've really done more than what ya used to cousin
I've got more in common with dudes in the streets
That's why I steady be droppin' bombs on these weirdos and geeks
I'm like - Coca-Cola while these lame dudes are off-brand
I'm like marble while these lame dudes are soft sand
Firm ground, that's most important
Just touched LAX, had a gig in Portland
I hit hard like Ali hit Foreman
I make U-C LA like the great Ken Norton
Mr. Bill Smokey Robinson - I'm a miracle
And just like him I get paid for my lyrical

I be trippin'   (I be trippin')

There's different levels of buzz and high
Some people feel nice, some feel they can fly
Some folks are assholes without a bad day
Some folks will blast you's for bein' in the way
My soliloquy's an essay about bullshit
How the earth keep spinnin', why fools trip
How Defari's known to trip, not over a chick
Swipe game up to par, I'm grown with my dick
I'm like - Magic when I play, I see the court
If rap is a sport, then I'm like Jim Thorpe
Or - Jack LaLanne, The Great Duane
Relinquish my passport before boarding a plane
I've thought, how much spittery is my brain?
How many times can I demonstrate pleasure and pain?
How many rude motherfuckers wanna ask for change?
What can I say, people trip, everyday all day
