[Chorus]
Rain drops fallin’ on my window…sill…sill…sill
Rain drops fallin’ on my window…still…still…still
Rain drops fallin’ on my window

[Verse 1]
The memories fall
Cats and Dogs—memories, y’all
Fallin’ down the pen or recall
Rain drops fallin’ on my head like a flashback
Guns in the rose, Axl and Slash back
Wet checks, BMI’s, ASCAP’s
My rainy day money and made it past that
Another day to push ‘cause the night is long
And went through writer’s block just to write a song
To left right but don’t right a wrong
I can see clearly now the rain is here
The pain is here, and I stayed sincere
All to say it’s the work in a day
And I’m all in my words that I word in a way

[Chorus]
When the rain drops fallin’ on my window…sill…sill…sill
Rain drops fallin’ on my window…still…still…still
Rain drops fallin’ on my window

[Verse 2]
We could call it water under bridges
Or we could not, it’s all in one decision
See the pyramids or see the prison
Keys open doors but the doors are off the hinges
How many got a friend that ain’t suspicious?
Heard before Nas that it was written
Got a lot but got a lot of livin’
Missed the last call, it’s passin’ the bar
Thinkin’ ‘bout the past as I pass in my car
All to say it’s the work in a day
And I’m all in my words that I word in a way

[Chorus]
When the rain drops fallin’ on my window…sill…sill…sill
Rain drops fallin’ on my window…still…still…still
Rain drops fallin’ on my window…sill
