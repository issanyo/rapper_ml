Well, ladies and gentlemen, whoever said it doesn't rain in Southern California was surely mistaken. Flash flood warning is still in effect, and all beaches are closed. Homes along the coast have been evacuated, from Palos Verdes to Oxnard, and [?] is closed as well. However, we've got some good news. Our radars indicate that we will see the sun poking through the clouds as early as tomorrow morning. I do hope, if you're visiting the Greater Los Angeles area this week, you still managed to have a good time. Stay tuned as always for dependable weather updates from your friend Cap.
