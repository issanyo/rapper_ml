Yeah
I'ma need to succeed so I bleed on papyrus
Used to sleep with a Swede, you would think she was Linus
When she squeezed like I'm a security blanket at night
It's like "Please, let me breathe" but she think she your highness
And she thinks she's the finest I mean - she is fly
But when it comes to my rhymin, and comes to my grindin
I got crowns to get like Harry Potter
Flyin broomsticks, when he found the snitch
Bitch, see time will tell
When I'm struttin through this concrete jungle with a lion's tail
Cain't nobody stop me from pursuin my dreams
And haters negativity just motivates the team
Tellin girls real shit, they'd rather I lie to 'em
Cause it's not what they wanna hear gotta say goodbye to 'em
It's my rhythm; I move to the beat of my own drum
The semi-auto pop and lock like Rerun
Wash my face with the apricot scrub
Like a bearskin, rap nigga face on my rug
Wipe my feet on it, some random hot chick
In the place that I hug, she probably just tasted my cum
I'm just a bachelor, been told I'm kinda moody
Fuck it, I'm a Libra, don't like it baby then sue me
This is not a romantic comedy, life is not that movie
It's more like Color Purple, family members desert you
Racism will hurt you, hot women will flirt too
But fuck with the right nigga he will murk you
All I need is one mic, one Mac, one iPhone
Just one shot in this one life then I'm gone
I spit that - love me or leave me alone
That's exactly how I feel, I'm only bein real
Cause I was destined to do great things
Blackjack like ace king, self-actualized since eighteen

[Evidence]
Yo, uhh, yo
Raised by QD3, we seen the years of menace
They can't evict a landlord, I proceed over the tenant
I mostly co-sign, get my pen out in minutes
Six minutes 'til showtime, overseas with Al The Chemist
E to the V, my life like I seen the most
Afraid to go see P., like they seen a ghost
"Follow the Leader" though, track record ratio
Blue sky, look into the heaven, try to stay below
The flow bricked up raw but packaged eloquent
Stubborn as a bull, still the memory is elephant
Never forget a friend, that's veteran etiquette
I'm possibly better than but never let it get
Anywhere near the here, the end of my last chapter
My first one was mapped up
Some format close but no two identical, that's a replica
+Weathermen+ and cats and dogs, the flow is chemical
Lord have mercy, not every verse is skin deep
But inspiration's up, not every new leak has been weak
Hoped for the best and knew the worst when it cursed me
Been searchin for my soul, the second you but not the first me
My people gotta eat and worse when we thirsty
The wolves smell the blood, didn't find us but they searchin
So on that note, I coulda chose crime but chosen to rhyme
Evidence with Ras-sy, it's such a beautiful grind

[Outro]
SHUT UP!!! 50 years ago we'd have had you
Upside down with a fucking fork up your ass
{*laughter and shock*}
You can talk, you can talk, you can talk!
You're brave now motherfuckker!
Throw his ass out. He's a nigga! He's a nigga!!!
He's a nigga!!! (Oh my God)
A nigga, look, there's a nigga!
Oooooooooh
