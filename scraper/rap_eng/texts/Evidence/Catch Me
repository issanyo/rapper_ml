[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC
Vitamin like GNC
Can't see me like B-I-G, on C-M-T
Then a little bit of time on B-M-G
But this right here homie, this all me
Can you be down?
Naw, C-M-B
That's cold that ain't ice G
So what though?
Little homie remind me of Ice-T
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimpin is easy
So catch me I'm ballin
I'm sick two of you?
Catch me like coughing back when I said you should catch me like Spaldings
It's cool cause most cats I bump into can't catch me that often
Most times they just end up fallin
Ball for a few then end up walkin
Catch me in the ball when a cinderella Waltzing
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive
Might go once, might go twice
But never three times like I auctioned to it
See I, walk into it, I do my thang
Then tell the owner that it's cool to let y'all into it

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC
Vitamin like GNC
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
A.B.B. to A.L.C
Man, we stay on the J.O.B

[Verse 2: Evidence]
We on some, E.V. to the T.O.P
Did a little bit of time on C.A.P
But this right here dawg, there is no fee
To gettin' down, if I don't really feel your steez
See, I never trust 'em, catch me I'm ballin'
Taylor made custom, must be I'm all in
Still wanted like Worst Come To Worst
To the point where I never call myself O.G
I end games, never go O.T
And if so, Time's Up like O.C
And if not, then it wasn't my calling
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spalding
Rest in peace to my {edited}
Cali gold rush is here, we never staling
If all goes down, we still get fouled
Understand man, that's how it's supposed to be

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco]
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
If he indeed the MC
Vitamin like GNC
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me I'm ballin
Catch me like Spalding
Catch me like Spaldings
A.B.B. to A.L.C
Man, we stay on the J.O.B
