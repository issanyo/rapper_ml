[Intro: Billy Woods]
Yeah, it ain't
It ain't no free rides, man

[Verse 1: Billy Woods]
For all my pretension, still mix up tenses
Thought I was pensive, til' you seen the light on the pen tip
Hypertensive
This thing of ours, it's no pensions
Jay said "I'm bout a dollar, what the fuck's this 50 cent shit?"
Shakespearean vengeance
Rest assured, there's curtains at the ending
Don't talk about love, love that shit expensive
You don't know what it cost just to keep the friendship
HBO original print hanging near the entrance
Foyer, if you prefer
Freight paid by ghosts sittin' top those benches
Died deep in the trenches, they got stripes and tin metals
You chuckle but time turned many a pot to a kettle
Regardless, kept the balance in a ledger
Fuck a stash, life and death top drawer of the dresser
Everybody gots to go, but yo no pressure
Took the lectern at the lecture
Half open for Malcolm at the Autobahn but nobody made the effort
Modern day christ waitin' for the Romans every night
They never came, worked a 9-to-5 his whole life
Died once, feeling cheated
Couldn't put his finger on it
Operation stack cola over the chronic
Just my two cents, pay no mind, it costs you nothing
But maybe you gotta come outta pocket to appreciate something
The numbers wasn't what you expected to see, huh?
Sometimes it's C.O.D
Sometimes you pay years later in ways you never even dreamed

[Verse 2: Mach-Hommy]
My nigga don't sleep
You already asleep
I'mma dream a little dream
I'mma put it in a pixel, make it hologram flame
I'mma little bit convinced them niggas all in bad shape
What's the benefit to haulin' dead weight?
Ain't no goofy ass waitin' on no label, nigga
All of that's straight
Niggas fallin' back way
All the way in the boonies
Ain't no honor in avoidin' man's fate
Neighbors drawin' mad drapes
High noon, high as hell
[?] rather call a cab [?]
Can't afford to half-bake
Cause if my Honda collide with a wraith it'll probably turn my daughter hair gray
How come all the cash beige?
Blas√©, other side of my mind is wishing karma had legs
Make a spoiled brat pay
For the sins of the father
Good kids getting lined up like the barber had space
Nigga marble that cake
Bandaid ain't doing nada for a autograph blade
Fast-paced, disinfectant spray in his cat's cage
Watch the heffers hate
Then it's hash haze, half-baked
That's great, halfway
I never thought I was headed that way
Backpay for all the cotton and sugar and all the--
Tobacco and all the--
All the way, cats wait, crash wave, cas-wait-crash waves
