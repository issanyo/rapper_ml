[Refrain]
I spent my life making bad luck in the good times
Looking back where I was taking the good things with the bad
For all I've lost, seen this far make me realize I have
I wanna live my days in vain but very far make me smile again
Seems like a natural thing to do, just remember

[Verse 1]
Steady on my mind
Bad luck, good times
For me it happens in the morning when I’m waiting for lights
I start thinking if he wrote my script different
Pictures with the brush lets spray in this missed our existence
Never gone as far to say I wished on a star
But I could say I wished for a car
Simple traits of us, people thinking too small
Now I realize the blink of an eye, the medicine sink in us all
Sink a swim till the season is fall, then it’s gone to November
But remember that December will call
Permanent, not as long as some might think
Last week I cleaned up some permanent ink
Oh, I’m on the verge of a break
There’s something new before the sky might fall and earth sinks
I sat down and played the cards I’m dealt
Some good, some bad, and still the message was felt
These are good times

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh it was 20/20 vision then, before the catch you and closed
The audience was listening
Oh that’s the purpose of reflecting
The purpose of a wordsmith's pen bleeding ink till my sketches permanent
I put the madness to the method
Round the same time Common dropped the Resurrection classic
I was still tripping off tabs of bad acid
Dreaming about my own rap disc in plastic
Selling demos back then became a lonely trail
Always got denied by the homie with the pony tail
Chalk that one up as that's part of the game, right
Looking back I'd do that shit the same
The same time my mom was leaving my pops
Was around the same time Neil Diamond sang Love on the Rocks
Make yourself a good day cause no one will do this besides yourself
Think about those words
Each time when you’re about to lose a good time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You never know, you never know, you never know
Good times is how I’m living it up
With my glass half full is how I’m viewing the cup
It went from when it's over to holding on a four leaf clover
Trying to find lady luck, where she at
I'm stuck, seeing birds eye from 6'2"
So I keep getting high, trying to lift my view
It’s funny how gotta pay bills can build the fan base
I love the road but ain't losing my land and that's damn straight
I make a plan and at least one I set a day
I'm not quite ike but still draw from my anime
I keep it moving and I plan to stay til the camera pans away
These are good times, I walk the street with a bye
And everything I did in the name of that high
Whether I flopped or I sold a million
Got booed at every single solitary hand up towards the ceiling
These are good times

[Hook]
