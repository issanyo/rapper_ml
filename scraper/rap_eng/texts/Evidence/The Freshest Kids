[Verse One] [Brother Ali]:
It's the Ak in the flesh of course I'm fresh
Caught wreck off my rep for givin' more for less
Marvelous
Highly regarded architect
Always offering the offerings that y'all respect
Swim all through the cesspool that sharks infest
Unmarked except for the mark of success
We harder than the hardest y'all can get
The beat just beatin' like a heart in your chest
We bomb your address to relieve all your stress
Hit pause reset, get lost in the set
All y'all reflect, let your thoughts progress
And drop your guard to the floor and get caught in my net
Gotta confess this is all I possess
Until I'm called by death I'll always be this
So what y'all expect, I'm supposed to fess?
Motherfucker don't hold your breath
Oh yes!

[Chorus] [Brother Ali]:
You're now rockin' with the best there is
Rhymesayers in the house we the freshest kids
Ali, Toki Wright and Evidence
BK let the record spin, tell 'em again
"Fresh"
Put it up {x6}
Toki Wright
What up?
I salute you
I salute you
Get on the mic and let it do what it do

[Verse Two] [Toki Wright]:
Inglorious Bastards, enjoyin' this action
Make audiences backspin
Kick like a .44 magnum
Rip like a Trojan Magnum package
I'm askin', "Who's ready to hear rappin' above average?"
Nope
I ain't Corleone but I can hold my own
Keep my soul even though I'm pro like Moses Malone
Mr. Wright is like kryptonite for those that bite
And life is like a gamble, one example, roll the dice
Ebola striking, get black balled on back blocks
Where black gals get called broads that cross black cat calls
Raw
Raw as Veganism, raw as Hedonism
Raw as civil war and genocide that leaves a victim
So lock your doors shut your windows tight
We hit hard like a right from Kimbo Slice to end yo' night
Plus we brought all the right elements
BK, Ali, Toki, Evidence

[Chorus] [Brother Ali]:
You're now rockin' with the best there is
Rhymesayers in the house we the freshest kids
Ali, Toki Wright and Evidence
BK let the record spin, tell 'em again
"Fresh"
Put it up {x6}
Evidence
What up?
I salute you
I salute you
Get on the mic and let it do what it do

[Verse Three] [Evidence]:
It's a new flow
Super duper Star like Group Home
Vietnam as 19, tellin' mama dukes so
26 soldiers, 25 over
21, 1 underage isn't any fun
I've been through many months of rainy days
Collecting pennies, adding up nowadays in a haze
When I wrote this
Excuse me, Jimmy played Purple Haze
Told him I would quote this, seen it from a distance
Speaking third person, don't wanna get specific
I guess the ticket of the price that I'm livin'
The mirror lied, I'm the nicest
I said, "Mirror I'm dope", it said, "Ev you priceless."
We're the best at when I snap, got the flow down pat
It's a wrap, I'm back, to claim what's rightfully mine
I'm on my grind, it's a sign of the time
I ain't changin' my guard I ain't changin' my mind
It's risky, 50 shows in 60 nights
E.V., Ali, BK, Toki Wright
Guest here, it's the Fresh Air Tour for life
In a fresh pair bless the mic

[Chorus] [Brother Ali]:
You're now rockin' with the best there is
Rhymesayers in the house we the freshest kids
Ali, Toki Wright and Evidence
BK let the record spin, tell 'em again
"Fresh"
Put it up {x6}
