[Moka Only, Mad Child, and Prevail together]
Who else you think this is? It's just us
I don't wanna tell you again so just trust
Who make the moves, makin the bucks and bring the heat
So bake that it's shakin your truck?

[Mad Child]
(Let it go) Back up in it, you cats are timid
Mad got the axe and the track is spinnin'
Cadillac, black and tinted, freak occurrence
Little rim caps swim laps in the rap occurrent
(This is it) I flow with heroic poets
My influence will ruin what you're doin'
I'm flowin'
The tyrant's back, I'm quiet as a riot is -
My mind's a violent environment
Bangin' anger bang us, it's awfully graphic
Catastrophic topics for target practice
Reestablish the elaborate labyrinth of havoc that's unmatched
The dukes of hazard
Fifty grand on each hand, man
Got people movin' like American Bandstand
Bang! Bang! My whole crowd's rowdy
Nine hundred thousand pals styles arousin'

Who else you think this is? It's just us
I don't wanna tell you again so just trust
Who make the moves, makin the bucks and bring the heat
So bake that it's shakin your truck?

[Moka Only]
I'm back with the title, it's mega hits
Cuz I got my shit together like Lego bricks
I'm never half-assin', I'm grabbin' the cash
My rap's happen, it's natural I'm laughin' to rap
Cannon ball through the back of your shack
Santa Monica to Panama, I'm smashin' the gas
In the fast car, NASCAR, hats to the back
I ain't tryin' to take ____(?), what else do that?
I'm not concerned with what you do
Fuck all that regular shit, I'm too cuckoo
Anything I want it, I snatch it and jet
As the type for destruction we smashin' that shit
I got license, who's the nicest?
Know the men from the mices (?)
Give me 10 fuck what the price is
Stretch that Benz, we set them trends
With my partners, so Ma you better get them friends

Swollen make her shake what she got. Ain't know them
Better to make the heat hot
Come and get some of this heat that we got
Gotta get off the wall and make the beat drop
Swollen make her shake what she got. Ain't know them
Better to make the heat hot
Come and get some of the heat that we got
Gotta get off the wall and make the beat drop

[Prevail]
Deep waters and torrential rain
The essential potentials of a hurricane
Natural disasters, smash and bang
I've got an overhauled engine and a faster frame
I don't lose races, so wave the checkered
Final lap, Battle Axe, play the record
I'm kickin' it to chicks, you're kickin' rockers
Hungry pack of wolves lickin' their chops
We're the same in this game, except that we won't stop
Which is insane when you think about how much we want
My train of thought is runaway with no conductor;
My verse is a box-cutter, stuck in your gut sucker
"All Killer No Filler" like Sum 41
Where I'm from, where I'm at, livin' life in the sun
We make no apologies, take no prisoners
Lyrics of fury, rippin' for the listener

Shake what she got, make the heat hot, shake what we
Got, make the beat drop
Swollen make her shake what she got, ain't know 'em
Better to make the heat hot
Come and get some of this heat that we got
Got get off the wall and we make the beat drop
