Yo emergency
"...emergency" "...emergency"
"...emergency" "...emergency"
First up

[Evidence]
Mighty Mi supplied the beat down
These raps are rent paid, four months before I leave town
Cat, we got the hottest shit that ain't been heard yet
To most I'm unknown, but to few; a war vet
I turn checks to cash, but no cash for checks
I never paid for sex, I pay girls to leave after sex
(Get the fuck out..) Play my cassanette then jet
I'm out for blood this year, flows are fangs of death
Specialize in fresh, M.D. veteran vest
There's so much to prove, you lose scoreless
Take Lex, Benz, Beam, convertable 'Vette's
Cribs and credit cards, payment plans in debt (Gimme that)

[Hook]
We present emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

[Evidence]
Yo dangerous connections, friends are kept seperate
Enemies drive 'em off the road, rev the engine
Levels of suspense, more this year no doubt
The card that you pull, always leave yourself with outs..
Stick to ya guns, stick to ya plans
Stick and hit when ya land, witcha fist and hit a man (boink)
The name of my crew; Dilated Expand
Babu, Iriscience, and myself in Japan
We got international flows
Under the best sign, rockin zodiac clothes
The strong survive in water where sharks are swimmin
Emergency, call the paramedics, lights are dimmin

[Hook]
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

Emergency, DJ Mighty Mi
Evidence by the mic "emer..emergency"
Watch out! "..mer..mer..emergency..emergency"
"This is an emergency"

[Evidence]
So check it out
The calm before the storm came
After that, 40 nights and 40 days of rain
Your weakest link, it's your crew, it stink
Numb ya brain, unpredictable patterns, and unpredictable pain
Got attack on hard, raise the game
Right now there's Columbian cats that's raisin 'caine
Los Angeles Lakers dynasty, change the game
Say, Defari and Phil y'all, let's clear the land
That's right, shit's outta control
Do rap music you perform to rock-n-roll
Got lyrics cocked back on trigger ready to pull it
I hitchu like the JFK mystery bullet

[Hook]
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)
Yo emergency, emergency, feel the pressure
No way out, situation gettin closer (emergency)
Time is tickin, walls are closin
Options narrow now, your the one that's chosen (emergency)

Yo emergency, emergency...
