[Verse 1: The Alchemist]
Everyday I wake up to the sound of waves crashing
Make moves it time to take action
More bread for the basket
No sleep, I do that when I'm the casket
No patience, I take no breaks and no vacation
I can't wait, time is money
Shine like California skies dead sunny after the rain
When it's all said and done make sure they remember my name
Level headed, hop off a G4 jet get on a train
Jump out a taxi cab and jump on the stage
No flash, never do shows for no cash
Checks come in my government name
But Chemistry man is what I'm known as
(Of course) you already know that
Hit up the city, hit my man up on the jack
Like "Where the smoke at?" (inhales)
My mind is free, no cage, center stage when it's time to speak
Drama settle nobody better, I stand next to the man that tells the weather
Like Goldie with the red leather I'm checking my cheddar

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Grammy family wildin' out, where the media flocks
To me it's a night at home, another pizza box
Another verse of cursing, trying to connect the dots
Just to hop, skip, and jump, the peddling never stop
Turn on my inbox, bills in my mailbox
As long as the beat knocks, I feel no stress
No chance to second guess, a feeling like this
No day I live twice, Venice still in the west
Spend six months out the year on my hustle and grind
The other half spent plotting whats next
Doubling time, ALC collaboration
Congratulations, I'mma bubble and shine
Starting the day with pardon, I'mma part this stage
I hope you're part at my side, when I drop this way
Eight point eight, shake shit up inside nature
LA's unstable, still chasing paper, crazy

[Scratches]
So Fresh

It's raining here in Houston and it's delayed a bunch of those earlier flights
I was gonna try to get on one of those, but that one was delayed
Longer than the one that I got now, so I got three hours to kill
I think I might go found some place to eat some wings and to hang out
And maybe watch Sportscenter.
