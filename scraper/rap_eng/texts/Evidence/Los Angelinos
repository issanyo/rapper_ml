[Intro: Defari Talking]
Yeah this for all my inner towners
My Los Angelinos
From Pico to Rosecrans
From Lincoln to Crenshaw
From Crenshaw to Main
Uh Huh

Municipal, What (it's the city)

L.A

[Verse 1: Defari]
Call all the women and all the kings men
The Jewel of Los Angeles is back again
DEFARI
Colder than Ice, hittin like dice
That are fixed, the cold trick pulled in front of your eyes
I'm goin Back to back back
Kobe and Shaq
Catch me flying down Pico with a Laker Flag
While every squares all U.S.A
I'm all L.A
Black and Brown town get down with Nig's & Eses (S.A's)
And white boys downer than most niggas
Especially when it come to hustling hard for these figures
L.A
Where the sun shine every day its all good
Sticky ass loads and haircuts in Inglewood
Classics sittin on rallies or D's
Yall Niggas can't fuck wit these
(Ah!)

[Hook]
Life amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost angels
In the city we work the angles
And Live amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost Angels
In the city we work the angles
Life Amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost Angels
In the city we work the angles
LOS ANGELINOS
Los Angeles
The Lost Angel in the city we work the Angles

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Yo in any place that you stay
The day is what you make it
Any given day in L.A it could be taken
For any given reason like fraud types caught for treason
Or just in the line of fire its Duck Season
Use words wisely on the phone lines could be hot
Trees don't need to cop
Cause I already got
My fire gets lit
I'm that Jim Morrison shit
And right after we light another JAY for Jam Master
(I have to)
Go all out
100 percent
I'm tryin to switch to mortgage payments instead of this rent
I do it on my own
Handouts ain't condoned
Imagine someone paying the bills for my home
I'm not the type
Got my own grind avoid the hype
Attract the women
Beats are chopped right
Flows are tight
L.A. born Dilated til death
Raised on KDAY, Chronic and weather The Worlds best
Check it out

[Hook 2]
Life amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost angels
In the city we work the angles
And Live amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost Angels
In the city we work the angles
Life Amongst the people
Los Angeles The Lost Angels
In the city we work the angles
LOS ANGELINOS

The Lost Angel in the city we work the Angles

[Verse 3: Defari]
See I'm all serious
All pro experience
I drop Ghetto classics like Eddies Raw and delirious
That means I'm excellence
Run with the best of them
Sandra Kid pushed out one of the best of men
I must be heaven scent
With a newer testament
The words an actions of men who sin and then repent
I beg forgiveness cause Babylon is so wicked
I can't help it if I drink and use my laker tickets
I gotta bubble
Hennessey make it a double
I play it cool while you fools play for trouble
The gimmickery
The felonious imagery
Niggas is cowards pouring drinks with there enemy
I'm like 10 of me pure righteous energy
These be like kennedys cursed till infinity
Dreamin to be from the 213, 310, 818, 323
Chuuuch
