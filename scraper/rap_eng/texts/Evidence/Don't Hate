I started my day great, don't hate what I do
Instead get a plate, heh, don't hate my food for thought
Don't wait, don't watch (don't hate) what I got
Even if it's not what I wanted to view
I'm first up to crack the blinds (don't hate)
Racin time, in fact I love to smoke la-la-la
They couldn't tell me nada, so I burned it up hot as the sun
And came back a product of my environment's done

[Defari]
Yeah, yeah, (don't hate) the maker, the car
They international - AH! Don't hate the actual star
Killer than me and E-V? No question
It's obvious, the homies are prosperous
Watch them study and follow this
Got love (don't hate) where I'm at
I never left, I holla "Don't hate, hit me back"
And now you seem bothered, don't hate, I'm runnin today
I'm switchin my gates in London at 8

[Evidence]
One of the greats, passports stamped up, don't hate
Wait a minute, listen, record spinnin, don't hate
I-I play the game well, lanes change course, don't make the Change of the Guard
My pen is like I'm in the pen far bangin these bars
Back from the yard, small glimpse, don't hate freedom
Eyes lock you in so I stay at the beaches
Fake chicks and leeches, I still {"don't hate)
I let 'em off, yellow car, then it's back to relate

[Defari]
Burn one before the wake up call
{"Don't hate"} the rise and the fall, I outlast 'em all
Don't hate the neighbor next door, I'm glad that she saw
Don't hate the tree that he rolled, the bag that he bought
The blunt that we blew, the courtesy call
Yeah, don't hate the live that I'm livin
The gift I've been givin, don't hate the love for my children
I'm wheelin and dealin, don't hate, the man is just grown
He does for his own, he rest on the throne

[Hook: DJ Revolution cuts and scratches]
I got mine, so (don't hate)
I got mine, so (don't hate)
I got mine, so (don't hate)
(Don't hate these haters at all)
I got mine, so I show no shame
I got mine, so (don't hate)
I got mine, so I show no shame
I got mine, so I show no shame
(Don't hate these haters at all) "I got mine, so I"

[Evidence]
Don't love some, (don't hate) either though
Fall into a glaze on between I don't even know
I'm no elitist but I flow how the people treat us
Needless to say I ain't walking on pins and needles
They can't figure it out, don't hate the recipe
I slipped 'em ether I, don't hate them testin me
The message is still here, no doubt just harder to find
Without Evidence, each time I'm part of the crime

[Defari]
Don't hate one, don't hate self never
Eighty degrees in the sun, don't hate the LA weather
I live the meaning of fun, (don't hate) the travelling man
With euros in hand for trees, in Amsterdam
Don't get crazy, don't hate me neither though
The way you actin right now, (don't hate) I'm glad you
Showed your true colors, can we drink one? (Don't)
I'm late for my people, gotta fly like an eagle
See you'se when I see you

[Evidence]
E, don't hate, no
The ratio, drop the hits without the radio
The lazy flow, spit quick, arrive slow (don't hate) the live show
The long line, the fact we on time, cloud control out my mind
I don't do lunch, don't hate the soloist
On my own terms of success, don't hate blowin it up
With chicks, no handcuffs, don't hate that
Let my birds fly last LP, some ain't came back

[Defari]
My hat says LA, (don't hate) the downshift
Watch the P car getaway, don't hate the fact
That it's life we bed on everyday
Don't hate the coach seats you have to sit on, you're in play
Still leavin the state, can't predict my fate
Don't hate the methods I use, the weapons I choose
Don't hate the minimal dues that you have a crew
Don't hate the fact that nobody's whole-heartedly vouchin for you
