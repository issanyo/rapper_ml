[Intro: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don’t stay
Trying to cope, boy I hope and I pray
Show me the way

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don’t stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I say hello to my people, hello to the day
I watch the world on wheels, hit the yellow and gray
The ones don’t work are the ones don’t eat
And once again, from the city where that sun don’t sleep
It’s time to get live because the terms are breached
Ride the wave like the world is a beach, learn more I teach
I was raised by N.W.A and stayed CA
All day, same story different brief case
I’m nonchalant to others peddling weight
I got a purpose to serving up and settle my state
Been through it, all of it great
Put the ruler to the movement, all of it straight
Big fish? Even calling them bait
One love, one dish, see ‘em all on my plate
I'll take the lady on a vacay, she call it a date
Now she calling in sick, now she calling in late

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don’t stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I’ve been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It’s a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
The moon tagged the sun in, love to be alive
Feet hit the ground running, butterflies in my stomach
Like I'm anxious trying to get it, trying to learn a lot from it
On a planet in regression, in a loft at the summit
Air is much clearer, catch me on the high road
Some fight to live, others settle for survival
It’s your world, you can write the line you live your life on
It’s heavy but you’re strong, just hold on until that light dawns
It’s started now, pardon me we’re partying
Escalating, redefining the state of the art again
Celebrated, elevators open up to secret floors
Different rules and secret laws, from the roof you’ll see the stars
Only fear boredom in a world of raw materials
Excited by potential, inspired by adventure
Calculated circles, circumference and radius
The only cats that float without a float through the parade is us

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don’t stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I’ve been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It’s a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way


[Verse 3]

[Evidence]
It’s routine, by the beach I rise
First up, I hit the weed then I bleach my eyes
Then it’s to the drum machine to speak my mind
Tracks like fitted hats, pick a beat my size

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Energizing, on the darkest streets I shine
Saw the light up on the mountain, to the peak I climbed
Breathtaking new perspectives on the life I grind
First tear of joy fell, looking like I’m crying
For a just a moment

[Evidence]
The feeling of being content
Not needing a dollar or a cent
Smile for my mama cause she proud
The studio, my headphones loud

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Bridge builders will connect these crowds
Dedicated on my honor you can check these vows
That’s purpose, power to make the powerful nervous
Hard work ain’t easy but easy usually ain’t worth it
They say

[Hook: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don’t stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I’ve been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It’s a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
