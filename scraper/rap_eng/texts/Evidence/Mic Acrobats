[Intro] [Man talking to crowd]:
Okay, do you want to see this guy jumping over this lady? (Yeah!)
Please do not run away. Stay with us till the end. We have many tricks for you okay?
Please, stay with us

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Flippin' the mic" - Jeru The Damaja
"Acrobat" - Akrobatik

[Verse One] [Big Pooh]:
Check the technique
The way I speak make hoes get out they seat, throw they hands in the air
This is just a flare
Be prepared
I might go Rick with the platinum blond hair
Me and Montage One, it's so unfair
Step in the room, everybody want to stare
Know a few women, but no, I'm not a player
Just fascinated by asses and long hair
A king in my chair
A prince amongst thieves
Branded on both arms, I'm forever long sleeved
No tricks, just treats
And I'm an educated nigga so I think before I speak
I gotta look before I make a move
Grandmaster checker players always get fooled
Delightful Bars out now, youngin get schooled
I'm a bear, little niggas just fish food

[Verse Two] [Montage One]:
Ayo we underground sensai's
Played by the DJ's and loved by the MC's and loved by the women
Hated by the wack niggas, feared by the weak, watch what they speak
Talk on the low when we present
And put away they wallets
Cowards pull they phones out and zone out
And dial 9-1 and then they hold out
They scared, panic
Look away and turn frantic
And hard niggas break like ceramics god damn it
We dominate out the gate, thoroughbredest
Shinin' shoe shit like begets and Berettas
Federano status, Los Angeles, Evangelous church rap
Mixed with that North Cakalac
Mic acrobats
The studio's the habitat
And Nat G studies
Gangland gunnery click claps
Cadence put your brains on your lap
Now your game is a wrap cause we changed all of that
Yeah

"We got the mic"
"Acrobat"

[Verse One] [Phonte]:
Phontigga with that monotone
Oops, I meant monologue
From bar one to bar sixteen in chronolog-
-ical order, they sayin' he's hard
Puttin' melodies behind these bars just like a xylophone
And if you scared nigga, go and see your gynocol-
-ogist, oh it's somethin' like a phenomenon
I spit it for my niggas tryin' not to kirk out
And girls tryin' to work out, get their Michelle Obama on
This year I had to make a Revolution
I mean I had to have a substitution
Wrong word
I mean I had to have an evolution
Get on my grind, make it up in my mind
That me and mine's ain't ever loosin'
So you can whine about your grands and your chips
Standin' there complainin' there with your hands on your hips
But you gotta stay afloat over these troubled waters
You can be a tough boat, I'm a championship, holla

[Scratch Chorus]:
"Flippin' the"
"Flow"
"Over the track"
"Like a mic acrobat"
"Manipulate the mic"
"Savagely attack this, rap classic"
"Microphone"
"Acrobat" - Akrobatik
"Flippin' the"
"Ill shit"
"For real"
"Over the track like an acrobat"
"Feel the impact"

"We got the mic"
"Acrobat"

[Outro] [Phonte talking]:
Mic acrobats, we ain't havin' that. Phontigga, Big Pooh
Montage One, let's get it done y'all
