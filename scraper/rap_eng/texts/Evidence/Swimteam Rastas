Yo, could it be I stayed away too long..?
Lighting up to Cypress Hill I was the side of the bong
Catching arthritis my pen was the heaviest
Bars trapped in a cell, run on sentences
Cleanse my readiness, my pencil is deep
I might erase every beat until it sends me to sleep
Send for the heat without relational guns
Send for weed drinking Jamaican rum
I only run between the moon and New York city with a crew that get busy like Bizzie be winning
And in the night still pitching like I’m in the first inning
Curve spinning these curtains are swervining
Disturbing images I cover the scent another visual
I mask and still never repent
Event the tide from the pull of the moon
From where I currently reside where its currently June
And kind of worry how my currency views
Kind of murder don’t mind if I do

My grandma and your grandma sitting by the fire
My grandma told your grandma, "I'm gonna set your will on fire"
Talking 'bout hey now

Cake is duffel the biscuits buttered
Placed in covered the steak is smothered
Monetary notes growing ropes homes on boats
That’s why every step I take is brothered
Step I fly off the handle to create my supper
As an OG told me a closed mouth doesn’t get fed
Push the level over the red
Pushes under my blankets they know to spread
Like butter and jelly over the bread
I’m on my alchensteam Toot-Toot!
Runaway train blowing his steam from out them things
That resemble a stove top kettle. Hot metal on schedule
I bust but your bumbaclot rasto seco
Like the chamber make my vocals echo...

From the moment that the ladies screamed me at the cheering
From the tone of the rain seemed so appealing
Did not invent the money printed but I’m getting it
Did not invent the wheel but motherfuckas spinning it
I’m not the paranoid searching for my calling yo
Straight out the barrio one baritone of audio
I carry on listen I carry on tradition
I took a toothbrush to old kids and pairs of blissen
So fuck this place and a staircase to sit in
In a city where you need a flashy car just to fit in
I never tried to make it I was only trying living
They claimed to know math but motherfuckers never divied…
Up sick of giving I got nothing to show
But ain't sick of being sick with it it’s the sickest you know

[Alchemist]

I don’t communicate with conversation
I stay up late nights in the basement
Charge extra for installation
Chop up loop like little bits of bacon
While I operate on a patient
Laboratory coats is what I’m draped in
More than the money notes my music is my motivation
Uh burn nicotine blow out Listerine
Lincoln to Michigan live from The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf
Depiction is off bring in the relief
Too many Indians that want to be chief
I’m confident with my spot nobody can oust me
As a youth my parents figured out they couldn't house me
Some even made me try to  play the sideline and couch me
Now they stand at attention every time they announce me
Success is my revenge
You throwing pebbles in the wind
I send messengers with a  pen
More medicine with the blend

[Evidence]

Caps are what I never type
Bought when I’m stepping out
Stack till I get it right
Red state blue state politics bang
The day is new same shit different game
Been running  ink to tunnel vision
Maybe it’s the night
So I’m waiting till the sun is risen
Some forgive some forget the summer debt
The summer time some will regret
Some of the bets win more then its less
I keep pressing till the vinyl breaks
Vital mistakes are at a viral rate
The eyes had it till they expand or dilate
I’m on the fire escape off the highest of flames
Debating science hearing sirens and things
I start my movement view to the stars
And start grooving pointing tools at mars
Licking shots from my union
I catch the plot when I clue in
I caught a permanent and never been removed since…
Bitch, bitch…
