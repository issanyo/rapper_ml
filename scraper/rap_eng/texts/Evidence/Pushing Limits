[Verse One]
Week in June I was born
I took form to take the whole world by storm
Ask the weather man why it got so warm
Armageddon has been in effect, you've been warned
Step like Griff said go get a late pass
Hope you're armor platted when the Dilated blast
Feel the full pressure, Rakaa the mic messenger
My DJ get around on the wheels bike messenger

[Evidence]
Yo Ice-T said...

[Iriscience]
And jaws just drop
But in the movies Schwarzenegger shot up a hundred cops
Pushing up blocks like plate shifts when quakes hit
Puzzling
I accelerate when the break hits

[Hook]
Yo Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"Let me show you something"
Yo Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"It's the hottest thing"

[Verse Two]
Sock it, the topic is Triple Optic
Rakka triclops blended [?] with the chocolate
Hard to hold back this swarm I can't stop it
Hard to keep change how I'm ripping up the pocket
Keep a seat, feel like I'm promised asteroids and comets
Heat seekers find the hottest spots still we bomb it
Burn down the city, tear down the town
And nail the whole state like a stake through the ground
Take two and pass
Make moves and cash
But first, do my part to make this whole thing last
Music that touches, rhymes that time tested
Never use questions, lives are invested
Want what I'm worth, in other words what I deserve
You're a customer that means you're gonna get served
Don't go to clubs where stars get on my nerves
I'd rather go to Griffith Park and observe

[Hook]
Yo Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"Let me show you something"
Yo Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"?"
Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"It's the hottest thing"
Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"And it's on it's way to the top"

[Verse Three]
The first time the fault was mine
The second time I kept myself blind to signs
I made you a queen, you broke camp, committing treason
Used to dig within myself for answers and reasons
As to why we act or should I say react to certain probs
Ones I tried to solve, baby doll you let evolve
See the brown hands, touch [?] holding 'em
Like the statues in Africa before Napoleon

[Evidence]
My mahogany

[Iriscience]
You represent the moon and me the sun
Thought you balanced me now I see that as a fallacy
Glad I found out before I let you get my back
Without knowledge of self how could you know how to act?
I thought you 'bout your pleasure point plus I shared my joints
Now I toast to my health, to my rhymes and my wealth
What G Rap say take that with you on the way down
Guess you're crying cause you know that lying doesn't pay now

[Scratching]  {x2}
"Step up front"
"Let me show you something"
"It's the hottest thing"
"And it's on it's way to the top"

[Hook]
Yo Iriscience pushing limits, what you up for?
"Let me show you something"
Yo Evidence pushing limits, what you up for?
"Let me show you something"
Babu pushing limits, what you up for?
"Let me show you something"
Dilated pushing limits, what you up for?
"It's the hottest thing"
