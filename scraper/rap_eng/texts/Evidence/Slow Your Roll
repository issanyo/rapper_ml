[Intro]
You wanna see a dead body?
You wanna see a dead body?

[Verse 1: Everlast]
Firestarter
Born to die martyr
Blow your whole armada
Clear out the water
Sun dried harder
Hell's much hotter
Top notch shutter
Peckerwood da-da-da
Some gotta love it
Some gotta get above it
Push a man, shove it
Till it ain't enough of it
Spike in your vein
Are lighting in your pain
But that habit gon' cost your soul
So slow your roll
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Stumbling across the road
A couple baggy from the from the man with the goat
You my catch a high buckshot low
Now you know
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Living down on a skeet road
Just waiting till they tag your toe
Now you know
How it go
Death comes slow

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Oh, I wanna know
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go, woah
Oh, I wanna know
When I fly to the sky are there's enemy down below
I wanna know
(You wanna see a dead body?)

[Verse 2: Everlast]
Down by the tracks
The foot of the hill
The junkie cats gathered
To cure their ills
The hookers and the trannies
Sell the thrills
Pimps in the cadillacs countin' their bills
I get chills
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Is this a corpse in the alley, just under the stairs?
The hookers gettin' beaten, but no one cares
They just stare
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Who wanna [?] if you dare
The streets are watching and you best beware
People are trife, life ain't fair
Don't get scared
(You wanna see a dead body?)
Tell me how much can you really bear
Before you caught up in the blinding glare
Love is kind, love is cold
Love is rare

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
Oh, I wanna know
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go, woah
Oh, I wanna know
When I fly to the sky are there's enemy down below
I wanna know
I said I wanna know, yeah
Is there a place up in heaven waiting for me when it's time to go, woah
I wanna know
I said I wanna know, yeah
When I fly to the sky are there's enemy down below, woah
I wanna know, yeah
(You wanna see a dead body?)
