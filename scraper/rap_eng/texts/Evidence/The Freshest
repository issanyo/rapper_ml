"You can't get fresher than this"
"And you know this man"

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Peace to first citizen Evidence and
I stay way from medicine and crooked ass friends
Some can't hear my cusses, Kendall please reverse my curses
I show my verse like cursor on WordPerfect
51, the title taken from those who trespass
Use the path don't step on my grass
From my whip you catch a lash from the whole paragraph
Without a doubt, similar to Guru I say my name and I'm out

[Red Foo]
I glide over liquid tracks like a Wave Runner
(Who is you?)
Red Foo and dude stay butter
Word is bond and I'm glad you know it
I'm just a poet
I ain't a superstar in a car sipping Moet
I got an afro pick, chick to keep it braided
Under hypnosis I leave MC's sedated
Don't gang bang but I roll with a clique
Fresh coast all stars, wack niggas get the dick

[Evidence]
I go nuts when my data corrupts
The error reboot
I stay cool like Cyrus Chestnut and reprogram
Chopping shit back together
My mission impossible completed, task defeated
We be detreated from the poison you're injecting
Replenish, Evidence I rock that shit from Venice
And extended measurements where there's MC's and poets
On stage I'm Mookie Wilson you're Bill Buckner and blow it

[Red Foo]
Understand we undefeated
Rappers who can't find theyselves look under "deleted"
Bo knows a lot, but not how I rock
I be the champion like Deon in the slot
Excel like Van, slam like Eddie
Bust a three on that ass the Hardway like Penny
Red Foo got it and there be no time allotted
For you and your clique, you ain't shit you ain't 'bout it

[Scratch Hook]
"You can't get fresher than this"

"My style is the best"

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Evidence a heavy thinker, intuitive bomb with ink or
Aerosol, hit the wall, flare the top of letters
Antennas pick up the signal
I jet before they get there
My eyes are open and taking focus and scoping

[Dre Kroon]
I turn to [?] and lit to go from my hip
Ammo bullets, anything I wanna shoot from my lip
Can't wait to step up while being back of the line
I be ahead of the class and adjust with time
Get mine, lyrical ambassador
I convey with the say, bring peace to war
Turn an atheist into a praising fool
Know the book of life, live by that golden rule

[Red Foo]
Check it, the mic is choking
I grips that shit tight
But I can't kill their mother, I got two strikes
So I lay on the under
[?] is my intention
Create Red Foo Inc once in all six dimensions

[Evidence]
This combination of stand out composition
At the right place at the right time due to keen intuition
I prescribe my own prescription
Pharmaceutical pharmacists dropping doses on both coasts
Alarm hits your eardrum
And tears from your eyelids downpour rapidly
Dilated mic maestros, have no apathy
For unrehearsed tragedies
Pull the plug
Move your neck, connected shoulders overflowing in the flood
