[Defari]
Evidence is the General
Defari is the Lieuteneant
And this that street music
That roll a blunt music, pack a bowl music
And we very adamant about this West Coast shit
And I'm here to keep tellin' you...

I'm often imitated but never the same
De-Far-I tatted in your brain
Rhymes are refined like a diamond chain
Some of y'all ain't even worth a pound of grain
I stay twenty steps ahead in my lane
That's twenty different ways not to sound mundane
I straight mash them with the passion and pain
That's why I give it my all plus what remains
That's 110 dogg, it never changed
When they announce my name, I fly the plane
I've seen the black Madonna's face in the mountains of Spain
I've seen the West stand up with the lyrics of game
I spit fire through the hail, sleet, snow or rain
I'm the sun that's blarin' through your window pane
I'm the one who elevated from whence he came
That first grandson of Mary and James (yup)

[Hook] - X 2
I'm very adamant, about this fresh West Coast shit
Oh nigga don't trip
One wrong move in your chest will dig
I congratulate you, just let me live

[Defari]
Fierce like lions jumpin' on they prey
They bump me in Japan, the man from L.A
I rock with the best that known for years
The champagne bottles, tour buses, the leer
The MTV, BET, the clubs
The X to the Z, P's halves and dubs
Frequent Flyer Miles like all day long
The pull ups, the dips, Steady Arm's that Strong
Limited experience not my cup
Take more than a stripper to get me up
And I don't mean from the bed, I mean for us to f---
Old school, I still call a ugly girl a duck
Shake 'em off, I shot the sheriff, take the bacon off
The streets of L.A. the black male gets taken off
Obvious I rhyme tight, you're the sloppiest
You're so off-beat, a degree below the novices

[Hook] - X 2
I'm very adamant, about this fresh West Coast shit
Oh nigga don't trip
One wrong move in your chest will dig
I congratulate you, just let me live

[Defari]
Smoother than a white fox in fresh snow
Break bread at the do' and see the best show
Defari, yes to Mr. West Coast
With the air from his chest he gots the best flows
Los Angeles, we gots the best 'dro
Man handle this, get in and let's go
What it do, nothin' less, Hennessy or Mo'
Tell the truth my concoction tend to be them both
Roll up a blunt and stay cool my nigga
The streets full of animals, they fools my nigga
The city's like one big zoo my nigga
The police can't stand me and you my nigga

[Hook] - X 2
I'm very adamant, about this fresh West Coast shit
Oh nigga don't trip
One wrong move in your chest will dig
I congratulate you, just let me live

Oh nigga don't trip... oh nigga don't trip...
