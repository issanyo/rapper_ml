[Intro]
She's never gonna say that I wasn't right there
She's gonna say "He was right by my side"
Everything right there

[Verse]
My lady losing her hair
I go to sit with her, to sit in that uncomfortable chair
(Got it) holding her hand right beside me
Then bring the chemo out  and hook it to the IV
The doctor like a dealer way pumping the drugs
Hard to watch shit like this like give a fuck if you thug
Don't give a fuck if you seen it all you ain't seen this
When the mother of your first born son clench a fist
From the pain, from the poison that they pump in her vein
Trynna circulate the system, trynna say she ain't sane
But she is she's just going through the motions of it
And this a feeling that I can't counterfeit; It's making me sick
I better watch what I complain about
I better make my self a good day he promised that we stay around it
I look my eyes in the sun, I mean my son in the eyes
And ask what the fuck I've done that ever feel so alive

We alive
Survive
We alive
We alive

[Evidence talking]
Had my first son Enzo Taylor Perretta on December 24th 2015
His mother was trying to breastfeed him and she found something when she was trying to do that
It turns out she has a stage 3 c cancer, and he saved her life man he really did
So you a blessing my G
I love you
