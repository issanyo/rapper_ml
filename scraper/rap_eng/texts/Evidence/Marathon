Dilated!
Clap your hands! (x6)

[Evidence]
Yo, first up, I stay updated
Stay in the zone, and no question, stay "Dilated"
Understand, I exercise patience (right, right)
Respect my path, cause the road, these cats paved it (set it off)
Now that we've got that straight, it's time to move on
I don't train for sprints, I train for marathons
A long haul, we're built for this
It's proven, every year, more people cop our shit
The point I'm getting at, we're building an army
Couldn't thank 'em enough, for real, I feel strongly
Right now, we're parked in a comfortable spot
By 2004, we're out to own the whole lot (Out for the top!)
To settle for less, the short change
So we keep our heads with us, as there's more to gain
And with, war is pain, so we roll the dice
It's all for the love, but some pay the ultimate price (check it out y'all)

Chorus:
[Group of singers]
Yo, they go off when they go on
On and on, on and on (Evidence: Marathon)
Pace yourself so you can face yourself
Run hard, you really only race yourself
Yo, they go off when they go on
On and on, on and on (Evidence: Marathon)
But we don't run from shit, we run to it
Might run over your shit or run through it

[Rakaa]
I crack my own tooth, man, rap's a tool
Just to spit, crowns will leave your head wrapped with jewels
Respect that, even if you don't respect that
Label politics are just a minor setback
As long as we're willing and the heart is still in it
In the marathon, the artists will win it
Even though they want me to bite my tongue
Where I'm comin' from it's like "Fuck that, I'll still win it"
The long run separates the weak and strong one
Never underestimate how deep the songs run
[Rakaa and Group of singers]
Pace yourself so you can face yourself
Run hard, you really only race yourself, yo
[Rakaa]
Clap your hands, your hands you clap
Expansion Team rap then expand the map
With endurance, intellect, cardiovascular
Stamina, Rakaa's a party flow master like this!

Chorus

[Rakaa]
I'm like Axel when they kill Mike for the bearer bonds
Driven to fight, livin' in the marathon
Some can't carry on, they're tired or feel ill
But in the end, real soldiers are still will
Sometimes, it's just spectators and gladiators
Same party, next year, haters congratulate us
To Buddy Princess and Jalen, congratulations
This year, there's less funerals than graduations

[Evidence]
Yo, pace myself, cause sagas continue
Standing ovations, Dilated blows up every venue
A new era, placed first, style pursuing
The shoe fits? (Wear it), it's based on you and
Your off beat DJ
Anything he play
Sounds like Babu pulled the plug with no delay
This homestretch
I've saved my last breath (breathing noise)
I push full throttle, no rest till nothing's left
It's the marathon

Chorus

Clap your hands (x5)

Check it
Expansion Team forever
And the, Alchemist
