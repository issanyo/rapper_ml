[Intro]
(Ohh shit)
Yeah
Nah, I can't complain with them

[Chorus]
(Ohh shit)
Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain (ohh shit)
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame (ha-ha)
And they don't treat me the same (they don't treat me the same, dog)
But yo, I don't complain (ohh shit)

[Verse 1]
Yo
Peckerwood status, live since Illmatic
Barnacle static like radical fanatic
Jump out the Benz with a semi-automatic
And rob all my friends like a fucking drug addict
Revolutionary, very necessary
You couldn't bust a cherry
Fuck your commentary
I'm so legendary
Born to get rhymer
Youngsters act scary when they 'round the old timer
Like "Yes, sir. No, sir. Truly, it's an honor"
Farmer of drama
Harvesting karma
Kamikaze die bomber on suicide mission
My mental condition 'bout to come to fruition
I'm all natural, no preservative
Style superlative
You don't deserve to live
We never truly die
The God was never born
Tell your vision lies
And watch that murder porn (ohh shit)

[Chorus]
Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain (ohh shit)
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame
And they don't treat me the same
But yo, I don't complain (ohh shit)

[Verse 2]
I smoke like Willie
Party like Waylon
Wilder than David Lee Roth from Van Halen
Batshit crazier than you'll ever hear from Sarah Palin
Here's to smooth sailin' on all these rough waters
Mothers love their sons, fathers love their daughters
All the things they give us and all the things they told us
The love that first made us and all the things that taught us
Like doing all the others
Loving all your brothers (ohh shit)
And helping out your neighbours when they need a hand
But every woman solo went thru love like Paniolo
And it is hard to tell a woman sometimes from a man (ohh shit)
So all the confusion and everybody's losin'
Livin' fake lives up on Instagram
But everything is funny when you front for the money
While the devil executes his fucking masterplan, like

[Chorus]
Brand new sneakers and a fat gold chain
We do the good cocaine
And we don't feel no pain
So yo, we don't complain (ohh shit)
Everywhere I go people know my name
We got the money and fame
And they don't treat me the same
But yo, I don't complain
