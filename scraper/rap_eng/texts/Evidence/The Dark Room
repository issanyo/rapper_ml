[Intro]
He plays guitar in Band X
In the same old formula as everyone else does
Why can't he break out? Once you check out all those rules
You can really start to explore music
Music, music, music

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I felt emotions so deep, but my words got blocked
You see I never smoked before so my nerves got shocked
I couldn't talk a word, but I could see the world
I mean everything became so clear
I didn't slur shit, I just kept quiet and made a note of it
Before the poetry is out the fire and I'm over it
Retire notably and every move's a curtain call
Smooth with the groove so honey don't take it personal
I'm trying to make it out of dodge, don't need to see the rainbows end
I need a lift before I'm looking at the wall or great descent
I owe rent and love the months that got a 31
I miss Pun and only met him once
This is kettle chips and blunts, the funk
I'm on the road still, I'm on a cold bill
She got a coke body so ill
Pick the code to the lock and all my people free
I found the road to the top behind the...
So let's turn to chapter one, these are the hood parts
Life is make believe and death is when the book starts
I got good heart and ain't afraid to show you
At fifteen I shot a .22, now I'm older
I spill my sixteens and dip clean
This body grown up and clinging to these kids dreams
I found a new feeling, I'mma chase it
A newfound town, a new scribe, you can't erase it

[Hook: Vince Staples]
I done tried, I done tried, I done tried, I done tried
You don't live till you die, hell or home you decide
Near the flames of the fire, near the flames of the fire
Near the flames of the fire, near the flames of the fire
I done tried, I done tried, I done tried to survive
You don't live till you die, hell or home you decide
Near the flames of the fire, near the flames of the fire
Near the flames of the fire, near the flames of the fire

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
I swam in oceans so deep the models seem like dots
Something brushed up against my feet my insides dropped
Fought the panic and I swam to the top
The only non one-percenter member climbing back onto the yacht
It's a strange life, wonderful world, process the pain right
Enact change, sipping champagne the same night (blah)
Half disgusted, half delighted, half divided on it
I Robin Hood and I smile, mad inside I'm haunted
But party to the break of dawn, until the night is gone
In glass mansions they throw hard words like right and wrong
Intoxicating darkness but my light is on
These battle hymns ballad of the freedom fighter song
Life chiseled into blocks, on the wall and into skin
Complicated ultimately, only spare the innocent
Festivals we massacre, hit the stage and snipe them from it
Kill in grimy clubs close and personal like knife to stomach
The code is in the DNA of the fan
Talking flashlight rips with DNA in the dam
Worldwide, running live-fire exercises, flame throwing
Gasoline graffiti bombing, drop the joint, the names glowing
That's burner redefined, learn to read between the lines
The subtle hints and clues, the symbols and the signs
It's Rakaa Iriscience, recognize the grand design
Making more move than just clock hands and sands of time

[Hook: Vince Staples]
