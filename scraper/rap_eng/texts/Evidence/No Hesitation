[Verse One: Alchemist]
Gotta make my moves I don't hesitate
Foreclosing move on your real estate
Burnt trash I incinerate, pen dancing
Sliding over ice like it was laced with figure skates
Urban legend toss a rhyme like lettuce dressing
Make an impression, give fresh no second guessing
I'm visible, original like Michael conception
My perception, only prescribed by permission
Chemical, I write novels like Charles Dickens
The plot thickens while you caught sleeping
Instrumentals move the crowd when I'm not speaking
Hesitate, make a mistake, I start creeping
From out the woody where we smack you out your hoody shirt
While you sing like LeVert, my fingernails dirt
It represents me


[Verse Two: Evidence]
Don't never hesitate, next up to demonstrate
How I took the featherweight title to the heavyweights
Tougher than the leather I would carry on my vinyl crates
Rough around the edges mother fucker I ain't trying to race
Trying to get my mind straight to lace another banger
So I ain't constantly relying on these strangers
Trying to get my pace off one off before my anger
Danger, two shots, one up in the chamber
I never hesitate to write it like my resume
First words come to my brain I keep I set it scrape
I said its fake, i said its bait
I said I laid the worm on the hook and set a fucking stake
My center space is my center of crime
Im descended from a list of those who center they mind
And setting up a sentence and sighting my prime
So every line is aged but ain't a sign of the times
Step


[Verse Three: Styles P]
Can't hesitate, hash help me levitate
Kush help me meditate, trying to get my cheddar straight
Ahead of my time therefore I'm never late
Can never be, got that prime megatron pedigree
On the high echelon could never get next to me
On the move got legs like a centipede
You can meet me at the table like the Genevese
Real boss nigga all will remember me
Alchemist and Evidence, this is evident
When Ghost there them niggas roll thicker than the president
Make a move nigga why you being hesitant
You can die off the work that devil does
If you G'd up get up on my level blood
If you hardcore get up on my rebel cuz
Pop him in the head like whatever what
He's a has been mother fucker or he never was
