[Scratch Hook] (x4)
My advice is to you
Think twice

[Verse 1] Prevail

I'm noting short of incredible
My make up of chemical makes me a two legged animal who conquers like Hannibal
Cannonball, my tentacle crushes your mandible. immalleable
Metal things wound in one round
What a one pound sound advice, while he pounds you in the ground
I walk crooked like Tender ten
When engage to defend it's a dead end
And you could end up with a dead friend
Then again you never know who lurks around the bend
I speak backwards with a top spin to shatter your abdomen
Before you clue to whats happening
The lights go dim
My mind's a grenade. My mics a pin
And you can get torn from limb to limb
My advice

[Scratch Hook] (x4)
My advice is to you
Think twice

[Verse 2] Madchild

My advice is beware of an Identity crisis
My advice is priceless. I'm as precise as a brain surgeon
Scalpel devices. No lightness
I'm twice as sharp as a mass murderers meat clever that dices
A Shogun warrior's samurai sword that slices
Execution as black axe attacks the nicest
I'm painting ill imagery with blood and guts
The ice is melting
Skulls laced
An escape watch
Jesus Christ is, hung at the cross
All holocaust. Paradise is lost
Nothing suffices. Drink with iron ices
To forget about the future, electrician splices
Lie lifeless
You couldn't take what my advice is

[Scratch Hook] (x4)
My advice is to you
Think twice

[Verse 3] Prevail

I'm from the widest range of strangers
My sights are locked in aim
Now claim the world wide stretch so I can never be tamed
I'm immune to the plague of people that get played
I always where a collar to hide my razor blades
Trap no-fill brigades, hit the field in the morning
Now the whole family's mourning cause they didn't
Heed the warning
I'm a sight, seldom scene. Candy man Cabrini green
I'm a classic in A major, Only bassets know where I've been

[Verse 4] Madchild

The price you can't afford
All praise the lord
Evidence is Sensei with the double edged sword
White lightning strikes. Earth shakes and cracks
Black magic attacks and packs of battleaxe
Zodak transforms into a fire breathing dragon
Rocks the fresh burners, the sickest attacking
I choose form of ninja. Knives and nunchuckers
So run for the hills you stupid motherfuckers

[Scratch Hook] (x6)
My advice is to you
Think twice
