[Verse 1] Illmaculate
I’m just trying to see the whole globe
It’s got me feeling like the road’s home
For those who miss me, shit is stone cold
This the life we chose though
I got scars, palms broke, pretty face, young mind, old soul
I’m trying to find a calm, that’s why I blow drough
But only time I catch a high is off my own flow

I don’t follow trends, ‘cause I’m a nonconformist
I walk into a room and all the roaches scram
200 days a year I’m doing shows across the (Land)
Road warrior, but that is how I make 600 grand
Face mask, Mad Max, I am racing through the (Land)
Motor mouth, I’m in my condominium
Continually letting off round like Palestinians
