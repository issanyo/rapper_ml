[Intro: MC]
So I want to bring to the stage right now: Evidence, Rakaa Iriscience, and DJ Ba-bu!--The Dilated Peoples!!
Showtime / Uh oh!

[Hook: DJ Babu]
Dazzling, dilated displaying a new sound
We are live on stage
Check it out, you now rockin' with the best

[Verse 1: Rakaa]
Basic mathematics, add shit, subtract shit
Me and the mic we got this animal attraction
Mid-city out to Manhattan, ain't nothin' fancy
Yellow cabs passing me by, I caught the [?]
Keep my team moving through lights, cameras, and action
Thoughts to ideas, designs to manufacturin'
Ev still Travolta, I'm still Samuel Jackson
Blastin', Live On Stage is where it happens
Step to the zones, spotlight on
The sights on, all eyes on
Turn the tables and the mics on
Fans slappin Rak and they scream out loud
This time I give it back and applaud the crowd

[Hook: DJ Babu]
Dazzling, dilated displaying a new sound
We are live on stage
Beat Junkies!
Check it out y'all, you now rockin' with the best like this
And we do it for you, and we do it for you, and we do it for you

[Verse 2: Evidence]
(You know we)
Break barriers, redefine and coast
Yo determine like John Walsh, America's Most
"Evidence"
Say my name out of self defense
Catch me on stage with B-Real off two blunts bent
(You?) You almost famous
We got groupies that call themselves band aids to keep their feelings painless
Nothing to lose, got only shit to gain this year
Out of control, cars with six gears
Flow for my peeps and peers
Know we takin' Live On Stage
To new levels this year (watch out)
Not here to chase fans
I'm here to rock for people who feel my band
Connect dots across the land

[Hook: DJ Babu]
Dazzling, dilated displaying a new sound
We are live on stage

Babu cuts into Alchemist's instrumental

[Scratch break]
*This is what it is*

[Verse 3: Rakaa]
There are lessons not taught that kids will still learn
And joints that not hot that cats will still burn
Pro [?] selectors, primetime announcers
Fans and promoters, bartenders, and bouncers

[Verse 4: Evidence]
Throw a jab at these cats, quick to counter
[?] how precise, the highest gets encountered
Takin' over, set the pace for new seasons
People questionin' my loyalty for no reason
Treason? Never back out on my team
Fuck fake expansion anthems, loose on the streets
As for beats, keep 'em sharper than cleavers for meat
This is the elite, true and D
We playin' for keeps
