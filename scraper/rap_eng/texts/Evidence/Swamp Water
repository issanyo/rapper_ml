[Mad Child:]
Calculated cold blooded killer
A methodical animal of the dusk
I'll blow the planet to dust
Hell boy acid drenched
Dead lift danger
Born with horns fight it
I'm the misguided angel
Touched by tradgedy
I defy gravity
Brutal cruel and dark
So beautifulfy remarkable
Angry Smurf
Man I'll kill these giants
Outnumbered, out flanked
Yet still we triumph
Hell's coming for breakfast
The end has come
You ain't a gangsta
You ain't even friends with one
Got your chain got your watch
Tryin' to act hard
I'm at my house raking leaves in my backyard
Baby venom spit flame
Eat lightening and throw thunder
You could feel my pain
I'm the hurricane hunter
Mad Child's the barbarian bent on revenge
Euphoria
Shatter the skulls of doomed warriors

[Phil Da Agony:]
Ink in the bark
Sharks come circle your block
Thirsty niggas off the jerky and pot
Workin' the slots
45 minutes to Vegas
We got the old school tan capsules
With the brown cap Vegas
Sega Genesis my Xbox extra hard drive
Fuck around and catch a fat lip
Like the Pharcyde
Trigger side we on the hammer side
Ya'll on the other side
We the type of guys
Pride will get you all fucked up
Stuck in a ditch
Swoll up, reaching for ice
Son of a bitch
The more we smoke
The higher we get
Ya'll should retire
Cause I'mma spit fire
Whenever I'm lit
Shit happens clean up your act
The nicest
Meanest niggas you know
Getttin' that scratch
Hittin' it from the back chicks
Strong arm steady
Phil Da Ag we the shit bitch

[Planet Asia:]
Rowdy niggas throw out bows to this
Snow cone wrist rap independent rap cats
Rollin' in with big straps
And you ain't nothing but a faker
My empire we settin' fires
To your acres
Now notify the cake makers
Pagans
Celebrate holidays of self hatred
Controllers of the matrix
Crack conspirators
Cocaine distributors
King of my chamber my language is imperial
Stereo burials body up you karaoke ass
Cats with certified ASCAP material
Them old gangster spirituals is for the Gs and soldiers
Practicing my scare tactics
Keeps MC's in yoga
Just like I keep a bad bitch
Between the sheets up on me
Boss like Tony Montana soprano
Asiatic Black with the attitude of Italians
My 9-5 is talent
100% stylin'
All violent
