Crop, crop again
You know the backbone of hip hop's the DJ
Lot of people talk with their game with their mouth
Dangerous people to hang with

That's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Hit the turntable listen
That's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Dilated junkies make the rookies drive slow

He don't need no introduction, he just bust in
Grab the turntables and then start hugging
DJ's are ducking, tucking their tails running
Well blunted, rocking the twelve hundreds

Or vest tax, one of them fresh cats
The type you definitely wanna bless with rats
So recognize that you met your match
But check out Babu with the cold, cut, scratched

Break it down
Break it down
Break it down

Yo, bring it back Bab's one more time, that's fine
Face off on tracks while you walk the plank
And now drums are come back
With redemption of Shawshank

That's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Dilated Junkie
That's a dangerous man who speak with his hand
Junkie is the keep, junkie is the keepr

The DJ's in effect keep holding it down
P Junkie sound system just rolled into town
The world USA and CA rock, LA rock
The funky presented J Rocks

Funky present
Funky present

Keep it movin'
And show my cats how it's done
Visionary Redmatic, next up, hit the one

You know the fucking concept
Whenever we step to this set is no contest
Come on, come on, come on

When I do my thing I'd be on some more of shit
To service qua two, Babu with another hit
Cause if you ain't a beat junkie then you ain't said shit
Like that

This is with an expansion team
Beat junkie sound, sure short production
Live and direct, on the ones and twos
Redmatic, Babu and the beat junkie sometimes
