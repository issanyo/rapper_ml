"Ladies and gents this is a major event" - Planet Asia 'Pure Coke'

[Verse One: Rakaa-Iriscience]
Puffing good shit, even though that bullshit's cheaper
It's magic, we're turning this bag into ether
It's madness, smoke fumes leaking out your speaker
Domingo brought heat, here comes the heat seaker
Rakaa, fights for the rights of free thinkers
Rakaa, lyrics the life effects linger
The record companies send biters after me though
A bunch of dead clones is what I might bring 'em
Oh things have changed, try not to complain
Even though they're pulling cats off of trains and planes
It's hard relaxing in coach reading Maxim
Legs cramped, still globe trotting for Expansion
Clap to the live libation you clap
Dilated, L.A. vibrating the map
I'm a preacher's son, annotated from way back
Official Joints got missiles pointed straight at your hat

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Two: Evidence]
Yo, another execution, built from scratch
Split finger fast and hard to catch
Another roach in the ash, a new opening act
Another day has passed, let's turn checks to cash
Procedures, flows and features, options got
Kits of stock shit, polished spotless, cop it
Domingo bangs beats out like Ringo
Starr for your streets and heat for your car
Every line is a bar, every word is my bond
Every snare high and kicks is from my peeps moved on
Yo crew's pop for every bass tone and loop chop
Fuck who's hot and who's not, stay on point
Stay on joint and stay low key
And stay close to my people who are close to me
Yo peace Defari, Heiro, Extra Polific
It is kind of different so let's get specific

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Evidence]
Yo, is your hand on the wheel?
Steer, you in control
Take your foot off the gas now hit cruise control
What happened to me? Nah what happened to you?
I'm at the lab, I throw a party on Capitol's roof
Acting a fool
Music? Dear
Like my Peoples and so I share true feeling far and near
The odds I favor this year
Fuck the format, loud and clear
Yo, let's get specific y'all

[Rakaa-Iriscience]
Right here
You don't even need to shine light here
I got light
Homie I'm spitting the spot light
I way I snap bristle with Joints that's Official
Spectators wince and say damn that's not right
All night marauding for ears, water to water
And build bridges to reach new sons and new daughters
Bab's on the scratch
Expansion Team stay up bat
We true crusaders of rap
It's like that y'all
