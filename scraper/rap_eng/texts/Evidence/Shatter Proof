[Verse 1: PR]

Truth
My people make your soul shatter proof,
You see in the booth I spit the truth
Thats all i wanna do, I gotta explain this frame
That we try to maintain, its the figments of the brain,
This physical realm does not contain, what the soul really craves
You won't see that till day, you hit the grave
Hope your soul is raised, to the eternal stage
Where we orchestrate the play, the universal way,
Understand what I say, love this realm, and love what you've found
But please realize that there's more to the sound, of your heart going pound pound
Of your heart going pound

[Hook : PR]

I gotta spit these lyrical rounds, to explain what I've found
In this life you go up and you go down, but you gotta stay up to get the crown
Yea you gotta stay up to get the crown

[Verse 2 : PR]

No jokin' around, i hold it down
Please wrap you mind around every sound
Hope my words lift you off the ground
Shed that stress pound by the pound
Feel your soul risen faster
Cuz any dark matter is not worth the matter,
But things like lyin' any stealin' just for the feelin'
Will leave your soul villain, to not enjoy the feelin'
Of third eye precision, fuck a normal vision
I feel like nuclear fission, weak minds can't even begin to envision
Its a whole life's mission, I gotta spit these lyrical rounds..

[Verse 3: PR]

To all my haters talkin' shit, I just really think your pissed
You little chinchos and chinchas ain't shit, no hate I keep it positive
I'm just expressing how this is, my soul is like the spliff
I'm a fire rising higher, can't handle it? well handle it
I'm like a bag of cannabis, get your mental lit to this shit
Oh you don't wanna hit? well more for my kin
If I call you Fam then you really in, to this fly elevation of your mental station
Please spread it through the nation, we need participation
I'm a Valley Chief callin' for some patience,
Yea mother fuck the masons, and this corrupt fuckin' nation
Stand up and take your bacon, it was ours from the makin'
