Mic check 1-2, 1-2 (Esoteric)
Mic check 1-2 (Alchemist)
Mic check 1-2, 1-2 (Evidence)
Let 'em know how you do

[Verse One] [Evidence]:
Yo, still huntin' for my woman I'm an optimist
Top the list of women like Erin Brock-a-bitch
I plant seeds in my metropolis
Yeah, a little E, tellin' people who his poppa is
Never stop the Rock Steady Anniversary
Never stop slangin' tapes like Percee P
Mercy me, I Pay Dues when Murs and Super needs me
I should've headlined but other sales supersede me
Who's the genius? Nah, who's the genie?
It disappear, reappear, clean ain't easy
To reinvent it
Drinkin' from wells for water
To find the fountain of youth
Of proof I'm offered the truth
I Rock Bells I gave girls hell with two L's
The new James I blew flames till they lose cells
I spit raps for an hour and change
Sign autographs then hit the showers and change
(Let's go!)
Yep
I might devour the game

[Alchemist]:
Or just chill while I roll up the most powerful strains on the planet
Brothers just step, rock harder than granite
Huh
Set off the smoke alarm, start up a panic
Holes in the carpet, spit Lebraya tar pits
Bummy as fuck
Sift through the garbage, don't piss on a target
Throw down a credit card
Let 'em charge it
Valet the bucket, let 'em park it
I'm already smokin' so let me spark it
Paper or plastic baggage wrap, I corner the market
How we do
Mixin' yellow with blue and make green
Dinosaur drummer, I still press buttons on the machine
Need more dirt, I don't like anything that's clean
Plus I don't wash so funk flows off me
Eight spliffs, seven cups of coffee
So I don't bang drums softly
Step brothers, 7L & Eso
Better than techno
When I do show my ? glow
Yeah

[Esoteric]:
When I do shows my flows Destro from G.I. Joe
We put heads on silver platters, yeah the illest rappers you know
Oh, we line 'em up like a funeral procession
Then we knock 'em down like we bullyin' freshmen
You don't wanna test 'em
Alchemist and Ev and E.S. and 7
DC my brethren
Choose your weapon, Magic and Bird
Oh yes we reppin'
I lock myself in the studio session like it's jail
It's ironic really cause the inks fresh out the pen daily
You only poppin' shit when your crews around
Talkin' prison? You only hit the Bing when Google's down
Please
We rock shows, take the videos and post it
Fans say, "Oh shit"
Then talk your ear off like Van Gogh's chick
Haha
Give me a mic and I'll function
I'm bribery, I'm corruption
I'm final, be no discussion
I'm like an island of one kid
I don't need introduction
Your single is like Laura Ingalls
We Wilder, you just frontin'
Ayo
