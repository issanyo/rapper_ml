[Hook]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Another bad dream, another blunt gets burnt

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, I tried ambient (darkness!)
Trynna find light, he keeps panicking
The overlooked Los Angeles, watching the spy's
Watch surveillance cameras, every breath I take
It's no motion like inanimate object
Planning my project, ramming through concepts
Run with my gun out, chain like luminance
Day time dumb out, sun on the ambulance
Maybe I'm just rumbling on, my beat sequence
My dream won't follow the song
Let me explain, I hear thunder in summer time
Visions appear, some clear and some under line
What I've seen, smelled, tasted and touched
Forms ghosts in my sleep that I cannot clutch
But when my eyelids close, there's no islands, just violence here
Magnified loud sounds of gun silencers
I dream of people who passed on
I talk to 'em but don't usually last long
I might dream that I'm holding my mothers hand
A cold sweat, wake up, holding my other hand

[Hook]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Another bad dream, another blunt gets burnt

[Verse 2]
No dough moments, no dry days
Six in the morning, a car peeled away
My girl mumbled then I stumbled to the front door
Who the fuck is this? and what they on a run for?
Lunch (?) plates in the distance
I saw lettuce but couldn't get specifics
Looked back saw my window shattered, stepped on glass
Bleeding to death, now my life just flashed
I wake up to hear the sounds of alarm clock music
Bang along beats like a bomb dropped to it
I choose to use the snooze button
Tried to write them down but always seem to lose something
The first time of my life the bell saved me
You falling, hit the pavement, they say there's no waking up
From the psychosis, screams like roller coaster
Passed generations watching over my shoulders
When the months starts with Sunday,  a Friday has a 13
Bad luck from walking under ladders become me
Scared to drive, I was haunted by Christine
From sleepless nights when I dream it 15
Paranoid cuffs cutting, go deep
I'm like a marathon, day straight, running on no sleep
No speed, I smoke weed, EV they know me
Bags under my eyes, from trees like groceries
