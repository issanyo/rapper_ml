[Verse 1: Evidence]
Sat on a bench penning a verse
Yes, it’s Evidence
Who wrote “For Whatever It’s Worth”
I let the ink bleed
‘Cause when I squeeze it’s cohesive
Make a beat, release the cold pieces
That’s the sound when I am down and out
Round and round, we go round another roundabout
The city painted blue or red is what a pound about
I’m steppin' out tonight, and god willing stepping out of bounds
I came up, but money can’t buy me
Love, but it can buy me other things I need
What? Do you think it’s time to break the gate again
I motivate and think bigger than money out the ATM
It’s as good as gone, shit, it’s as bad as here
Status, it’s the climate in the atmosphere
Things you can’t touch, spray but can’t brush
I guess the latency said a little late
But I can’t rush

[Verse 2: The Alchemist]
Sat in the back of the Jimmy Z
And I started sketchin'
One arm hanging out the window with the muscle flexin'
Stacy Adams foot on the seat, resting
Open the book of revelations and pick out a lesson
Powers beyond control of pencil
Draw blood every time I cut a record, I blow a vessel
You get charcoal
The battery charge while this Japanese sparkle in the carafe
Two fingers, raise the glass off the marble
It’s all a legend
Mix the medicine with the Benson and Hedges
Know where the ledge is
Might take a little off of the top, fade the edges
Still keep it crisp
Pay no attention to the politics, ‘cause ignorance is bliss
Complex napoleon, triple-X nickelodeon
Remove the garbage
Work the night shift, the rap custodian
Use your face as a tray to put out a bogie
In due recording, midnight, noon, or morning
So move according

[Verse 3: Rakaa]
I sat on a plane and let my brain unwind
Hot towels for my face and wine
Defying the laws of gravity, space and time
International air space, I’m flying with the divine
Keep the fact that race tracks could lead to dark places in mind
Exercising smart taste, refined
Higher than artificial borders in these man made lines
Thirty thousand feet above a past of man made crimes
The future is pure potential I’m promised
And unpolished, is raw
Soft clay, but data’s the new knowledge
The present is a gift, like my presence when I’m gone
In fact, it’s always right now, even when I’m wrong
The elevation never drops
Tell em better never stops
Watch ‘em play the part
I tell ‘em to get some better props
Understanding one world
Over trying to set it off
Looking down I see the bubble
Hoping that it never pops

[Verse 4: Blu]
Check it
I sat on a bus, brushing my wave
Sunny CA
My sunshine shine, as if it don’t rain
Your dame went from no name
To damn near knowing the whole game
That’s cold fame
My cell phone rang
My number don’t change
I picked it up
Had her pick me up from my domain
She drove a dope range
Like my blood brother who don’t bang
She love that Cobain
Because she blow brains and blow things up
Out of proportion sometimes
I light her propane
She like to hold hands with grown mans
I like to hold papers and blow cake like it’s my birthday
I feel I’m thirty eight
I say forget my curses, J
I should’ve went to church today
To wash away my sins
So I could shine, when them curtains raise
I hope the gas prices lower, like the murder rate
So all that bread can circulate, properly
Where the urban stay
So much red and blue, you saw it was a purple state
I guess they threw that gold on it and hopes Earvin stay
