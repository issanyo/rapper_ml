[Verse 1]
I’m buying watches that I don’t need
Paintings that I don’t need
Underrated aggravated angel but I won’t bleed
I live beyond my means, my whole story
But a few years of pain’s worth a lifetime of glory
I make lots of money but still stand still
Burden on my shoulders that is heavy as an anvil
Twenty years ago I used to tag mace on Granville
Now I’m spending twenty-thousand dollars on a damn grill
Just to cover all my fucked up teeth up
Many personalities, too much for me to keep up
Devil keeps knocking at my door I’m like “Jesus!”
Please tell this motherfucker just to leave us
Always got a bag of drugs and bad bitches too
Walk around alone at night like I am in a vicious crew
I only want drugs when I ain’t got shit to do
And right now, shit, I ain’t got shit to do

[Hook 1]
I know I sound like a broken record
My mind spin like a broken record
This beat sound like a broken record
Overprotective with my cats that are so connected

[Verse 2]
They look at me like I am perfectly sober
But this responsibility is working me over
Continue with this path, at most times it’s working
Please stop judging me ‘cause I’m not perfect
Silver tongue devil, demigod and a serpent
Hard to stay normal when your mind’s like a circus
I’ll just keep doing my best with this passion
Sometimes there’s too much pain that needs masking
Addicts are addicts, there’s no way around it
For years I found happiness, thank God I found it
I’m still a beast and a fire breathing dragon
Bumps on the road, just jump back on the wagon
Everyone slips up once, it just happens
Back to the gym while I stack bread from rapping
And this don’t mean that I’m not staying on the right track
Just don’t think that we are ever free from this trap

[Hook 2]
I know I sound like a broken record
My mind spin like a broken record
This beat sound like a broken record
Overprotective with my cats that are so connected

From the Bax War clique, that’s a whole collected
Was a time in life when I was so connected
But when I walked away I felt more protective
This beat sound like a broken record
