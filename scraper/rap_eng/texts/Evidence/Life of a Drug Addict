[Hook: Catero]
Just another day ‘bout to live my life
The same old thing

[Verse 1: Termanology]
You wake up feeling dope sick
From all the liquor and the coke sniff
Your hangover is ferocious
Bags under your shit like a boat trip
Staring in the mirror lost
Malnutrition since they cut the umbilical cord
Definition of a screw-up
When you was young, daddy used to beat you up
So now you got an excuse
Crush a couple pills up that you could toss in your juice
Family hates you. Nobody talking to you
Only thing they wish for you is a coffin for you
‘Cause you missed your grandma’s funeral
Cocaine residue on your cuticle
In high school you had a cutie too
Damn, what the fuck happened to you?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Slaine]
I know how it feel to wake up with your heart skipping
Couple pills stop the shakes ‘fore you start sipping
Wifey with the mouth smart, bitching in the dark kitchen
Kicked me out the house, start drinking. I would not listen
Hit the door with my socks, different routes of the pedico spot
See what Chico got, then I start sniffing
He got a bitch, high as hell who like to speak a lot
She’s fly as well, so we feed her blow, that’s how we keep a lot
Lose a few hours there then buy a little more
‘Till I meet Mariah who’s a flyer little whore
The more that she got wired, her attires on the floor
She’d get a little higher and she’d lie a little more
Days I lost before I came too
I miss a studio. I even miss my plane too
But fuck rapping I’m through
In the mirror staring back, “What the fuck happened to you?”

[Hook: Catero]
Just another day ‘bout to live my life
The same old thing
Just another day ‘bout to live my life
The same old thing
Just another day ‘bout to live my life
The same old thing
Just another day ‘bout to live my life
The same old thing
Yeah
