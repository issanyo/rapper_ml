I wonder when do the bells ring for me
When someone tugs a heartstring for me
When does it come the time
When does the poem rhyme
When do the songs they sing seem fine

To those who say "Wake up and feel life"
I say I'm ready, show me the way
Show me those arms that say
"Welcome to real life"
And I'll stay, I'll stay

How many parties and more can I run to
How many winter loves can there be
Before its all a bore
Forget it, I want more
I want someone to want more of me

Like making promises good in the daylight
The thing is here am I, where is she?
When is it my chance
When is it my dance
When do the bells ring for me
