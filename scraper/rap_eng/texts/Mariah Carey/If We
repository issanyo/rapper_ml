[Intro: Mariah Carey & Ja Rule]
I never thought (Who would've thought, baby?)
That I'd be (Missing you, baby)
Without you (I need you, baby)
Why me? (Why me?)
I never thought (Who would've thought, baby?)
That I'd be (Missing you, baby)
Without you (I need you, baby)
Why me? (Why me?)

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Love, want your body next to me
Or me actually off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
(Fuck) and fall asleep, locking' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up
Girl, we're losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy, babe?
I know you're mad but you don't really hate me, babe
It's deeper than that

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
And baby, if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
(I'd be your very best friend)
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side (side)
I'll give you anything you need to get by
(What you need to get by)
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again
(Baby, if we got together again)

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I hear the love won't wait
What if I had another best friend? (another best friend)
What if I had someone on whom I could depend? (me)
Someone who makes me feel like you used to
Tell me, babe, what would you do?

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
And baby if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally (I)
You'll never wanna let me go, baby (never)
I promise I will be by your side (I promise I will be)
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again
And baby if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend (If we got together)
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side (right by your side)
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again (Why me?)

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Why would you wanna go
Through the pain of loving another man?
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame we can't get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit the flesh is weak, but the game is strong
We go my way, your way, baby, we moving on
It's true, gon' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?

[Bridge: Mariah Carey & Ja Rule]
I never thought (Baby, there's nothin' to lose)
That I'd be (You know my soul's so cold)
Without you (And my love is pain)
Why me? Why me? (Spit it one more time)
I never thought (My baby)
That I'd be (Pride and joy)
Without you (I'ma make you mine)
Why me? (No doubt, Rule)
If we got

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
And baby, if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
(I would be your very best friend)
I would love you unconditionally (yes, I would, I would)
You'll never want to let me go baby
I promise I will be by your side (I will be by your side)
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again
(If we) And baby, if we got together again
(If we) Sugar, I would be your very best friend
(If we) I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
(If we) I promise I will be by your side
(If we) I'll give you anything you need to get by
(If we) Then my broken heart will finally mend
(If we) Baby, if we got together again
Baby, if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend

[Outro]
- So, don't you be getting all freaking on the first date
