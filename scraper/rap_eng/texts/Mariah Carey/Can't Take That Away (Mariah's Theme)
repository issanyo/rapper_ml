[Verse 1]
They can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down, but I will not allow
Anyone to succeed hanging clouds over me
And they can try how to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

[Chorus]
'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me, no, no, no
They

[Verse 2]
Oh, they, they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride and just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they can not possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

[Chorus]
'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes, they can try
But they can't take that away from me

[Bridge]
No, oh-oh, they can't take this
Precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly, the Lord will guide me where I need to go
Oh, oh, they can say
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to fall
Tell me what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes

[Chorus / Outro]
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me, no, no, no
Me
