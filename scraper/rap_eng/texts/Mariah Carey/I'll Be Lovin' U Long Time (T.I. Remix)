[Intro: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
I... (hey, okay, yup, yup)
I... (I know you like it baby, haha)
I... (yup, yup, okay)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (you know I like it baby)

[Hook: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
I, I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)) (MC I see you!)
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I know you baby shawty)
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)) (DJ tune, let's get it!)
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (growin' hustle homie!)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
You ain't even gotta worry, about a thing (okay)
I gotcha, babe (yup, yup)
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game, I'm here to stay (I know you like it baby)
See, our love is stronger than any drug
Addictive, just can't get enough (hey)
And every time I'm with you, I want some more
Just close the door, and let's explore each other (you know I like it baby)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Long as I know you got me
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (ooh)

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
Don't care what no one has to say (hey)
They don't understand us like we do (hey)
I need you near me night and day ('cause)
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do (yeah, yeah, okay)
Scoop me up and we can go (hey!)
To that little spot where no one knows (hey!)
Spend a little time, just us alone (hey!)
You can caress my body and never let go, oh, oh (haha)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
Long as I know you got me (I'll be)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)
There's no stopping you and me (no no, no no, you and me)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (I'll be)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (she gotta know I love her, shawty)

[Verse 3: T.I., Mariah Carey]
Show you I care, I try just 'cause ('cause)
Ten carat solitaires I buy, just 'cause ('cause)
I just love (love)
You in the nude, in the bed, in the pool
And your legs when you move (oh yeah)
All your booty and your beauty and the sexy way you do it
Make me wanna buy ya all the you desire times two (two)
Like the biggest Louis bags, the Bentley and newest Jags
And the huge pad and make you laugh when you be mad
Just invite your friends over for diner and you can brag
Chanel and Tiffany this, Versace and Gucci that
Lifestyle like that, if you leave you'll be back
Everywhere you could go, they either broke or pretty whack
Plus you ain't gotta ask where my heart really at
But you wanna waste time with one of them silly cats
Go and be my guest, though I don't suggest
It's just so hard to get love like this (oh oh)

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
I don't want another, ain't gon' never be another
Can't nobody do what you do to me (nobody)
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another (no)
Can't nobody do what you do to me (can't nobody love me)
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another (like you do)
Can't nobody do what you do to me (hey!)
I'll be lovin' you long (as I can breathe) (I'll be lovin' you)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (long as I can breathe!)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Long as I know you got me (long as you got me)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (ah, I)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (I'll be lovin' you long long time)
There's no stopping you and me (no no no no no, no no no, love you long time)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (I...)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (gonna love you long time!)

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))

[Outro: Mariah Carey, T.I.]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa... (I know you like me baby)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)

I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)
