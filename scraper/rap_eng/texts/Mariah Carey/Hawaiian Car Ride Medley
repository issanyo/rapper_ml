[I Know What You Want]
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
I know what you want, you know I got it
Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you
As long as you want, you know I got it
(Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you)
(I know what you want, you know I got it)
(Baby, if you give it to me, I'll give it to you)
(As long as you want, you know I got it)

Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high aha
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

[Breakdown]
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown, steady breaking me on down

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Because I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

[Obsessed]
And I was like
"Why are you so obsessed with me?"

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

So oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh, so oh, oh, oh, oh...

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?

[It's Like That]
I came to have a party
Open off the Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watching me
So what's it going to be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feeling me

Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Shake It Off]
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce

I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta shake you off

[Loverboy]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
I lover, lover, I lover, lover
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy for me

I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's delirium time

He's all mine
And his loving gets me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
(You know how to make me)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
