[Intro]
(Eternal, eternal, eternal)
Mine, mine, mine
You're mine

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel our love would never end
How can I forget, baby we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Chorus]
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
(Baby you're mine)
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Verse 2]
Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want you badly?
Wanted to let you have me
Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crush me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly?
Now I'm lying here falling apart

[Verse 1]
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you make me feel our love would never end
How can I forget, baby we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Chorus]
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
(Baby you're mine)
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Bridge]
You make me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that?
My baby, we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

[Chorus]
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine
I can't seem to give you up
You're mine

(Eternal, eternal, eternal)
