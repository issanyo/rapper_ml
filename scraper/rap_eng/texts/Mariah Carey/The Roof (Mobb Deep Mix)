[Intro]
(Infamous, it don't stop)
Hmmm (Ye, ye, infamous, knock em out the box, yo)
Uuuuh (I got you stuck off the realness)
Hmm (Infamous, knock 'em out the box)
Uh, ooh (I got you stuck off the realness)
Yeh, ooh

[Verse 1: Mariah]
It wasn't raining yet (yet)
But it was definately (it was definately)
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding (pounding)
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web (and I was twisted)
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

[Verse 2: Mariah]
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms (you took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time (and I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Everytime I feel the need
I envision you (envision you) caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

[Bridge: Mariah]
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you'
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
(Infamous rocks the box)
I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us
Score up in the project hall
Third floor gravitates on the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw bass
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you the one that's like my pistol, I said crystal
Keep you on my side 'til the ficial (yo, yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 4: Havoc/Big Noyd]
Ain't it ill how we click, boo? Just me and you
Got me stuck off the realness, just me and you
Up on the roof beats, Pebble beach
Talk to me anytime, even when I wit my peeps
Ruler L, why you smell like the perfume Channel?
Push big G's rappin' all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top
Do it 'til we both drop
M-O-B-B with Mariah sounds so hot

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everytime (everytime) I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
(Envision you caressing me)
And go back in time (I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On the roof that rainy night)
Everytime I feel the need (when I feel the need)
I envision you caressing me
(I envision you over and over and over again)
And go back in time (I go back)
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(It was, oh, so sweet you and I)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(On that rainy night)
Everytime I feel the need
(Last night I had the strangest dream)
I envision you caressing me
(It was actually quite symbolic)
And go back in time
(As I whispered that I loved you)
To relieve the splendor of you and I (very subtly)
Everytime I feel the need
(Infamous, ya don't stop, Infamous rocks your box)
I envision you caressing me
(Infamous knock out the box)
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
(Infamous rocks your box)
On the rooftop that rainy night
(Infamous knocks 'em off the box)
