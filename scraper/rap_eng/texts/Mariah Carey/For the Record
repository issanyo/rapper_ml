[Verse 1]
For the record, you oughta know
You wasn't thinking when you let me go
But whatever, that's how it goes
Win some you lose some and others you hold in your heart
Why it gets so hard, tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go, no, no, no
Suddenly you're here
And it's so surreal
And I don't know what the deal

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

[Verse 2]
Them other irregularities, they can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me
People see you now asking all about me
And how they always thought we were so perfect together
Let's re-write the end
Start over again
And it's gonna go better now

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

[Verse 3]
For the record
You'll always be a part of me, no matter what you do
And for the record
Can't nobody say I didn't give my all to you
For the record
I told you underneath the stars
That you belong to me
And for the record
It's obvious that we just can't let go of us, honey

[Chorus]
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try (One time)
Like back in the day
That look on your face
Feels like, the first time

[Outro]
For the record, baby
Now you know, baby
