Ooh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh ho ho

(Shamari)
It's oh so typical
You don't know where to go
Someone's got you broken inside
But don't you give up hope
It's just transitional
True love will materialize, yeah
You're gonna find it, but

Oh baby don't look for love
Don't you know that love
Will find it's way to your heart
Yeah, you're gonna find it
But don't go looking for love
Don't you see that love is there wherever you are
It's all inside of you

(Shamari)
You're searching for a face
To fill that empty space
But nobody's got you open tonight
Be patient and endure
Oh baby rest for sure
There will be salvation in time, yeah
You're gonna find it, but

Repeat 1

Gotta find a way to tap into your inner place
And make you stronger
You gotta make it make you strong enough now
Gotta let the pain subside and liberate your mind
Hold on baby, love will arrive

Repeat 1 until fade
