[Verse 1]
Once, I was a prisoner
Lost inside myself
With the world surrounding me
Wandering through the misery
But now I am free

[Verse 2]
You gave me a breath of life
Unclouded my eyes
With a sweet serenity
Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free

[Chorus]
Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine
Free to give
Free to love
Free enough to fly

[Verse 3]
Once, I was all so alone
Unsteady and cold
But your love rained down upon me
Washing away uncertainty, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
But now
I am free
I am free
