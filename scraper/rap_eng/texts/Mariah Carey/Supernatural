You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat
You make beat go

[Chorus]
Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

[Verse 1]
You got me lost in the clouds
Floating, like oh
Keep me here always
We’re the only thing that’s true

[Pre-Chorus]
Beautiful as the sun
Showers upon you, baby

[Chorus]
Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

[Verse 2]
We communicate without saying the words out loud
Heavenly, it’s more than a state of mind
Now that you’re in my life and oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate

[Chorus]
'cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

You make beat
You make beat go

[Pre-Chorus]
Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate

[Chorus]
'cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love

[Outro]
Our love
Our love

(You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat)
See, you make the beat go
On and on and on and on!
(You make beat
You make beat go)

I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love
