[Intro]
Whoa

[Verse 1]
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Verse 2]
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus]
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you're coming' back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've gotta face

[Verse 3]
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around to see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus]
So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face

[Outro]
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll be standing here
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Take a look at me now
Mmh
