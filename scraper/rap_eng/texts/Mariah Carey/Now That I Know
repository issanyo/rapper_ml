[Chorus]
Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

[Verse 1]
I never knew if I could believe in you
I thought I was just a diversion
And you were killing some time
My friends they told me to leave you
They said you'd never ever ever be mine
But you gave me your love
And you said I'm the one
You want for the rest of your life

[Chorus]
Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

[Verse 2]
I was afraid that it was all a masquerade
And that I was only a plaything
And you would leave me behind
But now I feel so secure
By your side I can conquer the world
Cause I gave you my love
And I know you're the one
I want for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

[Bridge]
I really feel it, so much love
I really feel it, so much joy
I really feel it
Sweet, sweet ecstasy
'Cause you opened my eyes
And I realize your love is real
It's for real

[Chorus]
Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore
