[Verse 1]
Yet another early morning and you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See, I know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'ed up it's over

[Chorus]
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do, baby
It's a wrap for you, baby (It's a wrap)
Shooo-do-do-do-do
It's a wrap for you, baby (It's a wrap)
Oh, baby

[Verse 2]
If I ever misrepresented my self image, then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent but I learned my lesson
Boy, you're sorry (Boy, you're sorry)
Bump, bump, bump, all out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me take a breath (Let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (Told you one more time)
If you f'ed up it's over

[Chorus]
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do, baby
It's a wrap for you, baby (It's a wrap)
Shooo-do-do-do-do
It's a wrap for you, baby (It's a wrap)
Oh, baby

[Bridge]
Put all of your shit in the elevator
It's goin' down like a denominator
Tryin' to keep holdin' on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gon' wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain't coming back
It's the Martini I mean it, baby, it's a wrap
It's a wrap, it's a wrap

[Chorus]
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
(You're dead wrong)
So just scroo-do-do-do-do, scroo-do-do-do-do, baby
Boy, I wasn't playing a game
I told you, I told you
If you f'd up one more time it's over (It's a wrap)
So get out of my face, I'm hungover
Been sitting here all night, leave me alone
Since quarter-to-three I've been drinking Patr√≥n
Watch the credits roll, it's a wrap
