[Verse 1]
We've known each other for a long, long time
But I never really noticed all the magic in your eyes
I've been around you a thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more
I must have been so blind, I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do 'cause, baby

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that
Finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious, so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you, sweet baby

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
(In the most peculiar ways)
I've been thinking about you
(Really got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me (it's unbelievable)
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you
I've been thinking about you, baby, baby, baby
In the most peculiar ways
(In the most peculiar ways)
I've been thinking about you
(Really got you on my mind)
It's unbelievable to me (it's unbelievable)
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you

[Bridge]
Don't you know that you're blowing my mind?
What you do to me, I can't describe (no, no, no)
Baby, I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
(In the most peculiar ways)
I've been thinking about you
(Really got you on my mind)
In the most peculiar ways
(In the most peculiar ways)
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' about you
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I've been thinking about you
(Baby, I've been thinking about you)
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling, I'm falling
In the most peculiar ways
(In the most peculiar ways)
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love with you
