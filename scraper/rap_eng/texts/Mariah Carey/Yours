[Chorus]
You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles, baby I'm forever yours, yours

[Verse 1]
Tender love's what you're giving me and
You surpass all my fantasies and
I keep thanking the Lord above for
Blessing me with oh so much
'Cause I know how it feels to be part of you, boy
Everyday of my life's so abundant with joy
And I honestly never thought love could be real
Until the angels guided you to me

[Chorus]
You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now
I believe in miracles, baby, I'm forever yours, yours (Yours)

[Verse 2]
Lying with you so natural
I never knew this was possible
And it finally feels like my life has begun
Now that I can share it with someone

[Chorus]
You brighten up the moon and stars at night
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now (Yey, now)
I believe in miracles, baby, I'm forever yours
You brighten up the moon and stars at night (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
You bring new meaning to my life, now (Yeah)
I believe in miracles, baby, I'm forever yours, yours (Yey, ooh)

[Bridge]
Baby, our love will always persevere (Ooh)
Anything you ever need
You know that I'll be right here and (And you know, and you know)
You don't have to worry, boy (Don't worry baby)
I won't betray your trust
'Cause I'm so much in love (So much in love)
Every time your lips meet mine
It still feels like the first time (Feels like the first time)
And if you lost everything
I'd keep on standing by your side (Standing by your side)
And boy, it seems like everyday
I fall deeper in love
Because I so can't get enough
