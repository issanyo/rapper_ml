[Verse 1]
I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky

[Chorus]
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

[Verse 2]
Limitless, omnipresent kind of love
Couldn't have guessed it would just stop
And disappear in a whirlwind
Here I am walking on this narrow road
Wobbling, but won't let go
Waiting for a glimpse of the sun's glow

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I can stand, just pull me back up
But there ain't a hurricane, it's just us (No)
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby, we can get back that shine

[Chorus]
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

[Bridge]
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you

[Chorus]
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
You and I said goodbye, felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it slip in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

[Outro]
Oh, babe, don't let angels cry
