[Verse 1]
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

[Hook]
One more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
One more night

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love tonight

[Hook]
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night

[Chorus]
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel (night)
Feel your body, feel your body, baby
I'd give my all (give my all)
I'd give my all
I'd risk my life
I'd give my all
I'd give my all tonight
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
I'd give my all for your love
I, I'd, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
