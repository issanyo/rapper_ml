[Intro]
Yeah
Andy Warhol said: «In the future, everybody will be famous.»
No, he said, «Everybody will be world-famous for 15 minutes.»

[Verse 1]
Gotta get up, 'cause you know the world is waiting
Can you keep up? Everyone you see is racing
And you know what you are
It’s true, you will go far

[Chorus]
'cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
Meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
They watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way
Meteorite-ite-ite
A shooting star

[Verse 2]
So here we go, listening, what are you saying?
Put on your show, try to make it entertaining
And you know what you are
It’s true, you will go far

[Chorus]
'cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
A meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
They watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way
Meteorite-ite-ite
A shooting star

[Chorus]
'cause you’ve got the night to light up the sky
A meteorite in front of every eye
A shooting star, your fame is a flame
As they watch you burn up, turn up, turnt up all the way

[Outro]
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
Yeah, you got me turnt up all the way
