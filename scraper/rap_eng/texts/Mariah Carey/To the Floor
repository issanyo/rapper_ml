[Intro: The Neptunes]
Oh, to the floor, everybody to the floor
Neptunes
To the floor, everybody to the floor
MC, Nelly

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
Baby, I don't wanna let you think I'm
(I like to try you, I think you so on fire)
Easy, like them other girls you be seeing
(I can't deny you, I be trying to fight it)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
I'm saying, I just want to make sure that
You really want me just for me
Because it's not just that I'm so impressed
By your cars and jewelry
And you know like I know
Feel that chemistry
(You know I feel it just the same as you
So why don't you bring that down to me?)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
Whatever happens (Whatever happens)
It's going down tonight
(I said, it's all going down tonight)
(I said, it's all going down tonight)
(I said, it's all going down tonight)
(So get ready)
Because you and me got business
We are gonna handle it tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
To the floor, everybody to the floor

[Verse 2: Nelly & (Mariah Carey)]
Shorty, I would never think that you were
(I like to try ya, I think you're so on fire)
Easy, girl, I just think that you are so outstanding
(I can't deny ya, keep trying to fight it)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
I'm saying, I just want to make sure that
You really want me just for me
Because it's not just that I'm so impressed
By your cars and jewelry
And you know like I know
Feel that chemistry
(You know I feel it just the same as you
So why don't you bring that down to me)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
Whatever happens (Whatever happens)
It's going down tonight
(I said, it's all going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
So get ready)
Because you and me got business
We are gonna handle it tonight
Tonight, tonight

To the floor, everybody to the floor
To the floor, everybody to the floor

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Looks like its right
For you and I

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & (Nelly)]
Whatever happens (Whatever happens)
It's going down tonight

I said, it's all going down tonight
I said, it's all going down tonight
So get ready)
Because you and me got business
We are gonna handle it tonight
Tonight, tonight

Whatever happens (Whatever happens)
It's going down tonight

So get ready)
Because you and me got business
We are gonna handle it tonight

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
It's going down tonight, it's going down tonight
It's going down tonight, it's going down tonight
