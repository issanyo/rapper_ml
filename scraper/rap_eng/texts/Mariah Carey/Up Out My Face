[Intro]
It's not chipped
We're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered

[Verse 1]
I thought we had something special
And we had something good
But I shoulda had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walkin' by ya
Boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you on a sofa
And I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy, this ain't no promo

[Pre-Chorus]
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your momma's house

[Chorus]
When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC'd all your friends
(I break) I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby
(I break) When I break, I break

[Verse 2]
So look who's crying now, boo hoo hoo
Talkin' about you're missin' your boo hoo hoo
No, you ain't getting it, no, you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop spittin' it
Ah, ha, ah-ah-ah-ah
You'll wonder who I'm messin' with while you ain't next to me
I'm going bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
So pay the consequences 'cause you acting all ignorant

[Pre-Chorus]
So you're ashamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your momma's house

[Chorus]
When I break, I break, boy
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face, boy, up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC'd all your friends
(I break) I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
They collecting my bags, baby

[Bridge]
'Cause I break, I break, I break
And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break, I break, I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again

[Chorus]
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
I break, I break, I break
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break

[Hook]
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get a lot of calls 'cause I CC'd all your friends
(I break) I ain't walking around all mopey and sad
Take a look at my bags, baby
'Cause when I break, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When I break, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break, uh
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, boy
Up out my face, I break
