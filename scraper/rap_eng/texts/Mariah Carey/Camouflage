[Verse 1]
I remember so many nights in the bed alone, wondering
Could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold?
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that’s alright
'Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself
It's fine

[Chorus]
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And ‘round I go
To know that you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)

[Verse 2]
Weary some times when I tried to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talked to me
Yet praying inside: "Let him love me for who I am"
Please, my Lord
But you were just somewhere that I couldn’t reach
Couldn’t understand
(All that I needed was you to really see me)

[Chorus]
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And ‘round I go
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)
To know if you still love me
(I need to know, say that you do)

[Bridge]
No, didn’t we swear we’d give it our everything?
(Didn't we swear passionate heart and our love)
Didn’t I give you all of me?
(Didn't I give you all of me?)
Oh, oh, oh
No night or day goes by
No, no, no
When I don't wonder inside
(You still feel the way)
If you feel the way you used to feel
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And 'round and 'round I go
(To know if you still love me)

[Outro]
(I need to know, say that you do)
I remember so many nights
(I need to know, say that you do)
I camouflaged...
That's all I really wanted
(Oh say)
That's all I really wanted...
(Tell me that you love me)
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh
(I pray that you still love me)
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh at the question
But I need to know
Weary some times when I try to discern our reality
