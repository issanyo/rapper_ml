[Intro: Wish Bone]
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break, breakdown
Teady breaking me on down

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
So what do you do when somebody said you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through?
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I Will Survive"?
Do you lash out and say: "How dare you leave this way"?
Do you hold on in vain as they as they just slip away?

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (how do you feel?)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
I'm gonna breakdown

[Verse 3: Krayzie Bone & (Wish Bone)]
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
(It'll break ya down, only if you let it
Every day crazy situation's rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it, forget it)
I been feeling like your breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress, stress
(Don't ever wanna feel no pain, pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain, rain, rain, rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain)
Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (How do I feel?)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel (how I feel)
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't wanna reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
