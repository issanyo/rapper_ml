[Verse 1]
Something that you do
Hypnotizes me
Sets my soul at ease
Every time you're near me
I'm in heaven baby

[Verse 2]
I don't know how you do it
Never felt like this before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
More and more and more

[Verse 3]
Something that you do
Mesmerizes me
Sets my body free
Every time you touch me
I'm in heaven baby

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all your love
More and more and more

[Chorus]
I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go

[Verse 5]
Every time you smile
It captivates my mind
And it lifts me to the sky
Anytime you touch me
I'm in heaven baby
I don't know how you do it
Never felt so sweet before
I don't wanna lose it
Give me all you love

[Chorus]
I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go

[Verse 6]
I just want
To be the only one you live for
I just want
To give you all my love
More and more and more

[Chorus]
I just wanna be around you
Tell me are you feeling the same
I just wanna be around you
Every minute of the day
Oh I'm never gonna let you go
