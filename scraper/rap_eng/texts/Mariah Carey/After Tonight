[Intro]
La-da-da

[Verse 1]
I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's like I'm lifted out of time
And time again
Patiently I've waited for this moment to arrive

[Chorus]
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?

[Verse 2]
I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
It's like I'm drifting out of
Time alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes

[Chorus]
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?

[Verse 3]
Time and time and time again (Time and time again)
So patiently I've waited for this moment to arrive

[Chorus]
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Baby, will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?

[Outro]
After tonight begins to fade
After all, after all, after all
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
After tonight begins to fade (After tonight)
Begins to fade
