[Verse 1]
Those days of love are gone
Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life, only for you
From now until...

[Chorus]
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one...
You will always be the only one...

[Verse 2]
As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years
From now until

[Chorus]
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one... yes
You will always be the only one...

[Bridge]
If you should ever need me
Unfailingly I will return to your arms
And unburden your heart
And if you should remember
That we belong together
Never be ashamed
Call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure

[Chorus]
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one...
