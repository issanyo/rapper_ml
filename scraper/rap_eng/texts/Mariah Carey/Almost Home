[Intro]
Hey, hey
You're almost home
You're almost home
You're almost home

[Verse 1]
I've seen the light in the sky
In disguise, like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark
I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom
I'm believing in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause underneath the good
Is something greater than you know

[Chorus]
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go (go)
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home, home
(You're almost home)

[Verse 2]
When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from
It's like some other universe
You count your steps like they're regrets
You catch one breath, then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn
So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

[Chorus]
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go (go)
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home, home
(You're almost home)

[Bridge]
When you let your heart be the compass
You won't get lost, not if you trust it
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before

[Chorus]
Oh, when you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go (go)
'Cause you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost
Home, home, home, home
When you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go (go)
You're almost there, you're almost home
(Know you're not alone, you're almost
Home, home, home, home)
