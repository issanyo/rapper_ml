[Intro: DJ Clue & Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, DJ Clue (yeah)
Desert Storm (yeah), Fabolous (Flipmode)
With Wilma M. Holla (Busta Bus, alright)
Pay attention (Oh, oh, oh)
Let's all form a line and focus (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ha ha
(I'm trying to save your life)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
We can do it in the mix
I'll even raise the privacy shade if we do it in the six
Everything his and hers
I know you like sipping K, moving until your vision blurs
Exquisite furs, this preferred
You even got a set of keys to the Spiz in Jers
Get your man that ain't promise
I'm the kid that'll make sure you keep that tan from St. Thomas
It's no trouble at all
So you can imagine after I go double this fall
Most this player can do is retire
I know Gucci's newest attire
And shoes is required
I don't care who was your priors
Any man saying he don't want you is a liar
All they can do is admire
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, I do this, Mariah

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & Busta Rhymes]
Last night a DJ saved my life (Come on, ha-ha)
Last night a DJ saved my life, yeah
'Cause I was sitting there bored to death
And in just one breath (Come on)
He said you gotta get up (Gotta get up, gotta get up)
(Yeah, just bounce around)
(Just shake that shit and bounce around)
You gotta get on
You gotta get down girl
You know you drive me crazy, baby (M.C., Wilma)
Turning to another man (Talk to him Wilma, talk to him Wilma)
Called you on the phone, no one's home (yeah, yeah)
(Just shake and bounce around, come on)
Baby, why you leave me all alone?
(Just bounce around, yeah, just bounce around)
(Just shake that shit and bounce around)
And if it wasn't for the music, I don't know what I'd do
(What cha' gonna do? Talk to me and let me see it, baby)
(Come talk to me, ha, come talk to me)

[Hook: Mariah Carey & Busta Rhymes]
Last night a DJ saved my life ooh

Last night a DJ saved my life from a broken heart (One time now)

You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far, no
Because I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind

But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
(Yeah, yeah pass that thing steaming over there)
