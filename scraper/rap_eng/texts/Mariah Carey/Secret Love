[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen, come on, come on, come on
Ladies and gentlemen
Mariah, Mariah
Ladies and gentlemen

[Chorus]
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

[Verse 1]
It was a summer's day
You went walking by
She didn't notice as you turned
And you discreetly winked your eye
And I remembered you
From back in the day
You were the boy I couldn't breathe without
The one that got away

[Chorus]
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

[Verse 2]
Now that I found you
How can I let you go?
You know I got my man at home
But baby, I still need ya so
And I know you ain't
Never leaving that girl
But every time you touch me, baby
It feels so incredible

[Chorus]
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby
Secret lovers
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

[Outro]
Oh baby, oh baby
