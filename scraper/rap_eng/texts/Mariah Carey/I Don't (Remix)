[Intro]
Ladies & Gentlemen!

[Hook: YG]
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
But I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was... blind
You kept playin' with my... mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and...
Rear view, bye

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't

[Verse 2: Remy Ma]
Remy Ma
You go hard for them
You don't ever ever wanna be apart from them
It's like I won, and you become a part of them
You hold them soft and still go hard for them
But instead of lookin' at how far we've come
I'm regrettin' it, damn, are you done?
Wanted kids and thought you fathered them
Now? I wouldn't even bother, hon
You see I never had a clue that harm would come
And I really loved you and now I'm done
See I got my car and it's started up
And I'll be long gone when your karma come
Had me believe I was wife
I really thought this was life
But now I'm finished, it's back to business
Remy Ma

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't

[Hook: YG]
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah

[Verse 3: YG]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, I just got you ring, for what?
I put you in the game, now it's game over
Every time you went to the Louis store you got chauffeured
Hold up, how you gon' leave that?
Hold up, give me my ring back
Never mind, you can keep that
'Cause every time you look at your ring, me, you gon' dream that

[Hook: YG]
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't
