[Pre-Chorus]
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
To save us all from Satan's power
When we had gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy

[Pre-Chorus]
God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day

[Chorus]
To save us all from Satan's power
When we had gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
