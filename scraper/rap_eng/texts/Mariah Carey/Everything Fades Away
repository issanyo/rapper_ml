[Verse 1]
Baby, don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me
Tonight, tonight
Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby I don't want you anymore

[Chorus]
Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby... no, no, no

[Verse 2]
Don't tell me
You're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh don't beg for mercy
Tonight, tonight
Cause I can't take any more
Just turn around
Don't break me down
Baby I don't love you like before

[Chorus]
Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby

[BRIDGE]
So hard for me to let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby give me one more chance
I know that we can make amends
Just let me love you one more time
(Don't say it)
Or I am gonna lose mind
(Don't say it babe)
So hard for me to let you go
So hard for me to let you go

[Chorus]
Let it all (why don't you?) fade away
Love is gone
The love is gone baby
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, babe
Nothing ever stays the same

Let it all fade away
Love is gone
The love is gone baby
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same.. baby..

It only fades
It only fades
It only fades
It only fades

Baby don't tell me you miss me you love me

It only fades
It only fades
It only fades
It only fades

Baby don't tell me you miss me you love me...
