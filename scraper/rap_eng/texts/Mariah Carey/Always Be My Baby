[Verse 1]
We were as one, babe, for a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting that you would always be mine
Now you want to be free, so I'll let you fly
Because I know in my heart, babe, our love will never die

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me, and I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me?
Oh, darling because you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on, and time can't erase a feeling this strong
Oh, you'll never going to shake me
'Cause you'll always be my baby

[Verse 2]
I am not going to cry now, and I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, girl, I will not stand in your way, hey
But inevitably, you'll be back again
Because you know in my heart, babe, our love will never end

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me, and I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me?
Oh, darling because you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on, and time can't erase a feeling this strong
Oh, you'll never going to shake me
'Cause you'll always be my

[Bridge]
I know that you'll be back, girl
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
And I know that you'll, you'll be right back
Baby, believe me it's only a matter of time, time

[Chorus]
You'll always be a part of me, and I'm part of you indefinitely
Girl, don't you know you can't escape me?
Oh, darling because you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on, and time can't erase a feeling this strong
Oh, you'll never shake me 'cause you'll always be my baby
Oh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
Oh, you'll never shake 'cause you'll always be my baby

You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling because you'll always be my baby
(You and I) And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong (you and I)
No way you're never going to shake me (you and I)
Ooh, darling because you'll always be my baby

[Outro]
No way you're never going to shake me
No way you're never going to shake me
No way you're never going to shake me (you and I)
You and I - we'll always
