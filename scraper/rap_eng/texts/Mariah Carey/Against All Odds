[Verse 1: Shane]
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I standing taking every breath with you
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've got to face

[Verse 3: Mark]
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
See there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
When that's what I've got to face

[Outro: Mariah Carey & (Westlife)]
Take a good look at me now
Cause I'll still be standing here (Standing here)
And you coming back for me is against all odds
That's a chance I've got to take
(A chance I've got to take, got to take)
(Take a look at me now)
Take a look at me now
(Take a look at me now)
