[Intro]
Lord only knows
Why I love you so
You're a heartless man
I don't understand
Why you gotta be
Why do you need to be so cold?

[Chorus]
So cold, how can you be
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold

[Verse 1]
You play games with my mind
Cheat and lie time after time
And I know you'll never change
But I just can't break away

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why
I let you treat me the way you do
You're just no good for me
I wish I never fell for you
You are

[Chorus]
So cold, how can you be (oh, baby)
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold, so cold

[Verse 2]
So many times
You keep me waiting around endlessly
You just laugh as I drown in despair
Never a worry, never a care

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why
I let you hurt me the way you do
You've got a spell on me
I'm hopelessly in love with you
You are

[Chorus]
So cold, how can you be (how can you be?)
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
So cold, how can you be (how can you be so cold?)
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is on fire
But deep down inside you're so cold

[Bridge]
Made of stone
Oh, you're wicked to the bone
I give you my heart
You tear me apart
You're like a devil in (you're like a devil in) disguise
So cold

[Chorus]
So cold,  (how can you be?) how can you be (how can you be?)
So cold (I can't take it no more), so cruel to me?
Ice cold (no more), don't even feel
(I can't wait another day)
So cold, how can you be
So cold, so cruel to me?
(Baby, you're heartless)
Ice cold (so cold), don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
So cold, ice cold (oh, yeah)
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
