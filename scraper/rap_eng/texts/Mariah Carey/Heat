[Intro]
It's Mariah
(Heat, heat, heat)
(Heat, heat, heat)
(Heat, heat, heat)
(Heat, heat, heat)
(Heat, heat, heat, aah)
They said I couldn't come no harder (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat, don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
They said I couldn't, they said I couldn't (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, aah)

[Verse 1]
I see you with your favorite dress on again
I guess you thought that you were slick
But I already peeped
You got your tag tucked in
Your strugglin'
Tryin' to look cute in your best friend's boots
But they don't hardly fit
Why you back again?
Tryin' to steal my man
I told you once before, but you don't know me

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

[Chorus]
You think I won't come out
These heels and make it clear, ho?
(I ain't the one)
You think I won't fuck up my hair and take it, bitch?
I ain't the one
Keep your hands off of my boo
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do (Hey)
What makes you think you fly enough to take my man, no?

[Post-Chorus]
Sho' ain't the one (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Sho' ain't the one (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I ain't the one

[Verse 2]
All these J-O's want what's mine
But they done lost they minds
They on him like the ice-cream man (Oh)
Night and day (Oh)
Why I gotta fight to keep 'em all away? (All away)
They crammin' but they know
They can't have none
Obsessin', but they messin'
With the wrong one

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

[Chorus]
You think I won't come out
These heels and make it clear, ho?
(I ain't the one)
You think I won't fuck up my hair and take it, bitch?
I ain't the one
Keep your hands off of my boo
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do (Hey)
What makes you think you fly enough to take my man, no?

[Bridge]
They said I couldn't come no harder (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat, don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
They said I couldn't come no harder (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat, don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
They said I couldn't come no harder (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat, don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
They said I couldn't they said I couldn't (Heat, heat, heat, heat)
Can't sleep on this heat don't bother (Heat, heat, heat, aah)

[Chorus]
You think I won't come out (You think I won't)
These heels and make it clear, ho?
(I ain't the one)
You think I won't (I won't) fuck up my hair and take it, bitch?
(I ain't the one)
Keep your hands off of my boo (Hands off of my boo)
Ain't no tellin' what I'll do (What I'll do)
(Hey)
What makes you think you (What I'll do)
Fly enough to take my man, no? (What I'll do, ooh)
I ain't the one

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Sho' ain't the one
(Oh, ho-oh, ho-oh, oh) Sho' ain't the one
(Oh, ho-oh, ho-oh, oh) You ain't the one

[Outro]
With my man I'mma be the one
Who wanna touch?
Sho' ain't the one
(No, no) Sho' ain't the one
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Sho' ain't the one
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Sho' ain't the one
