[Verse 1: Khel]
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
Because you've flown away, so far away

[Verse 2: Katrina]
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

[Chorus: All]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

[Verse 3: Bugoy/Katrina]
Darling, I never showed you (I never showed you)
Assumed you'd always be there (always there)
(I thought you'd always be there)
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (yeahhhh)

[Chorus: All]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day

[Bridge: Daryl/Katrina]
(Although the sun will never shine the same)
(I'll always look to a brighter day) Yeah yeahhhhh
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

[Chorus: All]
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (one sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (yes, we will)
(One sweet day) One sweet day

[Outro: Katrina]
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
