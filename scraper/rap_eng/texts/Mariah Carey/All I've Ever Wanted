[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I feel for you
If you only lived for me
The way I lived for you
I'd be in heaven
My dreams would come true

[Chorus]
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

[Verse 2]
If you were my own
To caress and hold
I would shower you with love
And drown within your soul
'Cause I live and breathe for you
And I really need to know

[Chorus]
That all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you

[Verse 3]
Everything I do is for you
You are every part of me
And I don't want to face
Another day
Alone
Without your love

[Chorus]
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you
All I've ever wanted
Is you
Is you
You
