[Intro]
The way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway

[Verse 1]
They'll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won't be about who is wrong, who is right
Like fireflies, emanating the light
Just you and I, universally tied
There's truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly, gotta have no fear

[Pre-Chorus 1]
First they love you, like oh it’s just you and
Then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (We do)
Remember there's only one you (Oh)
There's a God up above you (You)
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

[Chorus]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah yeah yeah
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Verse 2]
There's a better color that reflects the love you have inside
And you will discover there is solace though you're terrified
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly, you’ve got to have no fear

[Pre-Chorus 2]
First they love you, and then they judge you and
Try and chain you, and then they drain you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (We do)
Remember there’s only one you (Ooh)
There's a God up above you (True)
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

[Chorus]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah yeah yeah
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Bridge]
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway

[Chorus]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway
Runway
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Outro]
The way it feels to fly
