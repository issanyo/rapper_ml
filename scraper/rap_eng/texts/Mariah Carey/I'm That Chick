[Intro]
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee

[Verse 1]
Take this seriously
Like Pac, all eyez on me
That's right, you are intrigued
I'm that chick you like
You know this
What it be
I'm like the lottery
Hot Bentley with the keys
Take me for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Light in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

[Chorus]
I'm like that ooh wee
You're fiend to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

[Post-Chorus]
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like

[Verse 2]
I do's it naturally
Hypnotize, like Biggie
But you ain't having dreams
I'm that chick you like
Nah, you ain't seeing things
Or hallucinating
I brings that levity
Take me for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Light in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days

[Chorus]
I'm like that ooh wee
You're fiend to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

[Post-Chorus]
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like

[Bridge]
Boy, just relax
And unwind
Pull me in and breathe, once you do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you
Ain't no rules
It's time
Just keep on kissing me
Hold on and baby, we could party all night through the night
All right

[Chorus]
I'm like that ooh wee
You're fiend to blaze up
And taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like

[Post-Chorus]
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like
La da da, ooh we-ee
I'm that chick you like

[Outro]
I'm like that uptown haze
Them real thugs blaze
We'll touch the sky
'Cause I'm that chick you like
Uh-huh!
