[Intro: Ashanti, Natasha Bedingfield, and Nicole Scherzinger]
Everything will be alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Carrie Underwood]
The heart is stronger than you think
Like it can go through anything
And even when you think it can't, it finds a way
To still push on, though
Sometimes you want to run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain
And if you don't believe it, look into your heart
The beat goes on

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna, Sheryl Crow, Beyoncé]
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle?
You need to know

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow with Beyoncé]
If the mind keeps thinking
You've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you
Don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering
What is what?
Don't give up
Through it all, just stand up

[Verse 2: Fergie & Leona Lewis]
It's like we all have better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean it got to take control, no
[Leona Lewis & Keyshia Cole]
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playin' you
And sayin' you can't go on

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Miley Cyrus]
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust if off, don't let up
[LeAnn Rimes & Natasha Bedingfield]
Don't you know you can go be your own miracle?
[Carrie Underwood]
You need to know

[Chorus: All (Melissa Etheridge)]
If the mind keeps thinking
You've had enough (Oh, had enough)
But the heart keeps telling you
Don't give up (Don't you give up)
Who are we to be questioning, wondering
What is what? (What? What?)
Don't give up (Don't give up, just stand up)
Through it all, just stand up (Just stand up)

[Refrain: All (Melissa Etheridge)]
Through it all, just stand up (Just stand up)

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Ciara (Rihanna & Carrie Underwood)]
You don't gotta be a prisoner in your mind
If you fall, dust it off, you can live your life
(Yeah) Let your heart be your guide
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Mariah Carey & Ashanti]
And you will know that you're good if you trust in the good
Everything will be alright, yeah
Light up the dark if you follow your heart
[Mary J. Blige & Mariah Carey]
And it will get better
Through whatever

[Chorus: All]
If the mind keeps thinking
You've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you
Don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering
What is what?
Don't give up
Through it all, just stand up

[Chorus: All]
If the mind keeps thinking
You've had enough
But the heart keeps telling you
Don't give up
Who are we to be questioning, wondering
What is what?
Don't give up
Through it all, just stand up

[Outro: Fergie]
You got it in you, find it within'
You got it in now, find it within' now
You got it in you, find it within'
You got it in now, find it within' now
You got it in you, find it within'
You got it in now, find it within' now
Find it within' you, find it within'

[Refrain: All]
Through it all, just stand up
