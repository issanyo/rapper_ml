[Pre-Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus]
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town

[Verse 1]
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice

[Chorus]
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town

[Verse 2]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Pre-Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus]
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town

[Verse 3]
The kids in girl and Boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland
All around the Christmas tree

[Pre-Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

[Chorus]
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town
Santa clause is coming' to town
