[Intro]
Hey baby it won't end, won't end, won't end
Let's talk about love
This is my love story

[Verse 1]
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire
Off they go roller coaster ride
Up and down and around, twisted all out they minds
And then his friends
Said "It's too soon to settle down"
And then her friends
Said "He's a playa, slow it down"
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love
Wasn't on they side
But this isn't

[Chorus]
Just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie... no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby
There's no end to our love story

[Verse 2]
Chapter two
When they meet up again
Second time around
See, but they're just friends
But the feeling's still strong
And it's been too long
To be tripping like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like
Ay bay bay
Let's meet up today
Gots about an hour or two
You might as well come through
We can make it like it was
Just the two of us
Back up on that roller coaster
Like we been supposed to
'Cause this isn't

[Chorus]
Just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie... no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby

[Bride]
Just when it seemed like all the odds were stacked against them
They came back stronger than before, matter fact than some
Stronger than pride, looking like them
Looking like her, looking like him
Stronger than hate and the whole world too
Looking like me, looking like you

[Chorus]
Just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie... no
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby
