[Verse 1]
The wind has taken you
You're free finally at peace
So still you lie
Leaving your cares behind

[Verse 2]
The pain is gone
Gone with the spirit in your eyes
Now you're wandering around
Above us
Looking downward
As we cry

[Verse 3]
You've flown into the wind
Escaping all the hurt within
Took to
To the sky
Leaving the world behind

[Chorus]
So young to die
How could you let it all pass you by

[Verse 4]
And to the wind go so many dreams
That you held inside
Now you're just a memory
Burning in my mind

[Chorus]
And now you'll never know I loved you
And now you'll never know I cared

[Outro]
I really loved you
And now you'll never know
You'll only fade
Into the wind
