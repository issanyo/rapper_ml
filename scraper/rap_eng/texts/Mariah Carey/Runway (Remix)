[Intro: Mariah Carey]
The way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
They’ll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won’t be about who is wrong, who is right
Like fireflies, emanating the light
Just you and I, universally tied
There’s truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly, gotta have no fear

[Pre-Chorus 1: Mariah Carey]
First they love you, like oh it's just you and
Then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down (We do)
Remember there’s only one you (Oh)
There’s a God up above you (You)
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah yeah yeah
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Verse 2: KOHH]
身内で集まり
丘の上でするパーティ
プールとジャグジー付き
裸の女の子たち
あの子の肌白い
チャリ漕ぎまくり
アルコール, ガス, 吊し
もう何でも在り, okay

[Pre-Chorus 2: KOHH]
全員がブッとんでる
普通ってなんだっけ？
ドンペリ開くシャンペン
会計50万円
それ以上為る此のチェーン
VVSのfake
貧乏人みたいな服で
贅沢する超豪勢

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah yeah yeah
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway
Runway, runway
Let love be your runway

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway
Runway
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
