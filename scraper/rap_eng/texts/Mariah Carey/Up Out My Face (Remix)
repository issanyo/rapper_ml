[Intro: Mariah Carey & Nicki Minaj (Spoken)]
It's not chipped, we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered
Mariah... Hey-ey
Young Money! Hey-ey
Nicki Minaj! Hey-ey
You're such a Barbie!

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, Mariah I was in them million dollar meetings, he was cheatin'
All up in the church, he was sneaking with the deacon
Cats away, well the mice'll play
LOL, smiley face, have a nice day
Cause pop, pop, pop, there goes my rubber band
So stop, stop, stop sniffing that contraband
Cause you was penny pinching, my accounts laced
Attention! About face

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I thought we had something special, like we had something good
But I should have had another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by you, boy, don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa and I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster, see me at a show
But you won't see me for free, boy, this ain't no promo

[Bridge]
In all shame now
Where ever you been laying, you can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ and pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your mama's house

[Chorus]
When I break, I break boy
[Up out my face boy] [x4]
When I break
[Up out my face boy] [x4]
When I break

[Verse 3]
You ain't never gonna feel this thing again
You gon' get alot of calls cause I CC-ed all your friends
(Laugh)
I ain't walking around no more
Feeling sad, that ain't even my bad baby
I break, when I break, I break
Mariah

[Verse 4]
So look who's crying now, boo-hoo-hoo
Talking 'bout you missing your boo, hoo-hoo
Oh, no, you ain't getting it
I know you ain't hitting it
No, you ain't a rapper, so you need to stop spitting it
Ha ha ha ha ha
You wondering who I'm messing while you ain't next to me
Ha ha ha ha ha
So pay the consequences cause you acted all ignorant

[Bridge]

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, styling on them big B's, bought the Benz out
Elevator, press P for the penthouse
Top doe's, then we break like tacos
Roscoe's, on his knees with a snot-nose
They be like, "She next!", Kawasaki T-Rex
Give em' some Kleenex, match his little V-Necks
Oh, that's what he left? Let his mama pick it up
Might back up on it, VROOM VROOM, with the pick-up truck
That blue and yellow, yeah, that's the Carmelo Jag
I bob and weave em', hit em' wit that Mayweather jab
I get the thumbs up like I'm hailing a yellow cab
My flow nuts like M&M's in the yellow bag
Mariah

[Verse 6]
When I break I break I break
And no super glue can fix this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a welder and a builder could rebuild this shit
When I break I break I break
Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic
Can fix this when I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again
When I break [Laughs]
Up out my face boy

[Verse 7: Nicki Minaj in the background]
Better go back to you mama's house
I told you, I put, I put his stuff on the sidewalk
I will roll over every nook and cranny with a pickup truck like
Like straight up and down I am Nicki Minaj can't say "ask about me"
Young Money
