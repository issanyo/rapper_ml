[Verse 1]
Lying beside you, you're in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?
We sailed on together, we drifted apart
And here you are by my side

[Chorus]
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms

[Verse 2]
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

[Chorus]
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms, arms
