[Verse 1]
Lying beside you
This joy is so deep
I reach out and touch you
Tenderly
Looking inside you
My world is complete
I struggled to find you
Now I'm free

[Bridge]
Precious love
Burning so deeply
Shining completely
For you

[Chorus]
So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now
Is all I need

[Verse 2]
Adrift in the moment
So sacred and pure
Alive for you only
I am yours
As you touch me so sweetly
And you whisper my name
I feel how you love me
We are the same

[Bridge]
Precious one
Don't ever leave me
Forever need me
This way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Stay with me
Beyond the end
I treasure you
Cause you made me whole again

[Chorus]
