[Intro]
Joy to the world
For he has come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing

[Verse 1]
Joy to the earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

[Chorus]
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

[Verse 2]
He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

[Chorus]
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

[Outro]
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
