[Verse 1]
Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
A picture fades of you and I together
I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye

[Chorus]
Did you really care, care at all for me?
Did you really care, did you care at all for me?

[Verse 2]
A displaced little girl wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you'd materialize
She pressed on night and day to keep on living
And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive

[Chorus]
Did you really care, care enough for me?
Did you really care, did you care at all for me?

[Bridge]
If I'm not quite good enough
Or somehow undeserving of a mother's love
You could have had the decency to give me up
Before you gave me life

[Chorus]
Don't you even care, just the slightest little bit, for me?
'Cause I really need to feel you cared
Even once upon a time for me
I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me
I need to understand why you left me there so helplessly
Don't you even care, care at all for me?

[Outro]
Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
