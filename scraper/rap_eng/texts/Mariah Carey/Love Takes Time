[Verse 1]
I had it all but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone

[Bridge]
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside

[Chorus]
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there alone
