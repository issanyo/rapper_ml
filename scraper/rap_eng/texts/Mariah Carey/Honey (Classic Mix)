Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
Everytime you call me I'll come running
Cause what you got is far beyond compare

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

I can't be elusive with you honey
Cause it's blatant that I've feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
Cause you're the only thing I wanna do

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin for ya, cryin for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside

[Incomprehensible]

Honey, honey

It's like honey, it's like honey
It's like honey, it's like honey

And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin', don't you see
Every night and day I can hardly wait for another taste of honey

It's like honey really washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya

One hit of your love addicted me
