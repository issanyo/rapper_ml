[Verse 1]
I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA "I cut you off" (No)
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with 'I'm sorry', but I'm sorry, (No)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, (No)
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no

[Verse 2]
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no
I said no
(I said no)
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no, I said no-no
No, no
No

[Bridge: Notorious B.I.G.]
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)
He's a slut, he's a hoe, he's a freak
Got a different girl every day of the week (Check it)

[Chorus]
I said no
(I said no)
A no-no
(Look)
I said no-no
That's a no-no
(I said no)
No, no
I said no-no
(No)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
(And I said no)
(No, no, no)

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Parlez-vous français? I said non
Lemme translate it, I said no
I can say it en español
No
(No no no no)
Portuguese for you não
Japanese for you (iie)
(I said no)
(I said it)
(I said no)
I said no

I think, I think that was it
Yep
