We were real tight
Though at times we would fuss and fight
Still found the time to hang out all night

We would tell the dozens
Laughing out at our lies
Alibies that made up for hard times

At times I’d go to you for advice
You’d always let me inside your life
To tell me things will be alright

I saw an angel appear
I watched its beautiful metaphor
And whispered took you all so gently

I’ll be holding on

There were times we would argue
And mess things up
No matter how bad things worked out

It’s not the same without seeing your smile
Having your spirit to hold on to
And I’m still missing having you around

Missing your personality light up a room
You’re face shining brightly with wings before noon
Between two ponds you found the route to heaven

I’ll be holding on

Your death in return ripped my heart at the seems
I would have given you the world and asked for nothing
The candle captures the wind in your memory

To those words as beautiful as mine
The lost lessons learned
Are a bitter cry for truth

I write the passion for loving you
To have loved someone
I will fight for memories to remain

As the bitter sweet words that stain on this page
You are forever in my memory

I’ll keep holding on
