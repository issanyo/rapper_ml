[Intro]
I... I... I
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)

[Hook]
I, I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you

[Verse 1]
You ain't even gotta worry, about a thing
I gotcha, babe
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game, I'm here to stay
See, our love is stronger than any drug
Addictive, just can't get enough
And every time I'm with you, I want some more
Just close the door, and let's explore each other

[Chorus]
Long as I know you got me
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (ooh)

[Verse 2]
Don't care what no one has to say
They don't understand us like we do
I need you near me night and day
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do
Scoop me up and we can go
To that little spot where no one knows
Spend a little time, just us alone
You can caress my body and never let go, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Long as I know you got me (I'll be)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)
There's no stopping you and me (no no, no no, you and me)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (I'll be)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (oh oh)

[Bridge]
I don't want another, ain't gon' never be another
Can't nobody do what you do to me (nobody)
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another (no)
Can't nobody do what you do to me (can't nobody love me)
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another (like you do)
Can't nobody do what you do to me (hey!)
I'll be lovin' you long (as I can breathe) (I'll be lovin' you)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (long as I can breathe!)

[Chorus]
Long as I know you got me (long as you got me)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (ah, I)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (I'll be lovin' you long long time)
There's no stopping you and me (no no no no no, no no no, love you long time)
I'll be lovin' you long time (as I can breathe) (I...)
I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally) (gonna love you long time!)

[Hook]
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)) (ooh, ooh)
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (ooh ooh)

I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally))
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)) (long time)
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you (I'll be lovin' you long time (eternally)) (I'll be lovin' you)
