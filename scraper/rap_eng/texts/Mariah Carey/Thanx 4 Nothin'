[Intro]
Oh, this is dedicated to all the ladies out there
Who's tired of getting played
You know, you know this is (y'all know this is), so, so def
(I ain't gotta say it)
And your girl ain't me
Thanks for nothing (MC)
You were just playing a game

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanks for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Yeah, you know the feeling)
You were just playing a game

[Verse 1]
I can't even know what to say
I've been hurt, I've been played and I'm so shamed
I can't even cry, it's that deep
You just lie and you cheat like it's nothing
See, you said that you loved me too
And so I trusted you
But I guess that subconsciously I knew
But I didn't wanna face the truth
That I was only being used
And you was just fronting
Hey, boy, thanks for nothing

[Chorus]
I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm brokenhearted and shattering
'Cause you were just playing a game
Nothing anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playing a game

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanks for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playing a game

[Verse 2]
Every day and every night, I stay by the phone
Never go no place so, just in case you call, I'll be home
Seems like what I do is think about our pseudo romance
While you're somewhere burning diesel
In the streets, having laughs
Somebody say: "You know what I'm going through
You been left with nothing too
Too much you can't count on one hand
Singing three, four, five, six
Seven days a week you're drowning in tears
He was so insincere, now you're laying up in bed
Every night singing: Hey boy, thanks for nothing"

[Chorus]
I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm brokenhearted and shattering
'Cause you were just playing a game
Nothing anyone could to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playing a game

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So thanks for nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You were just playing a game
Thanks for nothin'
