[#Beautiful]
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh, how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere

‘Cause it’s beautiful
Oh, you make me feel undressable
And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Breakdown]
You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me

Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
Because I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry

[I Know What You Want]
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
And give ya my love and cry with you

I will climb a mountain high aha
Until I was up to touch the sky
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be

Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
I know what you want
You know I got it
Baby if you give it to me
I'll give it to you
As long as you want
You know I got it

[It's Like That]
I came to have a party
Open off the Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watching me
So what's it going to be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feeling me

Because it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

Everybody is living it up
All the fellows keep looking at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

Because it's
Because it's
Because it's

[Crybaby]
When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby I cry

Okay, so it's 5 am and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number, got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called
To say you're trying to reach me
Probably because you see that I'm with someone new

Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby over you and me

I don't get no sleep
I'm up awake
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
And could have been so perfect
Still I cry, I cry, I cry
Oh I gotta get me some sleep
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry

[The Roof]
It wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely a little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding (pounding)
My inner voice resounding (resounding)
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you
(And I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

And so we finished the Moet
And started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
(You took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time (And I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night

Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words "I love you, boy"
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye

[Obsessed]
All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this
You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?

[Don't Forget About Us]
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that baby

Now every time I see you I pretend I'm fine
When I want to reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us

And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do like me, she'll never be MC
Baby don't you, don't you forget about us

Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
