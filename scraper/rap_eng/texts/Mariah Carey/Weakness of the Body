[Verse 1]
I know I hurt you so
The night you heard my true confession, boy
I had to let you know
I spent a night of guilty passion so
I called to say
There'll never be another to take your place, no
Now I pray that'll you put an end
To these tears of shame rolling down my face

[Chorus]
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
Weakness of the body, body

[Verse 2]
It didn't mean a thing
I guess I needed to prove my love was true
I had to feel the sting
Of a night in another's arms away from you
Now I'm lying
Staring at the ceiling held in my pain
Now I'm crying
I turned our days of sunshine
Into these days and nights of rain

[Chorus]
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
Weakness of the body
Gotta have your love
Weakness of the body, body

[Spoken Bridge]
Every morning I wake up and remember you're gone
I look in the mirror and ask myself why did I did you so wrong
Now I feel the love that burns so hot inside
Just trust me one more time
And I promise to make you happy

[Bridge]
I called to say
There'll never be another to take your place
Now I pray that'll you put an end
To these tears of shame rolling down my face

[Chorus]
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you, yeah
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you, got to, got to have you
Weakness of the body
Weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart...
