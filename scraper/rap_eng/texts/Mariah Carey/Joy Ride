[Chorus]
Our love goes 'round, our love goes 'round
Our love goes 'round and 'round
(On a joy ride, on a joy ride)
With you babe, with you, babe
With you babe, with you, baby

[Verse 1]
Baby baby, don't you ever let go
More and more until we both overflow
Got a feeling that my heart's never known
(I found love)
Tender kisses and I'm floating on air
You can have me anytime, anywhere
When you need me, I will always be there
(I found love)

[Chorus]
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was Heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love

[Verse 2]
Loving you is like a taste of Heaven
Wanna gaze into your eyes forever
Run away and spend our lives together
(I found love)
Baby baby, all it takes is one touch
And immediately I feel a rush
Baby boy, too much is never enough
(I found love)

[Chorus]
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love

[Bridge]
I don't need anything, when you're here next to me
Nobody in this whole wide world
Could ever replace you in my eyes
We found paradise, forever you and I, yeah

[Chorus]
Our love goes 'round, our love goes 'round
Our love goes 'round and 'round (On a joy ride, on a joy ride)
With you babe, with you, babe
With you babe, with you, baby
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was Heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love

[Outro]
Baby, baby, baby, we found love
