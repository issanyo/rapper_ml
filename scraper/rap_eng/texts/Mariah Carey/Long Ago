[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairy tales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace

[Chorus]
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away (now is all so far, so far)
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fool's paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I need you now (I need you, baby, right now)
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

[Chorus]
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away (now is all so far)
But you still haunt me
(You still haunt me, you still haunt me, yes you do, baby)
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me (haunt me)
Take me back to yesterday

So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby I need you now (Oh, I need you right now, boy)
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me

[Chorus]
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
So long ago
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
