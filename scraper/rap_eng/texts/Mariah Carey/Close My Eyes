[Verse 1]
I was wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know

[Chorus]
But I close my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up a little too soon

[Verse 2]
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget

[Chorus]
As I close my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up a little too soon

[Bridge]
Nearing the edge
Oblivious, I almost fell right over
A part of me will never be quite able to feel stable
That woman-child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I woke up in time, time, time

[Verse 3]
Guardian angel, I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
(You're always alive)

[Chorus]
As I close my eyes (Close my eyes)
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up a little too soon
