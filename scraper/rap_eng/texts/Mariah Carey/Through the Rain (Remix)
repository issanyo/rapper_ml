[Intro: Joe]
Gotta just stand up and say the rain ain't gonna melt me away

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
When you get caught in the pouring rain with nowhere to run
Without anyone
And you get a little frightened 'cause you lost your way home
But through all the thunder and lightning
Just keep praying and keep
Saying to yourself (yes I can, yes I can)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey With Joe]
I can make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough, and in time, I can make
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
Another day longer and I'll make it through the rain

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, if you keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail (Yes I can, yes I can)
Once you say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I can make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough, and in time, I can make
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
Another day longer and I'll make it through the rain
Oh, whoa, whoa
There are times in your life when you feel you can't keep going
But keep holding, keep holding
Oh, whoa
There are times in your life when you
Feel like the world all around you
Has shattered, but know that you can't be broken
Don't be afraid, stand tall and say
Don't be afraid, Don't be afraid,Don't be afraid
Stand tall and say (Yes I can, yes I can)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Joe]
I can make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough, and in time, I can make
(And I live again)
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
Another day longer and I'll make it through the rain
Oh, whoa, whoa

[Outro: Mariah Carey & Joe]
Yes I can, yes I can
I'll make it through the rain
I'll stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong and in time
I can mend
(Yes I can, yes I can)
When I'm afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
Live another day longer
And I make it through the rain
(Yes I can, yes I can)
