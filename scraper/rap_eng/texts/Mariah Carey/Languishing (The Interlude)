[Intro]
If you could only see
That I was not put here for you
To judge me and dispute my innermost truth
And after all these years of enmity, envy, and tears
It's a shame you don't know me at all

[Verse 1]
I was wondering
Would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?

[Verse 2]
Those ancient buried recollections
We transform them and select them
You have yours
I have mine
That's fine

[Verse 3]
While we're too torn to heal
Our stitch has never disappeared
I have mine
You have yours
I'm sure

[Verse 4]
I was wondering
Would you reach for me
If you saw that I was languishing?
I was wondering, would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?
