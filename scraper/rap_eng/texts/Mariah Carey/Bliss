[Intro]
Touch me, baby
It feels so amazing (Yeah)
And you stimulate me
And you make me want you more and more

[Verse 1]
What do I do, what do I say?
Does it feel good, to you this way?
I wanna be, all that you need
Boy, what's your fantasy?
Better hold on, ready or not
Baby, my love ain't gonna stop
Take it down low, make me get high

[Chorus]
Ooh, my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My, my, my, my loving goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
See, all my love's for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, don't you rush me, no
You gotta take it slow
Just let the feeling grow
Until it overflows
Anyway you want it now
Just gotta tell me how
To give you everything
You've even dared to dream

[Verse 3]
Isn't it bliss, to you right now?
Don't be subdued, say it out loud
Ain't it a sweet, luscious delight? (Sweet)
When you're immersed in my
Ocean of love, coming on strong (Coming on)
Baby, I've been waiting so long (Strong)
Revel inside of paradise

[Chorus]
Ooh, my love goes
On and on and on and on and on (Yes)
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My, my, my, my loving goes
On and on and on and on and on
My love goes
On and on and on and on and on

[Verse 4]
So
Gimme some pure (Gimme some pure)
Delectable love (Delectable love)
Like I'm gonna give to you (I'm gonna give it to you)
Keep coming around (Keep coming around)
'Cause I won't run out ('Cause I won't run out)
I can't get enough of you, my love goes on

[Chorus]
Ooh, my love goes
On and on and on and on and on
My, my, my, my loving goes
On and on, on and on, on and on (My love goes)
My, my love goes on
My, my, my, my loving goes
On and on and on and on and on (On, on, on)
