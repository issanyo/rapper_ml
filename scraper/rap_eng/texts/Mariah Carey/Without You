[Verse 1]
No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know

[Chorus]
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

[Verse 2]
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow show
Yes, it shows

[Chorus]
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
(No, can't live)
(No, I can't live)
No, no, no, no, hey
I can't live (no, can't live)
If living is without you
(No, I can't live)
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live (no, can't live, no, I can't live)
