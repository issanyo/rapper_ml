[Verse 1]
When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

[Verse 2]
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

[Bridge]
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say

[Chorus]
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again

[Outro]
And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh, yes, you can
You're gonna make it through the rain
