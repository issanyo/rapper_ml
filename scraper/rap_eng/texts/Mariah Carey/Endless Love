[Verse 1: Luther Vandross]
My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

[Chorus 1: Luther Vandross & Mariah Carey]
And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh yes
You will always be
My endless love

[Verse 3: Luther Vandross & Mariah Carey]
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
And forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

[Chorus 2: Luther Vandross & Mariah Carey]
And love
I'd play the fool
For you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
'Cause baby
You mean the world to me
I know I've found in you
My endless love

[Chorus 3: Luther Vandross & Mariah Carey]
And love I'll play the fool
For you
I'm sure
That you know I don't mind
'Cause baby
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
My endless love
