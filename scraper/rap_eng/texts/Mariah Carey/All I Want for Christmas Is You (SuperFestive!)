[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I just can't wait, yeah

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I don't want a lot for Christmas, there is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, you, baby

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas, I won't even wish for snow
And I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you, you baby

[Bridge: Justin Bieber & Mariah Carey]
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need? Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Justin Bieber]
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own, for my own baby
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you baby

[Outro until Fade: Justin Bieber]
It's all I want for Christmas baby
It's all I want for Christmas
It's all I want baby, yeah yeah
Woah, woah woah woah woah, ooh baby
