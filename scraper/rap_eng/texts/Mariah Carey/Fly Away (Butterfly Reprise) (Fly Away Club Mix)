Don't be afraid to fly
Spread your wings
Open up the door
So much more outside

Don't be afraid to fly
Come spread your wings
Spread your wings and see the light inside
Fly, just fly
Don't be afraid
Don't let your spirit die
She says

"Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly"

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

Don't be afraid to fly
Don't be afraid to just fly
You, you've become a butterfly
Don't be afraid to just fly

Butterfly
Feel it fly
Fly away
Far far

Feel it fly

Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly

For you have become a butterfly
