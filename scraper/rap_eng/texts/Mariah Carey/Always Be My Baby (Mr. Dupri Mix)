[Intro : Da Brat]
I got one for the money
I got two for the bass
I got three to get you goin' baby
Cause da brats in da place
And it don't stop and it don't quit
Like that and it don't stop
And it don't quit like that

[Hook : Xscape]
Do do doop do do do dot dot do dow
Do dot do  do do do dot dot do dow
Do do do do do do dot dot do dow
Do dot dow do do do dot dot do dow

[Verse 1 : Mariah]
We were as one baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
Cause I know in my heart baby
Our love will never die

[Chorus : Xscape]
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinetly
Boy don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby

[Hook : Xscape]

[Verse 2 : Mariah]
I ain't gonna cry no
And I won't beg you to stay
If your determine to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
Cause you know in your heart babe
Our love will never end

[Chorus]

[Bridge : Xscape & Mariah]
I know that you'll be back boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time

[Rap: Da Brat]
Who brings the ruckus and the pain like Meth
It's evident tha residents of So So Def
Got the industry on lock where
Outsiders can't enter
Ever since the arrival of this west side
Representer who rocks your musicbox
And break down your structure you
Fantasize as you visualize me as your dreamlover (WHOA!)
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face
Reality reason through mc's
Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary
I'm gettin' g's if you heard of me's
Then you know that we's makin' g's
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me
To tha back steady stacking papers smokin' on fat
Stacks of danks see to some
I'm a hero of this feel on file
But that's my style
And they don't pay me nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real
For my peeps in that street cause to them
I'mma always be their baby

[Mariah]
May we always be together
In the sands of time

[Hook]
