Love it when you call me baby

To the rhythm, rhythm, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Normani & Lauren]
Your name is written on my lips

I don't need to make a wish
'Cause all I want is you
When you do it like this
I just lose my cool

You make me get up, get up like this is my song
I'mma get up, get up, yeah, yeah
You got me humming, humming to the beat of the drum
