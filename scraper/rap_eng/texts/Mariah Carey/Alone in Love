[Chorus]
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

[Verse 1]
I look into your eyes
You turn the other way
And now I realize
It's all a game you play

[Verse 2]
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love

[Chorus]
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love

[Verse 3]
You haunt me in my dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
Your love is not the same

[Verse 4]
I figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love



[Verse 5]
Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it through the night
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours 'till the morning light

[Chorus]
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love
