Faces by Angela k brown

I am the voice
No one hears
No one listens
My voice carries
In the wind
But no one cares anymore
I feel rejected
I’m not corporate America
I’m not wealthy
I’m not the majority
So I don’t matter
I’m the transgendered
I’m the poor
I’m the uneducated
I’m the minority
I’m the immigrant
I'm the young woman
Whose voice is worthy
We once dreamed of a world
We once had
The land of the free
Free and equal for every race
Where everyone had a chance-at prosperity
My wish to humanity
Is that light shines once more
Before the candle wick burns out
And then darkness prevails
And we lose sight of our purpose
