Hello, hello, hello, hello...
Hello stranger, I'm mighty glad to see you
It's been a long long time (a long long time)
Things have changed
But the thought of your embrace
Lingered on my mind

There are words to say
That clear the way
And lead straight to your heart
You're overthinking that I'm only here to hurt you
That never crossed my mind

Still you're colder than an ice sea (baby, baby)
You're not your typical pisces
But listen, baby, you entice me
(Don't you see)
Invite me to your place
C'mon, c'mon
Stop giving me the feeling, girl
You're blocking what we're nearing
True love is never ending
Don't you want it, girl
Don't you want it, girl
Don't you want it, girl
(Not your typical pisces, hello...)

Hello stranger, I'm mighty glad to see you
Here stands a different man
I've settled down and matured a lot
I thought you'd understand

Still you're colder than an ice sea (baby, baby)
You're not your typical pisces
But baby, baby, you entice me
Invite me to your place, hey baby
Stop giving me the feeling, girl
You're blocking what we're nearing
True love is never ending
Don't you want it, girl
Don't you want it, girl
Don't you want it, girl
(Not your typical pisces, hello...)

It's been a long time since I saw you, baby
Never should have let you go
Looking in your eyes, like I'm hypnotized
Soon I'm here to serve your love

(You're not your typical pisces
You're colder than an ice sea...)
It's ok to love a stranger at your door
It's been a long time since i saw you baby
Never should have let you go

I wanna say
Hello, hello...
