[Intro]
Love you 'till the end of time
Baby, I will love you 'till the end of time

[Verse 1]
Close to me
Oh, I need you close to me
Loving me
Close to you
How can I get close to you?
Help me to

[Chorus]
Why can't you see?
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you 'till the end of time

[Verse 2]
I think of you
Every moment I go through
Thoughts of you
I dream of you
All I have are so many dreams of you
Won't you please come true?

[Chorus]
Oh, why can't you see?
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Oh, I'm so in need
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
I would love you 'till the end ('till the end)
'Till the end ('till the end) the end of time

[Bridge]
Tell me what you need
Let me give you all of me
Cause without you nothing's real
You're the reason that I feel
Tell me what you need
Let me give you everything
Every moment I'm alive
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
Oh, why, why can't you see?
I would give the world away
To have you by my side
Don't you know that I, I'm so in need?
Each and every night I pray
You'll come and save my life
Oh, I would love you 'till the end ('till the end)
'Till the end ('till the end) the end of time

[Outro]
Love you 'till the end of time
Baby, I will love you
'Till the end of time, 'till the end
Baby, I will love you 'till the end of time
Love you 'till the end of time
Baby, I will love you
Love you 'till the end of time
Baby, I will love you 'till the end of time
Love you 'till the end of time
