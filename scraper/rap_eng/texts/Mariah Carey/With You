[Intro]
Uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
With you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Mustard on that beat, ho

[Verse 1]
It was all so overwhelming
She was like, "I don't know, don't tell me"
He had eyes that said, "Girl, I'll save you"
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true

[Verse 2]
Waves were breakin' on that shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past four
Still I yearned to touch you more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"

[Chorus]
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (You, you)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm s'posed to do (Boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
And ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you (Aye)
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm s'posed to do (boy)
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
(With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you, you, you (Oh yeah)
With you, you, you (Oh yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, baby, I'm in love, it's true
