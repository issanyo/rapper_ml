[Intro]
Trembling
Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine

[Verse 1]
It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles went soaring above us and baby

[Chorus 1]
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay (Stay)
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

[Verse 2]
So starry eyed (So starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me (Swept over me)
Like the wind through the trees
I felt you sigh with a sweet intensity and baby

[Chorus 2]
Then you put your hand in mine (Hand in mine)
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze (Daze)
A crescent moon began to shine (Began to shine)
And I wanted to stay (Stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

[Bridge]
Thunder clouds (Thunder clouds)
Hung around (Hung around)
So threateningly (So threateningly)
Ominously hovering
And the sky (And the sky)
Opened wide
Showering
Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus 3]
Then you put your hand in mine (Put your hand in mine)
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)

[Outro]
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
