[Chorus 1]
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

[Verse 1]
Baby, no matter how long it be
We never lose that chemistry
And it's the strongest thing I've ever experienced
So sorry, whatever happened to empathy?
I know you motherfuckers feel like we
When you're messing with the one
True lover that make you O.O.C

[Chorus 2]
Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong, but eternally
I get so O.O.C
And that's just the way it be

[Chorus 1]
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

[Verse 2]
Baby, every time you touch me
Still get that electricity
And after all this time, it don't even make no sense
So s'cusa me, te quiero mucho papi
Je ne sais pas mais c'est la vie
When you're messing with the one
True lover that make you O.O.C

[Chorus 2]
Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong, but eternally
I get so O.O.C
And that's just the way it be

[Chorus 1]
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever
It's forever

[Bridge]
Hands in the air! (Let's work)
You're out of control (Let's work)
I'm out of control
Bounce on them, bounce on, just bounce on
Come on

[Chorus 2]
Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong, but eternally
I get so O.O.C
And that's just the way it be
Even though I've been gone for a minute
It's wrong I admit it
Your love's so addictive that
I get so O.O.C
Out of control, baby
Although we've both moved on to another
Still long for each other
It's wrong, but eternally
I get so O.O.C
And that's just the way it be
