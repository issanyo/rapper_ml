[Chorus]
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby now, I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)

[Interlude]
Maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I'm not gonna be a prisoner of your love
I know you're lying, denying all of your actions
So listen up cause here's my reaction

[Verse 1]
Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
You always tried so hard to keep me down
But now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations take you by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy
I see through your disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

[Chorus]
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, now I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)

[Verse 2]
No longer blind, I can focus on deception
Used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery
There's nothing you can hide
It's all definite
There's nothing you can tell me now
To change the way I feel inside

[Pre-Chorus]
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone

[Chorus]
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, now I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
(Not gonna be a prisoner)
I won't be the prisoner of your love, of your love
(Don't wanna be a prisoner, I don't wanna be a prisoner, no)
(Don't wanna be a prisoner, I don't wanna be a prisoner)

[Bridge]
So if you wanna be my love, you can't be a liar, play around
You see me and then say, "Mariah, I miss you"
Expect me to hug and kiss you
Don't mean to diss you
But I guess I'm not the kind of girl you thought I was
I've had enough and now I'll see you later 'cause
Boy, maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I won't be a prisoner, baby, of your love
(You don't think)
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more

[Chorus]
I won't be the prisoner of your love
(Prisoner of your love)
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
(Not gonna be a prisoner, not gonna be)
I won't be the prisoner of your love

[Outro]
I'm not one of those girls who'll wait around
Crying cause you're playing dirty all over the town
You can't do that, I'm not a doormat
You're just a player - that's not my format
See ya (prisoner of your love)
