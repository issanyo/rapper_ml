[Intro]
Call my phone
Baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Call my phone
Baby, call my phone
Baby, call my phone
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone

[Verse 1]
Lost without my other half
How can I live without ya?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe?
And everything is off, where are you?
Guess it's all my fault, lady sings the blues
No one could deny it, we were flying like United
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable

[Verse 2]
Got photos of us on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone (Hey)
Boy, I just can't erase 'em
The first text I ever got from ya still saved in my inbox
And I read it back time after time
Boy, I'm lost, can't you look?
Won't you please find me?
I'm down to my last tear, come rescue me
See, it's broken my heart to the point where I don't leave the house, no reason, weekends out just ain't the same without you
But I thought we were inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable

[Bridge]
It's been sixteen days since I held you tight
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night
Boy, I just wish you'd show up and make everything alright
So what you waitin' for?
'Cause both us have thought we're inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
(I know, I know, I know we are)
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
(I know, I know, I know we are)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
(Gotta pick the phone up, phone up)
(Gotta pick the phone up, phone up)
(Oh baby, I just gotta pick the phone, the phone, the phone)
