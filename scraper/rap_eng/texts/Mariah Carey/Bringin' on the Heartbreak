[Verse 1]
Gypsy sitting, looking pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin' for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry, but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Taking all the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Oh, can't you see?

[Chorus]
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see?

[Verse 2]
You're such a secret
Misty eyed and shady
Baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle
Your flame slowly fading
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see?
Just trying to say to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're bringin' on the heartache
Taking all the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Oh, can't you see?

[Chorus]
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringing' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see? Can't you see?

[Bridge]
No, no, no
Hey, babe
You got the best of me
Oh, can't you see? (Oh, can't you see?)
You got the best of me (You got the best of me)
Oh, can't you see? (Oh, can't you see?)

[Chorus]
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartbreak
(You're bringin' on the heartbreak)
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
(You're bringin' on, bringin' on)
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak (Can't you see?)
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
