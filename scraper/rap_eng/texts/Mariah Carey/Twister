[Verse 1]
She was kind of fragile
And she had a lot to grapple with
But basically she kept
It all inside

[Verse 2]
Childlike and effervescent
With a well of pain
The depth of I could not imagine
If I tried

Never thought that I
Would hear them say
Twister went and threw it all away

[Verse 3]
She was kind of magical
Her laughter sent you casually
Floating through a moment
Of release

[Verse 4]
Dear God, it's all so tragic
And I'll never have the chance
To feel the closure
That I ultimately need
No, I never dreamed
That there would come a time
Twister'd go and leave it all behind

[Bridge]
Lord I pray she's found some peace
And her soul's somewhere at ease

[Verse 5]
Yeah I'm feeling kind of fragile
And I've got a lot to handle
But I guess this is my way
Of saying goodbye
