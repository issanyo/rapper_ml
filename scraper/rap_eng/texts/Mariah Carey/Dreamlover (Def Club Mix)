I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that'll last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, oh baby

I needs a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights till the dawn
Why don't you take me away

Dreamlover, come rescue me take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now

'Cause I wanna share forever with you, babe

I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind, oh no, no

The kind of love that won't fly away
I just wasn't someone to belong to
Every day of my life always
So come and take me away
