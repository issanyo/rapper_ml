We're singing' deck the halls
It's not Christmas at all
Remember when you were here
And everything we had last year

All the church bells in town
They're ringing a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home

Now the snows coming down
And I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby, please come home

Pretty lights on a tree
I've been watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby, please come home

All the church bells in town
They're ringing a song
And its a happier song
Please, please come on

If there was a way
I could hold back these tears
But its Christmas day
Please come home

Home
Come home
Come home
Come home
Oh, Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

Now the snows coming down
And I'm watching it fall
Watching the people around
Baby, please come home

Pretty lights on a tree
I've been watching them shine
You should be here with me
Baby, baby come home

Come home
