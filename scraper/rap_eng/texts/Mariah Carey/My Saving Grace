[Verse 1]
I've still got a lot to learn
But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long (As I know all things are possible)
Just as long as I believe
Oh, yes

[Verse 2]
I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fears
With no end in sight
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

[Chorus]
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my saving grace within you

[Verse 3]
Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
Been destitute
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatized
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free

[Chorus]
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my saving grace within you

[Bridge]
And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you
For delivering me

[Verse 4]
And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
Always my saving grace
Pulls me through
I found my saving grace within you

[Outro]
(Yes you are - you're my every, everything)
Within you
(Only, only you)
Yes Lord
(Only you)
My saving grace Lord is
You
