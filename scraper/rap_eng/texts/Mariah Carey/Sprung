[Verse 1]
Babe, when you look my way
You keep on blowing my mind
You keep on making me high
Keep giving me butterflies
Every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See, I'm just breaking it down

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can't imagine, boy
I'm on a tangent

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's hard to make believe
This's just a casual thing
You’re so unnerving to me
Feels like I’m living a dream
Baby, please don't wake me up
I’m lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I’m right where I wanna be

[Pre-Chorus]
You got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can't imagine, boy
I'm on a tangent

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do

[Bridge]
I don't know what to do
I don't care about nothing but you, baby
I don't know what to do
I don't care about nothing but you, baby

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
