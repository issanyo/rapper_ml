[Chorus]
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And auld lang syne!

[Bridge]
For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne
For auld lang syne

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Chorus]

[Bridge][x2]

Eh

Happy New Year, baby

4,3,2,1

[Chorus]

Does anybody really know the words?
Might as well sing along

Happy New Year, baby
Happy New Year, baby

[Bridge]

Happy New Year
To you and your friends
And have a drink on me
Happy New Year
To you
And have a drink on me

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

Happy New Year!
