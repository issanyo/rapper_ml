[Verse 1]
It's only been 20 good minutes since I kissed you
Oh, come back boo, I miss you
Wish I had 20 million hours to caress you
And undress you, to be continued

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you, you don't know how it feels
When you whisper in my ear
Boy you, you give my body chills whenever you are near

[Chorus]
And boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah)
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
(Oh, oh, oh)
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
(Hey)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we argue and we fight
But they better know that that's my baby
You might even think he cute
But everybody knows that I'm his lady
Every time you see us, we super fly
So proud he's by my side
He knows I'm ride or die
You don't know how we roll
Holla at your people (Holla at you people)

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy you
You (Boy you)
You don't know how it feels when you whisper in my ear
(You don't know, Hey)
Boy you
You
(You give my body chills)
You give my body chills whenever you are near

[Chorus]
(And boy, I got you, boy, I got your lovin' on my mind)
(Lovin' on my mind)
And boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
(Oh)
Ribbon with a bow on it
(I got your lovin' on my mind)
(Lovin' on my mind)
I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
(On it, on it, on it, on it)

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

[Bridge]
Boy, I'm all wrapped up in you
You make me feel so unloose
Tell me what I'm suppose to do
When you're not around

[Hook]
Oh, baby (Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, baby (Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, baby (Hey, hey, hey)
Oh, baby (Hey, hey)
Oh, boy you got me (You got me)
You got me (You got me)

(Eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh)

[Chorus]
And boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
I got your lovin' on my mind
(With bow on it, ah)
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it

[Hook 2]
Got ribbon with a bow on it, baby
Boy, you don't even know the things you do
I could spend my whole life with you

[Outro]
(Baby, I'm wrapped up on you boo)
I got your lovin' on my mind
Baby, I could spend my life with you ooh
And it's been 20 good minutes since I kissed you
Come back boo, I miss you
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
