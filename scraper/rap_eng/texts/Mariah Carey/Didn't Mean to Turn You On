[Verse 1]
Let you take me out
I knew what you were all about
But when I did
I wasn't trying to lead you on
Now you bring me home
And tell me "goodnight"'s not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn’t mean to turn you on

[Chorus]
You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn’t mean to turn you on
Ho, I didn't mean to turn you on

[Verse 2]
I know you expected a one night stand
When I refused I knew you wouldn't understand
Boy, I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice, only trying to be nice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on, ho
Turn you on

[Instrumental breakdown]

[Verse 3]
Tell me why should I feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in?
I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby

[Chorus]
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
Ho, I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I didn’t mean to turn you on
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I didn’t mean to turn you on
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
You know I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)

[Bridge]
You think that I'm a fool
'Cause I wouldn't play by your rules
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
You don't stand a chance
All I want to do is dance with you
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I told you twice I was only trying to be nice
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)

[Verse 4]
I loved you for a friend
But I guess this is the end of our relationship
'Cause I didn’t mean to turn you on

[Chorus]
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I didn’t mean to turn you on
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I didn’t mean to turn you on
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
I didn’t mean to turn you on
(I didn’t mean to turn you on)
Ho, I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
