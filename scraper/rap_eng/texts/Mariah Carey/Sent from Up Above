[Intro]
I don't wanna live without your love

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine looking in someone else's eyes
What we have surpasses even paradise
It's hard to fathom
Reaching for someone else's hand
What we share is magic
Heaven had a plan

[Chorus]
Sent from up above (sent from up above)
So much love in my life
I can't get enough (just can't get enough)
Of your touch
Feels so right

[Verse 2]
Unending passion
Somehow the fire never dies
What we share is everlasting
Love without demise, oh, yes
He made it happen
Placed so much joy in our hands
What we dreamed we finally captured
Heaven took command

[Chorus]
Sent from up above
So much love in my life (in my life)
I can't get enough (no, no, no)
Of your touch
Feels so right
Sent from up above (sent from up above)
So much love in my life (in my life, in my life)
I can't get enough (just can't get enough)
Of your touch
Feels so right

[Bridge]
I don't wanna live without your love
Must have been sent from up above
Just can't get enough
I don't wanna live without your love
Must have been sent from up above
(Must have been sent from up above)

[Chorus]
Sent from up above
So much love in my life
I can't get enough
I don't wanna live without your love
Of your touch
You must have been sent from up above
Feels so right
Sent from up above
So much love in my life
I can't get enough (no, no)
Of your touch
Feels so right
Sent from up above
So much love in my life
I can't live without your love
You must have been sent from up above
I can't get enough
Of your touch
Feels so right
