[Verse 1]
I lay awake sometimes
Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
And lost the will to fight
And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me is languishing
And I'm too frozen to run

[Pre-Chorus]
And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

[Chorus]
'Cause, you see, I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me

[Verse 2]
An angel lands with broken wings
He warms me with his eyes
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart
Unravels as he smiles
See, I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learn to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again

[Pre-Chorus]
And every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

[Chorus]
'Cause, you see, I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me

[Verse 5]
But I keep going' cause every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine in time

[Chorus]
'Cause, you see, I've got a right to dream
There's more than this for me
