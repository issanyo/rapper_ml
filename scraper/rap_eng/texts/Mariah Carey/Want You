[Intro: Mariah Carey & Eric Benét]
It's just the way
It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
It's just the feeling that comes over me

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I would conceal the truth
You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child
Inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire
But I am not that girl today
Ain't got a lot of time for games
I've waited and I've waited
Now it's time for me to tell you 'bout the way

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Eric Benét]
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
(It's just the feeling)
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby
(It's just the way) Oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day, day

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey & Eric Benét]
Baby, I was so into you
Now I wonder why I never pursued you
The way I wanted to, oh, no
Kiss me and touch me and
(I wanna, I wanna feel, I wanna, I wanna feel)
Immerse your love in mine
(And I) I'll keep unraveling
As we explore our fantasies tonight
Tell me what you like
Now show me what you like, show me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Eric Benét]
It's just they way I want you, baby
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
(It's just the way) Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
(Feeling that comes over me)
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
(It's just the way)
Why it's just the way?
Why it's just the way?
Oh, it's just the way I feel about you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I feel about you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way I feel about you every night and day
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby
(Just the way) Oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day, day
