[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh) [x4]

[Verse 1]
I saw you yesterday
And I heard what you had to say
All those ugly ways you
Think about me, yeah
But I know it's okay
Gonna keep a smile on my face
Hate don't change the way
I feel about my inner being

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I won't let 'em dim my light (Won't let 'em dim)
And I'm holding my head up high (Holding my head up)
Even though my exterior
Is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep living my life
To defame my name and honey
Don't care what they say 'bout me

[Chorus]
Imperfect
That's all that i'll ever be
And god knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's
No one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
(Imperfect) [x3]

[Verse 2]
As I look at the TV screen
Internet and magazines
So much insecurity surrounds me (Eh yeah)
Wish I could change some things
Gotta steal with my self-esteem
Folks so superficial
Makes it hard to just survive

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I won't let 'em dim my light (Won't let 'em dim)
And I'm holding my head up high (Holding my head up)
Even though my exterior
Is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep living my life
To defame my name and honey
Don't care what they say 'bout me

[Chorus]
Imperfect
That's all that i'll ever be
And god knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's
No one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
(Imperfect) [x3]

[Bridge]
I may not walk like a super model or look as flawless as they do
I don't know where you get off judging
Cause I'm imperfect just like you
So I don't care about your status so I'll swear up to here I've had it
Ain't trying to win no beauty pageant cause in my heart is all that matters

[Chorus]
Imperfect
That's all that i'll ever be
And god knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's
No one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
(Imperfect) [x3]

[Chorus]
Oh that's all that I'll ever be
And god knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony (Trying, trying)
But the song of life is out of key (It's alright)
Just be perfectly (Baby baby baby)
Imperfect
(Imperfect) [x7]
