[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
The whole world feels a little bit more love
When Christmas comes
When Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go
People singing "Let It Snow"
And hanging up that mistletoe

[Hook: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
And me and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we're gonna kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one
Special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes
Oh baby, oh baby

[Verse 2: John Legend]
So many souls hurt
So many don't have enough
When Christmas comes
When Christmas comes
But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough
To heal each other
One by one

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
And we gonna get together
And rejoice and pray
And we gonna help the world
Become a better place
And we gonna sing and shout
Because the savior reigns
So don't dismay

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love
Lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes

[Verse 4: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
It's gonna be alright
When Christmas comes
Oh jingle all the way
Oh what fun, hmm
And we gonna reminisces about
The good old days
And we gonna laugh together as
The children play
And through the years is always
Gonna be this way
Come what may

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & John Legend]
Because this Christmas time
Get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one
That I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
When Christmas comes
