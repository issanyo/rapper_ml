Today a child is born on earth
Today a child is born on earth
Today the glory of God

Oh Jesus born on this day

Behold the Lamb of God has come
Behold the Lamb of God has come
Behold the Savior is born
Sing of His love

Oh Jesus born on this day
Heavenly child in a manger
Oh Jesus born on this day
He is our Lord and Savior

Today our hearts rejoice in him
Today our hearts rejoice in him

Fills us with hope
And brings peace on earth

Oh Jesus born on this day
He is the King of all nations

Today a child is born on earth
Today a child is born on earth

Born on Christmas day

Born on Christmas day

Born on Christmas day
He is light, He is love, He is grace
Born on Christmas day
