[Intro]
Happy jolly, and it's merry...
Christmas in New York

[Verse 1]
What do you feel like doing today
Is it snow
Will it snow
Will it keep on raining so?

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll go shopping
We're not stopping
Ain't no stopping cause it's Christmas in New York

[Chorus]
New York...

[Verse 2]
We gon' be singing and shouting, praising
It's amazing, Christmas in New York
I'm freestyling and it's not my best
But babe it's still there, still there
It's Christmas in New York

[Verse 3]
I feel like a dork
Cause I don't know much to say about it
But the packages everywhere
Seen in the streets, bright lights and people
I love you so
Come you know
To my Beacon show, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
We gon' make it snow, we gon' make it snow
On the stage, later on
I hope we gonna make it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow

[Outro]
Christmas time makes me feel so good
Specially when it's Christmas in New York
