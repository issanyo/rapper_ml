Oh, little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless
Sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in they dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all
The years are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep
The angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
Oh, morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praises sing
To God the King
And peace to men on Earth

How silently, how silently

The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of his heaven
No ear may hear his coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls
Will receive him still
The dear Christ enters in

Oh, holy child of Bethlehem
Descend to us we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emanuel

Come, they told me
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
A newborn king to see
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
To lay before the king
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, a pum pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
So to honor him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
When we come

Little baby
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I am a poor boy, too
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
That's fit
To give a king
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum

Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Shall I play for you
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
On my drum

Yoi da adash
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
The ass
And lamb kept time
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I played my drum for him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
I played my best for him
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Then he smiled at me
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Me and my drum
