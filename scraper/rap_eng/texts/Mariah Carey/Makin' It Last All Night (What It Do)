[Intro: Mariah Carey & Jermaine Dupri]
What it look like, look like?
What it do, what it do?
What it look like, look like?
What it do, what it do?
(MC, holla at the people one time)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Got me fly and sexy
Something in you gets me so tingly inside
Visions of us in the cut tonight
And I find you so appealing
Definitely feeling you
If you didn't know
Boy, you're the secret I've never told

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Bet you think I'm teasing
But I ain't got no reason to deny
The way I feel inside tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like "I want you over and over and over and over again"

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jermaine Dupri]
(What it look like?)
Me and you making it last all night
(What it do, what it do?)
My heart is beating faster all the time
(What it look like?)
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
(What it do, what it do?)
Ooh, boy. what you gonna do about it?

[Verse 2: Jermaine Dupri]
Listen, I got stacks like the international house of pancakes
Your man great, got more Rovers then a Land makes
I make hits and I don't care about your damn hate
Can't stop doing it, I just do it for the fans sake
You know this man take trips to Japan
Tell him to try to run out away
What would I land on
'05's my year, '06 ain't stopping
You woke up again and your chart I'm topping
That's how I do it, ma'am

[Bridge: Mariah Carey & Jermaine Dupri]
What must I say? (What must I say?)
What must I do (What must I do for you, babe?)
To show how much
I think about freaking you?
What must I say, what must I do?
To show how much
I think about freaking you?
Tonight, I need your body
(I need your body, baby)
Tonight, you got my time
(Every little second of my time, baby)
Tonight, you won't be sorry
(No, you won't be sorry, baby)
Tonight, you going be mine (Come on)

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Bet you think I'm teasing
But I ain't got no reason to deny
The way I feel inside tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like "I want you over and over and over and over again"

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Jermaine Dupri]
(What it look like?)
Me and you making it last all night
(What it do, what it do?)
My heart is beating faster all the time
(What it look like?)
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
(What it do, what it do?)
Ooh, boy what you going to do about it?
(What it look like?)
Me and you making it last all night
(What it do, what it do?)
My heart is beating faster all the time
(What it look like?)
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
(What it do, what it do?)
Ooh, boy what you going to do about it?
