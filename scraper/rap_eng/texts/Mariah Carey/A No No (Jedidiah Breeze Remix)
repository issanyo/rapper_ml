[Verse 1]
I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA "I cut you off" (No)
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with 'I'm sorry', but I'm sorry, (No)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, (No)
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no

[Verse 2]
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

[Pre-Chorus]
You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you

[Chorus]
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no
I said no
(I said no)
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no, I said no-no
No, no
No

[Verse 3: Jedidiah Breeze]
A yo shorty won't you go get a bag of the lethal
Glass heart gotcha tweakin' like you smokin' see through
Lightning bolts coming out yo head like you Pikachu
U be home face on Wendy red tryna beer with who
Act a fool cause ya friends assume that I’m playin' you
Clear da room feel da sonic boom tales they fly by 2s
I don’t do like them phony fools keep it G n true
Ridin' thru follow every move when I’m slidin' thru
Stepped on the gas like you holding a badge
Need a mechanic our love bout to crash
Racin' the raith and you and smash in the back
Head in the clouds as I’m burnin' the grass
Mind on my money and yo mind in the past
Threw me to gutters like yesterday’s trash
'cademy award why you actin' liking that
Destiny child when you singin' the track
No, no, no, when it’s really yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch me on Rodeo when I’m rollin' in the west to left
But you wanna leave fuck then i guess


[Chorus]
I said no
(I said no)
A no-no
(Look)
I said no-no
That's a no-no
(I said no)
No, no
I said no-no
(No)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no)
(And I said no)
(No, no, no)

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Parlez-vous français? I said no (That's a no, bitch!)
Lemme translate it, I said no (I said no, bitch!)
I can say it en español (en español, bitch!)
No
(No no no no)
Portuguese for you não
Japanese for you (iie)
(I said no)
(I said it)
(I said no)
I said no

I think, I think that was it
Yep
