If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it

If there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it

Think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you ooh ooh, baby

I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
The sweetest hangover

Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get
Over

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Oh, your love's so good, I don't wanna let go
And although I should, I can't leave you alone (ha, ha)
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist at all

Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby?
Or leaving me feeling used
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

It's a shame to be so euphoric and weak
When you smile at me and you tell me the things
That you know persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all

Heartbreaker you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly
Oh why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
I don't need no cure
Sweet love hangover

Sweet sweet sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love hangover

Sweet sweet sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love hangover

Don't call a doctor
Don't call my mama
Don't call my preacher

No, I don't need it
I don't want it

Sweet love hangover, baby
Sweet love
I need you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sweet sweet sweet sweet love

I don't wanna get

Don't want it, don't need it
I don't need it

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
