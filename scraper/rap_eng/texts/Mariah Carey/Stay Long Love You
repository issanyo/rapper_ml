[Verse 1: Mariah Carey & ?]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Would you mind, would you mind?
I like the way you're movin'
Come fill me with your music, yeah, yeah
Do you mind if I try?
I like the way you're movin'
Control me, make me lose it, ayy, yeah
Would you mind? Would you mind, baby?
How you want it? How you want it?
Tell me how you want it
Hot as mama's cookin' in the kitchen during summer
'Cause if you want it I could serve it, come and get it
Won't you let me clean the plate and do the dishes?

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
All that I want is to be all you need
Baby, in fact
Ooh, your good lovin' did something to me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna
Uh, uh, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
Do that thing and do that thing, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna
Uh, uh, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
You make me, make me wanna
Wanna stay long, love you

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I got your back, I wouldn't front (Wouldn't front)
I came that night, you know I want it (Want it)
I wake up to you in the morning (Morning)
And eat that pussy up for lunch (Eat that pussy up for lunch)
And I take care you like a son (I take care you like a son)
Heard they would talk but not on Sunday
Every day she help me count the money
Bought her diamonds just to match with the Chanel purse (Chanel)
We stick together, we can take over the whole world (Whole)
I know you expectin' it straighter than an S-curl (Whoa)
You constantly winning and shittin' on my ex-girl (Girl)

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna
Uh, uh, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
Do that thing and do that thing, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna
Uh, uh, yeah
You make me, make me wanna
You make me, make me wanna
Wanna stay long, love you

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Stay long, love
Stay long, love (Stay, stay, stay)
Stay long, love
Stay long, love (Stay, stay)
Stay long, love (Stay)
Stay long, love
Talk to me now

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You make me, make me wanna (You make me wanna touch you)
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna (You make me wanna kiss you)
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna (Oh-oh)
Uh, uh, yeah (Oh yeah)
You make me, make me wanna
Do that thing and do that thing, yeah (You make me wanna)
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there (Touch you right there)
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna
Uh, uh, yeah (Oh, you make me)
You make me, make me wanna
You make me, make me wanna
Wanna stay long, love you
