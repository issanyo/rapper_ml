MC
This is the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
Da, da, da, da, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
Like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all) MC
{It's like that y'all, like that y'all
Like that-a-tha-that a-like that y'all
It's like that y'all, like that y'all

[Intro: Mariah]
I came to have a party (party-party-party)

[Verse 1: Mariah]
Open off the Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy, I know you watching me
So what's it going to be?
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feeling me

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah]
Because it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everybody is living it up
All the fellows keep looking at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

[Verse 2: Mariah]
You like this and you know it
Caution, it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it
Let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion
Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah]
Because it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everybody is living it up
All the fellows keep looking at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

[Bridge]
Cause it's
Cause it's
Cause it's
Cause it's, baby (my night)
It's my, it's my, it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears (no tears), no time to cry
Just making the most of life

[Chorus: Mariah]
Everybody is living it up (I said everybody)
All the fellows keep looking at us (because)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinning the cut
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, y'all (that, y'all), that, y'all (that, y'all)
It's like that, that, that, that, I like that, y'all (that, y'all)

This is my night
