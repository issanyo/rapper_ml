[Intro]
Oh ooh ooh ooh
Oh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh ooh ooh
Why do I stay, why do I stay in love? Ooh
Oh ooh ooh ooh (why do I stay)
Oh ooh ooh (why do I stay in love?)
Oh oh ooh ooh ooh (oh baby)
Baby, I stay in love with you

[Verse 1]
Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up, can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is baby, I try and try so hard to keep our love alive

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it
From our hearts and minds and I know

[Chorus]
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down (like "oh, well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na (why do I stay, why do I stay in love?)
Na na na na na na na na na
Baby, I stay in love with you

[Verse 2]
It cuts so deep, it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gonna act like what we had ain't nothing at all now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down, like we used to
Hit the block, proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone
Now go, I know

[Chorus]
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down (like "oh, well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself
That you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down (like "oh, well")
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you (baby baby baby, I stay in love!)

[Outro]
Na na na na na na na na na (oh, love)
Na na na na na na na na na (oh, I stay)
Na na na na na na na na na (love)
Baby, I stay in love with you (I stay in love!)
