[Intro]
Higher
Higher
Higher
(Higher)

[Verse 1]
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I’m in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it’s real
But I like the way I feel inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Verse 2]
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I really like the way I feel inside

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You’ve got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Whoa, you, emotions
Deeper than I’ve ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

[Bridge]
You know the way to make me lose control
When you’re looking into my eyes
You make me feel so, higher
Emotions

[Chorus]
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Higher
Emotions
Deeper than I’ve ever dreamed of (oh yes you do)
You've got me feeling emotions
(Yeah)
(Higher, emotions)
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
Oh, you, emotions, emotions
You got me feeling higher

[Outro]
Thank you!
Thank you so much
