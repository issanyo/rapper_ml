[Chorus]
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
And you're fading fast, it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

[Verse 1]
I keep on reaching and I, I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me, baby
I keep on yearning and I
I guess I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes

[Chorus]
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
And you're fading fast, it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

[Verse 2]
I keep denying that our, our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play
I can't remember when you
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
Your silence chills me to the bone

[Chorus]
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
And you're fading fast, it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
Away, away, away, away, away
Further, further (further, further)
You're so far

[Bridge]
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be? (Where?)
Baby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof (Baby, baby)
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (You're so far)

[Chorus]
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, you're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
And you're fading so fast, it seems
You know you're slipping away from me

[Outro]
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (So far)
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof (So far, yeah)
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me (So far away)
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be? (Where?)
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you
I try and I try but you're so aloof
