Ooh, oh yeah...

Shoe do do do do do do do
Shoe do do do do do do ya...
Shoe do do do do do do do
Shoe do do do do do do ya...

Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kinda hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Shoe do do do do do do do
Shoe do do do do do do ya...

Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Shoe do do do do do do do
Shoe do do do do do do ya...

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning, and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
On and on and on
It's so deep in my daydream
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy baby

Sweet sweet fantasy baby...
Shoe do do do do do do do
