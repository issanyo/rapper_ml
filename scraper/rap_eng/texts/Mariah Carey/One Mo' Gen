[Chorus]
(Oh) Did you like when I put my lips there?
(Oh) 'Cause I like when you're kissin' me everywhere
(Oh) Do you mind if we go back in (Go back in)
One mo' gen? (One mo' gen)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?

[Verse 1]
You give me that fever I keep tryna break
Been a little while but I don't mind the wait
I'm gon' need a ride home now, sooner than late
Must I reiterate? Can we pick up the pace?

[Pre-Chorus]
And once we lit this towering inferno (Yeah, yeah)
The flame keeps burning higher the harder we go (Yeah, yeah)
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely
Come and give me what you owe me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) Did you like when I put my lips there?
(Oh) 'Cause I like when you're kissin' me everywhere
(Oh) Do you mind if we go back in (Go back in)
One mo' gen? (One mo' gen)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen (Da-da-da-da)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen (Da-da-da)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen? (Mmm)

[Verse 2]
Ain't no use in bein' stingy with it
If you think you're gettin' off, forget it
And if you think it ain't all for you, you're wrong
Baby, it's all for you
Addicted to you, come support my habit
Third person, yeah she gotta have it
If you think I'm on call for you, you're right
Baby, I'm onto you

[Pre-Chorus]
And once we lit this towering inferno (Yeah, yeah)
The flame keeps burning higher the harder we go (Yeah, yeah)
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely (Na-na-na-na-na)
Come and give me what you owe me, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
(Oh) Did you like when I put my lips there? (C'est parti)
(Oh) 'Cause I like when you're kissin' me everywhere (Andiamo)
(Oh) Do you mind if we go back in (Go back in)
One mo' gen? (One mo' gen, comme tes pas que)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen (C'est parti)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen (Just one mo' gen)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?

[Outro]
J'en veux encore
Do you like it?
¿Dónde vas?
(Can we just get it in one mo' gen?)
Mais uma vez
One mo' gen, one mo' gen, one mo gen'
