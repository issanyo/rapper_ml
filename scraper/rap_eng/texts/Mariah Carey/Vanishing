[Verse 1]
If I could recapture all of the memories
And bring them to life, surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me surviving the night?
You're fading out of my sight swiftly

[Chorus]
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing

[Verse 3]
I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside swiftly

[Chorus]
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're

[Verse 5]
Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would

[Verse 6]
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside swiftly

[Chorus]
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
Vanishing
Away
