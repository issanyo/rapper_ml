[Verse 1]
You're with me 'til the bitter end
What we had transcends this experience
Too painful to talk about
So I'll hold it in 'til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again
A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

[Chorus]
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember

[Verse 2]
Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved in my mind
In the memories I'll find solace

[Chorus]
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember

[Bridge]
A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace

[Chorus]
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And though we can never be
I'll think of you and me
Always remember love
You're never too far
