[Verse 1]
I've been waiting for someone to come into my life
Who would bring me joy and give me pleasure
I have taken chances on romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart it's you I treasure

[Pre-Chorus]
You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

[Chorus]
All my life my love's been waiting for you
All my life my heart's been waiting too

[Post-Chorus]
All my, all my, all my life
All my, all my, all my life

[Verse 2]
I've been wishing on a star, I've been praying on my knees
I've got some sly and sexy tricks to show you
Most of all I'll give you anything boy that you need
To keep you right here by my side, I know you, I'll show you

[Pre-Chorus]
You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever

[Chorus]
All my life my love's been waiting for you
All my life my heart's been waiting too
Don't you know I need you and adore you
All my life I'll give to only you

[Post-Chorus]
All my, all my, all my life
All my, all my, all my life

[Outro]
I have taken chances of romances once or twice
