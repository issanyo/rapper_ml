[Intro]
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him

[Verse 1]
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens and let me be free to

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

[Verse 2]
Can we recover?
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality?
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent that I feel the need to

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

[Bridge]
I need you right now, right now, Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head to the sky
With God's love, you'll survive

[Chorus]
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come (I'll pray) and carry me home
You'll come and take me home
Fly like a bird, take to the sky
I need you now Lord, carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Carry me home, oh, carry me home
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
I need you to come and carry me higher, Lord
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home, higher, Jesus
Just carry me higher Lord
