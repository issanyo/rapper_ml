[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I thought we'd be forever and always
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right but it was O.K
I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone and

[Pre-Chorus: Ne-Yo]
We were so good together
How come we could not weather
This storm and just do better
Why did we say goodbye?

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & (Mariah Carey)]
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
(C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?)
(Bring it back and we gon' make it right)
(I'm on the edge just trying' to survive)
(As the angels cry)

[Bridge: Mariah Carey]
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Baby, I'm missing' you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say

[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Ne-Yo]
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Oh, babe, don't let angels cry
