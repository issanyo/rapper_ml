Chorus**Just**
To be close to you Girl
Just
For a moment Just
For an hour Just
To be close to you Girl
I've

Been out there Searching
So very long Searching
To find somebody Just
Like you And
For some folks It
Takes a lifetime Sugar
To
Find in this world a dream come true Chorus

**To**

Give love And
Be loved by you baby To
Have your warm body Close
To mine To
Whisper words That
Make you feel Like
A woman Girl
I know our love Will
Stand the test Of
Time Chorus

**Take**

My hand We'll
Live in forever girl Take
My hand Girl
We'll be alone just you and me Take

My hand We'll
Spend our lives Together
Yeah, Together
Together
Chorus

**Just**

To be close to you Girl
For
The moment baby For
The moment baby For
The moment baby For
The moment baby For
The sugar Sugar
Yeah yeah yeah
