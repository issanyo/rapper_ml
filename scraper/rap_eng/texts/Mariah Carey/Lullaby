[Chorus]
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

[Verse 1]
Hey boy, what's going on?
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumors- hey
How's your family?
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to you, you and I

[Chorus]
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

[Verse 2]
So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar, you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark, all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
'Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name

[Chorus]
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight

[Bridge]
It still feels, feels good

[Chorus]
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
(So hush pretty baby)
But I just can't walk away from paradise
(It's just me and you)
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
(To relieve the splendor of you and I)
And we can revisit us one more time
(I'll sing that sweet lullaby)
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
