[Verse 1]
A broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other?
Isn't there enough to share?

[Chorus]
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change (bring on a change)

[Verse 2]
In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry

[Pre-Chorus]
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we accept each other?
Can't we make ourselves aware?

[Chorus]
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change (bring on a change)

[Bridge]
And maybe then the future will be a time
Without war, destitution and sorrow
And hungry children won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow
Come on, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just love each other?
Isn't there enough to share?

[Chorus]
(There's got to be a way)
(To connect this world today)
Come together to relieve the pain (the pain, the pain)
(There's just got to be a way)
There's got to be a way
(To unite this human race)
And together we'll bring on a change
(There's just got to be a way)
(There's got to be a way)
(To connect this world today)
There's got to be, there's got to be
There's got to, got to, got to be a way
(There's got to be a way)
(To unite this human race)
