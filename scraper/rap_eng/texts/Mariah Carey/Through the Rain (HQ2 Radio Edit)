When you get caught in the rain, with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain, without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arrive safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
What you say

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

And when the wind blows
As shadows grow close, don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And sure they tell you, you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate, stand tall and say, yeah

I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain

I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day and night
And I can make it through the rain
(Oh yes you can)
You're gonna make it through the rain
