Even though I try, I can't let go
Maybach music

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Even though I try, I can't let go
Thoughts of you and I still kill me slow
And every night I feel you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Guilty pleasures late night, I call it innocent
Hear you play a lot of games, a couple instruments
Snapchat wars and I got her role playing
She got her own man, tell him that your phone dead
Hustle is a code ain't no limit to this dope
Invest time pen rhymes now I got it so boss
Invest into a weak woman one becomes weak
Reflection of the man truly I'm a born king
Rose from the sewers while you was in the subs
Coach show love first class now that's us
Spilling champagne you should see the smile on us
Congratulations from the ones who tried to style on us

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Even though I try, I can't let go
Thoughts of you and I still kill me slow
And every night I feel you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Yes I'm single and wealthy, if you freaky then tell me
Never run from your past still photobombing your selfie
Was we ready for this move really honestly
Did you ever have the tools to really honor me
Well I fell in love and I had a great time
Now I'm back out on the streets no more face times
For the have nots I could've been a mascot
A limit timid with these women on my cash route
Counting paper in the ghetto underneath my rag top
Money come and go exception is my stash spot
Black bag black dollar on the black market
Mariah Carey, Renzel, trending topic

[Hook: Mariah Carey]
Even though I try, I can't let go
Thoughts of you and I still kill me slow
And every night I feel you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go

My chick bad, lookin' like a bag of money
Shawtyy got her mind right, send the wire in the morning'
She got me caught up in the moment
She got me caught up in the moment
Mariah, Renzel, I let you baby
I can't let go, I can't let go, I can't let go
Even though I try
Play that music
