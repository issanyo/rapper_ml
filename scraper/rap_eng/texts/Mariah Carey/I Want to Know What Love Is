[Verse 1]
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus]
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna take a little time (Take a little time)
A little time to look around me (Ooh)
I've got nowhere left to hide (Nowhere left to hide)
It looks like love has finally found me (Ohh)

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life

[Chorus]
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is (Feel what love is)
And I know you can show me
Show me, I wanna know
I wanna know what love is
(Ohh, I wanna know)
I want you to show me
(And I'm feeling so much love)
I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel)
And I know you can show me, hey, yeah
I wanna know what love is
Let's talk about love
I want you to show me
