Baby can I hold you one more time
Before we say our last goodbye
We've seen love grow now we watch as it dies
Baby why pretend and live a lie

**Chorus**
Don't you know that we gave all we had
And we tried baby, but it just hurt so bad
So we loved and we lost everything that we had
Thought we'd always be in love

Just let me touch you that way once again
Remember how it was before it ends
Just for a moment please let's love again
Before we close the door and we can't get in

**Chorus**

And my heart is breaking that we ended up this way
How can I go on
How can I be strong
When my life and my love has gone

**Chorus**
