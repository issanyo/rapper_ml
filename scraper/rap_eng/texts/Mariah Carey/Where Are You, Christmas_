Where are you, Christmas?
Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me?
Why can’t I hear music play?
My world is changing (Our world is changing)
I'm rearranging (Rearranging)
Does that mean Christmas changes too?

Where are you, Christmas? (Where are you, Christmas?)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
The one you used to know?
I'm not the same one
See what the time has done
Is that why you have let me go? (Woah)

Christmas is here
Everywhere, oh
Christmas is here
If you care, oh
If there is love in your heart and your mind (In your heart and mind)
You will feel like Christmas all the time (Oh)

I feel you, Christmas (I feel you, Christmas)
I know I’ve found you
You never fade away (Fade away)
Where are you, Christmas?
Why can't I find you?
Why have you gone away?
