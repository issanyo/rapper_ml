[Spoken intro]
This next song is made popular
By incredible Jackson 5
And it's always been one of my favorite songs
And I hope it's yours
It's called "I'll be there"

Ooh ooh

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name
And I'll be there

[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
I'll be there to comfort you
I'll build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you, yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well it's all I'm after
Just call my name
And I'll be there
Yeah, yeah

I'll be there to protect you (yeah, I'll be there)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name
And I'll be there
(I'll be there)


[Chorus: Trey Lorenz]
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
You know I'm so glad I found you, babe (so glad babe)
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength (be your strength)
You know I'll keep holding on


[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
Because if she doesn't
Then I'll be there (I'll be there)

[Outro]
Don't you know baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there
I'll be there
Just call my name (I'll be there)
And I'll be there
Yeah, yeah ,yeah, yeah

I'll be there baby (I'll be there)
You know I'll be there yeah ,yeah, yeah
Just call my name (I'll be there)
And I'll be there

Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name
And I'll be there
