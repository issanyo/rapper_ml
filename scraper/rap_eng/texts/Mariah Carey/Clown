[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around

[Verse 1]
I should've left it at "How ya doin'?"
I should've left it at "I like your music too" and
I should've never called you back when you pursued me
I should've never given you my fucking two way
I should've never listened to your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated we were lovers
When you know very well we never even touched each other

[Chorus]
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore?
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around

[Verse 2]
I gotta break it to ya delicately, dummy
Taking my G5 twenty minutes wasn't nothing
But I guess you wouldn't know that's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully overblown
You don't want the world to know that you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries

[Chorus]
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody

[Bridge]
Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become?
You try to hide it, but you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

[Chorus]
(Tell me who's gonna love you?)
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
(I'd like to know)
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
(Who's gonna be there? Nobody, nobody, nobody!)
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down

[Chorus]
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
