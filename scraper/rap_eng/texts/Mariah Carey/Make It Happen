[Verse 1]
Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough (if you believe)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord (you just gotta hold on)
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

[Interlude]
Make it happen, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

[Bridge]
I once was lost but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough (you're gonna make it)
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
