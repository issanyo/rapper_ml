[Verse 1]
Shattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Trustingly, I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies

[Chorus]
And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be in love

[Verse 2]
Stranded here
In nothingness
With only tears
And loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Foolishly, I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies

[Chorus]
And you don't remember
(And you don't remember)
Every time you told me
(Every time you told me)
You were mine forever
For eternity
And you don't remember
(And you don't remember)
How you used to hold me
(How you used to hold me)
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be

[Bridge]
Helplessly, I fell so deep
I was so naive to let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart

[Chorus]
And you don't remember
(Every time you told me)
Anything that you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
Yes, you will
I know you don't remember
(I know you don't remember)
How you used to hold me
(How you used to hold me)
How we'd melt together, together
How you needed me
How we used to be in love
