[Verse 1]
When I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through

[Verse 2]
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all

[Chorus]
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee

[Verse 3]
If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to

[Verse 4]
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all

[Chorus]
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee

[Verse 5]
You take me through
The loneliness and emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause your by my side

[Chorus]
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
So sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby all I have I want to give to thee

[Outro]
Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee
