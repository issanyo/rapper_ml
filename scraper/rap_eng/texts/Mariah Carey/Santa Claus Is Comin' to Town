[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He sees when you are sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 2]
I guess in girl and boy land
We'll have a jubilee
We're gunna build a toy land
All around the Christmas tree

[Chorus]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
