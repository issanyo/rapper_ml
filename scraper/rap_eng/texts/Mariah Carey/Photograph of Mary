I keep a photograph of Mary
I keep it lying by my bed
And every time I look up
I get so badly shook up
I wish that she were here instead

Gets so lonely without Mary
I can't get her off my mind
And after all we've been through
I'll do whatever it takes to
Get her back into my life

**Chorus**
Na na na na na na

I've got memories of Mary
I keep them all inside my head
If only I could find her
I would just remind her
Of all the good times that we had

**Chorus**

What did I do to make her walk away
And leave me on my own
And I think I have the right
To know where we went wrong
'Cause I'll never get over you

I keep a photograph of Mary
I keep it lying by my bed
And every time I look up
I get so badly shook up
I wish that she were here instead

**Chorus**
