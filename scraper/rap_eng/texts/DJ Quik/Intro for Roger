[22 second instrumental to open]

[DJ Quik]
The stuff I seen it was inevitable I be a businessman
I knew that I would get some resistance whenever I took this stand
Now this is how yo' street works, everybody hates each other
Until they in each other's face, and then it be cousins brothers
And loved ones, it's all just a race
To see who can grab the most nuts and get back to the house in one place
You niggas wanna be on squirrel time, I'm around the world time
Until I gotta come back to court, talk to my kids and they're fine
This is my intro, I'm scratchin' Chingy, comin' blingy this time
I'm showin' off my hands and freestylin, showin' you through my mind
This is for Roger Troutman, he helped me when I was so blind
To see that y'all would freak out on me at an opportune time
I shoulda seen it comin'

[Hook]
Niggas tryin to talk me outta this shit
I'm tryin to put this nigga outta this bitch
He fuckin with my chips I gotta resist
I'm tryin to put this nigga outta this bitch
Niggas tryin to talk me outta this shit
I'm tryin to get this hooker outta this bitch
She fuckin with my chips I gotta resist
I'm tryin to get this hooker outta this bitch

[DJ Quik]
I live in Los Scandalous, California
It's the most beautiful sunset 'til cowards run up on ya
And then it's curtains you hurtin' for what yo' mouth had been blurtin'
Where you don't love who you squirtin cause she just might be workin'
I ain't sharin a fuckin' thing, I'm a rider for certain
Shake the homies with self-esteem problems, give 'em some Jergens
Bitch problems weaken the love for the homey seekin' to sub for the homies
Tweak and do drugs now no homey he just be lurkin'
My best friend's dead, my heart is a stone
My soul ain't even mine to own, they say it's a loan
And I feel sorry for any nigga that diss me it's on
I'm comin' with pencils pistols and crystals you gone
It's premeditated now nigga

[Hook]

[Outro]
Man I done seen the nigga go through some shit
Family messin' with him, gangbangin', man
Get his drink on, for a long time
Trippin', gettin' on motorcycles man, and standin' on 'em
Losin' and fallin', scandalous-ass baby momma
Lettin' homies, so-called homies fuck
Tryin' to make my nigga look bad
Then they end up in Atlanta, got hit with some hot ones
That's what they get, keep on pushin' Quik
