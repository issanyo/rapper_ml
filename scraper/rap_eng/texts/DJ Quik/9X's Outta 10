[Hook: Kurupt]
When it stops!
9 times outta 10, it's gonna start again
Where it started at, ended up, and restart again
Get your mind in the right position before it starts again
Cause when it drops

9 times outta 10, it's gonna drop again
Stopwatch, hide another watch
Flock flocking in, flocks stop just to see the pop
Watch I'll be there when it stops!

9 times outta 10, it's gonna start again
Where it started at, ended up, and restart again
Get your mind in the right position before it starts again
Cause when it drops

9 times outta 10, it's gonna drop again
Stopwatch, hide another watch
Flock flocking in, flocks stop just to see the pop
Watch I'll be in rear motion
Cause I'll be in rear motion

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
Get your calculator to calculate this
Difficult as calculus and it's just us, me and Quik

So sick, so fast, so quick
Music worth brick
Treat it like we on the strip

Treat it like we on the strip
It ain't shit, it ain't a hit
'Less the ladies wanna strip
Count your grip
Come equipped
And if you ain't sayin shit then make it storm

Or make it rain, make it hurricane
Typhoons, Tycoons
I assume delusions, illusions
Like mushrooms, get it now or pretty soon
Irradiated mushrooms

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Irradiate entire rooms
Go bananas, baboons, just (STOP!)

[Hook: Kurupt]
9 times outta 10, it's gonna start again
Where it started at, ended up, and restart again
Get your mind in the right position before it starts again
Cause when it drops

9 times outta 10, it's gonna drop again
Stopwatch, hide another watch
Flock flocking in, flocks stop just to see the pop
Watch I'll be there when it stops!

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
14 3 50
Around the clock pop
Around the block, around the whole circumference in abundance
Fear like Ted Bundy
Jed and Ed Bundy, you'll take all I have from me
Toil turmoil I bounce back like bungees
You'll get thrown away like scrungies
Don't talk to me no more about no motherfucking money
Cannonball, run em up
Run em up, running them up, summon up, the whole confrontation
Waitin my patience is aching
I sum it up
Coming up with such a wait
The impatience dumb enough to fuck it up
Look I sum it up, just stop

9 times outta 10, if you have to dump again, when you gunnin' up, to get to it, when you have to dump again, just to keep it on a piss, and move diss tart again, just POP

[Hook: Kurupt]
9 times outta 10, it's gonna start again
Where it started at, ended up, and restart again
Get your mind in the right position before it starts again
Cause when it drops

9 times outta 10, it's gonna drop again
Stopwatch, hide another watch
Flock flocking in, flocks stop just to see the pop
Watch I'll be in rear motion
Cause I'll be in rear motion
