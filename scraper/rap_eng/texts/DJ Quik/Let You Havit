[DJ Quik]

Yeah

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Now this is for the G's who know we needs that gangsta shit
It's like the P-Funk we funk so its gotsta hit
And when you fire up that hooter pass it to the young G
The nigga Mista Quik, that's me from the C-to-the-P-to-the-T
And when I'm givin' it up for my hood you can't clown
Cause when we lettin' off you gots to duck down
And then we're rollin' back to the spot where they hang
(Westside fo'hundred street gang) so it's a street thang
Makin' that grip and stackin' the chips high
Ballin', never fallin', I gots to stay fly
Whether they smokin' up them beadies or rollin' the joints fat
I gotta kick it with my niggas cause it's like that
And you need to know I ain't for none, because I'm dumpin'
The hollow point rounds that got everybody humpin'
But niggas they keep on mouthin', kickin' up the static
But keep on talkin' shit and I'mma let you havit

[Hook]
Yeah yeah
Huh, I'mma let you havit
Yeah
Check this

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Somebody told me that you dissed me (bitch) in your video
But I ain't trippin cause I'm knowin you ain't nothin but a silly ho
And yeah I said your monkey ass name in my underground tape
But if you peeped game you woulda heard me say
("To the top of the tree, for C-M-W  to see")
We wasn't dissin lettin you know the other side was on a mission
Comin up with the Quik-ness, now you know who's dick this is
Down in the throats of the Compton's Most Bitchest
So take this shit back to your set if you got one
And I'mma be puttin the double aught bucks in my shotgun
And if you come back fuckin' around I'mma take your life
Why would you come back to a gunfight, with a fuckin knife?
So there it is MC Eiht, cause you're wack
And Mista Quik can beat the niggas down with another sack
So keep on rollin' in your Camry or your Rabbit but
If I catch you slippin' in my hood, gotta let you havit

[Hook]
Ahh yeah
Gotta let you havit
Huh, I'mma let you havit
