[Hook: Will.I.Am]
They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who? Hot Karl gonna switch it back up

[Verse 1: Hot Karl]
Something's changed, let's go toe for toe
Cause nobody's watching you, like Queen Latifah's talk show
And as far as being just another rapper, that's over
I'm the Jewish Jay-Z, the Hebrew Hova
A college graduate, yo I'm not here to fight
"I don't get it, a white rapper... who acts white?"
But when I grab the mic with the style that I bring
Nerdy white kids line up like it was "Lord Of The Rings"
It's changed, try to front and play the hot post
But admit that if we battle then you ain't coming close
It's a joke, you must've thought I'd amount to zero
Cause I'm the Suge Knight with Woody Allen as my hero
Why's that kid on MTV with a sombrero?
The man, while you're just a fan, like Bob DeNiro?
But if I'm found dead, laying in a gutter
Make a poetry CD and tell Meadow that I love her

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who? Some motherfucker done fucked it up

[Verse 2: Hot Karl]
If Hot Karl don't blow up, I'm 'a be pissed
Cause then I'm stuck with an H and a K tatted on my wrists
With a college education that didn't mean shit
Cause I had the opportunity but couldn't make a hit
Oh well, I won't be surprised if that happens
We live in a world where O-Town goes platinum
It's hard to tell exactly what'll sell
I really miss Aaliyah cause I'm stuck with Blu Cantrell
What the fuck? I mean, every rock/rap group
Sounds exactly the same and still blows up
So now I'm pissed on some West Coast shit
So you know I had to make a call to DJ Quik
Cause to tell my story it had to be bumpin'
To prove the suburbs could flow just like Compton
Here's a rap lesson for kids who act shook
Here's the sixteenth bar... *gasp* now here's the hook

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who? Some motherfucker done fucked it up

[Verse 3: Hot Karl]
I grew up with white kids who live suburban lives
Who graduated college just to work a 9-to-5
To satisfy the parents that they secretly despise
And when it's all exposed people act like they surprised
I got dissed for rapping, ain't that silly?
Cause now they they ones going "WUH-OHH!" with Nelly
It went mainstream and it caught mass appeal
Hey, that ain't bad, shit, it's why I got a deal
But no matter what, I'm 'a just be me
Go triple platinum by myself and bang Alicia Keys
I'm here to make sure all those kids know the truth
And fake rappers hide in they trunks like Rae Carruth
And I made fun of people so I'm genuinely hoping
The cats in the game understand I'm only joking
But it's my time, H.K. gon' do it
Make three million kids scream out "Keep it Jewish!"

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who? Who's the dumb motherfucker done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?

They don't seem the same
Things is rearranged
Something's changed
I say who done fucked it up?
Who done fucked it up?
