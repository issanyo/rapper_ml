Quik and Kurupt
Yeah, everybody was born with a brain
But nobody born with instructions to use it

[Kurupt]
The more I think about it I see
Nothing else can happen to me
The more I take a look and I saw
The more I watch, the more I’m involved
And every little step that I take
And every little move I could make
And every little move I could make
And every breath it take to escape
The more I try to get me some cheese
The more this niggas try to impeach
Cause slow away the games a speech
Its easy to give up than succeed
The more a nigga gaining speed
The more these niggas aiming at me
I still keep it D.P.G
Just a little piece of pie I deserve
Cause you don’t really wanna get served
I’m just trying to educate you with words
I’m just trying to hit the scoul with the birds
And make a billion off of head sticking nerds
Got me a plan to get this money with ease
Just me, DAB, and the Three’s
2 Mac 11’s a breeze
Plus the bomb as endo weed
The more I think about it I can see
Nothing else is troubling me
The more I think about it I saw
The more I watch the more I’m involved

[Chorus: Desiree Anderson]
The more I think about it
The more I wanna get involved
It shouldn’t be hard to do it
You gotta feel somebody, show ‘em it’s real
The less I work around it
The more my problems solved
I wouldn’t get too caught up in it
But it’s all I’m feelin’, and I’m so real an’

[DJ Quik]
Now what would a saint do?
Quiksta, this ain’t you
Avoid all these dirty girls who came here to take you
But I’m homosapien
I’m lovin’ what they be in
I’m trying to crash with them like the zilgen of sapien
Oh, you could park the temptation
No I can’t dawg she’s Asian
And she’s finer than Lacey Macey or Kimi Kardayshian
Fuck it, I’m crazy then
Fuck it, I’m crazy then, but look at the space I’m in
I’m in this room with three broads and a dude
And I’m getting all the attention
So I look rude
Cause it looks like I’m having too much fun
I look over at dude
He got that wrinkle in his brow
Here we go now
Am I gonna have to shoot this motha fucka?
Yeah, mind you I will, at some point, it’s real
And at this point I just gotta show suckas how I feel
I bailed out their garage and left with the broads

[Chorus: Desiree Anderson]
The more I think about it
The more I wanna get involved
It shouldn’t be hard to do it
You gotta feel somebody, show ‘em it’s real
The less I work around it
The more my problems solved
I wouldn’t get too caught up in it
But it’s all I’m feelin’, and I’m so real an’
