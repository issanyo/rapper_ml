[Intro: Xzibit]
Come here Tre, what's up son, come on
To whom it may concern, yeah, listen
Sorry I'm away so much, yeah, yeah
All the sons, daughters, penitentiary niggas, yeah feel me
Uh, sorry I'm away so much, yeah

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
My son was born about four and a half years ago
Loved and protected him, amazin' how fast they grow
I came to know about his likes and his dislikes (yeah)
Video games, taught him how to ride his first bike (that's it)
This is the life my little nigga, I see you gettin' all upset
When I leave the house, poutin', let me tell you about
Tryna' make it in this world and provide for you
Cause on them overseat plane rides I miss you too
Never knew that I would have to be away so much
Five thousand dollar phone bills keepin' in touch
We Starskey and Hutch, yeah, we partners for life (yeah)
I rock mics, so I'm sorry when I hug you if I squeeze too tight
Long nights in the studio take me away
Gettin' mad cause I'm tired and you want me to play
Money can't replace time, I'm just tryna get you outta the fine relyin' and expand your mind my lil' ni', yeah
Yeah, c'mon

[Chorus-Xzibit]
Look, sorry I'm away so much
Understand me, yeah
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)
C'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much
Huh, we keep it gangsta

[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Look, I got a brother locked down, he be out in a couple
Knuckle for knuckle, a veteran and nothin' but muscle
Now broadcastin' live from behind the wall
Stayin' tight through long kites and telephone calls
Gettin' hype when you see your brother on T.V
Can't wait for your release so you can roll with me
Arrange everything exactly how it's supposed to be
For right now here's a thousand, J, stay low-key
You say damn Xzibit, whyn't you pay a nigga a visit
Time limits got me movin a million miles a minute
Knee deep, gotta strike while the iron is hot
Still gotta eat and keep the lights on when it's not
Sleepin' on cots, bullet wounds got you in knots
I wish I was there to snatch you up instead of the cops
Muthafuck it, do the time and get it out of the way
You goin' from convict to corporate nigga in one day (in one day)

[Chorus: Xzibit]
Yeah, we keep it moving
Sorry I'm away so much
All the daughters, all the sons
It's for you, hah, yeah (you, and you, and you)
C'mon, look, sorry I'm away so much
Huh, we keep it gangsta

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Now I ain't never been this hot before
So in essence it's obvious, I ain't never been this out before
I'm spending 25-8 days, 366 times a year
Up in the studio freakin' and mixin' rhymes in here
Nothin' but beer, bud smoke, Hen and Coke
Women and sheer, callin' playa niggas there
Not the kinda place I really wanna bring my son
Get on lil' Dane, gon' in there and have you some fun
Used to be there cook a beat up there sewin' your clothes
While I'm with you on the Play Station showin' you codes
Hit the X button stupid, forward, left, right, X
Now I'm tryna get your college fund, bustin' with X

[Outro: Suga Free]
Come here, give that here dada
No no don't do that mama cause dada be back
Here go your ba-ba, Pampers, flashy and you can see that
You tryna figure out why dada talkin to you through this glass on the phone, oh, I socked a bitch and then she snitched
But I'll be home, can't keep me away, just can't stay away
That's my P.O baby, she don't want nothin'
She just want me to pee in that cup, you want ba-ba?
Sleepy?
