[Intro: DJ Quik]
Yes
Tony! Toni! Ton√©!
And DJ Quik
You didn't think we could flip it on yo ass, huh?
Something for the dance floor
In a real way
It's going down like this forever
In a day

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Now what you hear is not a drag
'Cause Mr. DJ Quik got a brand new bag
But first I gotta bang bang
A boogie for the boogie
To the rhythm of the ghettoey streets
Check it out now
You trying to give me some Eight Ball
But no way
I'd rather have a Mimosa with Cristal and O.J., yeah
Just a little something bubbly and tingly
To have me walking around naked
But wait a second

[Verse 2: Raphael Saddiq]
The function's on
Around midnight
What time is it?
Are you inside?
Available
To come and play
Give me a clue
So I don't have to
Look for you

[Chorus: Raphael Saddiq]
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down, let's get down

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Yeah, now we don't need a club
We can do it at my house
My front door's open so homies can bust it out
And ladies if you're coming leave your children at the nursery
So you can Slow Wine to Anniversary
Feel me
I dip, dip by
So don't be looking stupid when I unfasten your bra
You know you want to mack this
Because I come stronger than the IRS
Whenever you done got delinquent on your taxes

[Verse 4: Raphael Saddiq]
Now here I am
Staring at you
I need a drink
You need one too (you need one too)
Who is your friend
She don't look nice (no, no, no)
But I know she will
Later on tonight
Come on, let's get down

[Chorus: Raquel Saddiq]
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down, let's get down

[Verse 5: DJ Quik]
Ha, ha
Now I'm at the club
And I'm off that drug
The one they call alcohol got me acting y'all
I hump two freaks before I hump two more
And now I'm throwing up my guts out the car door
Over-consumption, you know how it is y'all
Got your homey beggin' for some Pepto Bismol
But when my stomach's right I'll be back tonight
To get that lady I was grinding on the wall
Feel me

[Bridge: Raphael Saddiq]
Now that I feel
Now that I feel a little better than I felt a little while ago, yeah
I'm going back to the same spot
Where I met you on the floor
Now table one, that's my folks
And table two, that's my folks
And everybody knows my name (What's up, Saddiq?)
Now table three, that's B. Grund
And table four that's G-One
You best be prepared
'Cause it's on again, you know

[Alt. Chorus: Raphael Saddiq]
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet

[Interlude: D'Wayne Wiggins]
I gotta get my groove on (keep movin' and groovin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
I gotta get my groove on (keep movin' and groovin', movin' and groovin')
I gotta get get my groove on (keep shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass)
I'm groovin' (say what?)
Movin' (yeah)
Yeah

[Chorus (x2): Raphael Saddiq]
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet (down, down, down)
Come on, let's get down, let's get down, let's get down
Come on, let's get down
In my black Chevrolet (down, down, down)
