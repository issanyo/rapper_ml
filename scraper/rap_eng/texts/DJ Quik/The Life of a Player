[Gangsta D]
The life of a player, ain't no simple task
Best believe you gotta watch yo' ass
Cause niggas and bitches stay on yo' shit
Just waitin' for a nigga to hit
But a player like me got my own game plan
And that's why I keep the upper hand
And this is the reason why I sell this
To keep you motherfuckers jealous
They can't cope with a nigga like me
Tha D - the motherfuckin' G
Now won't you come and catch a grip
And bitch, get my dick off your lip
And tell your niggas to get back
Before somethin' happenin'
Like you gettin' pimp slapped
Thinkin' of a true star
You'll come out with P-L-A-Y-E-R
The Player...

[KK]
The life of a player
Straight out the money, bail to the bank
The upper high class where a nigga rank
And people always try to say they feelin' it
Then wanna come with the bullshit
I don't wanna deal with a bitch on a get-rich-quick plan
Tryin' to make a player be her man
And the niggas on the nut jock roll
Bein' a ho for a player
They might as well be on a stroll
Bring the 'K back a fat end
Just so they could be my friend
I don't accept it, I'll look you over then check it
There's another nigga who feels neglected
The punk and the bitch in a broke role
Will I ever go back to? (Hell nah)
I think I'll stick to the lick that got me rich
Slangin' this dick - the life of a player...

"..an old, off the street pimps con game" *scratched*

[Gangsta D]
Bitches, niggas, the whole nine yards
Try to search for the play on the boulevard
The coolest nigga on the scene
Now he live his life like a king
He never rolls undercover
Cause yo, he's a bad motherfucker
Thinkin' of jackin' my friends
Hmmm, you better think again nigga
See few have only been chosen
But this young player has rosen
With a different bitch every night
Bitches give up the pussy because they don't like to fight
And when he's done they remember the door
Cause they know they gotta go
He'll do ya know and see ya later
That's right bitch, this is the life of a player...

[Outro: KK]
Hoes up and tramps down
Niggas all around
Money in the bank, bitch
Yeah, that's right
This is the life of a player...
