[DJ Quik]
And just when you motherfuckers thought it was over
I'm back up in this motherfucker..

"You better get ready"
"for-for-for for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name, boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
"You better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Doin' much damage in the ninety-two
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[Verse 1]
Now DJ Quik is the nigga that's comin' up real thick
I'm a stone funkaholic yet I don't need Schick
Because there ain't another nigga more versatile
DJ Quik been bustin' funky rhythms all the while
And this song is for the homies who was down with me
When I was broke as a joke, flat with no mon-ey
And to them doubtin-ass motherfuckers, 'cause they don't know, yeah
Instead of showing and proving, yo, I'm proving that I'm the show
Now who wants to fade this modern day prophet?
Take two steps forward, one shell and you're dropping
Because I don't go toe to toe, I go ho to ho
Yo' ho is so-so, so yo, I think I better let her go
'Cause she ain't worth my time
And before I get off into another rhyme
I'mma bring this verse to a climax, grab the axe
Open the door, clear the floor, and make way

"for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name, boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
[Quik]	Sucker ass niggas can't fade me
"You better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
"Quik" "What kind of name is that for a nigga?"
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"

[Verse 2]
Now when I say I'm complete;
That means I'm true to my game and my cap
And I refrain from being played like a sap
And a bitch?  No bitch can handle what I'm kickin'
They say I'm trippin but they stick around my room for a dickin
'Cause the power of the Quiksta's too overwhelming
And when you let me rip, I'm going in with a helmet
That's why your little brother wants to be like me
I'm surrounded by the trueness that suckers fail to see
Now 2nd II None, is you down with the Quik?
("What you think?")
Mr. Bacon, is you down with the Quik? ("Yeah, you know it")
Playa Hamm, is you down with the Quik?
("Oh, but of course, playa")
And everybody else.. {".. can get the dick"}
Now on my last album, I said I rolled too motherfuckin' deep
That was for them suckaz that was tryin to creep
But peep the real - that when I got that murderin' feelin'
I can take a loss and make a killin' and still be

"America's most complete artist"
[Quik] Fuck these punk ass niggas!
"You-you-you better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
"for America's most complete artist"
[Quik] Doin much damage C-P-T style
"You better get ready"
"for America's mo-mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist-ar-ar-artist"
[Quik] Yo fuck the bridge
I better take y'all into the canal, kick it

Mo pussy, mo pussy, mo pussy..

[Verse 3]
Damn!  That's how a nigga like me is
True to it, ain't faking for the showbiz
All the true ass niggas, yup, ya know this
But the others jock-jockin' me like they ho is
'Cause DJ Quik can be as funky as the dook-shoot
Stutter steppin with pep but still I manage to giving the suckaz
The BOOT if they ask for it, because they know I flow it
Need I say more?  "NO!"  Well that's it

"for America's most complete artist"
"You better get ready"
"for America's most complete artist"
"What's your name, boy?"
"I.. am.."	"America's most complete artist"
"You better get ready"
"for America's mo-mo-mo
Most complete artist-artist--artist"
