[Hook: Dwele]
You wanna be right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I want to touch you
You moving it right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I wanna touch you

[Verse 1: Dwele]
So you getting high, girl
You  try to bend your face
You tryna find a place  a little cooler
Don't nobody give a damn about
The fact that you're super, man girl
Ain't holding this, falling to the floor
Truth be told I find it a little sexy
That you have got to stop
And move the half of  from your back
To the left
Drop your body every five steps
Love the way you wind your breath
Lips so thin

[Hook: Dwele]
You wanna be right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I want to touch you
You moving it right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I wanna touch you

[Verse 2: Dwele]
Sweat on your body, baby
And your tattoos turning
Stimulate Dwele
Let me help you shake those
My technique is cold, girl
Come on, let me show ya
Stand right here, and move your body
I won't ignore any place that made your (?) bad
Girl don't get it screwed up
I'm just a laid back guy
Don't ask your momma bout my kind
I'm gone do my thing, baby

[Hook: Dwele]
You wanna be right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I want to touch you
You moving it right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I wanna touch you

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Yeah, you know what to do now
Hands up, drinks in the air, we cool now
Banging on your radio since 19 ooh wow?
Guess that's a mighty long time
To get you down, but we still down
Dwele and Quiksta, it's so automatic
And you can't get us, we too acrobatic
The R&B's best kept secret
And I'm magic
And I been playing 21 since fourteen
Maybe since chicken head
You got to get up and leave now
Or cut some chicken wings or something
If you think you gone kick it with me
Yeah baby, you got some body waiting on you at home
Like you was popping out last night
On the dance floor wiling
Had your boy smiling
Saying she was going down
Like I just discovered an island

[Hook: Dwele (x2)]
You wanna be right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I want to touch you
You moving it right
If this is the side
I'm touching tonight
I wanna touch you

[Outro: DJ Quik]
Yo, check this out
I want all the ladies to put your hands in the air
Martini glasses high above your head
And let me see you dance
Without spilling one drop
If you can do that , to this track
You better than  I thought
Cause it's Dwele
Doing what we do, naturally
