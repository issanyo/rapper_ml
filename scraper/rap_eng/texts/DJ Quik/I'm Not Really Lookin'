Tonight I wanted to start
Do what came to do, but...
I see you checkin ya tweeta
I'm not really checkin for you
I want to sit back, enjoy maybe grab a drink or two
(That's what I've come to do)
So don't come spend cus that's not what I'm about
Not tonight, I'm coooool, baby

[Hook]
No I'm not really lookin'
Just came to have good time
Don't wanna get to serious
That's not what's on my mind
No I'm not really lookin
That's not what's in my plan
Don't want to leave with you tonight
Not looking for no man

Anotha day and a night
In the club tryin to get away from my wife (Oh yeah)
With my nephews, introduce 'em to a mad world (Look)
And I saw you side stepping you's a bad girl (Check you out)
Look at cha sittin on a stool at the bar
You's a young star
With ya, own crib, own chips and own car
But you starin at my nephew R
Like ya makin me jealous
But ain't knowin we fellas (Wait) what you tryin tell us?
You must be thinking that my mack ain't right
I'm pimpin ya turning ya back, baby you ain't right
You better aks this bartender
That be holdin the Platnum American Express Corporate
With stars in 'em
With that cris in ya clutch
Whole bottle, full throttle doin too much
How come we can't get into some double shit (What's up?)
Some of that old "Get Nekkid" get in trouble shit, huh?

[Hook]
No I'm not really lookin'
Just came to have good time
Don't wanna get to serious
That's not what's on my mind
No I'm not really lookin
That's not what's in my plan
Don't want to leave with you tonight
Not looking for no man

[Truth Hurts]
Cus it's a party and I'm not trying to start
Ho babe, don't be wanna make 'em shut down the spot
Oh no, so baby pull out
That's not-this is about
Come feel me on this long
I'm not stressin

[Hook](2x)
No I'm not really lookin'
Just came to have good time
Don't wanna get to serious
That's not what's on my mind
No I'm not really lookin
That's not what's in my plan
Don't want to leave with you tonight
Not looking for no man

No man, no man
Noooo...no man
No oh oh oh
Fuck it where's my drink
Not looking
