Come here baby close to me
Let's indulge in fantasies
Loving you, you loving me
(And I know)
That the feeling flows so naturally
Let's take a trip out of galaxy
Our chemistry is heavenly
(For Real)
Brown suga you got soul
Let the love spirit take control
Free your mind and let it go
Fast
Slow
Open up to the high on up
Relax
Float
You and I gon touch the sky
