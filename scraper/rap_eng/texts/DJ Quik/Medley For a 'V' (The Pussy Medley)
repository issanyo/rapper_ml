[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Ayo, G-One, I've been listening to this nigga Quik album
And he ain't got no songs about the pussy
You know that nigga gotta have something about the pussy on
This shit, you feel me?
And I'm just that nigga to beat the pussy up
So, uh, if you feel me like I feel you, ya know what I'm sayin'
Let me get a little piece of this thang here like that there
Trip...

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let a nigga from the E.S. L.B. D.P
Beat that pussy 'til it's soft and mushy
I love that bushy, and most niggas still do
Unless that bitch shit smells like mildew
We'll do damn near anything to get it
And once I got it, I'm outtie, I stay 'bout it
I sip a little tea then light up my weed
I slip on my rubber out the cover then I proceed
To give your little thick ass what you need
Gangsta gangsta, I'll make ya cootie cat scream
Didn't I turn ya on like a phone?
You lovin' that Doggy Dogg meaty bone
When ya moan, ya whole voice tone
Make me wanna put my bizalls in ya jizaws, and y'all
Know what I'm gettin' at, I'm spittin' at
Nigga wanna fuck, trick; so what's up, bitch? (biotch)
See as long as my muthafuckin' dick get hard
And I got a million dollars banked out on my credit card
No disrespect or no disregard
But I'm hoppin' for that pussy like they used to hop for cars
My nigga DJ Q told me come on through
'Cause he got a gang of bitches that was down to do
Keep it poppin' since I'm from the big LBC
That's right down the street from Compton
I pop in the liquor store to grab some hay
A bag of ice, some blue dice, and some Cognac
Yeah, the pussy's good
Especially when it's from a whole 'nother neighborhood
How good do it get when you on that G shit?
I'm strokin' that pussy 'til that bitch seasick
We dick bitches down and that's Rule #3 in the Dogg Pound
Bitch, drawers down!

[Snoop singsong]
We won't get no radio play
But we probably get some pussy for this (What you say?)
I said we won't get no radio play
But we probably get some pussy for this

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate

[Verse 2: Hi-C]
Uhh, baby, let's sip wine while we 6-9
I'll slide on this rubber and we'll be just fine
Now if my condom broke and my ass got smoked
I'ma still get to Heaven on a little rubber boat, uhh
Snoop hit it then I hit it too
Aww yeah, little bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout you
Now all you ever do is sit around and boo-hoo
Talkin' 'bout, "Hi-C, I loved-ed-ed you!"

[Verse 3: AMG]
She said, "Where ya been?"; I said, "In ya mouth"
If you're lookin' for love then take me down south
And I'll tell you all the things to make ya laugh and giggle
While I insert my eight inch shaft up in your tender vittles
A hot pocket, Snoop Dogg told me to stop it
He heard me in the other room bangin' her womb
And baby better do me like I'm one in a million
Check yo' feelings, and point that ass to the ceiling
'Cause I'm the "dick 'em down king"; call me on the celly, let it ring
And prepare your lips for the ding-ding
And if you got some friends, let 'em bend on over
While I ride 'em like a '98 Rover
You can wish and you want, but this dick you're gonna meet
Hit your elbows and knees and spread your booty cheeks
And call me Daddi with a "I"
Girl, you're doin' everything by the book
Nate Dogg, tell 'em how she looked

[Verse 4: Nate Dogg]
Girl, you're lookin' fine, so fine
I wonder if you'd like to take the time to grind
If so, why don't you leave with me today, let's play
This game I call it touch a secret place, let's play
See, first I just grab ya from behind ya mine
And then I just push until I find that line
By now, I know you've came a couple of times, that's fine
As long as you know I have to leave in time
You can't be...You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate
You can't be, can't be, you can't be my lady
But I'll let you be, let you be my playmate

[Verse 5: Gangsta D]
Now ain't nothin' like tight pussy on my dick
It's the Gangsta D, baby, never saved a trick
Got a harem full of hoes, mashin' to the studio
For all my niggas, you will get busy, ho
Now the first bitch she want dick to the tonsils
My second and third wanna fuck on the console
My fourth start to leak like the dookie chute shot
While my money-maker walking the stroll for my knot
Got that bitch mouth smellin' like fresh cock

[Verse 6: KK]
Young twatâ€”if I can smell it, I'mma tell ya to get going
With a douche pack, you're makin' my nose react
Reekin' but that ain't tweed or no yak
More like 25 pounds of get back
And I can tell by ya walk, it's talk back
But if that ain't yo' case, let me take a ride
On your love rollercoaster, pull them panties aside
KK

[Verse 7: El Debarge]
I'mma lean it to the left and to the right
And I'mma make ya scream and holla for more
And I bet you when I'm in it, you can't help but to admit it
You ain't never came this good before
Chevis-Regal got my dick so hard
I ain't gon' make it to the house because that's too far
Mr. Quik give me the keys to the Benzo
So I can hit it right here on the E-Lo Haaaaa Baaaaby
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light
I'mma get some pussy tonight, soon as you turn off the light

[DJ Quik: vocals all reversed]
Ha ha
Now I be still be knocking bitches like it ain't shit
Almost 10 years later but I still slang dick
And my penis, is like Venus, it's far away
And it's not butter, baby, more like Parkay
As we bounce to the city that you, used to know
The CPT with AMG, and all the bitches roll
We gon' be fly all the way G-ride
As we dip-dip-di, I shoot it in your eye
'Cause pussy ain't a thang to me
And my nuts when, they hang, they be okay to me
'Cause I'm a fly type of nigga; yeah, it's bigger
If you seen it on the muthafuckin microscope, it's bigger
Ha-ah-ah-ahahahah, in reverse like a muthafucka
Watching muthafuckas crash on that ass
Police videos, fuckin' all these hoes
I don't sunset with the hoes and shit
The pimps, girls, and the prostitutes
The prostitutes running from the police
It ain't nothing but a three P on me
Mr. Dante, baby, don't you see
Can we flip, flip the shit back over let me hear it
I like the reverse, sounding good in my ear
Crazy, this shit is crazy
