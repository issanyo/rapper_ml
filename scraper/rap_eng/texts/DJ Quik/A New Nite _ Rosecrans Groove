[Part I: A New Nite]

[Intro: Problem]
Is that my fucking pager going off?

[Hook: Shy Carter]
Big city, big city, big city
Forty links, Forty stares
Everytime I come 'round
Oh so ready for whatever
Cause it can go down
Cause these streets don't love nobody
And these hoes don't love nobody
And these streets don't love nobody
But themselves

[Verse 1: Problem]
I'm just tryna spread love through these Compton streets
Hit DJ Quik, need a Compton beat
Fuck around and have babies with some Compton freaks
Real beef has wings, you'll be gone in weeks
Street shit like sight [?] stay on my toes
Lotta niggas start hating when you fucking these hoes
Lotta niggas start hating when you getting the cash
Everyday gotta stuff more cash in the stack
Black bitches with titties, white bitches with ass
Hit the chach with a knock, I put my boy on the lick
Brought it back like a G, Rolls out of the shit
Knew some niggas girls back when they was swallowing dick
So they remember the times Michael Jackson know
These niggas know I fuck so they flexing though
Now a nigga think he gotta be mad at me
Keep it cool though you know my niggas blast happy

[Hook: Shy Carter]
Forty links, forty stares
Everytime I come 'round (tonight)
Oh so ready for whatever
Cause it can go down (tonight)
Cause these streets don't love nobody
And these hoes don't love nobody
And these streets don't love nobody
But themselves

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Now this the kinda beat that I might need Dre on
Them 14 hours studio sessions, I'mma stay on
The kind of on that makes you go higher and higher
I sleep when I'm dead I come alive when I'm tired
Now this the kind of beat I make when I'm just dippin'
The bassline sound like my fingers set-trippin'
On what better spot the El Segundo and Central
This the intersection that made me make instrumentals
I got haters in the outfield lookin' at me
I got ladies in the front row looking OG
I got a stiff pair of Levi 501s in my britches
And got a stiff third leg for when I doggy my bitches
I got a working record label, what the hell y'all got?
I got Jimmy Purple Haze, what the hell y'all got?
And I still own the equipment that brought my deal
But smart enough to buy multiples cause y'all niggas steal

[Hook: Shy Carter]
Forty links, forty stares
Everytime I come 'round (tonight)
I'm so ready for whatever
Cause it can go down (tonight)
Cause these streets don't love nobody
And these hoes don't love nobody
And these streets don't love nobody
But themselves

[Verse 3: Problem]
Problems gon' come you gotta deal with them
Fake niggas stop politicin' on real niggas
Talking greezy on motherfuckers that kill with him
Snitch right on his partner then go and chill with him
Right at his momma house like nothin' happened
Cops hit his momma house while his granny nappin'
Hoes make niggas turn to somethin' else
There gotta be a better way shit is somethin' else
Cause this balling just ain't gon' stop no time soon
No, oh, oh, so you might as well get into the money like I do
Woah, woah, woah

[Hook: Shy Carter]
Forty links, forty stares
Everytime I come 'round (tonight)
Oh so ready for whatever
Cause it can go down (tonight)
Cause these streets don't love nobody
And these hoes don't love nobody
And these streets don't love nobody
But themselves

[Refrain]
She let him roll that ass
Shake it to the floor
And when she shake that ass
The DJ hit it next
She likes it Compton
She likes it Compton
She let him roll that ass
Shake it to the floor
And when she shake that ass
The DJ hit it next
She like it Compton
She likes it Compton
