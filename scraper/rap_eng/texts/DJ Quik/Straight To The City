[Intro]
Yo, come on

[Hook: Problem]
Check a check and go straight to the city with it
High enough to see my whole city's limits
Silly gimmicks ain't too many in my city with it
My city with it if you doubt it, nigga come and get it

[Verse 1: Problem]
Everything you niggas mimic, bruh my city did it
Lost so many to them semi's over Philly fitteds
The city hot, pray the Lord come and chilly chitted
Let one knee hit the floor so he really feel it
Check a check then go straight to the city with it

[Interlude 1]
105 East, let's see who's really with it
Nigga
It's like let's hit the 105, see who's really with it

[Hook: Problem]
Check the check and go straight to the city with it
High enough to see my whole city's limits
Silly gimmicks ain't too many in my city with it
My city with it if you doubt it, nigga come and get it

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh

[Verse 2: Problem]
If you from the city then I know you get it
Every list ever written has my city in it
Good to bad many hats, yeah my city fitted
Niggas heads go grah when that billi hit it
These police on the loose, these police on the loose
These police shoot your tooth right there on the news
Allowin' you to hang then they toss a noose
Pop one in they heads till they call a truce
Pick up a bitch then go straight to the city with it
Kiss her neck then go straight to the tity with it
Kiss her neck then go straight to the kitty with it

[Hook: Problem]
Check a check and go straight to the city with it
High enough to see my whole city's limits
My whole city's limits
The whole city feel it

[Interlude 2]
Shit nigga who really with it
Here that punk ass talk nigga, who really did it
(?)
Shit, squad

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohh, ohhh, ohhh
