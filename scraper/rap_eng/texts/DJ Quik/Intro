I just wanted to be the first to say that 2Pac was a really nice man. He was fly, 'yall. He was mellow, but at the same time he could be Rikers Island wild. He's a very tight dude, man. Of course you already knew that through the music you could tell what he's about. He tried to change the game, fix it and my lil' homie's life was cut short for some bullshit. And I miss him. I never want to make no money off of you 'cause I love you so much. I wouldn't even put records we did together on my album. Do you feel me?
