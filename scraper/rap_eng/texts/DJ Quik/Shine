[Chorus]
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me grind
They don't wanna see me get it
They don't wanna see me live
Ask these niggas why you trippin'?
Why you all up in my time?
Niggas go hate
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
Say they don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine
They don't wanna see me shine

[Verse 1: David Blake II]
We gon' shine anyway, believe that
It's David Blake nigga (yeah)
Gotta kick my feet up for snicks
Tell you 'bout my grind and why I be here for a minute
They be on my time and that's just somethin' I can't play wit'
They just see me doin' it
Been 'round these different places, yeah
Nigga we don't know whatchu been on
I don't ever trust nobody, you can kick it on my phone
You gon' always see me shine cause I been beamin' in that [?]
I just know my time is comin', you gotta get wit' it
Too fly, yeah she immature, two eyes wit' a great view
Blessed niggas, should I bless you?
Got my cape on to the rescue
Save them hoes I won't do that
I been ridin' clean, you shoulda knew that
I blow up, don't get blew back
And that's real shit I spit two facts
This is what I'm on, this is who I am
I just be flyin' wide-awake at 2 am
They don't wanna see me shine, well that's okay
These niggas ain't stoppin' me and you know what?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
George Foreman microphone, this that German shit
The hoes hit me on it, make me wanna sperm and spit
So they treat me like a permin' kid
I straighten them hoes out
And make them hookers earn this dick
I'm a feng shui nigga
Get me in the club, I'm a rum-straight nigga
It ain't no problem totin' champagne bottles
Now cork 'em all and toast 'em to the player on the grottle
Porsche, I'm in the backseat, too much room for my feet
The benefit to when the DJ's the chef, anytime we go eat
I chop these niggas and cut 'em
Step on they shoe and headbutt 'em
I'm gangsta like no wanksta's like
We don't think alike so nigga fuck 'em
I'm shinin' all through my gold
An archi-pimp and I'm cold
If I like it then I love it
If I look good in it, you need to wrap the bitch cause I'm sold
But you say
Thinkin'
Hatin'
Plottin'
Well if you case me wit' it, then you ain't gon' get it
Niggas green with envy, you a toad

[Chorus]
