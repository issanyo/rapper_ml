[Verse 1: Mausberg]
Now if it ain't the P-funk, dog it just ain't me
I'm used to ridin' in the vroom, with a bride and bumpin' Biggie
Poppin' my collar, top-notch, big dollar
Sharp as a tack, my gators about to attack
It's the return of the big and spiffy
California, shiny white walls on them gold Daytonas
Bitches flaggin' me down, because I'm lookin' all good and stuff
But I didn't stop cause baby wasn't lookin' good enough
I'm on some other shit, Cubans in paradise
Nuttin' but dime bitches and niggas havin' they own cheese
And we gon' party in the player's ball
And don't forget to bring yo' baddest bitch
Cause pimpin's involved

[Chorus]
Celebratin' for my playa-playas (that's for you)
Coast to coast, propose a toast
A little something for my pimpallstics (and that's for you)
East or West, we doin' the best
A celebration for my playa-playas (and that's for you)
Coast to coast, propose a toast
A little something for my pimpallstics (and that's for you)
East or West, we doin' the best

[Verse 2: Mausberg]
Now baby you got life and bullshit twisted
I ain't that type, nigga
Bomb bitches, platinum and gold, trick 'em out riches
I'm a pimp and playa for life, bloody crap shooter
I studied niggas like Chubb Rock, Turkey Wayne, and Gooba
Ain't nuthin' fake about it, only guns bust bullets
I'm from the set, if ya got it, better do more than pull it
Sprung on a pussy nigga, better call quits
Went from pimpin' the bitch to dressin' like twins and shit
I'm the playa, the big baller, shot caller
Other niggas breakin' you off, then why bother?
Never jumpin' outta character
Especially for a bitch that's too cute to pute
Baby you can get the boot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Mausberg]
Y'all ain't ready for Maussy to get flossy on the credits
I take a point from a bitch, but gettin' big headed
If you ain't comin' with half or better, I'm going solo
And you fucking the Berg is a no go
Celebrity dick is far from free
And I don't think it's a bitch costin' me and hard for me
I'm on some top-notch pimpallstic shit
I'll make ya break ya self, fo' a piece of this dick
Gotta get the chips, I can make my own self nut
I jack off then blast off in a plastic cup
So back up, this dick is V.I.P
And have price for the bitches just to talk to me

[Outro]
A celebration for my playa-playas
Coast to coast, propose a toast
A little something for my pimpallstics
East or West, we doin' our best
(4x)
Yeah
