[Playa Hamm]
Did you miss me?
It took a little time to get sucka-free
But since a young G, it's PPC
Ain't no shame in the name
And still true to the game
Still servin' suckers just the same
No sense in dwellin' in the past tense
I roll with pimps, so you better check your ladies, gents
Cause I'mma teach her how to break you, right before I break her
After I make her, then I shake her
Yeah, I know, you heard it all before
But I can't deal, 'cause I see you're still simpin' for a ho
Claimin' pimp, but you're payin' for the pu'
Silly sucker, punk muthafucka
They only flock and jock
'Cause you're fillin' up they pocketbooks
And you're still judgin' hookers by they looks
When it's really all about what she can do for you
Or do for me and still see a True
Ah-ha. Really? Do you hear me, bro?
Got my name all on your lips when your chick trips
Oh no, never will I lower to your level
And I got 17 for ya, devil
Too True to ever let a sucker like you
Make me do somethin' that I don't wanna do
I'm still real with it, you gots to deal with it
I serve that ass like a cluck and I don't give a fuck
'Bout who you're doin', how you're doin' or what you do it with
You better miss me with the dumb shit
So when you speak up on the Playa Hamm or my nigga Quik
Everybody knows you're suckin' on a fat dick
It ain't nothin' to nuttin' in your eye so that you see clear
Boomin' in your ear, so I know you hear
Bump this in your Coupe with your R&B wanna-be-me
Trick-ass, I'm sucka-free
