[Verse 1]
Look at me—can you read my face?
Can you see the love in me?
So you see it—was I the one to blame?
Boy, you are a mystery
I can’t let go, so take this heart of mine
(Can’t let go) Ooh yeah
Just let tlove flow, let me in your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong? Can’t you see that I got feelings too?
I need you—I need you, baby

[Chorus]
I won’t let the rain come down (I won’t let the rain)
Unless I’m there to dry you up (Ooh, my baby, no)
I won’t let the rain come down
Unless I’m there to dry you up

[Verse 2]
Love’s so blind, too blind for you to understand
(Why won’t you give in to me)
Don’t wanna cry, I need your security
(In your arms I wanna be)
I can’t let go, so take this heart of mine
(Can’t let go) Oh, my baby, yeah
Ooh, just let love flow, and let me in your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I wrong? Can’t you see that I got feelings too?
I need you—I need you, baby

[Chorus]
I won’t let the rain come down (I won’t let the rain come down)
Unless I’m there to dry you up (I’m gonna be there for you, baby)
I won’t let the rain come down
Unless I’m there to dry you up

[Guitar solo and harmonizing]

[Chorus]
I won’t let the rain come down (I won’t let the rain)
Unless I’m there to dry you up (I’m gonna be there for you)
I won’t let the rain come down (No no, no baby)
Unless I’m there to dry you up (I’m gonna be there for you)
I won’t let the rain come down
Unless I’m there to dry you up (I won’t let the rain come down, baby)
I won’t let the rain come down (I’ll be there for you, baby)
Unless I’m there to dry you up (I’m gonna be there for you)
I won’t let the rain come down (I won’t let the rain)
Unless I’m there to dry you up
I won’t let the rain come down (I won’t let it fall on you, baby)
Unless I’m there to dry you up

[Outro]
I wanna be there when you need me…
