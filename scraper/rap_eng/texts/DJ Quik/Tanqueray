[Verse 1]
Huh, now don't come to my party if you don't wanna get drunk
It's me and my niggas and we puffin on the skunk
'Cause it's true when I'm bent and I'm fuckin I can last long
With some Gin and a grin 'cause I'm cock strong
Now don't trip ho, you like to get bent too
Hit the Thai, run, get ya coochie run up in too
By a nigga that'll make ya sick
You know me *scratch*[D]*scratch*[J]*scratch* [Quik], Yeah
Now let me tell you about a party that I threw last year
Niggas kept hollerin' that "Party over here"
Too many niggas so I had to get a keg of Budweiser
But it had me pissin' down my leg
So I bought somethin' that'll last longer
Somethin' a little harder, somethin' a little stronger
Somethin' that'll definitely make your day
So what you say muthafucka, want some Tanqueray?
Now the niggas up on it went got some orange juice
'Cause they know that Tanqueray'll get them hoes loose
Fillin' up your glass, boy, you tryin' to trip
Nigga, you can't have no full glass, fool, take a sip
But I'm not stingy so I filled it to the rim
He went up in my kitchen with a bitch named Kim
Straight bareback in the pussy he dove
Huh, bustin' nuts all on my stove
From drinking that..

[Hook]
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

[Verse 2]
Now the party started jumpin' and the music got loud
A hand full of niggas done turn into a crowd
Out of my control, the party started hoppin'
And the more that niggas drunk, the more that started droppin
Shit, my house got fucked up for certain
With beer on my carpet, gum on my curtain
Niggas in my front yard bendin' up the fence
Havin' a fuckin' great time all at my expense
But I can't trip because I'm knowin'
Niggas gon' be niggas and that's just the way shit's goin'
But 'bout damn time I got a visit from the crew
Playa Hamm and Shabby Bleu
With some bitches hollerin' (Hey, where the party at?)
I said "The party's in my pants if ya monkey's kinda fat"
"Naw, I'm just bullshittin', come on in"
Now it was two bad bitches, but they had an ugly friend
Then the ho decided that she wanted to dance
Spilled Boone's Farm, all on my pants
Plus she was funky like a Figuero' ho
But I didn't say a goddamn thing 'cause I didn't know
Then she a trip and started havin' a fit
Talking about (All y'all rappin' niggas ain't shit)
So I spit in her face and socked the ho in lip
And dragged the bitch outta my tip
'Cause I was full of that..

[Hook]
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray

[Verse 3]
Check it
Now the bitch straight skated, but then she rolled back
Came up in my party wit a strap, cocked it
Jack, spotted it, hit her on the head and speedknotted it
Bitch dropped the strap and I got it
Rat pack time, niggas, stop
The lights came on and the bitch got dropped
It was party over here and party over there
'Til the niggas tripped and started pullin' out her hair
Now, it really wasn't nice to see
When they beat the bitch down, and drag her ass out in the street
And you ain't getting your gat back, shawty
Put it in my pocket, went back to the party
And everybody kicked it for the rest of the night
Huh, bud straight fazin' and the vibes was right
Wasn't no more scrappin', everything was okay
'Til everybody up and skated 'cause we was outta that..

[Hook (x2)]
Tanqueray'll have ya feelin' so fine
Little green bottle got you outta ya mind
So if you want to get bent in a big ol' way
Come on and drink a little Tanqueray
