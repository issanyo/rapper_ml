[Intro: DJ Quik]
Yo, this is DJ Quik
And quite frankly
I think we gotta be some of the baddest motherfuckers
That ever fucked with rap music
Cause this album right here is on some old cool shit
If you don't believe me
Just give me three and a half seconds and I'll show you
You ready?

One, one and a half
Two, two and a half
Three, three and a half, uh
Yeah
Got my niggas 2nd II None up in this bitch
My nigga Peter Gunz, that's right
AMG, El Debarge, Playa Hamm, Hi-C, Suga Free
Check this shit out

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
I'm like fries in a skillet—much too hot to hold
I'm strong and I'm handsome and black, plus I'm bold
A mental case, sometimes stressin' but then I flip
Because you got to go crazy on Hollywood for your grip
And you know ain't no room in my mirror for your face
And if I got y'all confused like Rubik then state yo case
Yet creepshow suckas keep tryin to submerge mine
But I can hold my breath for a long time
I emerge with treasures and coins, a thick sack
And your life ain't mine to take, now kick back
'Cause if it don't make dollas—sucka, you know the poem
Cause either you pimping this game or you just hoing
Now get up outta mine, nigga I'm the bomb
Droppin heat on your homeboys and spreadin like napalm
Cause I got more styles than your car's got miles
And I, got more styles than a hotel's got towels
Cause I kicks it in...

[Hook: DJ Quik]
So many ways (Uh huh and we can flip it in)
So many ways (Cause we can rock a party)
So many ways (Got bomb for everybody)
So many ways (Now baby can you feel it in)
So many ways (Cause you know we can deal it in)
So many ways (And I can make your body numb in)
So many ways (Cause you ain't never heard a nigga come)
So many ways (Ah hah, ah hah)

(Verse 2: Gangsta D of 2nd II None)
I'm chillin, mackin, stackin up these ends
I gots to check a knot, I gots no time for no friends
I bust a trick, make her bounce like a low-low
While I'm twisted off that bud, countin money at the mo-mo
No flow so, ain't no need to tell the po-po
Believe me bra', all the snitches get the fo-fo
Now here we come again with a brand new twist
On God, I rock the party like this
With so many ways to get paid, I hustle for days
The tenth of the month I get my government aid
And the used-to-be-crooks, I'm puttin money on they books
Cause satan got busy and many souls got took
We shook up the world I did it with my partner
For his sons and my daughter, you don't have to be no baller
To kick it with me, see, I stay real G
D forever feedin all you punk hoes misery

[Hook: Gangsta D]
So many ways (I can get busy)
So many ways (I gots to get the scrilly)
So many ways (We can have a mardi-gras)
So many ways (Cause I can rock the party y'all)
So many ways (Tell me can ya feel it in)
So many ways (I gots to make the dividends)
So many ways (You know I keep it real in)
So many ways

(Verse 3: KK of 2nd II None)
I was known for triple M shots and straight plottin
But hittin them hoes had me wastin up a knot
And all these figaros scrubs waitin to get hot
Now it's cool, you got your spot without that funky cot
And that dramatic experience you and him went through
Ain't got nothin to do with the K, so keep cool
Little girl, this ain't no Hollywood play
Go somewhere else and play them sucka games you play
Catch the redline metro rail, blaze a trail
I can feel you ain't real and I can tell
From meetin different people, fingers to throats
Scandalous to the rich, goodhearted to the broke
And these young and old folk, they like to hear good music
If it's weak lose it, but if it's bumpin choose it
But don't abuse it and try to take it to the brain
If you do you'll be caught up in a strain
And be hangin on my thang in

[Hook: KK]
So many ways (Now watch me put it down in)
So many ways (You know I like to get my clown in)
So many ways (We can flip the sound in)
So many ways (K and D got it humpin in)
So many ways (You know you wanna bump it in)
So many ways (We can have a mardi-gras)
So many ways (You know I rocks the party y'all)
So many ways

[Bridge]
So many ways (x8)

[Verse 4: Peter Gunz]
I walk three thousand miles for a taste of that gangsta shit
Messin around with G-One and the DJ Quik
Stick and move from east-west in vest like stocks
I went from pushin Nikes to pushin drops
Fuck around and go platinum quick, messin with Quik
Nigga got hits like Switch so watch your trick
See me playin Avirex and the Pepe's
No shirt on, your girl sweat me and I'mma hit it if she let me
Backsides bangin, hangin, all amazed
She get this dick in (So many ways)
Blow her back out then I mack out, freak the keys to the Lex
Or find me havin sex in my NSX
I'm from the BX but we flex from East to West
So while you niggas coast-trippin we'll be cashin them checks
Peter Gunz, one of the most in-credible ones
G-One, Quik, we rolls thick and gets the job done in

[Hook: Peter Gunz]
So many ways (Cause I kick it in)
So many ways (You know that I can flip it in)
So many ways (And I can rock a party)
So many ways (I got bomb for everybody)
So many ways (Bring it from the Bronx in)
So many ways (From New York to Compton)
So many ways (We keep it pumpin)
So many ways (Uh)

So many ways (x16)
