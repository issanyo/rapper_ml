[Intro]
Rendezvous, I guess it's time for another
Aww look what you muthafuckas done went and did
Y'all done pissed off
Yeah what up sis, I hear you out there
You know you done fucked up
I'm glad y'all set it off

[Verse]
You prolly mad 'cause you can't eat off me no more
Don't wanna hear you crying or offer you no dough
You tried to make my life shabby
With the zodiac sign of the cancer you crabby
Plus you got away with murder twice
Just like that nigga that's on thin ice

[Hook]

I hate you so much it just shows
I hate you more than Michael hated Joe
And your son looks like a fucking Al-Qaeda
I'mma call him Whop Daddy cause his chin to the side
Now that's the mark of the beast
You had a Damien in 1977 to say the least
Your house is full of mole, body full of yeast
I bet you baking a loaf of bread down between your cheeks
You stanky little rodent, yeah bitch, you molded
You'll never see your brother, that's why your love carroded
Emphysema all in him
You can't hold nobody, there ain't no toxins in your venom
You just a grand momma in denim
Looking for some little kids to put some shit up in them

[Hook]

The problem is you ain't have no fucking loyalty
And the only thing you wanted was my royalties
You stole a car and a bike from me
Looking back I was the caretaker of a dummy
And that husband of yours, you dumb witch
Was still a husband of hers you stupid bitch
You never acted your age
You only came to embarrass me out in public for days
That's why little clarity pays
You got the boot
Now I'm chipping like Frito Lays
Rest in peace to my niece, Elise
When she was lying in state, she had a grin on her mouthpiece
Now what that tell you about you
You disturb to the curb, and it's better without you

[Hook]

Fat boy know you really been dumming
Going over peewee house showing off your triple stomach
With a strap in your waist
Now what you gon do when you see my face, I doubt it
I'm tired of playing with you cocka roaches
I gave you bitches life and trust and you stupids broke it
Cause you a muthafuckin sex offender
Put some honey on your dick and put it in a blender
They caught you fucking on your sister's daughter
That some incestual shit, get the holy water
Compton Alumni, a-no go
Nigga you really Pasa Robles
Upstate in Y.A. Without your homeboys
Cheeking each other butts making no noise

[Hook]

If I bought you equipment and you sold it, that's on you
Help you get into a home and lose it, that's on you
You niggas acting like babies
You feeling entitled to another man's money, that's crazy
More like insane, schizophrenia
Struggles with love and money and happiness you get plenty of
While I'm staying fly like laguardia
I'm a guardian, I'm the auditor
I'm the flyiest mc that you ever heard
On the Norman microphone, motherfucker that's word
Now give me the mic and let me be heard
Cause I be quitting surely, I am the shep-herd
Now what you know about my lyrics and style
I got a Clicquot backwash, fly spit, we wild

[Hook]
