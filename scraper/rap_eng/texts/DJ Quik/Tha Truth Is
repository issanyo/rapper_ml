[Mausberg]
Y'all niggas 'bout to get it
Yeah, boy this only one of them tracks you can come up with Quik?
This shit bangin'
These niggas out here hatin' on us, homie
Why, when we doin' shit like this?
It's a cold thing homie, but you know that realism homie
I'm known for speakin' on that
You know, you done did your part
You done blessed me with some shit
This some of that get-back-at-me shit, but they can't
This your chronic?
Sheppard Lane Gangsters, and we the realest

You niggas stepped into a war that you ain't prepared for
A veteran ain't shit but a punk with heart before
I crumble niggas with my first mil
I bring beef to the streets nigga, fuck switchin' hills
I'm a certified real nigga, cock me back
Rap cats be gettin' slapped runnin' they traps
We the reason you niggas makin' floor patter tonight
Niggas wit' good attitudes and disposition tryin' to take flight
You niggas funny style, rich but a bitch
I'm a gangster and ain't about to take none of your bullshit
I'm from the hard knock block of the killas
God brought me the rap game, and I'll be damned if I ain't the realest
You better take care of your kids and quit playin' wit' a grown man
Before you be in dead man land
And it's a lot of bitch niggas on my target
Quik, they talk loud but can't finish what they started

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
Y'all be talkin shit (yup)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip
(Sure do) So you really need to button your lips
(Because the truth is...)  I hate you too (yes)
Y'all be talkin' shit (uh huh)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip
(You sure do) So you really need to button your lips
(Because the truth is...) I hate you too

[DJ Quik]
Now slow your roll punk for the nigga DJ Q-U-I-K
I break the beat down and make the motherfucker do what I say
Because it's my way or the highway, the super fly way
Regardless of what you fucken haters say
Now I done shared all my shit nigga, all my life
And I'm so fly nigga, I done even shared my --
So fuck a bitch and fuck you too, I ain't got no passes
I'm all out and I'm nuttin' up and it's time to whoop y'all asses
With a game that's see-through like cellophane and Scotch tape
And fuckin' with me nigga
Is like being on a hot date wit' a hoe with AIDS
I'm the virus and you kissed her, clown
I get up in you, set up, then I break your system down
So shut up, quit dissecting our name
Test pressin' our game, puttin' y'all name on it
But your and ours ain't the same
I take your bitch with a song and make her blow me
So fuck all my foes and (beep), you owe me

Chorus

[Mausberg]
I run through the biggest packs of niggas wit' my fist balled up
Ready for war now, unleashin' with dogs up
Rough, rugged and raw, puttin' hands on cowards
The one and only Mausberg with heart to devour
On some other shit, cripple a nigga wit' southpaw
Size sixteens in his ass, bloodclots in his jaw
Until I see my homie Jake again, fuck the whole world
God bless the little boys and girls
And I betcha I never turn my back on the streets
I studied the big book, so my past I never repeat
Real G's do real things, you ain't gotta bang
And ya album ain't the name of ya gang
This is real life, I only speak what I know
Flamed up on the daily, not because of a show
And Quik is my big homie, so you better step back
And recognize beef is more than bustin' a rap
Now take that

[DJ Quik]
Y'all be talkin' shit (yup)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip
(You sure do) So you really need to button your lips
(Because the truth is...) I hate you too
(Yup) Y'all be talkin' shit (uh huh)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip (what's up?)
So you really need to button your lips
(Because the truth is...) I hate you too (yeah)
Y'all talk a gang of shit (you sure do)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip (you ain't true)
So you really need to button your lips
(Because the truth is...) I hate you too (yup)
Y'all be talkin' shit (yeah)
But you won't be down when it's time to trip (uh huh)
So you really need to button your lips
(The fucken truth is...) I hate you too
