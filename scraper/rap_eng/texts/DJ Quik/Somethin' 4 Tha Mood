[Intro: DJ Quik]
This one goes out to my niggas
'Cause we be havin' to deal with these punk ass bitches
Check this out

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Hey bitch, you remember me
It's Mista DJ Quik from the Westside of the Tree
And you met me at 2001 Browning
That's where me and the PPC were just clownin'
Doin' what we had to do to get by
No money in my pocket but I was still fly
Curl to my neck but I got respect
And now I stack fat sacks and ride around in a Lex
And oh my, bitch, how you've changed
I see you rubbin' all on my dick and it's feelin' kinda strange
'Cause then you wouldn't even walk me around the block
But now your tryin' to throw me that tore up cock
I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole
I gots to keep the P in it, baby, muthafuck you hoes
But open up wide if you givin' up head
Because, close mouths don't get fed
I'm talking to you punk ass, trick ass, nuttin' ass bitches
What's the name of your perfume "Vicious"?
Hoes ain't shit, ain't gon' be, ain't never will be
And I'ma make you feel bad that you fucked me
So fast-forward, tricks, this is strictly for my dogs
Ballin' like a muthafucka, ragtop hogs
And El Co's keep rollin' to this gangsta shit
And when I feel like being bothered with you bitches
I'm givin' ya..

[Chorus]
Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin' (ya know)
With a proper bitch in my lap (ah...)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik + Playa Hamm]
Now it's 5:15 and I'm thinking about niggas Playa Hamm
Mr. Shabby Bleu and Big Jam
Hamm's at Gina's so I hit him on my mobile
'87 spinnin' so you know I gots the flows
Yo, what's up, nigga?
Yo, same ol', playa
Got some tenders, meet me over at Gina's a little later
Bookie Loc mobbin' through with D and a couple of half G's
So is you down for the skeeze?
I'm on my way
Now the bitches at Gina's, they all wanna see me
Put my telephone down for the LAPD
They passed me, I pass them, and they didn't even trip
Now I'm doin 55 over the Arlington Dip
And my Lexo's rollin', got me feelin' superior
With the funky white pearl and black leather interior
My niggas in my truck, we ain't givin a fuck
We caravanin' fast pace to 42nd place
Scooped up Bleu and headed back to the strip
In the left hand turnin' lane, niggas stare but donâ€™t trip
Bust a right on Normandie, the bitches blow for me
But I don't pay 'em no mind 'cause they come second to my homies
Hit the spot and bell' but I don't step in the mud
Walk up in the living room and it's smellin' like bud
In the kitchen where it ain't no drinks but a gang a food
Ahh, let me pop the trunk 'cause I brought a little...

[Chorus]
Somethin' 4 tha mood (yeah)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood (ya know)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap (mmm...)

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Now I dips to the studio to listen to the hits
2nd II None workin' on some brand new shit
And it's tighter that a muthafucka, got that swang
While Big Jake tryna take a nigga straight to Beijing
But I pass on the bud, I mash on the brew
Genuine Draft for my muthafuckin' crew
Tajai's chillin', China just trippin'
Chris engineering and Bacon and George sippin'
So listenin' to this track makes you understand
Why niggas still can't fuck with the one-man band
Got my dark locs clean with the P on my crown
And my black leather trench to the muthafuckin' ground
And I'm faded, knowin' I don't wanna drive drunk
In case I get jacked, got my shit in the trunk
Now I might have been swerving but I made it to the tip
Just another day in the life of Quik
I'm givin' ya...

[Chorus]
Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Something for the mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(And you know I got...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap
(I'm givin ya...)
Somethin' 4 tha mood (you know, baby)
Somethin' to get you in the groove
So sip that cognac and kick back
'Cause that's just what I'm doin'
With a proper bitch in my lap (and we up out)
