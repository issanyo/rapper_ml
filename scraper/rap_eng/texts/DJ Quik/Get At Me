[Intro]
(Now I got to cut ya...)
[scratches with "too Quik..."]
Yeah, ha ha, that's right
'Cause it's like this
Yeah, it's gotta be like this
Nigga

[Verse 1]
It used to be a CPT thang (what)
But now it's just an all me thang (yeah)
Because I'm tired of this gizame (right)
I'm through playin' for a crew that ain't got my back
When I'm the one who done created the sack
Mister You Know Who, remember me?
I met you when I was PPC
And you wasn't nothin' but a scrub
Wearin' plaid pants and bubble gums and beggin' for grub
But then when ya grip start growin'
You tripped and flipped and skipped out
Huh, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Not even thinkin' 'bout the time
When KK took yo' ass in 'cause you didn't have a dime
Nigga couldn't even say thanks for the trouble
I would've spanked yo' ass on the double
'Cause when ya didn't have a place to stay
You little round the way girl, my nigga took yo' weight
And that way all my homies had yo' back
Because together they knew we had a fat ass sack
But you couldn't stand the guns
Couldn't wait to take ya (Bitch betta have my) money and run
KK should've knew the motto of life (what's that?)
That ya can't turn a ho into a housewife (ha)
Because you left a lot of people unhappy
Nigga, you in debt ([KK] And ya need to get at me)
Yeah

[Chorus]
I know what you're sayin' (that's right)
I know what you're doin' (so ya need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (huh)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)

[Verse 2]
Now I can name a gang of niggas I done tripped with
Spent a grip with and they ain't spent shit
And they ain't never brought nothing to the table
But it ain't no puzzle, I'm able
But why you wanna take my kindness for weakness?
To get my money back, I gotta ride yo' ass like Preakness
It ain't that fly
And when ya see me in traffic, just ride by
You should've been a pigeon 'cause you duck so well
But next time I catch you I'ma pluck yo' tail
'Cause niggas like y'all show disrespect by flossin'
So you're in for a tossin'
You need to go brush your teeth
And change ya drawers and change ya sheets
And stop y'alls bitches
From steadily tryin' to ride on my meat
And start bathing more than once a week, nigga
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, bitches
So ya needs to come right with the quickness (come right)
And instead of tryin' to duck and dodge and be crafty
You need to get at me

[Chorus]
I know what you're sayin' (hell yeah)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (that's right)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)

[Verse 3]
So tell me how we gon' handle this
Either we gon' be men or we gon' be skanless
Either way is all right with me
'Cause I'ma show ya that I meant it
When I said that I'm a G, nigga
I don't take ganks too swell (naw)
That's why I went and bought a gang of shells
And if you approach me wrong, I'ma clown
First nigga run up [*gunshot*] ("First down")
Damn, I wish it didn't even have to come to this
'Cause now y'alls on my shit list
Right with the white boys in this game
Thinkin' they gone get the hits for some chump change
Please, huh, I didn't believe that you'll trip like that
That's how a gang of niggas flipped like that
So get back, fool, 'cause I'm going out
Comin' out of a straight jacket blastin' [*gunshot*]
And they gon' have to get at me

[Chorus]
I know what you're sayin' (hell yeah)
I know what you're doin' (you need to get at me)
I know what you're sayin' (Compton style)
I know what you're doin' (you know what, y'all can never get at me)
(Huh, up out...)

[scratches "too Quik" until end]
