[Intro]
Woah
Oh, man

[Verse 1: Boogie]
I hope you blessed in the city, get a vest in this city
If I hear you say "who next in this city" - oh shit
Best believe that a semi not on me while watching
Baby Boy screaming "yeah, that's what I won't be", poor Jody
It's more phony in your face, I've been riding on these brakes
They still telling me to "wait wait"
Hope when you say "wait' you tryna say I should get tipped more
Hope when you say "weight" you tryna say I need to bench more
Talkin' bout a wait, I been waitin' long as shit boy
Graveyard shifts for the days I'm tryna live for
Niggas out of shape and this that shit that they ain't fit for
How staying clean in this motherfucking shitstorm? *gunshots*

[Hook: Boogie]
That's why I'm yelling "Fuck, fuck, fuck 'em all!"
We used to have options
Then remembered that it's Compton and it's not
So we do it with not love involved
Said that I used to wanna give
When it was back when we was kids and we did
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said I used to wanna give, we was kids
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said we want it all

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I ain't do it for recognition, we the definition of godbody
It's two bodies on this wally [?] at first
It's where I'm the same nigga in person to keep squirting
After I seen murder my perspective is different, yeah
Real felon, they respected my slither
All this slime in this Styrofoam affecting my liver
My little sister got her fingers in the money bag
Do a show tomorrow, I promise the shit'll double back
In '05 I was high off of double stacks
Slidin' in a '89 Buick with a hundred pack
Lose a fist fight and then run it back
Lost a couple niggas I love, this shit come with that
Yeah, taught my niggas how run a trap
Blowin dope in a bounty, homie had to smuggle that
The streets love me and I love 'em back
Used to have love for the killer but lil' bro a rat

[Hook: Boogie]
That's why I'm yelling "Fuck, fuck, fuck 'em all!"
We used to have options
Then remembered that it's Compton and it's not
So we do it with not love involved
Said that I used to wanna give
When it was back when we was kids and we did
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said I used to wanna give, we was kids
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said we want it all

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Up in the studio with skeleton tracks
I’m pensive figuring out which one to finish
To try to stage a comeback
I feel it for a minute or two, then I’m indecisive
I break out over the speed limit on the 101 with no license
I know I’m one of the nicest and I ain’t suped
I know the difference between worthless and priceless
I raised so much hell about them potholes on Central
That Hub City startin' to plug 'em now, I'm so instrumental

[Hook: Boogie]
That's why I'm yelling "Fuck, fuck, fuck 'em all!"
We used to have options
Then remembered that it's Compton and it's not
So we do it with not love involved
Said that I used to wanna give
When it was back when we was kids and we did
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said I used to wanna give, we was kids
On my momma now we want it all
Yeah, I said we want it all
