[Verse 1: Christian Ford]
Oakland girls are mean
L.A. girls are so pretentious
Memphis girls are sweet
St. Louis are overprotective
New York girls are hard
Miami girls are soft
ATL girls are known for going all in

[Chorus: Christian Ford]
So I need a world girl
Someone to make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
Give me a world girl

[Verse 2: Christian Ford]
Canadian girls are prim
Russian girls are unpredictable
Japanese girls are slim
Australian girls are unrestrictable
African girls are hot
Alaskan girls are cold
By the end of the day, they know we going all in

[Chorus: Christian Ford]
So bring me a world girl
One that will make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
Give me a world girl

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Yeah, now I know these suckas wanna wreck your self-esteem
‘Cause he ain’t wait to wake you up from all of your dreams
But I just wanna see you whip around in Mercedes
And living in a Valley house just like the Bradys
You represent a player, gon’ be flyer than feathers
I never wanna hold you back, want you to be better
And I’m talking Mary, Essence, and Lisa, and Vanessa, and Meesha, and it’s sugar
Cincinnati redbones, Chi-town brown pieces, the keeper
The ones that make you look great
When you’re at the table and other bitches come in to hate
She’s not a creeper, but black pussy won’t wait
It’s pretty much the only thing that ain’t too great
When it’s deeper, so keep your eyes on me
Only put your thighs on me, make the others despise on me
‘Cause I’m selfish to a fault
Don’t want nobody else to see what’s in my vault

[Chorus: Christian Ford]
So bring me a world girl
One that will make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
One that will make my world go round and round
Someone to lift me up when I’m feeling down
Bring me a world girl
I want a world girl
Bring me a world girl
