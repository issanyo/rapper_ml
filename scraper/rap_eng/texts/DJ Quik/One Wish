[Verse 1: Deborah Cox]
Here I was rollin' in the car
I drove down past the park
Spotted a couple, wasn't trouble
They were doin' no harm
She leans down and kisses him on his lips
To give her love back, he rubs her hips
Oh, I could feel it, I felt their passion
Running through my warming veins

[Pre-Chorus: Deborah Cox]
So bad I wished that that was me
Make love like they do on TV
I see, all I seem to see
Yeah, is you and me
So bad I wished that that was me
Make love like they do on TV
I see, all I seem to see
Is you and me

[Chorus: Deborah Cox]
How I wished that could be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy

[Verse 2: Deborah Cox]
Now I'm not saying something's wrong with this relationship
But I know one thing, boy
It could be better
We have bedroom secrets sealed with a kiss
But nothing else compares to this
I'm talking about that real love, that true love
Can you feel me?

[Pre-Chorus: Deborah Cox]
Someday it will be you and me
Making love like they do on TV
I see, all I seem to see
Is you and me
Someday it will be you and me
Making love like they do on TV
I see, all I seem to see
Is you and me

[Chorus: Deborah Cox]
How I wished that could be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy

[Verse 3: Gangsta D]
With one exception, I'ma grant your wish
See, I'm diggin' your package, that's why I sealed it with a kiss
Homies ain't understanding it, they think I'm saving you, girl
Never taking you for granted 'cause I'm craving you, girl
See, my mental state is street life, I'm like a fantasy
Spontaneous on mine and turn your wish into reality
I greet you in the land of lovemaking
A true being true to you, you
Not even thinking about shaking a spot, we keep it steamy hot
Keep it full-blown, babyâ€”get it, get it, don't stop
Just you and me, baby, touching up stuff
Young D'll keep it going and make it ... like a ...
What, ain't it evident that them ... gon' be hatin' on us
Getting love twisted with lust
See, I smoke that drama but won't inhale it
And I could show you better than I can tell it

[Chorus: Deborah Cox]
(In this perfect love fantasy)
How I wished that could be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
How I wished that could be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
How I wished that could be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy
If I had one wish it would be
Baby, you and me
To become reality
In a perfect love fantasy

[Outro]
My one wish would be
For you to make sweet love to me
Like the first time
Baby, all the time, oh...
