[Intro]
(Come on)
You got friends, Quik got friends
So let’s get down again (Come on)
You got friends, AMG got friends
So let’s get down again (Come on)
You got friends, G-One got friends
So let’s get down again (Come on)
You got friends, Saadiq got friends
So let’s get down again

[Verse 1: Raphael Saadiq]
If that's your man
I'm not impressed
You did your best
But you failed the test
It's him you'll kiss
But me you'll miss
So here's a tip
You'll never feel no lips like this

[Chorus]
Boys and girls will all be watching
When I step in the room
I'll be coming round the corner
To get one last peek-a-boo
Oh-ooh-ooooh
Oh-ooh-ooooh

[Verse 2]
You made your choice
You made it quick
This time next year
You might need my…
Here goes my card
So call me soon
I know you will
'Cause we just kissed in the back room

[Chorus 2X]
Boys and girls will all be watching
When I step in the room
I'll be coming round the corner
To get one last peek-a-boo
Oh-ooh-ooooh
Oh-ooh-ooooh

[Bridge 2X]
Girl, I want to be your everything
Just like a fantasy
Girl, I'm not gonna be no memory
I got to be your only fantasy

[Rap: AMG]
Now here you are in the car with a superstar
Baby knows who I are, I was at the bar
Monte Cristo cigar dipped in caviar
Triple-T and AMG and I’m up to par
Soul Food is the name that you need to know
Blow up like the Summer Jam show and hoes
Never booze but I sip DP and OJ
Raphael paid a nigga to say, hey
Boys and girls

[Chorus 5X]
Boys and girls will all be watching
When I step in the room
I'll be coming ‘round the corner
To get one last peek-a-boo
Oh-ooh-ooooh
Oh-ooh-ooooh
