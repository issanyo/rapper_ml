[Verse 1: Dj Quik]
When the dick's good, hoes want it down to the nuts
You don't need no Viagra or ExtenZe
'Cause when the dick's good
They put their cushion on your front
And they swing it from left to right until it ends
But then they all catch feelings and the psycho shows
And that's when they become them passive aggressive hoes
Talkin' bout flippin' it with what she do with her toys
You can't put nothin' in me, bitch! I'm a boy!
And if you keep annoyin' me
I'ma pump yo' pussy full of lead and poison both your ovaries
I'm fly, too fly
I wish it made sense to say Three fly
But can't because we high
Sterile from the barrel, so that means that I'm clean
And I'm so cool I can nut ice cream
Now, how you want it? When you want it?
Come get up on it
If you get it, you gon' get it
You know how I get when I hit it, I split it

Huh? Talking to me?

[Verse 2]
Niggas in L.A. they talk just like a bitch
Mouth open like ho pussy complete with the drips
You lucky my security don't want it to pop
They looking out for you bastards
If it was me, you'd be shot
Real men don't gossip and real G's don't plot
They put it down where they started
And once it start, it don't stop
If you had as much money as you niggas had words
You'd probably be up on it 'stead of down on the curb
I'm a legend and a playa and a gangsta to boot
The only banger with the key to the city in my loot
I've had a spell placed over me that'll screw up your luck
If you put your mouth up on me, probably you'll be fucked
That's the voodoo that Pirus do, that fly crews do
That fire on tired niggas who block cock like you do
Killa and a prophet, Nostradamus with Glocks
Acquitted at the trial, only my hair is in locks
Now kick rocks

[Verse 3: Dj Quik]
You wanna know me? You wanna know my mind?
I like to make dope beats and hear dope ass lines
I like to drink from this cup and have a dope ass time
I like multiple bottles, empty, but all in a line
I'm a star, you can only be a co-star here
That should be cool considerin' that you wasn't shit last year
Super Cocky Disc Jockey used to fight like Hockey
Apollo Creed on Rocky
I'll make you bleed if you mock me
Checkin' niggas on Twitter who wanna brand me as bitter
Watch your mouth and bite your lip or get it split by a spitter
Now do every drug you wanna 'cause it's all from the earth
Make them lines, do some lines, just remember your worth
