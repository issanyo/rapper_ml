[Intro: DJ Quik]
Yeah
Ain’t nothin’ but DJ Quik, my boy KK
Doing a little dedication to the neighborhood that raised us—the Hub City
KK reintroduce yourself

[Verse 1: KK]
You don’t know me, bitch; just wish you could
I’m KK with the cat from the Compton backwoods
With a city full of stars, wannabes
Young G’s, rats, euro Cutlasses, ‘Lacs
Dippin’, swervin’, niggas still servin’ yay
Through the valley of death, best keep your wheels turnin’
Look and learn, tweed burn by the minute
Trickin’ the private throats, can’t if my hustle ain’t it
Man, get wit’ it
I shouldn’t be reasoning the rules
It’s harder by the second tryin’ not to use the proper tools
But fools get sent to school with all that tryna clown
That junk poppin’ too much could get’cha tossed around
And broke down by necessary parts
Brains, balls, dick, and muthafuckin’ heart from the start
You niggas underestimatin’ skills?
Sittin’ back talkin’ ‘bout “Y’all niggas ain’t real”
While all you hookers lose your will, we chillin’ in the zone spaces
Business ain’t concernin’ you, so stay up out our face
The chase on, hold it tight when on the mic
You ain’t actin’ right, off with your lights

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
This is so Compton—it’s so Aranbe and Spruce
It’s so Kemp Street, it’s so Rosecrans
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so 105 Freeway, east to west in the evening
Too muthafuckin’ Compton

[Verse 2: KK]
You know we blowin’ tweed
Ain’t no need to mention drinkin’ fluid
You caught up on your water, well now you’re going through it
That’s a blast—I’m a not the type to do it, turn in your player pass
Ya blew it—take that there, chew it with your slow movement
I’m paced, KK style but true to it
220, but now you know the time gon’ blow it
Search yourself first, girl, then go for it
Calm down, way down before you throw it
Hold on, disinfect your mouth ‘fore you choke it
Now ain’t no jokin’, before I start pokin’
You gotta stop that tweakin’, tryna kiss me and loc
Yeah, bitch, back on the scene
Cut black clean, blessed, unstressed, and still lookin’ 19
While haters I went to school with, they to the curb
Like exes, when I see ‘em, they be frownin’ with no words
I don’t deserve, rumors unheard, never Hollywood
Guys, my bodyguard is why I’m solo through your hoods
Now to the blunts, it all ain’t good
You the type to bleeze stuck up in your fantasy, bitch

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
This is so Compton—it’s so Gonzalez Park
Muthafuckin’ Compton—it’s so Lueders Park
So muthafuckin’ Compton
So Jim’s Burgers, so Dees Liquor

[Verse 3: KK]
Hey, I’m live, I’m givin’, I’m livin’ it
See or it or be it as you may, you know you can’t fuck wit’ it
That keep it real wit’ it—man, I’m standing here, the truth
And being KK without something to prove
Everybody got something to lose
When the button get pushed and it’s you, it’s getting battered and bruised
Then there’s nothing left to do, except for you
Sitting at home, phonin’ the black and blue
Now why glorify a killer or thug, gangsta banger
Then run and hide, terrified, fearing the danger
I’m remaining the same
Bald head, black, part of the original West Coast rap gang from Compton
Pacific C, California—one of three West states that producin’ that stankonia
I’m putting that 2nd II None on ya—now move, muthafucka, ‘cause I’m…

[Chorus: DJ Quik]
This is so Compton—it’s so Aranbe and Spruce
It’s so Kemp Street, it’s so Rosecrans
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so 105 Freeway, in the morning or the evening
It’s too muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Jim’s Burgers, so Dees Liquor, so neighborhood
This is so Compton
It’s so Centennial, it’s so Compton High, it’s all to the good
So muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Black Tone, it’s so Big Ducky, it’s so Quik’s hood
Too muthafuckin’ Compton
It’s so Tree Will, so Big Chubbs, every last hood
So muthafuckin’ Compton
The Hub City, C-O-M-P-T-O-N
It’s too muthafuckin’ Compton
