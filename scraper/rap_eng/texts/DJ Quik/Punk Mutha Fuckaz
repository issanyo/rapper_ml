[Intro: Gangsta D]
Yeah, this is dedicated to the homies
To the niggas that didn’t get a chance to see this album
That’s laying six feet deep…still rollin’ on a creep
Looking up in the sky, you know what I’m sayin’

[Verse 1: Gangsta D]
Another nigga dead—but man, from what?
Because he went out his way to see a bitch ass slut
He didn’t know that she was the neighborhood hoe
I guess the bitch got a kick for settin’ up the dulo
The brotha that got killed was very close to me
Me and K and many others went to school with G
He rolled a Glasshouse, plushed out on laces
I remember back, we used to roll many places
‘Til one night, he went to roll and get his dick wet
I still remember ‘cause I forget
The next day, on my way to the schoolhouse, runnin’ late
I seen my nigga standin’ out, crying at the gate
I said, “What’s wrong?” ‘cause my nigga didn’t look right
(“Man, Albert Woods got killed last night”)
I felt hurt, wanna do dirt for my nigga, yet, my brother
‘Cause he got killed by a punk muthafucka

[Interlude: Gangsta D + (KK)]
I see muthafuckas don’t wanna go head up no more
Niggas wanna use gats (Punk ass bitch ass muthafucka)
I wish we could go back to the old school when niggas go head up
Really I do, really I do, really I do…check this out…

[Verse 2: KK]
Can’t forget about a true nigga, the only player, the bitch hog
I’m calling on Ronnie Baylor a.k.a. Dog
Now he went out on the dot of a cluck
Who was just paid up by the fool who couldn’t run up
Shouts in the hood said he switched to the other side
True homies know where his heart lied
It’s a fact of his family, not a P. Stone or a Crip
He had to move to check hisself a grip
But now back in his hood, a little fool got jacked
Blamed it on Baylor but didn’t wanna hold the gat
So for his dirty work, he straight played a cluck head
(POW POW) To the brain and Baylor wound up dead
And for the niggas that’s supposed to be true homies, yo
Couldn’t make it to the funeral
BULLSHIT—you thought he switched, that was junk
True homies never turn except punk muthafuckas

[Interlude: KK + Gangsta D]
Yeah, y’all know what I’m talking about, all y’all punk muthafuckas
Down and out on your homies, you know
Fuck all y’all
If you ain’t true from the beginning, stay the fuck out the game
Rest in peace, all homies…
