[Verse Two: Richie Rich]
A cat like me, love to stack, man
Though my thoughts be to page a black girl
Hands on boots if it's after 2
Fall thru, watch what I do to you
Miss the rest, known as the Rich
Heavy in the game but swift, hold a bitch
Time to take the party to another lev'
Tonight boss ball with some real celebs
We drink old XO, safe sex so
The VIP need it all for a G
Spin my chips on somethin devine
Like *?Heer 2's?* and *?fuse?*, but what in the news
We all pimpin, fall apart, no starts
E'rybody pimpin but mackin is an art
Like Picasso, my philoso-phy
Be's the mo' hoes, mo' cheese

[Hook]

[Bridge: Rick James]
You keep on runnin, baby
Why you runnin, baby?
Stop your runnin, yeah
You keep on runnin, baby
Why you runnin, baby?
Don't be so hard to get
Girl, don't be hard to get
Girl, don't be hard to get

[Verse Three: Richie Rich]
Poppin my collar, met her at the bar
Shootin her ship, tryin to put her in the car
No bites but, shit, a nigga got bait
I push to win it, most niggas ride 8's
V-Dub's, Mary Jane like my cousin
Keep that bitch close by for the high
The real niggas often do real things
Like floss on tracks with Quik and Rick James

[Hook/Outro: Rick James and (Richie Rich)]
