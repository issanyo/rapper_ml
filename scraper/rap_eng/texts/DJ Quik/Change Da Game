(DJ Quik - Talking)
Wow, for real though
We need something just a little bit different
Ya know, it's a whole lot goin on right now
But y'all can calm down though, y'all can
Cause we 'bout to change the game
Can you feel that?
If you really wanna change the game let me hear ya say 'ohh yeah'
Haha, I just had to do that once

Ay, C-P-T style
Jumpin up outta the Burb'
Parked more than 18 inches from the curb
While I'm smellin them stanky stenches from the herb
Red-eyed flight, and I'm lookin for my red-eyed homie
Black Tone, cause I said I might
Just have to pass through, and let 'em hear some shit that's pretty fat
From Spade Ty to King Tee, this is where it's at nigga
Makin million dollar deals at a checker table
And my nephews gone be the youngest niggas with a record label
I'm the only nigga that promised to show up
With more talent than any nigga and I didn't wanna blow up
I shine like glitter cause I'm natural
If on the first night I hit, then that's a ho
And I gotta stay away
You can never by mine your nigga he got you on layaway, bitch
We 'bout to change the game

(Hook - DJ Quik & James DeBarge)

(DJ Quik)
Can I get a Rum and Coke?
Cause the keef smoke made a nigga hum and choke
Blazed and dazed
Now put me on the stage and I'll change the game in major ways
Gettin wild like a buckin horse
With enough momentum to change the whole muthafuckin course
All I need nigga, is a crew and a point
And I'll make a statement only on a brew and a joint
No joke, cause growin up dirty, hungry and broke
Don't mean I gotta be dirty, hungry and broke
Dude I made a way out a no way, and y'all can too
Cause it's a whole lotta legal shit that y'all can do
And fuck the media, keep on steppin, yeah I said it
Where your pass at? Who you know here? Where you headed?
Only show us when we doin bad
When we in the mud I brake that muthafuckin camera
Now fuck them niggas
We 'bout to change the game

Shepherd Lane, Euponic
Dog, we the realest
Hit the game wit a twist, now they label us the illest
More advanced than that wack nigga punchin a Lex
After Balance & Options, I'mma show ya who's next
Ain't no room in the court for cowards who can't ride
Ate up the dick, left the balls on the side
'Bout to take a trip to Neptune, everybody wanna roll
If you ain't loyal to the camp, nigga hell no
We about to change the game in many ways
Dollar signs, attitudes, dog in a real way
Condos to sky scrapers with my name on the desk
Big C-E-O, rider from the Black Tek
If it wasn't for Dave, lookin out
Your nigga Johnny, be on the corner lookin burnt out
That's what it pays to appreciate thangs
Put a nigga in position to change the whole game
