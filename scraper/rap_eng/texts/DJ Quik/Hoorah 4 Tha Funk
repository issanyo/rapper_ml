[DJ Quik]
Hell motherfucking yeah
Now we about to get about this motherfucker
But we want y'all to know one thang:
You got'z to keep the "P" in it
Cause Funk without the "P" just ain't funky enough for me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Peace to all my niggas
That's down with that P-Funk
And we about this motherfucker
But before we go
Yo Garry, kick some more of that crazy shit
