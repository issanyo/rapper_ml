Yo Quik... hey homie, I got a story to tell you
You know I'm a to-myself type nigga, but uh
I gotta share this one with you homie
I was fuckin' around with this shit called mushroom one day
And the shit had me goin' crazy dogg
Got me losin' my motherfuckin' mind

I'm like Dre, mushrooms got my mind
I ain't knowin' what to expect cause this is my first time
I've been bumpin' Eminem, yo it ain't "My Fault"
And I'm trippin' like your bitch while doin' the hood walk
In the studio, lights out, candles burnin'
Two incense but all I saw was the blunt burnin'
Step outside, to get some fresh air
And I'm trippin' like a motherfucker, red roaches everywhere
My brain heavy like a mack truck
I'm bout to die nigga, take me to the hospital, pedal punch
Mashin' Wilmington, headed for emergency
Goin' so fast I got attacked by anxiety
I don't know why, but my high's comin' down
But by this time we in the parkin' lot now
I don't know what to do, go in or stay out
But I'm contemplatin' on blowin' my motherfuckin' brains out

Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')

We better go in just to be on the safe side
How many shrooms I done ate? Oh, about five
Where the nurse at? I need some oxygen
Runnin' out of breath off a fuckin' hallucenegen
Passed the doctor, ran to the one-time
Tellin' him my problems and what I did to get high
Situation gettin' switchy
My nigga White's in the bathroom hidin' the sticky
Cause the Berg's tweaking, drama jumpin' off
Cops in to smoke her, but damn they didn't have to choke her
Blood's on the ground and it's tweakin' me out, screamin' like Carrie
Ran up out the E-Uni' to try to find a local shroomy
I hit the 105 tryin' to find the homie Jim
But damn dogg I couldn't find him
My mouth gettin' dry as a motherfucker, I need a Snapple
Cause it feel like the desert by my adams apple

[Hook] (DJ Quik on talkbox)
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')

Now I ain't fuckin' with that shit no more, it got me losin' my mind
Wantin' to fight, talk, kill and drink-n-drive
On top of that, this nigga brought me out some OJ
Back on the freeway and a nigga still thirsty
They told me not to fuck with Vitamin C
Cause it'll bring your high back up, fuck it I need some fluid in me
We on our way to Saccs house
Twenty minutes later Donald Duck got me bout to take myself out
I finally arrived at the homeboy's spot
Fluorescent lights got a nigga brain 'bout to pop
Saccs, a nigga got a hold to a bad batch
Took a whole eighth, and don't really think I'm comin' back
Could you tell me how long this fuckin' high lasts?
Cause I feel like a smoker who done took a blast
I need to lay down, turn the lights out
That's what I get for fuckin' with some shit that I don't know about

[Hook] (DJ Quik on talkbox)
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really tweakin')
Mushrooms got my mind...
(And I'm really tweakin', I'm really really tweakin')
(We gets loaded, when ya know it, but it's time to jump down)
