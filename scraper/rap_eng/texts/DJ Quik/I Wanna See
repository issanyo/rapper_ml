[*scratched* “Do you wanna see?”]

[Intro: DJ Quik + Hi-C]
Yes, trademark on that ass
And it’s the H-I-dash
Yeah, Mister DJ Quik
Check this out—ay nigga, what you got on my CD, nigga?
You better quit listening to your woman’s and go buy your own, fool
Check this out

[Verse 1]
[DJ Quik]
It’s like a 1, 2, 3, 3, to 2, 1
Hi-C and DJ Quik have just begun
Cruisin’ the W slash just for fun
And when my homies come with the straps, you best run
Trippin’, now you’re fuckin’ with a massive team
Mister Hi-C fills your throat with cream
So put on your vest, punk, let’s put it to rest
Let this booger rat see how we can nut on her chest

[Hi-C]
Yeah, yo Quik, I hit a bitch that was fine as fuck
I really wanna see if she was giving it up
I got at homegirl like, “What’s up with that ass?”
Two days later, she let me smash
I start rippin’ it out, got to dickin’ it out
I remember her face but couldn’t figure it out
Later on we stroll to my mama crib
Come to find out that bitch was my relative

[DJ Quik]
Now see, that’s the kinda shit that you’re up against
Fuckin’ with them bitches that ain’t got good sense
Now I don’t mean to diss your distant blood, but then
The hooker shoulda known she was your next of kin
Now of them type of bitches, see, I likes to get rid
Because getting set up by a bitch is my biggest fear
So meet me on my couch and I’ll give you the real
That all I got for you, baby, is a dick and a heave

[Hi-C]
Yeah, you gotta fuck ‘em, feed ‘em, and forget about ‘em
And if my girl ask, I don’t know shit about ‘em
You don’t want me, you just want my wealth
How the fuck you love me and you don’t love yourself?
I don’t know carazy, don’t know karate
But I’ll put a bullet hole inside your Versace
Watch me, I’m not the one to trust
Come and suck up on these nuts like a slut

[Chorus]
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right

[Verse 2]
[DJ Quik]
Now I’m, puffin’ on a Newport, lookin’ for a new sport
Slam dunkin’ in your pussy, I got the home court
Advantage, you can’t manage to insert the damage
So wrap your pussy in a bandage
Come on, bitch, you better tell me somethin’
Before I pour this Boone’s Farm in your belly button
And uh, I can’t fuck you if your pussy’s stinky
But if it’s clean, uh oh, look out (There’s Mister Winky!)
Making love is like ecstasy

[Hi-C]
Especially when you serve with the H-I-C
Don’t mess with me, I’ma do you right
When I hit that thigh, it’s like exercise
Now 1 and 2, come on, work it out now
3 and 4, put this in your mouth
Niggas can’t fuck with the style, you don’t hear me
Have your mama and your daddy screaming, “Oh, really!”

[DJ Quik]
Now pussy ain’t nothin’ but meat on a bone
You fuck it and you suck and you leave it alone
Now tell me how many bitches think that you can fade me
When my dick is getting sampled more than a breakbeat
I’m a horny type of fellow; I’ll fuck you, brown or yellow
Move your cellulite ass, make it shake like Jell-O
‘Cause some of you bitches need to exercise
With the stretchmark train tracks running down your thighs

[Hi-C]
Falling back on that ass with no hesitation
Shit feels good like ejaculation
Bet they can’t wait for the penetration
But if she talk shit, I get to masturbatin’
I give it to ya high, I give it to ya low
Some niggas fuck fast while (I go slow)
Hi-C and DJ Quik, ya playa hatin’ muthafuckas can’t fuck with this

[Chorus]
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right

[Hi-C]
I had two bomb bitches jumpin’ in my bed
One fell down and start giving me head
I called my nigga and the homie said
“Don’t fuck with them bitches, you’ll end up dead”
When it comes to sex I keep it clean
When it comes to pussy, I’m a fiend
Ain’t giving up shit but ding-a-ling
And if the bitch get hungry, hit Burger King

[DJ Quik]
I heard you sip dick like a coffee cup
So dribble on my gobble and make it stand up
But in 19-90…if you’s a stranger
Lick up on this rubber ‘cause I don’t like danger
And when I fuck you in my back seat
I’m running laps around your pussy like a track meet
‘Cause I’m the DJ Q-U-I-K and I wanna bone ya
Crawf, ask this bitch (Do you wanna…?)

[Chorus]
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right
(“Do you wanna see?) I wanna see what you got for me
(“Do you wanna see?) I heard you do it so right

(“I’m gonna do it”) Hi-C’s in the house
(So right, so right, so right, so right)
(So right, so right, so right, so right)
(So right, so right, so right, so right)
(Sho you right…yeah, sho you right)
(So right…)
