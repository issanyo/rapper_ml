How many times I had to tell you baby
I ain't got nothin' to prove to you, no no
Doin' the things you know is going to drive me crazy
Thinkin' I don't need the shit you're going through

When I come home at night, I try to lay my head down
You do the things that keep me awake
It's like you love to hear me argue for survive(?), girl
How much am I supposed to take?

If you feel like I feel you wouldn't act this way, girl
Is this the price I have to pay?

Ah, baby, but

[Hook: repeat 2X]
All I want to do is
Make sure that nothing's wrong with my kids
So we can get along and still be friends

[James Debarge]
I stuck around 'coz I thought things were going to get better
I should have had more trust in me, uh uh oh oh
I know you tricked around when we went through our thing
Steady stealing time with him but you were coming home to me

You didn't care what I thought you had to have your way girl
You had your cake and ate it too
I still try to look out although you did me wrong
Getting even just ain't cool

If you feel like I feel you wouldn't act this way, girl
Ain't nothing left for me to say

But to tell you that

You know I can't live without my children, yeah
