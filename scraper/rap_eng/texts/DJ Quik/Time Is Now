[Intro]
Yes, yes, yes, yes! We have our A-selection, featuring our brother Murs, featuring, featuring Miss Latoiya Williams, featuring, featuring, featuring big Snoop Dogg, produced by Niggarachi. Niggarachi! Entitled the "Time Is Now"!

[Hook: Latoiya Williams]
Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now!

[Verse 1: Murs]
Look, not now, but right now, it's time to change the game
A new style, something different, you know, uplifting
New sound from the West that we all can get with it
The Pacific to be specific
Ain't another rapper on the whole coast this gifted
Missed the magic, aristocratic, yeah, automatic, yeah
Systematic, look, my grey anatomy bust through they academy
Crushed the main frame, it changed the game radically
Move with such agilely, crews to try to battle me
Totally tear washing their teeths, another tragedy
Never has the game seen such savagery
The audacity, all of these rappers mad at me
Rising so rapidly, I defy gravity
Next up is Dogg, I thank y'all for having me!

[Hook: Latoiya Williams]
Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now!

[Verse 2:  Snoop Dogg]
(Ride, ride!)
Yeah, yeah, we like to float and ride
Smoke when they lock, the homie got the rope and they glide
They see us like smoke when they rot
Huntin' rappers and they hoping they hot
Gang bangers, yeah, they local in they block
Low riders, yeah, stroke and they high
College brains, yeah, they smoke on they pot
'Till it's old gang cold, and it's meant to be sold
Stay tuned 'till the next episode, when we ride and roll
If he fake, he foe, if he real let the story be told
In a land where you will be exposed
OGs, hood rats, and the punk po-pos
Hard to grab fo' toes, and dip low lows
Ride slow with the top pulled back
Pulling on some of that, sippin'  on some 'yac
Stars with the Mars, splurges with Murs
Blank out and make out
Stay way up, cause it's about to go down, for real

[Hook: Latoiya Williams]
Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now!

[Verse 3: Murs]
I heard Jim Brown got the OGs talking peace
Life without beef on these LA streets
Something I thought was beyond belief
Sunday, ain't nobody tripping at the beach
Nine deuce troops and what happened to the movement
And you drive-by shooting, nigga, what is y'all doing?
We gotta get up and change the dial
The time is here, the time is now, yeah

[Hook: Latoiya Williams]
Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now!

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
You're listening to the beautiful sounds of Latoiya Williams, and my main man Murs, featuring Snoop D-O double G, it's going down, produced by Niggarachi

[Outro: Latoiya Williams]
Time is now, it's going down, in my town, time is now
Cause it's going down! (In my town, right now!)
Right now! (Now!) Right now (Now!) Right now (Now!)
