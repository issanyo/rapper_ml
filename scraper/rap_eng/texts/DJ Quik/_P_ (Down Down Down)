(Verse 1)
Used to shout at bitches, now I come up like a P
Tryna get these hoes, like my nigga Eazy-E
One more time for you trick ass hoes
I ain't lickin' pussy n I ain't suckin' toes
Pass me your debit I can give you whatchu' need
I love to fuck bitches, but I'm also filled wit greed
Hand me a fat check
And I'll give you good dick
Bust another nut down your neck
Suck it real slow then I'll blow, Den I go
Try to call my name but I dipped out the door
I know you don't like it but I played you fasho
Got another bitch tryna fuck me for snow
But I never sell to that type of bitch
Can't trust a whore or you may end up in a ditch
But P never get's played, he only gets richer
Fuckin' wit a thick bitvh who gets his dick bigger

(Multiple Exhales)

(Chorus)
Pussy pussy P
I'm a player motherfucka
Didn't choose the P
The pussy chose me
Lyin' ass hoes gettin' fucked all Summer
While yo punk ass livin' life like a bummer
Now hit me up girl if ya feelin real gushi
Cuz I can stab dick straight up in yo coochi

(Multiple Exhales)

(Verse 2)
Now what's up girl
You ever heard about me?
I'm that nigga K-N-O double-N
Ass fat shawty you can say dat you a ten
A P like me will never fold, never bend
Now I like a fine bitch who can suck a good dick
Ten minutes later you'll have me leakin' out my stick
Now don't go takin' it outchea nouth gettin' pregnant
Cuz I don't mind leavin' yo ass in a second

(Multiple Exhales)

(Chorus)
Pussy pussy P
I'm a player motherfucka
Didn't choose the P
The pussy chose me
Lyin' ass hoes gettin' fucked all Summer
While yo punk ass livin' life like a bummer
Now hit me up girl if ya feelin real gushi
Cuz I can stab dick straight up in yo coochi
