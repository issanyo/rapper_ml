Paroles de la chanson Do I Love Her- Dirty Version/club Mix :
(DJ Quik)
Lay there, please don't move baby
On me, don't you stop
Doggy, comin through baby
Watch me hit the spot
You make me wanna speak Spanish
You make me wanna be manish
Nothing could compare to the way we keep it hot
Strawberries soakin in amaretto out in the limo
Be spitty, got the car lookin pretty, in the window
Lets hit the indo
Commit a sin in this crescendo
Smoky, foggy
Take off your coat, lets hit the doggy
Pull out your scrunchie, let me play through your mane
Long, brown, nice and round, explorin my brain
Selective and picky when we get wet and get sticky
In and out, without a clue, not even a hickey
Love it or leave it, addictive like crystal to meth
And it's hard to let go of me when I shift to the left
Never like what you're happy for, I'm more than a man
I can even make you feel me when you're usin your hand
I'm confident, like an MVP
Got the key to the CPT
Lookin for a G like me
She F-E-M-A-L-E
Where you be at?
True love only can be that
I'm tellin you that you the shit
Call me when you get this hit

(Refrain 1: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her? (Suga Free: nuh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no, no)
And should I treat her (no, no) like no other? (nah)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

(Refrain 1: Suga Free)
Do I love her? (uh huh)
Do I need her? (Oh, yeah)
And when she tells me she loves me, I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
No I don't love her, (mmm hmm)
And I don't need her (Yeah, yeah)
And if she don't give me me money I'm a leave her

(verse 2)
See baby, I got a spot to fill
And all that callin me out my name gonna have you
Runnin down the street barefooted again sayin "not for real!"
And how you gonna blame mine?
Dawon and Suga Free the same person
But you will never catch me and him in the same room at the same time
Baby, you not yo best, I called you
Cuz I was broke, hoeless, and short on these little ends
And it wasn't for no sex
I see you still messin wit yo phony ballers
But when they tired of you
You run yo lil ass right back over here beggin me for 20 dollars
And mighty funny (mighty funny)
You get nice than a mug with them hugs, actin like you in love
With a nigga, when you love money
What? you stuck?
Hoe, if I tell yo flea to pull a tree
You get a chain and hook his lil ass up
Quik'll give you a piece of his planet
But I'll give you a dirt rock
Half a low quat
Not a dope spot
Nor a piece of this pomegranet
Baby wanna eat-eat?
Cuz Suga Free-Free
Will go gleek-gleek
And tweak-tweak
And put yo all to sleep-sleep
Ooh, I'm a tell (I'm a tell)
Suga Free pop a beat and spit a rap so swell
She said, "suga free, you know anything about cars, honey?"
I said, yeah, you fill em up with hoes
Take em to the hoes store
So they can get that money!

(Refrain 2: DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (suga free: uh uh)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (no way)
And do I treat her (no) like no other (man)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother suga free

(Refrain 2: Suga Free)
Aah, do I love her do I need her? (DJ Quik: Oh, yeah)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yea you do)
Do I love her? (mmm hmm) Do I need her? (fo sho)
Leave me 'lone, leave me 'lone, Devil be gone! I'm leaving (yeah)

(DJ Quik, talking)
See, that's what y'all get for underestimatin me and Suga Free
We told y'all we was magical, way back in 1996
But y'all didn't feel that. Y'all chose to sleep on us
Baby, we so powerful, we can make the rain stop (Rain, ne me nome)
You feel that?

(Refrain 3: DJ Quik)
Do I love her, do I need her?
Do I take my money out and feed her?
And do I treat her (mmm mmm) like no other? (naw)
I don't know, I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

(Refrain 3: Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, Do I need her? (DJ Quik: mmm hmm)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (yeah, you do)
Now do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her (you should)
You ne me nome, ne me nome, fore I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (ne me nome!)
And do I treat her a-like no other? (yaah!)
I don't know I think I need to ask my brother Suga Free

(Suga Free)
Ooh, do I love her, do I need her? (sure do)
And when she tell me she love me I don't believe her (she need you too)
And do I love her (mmm hmm) or care about her? (you outta)
You ne me nome, leave me alone, before I lock you in that box again

(DJ Quik)
Do I love her do I need her? (Box again)
Do I take my money out and feed her? (Box again!)
And do I treat her a-like no other?

(Suga Free)
Ne me nome
