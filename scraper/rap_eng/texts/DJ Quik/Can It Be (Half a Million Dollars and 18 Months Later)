[Michael Jackson] "could it be I stayed away to long"

[Murs]
For my supporters and fans, man I know ya'll been waiting
Now its finally here and thank you for your patience
The worlds gone crazy since the last time we spoke
Blood shed in war, the absence of hope
Shooting at the school, the economy is a joke
Homies on heroine, homies on coke
But can you even blame them when they're only trying to cope, damn!

All these rappers want to talk about is guns and dope
Don't they realize we all at the end of our rope
The future all depends on the power of our quotes
The power of our pen, the power of our vote
The power of your words, the power of your voice
The power of America is the freedom of choice
We choose to do nothing, we losing, we're suffering

Can it be that its time to do something
It’s not socialism, it’s not communism
It’s loving each other, realize there’s no difference
Its positive movement, gradual improvement
When no one else does, believe you can do it
My heart is a speaker, I bleed this music
The beats in my blood, I must transfuse it
If it wasn't for this, then I just might lose it, damn!

My goddaughters, Nadia, Symon
Diana know your fathers' never coming home
Claimed by the streets its another war zone
Tears in my eyes as I'm writing this song
Mommy working two jobs trying to do it on her own
No matter where I go or how far I roam
Know that I love you, you'll never be alone
Damn, you're so grown

From the independent hip hop scene
Now they talking like how I'm not a hip hop fiend
Needle in my arm, can't they see that I'm OD'N?
You'll never take the stripes of this triple OG'N
I blaze trails, created festival
Lost 50Gs on Paid Dues, is that acceptable?
What?
I'm not down for the cause?
Hold on mic, I'mma need a few bars

I could've done a Nas and scream hip hop is dead
I got up off my ass and I did something instead
Signed with the devil spent my scene in the upper level
Killed the beast from within now I'm a born again rebel
Trying to save the youth from the way of the gun
And if I only save one then my job is done
So you can say what you will, but you should judge me none!

From my God, from my faith; I move place to place
Sometimes I thought if I should die, that be great
Drop on the spot man I didn't even care
I stopped talking to you, I stopped saying prayers
Numb from the liquor and the anti-depressants
Pressure from the label, studio stressin'
Almost lost my passion to pursue this profession

For myself for my soul when I'm out on the road
I give so much out to these kids I don't know
I thought I lost you with no one to talk to
But you're the one that opened up the doors that I walked through
I can't fault you only forgive you
I'm the only one that seen the pain that you been though
The drama the struggle that built all your issues
Its all just to make sure they never forget you

[Micheal Jackson] "Did I leave your mind when I was gone
Its not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at."
