[Warren G]
Oh yeah, I chill with Nate like I did as a youth
It's still 213, ain't nothin different with Snoop
Music is the tool I used to leave the hood with
Became my own man, I wish you would BITCH
I been around the world and back
Two times, ain't nuthin like home, it's crackin
After all the women, the money and the TV shows
I'm not really tryin' to see these hoes

[DJ Quik]
Now AMG said her eyes are the index to her soul
But when I look at her face, all I see is her hole
We sex playin with the Hennessy, and she in the mood
While y'all see her as a broad, dude, I see her as food
Take her back up to the bar to get her cigarette lit
I told her, "I be buyin' liquor like it ain't shh..."
She told me I'm a player motherfuu..
Forget about it, she know the scam
And now she belly dancin' to that Indian Jam
So hell, I'mma let her get a little more buzzed
'Til she starts to get to slurrin' and forget where she was
Take her purse out to her buddy car and back to the bar
For another round of drinks with a pla-ti-num star
I'm getting conceited a little bit, the game owe me
I've been humble since my first hit, but back to baby
I'mma rub her on her belly, make her scoot down the couch
Look her right up in her eyes, and take some food out her mouth
She want it

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
There she goes
The kind of girl that I wanted always
My favorite pro
Feminine but she got gangsta ways
I thought you should know
The way I want it, I get it that way
Can't stand it no more
Nobody does it better than she

[Nate Dogg]
When I wake up in the morning
Fresh up outta my dream
I ain't even finish yawning
Still as hard as I can be
Even tho I haven't found her
I seen her when I was asleep
I'm pretty sure that she is out there
I'm pretty sure that there is someone else for me

[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Hey ho, hey ho, now that I found you
I won't look any further (further)
Hey ho, hey ho, now that I found you
I won't look any further (further)

[Chorus]
There she goes
The kind of girl that I wanted always
My favorite pro
Feminine but she got gangsta ways
I thought you should know
The way I want it, I get it that way
Can't stand it no more
Nobody does it better than she

[Nate Dogg]
The first time I ever saw her
I couldn't look her in her face
I tried hard to ignore her
But I couldn't walk away
When I finally got the courage
I couldn't think of what to say
To make a long story shorter
I better bust a different way
I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She was kinda cavi to me
Had some nigga hanging on, I sent that busta home
And now she ridin' with me
THERE SHE GOES!!!

[Chorus 2X]
There she goes
The kind of girl that I wanted always
My favorite pro
Feminine but she got gangsta ways
I thought you should know
The way I want it, I get it that way
Can't stand it no more
Nobody does it better than she
