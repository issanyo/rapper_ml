[Guy 1]-Ay, ay, ay, Topsaw; ay, Topsaw
[Guy 2]-Ay man, what is it, man?
[G1]-Who on the record, man?
[G2]-Man, who the hell are you, man? Walkin' up on me lookin' like you so broke, man, if it cost three cents to shit you'd have to throw up. You know who on the record. Man, why don't you sit your ignorant ass down, man, and listen...

[Verse 1: Playa Hamm & (DJ Quik)]
So is it my turn again? (Yeah nigga it's yours)
Oh, I can kick a funky verse for the P-Funk? (Of course)
Well, countdown nigga to the end for these fakers
Bet we hit this time and we fadin' all takers
Who'da thunk the funk was this potent out the Westside
Not be along for the ride (But it's only for the trues)
That's right, so peep the shot
And if I get it hot, baby I'ma rock the twat
'Cause ain't no party like a party in the Penthouse suite
And you know how we do it, baby, yo Tree
So if the mackin-est mack brings fear to them perpetrators frontin', they was cowards from the very start
Pretendin' theys the ones that trues
But pimp, who was they foolin'? (Not me or you)
Fools confused, thinking we's on a decline
'Cause we keeps the P's. Ain't it true, Dr. Funkenstein?

[Chorus]
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

[Verse 2: 2-Tone]
Comin' at that ass again it don't stop
Bust a lean in yo' 6-4 Chev, take a hop to the top
Where the hustlas hang out
Indo remains to sprout and sell knows what I'm talking about
And gets hoes from my block to your neighborhood
Tell 'em, Quik, when you know he's back to no good
I wish you would, 'cause I'm true to this gangsta shit
I took a Tic Tac, and tossed 'em like a hoe in the hood bitch
Shoot my ends, hoe
They say it's never enough, you know?
I gots to have mo'
But I'ma shake the spot, in fact
I just jacked his trick and his fo' so I can cut the 'Lac
And straight P-Funk anytime
It's only right you peeped the rhyme, I gots to take mine
Check yo' ass with the shit that stank
'Cause 2-Tone came to the game, ain't a damn thang changed

[Chorus]
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

[Verse 3: Kam]
Well, it's the 1 to the 9 with the 9 to the 4
And I thought you knew the drill, but you still don't hear me though
KAM and Watts Up from the grass roots
No daisy duke shit, knockin' crazy ass boots
Nigga please, we kick it like G's
Puttin' down work, when I lurk, don't even sneeze (up the gold D's)
That's just the Eastside way of getting chips
When you're raised up dealin' with the dogs and the 'rips
New cars get tagged, lowriders get wrecked
Niggas caps get peeled back, and chins get checked
Don't expect no love or no apology
The kids ain't fallin' for your child psychology
In 9 and 4 mindin' yo' business is the best bet
Screamin 'Watts riot' and we ain't even made a mess yet
You shouldn't speak with a weak heart
You gots to finish everything you start
And ain't a damn thang changed

[Chorus]
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

[Verse 4: Hi-C]
Now niggas transform like decepticons
We'll slice your ass up like Jeffrey Dahm...
Quik drop bombs on the P-Funk tip
Even though a nigga rap you'll still get that ass whipped
Please don't slip, ain't a damn than changed
Numb yo' ass up like some novocaine
Have you all fucked up like you smoked some loop
Hi-C still sippin' pussy like soup
We got Kam, Hamm, Nookie, and Quik
And me myself, mister big dick
Now I might not know which bitch that I want
But I know on thing I *scratch* [Got to have the funk]
From ya speaker and not from ya ass
'Cause some of y'all bitches just won't take baths
Half-head niggas cannot be tamed
'Cause we true to the game
And ain't a damn thang changed

[Chorus]
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk
*scratches* Nothing has changed
Nothing has *scratches* got to have the funk

[Verse 5: Gangsta D (2nd II None)]
Can ya tell me? (Who that nigga be?)
Goddamn, muthafucka, it's the Gangsta D
Kickin' shit for these niggas and all these bad necks
'Cause I got the dope shit for each and every set
Next..

[Verse 6: KK (2nd II None)]
Up on line it's that BlaKKazz K
I could never switch up ya 'cause I'm still the same way
Me and D can flip the shit, kick down a funky flow
We represent the (P-Funk)
You know what it stand for

[Verse 7: DJ Quik]
Now back up in yo' ass again, it's Mister Quik and I clowns
I got the shit that shake 'em down, break 'em down, take 'em down
And now that I'm
Chillin' with my niggas Mister 2-Tone, 2nd II None, Playa Hamm and Kam
Well goddamn
Doin' it like we do it, ain't nuttin' but trues to it
Rollin' with the funky 'P' I thought you knew it
'Cause it's nothin' but the best
For the trues from the West...Side
'Cause ain't nuttin' changed and you know that's right

[General Jeff]
Yeah, this is General Jeff
Bringin' up the rear
Lettin' ya know we representin' with an all-star line up for that ass
Peep this out
We got Quik, 2nd II None, Hi-C, Playa Hamm, 2-Tone and that nigga Kam
If that don't move your ass I don't know what will
But no matter what, you gots to keep the P in it
That's mandatory, baby, 'cause ain't nuttin' changed
