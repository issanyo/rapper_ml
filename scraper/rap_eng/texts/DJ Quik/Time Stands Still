[Intro/Hook: Dwele]
All I Want Is For My Time With You To Slow Down
Don't Really Make It In Town Like I Used To
So For Now, All I Want Is Time With You To Slow Down
Don't Really Make It In Town Like I Used To, For Now

[DJ Quik:]
I Appreciate Your Patience
What Am I Doing Without You
Never Hear No Bad Shit Out Here In These Streets About You
Love Must Just Missed It's Mark
Jealousy Is The Counterpart
Life Has Made Us Drift Apart
No More Willing To Embark
But We Remained Friends Throughout
All Those Years From Then To Now
Both Those Feelings Trust And Doubt
Argue Till You Storm Out
Other Dude Gave You A Kid
He Didn't Have You Like I Did
I Pieced You Out
Then Ya'll Broke Up
You Called Me Again
Drunk And Crying On The Phone
Next Flight Out You Gone Be Home
Flight Delayed I Still Wait
Call Me When You Reach The Gate
Pick You Up At Baggage Claim
Tunnel Vision Just Begun Cause You And Your Son
Look Like You And My Son

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
All I Need Is More Time Is Having You Right Beside With Your Mine
Only A Couple Minutes More, Slow Down
Somebody Slip Father Time A Pillow
Know That If I Could I Would Pay Full Time On Some Matrix Shit, Slow Down
Dodging Every Minute Like A Bullet
Somebody Slip Father Time A Pillow, A Pillow

[DJ Quik:]
Let Me Get Your Bags Out Of The Truck
Get The Keys And Go Upstairs
Cover Tattoo's On Your Arm
That Just Memory Souvenir's
We Got Plans Tonight
We Going To The Cheese Cake Factory
Drink A Little And Reminisce About How You Used To Laugh At Me
Didn't Think I Would Go To Far
With Me Being From Compton, And All
But Still I Grab Some Corks Some Yarn And Rubbers And Made Myself A Ball
I Know Your Momma Proud Of Me
Cause She Looked Down On Me
She Knew I Had It
She Said That I Would Make It
If I Just Stayed At It
Now How's Your Neice
The One Who Used To Stay With You When You Lived On Over By The Street
She Looked Like My Nephew Kiana
She Used To Do Her Hair Like Rihanna
You Remember Me What

[Quik Talking:]
[Girl:] Kisses Him
[DJ Quik:] Why You Kiss Me When I'm Talking, Just Had To Bring Back All Them Old Memories, Huh
So You Ready To Go? You Sure You Don't Wanna Another Drink?
Ok Let Me Get The Check

[Hook:]
All I Need Is More Time Having You Right Beside With Your Mine
And Only For A Couple Minutes More, Slow Down
Somebody Slip Father Time A Pillow
Know That If I Couldn't Pay Full Time On Some Major Shit, Slow Down
Dodging Every Minute Like A Bullet
Somebody Slip Father Time A Pillow, A Pillow

[Outro/Hook]
