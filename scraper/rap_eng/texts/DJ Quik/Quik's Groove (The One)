[Verse 1: The Game]
You see I wake up in the morning
Grab my blunt and pull my dick up out this bitch mouth
I'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast
Making a nigga wanna smack that ass
See, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said, "If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive."
Cause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't
I'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam
They had the bomb,
And if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga
I push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron
Make a nigga disappear like J-Kwon
Body found by the Swans
Nigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing
I'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if he do or don't die
He ain't never coming back
Now it's one, two, buckle my shoe
Patent leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do
It's the P-I-R-to-the-U
And I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo
Yay yay, I said I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo

[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]
I hope you giving head today
Cause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Baby we gon' celebrate, celebration
You bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one
One you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one
I only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one
But you know I'm always open to suggestions
I said let me be the one
Down for you, it should never be a question, babe
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Yeah, Quik is the name
With The Game, it's a goddamn shame
Niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames
Ignite it up, haters knotted up
When you trip with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy
Then its back to shawty, all the ladies drink free
All the players grab a tab, that's how that's supposed to be
Drinking Casamigos, fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now
She so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fire's the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first hit

[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]
I hope you giving head today
Cause I just wanna put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Baby we gon' celebrate, celebration
You bring all your girls and I'ma bring my crew, let me be the one
One you take home at the end of the night babe,  let me be the one
I only want you to myself babe,  let me be the one
But you know I'm always open to suggestions
I said let me be the one
Down for you, it should never be a question, babe
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind

[Verse 3: The Game]
Now DJ Quik got a bitch from the Bay
Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick like a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch "Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering," I got a bitch from the Nickersons
That got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh

[Verse 4: DJ Quik]
I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass?
No shit

[Hook: Micah & Sevyn Streeter]
I hope you giving head today

Down for you, it should never be a question, babe
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
To blow your mind, away, away, my time
Don't waste my time, baby, don't waste my time
To blow your mind, to blow your mind

[Outro: DJ EZ Dicc (Ricky Harris)]
She's sucking on my dick
She's a bad, bad girl
Uh, h-hold on, hold on, baby
Your head hit the button, girl
We on the li-
Z-boy fro, yo man are we live?
We still live, huh?
Damn girl, don't stop though
Hit you off with something brand new
A Travis Barker produced joint, believe it or not
Hold on, let me hit this button
