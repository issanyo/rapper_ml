Ahehah, guess who motherfuckers?
[I don't give a fuck, my attitude is Gotti] Yeah
[And I'm hard to love, cause I don't love nobody] Hell nah
[All I give a fuck about is music and sex]
[A fifth of Remi Martin and some big fat checks]

Yeahhhhh! Hahahah
Back up in this motherfucker for the n-fin
And this one is dedicated, to the Westside of the Tree
Four hundred block, you know what I'm sayin?
And this is STILL Eiht Killa
And fuck all his old scary ass homeboys too
Yeah
Nineteen ninety-one
Just when all these other rappers seem to be fallin by the wayside
We put a team together and came out with some of that ol fonky shit
But during the course of then and now
Some of my homeboys went Hollywood, now I ain't gon say no names
But they know who the fuck I'm talkin to
And it's all to the good, cause this is STILL P-Funk on mine, huh

*singing* Street level, street level, street level
Quik is funkin that street level

Now you can play like you don't know what the fuck I'm talkin about
But you know what's happenin, nigga

*singing* Street level, street level, street level
Quik is funkin that street level

Hell yeah
Uhh
Now it's nineteen ninety-five
But we've been on the scene for a minute, you know what I'm sayin
And I come to realize one motherfuckin thing
And it's some real shit (yes it is)
That fonk without with the P, just ain't fonky enough for me
See you gots to keep tha P in it, cause that's the only way
They gon really understand it
You know what the fuck I'm sayin?
Hell yeah, heheh

*singing* Street level, street level, street level
Quik is funkin that street level

Cause fo'hundred block is in this motherfucker
Fo'ever, bitch!
So fuck all you old mark ass niggas
Hmm
