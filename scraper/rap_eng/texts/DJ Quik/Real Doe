[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Yeah, now I'm checking a grip and them suckas is boo-hoo'n
'Cause slanging them funky ass tracks is what I'm doin'
(Yo, DJ Quik, what time is it?)
It's time to show the homies I can make another hit
Another bomb ass cut and another 10 dollar tape
In the pen, they gettin' swoll and on the outs, they steady rollin' on my shit
'Cause they know that Quik will never quit
I’m not an N.W.A, I ain’t yet, I’m on my way
To the top of the tree, for C.M.W. to see
(Yeah!) It's me
Chillin' with the D, KK, AMG
And another homie dog known to you as Hi-C
And we be kicking it, Genuine Draft in my clutch
I'm getting funky with your ho because she's soft to the touch
And then I'm out, fading all them niggas with no hope
Who just got a taste of the real doe

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: D]
So you say you want doe, here's a mothafucking hit
(Yeah, boy, I like that shit)
Now back to my goodie old good note
I'm getting sweated 'cause I roll with the good doe
You wanna get a little taste?
Bitch, 10 dollars for a mothafucking tape
And if you try to snatch my stash
I'm gonna beat your Black monkey ass
Give me the pipe, 'cause that ain't right
Look at you, nigga, you been up all night
You say you want a true high?
You say you wanna get fucked up
Here's a proper blast
(Now go on with your funky ass)
And tell the rest of your folks
That the D and the fellas got the bomb ass doe

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: KK]
Take a taste of the real
The D-O-P-E doe, now the deal
You know some niggas can't cope with the K
I'm shaking the dice and leaving them broke
It was your last hope, so what you do is croak
You smelled the smoke, you choke, 'cause I'm unfadeable
It was the note I wrote that made it playable
So take a quote, now write it, because I stay able
Yeah, the K is goddamn able to rock a mic
Straight out, you know I'm destined, who want to light
The pipe, I got the Russian, I know I'm right
(We know) I couldn't trust them
With the pureness of the doe because it's not chest-bustin'
I'm the K, straight from 2nd II None
And if you wanna get some
Take a chance, come with a cut rope
You know you can't hang with a hit from the real doe

[Interlude]

[Verse 4: AMG]
You know it's funky, funky, funky, I love a fat monkey
I rap for the niggas, and steal from the honkies
And hoes want the autograph, but I start to laugh
'Cause you used to ignore me, but now you adore me
'Cause bitch, you's a mothafucking trick
Only out for the AMG's dick
Girl, I got paid, now I got it made
Put your money where your mouth is, fuck, take a suck
'Cause I know (I know), I know (I know)
You's a big freak, so open sesame
And let me pop the pill, show you how I feel
Nut in your butt and all that stuff
'Cause the vertical joyride's taking off
I got my ticket, ho, so show me where to go
And play me like a good old guitar
Let me be your rock star with the real doe

[Interlude]
