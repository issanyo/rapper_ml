92.3 tha beat

Kickin' it at the top of my treehouse
Gettin' blazed off N-deuce point tres
And I gotta say
Bout damn time we got a station in the neighborhood
That ain't scared to play what's all to the good
Theo keep it poppin'
Afternoon drive in your ride while that ass on that deuce keep droppin'
Right on beat, but it ain't KISSnet
It's 92.3 and Theo is the shiznit
And Compton's in the house once more
You're listenin' to that n*gga Quiksta and your homeboy Theo
Tryin' stack paper like players and gents
Cuz if it don't make dollaz, it don't make sense
I gotta make that money to the left of the decimal point
While I'm blazing up the rest of my joint
With this fat neck givin' up the fanny
She let me hump her, then I dumped her
Now she's calling Lisa Canning
Left the motel listening to the Love Affair with Jammin' James
Like Luther say: Keep it right there
Playin' oldies while I'm scrapin' the walls
There's only one station that's fadin' them all
And they let us call in...

92.3 tha beat
