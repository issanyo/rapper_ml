[Intro]
It's early in the evening
8:37 PM
Yeah
Smelling good in here
Pacific Standard Time
Look at this y'all look
Drankin'
This what's happening

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
No. 2 is for pencils, so I'ma do instrumentals
I write in my head, I still see too much potential
I’m throwin’ them parties, the ones you remember
In 1999, from June to November
I’m walkin’ round in my sandals, but I’m getting shit handled
With or without the scandal; yeah, I’m getting shit handled
Im too old? No such
Too funky, pretty much
That's whats up, nigga
Partying in L.A., niggas showin’ me love
They brought me 12 drinks and I threw up in the club
Are y'all gon' kill me? Am I gon' kill myself?
I go too fucking hard, I need to watch my health
See, I need to brush my teeth and shit
Lay off this leaf and shit
Before I get a DUI
See you high — Yeah, I'm high
Finicky people wanna hold me as hostage
I do about face and walk right into my conscience
Gold around my neck, ain’t nothing on my toes
A bunch of white powder, ain't nothing up my nose
I’m a geek I suppose
I’m a freak I suppose
I’m whatever you want me to be this week I suppose
Yeah, it’s getting, it’s getting, It’s getting kind of hectic
It's getting kind turnt and all these hoes getting naked
I'm toasting my bread, yeah, a toast to my bread, yeah
A toast to my homies, now let’s go eat and get fed, yeah
I’m feeling kinda loaded; yeah, I'm feeling some buzz
Yup, I'm filling my red cup, we 'bout to go bottoms up
Nigga don’t understand me, he’s a goddamn liar (Why?)
'Cause if he don’t comprehend me, he’s probably too damn high
Do you understand Porsche?
Do you understand Mercedes?
Do you understand buses and parties with fine ladies?
You still don’t, playa? Then I guess it’s good
I'm like that German writing you see under my hoods
Not in my hood, but up under my hoods
Be as stupid as you want to like they taught you you should
Niggas is 18 percent of population in school
50 percent suspensions, explusions — that shit ain’t cool, partna
School is free, life after that is not
Asphalt pavement is cold, tension in jail is hot
Muthafuckas In my neighborhood grew up to be nothing
I went around the world stuntin’, they still there doing nothing
And now its Three's Company on my planet
I'm kicking Chrissy out and keeping Janet
Thats a brunette, Moet — Who’s next?
Go check
Hey homie, if you don't mind, go open the door for those bitches

[Interlude]
Huuuu
You killing it
You doing it just like i showed you
Remember if these people don't like you
That means they see you as competition
They adversarial
Just keep the secrets and let them keep on talking

[David Blake III]
Standing on the top peak, I climb to get some leverage
Opposition in my cup, tossing down the beverage
Put me in the boat, the bottom filled with holes
In the middle of the O, I still make it to the Coast
Cause we gonna party hard, and we ain’t in no rush
Got me trapped in this balloon, waiting for it to bust
See, this life that I'm in, workin’ for what I want
All these trendy things that everybody always be on
But see I'm only on me, that's why I stand out
Always things that's in my way but love they way they pan out
Man, this life is so crazy, nose is smelling them checks
I'm just making music 'til i know what I'ma do next
The labels know who I am, y'all ain't gotta be worried
You could read that we winning, nigga, and that's a true story
Man, I came so far, I just never acknowledged it
I throw you my creations, I just love your astonishment

I'ma be me to the death of me
And I'ma keep 100 to the death of me
I love to love, did I mention that?
But sometimes these niggas tend to make the tension bad
I keep it honest, don’t be mad at me
But I don’t really like to talk 'cause I don’t like to speak
And when I say that I keep you aroused
I'm that A-1 getter, know I put it down
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter, yeah
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter, whoa
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter, yeah
'Cause I’m that getter, I’m that getter, I’m that getter
