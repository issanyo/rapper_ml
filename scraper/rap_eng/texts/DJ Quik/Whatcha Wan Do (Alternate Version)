[Intro: Problem]
Let’s get it hot
Problem, Kurupt, Quik
Swag meter up, let’s fly

[Verse 1: Problem]
Huh, all I do is fuck a bitch
She ain’t wit’ it? Then it’s ‘fuck the bitch’
Get the next yamp, hit the next yamp
Pull it out and bust right on her tramp stamp
Ha, that’s that tat that’s above her ass
It’s her nigga name, let me cover that
Squirt—after that, ain’t no coming back
Man, you know I hit them holes like a running back
Problem, nigga, I stay in that Gucci shit, Louis shit
I get drunk, might get your coochie licked
Ha, I’ma keep it way clean though
With my tongue, I get ‘em wetter than Nemo
Cancerous flow, a nigga need chemo
Fly like an eagle with big ass Debo
Make that thang sang like Peabo
Bryson, while I’m biting on your ear like I’m Tyson

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke, biatch (What you really wanna do?)

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
What’s this supposed to be? Who you supposed to break?
Who you supposed to be? What you supposed to take?
You think I give a shit? Man, you’re wrong
It don’t matter if you got a bra on, thong on only
See, I do it by my lonely
Make your best friend wanna bone me
All up on me, wanna bone me, all on me
STOP—think about why
Is it the dick, the grip, the expenditure of chips?
My clique, me and DJ Quik, bitch, what it is?
Tell the truth and shame the muthafuckin’ devil, hoe
Or get hit until you got sense, ‘cause you ain’t got shit
I got a lotta somethin’ for ya though (what?) dick
Now pass it to your friend—now what you wanna do?

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke, biatch (What you really wanna do?)

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Throw your hands in the hair
And let me split your little middle part right up to the hairs
Me and your pussy was made for each other
Up above the covers in our sheepskin rubbers
I got two friends, girl, and they my nuts (just two)
And all my ex-girlfriends hate my guts (that’s you)
They out the pond but they still my ducks
And even though we don’t fuck, they still fucked up
Because they know I hit the pussy like an easy pitch
I take a church girl and make her a sleazy bitch
I put out my own records so I’m easy rich
And I’m reppin’ like I’m Ruthless so I’m Eazy Quik
Now let’s fuck one time for Mister Eric Wright
Let’s fuck two times for Mausberg (tight)
Let’s fuck three times, ‘cause three-pack rubbers cost $3.29
And I know you drink wine, so fine

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke, biatch (What you really wanna do?)

(What you really wanna do?)
