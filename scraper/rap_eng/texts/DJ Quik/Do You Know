[Kurupt]
Yeah, I know
Yeah I know
You know I know, you know I know
You know I know, you know I know
Know I know

[Chorus: DJ Quik & Desiree Anderson]
Now if your beats ain't poppin and the streets don't jock'em
And it ain't nuttin' poppin', it ain't poppin'
And if the walls ain't shakin' and your pockets ain't breakin'
Then it ain't no fakin', you ain't makin'
It's like yeah, and you don't stop
You can make it all the way to the top, but first come on down!
(Back to life) But first you gotta come on down
(Back to life) Yeah

[Kurupt]
Yeah you know what's up, I know you like that
Bring it right back, I know you like that
That's the feeling, don't try to fight back
It'll bite back, cause I know you like that
My trunk got bump and my beat got shine
I lead D.P.G. in the city of sunshine
Birds of a feather in the air they get together
It's just how we do, together now forever forever true
All the things that I done in my lifetime
Two 9's by my waistline, lifeline
You need a Jag to have swag
I just walk in and the swag is the Jag
I got an apartment in the stash compartment
Just in case you wanna start shit, listen
Lil' mama lookin' for a G
Yeah she lookin' for a nigga like me (like me)

[Chorus: DJ Quik & Desiree Anderson]
Now if your beats ain't poppin and the streets don't jock'em
And it ain't nuttin' poppin', it ain't poppin'
And if the walls ain't shakin' and your pockets ain't breakin'
Then it ain't no fakin', you ain't makin'
It's like yeah, and you don't stop
You can make it all the way to the top, but first come on down!
(Back to life) But first you gotta come on down
(Back to life) Yeah

[DJ Quik]
Now where they go, with the fellatio?
Say it so, lay it low, player pro, stay or go
You want hay or 'dro? Bombay or Mo'? Grey or no?
Way to go; I see she's happy that's the way to go
So I'ma just jump in the Jag and dash
Get some gravel behind me, pickin' up my cash
And if you see me simply speakin' begone
Because tonight we got a function goin' on
So break out your Gucci, Louis and Prada, Chanel
Then after the club, relocate to the hotel
After the hotel we migrate up to the lab
To make a beat with Saadiq, and eat some lobster and crab
Drink some Goose and then stab, the kidneys and bladder
Nationality matters
I like them out-of-towners who come from the Copa Cabana
This beat is bananas
It hits your antennas, cause DJ Quik's more gifted than Santa

[Chorus: DJ Quik & Desiree Anderson]
Now if your beats ain't poppin and the streets don't jock'em
And it ain't nuttin' poppin', it ain't poppin'
And if the walls ain't shakin' and your pockets ain't breakin'
Then it ain't no fakin', you ain't makin'
It's like yeah, and you don't stop
You can make it all the way to the top, but first come on down!
(Back to life) But first you gotta come on down
(Back to life) Yeah
