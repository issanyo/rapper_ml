[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm heavy hearted, heavy handed, misunderstanded
Turn a permanent repercussion, I empty the cannon
I'm addicted to ganja, roll it up in the wood
Drink a gallon of Henny, throw it up for the hood
I'mma ride for my people, give my people a voice
Never followed a leader, use my weapon of choice
This is not an illusion, this is not a mirage
Conversation with God, spilling my soul out
I own assault weapons that fold out like Megatron
The iron long, drop bottom bombs on Babylon
So tag along like a dog with a vagabond
Smoke 'till the cess is gone
Niggas on their grind, put my motherfucking records on
So they can relate to the hate and the pain
To the struggle and strain
Never take it in vain, breathing one and the same
Pressure push your forehead out the back of your brain
So west

[Verse 2: YG]
'Bout to bring the coast back, 'bout to bring the coast back
Told them make it nasty like some motherfucking cognac
Pull up on your niggas like Jordan at the three line
Still in the hood, hanging like beehives
Your money like knee-high, my money like ye-high
I whip the Porsche like it's a horse, maybe say yee-ha
We striped like Adidas, and be bang like speakers
'Bout to cop a couple of houses and have more spots than cheetas
You sell with the coke, I sell with the flow
You off-brand rappers wouldn't sell/sail with a boat
You be tweeting a lot, you be talking too much
But when daytime pass, you still wouldn't bust
We can pinky-promise, but I still wouldn't trust
They talk down on me, but I still look up
Just was talking to Nip, he say he still fucked up
It's the westside, niggas get chipped like woodchuck

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
What I represent, the whole coast line
All on my back, fool, I'mma hold mine
I do it everyday, I do this every time
I got my motherfucking nine every, every time
I told you why I came, see this is all about
The way we push the east coast all the way to the south
You see us in the north, hey man, we going off
Seventeen shots, hit 'em, look, throw the Molotov
Blowing up the building, I raise, everybody feel it
Everywhere a rage, you can feel me coming through
Everyday dropping down, throw everything I got
When I fly high as the sky
Walking on the clouds, say it loud
I'm so hood, nigga, too bad to be good
Looking at 'em like I wish they would
I burn 'em all every time, any place and they know they could
Step to the side any place, stepping up in Inglewood
I got the homies, on lock

[Verse 4: E-40]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never have, never will
They'll never be another E 4-0
I told you once before
I ain't rapping too fast, y'all just listening too slow
You may not see me on the TV channel
But in the hood I'm still hot like the left-sink handle
Mobster like Marlon Brando or should I say Tony Soprano?
I hit you with the heel of my .40 caliber handle
Platinum and gold plaques
I was doing the damn thing while y'all was drinking Similac
Macking on mine, that's what I told your batch
She think I'm a .jpeg, she wanna get attached
Turn up like the vegetable
Speaking of vegetables, right now I'm on this medical
I got this heinous style I'm feeling mane, I'm throwed
I'm a boss, put the president on hold

[Verse 5: DJ Quik]
I got big plans to make, big dough to get
I got big tracks to rhyme on, this supposed to hit
Got big bottles to buy, big bushes to saw
Now how the hell y'all hate me and I'm just like y'all?
I need a watch that's shiny
To make the spine be the same color as the piping on the seats behind me
Diamonds in the ring, and the watch is apparent
I ain't gotta prove I'm fly; parrot
I’m Phillip Drummond producing the Mrs. Garret
If the shoe fits, ten and a half, I can wear it
I spit it like I meant it, you resent it? Splendid
I spit the four bars before this verse had ended
Whatever the trend is, I pen, this is not freestyle
I’d like to see my pistol like Lennon did
A big kid, and an even bigger adult
I'm slow flowed, I should be pushing Renault
And I'm solo, yo

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
If I said I'd be doing this at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be just the innocent Kendrick you've seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in a seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer, a doctor
Instead of a boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
And do 'em all if they gossip
Children on the corn, stay vandalizing the option
Of living a lie, driving their bodies with toxics
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim it, then bang it, then slide
Out the bitch the deposit
The prize on his head that tithes probably'll go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the critics
And Snoop passed us the torch, I'mma burn you rappers with it
What's up?

[Verse 7: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, it's back on me
I guess I'll take the microphone casually
And do my thug-izzle straight from the dome
And let you niggas know that's watching at home
BET, easily, let me show you how it go
S-N double O, break down a smooth flow
Breaking like dominoes
Lay it on the table for you
Let you a little game for your mind
Get a lawyer, this is too much for you
You couldn't understand
Let me drop another plan holding my left hand
Moving my right hand, dropping the next game
Quik doing his damn thing, I'm spitting mo' flame
Preme there on the turntables cutting up shit like
Snoopy D-O double G, making you get right
Never, ever hit like, we do this like
West coast motherfucker, bust in your face like
What?
