If I could get a dollar, for everytime you look at me sideways
I'll pay the Westside on Friday's to build y'all playa haters y'all own highways
Don't trip on me partner, no uh-uh
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary with AIDS tryin' to give me some nana
You can't dictate mines, what I look like to you baby?
Besides the feelin' is fine
All natural like oat bran, engineered like no other
Fly for life, still as a mannequin when it comes to my mother
Capricorn baby and I'm stubborn just like you
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool
Don't get me twisted baby, I love you too
But when that rent and that car note come what love gon' do?
Baby, my money's on the clock, right around the block
You see me stack big knot, my music's all I got
So I'mma stay ready so I don't gotta get ready
Cause I rose like King Tut and resurrect it like Amadeus

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Don't ask nobody, ask me baby)
You ain't got to get ready
(Same thing go around gon' come right back around)
If you stay ready
(Fa sho, can ya feel me?)
You ain't got to get ready
(Cause I can feel you)

[Playa Hamm]
Now, orange juice and Austy got me feelin' lodi dodi
Flippin' through my phone book tryin' to find me a hottie
I can't wait to let ya lies and just relax with
That ain't jockin' me cause of who I stacks with
Ain't too many I'm comin' across qualifyin'
But I be that player from the P that's just gon' keep on tryin'
I go from A to Y, cause I don't know no Z's
To the Brougham, blow the brains and enjoy the breeze
These hunnies got me wonderin' if I'll ever find one
That'll get me to that place where I wouldn't mind one
Out in traffic I see many lookin' choosable
It never fails though, I always end up usin' those
For whatever I'm needin' at that point in time
A get-away, a good one or another rhyme
I'm tired of the S.O.S. but it's real
Long as I feel 'em like I do I guess I'm just gon' deal

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Same thing make you laugh will make you cry)
You ain't got to get ready
(We ain't worried about nothin', we fly for life)
If you stay ready... (What?)
You ain't got to get ready

[Suga Free]
Hey Playa Hamm, I know they sayin' oh boy that's come classic connection
Playa for real, ya - ya feel me? (Oh yeah-yeah)
Now this the - kingpin, Westside, best side, let's ride
And God bless my backbones, my homeboys like Black Tone

[Playa Hamm]
Bringin' it through for the true everytime I speak
Sprinkles the rest like '40, but they still comin' weaker
I'mma keep it simple so the tricks can comprehend
You can never be me, only see me with a end

[Suga Free]
Well if they ain't ripe yet, they can stay on the tree
Cause I'm your friendly neighborhood playa partner Suga Free
Liable to haul off and spit these P's that'll break you to your knees
She'll lie, steal and kill for real for me, Hamm please

[Playa Hamm]
Now what they thought baby? We ain't comin' to raw
If she broke she gon' get a job, or break the law
They say God blessed the child, God is on it so true
We ain't get it like we got it dependin' on you

[Suga Free]
Now I can show ya better than I can tell ya, so swell
No, put your clothes back on baby
I'm into breakin' hearts, promises and fingernails
There was no I's... And I put that on the Holy Ghost and four more God's
You broke my heart and I let you succeed
Cause to a playa that's a organ that you really don't need
Low and behold, what good is havin' a heart if it can break and be re-broke?
So if you stay ready what you gon' have to get ready for?

[Hook]
If you stay ready
(Kingpin for life y'all)
You ain't got to get ready
(Kingpin... ah ah)
If you stay ready
(I pin the tail on the funky enough)
You ain't got to get ready
(And shocks her with this funky stuff)
If you stay ready
(Why you bullshittin'?)
You ain't got to get ready
(What's happenin'?)
If you stay ready
(Kingpin for life)
You ain't got to get ready
(Kingpin for life, y'all)

You know... straight game...
Never... game... DJ Quik... what's up baby?
Playa Hamm... G-One... Robert Bacon... yeah
