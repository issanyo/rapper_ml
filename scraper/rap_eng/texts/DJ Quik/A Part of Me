Yea yea Yea yea yea, Yea yea yea yea yea
We live and we die life is full of surprises
And I can't get over the fact that your gone
I try to realize your not part of my life
But I still try to fight but it just don’t seem right

Cause your not here anymore
I can still see you walking out the door
Your just a memory of what used to be

Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me

I didn’t think you do it. You'd really leave me
If I did it would be different believe me
Its easy to say baby I’ma change
The very next day it was the back to the same
Going though my phone finding new names
I said it was business, I was so lame
You saw though it and held me down
A real queen, you held that crown
You made such an impression on my life
Natural progression was you to be my wife
We talked family, we talked kids
You thought I’d clam down. I never did
I bought you home things from the rode before
Malaysia, Australia, silk form Singapore
But what I give you this time you can't get rid of
So you left me tired of this sick love

Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me

Sitting here listing to the record you bought me
Kinda blue, original copy
You changed my life put me on to so much
I miss our talks more then your touch
Such a fool to lose such a good thing
You showed me parts of my city that I never seen
Parts of myself that I never knew existed
Then I got famous; I got it twisted!
You needed me! I didn't need you
Find you a man that can do what I do for you!
I flew you to Rome I paid for this home
How you coming at me like you grown?!
Forget what I did on tour
I said I loved you. You needed more
Why you tripping? You need to understand
Sometimes a man's gotta be a man

Sitting with my head between my hands
I know ill never get you back again
I never meant to hurt you never meant to make you cry
Why am I surprised?
I am who I am because of you
I’m sorry for the pain I put you though
Maybe its all just a dream
But your still a part of me

Walk in the house late, drunk, stumbling
I pass out you would come tuck me in
Where you at? Baby I need you
I never knew all the pain this would lead to
I’m sorry I lied, tried to deceive you
You said you'd leave but I didn’t believe you
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry
I’m so sorry, I’m sorry, girl
I’m sorry I’m sorry, I’m sorry
Baby I’m sorry
