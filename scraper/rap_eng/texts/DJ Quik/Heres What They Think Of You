[Nate Dogg (DJ Quik)]

This is what they think of you (here's what they think about you) think about you (this is what they think about you) think about you (here's what they think about you) this is what they think of you

[DJ Quik]

They say you suckas ain't got no hustle, no drive, if its west than you came to settle no jive, yo b, yo god, yo son, yall ain't real, yo money, ya'll cats be frontin', what the deal, its a conspiracy made by the rest no doubt, its like the game is designed to keep the left coast out, so how about instead of doing 106th and park we do 108th and crenshaw after dark

[Nate Dogg]

Seen a nigga smile so i turned and asked, why your mouth got so much plaque, thinking you the shit all young and sporty, can't wait to see your grill when you turn 40, im a sex symbol and you can't pronunciate, but 2pac passed so they sing it anyway, stretching pintos yah, you flossing poorly, you need to pump yo brakes, yeah slow down whodi

[Chorus]
This is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you

[DJ Quik]

Yeah they say ya'll smoke cigar shake, that's the craze, cut open a blunt lick it back and blaze, over hurr, over thurr, that's the catch phrase, skip the bathwater, ya'll be dirty for days, brown weed, gold teeth, hit the floor now, robitussin all in your cup got you slowed now, let the streets tell it nigga word of mouth, 'cause ain't nobody catching no colds down south

[Nate Dogg]

Where u from nigga yup had to beef, acting all mad, mad dogging me, yeah i know you got the bombest weed and palm trees but you should of cut that f**kin' curl in eighty three, when girls come around you don't even flirt, busy throwing up rags f**kin' up my concert, why we be busy making paper chasing cheese, you still set trippin' off them b's and c's

[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]

There ain't shit you won't do for a record deal, why we be making moves, you be keeping it real, why we comparing bank rolls, you comparing skills, one more thing man back wood skill, you wanna be famous nigga, sound like us, gotta copy the west to go platinum plus, when i come through the east and hang homie i swang, i leave my radio 'cause ya'll don't play us out there

[DJ Quik]

What the hell ya'll hating for, can't a young player make money anymore, without having to be from the south or east shore, this the gangland bangin' is paying a g more, nate dogg he done busted your girls bubble, compton and long beach together now you know you in trouble, taking death chances bangin' to show that we true but still

[Outro]

This is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you, think about you, think about you, this is what they think of you
