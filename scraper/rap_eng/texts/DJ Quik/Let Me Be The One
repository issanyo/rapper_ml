[Verse 1: Game]
You see I woke up in the morning, grab my blunt
And put my dick up out this bitch mouth (da, da, da)
I’m feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast, making a niggas wanna smack that ass
See I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said “If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive”
Cause I ain’t for the tricking, no I ain’t, I’m with my main bitch
And my side bitch, I’m feeling like Saddam, they have the bomb
And if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga, I’ll push that nigga Hairline back like he LeBron
Make a nigga body disappear like J-Kwon, body found my the swamps, missing both of his arms
I ain’t playing, I’m with the rat-a-tat-tat, shoot a nigga, if he do or don’t die, he never coming back
Now it’s one, two, buckle my shoe, padded leather Guiseppe’s, nigga watch what the fuck I do
This the P-I-R to the U and I put that on my momma, I’mma ride for you baby boo
Yeah, yeah, I said I put that on my momma, I’mma ride for you baby boo

[Hook]
I hope you’re giving head today
I just want to put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Feel me we gon’ celebrate (celebrations)
You bring all your girls and I’mma bring my crew
(Let me be the one) you  take home at the end of the night babe
(Let me be the one) Only want you to myself babe
(Let me be the one) You know I’m open to suggestions
(Let me be the one) Down for you, should never be a question baby
(Look in my eyes) Help my mind, oh
Help my mind

[Verse 2: Dj Quik]
Yeah, Quik is the name, with the Game it’s a goddamn shame
Niggas can’t see that we to blame for putting compton in flames
Ignite it up, haters get knotted up when you trill
Put canker sores in your whip, that’s what I do
To protect my party, my goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy
Then we start the show, all the ladies drink free
All the players grad a tab, that’s how that’s supposed to be
Drinking [?] fucking faster than grand national regals
I’m in it with the pussy doing kegels (what?)
I’m so Fred Segal right now, she’s so spread eagle right now
Ain’t nothing but the clothes going down
I’m in the game and the fire’s the same
The music is imminent like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16 bar verses
And I’m still coming off like this my first real hit

[Hook]
I hope you’re giving head today
I just want to put this dick all in you (So I can bust a nut)
Feel me we gon’ celebrate (celebrations)
You bring all your girls and I’mma bring my crew
(Let me be the one) you  take home at the end of the night babe
(Let me be the one) Only want you to myself babe
(Let me be the one) You know I’m open to suggestions
(Let me be the one) Down for you, should never be a question baby
(Look in my eyes) Help my mind, oh
Help my mind

[Verse 3: Game (DJ Quik)]
But DJ Quik got a bitch from the bay
Said she wanna fuck his little homie got her sipping on that Alizay
You ever had that fix up to Mausberg before
And had a Mausberg leaning on the front though?
Treat my dick like a newborn, hold the head
I told her, “bitch, pimpin’ ain’t dead, hoes are scared”
So stop that bickering, I got a bitch from the Nickersons
They got a fuckin’ bounty on my head
(I’m running with Chuck Taylors too
He doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady go and work those hips like an inmate work those dips
Baby work those lips, if it don’t make dollars don’t holler
(It’s DJ Quik, in any year Impala
And if it don’t make sense, it don’t flinch
What do you get from a bull that don’t chew grass
No shit)
