[Intro Dialogue: Bugsy & Dominique]
Tell me, what do you think of Mister Quik?
What do you mean?
You know, would you like, think he's someone you might wanna fuck?
Yes

[Verse 1]
It's like ooh-ahh, how you like me now?
Mista Quik up in yo' ass like a dog of puppy chow
'Cause I'm diggy-diggin' the guts out
Then I'm takin' my nuts out
Rinsin' 'em off then I'm up and out
So you tend to think I'm 5'11 but I'm six feet tall
With enough dick to have you climbin' up the wall
One nuts, two nuts, three and four
Then I wake up in the morning and I bust two more
'Cause that's the freak in me, and yes, I'm very doggy
Playin' with your coochie 'til it's nice and soggy
Saddle up the horsey then I ride it West to the North, East and South
And then I put it in your mouth
And shoot a missile. right up where you whistle
Kiss it, lick it
Hoochie mama, you know where to stick it
'Cause if I couldn't fuck, you wouldn't be in my bed
Bitin' on my pillows and bumpin' yo' head
Because, I got the dick you want to know better (that's right)
I've got the nuts that swang together
So here's a promise from me to you
If you ever want to get the bone up and do the grown up
Then we can handle this, baby, just don't get loud
'Cause I'ma cover up your mouth, bitch, while I'm Diggin' U Out

[Chorus]
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky* (Yes!)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Slangin' this dick like dope* (While I'm Diggin' U Out)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that money 'til it's funky* (Yes!)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Yo D, Hi-C, all up in that shit*

[Verse 2]
Now I'm wearin' more caps that the fuckin' Mad Hatter
Makin' hoes melt, whether thin or fatter
And if you don't believe me, then it really don't matter
'Cause I'm diggin' it, pullin' it, yankin' it, bringin' the damage to your bladder
And I'm knowin', you knew the job was dangerous when you took it
You played your pussy like bait and let me hook it
So remove your dentures and bob
'Cause it's not just a job, it's an adventure
Dook chute, brown or vanilla, mellow yellow
Color don't matter 'cause I'm not a choosy fellow
As long as I got me a hat
Girl, I can introduce my dog to your cat
'Cause fuckin' is the way of life, my favorite pastime
And I gets happy when I see a panty line
So if I slap that ass, baby doll, don't trip
Just grab yourself a glass full of my dick and take a sip
'Cause God don't make no junk
And he took his time when he shaped your trunk
Plus he made niggas like me, so baby, don't doubt
Let me prove that I'm servin' my purpose, Diggin' U Out

[Chorus]
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky* (Yes)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Slangin' this dick like dope* (While I'm Diggin' U Out)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky* (Yes)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, break, break, break it down

[Verse 3]
Huh, tell me, is this the dick that makes you scream in pain?
Is this the dick that makes you scream my name?
Is this the dick that you brag about?
Is this the dick you wanna carry in your mouth?
Little Mista Quiksta, baby, don't knock it
I might be slim but I got a big cock
And if it's worth my while, to naked booty style
Then I'ma put on my uniform and give you service with a smile
Do it 'til you're satisfied
The freak is in the meek, and if you're quiet
Then I know you wanna try it
So go on and unbutton your blouse
'Cause I gotta let you know that DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin' house
Givin' ya dick all day but you gotta understand
I can be your nigga but I'm not your man
As long as it's understood, I could keep the dick good
Without a doubt, while I'm Diggin' U Out

[Chorus]
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky* (Yes)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Slangin' this dick like dope* (While I'm Diggin' U Out)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*Fade that monkey 'til it's funky* (Yes)
Dig, diggie, dig, diggie, diggie, dig, dig, diggie, dig, dig, dig it out
*DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin' house*
