[Verse 1: Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you ain't my woman no more
I gave you a chance, I got bitches out there hoeing for
A real nigga, sharing his world and his fat checks
Now your ass ??? complaining while I'm chilling with them hoes next
The different when I rip, or the one I want to get with
Baby tripping, I'm dismissing a ho for the next bitch
I'm rolling, like Kane in control, I navigate
Step to me, you respect me, must I reiterate?
You can't check me, I ain't that brother you're used to
Fade in the brain with that ??? attitude
Just because you got Papa Boo and the nuts I rest in
I ain't that nigga you can freak and be testing
Any questions? Yeah I can be a gentle man
But I'm a G baby, you can't get bent but I can
I want a real woman, not a groupie or a nut ho
You can't check me, things ain't like the folks

[Tweed]
Oh yeah, ring around the hoes, and that's just how the story goes
And Playa Hamm out there stepping on toes
They puts 'em up their nose
But that's a whole nother episode

[Verse 2: Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, you need to sit back and observe this
And I don't give a fuck if I get on your nerves, bitch
Cause I'm living good, and you want what you can't have
Some you took for granted, so now you feel the wrath
For the half and hot laugh, I know you want a cut
I wouldn't give you the pleasure of tasting my nuts
I'd rather jack off (Bitch!) And serve it to the curb
Than give you any type of action like that you little birds
So now you get served, I know you homeboys is shocked
I bet you had them bitches thinking you still had me locked
But not the Playa Hamm, playing no favorites
Taking no prisoners, and I say baby I'm with this on hock
Is she in it to win it? She can't lose, you need naw ass
I draw the line, baby gon' bump it or go out with the trash
We got an understanding, and my true is gon' affect this
Already knew like you know now, you can't check me

[Tweed]
Aw yeah, either shit or get off the pot
And if you can't let ??? rock
Park your crab extention nails down the block
And take that busta-ass nigga with ya

[Verse 3: Playa Hamm]
You can't check me, sucka fall in, take your place
Cause we don't just eliminate boy, we erase
No trace of your purpotrating ass will they find
No clues, no witnesses, no body, no crime
My family and I are compelled to this realness
Sword to uphold PPC and its chillness
Yeah, I'm that nigga, that gravedigga figure
Take a sucker good care, I ain't have to pull the trigger
You'd better recognize what you're up against and blend in
My brothers already want your head in the den
Monkey-ass nigga, tuck your tail and your head roll
Go tell that to them chicks and them hoes
The players you think you got, got my back and I theirs
And like my classic Cadillac we gonna roll for years and years
So good luck, bucking young bolt, don't disrepect me
I'll play you like a pussy ho, you can't check me
