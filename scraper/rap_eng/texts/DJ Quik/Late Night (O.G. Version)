[Intro: DJ Quik]
Hey 'Pac, it's yo' boy Quik
Man so far I've been listenin' to your album
And I ain't heard nuttin you could just kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah like that
Some of that old smooth shit
Some of that shit that make niggas drink
Make bitches think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahah
So why don't you do a favor nigga and uh...
Drop that shit only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I'm barely standin', and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors it's a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights, cause we like
Yo' nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin', welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a C-note
Lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some Indo
Tongue-kissin' out the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin' bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be poppin' so I'm stoppin' at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try
In the late night

[Hook: Sample & 2Pac]
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
(In the late night!)

[Verse Two: AMG]
Now that my nigga ‘Pac is out I’ma have to hit him
Swoop him up in the coupe
With the window’s tinted, wait a minute
Nigga you got the bud I got the Henney
Don’t worry about the pussy cause there’s plenty
Now in the city of L.A
I’m the mayor to the player’s
Suede to the gators, millionaires baby no haters
Now we up in the mix
From ’91 to ’96
Stackin’ the hit’s and fuckin' tricks
It’s a G thang, baby I’m the AM
From the Bay to L.A
This is how we play ’em
We get around, fuckin’ hoes then we dick ’em down
Death Row is the name, DJ Quik the sound
Ballin’ for day’s but you never catch us slipping’ nigga
I got old and wise and now I’m gettin’ richer
Picture a nigga in the villa gettin’ fame again
All you hoes better know what game I’m in
From L.A.X. to Laguardia, the late night partiers know
Who got the pussy and the Indo
Me and 2Pac and Quik makin’ niggas sick
Hookers ridin’ the dick
And want to join in the clique
In the late night

[Hook: Sample & AMG]
“Last night.. last night changed it all”
(Yeah bitch in the late night!)
“Last night..”
“I don’t give a fuck, where you gon’.. be”
(This one’s for you ‘Pac nigga, in the late night)
“Last night.. last night changed it all”
(Uh, In the late night)
“Last night..”
“I don’t give a fuck, where you gon’.. be”
(Ayo Quik)
(Tell ’em how it is)

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Now I’m kickin’ it at the top of my tree house
I’m runnin’ outta beady so I gotta get down and be out
Now on my way to the store
I see bitches galore that say they never ever been to a studio before
Now it’s a golden opportunity for me to get tossed
I got work to be done, and bitches to floss
She say she *Nikki with 2 K’s, i’m dickin' with 2 balls
And all we need it Hen’ to set it off
Now those are the days of my horny and rugged adolescent
Fuckin’ bitches with no rubber’s today is a lesson
Now we stop to get "Lifestyles" because i'm a gent
Yo, what’s ya’ flovour baby
Hope it’s nutty peppermint
Fuckin’ bitches on a weekly basis I’m lovin’ to play
But tell me why always turns out this way?
She be alright when you meet her
Fine when you drunk and fuckin’ and ugly as hell the next day
(What you say?)
Now, in ’96 this is how it’s goin’ down
Player’s like 2Pac and AMG up
And them hoes down
And baddies, no need to feel sorrow
Just tune in, same Bat channel tomorrow
But in the late night

[Hook: Sample & DJ Quik]
Last night.. last night changed it all”
(Yes in the late night!)
“Last night..”
“I don’t give a fuck, where you gon’.. be”
(Don't be mad hoe, just come back in the late night )
“Last night.. last night changed it all”
(I ain't fuckin' with you, only in the late night )
“Last night..”
“I don’t give a fuck, where you gon’.. be”
