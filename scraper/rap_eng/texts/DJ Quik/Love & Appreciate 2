[Hook]
What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

[Verse 1]
Now it had to all start with a broken heart
Some dude got hurt and it was ripping him apart
So he, he made him a song
Cause he was tired of the pain and the getting done wrong
But how long will it last?
You can't keep comparing them to women from the past
It's time to move on
Open up your heart so you can sing a new song
You ain't a pimp you just pissed off
Meet the right woman and you get soft
Used to try and play hard
Now you buying chocolate and valentines cards
And man..that's a good thing
Showing these kids what the word love should mean

[Hook]
What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing it, you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

[Verse 2]
Can't live with them, can't live without them
But I love a whole lot more than I hate about them
They look good feel good and smell even better
So why you acting like your mama didn't use that leather?
B word this, h bomb that
In the midst all of this I wonder where your moms at?
Cause if she ain't one, then tell me where the hate from
You just calm down and maybe you can date one
Buy some flowers, open up some doors
She needs some tampons, homie go to the store
Vitamin water, a bottle of motrin
Teddy bear, candy bar something, a token
Of affection, a step in that direction
Cause love is about progress not perfection

[Hook]
What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing..you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady

[Verse 3]
You love your homeboys, but you hate these ladies
Your gonna chose them over her, you crazy?
The ones you post up with, smoke blunts with
Y'all share the same spit, you might as well kiss
Now don't get me wrong, I love my dudes
But I'ma pick a girl anytime I gotta choose
I like mad, but I love orgasms
And I'm not trying to have the same problems your having
Cause your confused the scared little dude
Beatin' on your lady cause your in a bad mood
Your insecure, a little unsure
Don't know how to deal with the feelings so pure
It's called love, it's joy and pain
But you gotta take some risk to enjoy the game

[Hook]
What you need is some love and appreciation
Gotta treat her like a queen before she walk away
Before it's too late, you gotta..sing..you better treat her like a lady
Oh ahh, treat her like a lady, shes that special lady
