Verse 1

Something like a 64 I RIDE THE flow on lean
Do you like the sh*t that got wane and chris thinking they red ragging
If ni**as bang you in Cali Loc I’m gunning at you
Trigga finger firm breath steady fuc* running at you
Sh*t I probably only burn .4 calories
To let these bitc*es know gang banging not R&B
Instead of notes its kays, instead of stage its blocks
On the set Ill make Chris Brown Dance like Michael with the Glock
How he grew up doin, we seen the films already what the fuc* you proving
On my mama for I Could talk, two years under 4
A Oxnard police raid pancaked me battle ram through the door
So how the fuc* was I supposed to grow up dancing
With two broken collar bones and broken hands bitch
Your only squabbles with Rhianna drake and frank ocean
Microphone Mafia dare you test my California Loc’n
Now I’m back to the block where ni**as do stocks off pot
And who the fuc* caught slipping in the OX
Through the St. Louis City bricks since six
I’ve been ducking shots from grown men off hennesy
With revolvers tommy guns and gauges
Im talking about sh*t that ain't even got nothing to do with gang banging
The damu card probably in the hundred thousand
How many successful ones done started Chris Browning
And Wayne came out of the Pen and dissed New York
So every dope beat he ever rap on I gotta torch
Like madden hit sticking at the surface of the sun
Nicki yo hottest artist ever thats her home town sun
Or maybe not cause sometimes she switch that
Like talk with a european accent, sitting on the back burner of a chick flick
Cause they want to manipulate her acting, they doing role models kim kardashian
From gabriel union to the chick the prince of england married
If muthafuc*as think racism barried, lets say fuc* slave retribution and promote gays getting married
And hope tv and the media and socially manipulated conversation, can psychologically make ni**as feel
Food stamps and unemployment is something better than instant access to education at the cost 5 times
Of what they ever gone be making
America’s profit built on that very foundation, So lyrically I’m masterminding dumb fuc*s information
That they brains can't fall asleep and wake up with
Cause paranoia depression & post traumatic from the same sh*t that white people trained the slaves with
But black parents turn around and do the sh*t raising they kid, and every white kids got a story even worse than theirs
Cause now a days they parents kicking them to the curb, so now you classically conditioned to believe that the shits ok
And even if you reject it how the fuc* you bout to cope, You Just another muthafuc*@ on this earth bout to explode
I’m saying its never been racism no way, cause the haves been fuc*ing the have nots since the early days
They just picking the times to make them broke and mad to come get yo ass
And the budgets is all planned, so everybody checks is on a schedule manipulated by a superior
And up the latter until the sh*ts then multiplied by investors who are split up by success full families across the world United nations is the puppets for the media and the ones with the true status in position to manipulate the
Grants for the programs and business proposals hold the status and hire people to design what they want to fulfill they dreams and die old passing the sh*t down to the next generation, at the end of the day what the fuc* that leave me with, a set of balls, a pistol and common sense, so I’m doing rap songs, potentially won’t exist cause the sh*ts garbage any ways and going to do the same sh*t, that soulja boy romeo and bow wow catalog did
My mixtape catalog reflect a hip hop graveyard, tombstones of hit singles of ni**as flexing like they hard
I want to be famous for making MC’s quit and get a Job, Even if you a gangsta you ain't fuc*ing with the bars
Plus you will have a better chance at that sh*t anyway, I started shooting diss songs what the fuc* the ni**a Snoop Say
He put on some make up and was riding through the city, Old trash and mad, put out A Wack Mixtape with Kurupt and Daz
Ni**a I’m dying on the block shooting ain't no pass, You could see it in my eyes gone test my wrath
Reflect a gorilla out the jungle but I do good math, I hit a composition call of duty team deathmatch
Rolling 6 ni**as deep with the 805 tag, Doing competition 25 straight except with the tracks
