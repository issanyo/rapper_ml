[DJ Quik]
Yeah, haha
Back up in this muthafucka for the nine-deuce
And the nine-tre
And right about now I'd like to thank my muthafuckin' homeboys
For comin' out to rock on this one wit' me
My niggas 2nd II None, my nigga AMG, my nigga Hi-C
JFN, the funky white nigga, haha
My nigga Playa Hamm, what's up, dawg?
The whole muthafuckin' original, Penthouse Players Clique
Haha, my nigga Eazy-muthafuckin'-E, yeah
And a special thanks, to my nigga, the fonkiest muthafucka whoever tuned a bass guitar, a lead guitar, a piano, and the freak-boards, my nigga Rob muthafuckin' Bacon, yeah
And to all you wannabe producers, he ain't for hire, fools
So you better go hire Stan "The Guitar" Man, or some goddamn body
'Cause he ain't for that shit
To my niggas, Sexy Leroy and the Lovelitez
My nigga Top Dawg and my homegirl Shello
With the vocal that's mellow
'Cause we can do that, ha
Now right about now I wanna change it up a little bit
I would like to thank all of these no singin'-ass R&B musicians
Who think that rappers have no true musicianship
This is one for y'all
And may yo' wack-ass albums continue not to sell
And to that nigga Tim Dog, thanks for acknowledging that I'm the fonkiest muthafucka in this business
And also, boy yo' mama can suck a golf ball through a water hose, that bitch is good
And plus I wanna thank my muthafuckin' family
And all the rappers from Compton, except one
A no-rappin' monkey-faced one-hit havin'-ass simple-minded punk muthafuckin'-ass nigga from CMW
Yeah, ya punk bitch
I'd like to thank Profile Records and my girl Cookie
And Shabby Bleu, you always last but not least
'Cause we the two flyest muthafuckas in this industry
Piece of pussy
And we out
I mean gone
