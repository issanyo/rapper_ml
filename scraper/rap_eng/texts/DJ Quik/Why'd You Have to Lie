Yeah
If you done told me you wanted to do her
Boy, you probably coulda took her home
We coulda took her clothes off
Peel the sheets back
And detour to what she came here for
If you done told me you wanted to do her
Your request, I would never deny
You know I don't care about you wantin' to fuck another soul
Why did you have to lie?
Why did you have to lie?

Any other nigga would be too glad
(Any other nigga would be too glad)
To have the kind of relationship we had
(Kind of relationship we had)
My heart feelin' like bullets ricocheting inside
The trust we once had, has died

If you done told me that you wanted to do her
Well, we probably woulda took her home
We coulda took her clothes off
Peel the sheets back
And detour to what she came here for
If you done told me that you wanted to do her
Your request, I would never deny
You know I don't care about you wantin' to fuck another soul
Why did you have to lie?
Why did you have to lie?
Why did you have to lie?
Ooooh, why did you have to lie?
Lie, lie

Wasn't I good to ya baby?
Didn't I please you baby?
Wasn't I good to ya baby?
Didn't I please you baby?

You shoulda told me that you wanted to do her
We probably coulda took her home
We coulda just peeled the sheets back
Detour to what she came here for

You shoulda told me that you wanted to do her
You shoulda told me that you wanted to do her
You shoulda told me
You shoulda told me
You shoulda told me
You shoulda told me
You shoulda told me
You shoulda told me
