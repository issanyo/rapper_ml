I don't get it
I mean you niggas claim to be riders and thugged out
And super OG and all that old shit
But for real, what would you really rather be doin?
Would you rather be in these streets scrappin and shootin with these niggas
Or somewhere with a blunt in your mouth
Getting ya dick sucked by a bad ass bitch? (Yeah that's me) Hm?

Now Super Socka with Gin and Seagrams and sweet and sour
Sippin, suckin on my sausage gave the stripper some power
Limpin everytime she get lead, you come poppin that shit
Then wimper like a little puppy when your walls get hit
Suckin ya thumb I make ya cum, one by one
Till we both get up the mountain and just pop like guns
Composure, if I keep it past the two-minute mark
I'ma bang till the sun peaks so you in the dark
Cus I'll lick you for 15, make you steamy and cream
Then lick you for 30 more cus I'm a nympho's dream
What the dealy? We stay like peanut butter and jelly
Pull apart when you get silly then just eat on ya belly
Don't go tell him, it was me that had you all in the Cut
Cock in ya twat, tongue in ya ear, thumb in ya butt
Making you nut, my nuts they endorse your chin
I graduated from ya cock and took the course again
Now can we...

*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "You can buy me a beer"
*Get Loaded* "I'll buy you a beer...to help break the ice"
*Get Loaded* "A whole lot of ass...back in those days" "You better know it"
*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "Oh, fuck me good baby"

Well I met this bitch, she hard like a man
5'6, ass thick with a crispy cream tan
Jawbone like no other and quick to get another
Hooker just like her to come stroke y'all bird
She be hummin on your balls, never wear no drawers
Lift her skirt up out in public, pager overflowed with calls
Ditchin outta school to come and kick it with y'all
Givin you braggin rights for the homies when she hand you a bra
But she married now, got a husband and kids
Tryin to settle down, shake all them niggas she did but bitch
Age'll never take the freak out of a freak
You gon still want a different dick 3 Fridays outta week
One day I bumped into her at the car wash
With her kids, titties fell, and her ass was all squashed
Sayin "I go to church and I live with my spouse"
"But follow me and let me drop my kids off at pumpkin's house"
"So we can..."

*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "Can buy me a beer?"
*Get Loaded* "I'll buy you a beer...to help break the ice"
*Get Loaded* "A whole lot of ass...back in those days" "You better know it"
*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "Oh, fuck me good baby"

I took ya from Boone's to Don Pi, free-styles to MTV
Demo tapes to my new CD
I'm still the God to your Vertical Joyride
And will, coat your whole hide with fluoride
When I smack that ass don't forget ya chips
When I slide between ya titties better wet ya lips
I'm the imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight even though they are dikes
When she grabbed the mic, it felt like she had two tongues
KY'ed the (?) and then stroked the two buns
It was fun and all
But one of my balls was stuck up in the sugar walls
Y'all had to pull and push
Man the fuckin push was pull
Mixed with Belvedere and Red Bull
Shit I took (?) pimp and thought what the fuck?
And tried to stick my other nut up in her butt so she can...

*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "Can buy me a beer?"
*Get Loaded* "I'll buy you a beer...to help break the ice"
*Get Loaded* "A whole lot of ass...back in those days" "You better know it"
*Get Loaded* "Get yo ass drunk" "Oh, fuck me good baby"
