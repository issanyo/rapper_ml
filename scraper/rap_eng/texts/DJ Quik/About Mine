[Intro: Trey Songz & Kid Ink]
She ain't doing nothin' wrong
Egh, Trigga, Trigga
It's Kid Ink
(Mustard on the beat ho)

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
In the club and this nigga looking at me kinda strange
I got the woman he love sipping my champagne
But she ain't doing nothing wrong, she just fucking with a young, rich nigga
Tell that boy stop acting like a bitch nigga, you should get some money, why you bullshitting?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You should get some money, why you bullshitting?
My nigga you should get some money, why you bullshitting?
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
You could bet that, check my stats, from way way back nigga we've been doing this
Same old clubs and the same bitches you just met, nigga I ain't got time
If the bezel ain't diamonds, presi Obama, pool in the Bahamas, black ferragamo
Need me some condoms, we fucking up commas, honest
Right now this rap shit is cracking for me, if it didn't work out we'd be back to the streets
See life is a bitch crazier than Kelis, but I'm picturing money, my nigga say cheese
Feel fresh like Axe on me, nah y'ain't gotta put up no act for me
Your girlfriend already said you act so cheap, you should get some money, why you bullshitting?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You should get some money, why you bullshitting?
My nigga you should get some money, why you bullshitting?
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Why you bullshitting
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Why you bullshitting
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
I'm about mine, tell me is you 'bout yours? Yeah she say I'm a dog but she down on all fours
Yeah she down on the floor cause there's money all over, then back on the pole with it
Now I got time, cause now I got change, shit the cup got drank and we 'bout to get high girl
What did you think? I say God to your dress but no you ain't no saint, shit

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
You know you coming to the crib girl ain't cha? You drinking all this liquor girl ain't ch
I'm feeling on your booty girl ain't I? Show you how to have a real good time
So bust it for me, elbows on your knees
We don't care who's looking, Mustard on the beat

[Verse 5: Kid Ink]
Ball hard and yo bitch tryna reach
No it ain't my fault that she's running through the streets
Dumb blonde, got you looking like a fool nigga
Said you should get some money, why you bullshitting?

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You should get some money, why you bullshitting?
My nigga you should get some money, why you bullshitting?
I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Why you bullshitting
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?

[Outro: Trey Songz & Kid Ink]
I got all bad bitches at my table, what I'm gon' do with 'em, all this money that I can't hold
Throw some, taunt it, only bad bitches at my table, that's all I got
Which one of y'all I'ma take home, I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours?
Girl I'm about mine, is you 'bout yours? You should get some money, why you bullshitting?
