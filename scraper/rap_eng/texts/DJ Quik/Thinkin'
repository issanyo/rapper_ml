[Intro]
Yo!
Every little thing she does is magic!
Know why?
Cause she ain't a bitch

[Verse One]
You see...
There was a black man, white man, and a Chinese man and God was giving out hair
He said, "Black man, what kind of hair do you want?"
He said, "Just ball mine up and throw it here." [laughter]
Don't nothing come to sleepers but dreams
And then you wake up with reality in the distance, spinning and thinning please
Don't do me... yo
No damn favor
Yo, you hate me cause I pimp a prostitute?
You think I'm playin' nigga?
After you
Now here's a person, here's a place, here's a thing we call it game
Oh yeah, your glasses before you enter, cause me and you, we don't see the same thang
I dance low, low, low, lower, lower, lower
Hair flying bounce you notice
I ain't for play
No day
I mean every motherfucking word that I say
What's fly to me is that the real ones
Catch on, bring you up
Respect the game, look out for daddy and know to shut the fuck up

[Hook]
I'm driving
I'm thinking
Checking out my business you better believe me!
Hoeing
Prostitution
Tell me partna what is yo' solution?

[Verse Two]
Do what you say
Say what you mean
Cause one thing leads to another!
But I guarantee that understanding me
I'll prolly make you pop a plea to your brother
City lights, heavy traffic just makes my day
Cause when I send my hoe to work she catching date after date
While you sitting there wanting to lay up
Look bitch, ain't you got something to do today
Or somethin you playa hater?
Can't wait to leave sometime like five days ago
When I left saying "Once a hoe always a hoe!"
I got a mack attack, I got a Tac attack
I got a tee tight turka tacka jack
Turn to me, we got to move the P
We got to wam bam pimpin' Suga Free, ooh wee
I wear co-co, inch dog and creasy sack
When Tone sat down his gat, stepped back and told this nigga
"Peep me to that!"

[Hook]
I'm driving
I'm thinking
Tell me partna what do you believe in?
Is it money?
Now, is it power?
Pimp I, pimp I, pimp back, hour for hour, hour

[Verse Three]
My people built this motherfucker and I know my way around
You see the same ole' faces going up, coming down
And I still can't read
And you ask me if I'm qualified to give you motherfuckers just what y'all need
I got a problem cause I'm fresh out the penitentiary baby
And I admit I'm antisocial and it's driving me crazy
At least in prison there's a guard tower
For level ones, level twos and level threes hour after hour
So many memories of struggling with my bed roll
'85 camp Miller, 2001 out of Adelanto
The inmates asked me how I catched this case
They couldn't believe that Suga Free was right there in they face
The whole yard told another yard before I left the R and R
I tried to make my bed but I was signing autographs hard
Homies giving me noodles and chips and shit
My bunkie Dee said, "Man I know you miss that nigga Quik."

[Hook]
I'm driving
Still thinking
I don't know why I'm doing so
Much drinking
But I like it
And I need it
Bitch you just gon' believe in who you believe in
I'm leaving
Don't you ever invite your boyfriend

(rhythmic mumbling to fade)
