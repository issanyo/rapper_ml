[Intro: DJ Quik]
All the ladies in the house
All the ladies in the house (good morning)
To all the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good afternoon)
To all the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good evening)
All the ladies in the house
To all the ladies in the house (good lord)

[Hook: DJ Quik]
To all the ladies in the place with class and taste
Allow me to place my hands on your waist
And we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie
On the dance floor boppin' with me
To all the ladies in the place with style and chase
Allow me to place my hands on your waist
And we can boogie till you conk out, faint like Marie
On the dance floor boppin' with me

[DJ Quik]
Now I'm not barely Alvin Ailey
But I make fly dance music daily
I may never dance the ballet in the Valet
But you just might see me two steppin' the valley
If that's a real expensive car in the alley then it might be me
Playin' hookey from your local TV
But I'm flyer than an EB, extraterrestrial biological entity with Elliot but you call him ET
Now let's get your BMX ready Let's ride it out
Let's do me like drew Barrymore and let's hivey out
Give me to call home, let's dial it out
That could cost 320 million dollars a minute, now why wait
Why not just call me gray?
Why not just call me Blake?
I spend enough time on the airplane
Why not just call me Frey?
Why not just call me late?

[Hook]

[Ice Cube]
To all the ladies, to all the ladies
From the 80's, up in Vegas
To all the ladies from 90's
You can find me wherever I be
I'm still gonna flow 2010
Still gotta about two thousand to spend
Haters in the place can't erase my grin
Stuck on my face when I'm with my friends
When I bust a rap to a DJ Quik beat
We get green just like Bill Bixby
Turn into a beast and you a beauty
Know I'm a player, will you recruit me?
I got game, and you got to tailgate
Let's have a party, girl why the hell wait
Let's have a ball, get her up from the table
If she don't wanna dance find one that say...

[Hook]
