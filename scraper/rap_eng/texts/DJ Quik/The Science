[Intro]
So I'm at the barbershop
And we talking about this new generation of hip-hop
And how, how lost you all are, man
But y'all have no science
So here you go

[Verse 1]
The systematic knowledge of the physical world
Gained through observation and experimentation
Usually beginning with a hypothesis
Or what some may call an estimation
Record your results from a series of tests
And what you're left with is a theory at best
Now let me give my hypothesis, an educated guess
On why my people on the whole seem to be such a mess
Genocide: the deliberate extermination
Of a race, culture, or an entire nation
Centuries ago they brought us here on a boat
Enslaved us, beat us, til our spirit was broke
Then they gave us freedom and a little bit of hope
Then they killed our leaders and they gave us dope (crack)
From the C.I.A. by way of Nicaragua
Shipped to Rick Ross, he’s the black Godfather
Now Oscar Blandón was his known supplier
He snitched on Rick so that he could retire
Ratted on Ricky so he got out quickly
Now this is where the situation gets a little sticky
Not a citizen of the U.S.A
He got released and got hired by the D.E.A
Then he got his green card from the I.N.S
But that should’ve never happened due to previous arrests
See our government seems to think that there is a difference
Between powdered cocaine and crack, for instance
You get five years for five grams of crack
But in the powdered form you have a hundred times that
Now who has the rock, and who has the powder?
Who’s the oppressed and who has the power?
They want you to fail so you wind up in jail
You know how much they make while you sittin in that cell?
Billions of dollars for inmate facilities
You sell yourself back into slavery willingly
It's not black and white, it’s so much more
It’s the rich stayin rich and the poor stayin poor
The poor white’s meth, the poor black’s crack
It’s not about race and once you realize that
We as a nation are free to move on
And become one people, a movement, strong

[Hook x2]
Droppin this science
Murs is a scientist
Droppin this science while they drop bombs

[Verse 2]
Now black people weren't the first to be enslaved
We were just the first to be treated this way
No education, you were killed if you could read
So you hid your intellect if you wanted to succeed
And what happens to a lie when you livin' it
You lose sight of who you are and start forgettin' it
So many of us to this day act ignorant
A mere shadow of our form of magnificence
Welfare: no independence
We become victims dependin' on the system
Looking for a handout waiting on some help
Dwelling on the past feeling sorry for your self
But you do what you can to make it out the trap
And that right there is the origin of rap
It wasn't always played on every radio station
It was us makin the best out of a bad situation
Inner city schools stopped teaching us instruments
We took turntables and started flippin' it
Stole electricity from the street lights
Plugged it into a system and made the beat hype
There was a mic but MC's weren't rulin'
It was more 'bout what the DJ was doin'
He say a few words (GO, GO) to keep the party movin'
The B-boys dancin' to the breaks and the grooves
And the break was the part where the record broke down
Where it was just a drum and a couple of sounds
You had two records you could go back and forth
To keep the groove goin' cause the break was so short
Now if that ain't' science I don't know what is
The ingenuity of these young black kids
The Bronx New York, Sedgwick & Cedar
Kool Herc earth hip-hop true believers
(Theory) Adversity produces opportunity
Anythings accomplished through strength and unity
The fate of the world is in the hip-hop community
The revolution's here and now with you and me

[Hook x4]
