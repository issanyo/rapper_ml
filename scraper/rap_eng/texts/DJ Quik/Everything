[Verse 1]
One, two
She was only fifteen, in love with bad R&B
She had to have vision because she saw the star in me
Encouraged me to write about the drama in my life
To most it seemed strange like something wasn't right
I used to fall a victim to them lunch room comedians
Something like an Outkast, started smokin' weed and then
I sorta fell into my own
Kinda felt at home when behind a microphone
But on the bus ride home
That didn't mean a thang
Harassed by thugs, on the corners they would hang
I got banged on
I got beat down
Carrying a golf club, walking up the street now
They respect me
They call me crazy
At least I'm not gettin' punked out on the daily
And when I look back I wouldn't change a thing at all
Where do you think I found the strength to be speakin' to y'all?

[Hook]
I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

[Verse 2]
God is love then hatin' is Satan
Zen-type patience, got me sittin' here waitin'
On the day when it's okay to love
When black men won't pretend that they are thugs
When teachers and doctors are treated like celebrities
You can get a job even if you got a felony
Check out my melody, let's live in harmony
We in this together, no man has autonomy
No man is an island, immune to the violence
This rap race is no place to raise a child in
What's wrong with smilin'? What's wrong with peace?
What's wrong with squashin' beef before they label you deceased?
Swallow your pride before you choke on your issues
I know you got family and folks that'll miss you
So don't misuse this gift you've been given
This life's but a dream you are blessed to be livin'

[Hook]
I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die

[Speaking]
And basically man, I'm just a dude who tries to do right
You know I try to make my tomorrows better than my yesterdays
Without hurting anyone else in the process
Cause if you leave the world a better place than it was when you got here, then we all win

[Verse 3]
Now, there's birth and there's death but the space in between
Is where the journey takes place and you give it all meaning
There's waitin' on us all, there's no need to pretend
No freedom in the feeling when youâ€™re fearing the end
All good things come to it, walk, don't run to it
At times you want to end it all yourself, don't do it
Be original, be different
Be the one that stand up and shocks this system

[Hook]
I take everything
Your hopes and your dreams and your hate and your lies
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone
From the old and the wise to the young as they fly
Ooh, when I die
I take everything
Mmm, mmm, mmm, in this life
I'll join everyone

Cause all men die
