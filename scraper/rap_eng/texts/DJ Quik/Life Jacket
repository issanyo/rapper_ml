[Chorus: Keisha Smith]
Woe is me
I can't get my bread up when it's so easy
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas
All I need, someone to look out for me
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)

[Verse 1: Suga Free]
Ain't it so sweet, how I emerge
Making richy glitzy bourgeois people
Come party with us, kick it  and splurge
So I'ma [Suga Free] and keep me a life jacket on
Take the bitter with the sweet
And keep my hookers in the street
And keep [Suga Free] oh yeah
I'm on my way up to glory with this one this time dammit
Because I heard there's more there [Suga Free]
This can only be done by us
Now beg this pardon for me
Turn it up one good time and get the money [Suga Free]
Oh my God, I'm Quik like
[Quik: 'You love California for the gold, right?']
Nah, the broads [Suga Free]
Bitch, the shit I told you not to do today applies for every day, ho
Get it straight [Suga Free]
Shit, did you fuck me?
[Quik: What?]
You mean, you stayed home, bitch
Because your dog had puppies? [Suga Free]
Yeah, after I get off ho, take that Long Beach out, then sunset
Come back home and get my neck wet

[Chorus: Keisha Smith]
Woe is me
I can't get my bread up when it's so easy
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas
All I need, someone to look out for me
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
I'm in a Chevy with the top dropped
I parked both Benzes, but neither's in the shop
I'm on my third Rolex, but show me what's next
And I'll bet I'll do get it, do it, done it — dag gum it, I'm a mess
And when I play this guitar, it's goin' make my dick hard
Something like the Scarecrow, Michael Jackson, fuck the Wizard
I should have gone Gilliard, bipolar is Julliard
Either extreme, I'll kill you motherfuckers on the schoolyard
Checks off, inbound — watch the Quiksta get down
I hate a hacker — hacky players need to go back, sit down
'Cause if you ain't with the now, that makes you way back when
And you can keep all of that retro-dated action
Now get up on my time zone, quit workin' with limestones
Switch that shit for marble and granite
Produced Whitney and Janet
Oh. you can't — nobody else on this planet
It's just me, I'm a plant
And I'm so dope, you can't handle it
I'm rhymin', you ramblin'
I rhyme and you ramblin'

[Chorus: Keisha Smith]
Woe is me
I can't get my bread up when it's so easy
I can't keep my head above the stormy seas
All I need, someone to look out for me
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)
Toss me...(A life jacket)

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Yeah, tryna burn somethin'
Buy a lot of books these days, tryna learn somethin'
Cars that ain't got no miles, tou know my style
See me and be like 'wow', she so aroused
Had to let the windows down, you know the crown
The all black White Sox hat, it's goin' down
Take a nigga shoppin' or somethin', don't be frontin'
Told everybody we datin', no we wasn't
We was just havin' some fun, then you tripped
Talkin' that relationship shit, then I dipped
Went to the studio, quick, Got with Quik
Told him 'let me get a 16', made a hit
The O.P.M. money, legit, I keep countin'
Last week I made ten records off three ounces
I'ma need a house with a view and like three fountains
Just a little something for my niggas to keep bouncin'
Uh, 'cause we don't dance much
I still sag and pull my pants up
Aye, y'all should start doin' stand up
You sold records, pull them scans up
Aye, said my niggas pull them vans up
Aye, now you niggas understand us
Yeah, DJ Quik hooked the jam up
Sound like he hooked the band up
Suga Free, I'm a fan, bruh
Aye, damn, this finna fuck the land up
Uh — 'cause it'll never stop
Your style is like lemonade, it'll never pop
Every time you on TV, I don't never watch
I'm the one who created the game, I can never flop
Rest in Peace to Etta James, she's in a better spot
This summer I'm making fur and wearing leather hot

Yeah, DJ Quik, you're the greatest
