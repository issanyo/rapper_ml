Head on collision
R3V up the engine
Leave your head missin
Rebel vandalism, Yes most certainly
Quick this the Smash-Smash
We might well call it a crash derby
Dont worry I come with it
Right tracks like Southern Pacific
No topic or Specific
Im just flexing out linguistics
My trains on like conductors on dank
Who wants to hit it?
See Carson in this Bitch
Compton in here too
We been drinking all day long
And ain't no telling what we'll do
Cause we

[David Blake]
Hold up, Hold up
Roll up, Roll up
And let my fam go pour up
Party out in CPT
And nigga we dont need no hold-ups
We got them boys and they all out here
Tell them niggas dont come round here
Fake niggas dont even come close
Cause Compton in here coast to coast
Flickin up from Spruce, Spruce
Pops done let me loose - loose
Niggas out on these tracks
And ain't no telling what theyre gonna do
I ride and look
I see you, I see you
Im standing all over you jokes
Yea, and shout out to Miko
Cause they came here to assist at the plot

When it comes to being solid
I am one of the hardest
I be in Compton chillin
Like im a freaking new artist
When is he going to start it?
Pour out the for the dearly departed
The ones with the Hustle providing the muscle
So i can go further than y'all did
Im on the drum machine drunk
Shooting beats out like a sub machine pump
Look at the rump, She got enough of that junk
Looks like she has cantaloupes in the trunk
On the stage cocking that gage
These niggas all on the same page
Bishop and Quikster and Dave
Doing the nastiest shit to your babe
All aboard

[Bishop Lamont]
Homie show me where
[?]
Ima spit it real like the blood in Jesus
Flashing on them effortlessly
Epilopsy if you listen this might cause seizures
See us, We us, Stay us
And we never adjust
When its never enough
You suckas discuss
You discussing about us
You fucken disgust
So fuckers just shush
Whats up with the murderous sound
They won't see us
Meaning will do a drive by
In a prius still got gas, come back fast
Slpash those fucks
Suck my[?]
Buuuuurrrruuuuuuppppppssssss
P.S
Im just heating up
Atmosphere get eaten up
Im eager, stronger, meaner, leaner
Bout to blow
Fukashima

Its my ambition
My vision man
No losses on my record
Not that business im about
They make them treat me like im treasure yeah
Look on through the rough long enough you'll find a dummy
Ive been searching through this rooms
And found a book that great nostalgic
Told my nigga that Metro rida
Man it ain't gonna last forever
Keep your eyes all on the prize
We gonna laugh at the past together
Locomotive on the door
Thats why they put me on the tracks
Man im warning all you niggas
Dont wanna cross or you get strapped
Yeah

[DJ Quik]
I drive imported cars
Chill with imported brauds
If im not on Metro link
Im linkin at these bars
Drinking imported liquor
Smoking domestic buds
Champainge you know thats my thang
Those Veuve-Clicquot suds
Richie-Rich call me facetime
The limo Escalade
We party secret sundays
Thats LA's escapade
Always more chicks than homies
With or without their thongies
Player elite for life
Dont need alot of cronies
