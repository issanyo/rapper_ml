Hey, this song is dedicated for me and all my homeboys
To the police, y'all gotta start us out
Xzibit dun came im here and got a  nigga high

(Chorus)
Now howcome y'all be messin with me
When you find out that I'm a star? (howcome?)
And just because I'm cool with y'all
Don't mean you can search my car. (1x)
And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex (yeah)
She likes it that I'm always into finer things
And I can donut in an NSX

(Verse 1)
Aight, now first of all fall in
Cause we gon talk about how we was ballin
Before most of y'all niggas crawled in
Bitches callin
Tryin to get the dick of the Quikster
Cause I was rich even before I could buy liquor
Now this is thicker
Although I came to the game with an explicit sticker
It be the little kids acknowledgin that I'm the nigga
I'm sorta like a role model
They love me
I ain't half-assed, pullin full throttle
Now pass the bottle
But hold up for me, pal
Could you make it a corona with Limon Esalle

Limon y sal?
And could you ??(send them in these on so we could show these down)??
So all my little hispanic homies could pound-pound
This is underground-ground
The  new WS sound
But I'm thinkin that y'all thinkin that we all just clown
But we gon  take the crown back
Cause if the west be a movie, then this be the soundtrack, now

(Chorus)
Now howcome y'all be messin with me
When you find out that I'm a star?  (howcome)
And just because I'm cool with y'all
Don't mean you can search my car  (1x)
And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex (cause I don't want it)
She likes it that I'm always into finer things
And I can donut in an NSX

(Verse 2)
Hey, now peep my family
Left to right
We expedite
Nice to you fuckers, then we next to fight
We get down, and get out
When you see them coming, cut the shit out
Cause they gone put us on the bench
And make us sit out
So put a hit out
On the authorities
Cause they thinkin we don't know they got a sorority
Fuck the who?
I ain't sayin hit like in death
I'm talkin hit records crackin
When you bust that left
Outta Carson and Watts
South Central LA, back to your spot
Compton niggas, we got the show shot
Orgasmic beats that keep these hoes hot
Put your lips on my glass, you're doin a whole lot
Ball till you fall, nigga
99 bottles, I'm buyin the whole wall
This is the role call, nigga
All us fly niggas gon ball
If you hatin, then we don't know y'all, nigga

(Chorus)
Now howcome y'all be messin with me
When you find out that I'm a star?  (howcome?)
And just because I'm cool with y'all
Don't mean you can search my car (1x)
And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex  (cazse I don't want it)
She likes it that I'm always into finer things
And I could donut in an NSX

(Verse 3)
Uh, but it's a whole new lineup
Will and Skaboo
Comin through with the brew
Cause KA drunk the wine up
Five in the mornin
And the phone's still ringin
It's been a nine year party
Ever since I started singin "Tonite"
But it's a whole lot betta
It ain't no jealousy, no snitches, or no feda'
I'm gittin drunk
I'm sayin fuck it with my friends
And I'm spoiled cause my muthafuckin bucket is a Benz
And I'm lookin for my niggga X
With the hydroponic, bubonic, bionic
Chase it with some gin 'n' tonic
Now who got the balls enough to hit that bong
And straight pass out cuz the shit that strong?
But the 1's gotta leave us alone
Cause we ain't' doin wrong
I'm the music
And Black Tone's the backbone
Got your daughter back grown
Ebony and ivory, baby
The little white girl
Little black songs, get on

(Chorus)
Now howcome y'all ne messin with me
When you find out that I'm a star?  (howcome)
And just because I'm cool wth y'all
Don't mean you can search my car (1x)
And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex
(we could ball till we fall that's all)
She likes it that I'm always into finer things
And I could donut in an NSX  (I like it too)
Now howcome y'all be messin with me
When you find out that I'm a star?  (howcome?)
And just because I'm cool with y'all
Don't mean you can search my car  (I'm platinum)
And if you don't wanna spend the day with me
It ain't always gotta end with sex  (1x)
She only likes me cause I'm into finer things
And I could donut in an NSX
