[Intro]
Hoo, ooh, last summer
Hoo, ooh, last summer
Last summertime

‘Til last summer
‘Til last summer
Hoo, ooh, last summer

[Verse 1]
I often find myself in thought of the things we used to do
Like late night walks down to the park just to be close to you
I made a big mistake, when I turned and walked away, baby
And now I sit and reminisce on the way it used to be, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun comes up and flowers start to bloom
(And you know that I)
I never thought I'd meet someone like you

[Chorus]
‘Til last summer, I had no one
‘Til last summer, last summer
‘Til last summer, I got no love
‘Til last summer, last summer

[Verse 2]
Now let me try and share the joy and happiness you bring
Why every time I hear your name puts a smile on my face
'Cause I know (Yes, I know) what we had (What we had)
Is more precious, than diamonds and gold (diamonds and gold)
And all the riches in the world could never compare
And the…

[Pre-Chorus]
Sun comes up and flowers start to bloom
(And you know that I)
I never thought I'd meet someone like you
Oh…

[Chorus]
‘Til last summer, I had no one
‘Til last summer, ‘til last summer
‘Til last summer, I got no love
‘Til last summer, until last summer

[Bridge]
And the soul folks sing
Cool, cool, cool

[Chorus]
‘Til last summer, I had no one
‘Til last summer, last summer (Until last summer)
‘Til last summer, (Hey baby, ‘cause you touched my soul)
‘Til last summer, (Last summer, baby
I'll never forget, oh)

[Outro]
You used to turn me in, turn me out
Make me scream, make me shout
I had no love, and I had no one
Until last summer
Makes me say, oh, oh oh oh oh
Say, oh, oh oh oh oh
I say, oh, oh oh oh oh…
