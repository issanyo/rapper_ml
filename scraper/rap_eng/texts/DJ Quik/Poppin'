[Chorus]
Up in the mornin'
I keep it pop-pop-poppin'
Even in the evenin'
I'mma keep it pop-pop-poppin'
When I'm in the city
Gotta keep it pop-pop-poppin'
Down in the underground
Keep it pop-pop-poppin'

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Aye, got the nine-milli automation
When I take aim at the game, penetration
Freeze, stop comparing me to Dre
Before I come through with the scope on the K
And decorate your house with you flesh
Nonetheless, and open of the best, not the stress
Cause we came to get more
Nuh-uh, we ain't takin' less
And I ain't detoxin' wit' it
I'm hotboxin' wit' it
Get it, got it, lit it
Drop it, get it, got it
Niggas stay exotic, we got Henny and hypnotic
Party on the strip, after party at the strip
Party at the St. Regis multipurpose room wit' a grip blood

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Hey-hey, my thoughts slurp is steep
I'mma die like Michael Jackson too
Cause I don't go to sleep
I'mma get it up
I'mma play it like a volleyball and hit it up
I'm gon' keep hittin' these switches 'til it's settin' up
You see my Gucci belt, and my Prada shoes
And my Louis scarf, I gotta lot to lose
I gotta lot to say, but I back it over 'til I pack it up, drive away
KK

[Bridge: KK]
BlaKKazz back in ya ear today
Classic gettin' airplay
All that you gotta say, maybe it's a comeback
Naw, we didn't hear that
Evolution nigga, True Q and True Black
Hey-hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: KK]
Careers gettin' shorter, soundin' like it's strainin'
I been around the world boys, we maintainin'
I'm BlaKKazz packin' a backpack wit' sumin' in it
To blast back all the wack pats, bad back
I'm fired up like L.A. Hillside burnin'
Inspired men learnin', the women lower lips yearnin'
Now see me in the streets or a stage show
Reside me off the radio or Nike commercials

[Verse 4: DJ Quik]
Got 'em runnin' like Herschel, Walker
The stalkers playin' on my cell, I'm about to call the chalkers
City full of male groupies, Eazy said it all first
All you weird bearded queers, you can meet the Fockers
But call first

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: DJ Quik]
KK, why are people so mad at Los Angeles?
How weak of you to let a city make you scandalous
That's pretty basic, I'm disgusted with this hatred
I'm a Compton city patron and I think this city's great when it be poppin'
Now notice that I'm called a patron
If you translate that to Spanish then we all gon' be here late
And we gon' eat up like a banquet
We gon' finish what we drankin'
When you wanna hear some G shit I'mma call my nigga K and get it poppin'
It's 187.fm, now keep us locked in, that hood shit
24 hours a day, we knockin'
K been my friend since a kid, when we lived in Compton
We bang in anything you drive, bitch hop in

[Chorus]
