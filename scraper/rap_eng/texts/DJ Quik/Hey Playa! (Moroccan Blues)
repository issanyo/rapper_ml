“…Nice palm trees...Beautiful…”

(Background singing in Arabic)

We got to adjust to keep it so fresh, so fresh
We got to eject to keep it so fresh, so fresh
We got to adjust to keep it so fresh, so fresh
The way we like it to be and nothing less

We got to adjust to keep it so fresh, so fresh
We got to eject to keep it so fresh, so fresh
We got to erect to keep it so fresh, so fresh
The way we like it to be and nothing less

(DJ Quik)
I’m the Cris Angel of beats, David Blaine on the rhyme
So stop scheming on mine, get ch’all ass in line
Because hip-hop is the music of the devil
So go and bring a beat machine but don’t forget your shovel (your shovel)
And be prepared to lose your lust for sleep because vampires and fires are the company you’ll keep
Don’t be scared, they gon’ disrespect you they gon’ call you weird, but you just might be the last n*gga here
See, I ain’t ‘fraid of death, it’s not livin’ that kills me
And punk-n*ggas that pop they mouth off that so ills me
Gossip like a lady, but you’re the only bitch
In a man, you’re unknown, you’re a nerd, you’re no pro
You’re a scoundrel, you’re the one we all avoid so let’s get back to this party and don’t be so paranoid
I’m the keeper of the key to all creativity
And I will give you writer’s block if you abandon me

(Chorus)
Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you? (wusupp?)
We all dressed up and got nothin’ to do
Me and my girls wanna slide through there
Is that alright? (Why not)  Is that alright? (Not why)

Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you? (wusupp?)
We know what we drink and we brought some, too
Me and my girls wanna come on through
Is that alright? (Alright)  Is that alright?

(Kurupt)
When the festival ends, the night life begins
I’m sure the more she see me she’ll begin to adore the sky view
The sore we soarin’, I’m sure the more she sees me the more in I am from now until the mornin’, I’m in!  I’m in the mornin’ soarin’ cloud nine
She got two sides like Geminis, I’m I.  Livin’ my life I’m hella high
I’m fine. (I’m fine) And it’s time. (And it’s time)
See I’m nothin’ but a fool, I’m cool, I’m coolin’, doin’
Whatever I wanna be doin’.  You and me
Me and you and my big hommie DJ Quik
Your friend is so thick, give her to my uh, let’s dip, let’s do it
Brazilian atmosphere without a brazier
Bring those big ol’ bitties over here then she said:

(Chorus)
Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you?
We all dressed up and got nothin’ to do.  (To do.)
Me and my girls wanna slide through there
Is that alright? (Why not)  Is that alright? (Not why)

Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you? (wusupp?)
We know what we drink and we brought some, too
Me and my girls wanna come on through
Is that alright? (Alright)  Is that alright?

(Kurupt)
Look, the more I think about it the more I gotta laugh
I’m having the time of my life, I’m livin’ the life that I like
In case you didn’t know, the sky’s ‘grabbable’
I’m too far from the ground to come down
With eyes like Rhianna, face like Paula
Patton essential as the Latins girl, what’s happenin’?
It’s just me, that’s myself, I am I.  I’m diggin’ you and me, why not? Not why!

(DJ Quik)
And I’m the voice of great antiquity; I’ll stop you at the gate
And present you with nightmares of all the things you hate
Remove you from Hootie love, I’ll keep you trapped in your mind
Unable to find the drawstrings to the blinds
And let your light shine through, you might slide through
But believe me, I might find you
I’ll make the sun thicker, your poison is my liquor
I’m that much “Quiker”

(Chorus)
Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you?  (Wussup)
We all dressed up and got nothin’ to do. (Yeah)
Me and my girls wanna slide through there
Is that alright? (Why not)  Is that alright? (Not why)

Hey Playa!  Can I holla’ at you? (comeon)
We know what we drink and we brought some, too. (comeon)
Me and my girls wanna come on through
Is that alright? (Why not)  Is that alright? (Not why)
