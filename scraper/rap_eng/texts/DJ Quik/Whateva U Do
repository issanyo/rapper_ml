[Intro: DJ Quik]
Ay, come here miss lady
Check it out, well meet me half way there now
Damn, check this, look
I already know your name is Sheila
Cus I seen you in the front of Players Magazine in the main edition
And it ain't gon' kill you if you give me yo number
What's happenin? Can we hook up later or something? Thank you

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
I like the way that you don't say much
And when the homies give you phone numbers you don't stay in touch
With that proper little mystic about your ways
About your style that got your boy dazed
Now I'm diggin in my game so I can see where you at
And I'm pushin all the buttons that make you come exact
I know you recognize I'm young and I'm gifted and black
That should be enough to have you sprung and fidgety in ya cat
But yet you play it off swell
To see if I'mma give up on the pursuit of your tail
But even if you knew that ain't all I wanted was just to bone it
I'm still detectin ego trippin baby you own it
But you don't understand I know parts of you that you do not
And I can penetrate right down through your through-through spot
Because I'm talented and young and I got a lot wealth
And I'm the bomb baby, now what you tell me 'bout my self?

[Dionne Knighton]
Whateva U Do
You make me wanna touch myself
Whenever I'm with you cus you got it (Who go it?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me (Yeah sing it to me)
Whateva U Do
You make me wanna touch myself
Whenever I'm with you cus you got it (Say what?)
And I'm gonna make you give it to me

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
C'mon, we can go to my house we don't need the hotel
Now lay down by my fireplace and drink Zinfandel
While I massage your feet, and yo massage my neck
And I won't make a move on you 'long ass you got self-respect
Now check it, I wanna see what you look like in spa
With nothing on yo body but yo panties and bra
Grand Marnier in ya flava down your neck and your back
Aha, didn't know the Quiksta could do it like that
You actin different on the liquor baby girl is that you
The ways your eyes sparkled when I bit yo tattoo
You're rugged but soft baby you're sowed up with fears
And you gotta like pleasure and pain with your navel pierced
But I appreciate you lady cus your makin me wait
Even though that little game you playin is much outta date
I'mma save it for next time and I hope you will too
Cus I like the way you do what you do, baby girl

[Will Hudspeth]
Whateva I Do
I make you wanna touch yourself
Whenever I'm with you cus I got it (Girl do you know how bad I am?)
You make me wanna give it to you (Now give it to me)
Whateva I Do
I make you wanna touch yourself
When ever I'm with you cus I got it
You make me wanna give it to you

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
You know you want it I can see it ya face
That you would rather be somewhere with me takin off your lace
To a bikini shavin pubic
I'm a diamond he's cubic
You gave him yo love and he blew it
Move, let me do it
Because my love is like fire and ice I'm like bitter sweet
Me and my peaches, and you and yo pretty feet
Knowin that if I lick it, tell me then I get closa
While I'm urgin you to drink this Mamosa
Because you know that I got the skills that make you get them crazy leg spasms
By helping you to reach multiple orgasms
Ya hear me? Now feel me, you know what's happenin
So hit me on my hip when you wanna get it
And I'll be over there twenty minutes to hit it
Just as long as you stay cool and you stay true
And just keep on doin Whateva U Do, baby girl!

[Dionne Knighton]
