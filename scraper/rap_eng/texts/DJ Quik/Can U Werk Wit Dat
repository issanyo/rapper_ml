[Intro]
Você sempre quer que eu falo coisa p'ra você?
O é que 'cê quer agora?
Você sempre 'tá querendo coisa?
Ah, agora eu entendo
Ah, você quer que eu faça isso?
OK, 'tá bem

[Verse 1: AMG]
I can be a little picky, blame the sticky icky
Pick a bottle get a glass down the sippy sippy
I see you, baby, keep bouncing on your tippy toes
When the beat drop, dip and make your booty roll
Cold piece of work filling out your mini-skirt
It's Saturday night, you'll probably wear that shit to church
You sick of lame dudes frontin' wit' an attitude
Talkin' bout their rims and all they damn tennis shoes
I got some grown man game for your bluetooth
I'm hot, middle of winter coupe no roof
You used to sushi, vino and some calamari
You want a nigga that might grow up and be somebody
O.T resorts by the sea
Sand between toes, umbrella in your drinks
Worldwide AM, hit me on the Gmail
I brought my boy wit' me so bring another female

[Hook - AMG]
Diamonds on my fingers, a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party and seen so many hoes
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
(I can work with that)
Cali to the A, we speeding on the freeway
In the stretch LS, baby, we hood fellas
Can you work with that
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
(I can work wit that)

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Let me do my job, girl, don't make it easy for me
Tomorrow morning, make my eggs wit onions chessy for me
Come get the keys to the suite up at the Sofitel
It's room 1024, and I'mma meet you there
Take a bubble bath get the robe out the closet
And wait for me, don't think that I'm afraid to toss it
You hate for me to stand you up, it makes you nauseous
I'm late but can't go to sleep because your pussy gorgeous
It's Quik, baby, I done dropped the DJ
You might see me in GA just showin' off my LA
So many apple bottom freaks showin' belly
I might give her my celly and take her to the telly
She in the DoubleTree Suites wit' her hands on her hips
A look in her eye and a smile on her lips
It's that southern hospitality, that's my reality
We hit the Waffle House and finish wit' some Alizé

[Hook - AMG]
Diamonds on my fingers, a couple on my toes
Walked in to the party and seen so many hoes
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
(I can work wit that)
Cali to the A, we speeding on the freeway
In the stretch LS, baby, we hood fellas
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
Can you work wit that
(I can work wit that)
