(Dj Quik talking)

Ha ha nothin but the best,from the best
You feel me? hear me
This is dedicated to that special someone
You know who you are, and you never gave me a chance

I used to watch you walk to class,fine as can be
While I'm standing here with K.K. and D
And I did a liitle bit of everything just to get your attention
But I knew you had no eyes for me
I used to get up, sharpen my pencil for nothin
You watch me watch you rollin your eyes and you still was bumpin
So when test time came I was all in yours
With no bubbles on my papers just some low ass scores
I guess you can call it puppy love I was a scrub
Having fantasies of me and you up in my tub
Makin love in the soapy water,having my daughter
But I knew you liked them baller dudes and, I did'nt have a quarter
I admit on the rainy days it was sad
Cause it was'nt about who you was but what you had
Now I'm doing swell baby and you know it's true
Back when you had a chance you should've let me breath on you

(Chorus)

Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin

I'm Sittin in my room thinkin bout you
Reminiscing on the kinky little things we did'nt do
I said I'm sitting in my room thinkin thinkin thinkin

Now I called you on the telephone baby it's david
The last you gave a chance is the first to save it
And I'm just tryin to hook us up for another session
Because I have'nt learned my lesson
Plus I got positions never ending
Now I'm descending down into your valley baby work your tendons
Doing what I do to make you do what you did
To make me come so hard that we almost had a kid
Platinum Thats how I descibe your thigh
Tell me how come your so young doin shit that fly
You must have came from the school of hard knocks
Lickin on hard rocks and blowin off tube socks
Now whenever it's time for fun
You got me blowin up your pager with 911's ha
Now show me a little affection
But hurry up before I lose my erection

(Chorus)

Because I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin

I said I'm siitin on my couch thinkin bout you
Reminiscin on the kinky little things we used to do
I said I'm sittin on my couch thinkin thinkin thinkin
(Check it out)

And now I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you
And you baby doll don't even have a clue
I'm just sittin in my spa thinkin thinkin bout you

I said I'm sittin in my spa thinkin bout you
And I'm doin rather swell in ???? heaven yeah it's true
I'm just sittin in my spa thinkin thinkin thinkin

And thats real good night baby
