[Hook: Chief Blocka]
We just be Hyperizing
While ya'll be criticizing
We just gon' do our thing like ev-ery day - ay
You can't control the style
You get that were too wild
But were just having fun every time we play -ay -ay

[Verse 1: Fog Raw]
Player hating on a player
Girl I'll see you later
See me in the lane no you don't I'm the mayor
I'm here to the ring I'm Fog Raw get it in
We just wanna ball & laugh
What's your prob-lem
When my hands touch the rock (hot)
Look at the poller-taram (Rock)
All the girls love to smile when I deliver
I make their little pompoms quiver, Fog Raw

[Verse 2: Velvet Hoop]
Oooh Weee
It's velvet Hoop
Wrist band full of loot
Right next to ma shoe
Ing. Hand
What's the Temperature Sam 80 Degrees
Or mega De-freeze
Bring the Pumps too the knees
Don't talk about boring Dunks

Now get the hell out ma Garage
Extra Fits in my car
Scoop up, Ice Chief

[Verse 3: Chief Blocka]
Let yo game and yo mind be free
Have fun and you will see
Get your team mates on your side
And show some styleee
It doesn't matter what you are
Short. Fat. Big. Tall or small
No matter how you are
Reach for the starz

[Verse 4: Ice-o]
It ain't my fault you can't hang (Can't hang)
Maybe this ain't cha game (anit cha game)
This is about heart and hustle
If you like staying on the ground maybe you should wrestle
Breaking wonders and the shaggy tops
Make you run after the ball
My crew
Yeea get lost
With a cross
With yo uncles hit the pavement
And the coach looked at me in amazement
You wonder were your age went
My crew never run
Yes we en-hyperize this
Having hella fun (how much fun?)
I said hella fun
Listen hun
Wanna know the secret to ma ride?
Check the Kicks under ma dime
Surprise!

It's flick time (You stand)
I'll deliver
