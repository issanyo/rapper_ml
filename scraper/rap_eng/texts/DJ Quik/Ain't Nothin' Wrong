[Intro: DJ Quik]
Aw yeah, sound like another one of them funky ones
What’s up, D? What’s up, K?
‘Cause since we’re chillin’ on this funky track
Let’s show the people why ain’t nothin’ wrong

[Verse 1: Gangsta D]
Well, I’m The D, a girl’s best friend to all the young ladies
Would you like to chill with someone who’s crazy?
Or is you out to try to fade me?
Ain’t nothin’ poppin’, baby
See, I’m a gangsta, a lover, with two bad brothers
Huh, I never slip because I ain’t no sucka
‘Cause I’m rollin’ like cavi, causin’ much tragedy
Step up if you wanna see how bad I be
On stage, my conduct’s rude
If a girl try to diss me, I’ll treat her like a dude
A love tree liver, fresh rhyme dipper
Step off wrong, I’ll send your ass up the river
Rhymin’ like a bogie, suckas on few
Rockin’ every jam that I ever went to, huh
Can’t you see I just gotta have it goin’ on
Now tell me, what’s wrong?

[Chorus]
Ain’t nothin’ wrong, ain’t nothin’ wrong
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with a little of love, baby

[Verse 2: KK]
Introducing a brotha by the name of the K
I was left with the records of the girls that I lay
In the bed, I knock headboards, don’t see no time for snoring
I’m off of pleasure, girl, although I’m never boring
I’m just a guy with that wink of an eye (wink of an eye)
I’m not for talkin’, jack, so strictly on your back
And in the meanwhile, I think I’ll take a break
Hey, for goodness sake, great
God almighty, all the girls wanna do me
They wanna screw me? Now give it to me now
Ain’t no if’s, and’s, or maybe’s or no kinda playin’
If you ain’t layin’, I ain’t stayin’
No way, no how, just like a greedy cow
Don’t thrill me; come on and milk it now
Hey, I’m long and I’m strong and I know we got it going on
Hey, ain’t nothin’ wrong

[Chorus]
Ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on, ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with a little bit of love, baby

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Yeah, now the Quiksta, will take a different approach
You see, I’ll treat you first class just to ride you like coach
‘Cause I don’t cheat myself, I try to treat myself
But to girls, I’m hard to resist, they try to eat myself
Because I’m catching more ladies than a diamond in the window at Saks Fifth
And I’ll consider it a talent or a gift to be uplifting
To keep the girlies shifting to my door
Because they know I give ‘em a little more than just a cookie
I’m not a rookie, I’ll make your girl say “Aw, sookie, sookie”
But if you think that you can play ‘fore you lay me, well, you’re wrong, cat
I never miss what I never had
In fact, I always seem to humpin’, in the end, I cut ‘em loose
And they come because they captivated by my sexy grin
So really ain’t nothin’ with being a lover or a hoe
‘Cause if you cling then we can swing, baby, so let’s go

[Chorus]
Ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on, ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with a little bit of love, baby
Ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on, ain’t nothin’ wrong, come on
Ain’t nothin’ wrong with a little bit of love, baby

[Outro]
Let me hear you say “Ooh, sexy, sexy” (Ooh, sexy, sexy)
Let me hear you say “Tear it off, baby, tear it off”, come on, come on
(Tear it off, baby, tear it off)
Hey, let me hear you say “Itchy, gitchy, ya ya” (Itchy, gitchy, ya ya)
Come on, say “Itchy, gitchy, ya ya” (Itchy, gitchy, ya ya)
Hey, ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)
Ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)

Ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)
Ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)
Ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)
Ain’t nothin’ wrong (ain’t nothin’ wrong)
