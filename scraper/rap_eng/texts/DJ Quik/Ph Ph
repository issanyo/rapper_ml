[Chorus]
Players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Throw your hands up if you're makin' doe
I said players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Hit 'em with the heat to make the people say ho!

[Hi-C]
I'll hit these niggas in the face like a box of rocks
Or push it in your mouth, pull it out your socks
I keep hoes high as a glass of Scotch
And break a bitch out like the chicken pox
When I pull up to the club nigga I don't stop
Be three or four times I done hit the block
I jump up out my ride peepin' nothin' but cock
And some jealous ass niggas starin' at my watch
Hmm, you could have it if you think you can get it
If a rag on your head, you think I won't hit it?
But I didn't come to trip, I came to sip
Pump some ass, and grip some hips
Man it's hot than a bitch, where the fuck is Quik?
Bout to buy out the bar, homie hand me some chips
My nigga start to laugh but he kicked in half
He had everything from Hennessy to Genuine Draft
And I'm knockin' down all ass in my path
But money is the one thing you cannot have
She asked me can she get it so I started to laugh
I ain't never-ever-ever-ever payed for no ass

[Chorus]
Players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Throw your hands up if you're makin' doe
I said players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Hit 'em with the heat to make the people say ho!

[DJ Quik]
Hoe, what ya doin' if ya got no game?
Oh me, my name is pimpin 'cause I got no name
Yeah money buys money, and money sells money
And pussy on a brokedown broad, it smells funny
So peep me in a Jag' playin' keep-away tag
Cause I never met a bitch who done took it and didn't gag
We party in the five-star hotels or the yacht
We party in the back of the limousine hittin' twat
We party independent, so pimpin' don't get offended
If you don't see us, don't worry about nothin', we doin' splendid
Keepin' drama low (low), keepin' paper high (high)
Keepin' hoes wet and my Moet dry
While I'm puffin' on the finest from the good green earth
And I'm fuckin' on the finest bitches I seen first
And I'm spendin' on the flyest, trick gets money in for us
So if you fit the criteria, nigga come aboard
Where the players at?

[Chorus]
Players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Throw your hands up if you're makin' doe
I said players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Hit 'em with the heat to make the people say ho!

[Hi-C]
Ooh ahh, I wanna see some thigh
The thigh lookin' sweet, she wanna see some meat
Or jump in the SUV on chrome feet
And head to the hot spot down the street
We parked the ride, and walked inside
Mmm mmm mmm, damn what a surprise
Some more thick bitches with ass and thighs
Tryin' to get rich, tellin' niggas lies
Baby looked at me and she rolled her eyes
Whispered in my ear that she like the size
Grabbed a handful and I started to rise
By that time I was hot as McDonald's french fries
Ahh, damn baby wait your turn
It's enough to go around girl, you'll get turned
Hi-C and Quik fresh out the Himalayas
Make bitches obey us, if ya don't blow your fuckin' whistle

[Chorus]
Players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Throw your hands up if you're makin' doe
I said players, hustlers, pimps and hoes
Skip your body across the floor
Move your head, shoulders, knees and toes
Hit 'em with the heat to make the people say ho!
