[Intro: Problem]
Let’s get it hot
Problem, Kurupt, Quik
Swag meter up, let’s fly

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Throw your hands in the air
And let me split your little middle part right up to the hairs
Me and your pussy was made for each other
Up above the covers in our sheepskin rubbers
I got two friends, girl, and they my nuts (just two)
And all my ex-girlfriends hate my guts (that’s you)
They out the pond but they still my ducks
And even though we don’t fuck, they still fucked up
Because they know I hit the pussy like an easy pitch
I take a church girl and make her a sleazy bitch
I put out my own records so I’m easy rich
And I’m reppin’ like I’m Ruthless so I’m Eazy Quik
Now let’s fuck one time for Mister Eric Wright
Let’s fuck two times for Mausberg (tight)
Let’s fuck three times, ‘cause three-pack rubbers cost $3.29
And I know you drink wine, so fine

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke (What you really wanna do?)

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
What’s this supposed to be? Who you supposed to break?
Who you supposed to be? What you supposed to take?
You think I give a shit? Man, you’re wrong
It don’t matter if you got a bra on, thong on only
See, I do it by my lonely
Make your best friend wanna bone me
All up on me, wanna bone me, all on me
STOP—think about why
Is it the dick, the grip, the expenditure of chips?
My clique, me and DJ Quik, bitch, what it is?
Tell the truth and shame the muthafuckin’ devil, hoe
Or get hit until you got sense, ‘cause you ain’t got shit
I got a lotta somethin’ for ya though (what?) dick
Now pass it to your friend—now what you wanna do?

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke (What you really wanna do?)

[Verse 3: Yo-Yo]
Old mack and lolitas, courtside seat heaters
Road dawgs, are you kidding me? Three shots of Hennessy
This nigga think he’s boning, young joanin’ on some grown shit
Better buy some Patron and get up on that young bitch
Park the Bentley, roll the SS Impala
And maybe if you like it, push up and you can holla
Now hoodstar wanna take me to Wilshire to eat sushi
And after one puff on the set, you want coochie?
Now that’s when I start acting quote-unquote “bougie”
Could realize, could realize, you could never do me
My nightlife’s my fun life, I’ll give you whatever you like
That’s if you play your cards right
‘Cause I done thangs real niggas are trying to do
So what you, so what you, so what you wanna do, huh?
I’ll tell you what I do, show up like personnel
A bag of all goodies, I don’t kiss and tell

[Chorus: Problem + (Female)]
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
What you really wanna do? (What you really wanna do?)
Tryna drink, tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, tryna poke (Yeah)
I’m tryna drink, I’m tryna smoke (Yeah)
And after that, I’m tryna poke, biatch (What you really wanna do?)

(What you really wanna do?)
(What you really wanna do?)
(What you really wanna do?)
(What you really wanna do?)
(What you really wanna do?)
(What you really wanna do?)
