She pass by... in a black Mercedes..
Damn she fine... the way her body's movin'..

[DJ Quik]
I popped the Perrier-Jouet, tryin' to get the two-way crackin'
Me and you back in the back of the back room
Actin' like you can't come back soon enough to do it rough, cause you a bluff
But I'm a winner, I could hold, watch your pretty legs fold
Stiletto to the metal, panties rose petal print
Pussy with a suttle scent, tryin' to get you double bent
And why the Oak-land, I'm the double stroke man
Sprinkle you with Gucci, rush, then I'll make your coochie bust

[Nate Dogg]
You ain't gotta ask, I'm a motherfuckin' mack and I always get my way
I wanna hit it from the back, wanna give that ass a smack
And I know you wanna taste it
I can tell by the way that she's starin', she wants to come home with me
She wanna sleep with me, she wanna play with me, she wanna lay with me
I can tell by the look in her eye when she pass by

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch
(in a black Mercedes)
But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

[DJ Quik]
I brought the first Puerto Rican here and put her in the club
But L.A. niggas won't give me props, they like scrubs
They love my ho while I fuck two more
Now they shorter than a commode, I watch the game corros'
She turnin' back to her toad, walkin' 'round the players club
Tryin' to bust him a load, drunk, blue balls and trippin'
Now they hittin' the road, staggerin', kissin' the wifey
But she know I'm this old, trickin' is so cold

[Nate Dogg]
Give me - one of those and one of those and one of these
Oh let me please bring these hoes to they knees
We can do this all day, we can do this our way
If you don't wanna play you can hit the highway
Attitudes and your clothes you can leave
Come in a trench coat with some weed
We can have a party like a fantasy
It all happened that day when she pass by

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick
She might be somebody's wife in this bitch
(in a black Mercedes)
But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got some meat on her bones
I love it that she takin' me home

[DJ Quik]
It's DJ Q-U-I-C - my new name
Fresh breathe, drunk as fuck, smashin' on the shoe game
Then the other two came, sometimes pussy feel the same
How much should I pick?, this might be a trick
But which one kills the most, the gang bangin' or the gangbang?
If the bullets ain't rubber, playa it's all the same thang
Get you some money, pussy, and try to maintain
If you rich, keep Kim, don't pull no gun on that other bitch just to keep the trim
You trippin' - and keep her out the family car, put her in the stick
If she ain't BMW material, don't be milk in her cereal
If you get payed for it then you can play for it
As short as the tambourine rings and Nate sings
And T.I.'s on the other song sayin' the same thing
The MBZ, but the pussy is free
So let me fingerbang it with champagne before

[Hook: DJ Quik] (Nate Dogg)
(She pass by)
Can't believe I might be likin' this chick

But she dance like a model, make me wanna bang her full throttle
(Damn she fine)
I'm 'bout to buy her a bottle
And take her out to eat at the grotto
(the way her body's movin')
She got a lot of meat on her bones
And she takin' me home, she takin' me home
