[Verse 1: Dj Quik]
When the dick's good hoes want it down to the nuts
You don't need no Viagra or ExtenZe
Cuz when the dick's good
They put their cushion on your front
And they swing it from left to right until it ends
But then they all catch feelings and the Psycho shows
And that's when they become those passive aggressive hoes
Talkin' bout flippin' it with what she do with her toys
You can't put nothin' in my bitch! I'm a boy!
And if you keep annoyin' me
I'ma pump yo' pussy full of lead
And poison all your ovaries
I'm fly
Too fly
I wish it made sense to say Three fly
But can't because I'm high
Sterile from the barrel
So that means that I'm clean
And I'm so cool I can nut ice cream
Now, how you want it? When you want it?
Come get up on it
If you get it, you gon' get it
You know how I get when I hit it, I split it

[Hook: Dj Quik]
That N*****r's Crazy 3x
Huh? Talking to me?

[Verse 2: Dj Quik]
Niggas in L.A. they talk just like a bitch
Mouth open like ho's pussy
Complete with the drips
You lucky my security don't want it to pop
They looking out for you niggas
If it was me, you'd be dropped
Real men don't gossip and real G's don't plot
If they started what they started
Then they start it, don't stop
If you had as much money as you niggas had words
You'd probably be up on it 'stead of down on the curb
I'm a legend and a playa and a gangsta to boot
The only banger with the key to the city in my loot
I'll put a spell face over me that'll screw up your luck
If you put your mouth on me, potna, you'll be stuck
That's the voodoo that Pirus do
That fly crews do
That fire on tired niggas that block cock like you do
Killa and a prophet, Nostradamus with Glocks
I put it at the trial, only my hair is in locks
Now kick rocks

[Verse 3: Dj Quik]
You wanna know me, You wanna know my mind
I like to make dope beats and hear dope as lines
I like to drink to this cup and have a down ass time
I like multiple bottles, empty, but all in a line
I'm a star, you can only be a co-star here
That should be cool considerin' that you wasn't shit last year
Super Cocky Disc Jockey used to fight like Rockey
I'll Apollo Creed ?_____?
Make you bleed if you mock me
Checkin' niggas on Twitter who want to brand me as bitter
Watch your mouth and bite your lip
Or get it split by a ?________?
Now do any drug you want cuz it's all from the Earth
?______? do some lines, just remember your worth, Fuck it
