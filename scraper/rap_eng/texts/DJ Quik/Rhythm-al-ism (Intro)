[DJ Quik]
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Pimps, players and women of the night
Welcome to the world of Rhythm-al-ism...
Now since this is my intro
I'mma do somethin' a little crazy
Check it out...
We gon' show off a little bit
Now watch it, 'cause these ain't no studio tricks

I glide smooth over any groove to prove that I can keep on flowin'
Lyrics to the rhythm like a ride, got my tongue tied
Chillin' with the D, KK, AMG, Suga Free, Hi-C, El D' and the P-E-N-T-H-O-U-S-E
You'll see a whole 'nother different other side of me
'Cause dissin' don't apply to me
I'll snap my fingers twice and like a bird your bitch'll fly to me
Because she's overwhelmed
You know I kicks the realm when I kick it
My name is Quik and that's the ticket to let me stick it when she trick it
My voice tone hits the trigger
Go deep like a Navy Seal, got her squirmin' like an eel
To kiss her on the cheek is rather bleak
I'd rather run my hand up way up in her skirt and make her squeak, so speak, hold up
If I kick another track to keep you comin' back
Clubs keep pumpin' it, suckas steadily dubbin' it
And I'm gon' keep rubbin' it in your face
Got it tight with the Ism's
Hmm, now welcome to the world of the Rhythm-al-ism...
