[Verse One]
Ho you must be out your motherfuckin' mind
No "ha ha" shit, shut up bitch, and get on some clothes
And put on that shit you came up in here with
Now why you bringin' up old shit?
No wonder that nigga used to go upside your motherfuckin' head
You stupid lyin' half a ho scrubbin' evil bitch
You know go god damn well you wrong
Mad cause you wasn't gettin' no dick
And couldn't fuck with my chips
Bitch, be gone!
Ooh, almighty dollar
I can't wait to pimp that bitch like Muslims can't wait to get to Allah
No, no, no, no, no, no
Tootsie
Pull up your panties
Pick up your shit, wipe off my dick
And don't you GIVE me no more of that pussy
Nah uh
Now that's some pussy you can keep
It's too good

I heard pimp come out your mouth
I guess you want me to know
I'll pull a rabbit out my hat when when you can show me your ho
Mr...You Know He 'Bout To
Oh...and you know I'm finda
Nigga you got pimp player comin' out your mouth
When I know you a termite chokin' on a splinter

Pimp bone connected to my leg bone
Leg bone connected to my ass bone (Pimp or die)
Yeah, for real doe
That's how we do that
Gleek gleek, Suga Suga Free

[Verse Two]
And
Bitch you stank
Now, take your ass to the kitchen
Pour me, Quik, C-Note and General Jeff somethin' to drank
Now jerk is slippin'
Bitch, I'm gonna lay in this motherfucker, hungry and broke
Just because your case worker is trippin'?
Bitch it's your neck
It's not threat
And it's no sweat
It's your mama askin' you, "Baby where yo check?"
Ho, you'se a thief
And if you mistreat my cash
Point blank bitch, I'll beat yo ass
You got that child support check bitch?
Workin' that fast food, think you rich?
Talkin' shit about me cause you know my name
Old bucket head bitch don't know a god damn thang
Lyin' about what you do
What you do
Got me thinkin' what you wanna do
But every time I try to feel her
I end up dreamin' I'mma straight kill her
But you don't even thank me for what I TRY to do
Can't talk without lyin', bitch I'm tired of you
Jealous of my hoes
Jealous of my clothes
You'd probably let me go on national TV
Without tellin' me I got a BOOGER in my nose
Bitch!

[Suga Free talking]
Suga Suga Free
Cause y'all be hatin' like that too. It's time to let the homie know, you know?
Hey man. These niggas ain't the only ones hatin' man
Look at that favorite bitch you like to kick it with all the time
Tell 'em like this

[Verse Three]
Good evening
Believe me
I would like to hang out with you for a minute baby but you're bleeding
I'm standin' on a good foot
But I'm walkin' on a bad leg
I, smacked the bitch
Cause she thought I was a trick
And that's when all the pimp jumped out me
And I turned around and slapped the bitch
She was bold enough to take the kid
And she was bold enough to fuck my friend
The bitch was bold enough to go and snitch
So I was bold enough to slap the bitch
Now, hi Quik
(Watch this)
Wanna see me in 3D
Slowly, go low key and slap that bitch (slap this)
Bitch you wanna be me huh?
You wanna fuck Suga Free huh?
Ho this dick ain't yours
You think I'm free huh?
Man, these hoes is evil
And that's for real
Who can bleed that much a month without dying and STILL
Have my back like you say you do
The only reason she ain't dead is cause Ioveded
What you scared fo'?
My other bitch is gonna sleep with us tonight because I said so
And if you got one thing to say about it bitch you'se a DEAD HOE
Now leave me lone, why you bullshittin'?
Get off my back why you bullshittin'?
Now Quik I'm tryin'
But God, these hoes still lyin'
