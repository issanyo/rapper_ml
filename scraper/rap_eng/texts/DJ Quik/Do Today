Four, three, two

Let's count it off one
Now we gon' show you all to have fun
Get dressed and hit the club about two
Ima order me a Henny and a brew
And Ima grab two girls or maybe three
Now get on the dancefloor with me
We wanna know what you came for
I wanna see you get it on the floor
Now we gon' push out about five
I'm feeling your buzz and beehive
Now lets go get some breakfast at six
Out in front of the diner, we taking pics
And I could see the red eye, it's like seven
Got the engine in the Tahoe revving
Pick up the check and bounce about eight
Now it's time to put you up on the plate
Honey, I'll be the 6, you'll be the 9
I gotta have you again, you too fine
Girl, you better than 9, you're like dime
On a beautiful scale, you get a ten
Because you don't take up with all men
You got me lost in time, it's 11:30
And your body's like heaven, it's so curvy
So just one more time, you assume
So we can both be asleep by noon

[Hook: Jon B]
What are you gonna do today? Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now
Oh yeah

[BlaKKazz K.K.]
I like your cinnamon buns dipped in Deréon
Feeling the jeans just busting the seams
Make the K fiend, but what ya game like?
Looking at you baby, I see ya frame right
We on the floor with the girls off tequila
Sexy, independent, party going divas
That like to drop it low, stop and go
Push back that ass, girl don't stop that show
Party hard, make a toast
By the end of the night doing the most
I'm checking out ya pedicure package, ya well-managed
You bilingual? I hit you with the Spanish
(¡Soy Culo a Negro, me dicen mandigo, con la culebra grande)
Yeah, I'm international, now you know
Loving the black and brown, I do it all

[Jon B and DJ Quik]
What are you gonna do today? (Yeah K)
Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds (They gotta call they travel agent for this one)
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping (Yea)
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now

[DJ Quik]
Now the Hollywood glitz and glamour
That's just one aspect, Still pack your camera
Cause we got projects, just like Atlanta
But you might get seasick, so bring Mylanta
Cause we got marinas and yachts and big mansions
And bubbly pouring on the patio I'm dancing
I kick it with Prince, but his house he was jamming
Plus I didn't have to fly out to Minneapolis
It's the metropolis, it's where they topless
It's where we party in the evening where the cops is
House of Blues day, Key Club Tuesday
Sunset cracking a lot harder than where you stay
They come from the I.E., they coming from Sandberg
They coming from Phoenix and Las Vegas where the sand burns
They coming from 'Frisco, they coming from O-HI
They coming from Memphis and Detroit and NY
But all of 'em fly

[Jon B]
What are you gonna do today? Let me fly you to LA
Where the sun never hides behind the clouds
You peep the shore line when you landed, on the 405 now dipping
Whatever's on your mind is what we gon' do now
Oh yeah
What we gonna do now, babe, is
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, baby party
Party, party, party, we gon' party

Whoa, whoa-whoa yeah ye-yeah-yeah
