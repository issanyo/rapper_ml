[Intro]
Why, this beat is automatic
It’s systematic
It’s hydromatic
And I’m hydromatic

[Verse 1: Gift Reynolds]
And I’m Gift Reynolds, nigga, known to go hard
Detroit native who be pistol packin’
No straps at all when I get to rappin’
Hope I kill this beat like six pistols clappin’
And flatline every show, get to catch it
Lights, cameras, action – necks be snappin’
When that band be smashin’ and that DJ scratchin’
Me part of the team, yeah, that’s shit’s asthmatic
And Quik on anything, history happens on that (Hydromatic)
Got the clubs in a frenzy, system blastin’
And what you askin’—is that my passion?
Me mind-fuckin’ the fans, yeah, that’s shit’s orgasmic
So systematic, automatic
Yeah, that chick so easy, let me pass it—go!

[Chorus: Jon B]
On and on, and on it goes
And on and on, Quik with this original
On and on, and on it goes
You can’t walk before you crawl
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Tried to do us like Trading Places, we ain’t in the movies
Put you in an alley dumpster, mouth full of roofies
Ants on your eyebrows, you can’t even itch ‘em
Incisions from your autopsy, they don’t even stitch ‘em
A pimp, ho, with the tempo, no clap, no snare
It’s DJ Quik and Jon B, and that’s not fair
Ladies get dramatic whenever we get near
You rockin’ two Bluetooths and still can’t hear
This is (D-J-Q [What?] U-I-K [And?] J-O-N-B)

[Verse 3: Jon B]
I’m a goose hunter in the winter
You a little bird, you about to be my dinner—that’s my word
Chomp up with the Buck shot, I bump ‘Pac
When we’re loungin’ at the truck stop, it don’t stop ‘til it’s…

[Chorus: Jon B]
On and on, and on it goes
And on and on, Quik with this original
On and on, and on it goes
You can’t walk before you crawl
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original

Hydromatic…it’s hydromatic (Repeat until end)

[Chorus: Jon B]
On and on, and on it goes
And on and on, Quik with this original
On and on, and on it goes
You can’t walk before you crawl
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original
On and on, and on it goes
On and on, this is the original
