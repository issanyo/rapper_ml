[Verse 1]
Hungry like I want money—follow me, baby
Know the coochie’s like honey—swallow it, baby
Niggas really wanna get ya, show me the rules
‘Cause you got me going, baby, I’m losing my cool
Is it really what I want, or more than I need?
I can make it right, baby, just follow the speed
I know you a freak, I got you up in the suite
I got Q on the beat, I want you in the sheets
Don’t be playin’ with me, you can play with yourself
Livin’, lovin’, and wealth, 30 years on the belt
Shit, I’ll be a gentleman, at least once
Or it’s just my imagination and these blunts
Sweet enough to eat a lot (come on, baby)
Do it ‘til you’re satisfied (you know I am)
She can make a nigga high
Baby, tattoo “AMG” on your thigh
Come on…

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody do what you do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)
Tell me what you want me to do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)

[Verse 2]
Baby wanna hit the coach, not the bag
Throw her in a drop coupe, not the Jag
Made it, livin’ lovely, poppin’ bubbly
Home in the country where the money be
I love it when she do her thing
Damn near got me looking for a ring
But when I want what I want she gives me what I gotta get
Pimp to the lip and hip
Slippery as a ship, hit the coochie in the whip
She called me a dog, I called her a…(no, no)
Pretty toes made me buy her the rose
She was coming out her clothes, and I’m tryna drive slow
I couldn’t say no—who would I be then?
My only wish is if she had a twin
Swervin’ on the 405, baby
Do it ‘til you’re satisfied, baby

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody do what you do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)
Tell me what you want me to do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)

[Interlude]
Yeah, now, what you like baby?
(Do it ‘til you’re satisfied) Everything?

[Verse 3]
My baby’s soft like mink all covered in pink
My favorite drink, I can’t even think
She knows other hoes wanna be in the mix
I’m just playin’ with the pricks, baby, show me your…
I know you got your own dough, Benz four-door
When we get together, ride me like a rodeo
Check the portfolio…oh
Do it to your soul, we can make a video
Other niggas want a taste, but you crack they face
Wishin’ they was huggin’ on your waist
With you I could never lose
You make me wanna put mirrors on my shoes
I gotta see it

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody do what you do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)
Tell me what you want me to do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)

Can’t nobody do what you do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)
Tell me what you want me to do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)

Can’t nobody do what you do (perfection)
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with you (perfection)
Every time I look in your eye (perfection)
Girl, you got me hypnotized (perfection)
Tell me what you want me to do
