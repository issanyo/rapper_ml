Mr. Troutman, rest in peace, we love you

More bounce to the ounce, more bounce to the ounce

Groove for you
I want to play a groove for you [4x]

Will you let me play for you?
I want to play, I want to play a groove for you

Groove for you
I want to play a groove for you [4x]

Even though it hurts me so, I promise, I promise
To keep the talkbox alive
For you, for you, for you
Mr. Troutman

I want to play a groove for you [8x]
