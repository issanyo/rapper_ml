[Soulja Slim]

I'm that nigga they call Soulja Slim so I gotta murder them
All finna stop my ball crawl never no more down falls
Respect my call i'm a true tank dog all about puttin bodies in morgues
Stall never do that when it come time to for me to break em off
Fuck the laws  up in my projects niggas lettin loose at the cops
In the wild magnolia we got it on lockdown surrounded by nothin but souljas
??? with the roof see young truce? mobbin? thats 187 proof
Trigger finger itchin til the let loose
On any nigga feelin he die hard like bruce
We murdered out ain't no secret you done heard about the dirty south
Bounce it war war 2 shit fuck around get yo wig split in the NO
Nigga blow you up n make shit like accidental
Wasn't nothhin but a tourist brothers had through the ghetto
In a rental from south central

Shots gotta let loose shots shot shots gotta let loose shots
