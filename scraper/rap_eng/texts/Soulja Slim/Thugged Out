What's up baby
No Limits finest
Iberville baby
I'm thugged
Throw up your henessy bottle
Fuck with breath with me
We thugged out

[Verse One: Krazy]
???  tank when I ride, Ibervill
Represent my breeders, till the day I'm killed
Pass that weed, let me take a puff
In the project, slangin' out my cut
I got that work, If you need a hit
I got them ounces, if you need a fit
In the club can I freak
Thuggin up in public
You know she had to speak
Hey seaxy, I'm headed down town
Then she grabed the ball
And started tearing it down
I don't know whut cha been told
Down town soldiers leave your coochy swole

[Hook: Krazy]
I be thugged out, everytime you see me
I be thugged out, in the projects
I be thugged out, with my tank gold
I be thugged out, when I'm down town
I be thugged out, when I'm up town
I be thugged out, when sippin henessy
I be thugged out, when I'm in the club
I be thugged out
You know what eles I did

[Verse Two: Krazy]
See I thug with my figgas
Representin' hard heads
Me and my breather like to ball till we fall dead
Thugged out with Soulja Slim
Magnolia's kingpin
Fresh up out the pin
Homie bout to do this thang again
See there ain't no stopping me
The tank is on the raise again
Get up out my way I'll be bustin' with my mack 10
Let me in yo' door playa when I come messed up
If you trust your family you best give yo stash up
Ain't know body stopping me
You know I got that chopper cocked
Breather from New Orleans still thuggin like Pac
Down town killah, load that kay

[Hook: Krazy]
