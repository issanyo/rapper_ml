[Hook]
I'm screaming hollering "Let it go"
I'm going through a thing
You might see me in the metro
Feel my pain
Everyday is a rainy day
Sunny day, please come and dry this rain away
Take this pain away

[Verse 1]
Nigga won't break me off a few of them thangs, I just come home
The devil in my ear making it clear that all this slang
[?] the game has some consequences
Being locked up and thrown away or get blown away
Man I could see
Respect my mouth about what I say, low down dirty south where I stay
[?] where I lay my head
And i been through way more worse shit than what I said, 9-8
Had me to demonstrate your bitch ass something
Keep thinking that I'm from Uptown that I love stunting
Snoop gave me a sweet connection overseas
With blocks of heroin like a mountain of cheese
Let me [?] cause these [?] might be listening
Already feel like they watching me, want to put a bullet out their Glock in me
Stopping me, I think not
You ain't never seen a nigga with a [?]

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I been living life on life's terms
With more money, more problems
I work hard and I earn
I still feel like ain't no way I can turn
If I make a right or a left, I still be getting burned
Some like a rock [?] while a crackhead hitting
While it's good, you think I ain't gon be getting it? You got me fucked up
Cause I'm screaming "Let it go"
If the money coming in, let it flow
Really though, niggas still move coke
But it's still about the [?]
I smoke, keep moving [?]  feel it blow
Puff puff pass that shit cause I smoke doja
That's the only way I keep my composure
Ducking Angola, y'all feel that
I done [?] from '95, momma don't cry
I'm a soulja, I was born to die
When I'm gone, you the only soulja
[?] you brought me in
[?]
[?] camouflage
I'm a Soulja!
