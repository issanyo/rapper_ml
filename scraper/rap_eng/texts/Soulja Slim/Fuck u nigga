[Lil Real One]
Bitch I'ma cut throat nigga, hoe we buckin I made ya
My neighborhood don't like me cuz they know I'ma gangsta
They love to call enforcement bout my bad behavior
Cuz I'm quick to grab that shotti and go find my neighbor
Used to flip them ghetto hoes but now I feel like a playa
Man this bone shit done gave a nigga powerful flavor
We'll steal up off yo tank, if you don't get out I'll make ya
Fuck No Limit you owe my nigga some paper
Cut Throat Committee, official we screamin ya bone grizzle
If ya meet this chrome nickel, make ya dome dome wiggle
Its blisterin cold, ya body frozen icicle
Got some shit on ya nose, you prolly got ya wife wit ya, nigga

Then I'ma show you how I turn into a hype nigga, overnight nigga
Beat a bitch over his head wit a pipe a slice and dice him
Wit a knife I let him know that'll it'll be cut throat for life
