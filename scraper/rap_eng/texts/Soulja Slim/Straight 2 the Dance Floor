Real niggas in the back here's whatcha do
Grab a bitch, grab a gat & raise the roof
An if a nigga soulja hatin' on ya let 'em go
An if this ho is kinda diggin' on ya let her blow
Bust nuts like we bust gats
You niggas better watch ya dome fore' we bust dat
Cut Thraot Comitty to the bone & we don't play
Hundred round drum cocked makin' headway, whodi
Bitch nigga get somewhere
Fore' this thang go off & you get hit somewhere
Don't check me check dat ho, she chose
Fore' she get yo chest pumped fulla bullet holes

[12 O'Klock]
Look ma I find it hard to let you walk by
I know you sick of these lame niggas that talk fly
Probaly sayin' I'm ghetto because I spark lye
Tryna take ya from the burbs to the darkside
You wanna ride we can slide in the Expedition
Play ya cards right & you can be the next to glisten
Before we bounce make sure to tell yuor ex to listen
When in the Marriott tryna find ya best postition
You got me lost the way ya back it up & wobble on it
Ma I'm willin' to put up 5 & my bible on it
Catch in the game but it'll change if I get up on it
Beat that thang up like me & you was boxing opponents
Gettin' paid cause you in for a long night
Don't be ashamed cause boo you put on a strong fight
But game is game & 12 O' Klock don't make no promises that he can't keep
An ain't a corner darker enough to were we can't creep

[Hook]

[Damien]
