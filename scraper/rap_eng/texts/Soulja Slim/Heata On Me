[Verse 1: Soulja Slim]
Deep down in that south nigga way way under
That nigga Soulja Slim had shit poppin one summer
I'm pushing geezy hummer and he pushing my lac
This some throwback shit ya'll don't know what's happening
Niggas selling they soul for a meal ticket
I been hurting, I keep working and I will get it
I'ma keep it real with it
Had a Archie Manning saints throwback on in a fitted
And some black Reeboks tennis
You already know I got on some black girbauds
With a gun that'll cook a nigga like he fell on the stove
I'ma O.G. lil daddy I still ride with my heat
But I'm coming closer with God asking him to forgive me
Hear me out nigga, feel my pain its all real
These lil boys slanging that iron but they ain't got no kills
Betta stay the fuck from round me with that wild gun firing
They ain't stepping on my back I'm coming out of retirement

[Hook x4]
I keep that motherfucking heata on me
That's why no nigga don't come fucking with me

[Verse 2: B.G.]
I was raised by killers and jackers on the block
Had me holding they macs and nines while I sold rocks
I watched observed and learned
Made 13 hopped off the porch felt it was my turn
First thing I did was got a burner
I knew them old niggas would test me cause I was a young earner
Uptown is dangerous ground niggas get plucked
You know how slim and gizzle roll the streets made us
We get in beef k's bust
We making a statement if you owe then you better pay us
Fuck around ya people taped up
You know this chopper city shit real you could get ya throat cut
My niggas in the hood doped up
Ready to bang out with ATF whoever we don't give a fuck
Shop stay open we never close
I shouldn't have to tell ya you know how it goes

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
You fucking with this nigga here
I'm fucking with this nigga too
A nigga have no fucking heart
You know what my trigger do
Rat tat tat a ta ta mane
Make that nigga scatter mane
I'm two thousand big trigger mane
Plus he ain't change
Who who I'm talking to you
Too many niggas ratting now so I only fuck with a few
Make sure I feed that nigga with a long handle spoon
Cause my lil platoon be home soon
I don't fuck with these niggas they just trying to get on
It take way more than screaming out cutthroat to the bone
Shit I'm cutthroat to the bone and that's a actual fact
I been committed involuntary and it came like that
So don't be looking crazy frowning up like you don't know me
You heard my fucking accent you heard me holla woodie
I'ma down south third ward magnolia die hard
Cutthroat to the bone gristle
I ain't never scared boy

[Hook x4]
