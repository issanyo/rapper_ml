[Mac]

Say Slim, look

[Soulja Slim]

What's happenin wootay

[Mac]

We goin take this here all the way from the Magnolia
Across Clayborne

[Soulja Slim]

Do it like that

[Mac]

Ya heard me

[Soulja Slim]

Do it

[Chorus]

Can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall
Can I ball niggas or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall

[Mac--Verse 1]

To make this million I'm bound to left uptown to go get it
Once I get it, I'm a split it with those who I'm commited
Like who, my nigga Wop, my girl Storm and the rest of my click
Everybody else be on some oh you ballin now (you ballin now)
Since you play me closer, I'm a get the toast, oh mark my word
Fuck em, fuck em if they don't know what's happen my rap
If a nigga know me, he don't know me no more
Cause I don't hang in the same streets no more, I gotta condo
I lay low, chill, stay away from shit that get niggas killed
Call me fake then my niggas will say that's trill
Check it, funny high hoes be calling me jiggy now
Cause I gotta little jingle, mingle with the finest and sport diamonds
When I was broke I was skinny and full of shit
Now it ain't nothin for me to pull a bitch
I scratch off and I hear them hoes say he did that
Every bitch I fuck be saying I'm tryin to have your kid Mac
I ain't with that

[Chorus]

Can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall
Can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall

[Soulja Slim]

I'm a try my best not to let these niggas bring me out there
They know you beefing with the ????, and them niggas don't care
Who they kill, and tryin to be a millionare on the real
But I can't a from with that foolishness so I'm a chill
And just pass through the projects that I used to roam in
Tote the black and the steel chrome and holler at trill
Niggas like Jim Stone and
No more hangin, no more slangin pearls and crack pieces
No more fucking dog bitches carryin deadly deseases
They burn your dick off, givin you aids through the rubber
I had to settle down with a boss bitch and now that's my lover
She down for a nigga
And when the situation gets heavy she lets loose rounds for a nigga
And if I don't come home she'll come blood hound for a nigga
That's the type of bitch I need, no drink, no smoke, no weed
Hoes label me a hot boy cause I just come home and I don't get D'd
But I'm a boss baby, I like to floss baby
Can I ball yall, can I ball

[Chorus]

Now can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall
Can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall

[Mac--Verse 2]

Now Soulja Slim, my nigga, my nerve, my partner, my wootay
My round
My ace, my dog, I was down even when you was on that brown
You camoflauged uptown that was some shit to see
So when they locked you up I continue the legacy
Now all these niggas claiming Soulja is you bout that ball
Would you die for me if a nigga pull up in that ontrol car
I think you niggas sitting around waiting on my fall
Let a nigga ball, nigga let a nigga ball

[Chorus]

Can I ball yall or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck all yall, if yall was waiting on my fall
Can I ball niggas or do they wanna see me crawl
Man fuck yall niggas, if yall was waiting on my fall
Ya heard me, woah

[Soulja Slim]

Now yall understand
Now you understand
Macadon and Soulja Slim
In the process of B-O-O-Cing, ballin out of control

[Mac]

Bleeding out of control nigga

[Soulja Slim]

[Mac]

So uh look, I'm a tell these niggas like this here
We bout to go get these motherfuckin rolexes shined up nigga
And go get our chrome shined up
