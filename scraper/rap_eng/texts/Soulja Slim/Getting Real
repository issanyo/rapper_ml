[Intro]
Yeah, haha
My nigga Soulja Slim in this bitch
(Fiend in this bitch)
[?] a soulja now, fuck that
We going to war, nigga
(Niggas tryna be you, dog)
We bring it
(Niggas can't fucking hang)
How we singing, this shit's real
(Shit's about to get hot in this bitch)
Niggas better guard their grill
Let these motherfuckers know what the deal is
(Wake the fuck up)

[Verse 1]
Y'all can't compare me with no nigga you know
[?] hit the floor when you hear my flow, woe
It's not the realest shit I ever wrote
That [?] I ever smoke around niggas, that's cut throat
Gotta be on my P's and Q's cause niggas hatin'
Niggas that I used to fuck with, don't wanna see me make it
Rapping is my occupation, respect that
I left the game where it's at but if I want to, I can go back
But no, I can't be around no dope
Flashbacks to bad habits doing bad and selling soap
Bricks all in my throat, caked that coke up my nose
When I can make money, fuck hoes just by getting a couple of blows
And stay in condos and slam luxury doors
Everything got [?] and paid for
Won't have it no other way, another day another baller
Shot caller, big pistol [?] with back against the wall
Shit, [?] put that all up on [?] daughter
Fuck with this No Limit shit, you put me off in that water
Shit, I used to snort a quarter, but now I only smoke blunts
Cause I get on that other level and don't know my do's and dont's
Shit's getting real

[Hook]
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause if you fake, you can't feel we real
Shit's getting real
Shit's getting real, you better guard your grill
Cause real niggas, can feel what we feel
Shit's getting real

[Verse 2: Fiend]
[?]
I'm known as dangerous so Fiend became a name for this
[?] for this, so I can get the change for this
[?] executive [?]
I got a little something put you on the map
From the attack, villains stacking
[?]
Remove the keys of the night
[?]
Had weed on that pipe instead of that white with a fight
Now you're dealing with my dog that don't bark when they bite
[?] get it right
And remember, it ain't personal
And every single sick [?] believe me was rehearsable
Out [?]
[?] better put some dirt in you
Hoping that [?] walk in with the chills
Get the money and [?]
Trying to get paid for a kill
Releasing these really reals
Fiend and [?], No Limits navy seal

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Time to watch them niggas
Got to hit the streets again
Got a wake up call y'all, so I'm [?]
Housed in, it's all about this gangsta shit
See the bitch ride a bitch
Spank the bitch [?]
Up early in the morning, first [?] hit the block
I got a pot full of rocks with two fat ass Glocks
[?] see these niggas peeping me out
[?] window blowing weed out
[?] niggas all G'd out
So I up these bitches
Niggas better count every blessing
[?] debt
Well they can't pass me, I got [?]
[?] everyday, ain't nothing gonna change
Still watching them niggas lose their brain over a ho ass game
The more I change, I beat em
[?] when I see them
[?] see the heater
I'm hitting black lines after I see them

[Hook]
