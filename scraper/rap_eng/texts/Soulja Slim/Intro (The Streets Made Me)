[Talking]
What the fuck I was told 1998, 2001
On and on you know how I do it
It don't stop it don't stop
Look Look Look

[Soulja Slim]
Shit's real I'ma tell you this off tops
All my niggas from the Six Code got Glocks
We killers dog, hold sixty dog
On the reala dog, put yo head on the permanent pillow dog
Spit shit raw shit wash shit you want that get that
Get back my dogs bout War, smoke niggas like Humps
Smoke niggas like Gar you don't want to se us in that tinted car
Jumpin' out that bitch screamin' out Aw Aw
With K's n shit The Streets Made Me bitch
So don't ever try to play this shit
Like it's cool I'm a fuckin' fool on the low
Don't ever check a real nigga check a hoe
I'm tellin' ya they gone be smellin' ya
Under the Magnolia I'm a Soldier

[Chorus]
From what I was told again I'm a blow again
Fuck with these hoes again get exposed again
Mystikal Im'a try to duck and dodge the pin
Never goin' back to the hole they threw me in
From what I was told

2001 you know The Streets Made Me
I got love for the streets
