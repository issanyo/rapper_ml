[Intro]

[Hook]
Smoking on that best shit
That out west shit
Some of that hurt your chest shit
When you test

[Verse 1]
Look I'm going my ass back to Cali, better believe
When Snoop D-O-double G [?] me two for three
That's that fire, straight up head banger
I don't do nothing but take it like a
They say that shit substitute mine
Used to be dope habbit, if it is
Not a day go bye cause I gots to have it
You can't tell me I ain't balling dog
When you see me, [?] living in New Orleans dog
Run game quick on an out of towner
[?] quarter pounder, regular shit
Old lame ass, good boy
My projects ain't nothing like your hood, boy
So knock on wood, boy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
We riding in a rental car, low key
Me and Trinity heading toward the East with two freaks
Bitch, we going to LaQuinta Inn, I'm VIP
When you finish smoking [?] suck me to sleep
Now I don't wanna fuck tonight, pussy a'ight
It's just something about that mouth got a nigga [?]
But she'll never know I'm whipped she know I'm psyched
Cause I get my dick sucked every other night
That's all I need is some best west shit
And two [?] bitch in love with the dick
I want me a true bitch, true player of the year
Dick thrower, cut throater, best west smoker
