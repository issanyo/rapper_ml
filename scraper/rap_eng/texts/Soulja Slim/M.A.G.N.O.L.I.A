[Soulja Slim talking]
The streets made me, you know they did, 6th Street, Magnolia Street, c'mon
M...A...G...N...O..L, I, A, thats the home where the souljas stay

[Hook-2x]
You niggas claim to be a soulja, but you souljas ain't no souljas
I told ya and I showed ya, I'm a soulja for life
Now what you hear is what you get, from a nigga like me
Uncut, raw shit, all I know is the streets

[Soulja Slim]
I got these niggas wearing soulja reeboks and soulja rags
I had these niggas off the porch in '94, snortin' powder bags
Magnolia Slim underground, Soulja Slim to the world
It's all the same, don't get it twisted, still uncut and explicit
Uptown's where I'm listed, look me up in the 3rd Ward
You might find me on the Parkway between Dourgenois and Broad
Smokin' herb, by the curb, but I ain't gone chill for too long though
Cause on that there block, them white folks be hot
Shoot up to wards Claybourne, make a left cut through Exon
Now I'm on Willow Street, the spot where the killers be
That's where I layed my head for years, I'm a representa
And I ain't talkin' bout this rap shit, nigga respect it or I'll send ya

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim]
I'm soulja this, I'm soulja that, nigga what, I played the halls
Ran through the cut, 6 Co. fa'sho, The Circle, the killin' field
Where the killers chill, on the real, that been my spot since I was lil'
I can't tell these d's to chill, since Shorty Mike got killed
Open wound still soaked, it's gone heal
I run with trill niggas, we don't take no shit
If you got it, you better hide it, I still pull off robberies
Ain't a damn thing gravy, ain't a damn thing sweet
My beef they beef, they beef my beef
6 Co. nigga, 6 Co., Cut Throat nigga, screamin' Cut Throat

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim]
I'm screamin' I'm a soulja cause I mean it nigga
From my black soulja reeboks to my beanie nigga
I soulja walk and talk crazy to these bitch niggas
Its in my blood, what the fuck, I'mma blast that trigga
What you forgot, with the murder charge in '96
Without no evidence, I ain't even do the shit, not guilty
You niggas should've been killed me
I done came up, me and my souljas bout to fuck the game up, be cool
M...A...G...N...O..L, I, A, thats the home where the souljas stay

[Hook-2x]

[Soulja Slim talking]
Cut Throat Comitty, the streets made me, the streets made me
Motherfuckers better know
