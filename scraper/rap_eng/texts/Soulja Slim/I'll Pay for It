[Soulja Slim]
Oh shit, (um, um), oh shit(um, um), oh shit(um, um)

[Verse 1]
Look I like 'em with a small waist and nice hips
So when I'm hittin from the back I get a nice grip
I be sweatin like a dog and I might slip
So with the right hips I get a tight vise grip
I got that work and I just come from doin time again
You can't slip you see the line that they standin in
Don't trip I got enough of dick for all of ya'll
They say that I'm a dog right after I knock 'em off
She mad at me tryna get me out some out money
You gets nothin from me you gon' be broke around the bar this Sunday
Believe that, you gon' see that
I'm a thug ain't no love for the club rats
Yeah I told you I was breakin bread
But breakin bread to a limit you heard what I said
I ain't stutter I'm a cheeky ass motherfucker
If you a hustler let me see you work them booty muscles
Get jiggy wit it

[Hook 2x]
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
If I want it, if I want it
If I want it, if I want it

[Verse 2]
I'mma leave some passion marks on fire red
Suck on her neck like a vamp when we in that bed
I'm like 'Jada' I stopped 'kissin' a long time ago
I'mma player and I don't put nothing past a ho
Move on it slow but I move fast when I want that ass
Then break camp like a rockhead done stole the stash
I'mma holla. I got Caramel waiting on me, Red hating on me
She think I really give a fuck that she skating on me
What you ain't heard the news? All of 'em confused
For everyone that I lose I bounce back with two
You in love with me? Yeah I'm in love with you
Not mentally but physically and what ya mouth do
Yeah that booty loose, like a rubber band
I ain't make it like that, that was that other man
I just start hitting it a few weeks ago
If you a pro let me see you make that thing show

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me see you walk with it, make her mad
She hating on you cause she ain't working with too much ass
I'm waiting on you to make me and my dawg proud of you
Throw that ass this way I got a few dollars for you
I'm hollering for you I got three 50's and eight 20's
I'll give you these three 50's if you rolling with me
The rest going on a motherfucking hotel
Soulja Slim got that work, you can go tell
I let my dawgs hear the screaming on the Nextel
I'm a motherfucking dog, send me to hell
I fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck all (I'ma dog like that)
I'm a motherfucking dog like that (just like that)

[Hook]
