[Souljah Slim]
Out to get
Dirty
With them dogs
Underhouse
All the time Souljah Slim be into no doubt
Niggas
Check
With 'em never ever disrespect
Protect yo neck
Cause them CutThroats and them bullets
I see ya watch me
Try to copy
Picked up my slang
Now down 2 close range
Puttin them thangs
All I do is hang
Me touch uh-huh
You expire
Want some fire?
Got a Brigade for yo click if you gon' riot
You dead
But now I've been tryin to chill from splittin wigs
Tryin to do my rap thang and take care of my kids
I know you niggas friendly
But caps for the goasts
But some get goasts
Before you get roast
Like some beef
Cheek
[?]
Back me
Blast me
It's hard 2 black
It's some harmful black
Got a map
For 1 in the chamber
And a clip in my pocket
You think I'm trippin?
Watch how quick
I start to clippin
Just cause I'm Ahre Ahre don't mean I'm slippin

[Chorus: x2]
Watch these niggas
And watch these bitches

Cause these niggas and and these bitches show 'nuff stop killas
WooTay
WooTay

I'm Frustrated
Cause Souljah Slim is being Souljah hated
By so many
Niggas that aren't worth a fuckin penny
Don't be no Hater
There's no need for Violence This Albums
Shit's Real
We'll bully all the madness
Steal
What u can feel
You know the deal
Souljah Fo Life
You Got it right
Coming from the Darkside
When I bring niggas with they bite
So getcha own
Cause I'll be sittin by my phone
I'll be waitin
For you rappers with all your motherfuckin fakin
Fakin
Hold 'em out by the 2s of [?]
"WooTay"
There ain't no need
For yo beggin me please
You can scream and holler til u lose your voice
It was your choice for me to take ya
You never heard what I do to haters
Don't ask me what the Darkside is all about
All you need to know is that it's located in the Dirty south
How come the Business ain't coming back into the light
Likewise
You been invited at the same time

[Chorus: x2]
Watch these niggas
And watch these bitches
WooTay
WooTay
Cause these niggas and and these bitches show 'nuff stop killas
WooTay
WooTay

Y'all beenkeeps start hittin
Y'all worryed this nigga

That ain't got 6 fix
Fuckin with these TRU niggas'll make ya money out the asshole
Fuckin right
Hittin No Limit
Like Pac hit that room
I kno you heard me on the radio
WooTay

And off the ShowRoom Floor

[Chorus: x2]
Watch these niggas
