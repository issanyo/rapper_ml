[Verse 1]
(So Slim, do you have anything to say to the people?)
I'm a mothafuckin' Fool, and you, test my nuts
Not knowin', in guns I trust, and bust and put gats in the dust
You wanted some murder shit, well murder shit is what ya gettin'
I'm verbally spittin', got these niggas scared and shittin'
You fuckin' with the right one, soulja fo life one
Ain't no mothafucka like em, Where he at, show em to me
And I'm gonna strike em and bite em
And swallow em, for trying to be a follower
My deadly venom instantly kills em like a cobra
Leave it up to Magnolia To shut em down and sow it up
Dom P being toasted up break down sticky and roll it up
And smoke it up with enemies Claim to be friends with me
The whole while they into me When shit don't make sense to me
Whodi got a bently, and whodi got a jag
Whodi got a lot of shit that Soulja Slim never had
But, I don't get mad and start hatin, cuz that's bitch shit
If it wasn't for incarceration, I'd a been rich

[Hook]
I'm a fool
And I'm one of em, who likes to talk about what I'm about
Straight up tell ya to ya face what I'm gonna do
I'm a fool
These niggas fool hoggin, and ho hoggin
Drinkin' that hatorade, they don't wanna see me ballin'
I'm a fool
They can't stop me, they hoes jock me
How u luv that, baller block that
I'm a fool
I can hear em sayin it now
That's a fool there, a fool there

[Verse 2]
(knocks on the door)

Who's there?, it's me dog, me?
Where the fuck you was at when I was off in the penetentiary
When I was outta sight and outta mind
With only a handful of soldiers by my side
Rest of my so called niggas was jive
But I ain't gonna say no names, cuz they know who they be
So if you thinkin' I'm talkin' bout you, Fuck You
Cuz lately, I been feelin' since these niggas tryin' soulja hate me
That they wanna duct tape me
And knock me off, and drop me off, in the Nolia
But I'm shell shocked, clutchin' my Glock, bitch I'm a soldier
Pay yo round n them some change to come and get me
And I'm gonna be waitin' on em by myself with my pistols with me
Ain't nann nigga gon' ride, like I'm gon' ride for me
And ain't nann nigga gon die, like I'm gon' die for me
Believe that, I'm 100% real when ya look me up and down
You can see that, come at me and miss, and I'll be back
To touch somethin', hit somethin' and split somethin'
Quit stunnin', ya'll niggas ain't killin' nuttin'

[Hook]
I'm a fool
I been there, done that shit
When I'm off in that zone, nigga, tell me run that shit
I'm a fool
Angola bound, uptown
Skinny ass nigga weighin' a hundred somethin' pounds
I'm a fool
I represents what I say
Ain't no fuckin game here, ain't no instant replay
I'm a fool
I hear em sayin it now, that's a fool there, a fool there

[Verse 3]
(Slim, do you have anything to say to the haters who say you can't
Make it on the outside?)
Remember this old sayin' a wise man change A fool will stay the same
Fuck it, blame it on the game cuz its raining acid
Will I spend my life in a cell block or in a casket
Or will I get old and get my groove back like Angela Basset
Only time will tell, but until then I'll be stackin' my mail
Off my album album sells, Magnolia wear dwells
I love them bricks, I love the ghetto hoes
Cuz they gon' show ya what they workin' with
A lot of my little dogs, still be gettin' loaded
Walkin' around the project with the pistol out, talkin' swollen
Whodi don't give a fuck, cuz they dilly got em gone
Bout that foolishness, and gon' jack somethin' with they jones
They remind me of me, old Magnolia Slim
You can break ya ass off in this sewer water tryin' to swim
It's polluted, I'm foolish
