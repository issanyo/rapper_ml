[Verse 1: B.G.]
B. Gizzle is a hot girl dream
Got 'em nationwide like a football team
Keisha my New Orleans Saint
'Cause she break me off when them other hoes ain't!
Flip it up, got me a Florida Redskin
She stingy with ass, just let me put the head in!
Shoot to the East Coast, hit up my New York Jet
She take it like a Giant once I get the pussy wet
I double back, you know I got a St. Louis Ram
I'm up there all the time, 'cause she breaking off Pam
Can't forget my Chi-Town Bear
My Detroit Lion a fool, I stays up there
Next order, me, I got a Mississippi Charger
Take a ride all the time, that mountain like water
And I had me an Oakland Raider
She ain't act right, so I had to shake her
And she was screaming

[Hook: Soulja Slim]
"My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
She couldn't take dick from the back (From the back)
It don't stop, turn over on your back
I had her screaming "My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
She couldn't take dick from the back (From the back)
It don't stop, turn over on your back!

[Verse 2: Soulja Slim]
Where the Angels and the Biancas at?
Candy, Darlene and Elaine can take it from the back (Yeah)
Felicia and Ginger, goddamn, I hate it when I can't remember
Whatever, whatever, I'mma call that bitch Heather
Isha and Jarissa, can't forget about Krystal
She only give me skull because I'm working with a missle
Now vouch for me, yeah, vouch for me
And after that, put my dick back in your mouth for me
Scream "Ouch!" for me, you know my worth
If you can't take dick, don't stand in line first
I need mines with a small waist and nice hips
Independent, good credit that could buy me a whip
I'll pay for it, I'll pay for it
And if I go to jail, I'll bet she'll wait for it
She'll have that pussy and shake for it
I'm a dick thrower, and when she back I'll have her screaming

[Hook: Soulja Slim]
"My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
She couldn't take dick from the back (From the back)
It don't stop, turn over on your back
I had her screaming "My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
She couldn't take dick from the back (From the back)
It don't stop, turn over on your back!

[Verse 3: B.G.]
I already know what my pickle do
I hit and leave, you be calling, saying "I'm missing you!"
That's how it be, 'cause when I slang it, I slang it right
If I'mma bring it to you, trust me, I'mma bring it right!
Girl, if I hit you, I dick-whip you
I'mma have to call the police to come and get you
If they arrest you, that's on you
I ain't coming to bring you out, I'll call your mom, too!
If you hit me, you got that
You showing me that it's good and you like that
I won't fight back, 'cause you want that
Go put the Beyonce in and bump that!
Not "Baby Boy," "Me, Myself and I,"
You can charge it to the game, 'cause I gotta ride
I'mma holla at you, I'll see you later
Matter of fact, I'll call you if I need a favor!

[Hook: Soulja Slim]
I had her screaming "My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
She couldn't take dick from the back (From the back)
It don't stop, turn over on your back
I had her screaming "My neck (My neck)
And my back (My back)!"
I throw that dick like that (Like that)
