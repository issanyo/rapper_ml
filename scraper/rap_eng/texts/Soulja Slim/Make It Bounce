[Intro]
As soon as you thought it was over, it just started
Ain't no party like a Magnolia party
Now bounce baby, make it bounce
Twerk that, twerk that back
Baby act bad, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I see what you doing there, swinging that ass
I see what you doing there, swinging that ass

Twerk that, twerk that back
Baby act bad, yeah yeah yeah yeah

Bounce shit up in New Orleans
Even know I switched the game, I still know what they like
They want that *bang bang bang* and (all night)
So they can catch the ground, hold it down, throw that big old ass around
I ain't saying it cause I'm up there but [?] working out uptown

Making it clap with the G string all in their crack
Back it up then don't do it like that
Catch the wall, break it off

And it's wobbling like [?] booties do
