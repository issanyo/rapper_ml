[Intro]
Niggas steady tryna figure me out
Wanna know if I run real shit
Is I'm a real nigga
Imma tell you what the fuck I'm bout...

[Verse 1]
I’m New Orleans, I’m the murder rate in 1994
I’m the quarter that your score, snort it up and want more
I’m that nigga real niggas love and fake niggas hate
I’m that nigga that went Gold in 98 while I was up state
No promotion at all, the streets ‘gon hear it
Your dead homie was the one posting studio lyrics
I’m out here everyday posted up in the hallway
Just ten feet away my AK lies in the grass
Next time I bust a nigga ass I’m a leave my mark
Bust his head, cut his throat, and take his heart
You don’t have to start some shit it’s gon’ be some shit
I'm a quick draw mcgraw Nigga
Make the first one hit
And the first one is the worst one
I believe in one shot, one kill... get the picture?
I’m America beefing with Afghanistan
They done tore the 'Nolia down, it ain’t nothing but dry land

[Hook x2]
I’m Soulja this, Soulja that
Bitch nigga what
I played the halls, ran through the cuts
6th court fa sho , the circle, the killing field where the killers chill
On the real, that been my spot since I was lil

[Verse 2]
I’m Glenn Ness
I’m Tim Scully
I’m Al Brognac
I’m that nigga showed you niggas how turn coke into crack
I’m that dro you bout to smoke
Break me down, roll me up
Light me up and take a puff... watch how fast I fuck you up
I’m that dope shop on willow, bumpin 24/7
I’m that bullet hole in your chest that need a new dressing
I’m that nigga never stressing
Follow my first mind no second guessing
Why should I when I got my weapon
I love my people but if my people get out of line
I’ll be that nigga that crept down on face from behind
I’m that nigga on the grind
Dodging them dick suckers, the jakes, or one time, fuck them motherfuckers
They know I hustle, I’m in nolia daily
Let’s get this shit straight, Master P never took care of me
I got what I deserve and work for what I got
Now I got cut throaters on every fucking block

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah, this how this shit going down
You know, Years Later
Niggas do their own thing
Niggas wanna do what the fuck they wanna do ya know
And I dont give a lovely motherfuck, fuck another nigga ya understand?
I got a producer from france on you motherfuckers
Yeah, you hear this motherfucking vibe right here
Motherfucker way from france
Lonzo
Yeah, that’s how we ride
Cut Throat nigga
