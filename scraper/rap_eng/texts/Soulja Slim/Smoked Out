[Intro]

[?]

[Hook]
You not invited to my smoke out, my smoke out
So you might as well get the fuck out, the fuck out
I ain't never ever smoked with you, smoked with you
Snorted coke or snorted dope with you, dope with you

[Verse 1]
You niggas got that shit real bad, I'm still mad
Straight play me like a [?]
I don't need no fucking friends no, while I'm in for the indo
Just brought what I brought from Cali for me
Ain't none of this in the N.O
Get mad [?] fuck you want but I'm smoking skunk
Followed by a camo hunk that keep it crunk
I know my lungs dirty, dirty but I ain't worried
Think I'm a joke like my name was [?]
I got some [?] player, that's [?] player
[?] player, I jab left
You think cause my eyes [?] tight, better have no sight
You got me down bad am I right
[?] and whatever else after that
Carry on, bust 'em open like a bottle
I out smoke your whole clique by myself
And tell y'all if y'all don't smoke too much, that's bad for your health

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got that shit that killed Kennedy
Who got the [?]

Break it off, take it off, just let me see

I want mines and all niggas in the lose change
Gotta get it while it's good cause if it's not

Each cocked [?] me up
I'm going out like Tony Montana, [?] me up
Won't give a [?] motherfuck who could touch
Fuck with us and [?] come with the head bust

Keep it killer, on the reala for [?]
Til the cell filled up with [?]

[Hook]
