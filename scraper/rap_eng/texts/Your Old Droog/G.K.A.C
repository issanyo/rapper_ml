[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Seatbelt off, but son was strapped
Cruising way past the limit with a gun in his lap
Thuggin', buggin' swearing his phone tapped
Used to be the rubber band man
I guess he just snapped
Ain't like he went to ranges and learned to spray gats
So he practiced on baseheads and stray cats
The world treated him like Three-Fifths, so he copped fo' fifths
No Mother Marys or Josephs - he'd blow spliffs
Laced with PCP, not too discerning
But shit was like a ritual when dude was burning
Son would roll up, without a hold up
Take out a 20 and break that ho up
In a crumpled up piece of money, the wildest dread
Heard he referred to his blicky as Nicky
And the bullet - he called her Miss Lead
One time he passed the boys in blue and saw red
Then a calm little voice inside his head said

[Hook: Your Old Droog]
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Said he'd put that pig in a blanket...

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
And he did, he just blanked kid
Angel on his shoulders called him but he banged it
There's nothing to do or say to stop him
And couldn't get in his way
Like the blood gang he had a Nine and a Trey
But a 12-gauge, fresh out the case
Would be the weapon used to pop the officer in the face
Then started the chase
It was unnervin', cars swervin' all over the place
Just when you thought it's 'bout to end, no
He turned around blasting at them cowards out the window
With the 9-milli
The voice in his head on a continuous loop like Milli Vanilli
(girl you know it's)

[Hook: Your Old Droog]
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Gotta kill a cop, gotta kill a cop pop
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Imma put that pig in a blanket
Imma put that pig in a blanket

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
He shot him, then tried to breeze, skate out of town
They spot him, hopped in their V's to chase him down
And blocked him, he couldn't leave, then screamed a clown
"We got him"; "Get on your knees, get on the ground!"
He steps out, lights flashing in his eyes
His psychotic mind still tries to rationalize
Wheels start turning, feeling shifty
Thinking "if I'm going down, I'll take some more of you cowards with me"
He bust one, bust two
Put 'em on God's guest list - plus a few
Trust fund kids, he don't trust you
What's truly sad is a man felt like he had to go this route
Just to get his just due
"What's justice?" he yelled to the suckers
Then proceeded to back out the MAC-10 on you fuckers
Kept bucking, like an old soldier
'Till one of their slugs caught him in the shoulder
So he ducked behind the car
Realizing he's 'bout to spend the rest of his life behind bars
Depressed, knowing he's going down for the crime
He pressed Nicky's lips against his one last time

[Outro: Sample of "The Pigs' Music" by Frank Zappa]
Spider: If we understood then maybe we can help the pigs understand
John: Nah, the problem with that is you think the pigs are essentially kind at heart, but the pigs are essentially pigs
