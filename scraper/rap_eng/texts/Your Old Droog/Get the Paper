Wake up in the morning and I go and get the paper
Gotta get the paper
Every morning gotta go and get the paper
And a nice cup of coffee

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Order one with 2 espresso shots in it called ‘Redeye’
Ain't no tellin' how many newspapers I read
Buy several papers and I read them all twice
So I can recite them to you backwards, son, I'm nice
Went straight to the art section, started flexin'
Like, look ma, I'm on stage shootin' dice with Sean Price
Henny straight, never on ice
But I don't even drink like that
Making a grip is my only vice

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning and I go and get the paper
Gotta get the paper
Every morning gotta go and get the paper
And a nice cup of coffee

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Lookin' at my paper, it's about that time
About them times, when life hands you limes
Make guac, you know guac, as in green, like guacamole
I don't know why they started sayin' guap, should've been stopped
My synopsis is real, never had that OD mixing feel
With cats who make waves and happen to get a 360 deal
Don't let them tie your financial du rag too tight
When you go to sleep at night
It restricts cash flow get your stash Miracle-Gro
With the ill lyrical flow (lyrical miracle)
Fans is mad fickle though
So don't let them solo too long on a skin piccolo
Or flute, why you think it's called woodwinds
I always found it hard to choose good friends
I'm a bad judge of character
Can't even spot underage chicks
Page 6 caught in the matrix

[Hook]
Wake up in the morning and I go and get the paper
Gotta get the paper
Every morning gotta go and get the paper
And a nice cup of coffee

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
It's the same routine, except now my boots clean
Or I'm in gators, moving like gator with a cute fay
That's the dark crack back ally hallie bought shit same lane
Now it's silicone valley
Crib in studio city, when in NY I never go to the studio in the city
It's Green Point where all signs point to the green skizz bizz
That I hit up Fort Greene my high rise in Manhattan got the ill skyscraper view
Gross paper like pay-per-view, you still got a paper due, dealin' with midterms and finals
While we make deals on a kid terms pressin' up vinyls
Knowledge of a person at age 80
Wise like a sage don't you see the grade, lady?
But I don't look stressed
This an open book test
