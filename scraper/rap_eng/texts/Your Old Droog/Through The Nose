[Hook]
Stayed reading, became the wisest
Breathing exercises through the nose
Back in the days, they didn’t want to sign us
Now they gon' have to pay through the nose
A lot of people go straight to the brain or the vein
While some take drugs through the nose
Pretty soon you won’t be able to listen to Old Droog
Consume it strictly through the nose

[Verse 1]
Close the window, it’s drafty
My man said they gon' name a brand of cocaine after me
Old Droog
We already brought that uncut
I’d fine-tune an already fine tune, I’m a nut
Play the game, coach the team, and I’d ref it
Saying, forget these rap labels ‘bout to be effing with def and
They said signing with Droog was a definite
But I been in that building, it smells like death in it
You smell that? I don’t care, let them hear that
Be content with the panic, go meditate
Plot out planning, then I’m shot out of a cannon
On a social media fast, Instagramming famine
And haven’t looked in the mirror in months
There’s other flaws to examine
Some people get plastic surgery
Manifest their insecurities through the nose
I mean, just look at Michael Jackson

[Hook]
Stayed reading, became the wisest
Breathing exercises through the nose

Now they gon' have to pay through the nose
A lot of people go straight to the brain or the vein
While some take drugs through the nose
Pretty soon you won’t be able to listen to Old Droog
Consume it strictly through the nose

[Verse 2]
As far as rhymes, I’m like The Dream with shot blocks
Since we used to say, get your snot box rocked
And loud was called piff, only dance to reggae
Otherwise I play the wall stiff
You saw me on the train, shaking, going through withdrawal
Ya Imaginary Droog like Cliff Paul
Now I’m sober and the fans got the sniffles y'all
With holes in they nasal canal like a wiffle ball
Got no hops and I run slow
Your Old Droog will be immortalized for keeping it a hund-o
Stayed getting robbed, but he bust his gun though
Told him “I ain’t got it”, I left it in El Segundo
What’s that? That’s my wallet
Turn signals in the Impala ticking, politicking
Kicking it in Gullah Gullah
The pretty mamas on the beach frolicking
Puffing on that Harlequin

[Hook]
We stayed reading, became the wisest
Breathing exercises through the nose

[Outro]
Breathing in, I am breathing in for my father
Breathing in, I am a continuation of my father
Breathing out, I smile to my father in me
Breathing in, I feel interested in my in breath
I am breathing out and I feel very light
In my- in my body, father do you feel as light?
Breathing in I smile with my mother inside me
The two of us breathing in together, what great joy
Breathing in together, what great joy
Breathing in together, what great joy
Breathing in together, what great joy
Breathing in together, what great joy
