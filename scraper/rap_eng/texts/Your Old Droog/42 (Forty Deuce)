[Intro]
Uh huh
Oh, word?
Mhm, hm

[Verse 1]
Me and my team played the deuce
Back when you used to think you could boost your high with a loose
In front of the old port authority
I was the bustdown King, Newport authority
The internal biological menthol mechanism let me know the exact time to pass itâ€”ace
Eat a hot dog, get mustard on your face
42nd Street is the place
Play stop sign on that strip all the time, square
Wherever the hoes is at, I'm there
At the theatre catching flicks
I saw you with your bum-ass girl wearing matchin' kicks (Bum)
Son, I even sold Stevie nicks (Uh)
And an O of regs to Fran Leibowitz (Who dat?)
There's none of that now, we make hits
Like Times Square at night, I'm lit

[Hook]
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce (Forty deuce)

Some clap on the two and the four
Others clap on the one and the three (I won't judge y'all, though)
You walkin' down 42nd at night?
You might run into me

[Verse 2]
Clap on the two and the four
Hit the bank, take paper out like new shoes in the store
You know I can't wait to buy new shoes
Zooted, bumping "I Can't Wait" by Nu Shooz
808s smelling like reaganomics
On forty deuce, declining offers to see comics
I'm good, the rap game is a comedy show
If I need a laugh I just watch their video
I wanna know who's your yay supplier
Tell em to meet me in front of Gray's Papaya
Where it used to be, smoking a loosey
Just left the Hard Rock Cafe, feeling woozy
Got the blues, walking past bb kings
See how long it take to get to the shuttle, time it
How he flip Nu Shooz in this tough guy climate?
Like Times Square at night, I'm lit

[Hook]
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce (Forty deuce)

Some clap on the two and the four
Others clap on the one and the three
You walkin' down 42nd at night?
You might run into me

[Verse 3]
Never duckin' out the way for a tourist shot
Fuck with me, that's more business for the florist spot
Got two fire verses and the chorus hot
Plus a eight-bar bridge
A peek into this man's mental on grand central
Tell a story and throw in a hint of oriental
Skated through Bryant park when the sky went dark
Hit the diner and ordered an omelette

[Hook]
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce
On the deuce, on the four
On the deuce (Forty deuce)

Some clap on the two and the four
Others clap on the one and the three
You walkin' down 42nd at night?
You might run into me
