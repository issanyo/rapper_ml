Since I knocked the world off its axis
People wanna ask us for a special kinda access
Problem is, we don’t know you, we don’t know you
Rappers run up and give me dap, mad strong
Saying they been waiting long like, “We gotta do a song"
Yeah, but the problem is, we don’t know you, we don’t know you
(We don’t believe you, you need more people)

[Verse 1]
Y.O.D.’s a student of the game, we passed the class
Cause nobody could read you dudes like he do
These cats is jaded, tryna do what Jay did
Wasting studio time, getting faded
Said you had a classic, that shit was C-graded
Get degraded and I don’t worry about karma from cats we’ve shaded
Sky’s the limit, my life shines bright, no matter who tries to dim it
Shit hits hard, whether you’re in Brooklyn or in Decatur
Your music’s just an indicator of a shitty ass time in rap
Escape the ringtone era and now they peddling apps
Old Droog is the best, keep it real, B
That’s why he got that seven figure deal, figgadeal me?
He once took a lesbian on a date, the present day great
Everything I say resonate

[Verse 2]
I’m just killing off rappers and making space
They’re more concerned with documenting what’s taking place
Then what’s taken place, they don’t come to work
They come to imitate "Fade to Black" and make funny faces
Whenever their producers play the track
I’m the opposite, barely even know what we got on air
Comatose when I’m not on air
As long as I’m caking and can afford to go on vacation
I care less if I’m boring in a social situation
Who wants to be the life of the party?
Or after life of the after party
And I don’t make music for no party
Just for my dudes and chicks who got in 2006
And got buried in Ed Hardy
You hardly hit me up when I wore them same
Milli Vanilli SB’s and black and red Airmaxes, practice for years
I don’t think you really know how sharp the rhyme axe is

[Verse 3]
Shhh, quiet, I play it low like Iranians calling they self Persians
Dude would change the subject, deflect it and divergent
So don’t even try to cast dispersions, son
My rough’s iller than your mastered versions
Old Droog joints was getting recorded non-stop
With no filter on the mic, you knew it was gonna pop (without going pop)
I don’t make music for mass consumption
Why you got that makeup on, you masking something?
‘Far as showcasing my repertoire, I kept it raw
I tried to smooth it out, it felt like we was diluted
Had me ready to throw a riot
And die looting amongst these rap mutants, hollering and hooping
Doing finger guns, but who they shooting?
Hardly ever get computers 'puting
They putting off while I put in work, I’m like Putin
