[Chorus]
Where the rhymes at? I’m hearing less and less
Everybody's in the trap now, it’s a mess
And their backstories be so sketch
We laugh at ‘em while they rappin' like Bobbito and Stretch

My producer hits them buttons like he play chess
Million ways to move that wet like Liquid TV on VHS
Understatements say I’m one of the best
Ya’ll setting up your own interviews, I’ve only done press under duress
And I charge a fee to open up my beak
Your Droog’s got specials on A&E they payin me to speak
What you doin’ today?
Just flew in for the Q&A to spew an array of jewels
Vintage YOD, pop shit like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
These cats crying like I’m holocaust-denying
Clapped ‘em and tossed the iron, catch me in the Porsche flying
Up the Belt Parkway, let it bump at the Barclays
Got it lit like arcades with few dark days left on the horizon, my star rising
I’m a polarizing figure
About to get ten figures now my figures’ll be polarizing
The game’s bipolar, not the rapper
Look at you funny when you bummy, when you dapper they dap ya’
Shout out to Skizz, this a slapper
Hot like the Super Nintendo adapter
Meth lab goin’ up on a Tuesday
Gotcha girl in the cut reading Newsday
I’m high while the Blues play, you clockin’ dudes
Reading gossip blogs tryin’ to figure out who’s gay, you gay
You care more about my looks than I do
Studying my bars more than I did, and I wrote ‘em
Spend the whole of your day Droog rhyme quotin’
Me, I get in that booth like I’m votin’
Don’t worry about us, you’ll do fine
I shine because ain’t nobody else grizzle on my mind
It’s a cinema when I pen a new line
You need a verse? Give me cash, fuck a W-9
I’m used to bundles from cats who held ransom and pitched rock
But for Stack Bundles, Ransom, and Hitchcock (Clue)
Doo Wop not four dude’s singing in a barbershop
And can’t forget my man S and S

[Chorus]

Smell that funk from a block away
A lot of you rappers gotta brush your tongue and use binaca spray
Open your mouth and we’re countin’ the death toll
You need to focus on a different kinda’ breath control
Might have to use that Listerine twice
Be nice, OK here’s some Dentine Ice
I got a joint named gum, sample free
Said I'mma be the G.O.A.T by my 3rd LP
We dropped the Y.O.D EP, added 8 bonus joints, it’s the Y.O.D LP
That’s the reissue for the collectors
Four more albums and I’m done son, I’m only doing lectures
