[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Have all the respect but I’m still making dodo
These lames hating hard, it’s all greazy but when they see me, let’s take a photo
Rappers don’t want to go toe to toe, they Toto
Fuck a mic, see me in Kyoto on the koto though
Born in China like Marbury, call me Daryl Lynch Strawberry
Your moms can only tell you in so many ways be good
Where you crazy hood, what you doing?
Making moves with my ghetto squad
Doing the old tech drills, swipe down a chick’s ass with a metro card
Then ran a train, but fuck bitches it’s that green
Like a plantain that we planted with tame
How you doing? Can’t complain
Your Droog going stomping on the campaign
I don’t pussyfoot around, put it down
With Miami’s own EFN
Pop shit and don’t care who we offend

[Hook: REKS]
This is what you call revolutionary ride music
Vibe to it, there ain’t no telling who I influence
(My lifestyle) ignorance and intelligence
(Blowing clouds of loud, mixing up the elements)

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5’9”]
Started out a featherweight, worked my way to heavyweight
Started drinking every day, the lord took my legs away
Told me I was speeding so I slowed down and I told him
I don’t need them, I'ma sober up and levitate
Some call it a spiritual awakening
But the feeling down my spine I got from not making
It gave me a fearing chill from laziness
Nobody wants to fold, regardless if you unfold
You know it’s real when your own call and put you on hold
But all praises due to the most high
Hope both my daughters know before I die I thought they were beautiful
I’m laughing all the way to the bank, see I get it
Envision, everybody that paint just can’t be Banksy
My spirit is the clearest it’s ever been, with no distractions
Except maybe my bitch overreacting
But based off of past shit that I put her through she halfway forgave me for
I would say she acting how she supposed to be acting
I’m just a real nigga straight from my mother’s stomach
Ain’t enough cloth for all of us to be cut from it
Mark my words, my words shall leave marks on these street corners
And y’all are gonna pay me homage

[Verse 3: O.C.]
When I’m on I sound off in this
Prepare for war, everything’s fair game as I
Lock on the target, pop it and aim
Exotic weed, indulge your brain
But those a whole 'nother strain
Arabic ties to my government name and shit
Head blow harder than a martyr strapped with a bomb to his body, word is bond
Quantum of Solace, acknowledge the service providers
EFN, from MIA to NY his reach extends
I got that zen-like flow, as I dive into a meditative state like Zo
Now I’m narrating in the zone
Reciprocating love with crazy hugs so I’m all good
Pop bottles of pain, twist them backwoods
Then form a cypher and spark a bonfire
On these NY streets of concrete and barbed wire
This applied to the users, this is what you call revolutionary ride music
