[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Yo
Don't compare yourself to Droog, dude, you suck
You'd probably think I'm rich with the tones I construct
Made enough to buy a few constructs
But nevermind that old money, I'm tryna get a new buck
Buy the nubuck, fresh size 12
And ain't nobody help me - we did it by ourselves
Inspiring the cops and beefing blocks
Think you'll ever see me, must be chiefin rocks
Like Green Day, they album dookie
Coming around washed up, on that Pookie
That's why they get the disconnected message when they try and hit me
Switch the number on 'em: it's new jack city
Went from prom queen to prom fiend
That's why we never gonna speak, y'nahmean?
Take this wit' ya
There's 2 types of people: those who get asked for pictures and those who ask for a picture
Get your shinebox, and a box of shinin rock
I never needed no help tryna rock
My 9 cocked
Shoot holes in your designer smock
Then I'm out with the smoothness
I do this

[Hook: Rob Base and Frank Zappa (sampled)]
"Help I'm a rock"
"I wanna rock right now"

[Verse 2: Wiki]
Way I rock: hot, 180 degrees
Your shit soft, rock babies to sleep
It's a lullaby
But them other guys hating on me
And you gonna die waiting to pee
I whip my dick out, piss straight in the street
Keep it stepping, stay never late on the beat
Kids keep a weapon when they skate in the street
One blow left and with his face in at feet
Same place I was taking a leak
Take it from me: you can't take what you see
Cover your eyes so you don't see me in 3
Holy ghost, father, the son - believe in we
Wikity Wik' with the sickness spittin'
Chick pretty? Yeah she pretty here
I might grab a titty but that's pretty much it
Don't mean to be a dickhead but that's pretty much Wik'
Amount of time in the city I spent
Made me the man I am, but don't pity the kid
City gave me everything I got
Everything with locks
Every single rhyme I rock

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Edan]
Take 2 of the man with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface with cocaine cardio
Kane circa '89 audio
Pardon yo long-nose Pinocchio studio portfolio
Braggadocio, toe-to-toe rap rodeo
Your homie know we won't be going along
Lasso his nose, pull him over slow, throw the KO
In a showcase of total control to catch kudos
Tetsuo prior to part two though
Set fire to all nouveau, pseudo, calm your noodle, thoughts you throw
Who gon' block the Judo chop
Your crew too slow, who to do so
New styllin' just dilate ya challengers
Worse than Bruce vs. Lew Alcindor, remember
The less you need, the more wealthy
The bells compel me to (rock), so God help me

[Hook]
