[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Yo, I ran up on her like "quick, before your man come"
She said I talk real slick and I'm handsome
But I'm ghost soon as the chick throw a tantrum
All my dudes who ain't shit, this your anthem
We pull up in a Phantom, waiving these male groupies off
Like "bruh, I appreciate your fandom
But I'm tryna score with a bitty
And you ain't got a vagina or titties
The fuck we talking for?"
You think I come out here for politicking
I just open up my wallet tricking like have that, switch
Yeah, some would call it thirst
But I know I get reimbursed later when I'm going through her purse
Stealing her phone and ID, I'm a scumbag
One of the greatest at that, check out the humblebrag
But listen girl, let me be me
Don't be mad that I bought Newports with EBT
Two days wearing the same outfit
Go and tell your friends about
[?] gas
Go and tell your friends that I nutted fast, I don't care

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
I still got some, that's the summary
A changed man, I let shorties come to me, that's right
I don't court bitches
Getting bad prosecutor attorney type chicks you know, court bitches
Who never seen no crack vials
All your hoes smoke Black & Milds and listen to Mac Wild
Moms freaking to the Weeknd
Last night I caught her geeking
Not Spanish but I look it, call me Sorta-Rican
Yellow tape, move away, there's nothing left to see
That little hooker Stephanie gon' be the death of me
In a world would wonder who's he talking bout
This little scallywag from New York with Cali swag
Don't even live a mile away
Come through with two bottles and we pour 'em like the Jew holiday
If they could see your pal today
Came a long way from getting shorty screwed up off Alize

[Outro]
Cause I did that whole thing. I went BMCC. I had two jobs. I used to go to sleep hungry and then one day I just decided to start dancing. And these Russian girls taught me how hate and how to hustle them. Nine months later I had five thousand dollar titties on my chest. Do you feel me?
