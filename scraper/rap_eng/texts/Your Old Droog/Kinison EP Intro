It's basically rappers, you know, I just don't like rap music man
I haven't caught on to it, I don't think it's an art form
You heard the kind of music that I like, I like Rock N' Roll
I like music that just kicks you in the fucking face
Instead of, you know, the shit that anybody can do man, this uh you know "I'm a robber, I'm a thief, I'm a big rip-off without someone else's song I just jack off..I don't play any instruments and don't write no songs, all I like to do is play with my ding-dong"
Come on man, you ever seen a rapper rap without grabbin' his cock?
Come on, they all grab their dicks you know why?
Because they don't play any fucking instruments!
