[Intro]
Yo, I remember comin' up, I wanted to be the nicest
Now, I just wanna have a nice day, real calm

[Verse]
I just wanna have a nice day
Say some rhymes like I’m Dice Clay
Sip water with cubes from the ice tray
Order grape juice, kettle
Sufferin' from doliosis
Old friends, I had to dead ‘em
Wouldn’t even take a girl to Wet Seal
Shawty wants me to buy her Louboutins, get real
My life style dubious and my ear’s where the doobie is
'Bout to light it, can’t you see I’m delighted?
Yeah right, I’m at my wits end
Other day, I wrote a long ass email and forgot to hit send
But I can’t complain, I’m a grown man
Can’t be mad things ain’t go accordin’ to plan when you don’t plan
We created art like Salvador Dali
No more polly want a cracker, now these crackers wanna polly
If I had social skills, I’d be on probably, poppin' molly
Bein' a jolly good fellow in Hollywood mellow
At corporate parties, peepin' shawty doing vibrato on the cello
Them cats ill, doin' the rapid alternation of two adjacent notes, that’s trill
Yes, I study music on my dolly
Drink stoli only hang with those I call kin like Macaulay
Listenin' to time tick on my rollie
Tryna have a nice day like Mick Foley

[Outro]
What y'all want from me?
I give y'all what I can give y'all
