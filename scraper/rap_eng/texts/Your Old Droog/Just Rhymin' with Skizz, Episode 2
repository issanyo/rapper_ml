Where the rhymes at? I'm hearing less and less
Everybody's in the trap now, it's a mess
And their back-stories be so sketch
We laugh at 'em while they rappin' like Bobbito and Stretch
My producer hit them buttons like he play chess
Million ways to move that wet like liquid TV on VHS
It’s a understatement to say I'm one of the best
Y'all setting up your own interviews i've only done press under duress
And I charge a fee to open up my beak, your Droog got
Specials on A&E, they're paying me to speak
What you doing today? just flew in for the Q&A
To spew an array of jewels
Vintage YOD, pop shit like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
These cats cryin like I'm holocaust denyin
Clap 'em then toss the iron, catch me in the Porsche
Flyin up the Belt Parkway, let it bump at the Barclays
Got it lit like arcades, with few dark days left on the horizon
My star rising
I'm a polarizing figure
Bout to get 10 figures now my figures'll be polarizin
The game is bipolar, not the rapper
Look at you funny when you bummy, when you dapper they dap ya
Shoutout to Skizz, this a slapper
Hot like the Super Nintendo adapter
Math Lab goin’ up — On a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut reading Newsday
I'm high while the blues play, you clocking dudes
Reading gossip blogs tryna figure out who’s gay, you gay!
Ya' care about my looks more than I do
Studying my bars more than I did, and I wrote ‘em
Spend the whole of your day Droog rhyme quotin'
Me, I get in that booth like I'm votin'
Don't worry bout us, you'll do fine, you see
I shine cause ain't nobody else grizzle on my mind
It's a cinema when I pen a new line
You need a verse? Gimme cash, fuck a W-9
