Where the rhymes at? I'm hearing less and less
Everybody's in the trap now, it's a mess
And their back-stories be so sketch
We laugh at 'em while they rappin' like Bobbito and Stretch
My producer hit them buttons like he play chess
Million ways to move that wet like liquid TV on VHS
It’s a understatement to say I'm one of the best
Y'all setting up your own interviews I've only done press under duress
And I charge a fee to open up my beak, your Droog got
Specials on A&E, they're paying me to speak
What you doing today? just flew in for the Q&A
To spew an array of jewels
Vintage YOD, pop shit like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
These cats cryin' like I'm holocaust denyin'
Clap 'em then toss the iron, catch me in the Porsche
Flyin' up the Belt Parkway, let it bump at the Barclays
Got it lit like arcades, with few dark days left on the horizon
My star risin'
I'm a polarizing figure
'Bout to get 10 figures now my figures'll be polarizin'
The game is bipolar, not the rapper
Look at you funny when you bummy, when you dapper they dap ya'
Shoutout to Skizz, this a slapper
Hot like the Super Nintendo adapter
Math Lab goin’ up — on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut reading Newsday
I'm high while the blues play, you clocking dudes
Reading gossip blogs tryna figure out who’s gay, you gay!
Ya' care about my looks more than I do
Studying my bars more than I did, and I wrote ‘em
Spend the whole of your day Droog rhyme quotin'
Me, I get in that booth like I'm votin'
Don't worry bout us, you'll do fine
I shine cause ain't nobody else grizzle on my mind
It's a cinema when I pen a new line
You need a verse? Gimme cash, fuck a W-9

[Verse: 2]
I'm used to bundles, with cats who held ransom
With pitched rock off to stack bundles, ransom a Hitchcock
'Doo-woop' not four dudes singin' in the Barber Shop
I can't forgot my man Es-n-Es
Where the rhymes at? I'm hearing less and less
Everybody's in the trap now, it's a mess
And their back-stories be so sketch
We laugh at 'em while they rappin' like Bobbito and Stretch
Smell that funk from a block away
A lot of you rappers gotta to brush your tongues and use [?] spray
Open up your mouth and we're countin' up the death toll
You need to focus on a different kind of breath control
Might have to use that Listerine, twice
Be nice, okay, here's some Dentyne Ice
I got a joint named Gum, sample free
I'm gonna be the GOAT by my third LP
We dropped the WILD D.E.P., added eight bonus joints - it's the Y.O.D. LP
That's the re-issues for the collectors
Four more albums and I'm done, son,  I'm only doing lectures
