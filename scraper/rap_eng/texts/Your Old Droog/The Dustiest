[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Too honest I don't spit G in chicks' ears
Been dusty, my droog hasn't bought a new pair of kicks in 6 years
Remember being downtown like Petula Clark [?]
Now I'm dusty with crusty shit in my unused earring holes
These young cats so hype, grill-coppin'
I threw my fronts out back when MySpace was still poppin'
Used to go as long as three whole months without getting a cut
Had to go hit up a fat bitch for some butt
I get domed, but no intimacy
Droog grew up wanting to smash Ashanti - I wasn't into Missy
Never go to [?] or Fordham Road
Catch me shopping at a strip called Can't Afford 'Em Road
Located right off the BK Bridge
If I ain't there I'm boosting out the Century 21 at Bay Ridge
This some stuff most would keep to themselves
But nah I spreads the knowledge - I do this for the kids

[Outro: Your Old Droog]
I'm not ugly, I'm the ugliest
Not dusty, I'm the dustiest
You might think you dusty, but trust me this
I'm the du-du-du-du-dustiest
I'm not ugly, I'm the ugliest
Not dusty, I'm the dustiest
You might think you dusty, but trust me this
I'm the dustiest, the dustiest
