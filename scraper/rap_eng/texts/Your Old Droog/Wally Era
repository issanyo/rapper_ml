[Verse 1: Conway]
Look, shotty with the drum, body on the gun
Everybody got a body where I'm from
Niggas across town heard the shotty when it rung
I rock the ostrich SB's, bottom of 'em gum
Machine, bitch, I'm from the bottom of the slum
Look, the nigga breathe wrong so I shot him in the lung
The silencer is on the nozzle of the gun
I shot him on my Ducati hit the throttle and then vroooom
I sip the bottle 'til it's done
I played your new shit then I promised it was flung
Out the window of the Masi' let's be honest I'm the one
Everybody get a drum look how I body shit for fun
I been this dude since you was still in school
Getting ridiculed, 22 for my tennis shoes
I told Monk you niggas fool
I'm not impressed with you little moves
That shit is miniscule
While you on the internet, ranting, throwing subliminals
I'm counting blue money, your bitch with me, she in the nude
Fronting like, "you that nigga getting it done here"
With them bullshit chains I wouldn't let my son wear
It's a lot of kings but it's only one here
And that's me, actually nigga, this shit is unfair
The way I body shit in the booth, you couldn't compare
So many straps my living room is looking like a gun fair
Conway...

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Cowards always acting like they gon' spray
But wouldn't shoot a text to say they on their way
A call back I'm all that and a bottle of Andre
With three white hoes, like Kardashians they on Ye
And on E, listening to Ron G blend tapes
[?] headed to the Mondrian
Last week was shutting down the Monte Carlo
Saw you losers only winning 'cause brothers set the bar low
And I don't limbo
Make 'em all wear red, never spare lead
Airheads like them bimbo-ass hoes
Who be posting pictures talking 'bout gym flow
My M.O.? Brim low - rather stretch the limo
That's what happens when you top tier
Last three years I ain't drive anywhere or cop gear
Back of the automobile dippin'
See a Lambo outside like "Damn, you still whippin'?"
And I ain't stunting or guilt trippin'
All accurate facts spit, immaculate script-flippin'
Get covered too much to save a newspaper clippin'
You suckers can't rhyme you just pantomime flippin'
Hardly rappin', they Charlie Chaplin
Rhyming over vocals like me, when we didn't have beat tapes
Now I fly to France just to eat crÃªpes
And have Skype meetings with bitches feeding me grapes
I'm big enough to do it...
