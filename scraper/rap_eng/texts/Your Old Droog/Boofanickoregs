[Chorus]
Betty girl, she stay down, keep her on the Greyhound
With that stuff between her legs (*bus departing now*)
Out of HobbyTown we moving reefer by the pound
While you boofanickoregs (struggling)
I do nothing of the sort, in some fancy vacation resort
Eating bacon, cheese, and eggs (with orange juice)
And a new beat CD writing, fiending to get back in the booth
While you boofanickoregs

(What you doing?)
Pull up in the Bentley, speaking eloquently
With a bad thing caressing a fella gently
(What you doing with that?) Smashing her out
Cashing out, throw a baby bash in your mouth
Don't forget to RSVP, hit me back when you are less creepy
Supersonic got the glove off GP
School a soldier on the general principle
While I take a pull off a Winston in Instanbul
Transform like Shia LaBeouf, outside of music
I'm shyer but I'm outspoken fire when I get in the booth
Outside of the country hit me party sully
Excuse me while I throw another baby bash on the bell, he said:
I like a chick who gets on her knees and begs
But no reason they can't adequately season the cheese and eggs
Don't forget to RSVP, hit me back when you are less creepy
The only list you're on is Craig's

[Chorus]

(Broke ass)
I see you walking wild funny, married with children like Al Bundy
Queens cat, you used to call your pal dunny
I called mines droog, catch them on the balcony
With baby gal, honey, getting money
Rise to the occasion like Snoop Lion, I'm in that coupe flying
Down the ave with all the acclaim I was bound to have
To tell the truth, we was the least surprised
Been a beast, wait for the limited edition b-sides
Out to dinner with baby girl, she greased the thighs
Trophy wife? They looking at me like, "He's the prize"
Cats is only fly on Easter, you guys can't get a place
So y'all see me eating and feast your eyes
You know me, low key, broke free from living like a caged animal
And it all started with the pen like Hannibal
Silence lambs, when he stacked cheddar
You can't see him famalam
Back to shorty, transporting grams of the yam

[Chorus 2x]
(Broke ass motherfucker)
