[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Sim simmo, who got the keys to my limo?
YOD, get a snowjob with no problemo
If bustin' nuts is the M.O
Droog never begs a bimbo to get her legs akimbo
Smuts, 17 to 45 is my demo
You still on that "please listen to my demo"
Holdin' up traffic on the FDR Drive
They wanna hear my music? I'm like "check the archive"
Give me a thumb drive, I still won't play it
My joint dumb live, you still gon' play it
A choice tale that's also multi-layered
Spit it on the voicemail, son I can't wait to lay it
I tend to chill, hang around, parlay with
Homies from the ville; Browns, not Fayette
You still spittin' bout guns but your guns ain't spittin'
Livin' afraid, say it don't spray it
And I'm a classic man
That's why they feel it all the way in Kazakhstan
Even want that loud pack out in Pakistan
I do a show, stans pack the stands
With they hands up like a stick-up, we out there in the sticks
Like they better not act up cause we'll beat a hick up in a hiccup
Got your interest piqued
So hot you gotta stop listenin', leave it alone for a week
Real shit, you gotta let it sit
Think you could live my life, you wish
You don't even do ish
I start at 6, get off around 2-ish, save money like I'm Jewish (You are Jewish)
Hittin' y'all with my newest
I only do this cause this new age is sewage
Heard your freestyle, y'all brothers is soft
You need to get off, study me, Buddy Lee
Illest flow in the whole district, and not induced
Holistic, don't believe me, you can hold this dick
Spent years trapped inside a small room
Saying nothin', your silence spoke volumes
Only one I talked to was the corner store Ahkhee
Ain't nobody give me the look like [?]
Didn't even peep the shade they gave us
We was in the spot watching [?]
Maino beefin' with Bunky SA
Put out free hits and watch the junkies press play
Resum√© speaks for itself, top shelf
Got wealth, clout, from the tunes I belt out
Too doofy to jump on tables
And stone-faced sit-downs with these labels
Mystique, the swag is magnifique
All that and a bag of [?]
Not about bread I can't speak

Yo there's not enough beat
