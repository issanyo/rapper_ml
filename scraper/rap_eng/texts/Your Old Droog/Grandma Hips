[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Wagwan Foghorn Leghorn
Come Halloween I'm the wrong one to egg on
Four Megatron limbs harmin 'em with homonyms
Far from PC, I'm VC with his arm in the rim
Got psalms and hymns (what are those?)
Kick a rhyme on a whim
Come for me - chance of you surviving extra slim
Like a skinny MF DOOM, it'll be next to Grimm
Knock you in your loose lips for popping off at the gums
Like a packet of Eclipse
Dawg you slipped for not recognizing YOD was god since we used to boost chips
And the box juice Ssips
Rockin pants that swish
Then I link with rich to flip product
The product of that was utterly hypnotic
Your mind is not equipped to understand our quips
Shut up and keep -- with your grandma hips
Man, built like my auntie, hopped online same joke
Eternally sleep telling cats to stay woke
By doing this I'm a neighborhood treasure
I pack some more -- in just for good measure
That's a good measure, ain't it?
I can see the future and that ain't it
For tryna taint the pictures I painted
I just might go start a residency
Pump it out to Gramercy
Teacher said I was nice with the grammar, see
Lord have mercy
Thirsty, firstly known for flowing with finesse like Percy P
And going hand to hand, can't see me man to man
Plus your man's aura's fucking Bananarama pandora
Y'all cats sedentary on the road to dead and buried
Practically souvenirs, haven't made a move in years
Now give me dap or a five
Old Droog the greatest rapper alive
Shut the fuck up

[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Compare the flow to an avalanche
A battle ram, HIV should be my acronym
Sick pen game like a Bhurka game sonogram
Born to kill, coming at ya like a porno cam
Ain't you know I smoke that fruity-color tucan?
Eat the pussy, get her wetter than the Hoover Dam
Ain't no need to say my name, bitch know who I am
Rappers singing in the closet like Luther Van
Get killed watching shows like Abraham
Next I'm at your funeral doing a Shmurda dance
Want beef, act like you're at the burger stand
Pull the burner, put holes in your cardigan
Bitch, I'm 'bout to get the artisan
Go Son of Sam have you shaking like Parkinson
Ain't going in unless my nigga sneak the Larkin in
Shoot a rapper just to help him with his marketin'
(Come on, now here we go)
Don't even get me started and
One phone call, now your family we targetin'
I'm about to wear my flow
Wrecking shit the parthenon
I walk in, they be like "who let the Martian in?"
Said I'm the best, it ain't a single nigga question it
Either it's the truth or these niggas disrespectin'
Took it as a sign every nigga kill they self
Changing of the guard, all these whack niggas exit
