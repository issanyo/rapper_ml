[Chorus]
Know your chances is thin
These cats lost before they even begin
Take the L then want to run it back again
But why play a game that you not gon' win?
(You not gon' win)
I only play the games that I win at
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(That I win)
("I only play the games that I win at")
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(Now, go in)

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Like I'm burning a disc, it's a dub for you
Son, I ain't gon' play the game unless I get the W
Them hoes geeks off the rap allure
They been coming to me for a genius bar before the Apple store
Bonkers
Then my favorite rappers was them guys from Yonkers
Knew that the time would come when I'mma conquer
When your Droog was headed to the Bronx with a honey dutch and a dama blanca
Selling nickels and some pennies
Remember when we used to rhyme and didn't get a penny?
Now we monetize
Take a quarter out, drop it in the meter, mama, try me on for size
It's quite racy
At the moment, whites don't claim me (Nope)
But I'mma fucking go platinum when they embrace me
The last star, fast car like Tracy
Who saw exactly what they doin' wrong, well, basically
(What?)

[Chorus]
Know your chances is thin
(Uh)
These cats lost before they even begin
(That's right)
Take the L then want to run it back again
But why play a game that you not gon' win?
(You not gon' win)
I only play the games that I win at
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(That I win)
("I only play the games that I win at")
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(I'm gon' win)



[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Here to stay, this ain't your fly-by-night
Study all day, lay something fly by night
Spent years working, outta mind, outta sight
Only poke my noggin' out when I got it right
Got too nice, punchlines was all Looney
But it was nothing new to those who already knew me (Who're you?)
The tall goonie
Y'all don't even know the names I was running with prior like Paul Mooney
Caught G.O.D., what about... ?
Wasn't right that first time, so I came again
Switch the name again
Before I finally resign myself to the fact that's not my game to win
And the realization was golden
Came back as Your Old Droog, that's your old friend
Even Kenny Rogers tried to told them
Gotta know when to hold or when to fold 'em
Especially when you... What?

[Chorus]
Know your chances is thin
These cats lost before they even begin
Take the L then want to run it back again
But why play a game that you not gon' win?
(You not gon' win)
I only play the games that I win at
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(That I win)
I only play the games that I win at
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
Before I ever had a FIFA 2K to play live
It was maddening, had to survive
Learned when you gotta pump fake or straight juke 'em
When they bomb first, then I bomb back like like Duke Nukem
Had rockets and guns, like DOOM, '95
Plotting like DOOM in '95 ("Hey!")
I listened to jazz, read the 7 pillars of zen
Learned ego and pride are the biggest killers of men
They still marvel at the verses when I rap, mom
But it's straight Marvel vs. Capcom
Every time we try to play the game they playing games
Fools is lucky I ain't saying names, bunch of lames
Still running with that payola scam
Need more than a couple of quarters to play your jam
Only get play if you got dough
These dudes like USPAâ€”they not Lo
You know my motto

[Chorus]
Know your chances is thin
These cats lost before they even begin
Take the L then want to run it back again
But why play a game that you not gon' win?
(Not gon' win)
I only play the games that I win at
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win
(That I win)
("I only play the games that I win at")
(I win at)
I only play the games that I win

[Outro]
