[Verse 1: Conway]
Hitting my helmet but I'm the champion still
Twisted up my face but bitches tell me that I'm handsome still
I'm tryna chill, mention the [?]
Hand me steel, I plan to kill more niggas than cancer will
We cop pleas and try to [?] still
Just to show them other fuck niggas that I am for real
(Y'all see what time it is nigga)
I left them them niggas smoked and laying still
Then we buried the hammers in [?]
My shooter right in the cut
Waiting on the green light to tighten you up
Automatic rifle you up
He 15 but he psycho as fuck
My bars like a knife in the gut (uh)
That mean that boy go in
My man shook the [?] blowin
Bring more dough in
Flowing with more arrogance than Lyor Cohen
[?]
You rap niggas dress suspect
Fuck success, man, I could give a fuck less than Russ West
Look, I've been a crook, [?]
With shit in the clip that cut vests and tear up flesh
Griselda, bitch, [?]
[?] with the long dread, Haiti flag, we cut necks
Yes, we up next [?]
That's why they upset
Fuck

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Yeah, yo, it's a setup
Keep a size 12 on they necks and never let up
It always be the fools thats down that try and get up
Dick rider for clout, it's pathetic
While my asthetic is hermetic
We never at them spots that these lames be orbitin'
With all that fast talking like an auctionist for biddin'
Going once, going twice
Sell a verse for the highest price
Hov said you can't be too nice
It's a mess, the game filled with mad stress
They wanna kill you or ballin' too hard like Fresh
Or see you locked for some years, but I persevere
[?] Droog cut from that old cloth, rare mesh
These smooth hands weren't made for a scuffle
I ain't gon' duff you, won't be no kerfuffle (what you doin'?)
Calling for body parts in a duffle
Right on your block the goonies air 'em with no Truffle Shuffle
Turn a stand up dude into a seat taker
Strip him, jack him for his kicks like a beatmaker
Bring his dome back home as a ornament
Semi rounds like a tournament
Running ship, I [?] so you tried to do it, but you unequipped
Like we lacking the juice, you want a sip? (Pause)
Piss on your protegees, murder your mentors
Leave 'em floating in the ocean, now they really Cement 4s
