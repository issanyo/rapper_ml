[Intro: Your Old Droog]
Do-do-do-doo (uh huh, uh huh)
Do-do-do-doo
1, 2, y'all
1, 2, y'all
Old school, y'all
New school, y'all
1, 2, y'all
1, 2, y'all
1, 2, y'all
And you don't stop
1, 2, y'all
And you don't quit
Check it

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
I'm here to make a dollar out of fifteen cent
And let my balls hang, rhyming's just a small thang
On bad days there's mad ways to get my revenue up
But don't let 'em think you nice or they're just revvin' you up
For y'all to die, it's six million ways
You little droogs still in the building phase
I'm holding down the 1 seed in the Eastern Conference
Barbed wire bars pierce the ears of anybody on the fence
To call 'em 'sleep is too kind, they in a coma
Me? I won't be shocked when my work is in the MoMA
Plus I never cared much for certification (nah)
Word to my GED and kindergarten diploma
Since then the poems is sick as lymphomas
It's wildfire missiles from my dome at your domicile
Prove your diss full of misnomers
Say I'm nothing to write home about?
Must be homeless
You really just need a couch to crash on
Hell no! Wake up one morning and the stash gone
Find out they violated your daughter
Sometimes your enemy be your biggest supporter
You just a new herb for slaughter
'Specially nowadays everyone's a scammer or extorter
Snitches, walk around with a recorder
Sounding like investigative reporters

[Bridge: Your Old Droog]
Where did you come from?
What school did you go to?
Heard you stay out in BK (that's right)
I got some people that know you (oh you know me from where?)
Said they was your classmates (man, when?)
Way back in like '02 (son, I was 12)
Doggy, I don't know you (what?)
Bitch, I don't owe you

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Pardon, you wasn't there when I was starving
Hardly amped about this future I was carving
Call me a plant 'til I'm packing out the Garden
Funny it be the cats on the bench always starting
Bunch of bums singing "gimme shelter" like Mick and Keith
I'm in this game for the chicken, fuck beef
Ain't got time to be grief-stricken, you lucky
If this was 17-year-old me you woulda got your teeth kicked in
Rather get at you in song 'cause I know that knowing better and doing wrong
Is worse than doing wrong
Can't be smart acting like your screw's loose
That's a cardinal sin, like Pujols was on the juice
Society is obtuse
Make me wanna do like Kobe, chuck the deuce
But I ain't no [?], I don't belong on a corner, son
This rap shit I was born to run, like Bruce
These other crews' careers is fake news
For hits and views, I don't appreciate your rules
Their albums drop, then come and go, like "welp"
And the weight of your collaborators' names won't help
In the top studios, everything's state-of-the-art
But I'm depressed when I think about the state of the art
Damn right I got hate in my heart
And motherfuck an audition, I ain't tryna play the part
I know that big advance from a label is just a loan
I just want the bitch in charge of publishing to let me bone
Make the whore moan and quiver, send shivers through her bones
With you she don't know why she didn't cum like Norah Jones
Just had to throw a chorus on this shit
So I could capture all the mamis' corazons
Balling on Flex like Jimmy Jones
Ain't no half stepping, I don't even like semitones
You could ask Sean Combs
I'm just the best rapper 'til G. Dep get home
Don't ever try to use my name as a stepping stone
I'm the Les Paul, you brothers is replica Epiphones
And if a needle never drops again on one of my records my rep is sown
And if another needle never drops again on one of my records my rep is sown

[Outro: Your Old Droog]
