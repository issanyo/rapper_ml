[Hook]
Good times
Are hard to come by these days

[Interlude 1]
But I have fun, sometimes
Especially when I see a dime little thing walking down the street
Scoop her up
You know how it is with bitches today

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Yo yo let me tell you all a little something what happened
Met her on the D Manhattan-bound, butt was fat and round
Her thick thighs were the perfect size, damn
So let me upgrade to tropical fantasy ass
Pharcyde: I could never let no pussy pass
Now we talkin', she tellin' me where she go to school
Gave me the Instagram so I could see more photos, cool
I was real aggressive, tryna get at her the text way
Check my Instagram and she unfollowed me the next day (damn)

[Hook]

[Interlude 2]
But I have fun, sometimes
Sometimes, just a little bit at a time
A lotta cats are freaks slipping in these streets
On public transportation, but you know how it is

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I still remember...
When she turned around and let those 34 double-D's disrespect my retinas
She had a brolic forehead but I was still sweatin' her
I'm over near C.I., she was from Far Rock'
Coulda been my Michelle and I'd-a been her Barack
This girl didn't appear to have many needs
But before she gave me the number, made sure that I didn't have any seeds
She was flowin', yo my swag was off the hinges, kid
Few days later, she says "To be honest, I'm not really interested, sorry"

[Interlude 3]
Word? Oh, word? You don't even look that good anyway
You bum-ass bitch
You stressed out, we stressed out

[Hook]

[Interlude 4]
Yo, it's hot out here
But we have fun, sometimes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck with the 8s though, the 7s
6s, 2s, ugly-ass face, fat ass
I caught her walkin' off the B1, felt like a rerun
Lookin' like she could finish a Capri Sun
With no straw and be down to go raw
(A-yo) God bless, you'd be hard-pressed to find a flaw
She got fished hook, even took the mandible claw
God's gift to mankind had me rock--you see the tan line?
Image gon' stay wit'cha boy eternally
Only problem is now it really burns when I pee (Hee!)
