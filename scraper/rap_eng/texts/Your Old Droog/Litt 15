[Hook: Wiki]
Go out on my roof
Take in the sunshine, my lungs lined
With smoke and the rum rides
Passed it to my tummy, thought it got me free
But it got me confined
I can’t see
Son’s mind, like a bum knee
Mine’s number one
He left your tongue tied
One time
Go out on my roof
Go out on my roof
I just go out on my roof
Go out on my roof

[Verse 1: Wiki]
I sit around, sip brew, say that I’m busy
Pissing off the kids that live with me
I live in a town, well, I’d say it’s a city
That’s got everything to give to me
I do get down, pray, say that I’m silly
I don’t want the bullshit to get to me
I don't want the bullshit to get to me

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Yeah, told me this was improbable
Given two options, either job or school
Said hold up, kept making these cold cuts
Ain't wanna be like that fool Abdul
Rather live like the mobsters with the gabagool
'Bout to start a horn section on the low
Got sopranos, I ain't talking bout the show
And baritone sax, sipping cognacs
I see 4 plat in the future off of these tracks, we got the ammo
Thought I was dying like "let my cameron go"
Came out with a fire flow and a slamming show
Letting this hammer blow
Still write rhymes like they gonna get heard by Sean P and Yambo
Could be on the other side of the globe
Close my eyes for a second and I'm in the store
On the final leg, in Ireland, 'bout to finish tour
Breaking world records while the Guinness pour
This was meant for, Old Droog, the resident mentor
Went from hanging in stores to doing instores
Performing outsider music in indoor stadiums
Is this the end or will I endure?

[Verse 3: Wiki]
Young Simba practicing his roar
Young contender catching an applause
But I’m dolo on my roof
It’s just the train passing that’s all
What? I liked to get gassed when I’m bored
Imagine being wrapped in velour
Feel like this shit has happened before
I’m seeing things
I’m high, putting meanings to things that don’t mean a thing
I see four empty 40’s on my floor, I need more
Fiend for roaches when the weed’s all Hocus Pocus
I see y’all smoked it, notice
So it's off to the store
I see Gill there
He work there, Junior just chill there
His whole life he still there
Nelson's saucy, In the corner brewin' his coffee
Mutters to himself about some quandary he got himself in
But no one really understands him
Wondering when that’ll be me with that wandering grin
Deli just wandering in

[Hook: Wiki]
Go out on my
Go out on my
Go out on my roof
Take in the sunshine, my lungs lined
With smoke and the rum rides
Past it to my tummy, thought it got me free
But it got me confined
I can’t see
Son's mind, like a bum knee
Mine’s number one
He left your tongue tied
One time
