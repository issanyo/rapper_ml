[Sample]
The name of the song
You ready up there?
The name of the song is..

[Bridge]
Blood, blood, blood
You're just a parasite sucking..
Blood

[Hook]
Blood
Stop My bread and you gon' shed
Blood
Have you in the hospital needing
Blood
On the streets, on the snow you'll see
Blood
Nah I ain't a crip or a
Blood
But through the years we dropped tears, sweatin'
Blood
In my veins flows ice not
Blood
To be this nice you gotta sacrifice
Blood
Sell your soul like Robert Johnson or something (who that)

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
I'm sort of like an old blues player
Guitar case in the a ride, and I stays with a slide
Dumbed down every lyric, I'm adaptin' (why?)
So it can bump in these hoods that even Eric would get clapped in
Who would've thought you'd see a car passin' blastin' the captain
Droog made it happen, where fools  be trappin'
And jewels get yapped in
Them dark blocks is where the crime blotter crew lurk
They'd rather memorize gang codes instead of school work
My droog got jumped in, told me it's my turn (what?)
I'm cutting all this class so I won't have to learn
Said you gotta scrap for 3 whole minute
Son handed me lessons, I gave 'em back like a backwood with a hole in it
Used to cop a bag of green, had females scrolling L's
I ain't talkin' 'bout the magazine
But we ain't pullin' from the same spliff
She might be herped up
I roll my own when I'm lighting that purp up
Pay a goon I just met to kill
So chill Kendall and you'll only get a Gill
I got these mash out techniques from my OG in the ville
Lil Fame: (Ayo come here let me talk to you my nigga)
Then steal, spill

[Hook]
Blood
Stop My bread and you gon' shed
Blood
Have you in the hospital needing
Blood
On the streets, on the snow you'll see
Blood
Nah I ain't a crip or a
Blood
But through the years we dropped tears, sweatin'
Blood
In my veins flows ice not
Blood
To be this nice you gotta sacrifice
Blood
Sell your soul like Robert Johnson or something (who that)

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Gotta practice an illuminati ritual
Won't do it for the skill
But I bet to get rich you will
Kill your own family member for fame
And do more foulness so they remember the name
On the low, your captain never gonna blow
Bout to set it on you, troops wanna know
What happens when you get rocked with a bottle to the side of your head
Blood shed like Children of the Corn, God bless the dead
I rock a Coogi to the show
But fuck Bill Cosby he never gave me any Jell-O dough
My man Elmo got the beats and elo for the low
Other producers can eat the yellow snow
Saw what I did with potential, that's untapped
While you stuck in that one trap, stuntin'
Puntin' off fourth down they don't wanna snap
Artists got no guns like a blunt rap
We're not from the same mold
I used to come home with bleedin' knuckles and blame it on the cold
Every week I had the studio (blood)
Now I'm on UK and Paris flights, y'all some parasites suckin'

[Hook]
Blood
Stop My bread and you gon' shed
Blood
Have you in the hospital needing
Blood
On the streets, on the snow you'll see
Blood
Nah I ain't a crip or a
Blood
But through the years we dropped tears, sweatin'
Blood
In my veins flows ice not
Blood
To be this nice you gotta sacrifice
Blood

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
We used to get herbs for they pack, make 'em cough up bud
When you thought that Newports made you cough up blood
See a lot of men fall to the powers of menthol
Try to get away like Orenthal, I did
Like the glove ain't fit, I must acquit
Every time I get the urge I just suck on a tit
Droogs don't eat the box [?]
[?] through with a chick harder to pull than American Spirits
I know broads who preach celibacy then sell pussy
In some parts of the world it's a delicacy, they slangin'
Bangin', like my son who's Hoover, damn
You drug dealin' rappers didn't move a gram
Also that conscious shit is a sham
Cats play that humble role then step to hoes like "you don't know who I am?"
When they don't, get heated and leave
The people should feel cheated and deceived
Hold up, let the beat breathe
Fuck your packin'-mad-syllables rap
I'll just start rhymin' like Busy Bee
Still get busy, B, I'm a relic
They say I sold my soul
I got no soul, how imma sell it?
