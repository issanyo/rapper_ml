[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Night and day we was in the park playin' ball
It's all we ever did ever since we was small
T-Mack had the type of game that we both wanted
But it ain't look as promisin' when your growth stunted
Still you was puttin' in work
Remember got cut from the team, you was hurt
Things got brighter when you caught a little spurt
But you still was a knucklehead doin' wild dirt
That said, on the court, you still couldn't be checked
On for the heat, tech
Went from a reject to the country's number 1 prospect
Had a good chance to get your family out the projects
Still remember when you went away to camp
Cats was excited, had the whole hood amped
From the get, jumper wet
It was damned 'til you had the game
Then it splashed in your face by a future champ
Then it seemed like your dreams got deflated
Deterred by the words, out nights gettin' faded
Took pride in bein' ignorant instead of educated
When if you kept your head on straight, you would've made it
Now this shit is dumb whack
And overweight, 30 somethin', tryna make a comeback
Draft Night all over again, sittin' round waitin'
Watchin' All Stars on the outside, hatin' like

[Hook]
Ooh, go hard, give up, give up
Ooh, go hard, give up, give up

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
There's few things that are more uglier in this world
Than an attractive girl who's cool with just bein' beautiful
Wants to be on the big screen but ain't develop any useful skills
All attempts have been futile
Don't have any real tools you can utilize
And guys just tryna smash, feedin' you the lies
That's the motto, you tried to model
But the director was brutal 'bout your size
In my eyes, you was right though
Stupid ass still went and got lipo
Self-image negative like typo
You head and gassed it, got your tits and your ass did
And your zits sandblasted
By some shady ass doctor, that bastard
Takin' thirst pics, only thing you mastered thus far
Counts all your followers, said that he can make you a star
Only good for bringin' coffee
Had your goofy ass in the booth singin' off-key
Got the opportunity to act
Was a small role, you couldn't even do that
Now you back up in the trap
Last cat that you let tap had the clap
Runnin' in place in the race, gettin' lapped
When we runnin' things, only thing you runnin' is your yap like

[Hook]
Ooh, go hard, give up, give up
Ooh, go hard, give up, give up

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
It all started with a dollar and a dream
Now you can holla, you can scream
It's not like you ain't have a good team
Fought hard to get you all the right placement
Came a long way from doin' songs in the basement
Rhymin' on public access
Lawyers close the deal, accountants do your taxes
Always had dreams of goin' to the top
10 years later and you still ain't popped
Silver platter and you still can't eat
All the hot features and mad good beats
Goin' dumb hard tryna chase a hit
In the studio with writer's block, can't pen shit
Sinkin' deep into the cesspool
Now your little man's man's more successful
First came the youth jams
They used to open up for you, now you openin' for them
Tide startin' to turn the fate
Gettin' older, you should probably learn the trade
Or work on music in a new capacity perhaps
Not everyone's supposed to rap
