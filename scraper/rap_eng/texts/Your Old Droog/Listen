[Verse 1]
Never take a break, there's cake to make
Plus I had it in the bag, since Jake the snake
Duck Jake & the snake, keep the grass cut
Look out for giants and Yankee jackets with
The cheap shades from sunglass hut, son you butt
Better yet vag, when they pull out the badge
Social ad jumps, went & got a Glock as they was punks, growing up
Feels like I'm being punk'd, but I got the shank and its long
Don't be another prank gone wrong
Bong Bong, wisdom imported from Hong Kong
You cats spitting panty lines recording thong songs
Sisqo, steady beats, disco, pigs pop in my disc
They be ready to stop and frisk
Jizzing at the thought of my imprisonment
We curved that fiend who tried to talk to us
Cause I don't know his intent, plus i seen him hopping out that van that's on the corner

[Hook]
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
You just listen to me

[Verse 2]
Rap game, sorta like wrestling I play the heel
'Cept shit is real, I'm like George 'The Animal' with the Steele
Cats hear the first verse, be like "damn, the pigs lost man"
Hanging from the top of the cell like Big Boss Man
That's what happens when you force my hands
Spend months in the crib, devising plans
'Noid, I knew there's D's in the, Verizon van
Tried to talk to me about, reggie and kush
(what you do?)
I do like Reggie Bush, give em the Heisman, fam
My black fans is really loyal, Billy Hoyle
Make that shit that white men can't bump
Brought the truth serum, you fear 'em
Fire like Jimi, you listen to Droog but y'all don't hear em
He said 'excuse me while i kiss the sky'
You herbs, thought it was 'kiss this guy' (eww)
Need to clean the wax out, leaving honeycomb on my earphones
You lames don't listen to lyrics, y'all just hear tones

[Hook]
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
You just listen to me

[Verse 3]
Focus junior, got the drop like Yokozuna
That's Banzai, no matter what they gone spy
Have the old man throw powder in ya eye
Then it stop, when i come through like Hogan with the leg drop
(Droog)
Had the nine outside like Wrestlemania 9
On the grind, defiant, getting dollars gorilla body suit
With air brush muscle like giant Gonzales
Keeping an eye out for Impalas

[Hook]
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
I know they listening (but y'all don't hear me though)
You just listen to me
