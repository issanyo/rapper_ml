I was ten years old when I first rapped on a stage
1995, way back in the days
J, Alex and I, we wrote a couple of rhymes
20 years have passed, some lines are still stuck in my mind
Used to perfect our craft every day after school
Studied 'Yo! MTV Raps!' and the way rappers moved
With 36 on cassette
Let's play back the groove
Alex was Meth, I was Raekwon, laid back and smooth
J was Gold, he had his favourite flows
Was just playin' around now I'm playing shows, that's the way it goes
The high I get on stage get me through creative lows
Give me my fix I need my daily dose
I feel like I'm more at home on stage than in real life
Calm palm on the still mic under the chill lights
Where words come rapidly, it's like I don't have to breathe
From front to back you see, it all comes naturally

When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple...

You already know how I get down, alright let's get it
Ayo, my grandma was found way before I rocked Hammerstein
Still remember when I kicked that first line
Was more battle of the narrator
Learned how to rap on a beat a year later
Shoulda been started I was part faking
Too busy watchin' chicks on the screen rumps shakin'
Close my eyes, I can see the clips still
Up nights watchin tipdrill gettin' money
Pause, [?]
Write a verse, wait let me tweak that
Came up with a punch that was so simple
Write jabs like devout jewels, they go into your temple
Super nice, too precise throwin darts
You have weight rappers want, no parts
Even had my bitch leave me cause I showed I had the passion that I did in my art, [?]

When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
Its's so simple
Its's so simple

When we first met I'd only been single for five months
Just got out of a long relationship, why front?
I was looking for sex, I wasn't looking for love
And from outta nowhere she had me hooked like a drug
So a part of me was hoping cupids gun might jam
On the run like, damn
I Haven't been on my own for six years and now unlike planned
A one night stand just might become one lifespan, man
My brain told me not to listen to my heart
To the point it had me wishing we would part
So I broke up with her, but changed my mind right away
You don't know what you got until it's gone, it's like night and day
Luckily she stuck with me
Thats when i learned the lesson not to let answers turn to questions, an eternal blessing
She took me back and when I asked her why, a fast reply "I don't let love pass me by" you know?

When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
It's so simple unlike a riddle
When I get involved I give it my heart
Its's so simple
