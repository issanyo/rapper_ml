[Verse 1]
Crash on the freeway, letting it splash
Fucking with me, better [?]
Peon, I ain’t letting that pass
I pull a Leon and get in that ass
Drop the battle, I’m winning the war
Classic album in the stores
For mixtape shit, you had to nag but you act
That’s why you ain’t put on a track
See the way I’m twisting words
Flow so unorthodox, you doing it for the nerds
I do it for them blocks, they only bump us in the Lox
At the corner store with the aux next to the hostess brand cakes
Doing indigenous handshakes
We’re talking bloods and crips
Christians, Jews, Muslims
Sunnis and Shi’ites, saw your girl, she aight
You had to flee the fight, guess you chose flight
3D Doritos, Remix Sprite
03 blackout, when these people gone see the light?

[Verse 2]
Came out the game with that heat rock
You pussy are getting treated for shock
No rubber, I’m one of the rawest
She love [?] what’s the fuss for
Got a problem with me?
You can reach me at 1 800 hustler
I was all over J records, your career dwindled on J records
That ain’t even a shot to Kass
Cause casualties slay, and cats who can freestyle all day
But their songs are trash
That will never thump, it’s like cocaine
Why give em a line if you can give em something to bump
Feel me?

[Verse 3]
Lookie here, I could tell you I don’t do a Capella
Give me a track to bash, burn, held up and thrash
Make it feel like a semi just crashed
80 car pile up, been doing this since dial up
Not the cat you want to rile up
Cause I can and will pull your file up
It’s on pile up, eating the beat like a bacon wrap
Bar face scallop, then we hit the stripper [?]
Get a gal up on the pole like the Gallop Poll
Just sit back while I run shit man
You pundits know your role
‘Fore I send you to the black hole
That’s the boy
The illest flow since Freeway
With punchlines like Fabin Lloyd
Don’t even got to get dissed to get destroyed
Your overjoyed, and by the way how’s your hemorrhoids?
