[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Old Droog keep a fly bunny
On a leash like bitch better have my money
Your girl smoke Newports and sound wild funny
Voice deeper than I-20's
Vocal cords be disturbin' the peace
Motherfucker, you's a herb in the East
Heard they 'bout to do you like ching-a-ling
Try to say that your girl got a dingaling
Hee-shee, Blowticious
What do you know, the flow is so vicious
Cause I'm hungry, the crib got no dishes
No saltwater tank, no fishes
Only swedish ones from the corner store
I was born to poor parents who wanted more
American dream
Here I am spittin' dope rhymes that are never generic in theme
And when they are, beats, still clean
Go flex on 'em, mean
All around the world I've seen women fiend
Woke numbers, that Gene Simmons gene
Joints out in Pasadena
Wash Heights homes who still bump "Gasolina"
More freaks than the week they tried to cast "Selena"

[Hook: Your Old Droog]
More than just a hood star, call me Mr. Goodbar
Listen close you'll find something really good in every bar

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
Any time that your hear a Droog rhyme I drop zingers
No more mob ringers, but he lingers
Where fiends still cop from slingers
Crackheads got pipes like opera singers
Former drug dealers to the stars
Are now owners of motherfuckin' juice bars
Some still sell, they go back
Sold that boy [?]
Y'all cats are so whack
And I'm iller with the pen than the Zodiac killer
Phyllis, like Dilla
I'm talkin' Jay Dee and that old lady, it's no one realer
Stayin' the same, I already got the best wordplay in the game
And the metaphors - they don't even comprende those
These pendejos should pay me to pen they flows
I hook 'em up - literally with choruses
Smoke verses, and I burn bridges like self-sabotage
Even on Sabbath we charge
Sunday I have a menage
Givin' me shine is one thing they got right
Fuck the game, thrust into the spotlight
Think I'm in it for the fame? Not quite

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
Bo Garden like Biggavel', no pardon
Go hard in the paint
I'm focused on the universe in my reach
Y'all cats is thirstin', all you do is reach
Easily replaceable
You got bars, well I got suitcases full
Used to keep a book just for punchlines
Right next to the Big L and Pun shrine
Fresh chucks and a Pelle clean
For gettin' biz, I'm notorious
Crush you like a jelly bean
My shit early L.L. mean, you rock L.L. Bean
We dipped in Ferragam'
Pay stacks, lay back with an air of calm
Writin' rhymes in the crib with a [?]

[Hook]
