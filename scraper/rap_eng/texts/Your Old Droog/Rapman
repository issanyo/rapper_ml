Rapman, protecting all the Land from New York to Japan
Hes the one no villain can escape
Superhero with a cape and a mixtape (what's his name?)
Rapman, tinted Cartiers with a studio tan
Work ethic of a Mexican
And the Rap-mobile's an electric van
Yo check it

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
Storming through like a panther with a black fist
Scatting, combatting all the whackness
These dudes ain't MCs, they're good actors
Who too quick to succeed, need practice
Lock them in a room with The Cactus Album and some Follow the Leader, Rakim
You know I be out late fighting the crime of rappers not writing their rhymes
Teaching them how to be a better beat picker
Get albums done and come out with heat quicker
Yo I'm sick of these sychophants that want make their idols proud
I want my hero to hear me and shit his pants
Rewind what I said
Writing in my durag that keep lines in my head
Prevents me from penning hot trash and
Keeps the focus on the music, not fashion
Grab the microphone and voice issues
Lot of brothers tunes sounding like moist tissues
Laugh at where the cats are taking the sounds
Every bar tender - that's why they making the rounds (listen)
They a joke do track
I'm hunting down every cat spewing that coke rap
With that fake-ass drug dealer image they try and portray
Even John'll tell you that ain't your forte
Not letting it fly
Plus you got chumps talking that third eye crap and getting high
Punks, making themselves hot
Burning in public like Vietnamese monks
Peddling junk
I invade the tour bus, snatch them out of they bunks
Hang up the dunks
Every single rapper spitting that forthright
Turn off their mics, they need to be more like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
The JO is really heavy man
So I lay low, play the every man, stay to myself
'Cause people too nosy
But still nobody knows what I do like Jarobi
My work pissing off the po-po
But its dope though
Manage to keep a low pro
Say goodnight to my white neighbors
They go inside and rhyme fight with light sabers
Break them down to the molecules
Show what they all about cheddar chunks and [?] jewels
Preaching the gospel
To think that I used to twist spliffs
Causing mischief in high school
Gangs was my kryptonite
Like son, how you a Blood this morning and turn crip tonight?
Flipping white, hash, pills, and chronic
Would go to DC but not for comics
Prior to getting clean I was an addict: a fiend
Now I'm healthy and the diet is mad strict
Making green drinks, eating a tangerine
Trying to wean zombies off xans and lean
Forced to deal with all this anguish
Dudes mumbling - sound like they rapping in a different language
I have them enunciate every vowel and
Make the old washed up rappers throw the towel in
And those doing weaker versions of what's already been done before
Fill they backpacks with C4
Your beef is yours
I'm over here fighting a bigger war against Lex Leor
Hop in a ride quick with my Sidekick
Breezing by, blasting Aquemini
I been the guy
You already know when you see that microphone signal in the sky
