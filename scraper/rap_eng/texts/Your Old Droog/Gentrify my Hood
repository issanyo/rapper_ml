[Verse 1]
Already had the luxury of buyin' loose Backwoods
What I really need is a coffee shop in my hood
Now that I ain't doing drugs
It's strictly that black water in my mugs
The bodegas only make one little pot
That be there all day, I donÂ’t care if it's still hot
Straight nil not
While the places that I go record at got all the ill spots

[Hook]
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood

[Verse 2]
Ayo Skizz bring the horns in
For that cute ass barista with the horn-rimmed glasses
Shorty look like Lisa Lo
Wish it was by my crib so I could walk up in there in a robe
But nah, all I got is four grocery stores close to me
And I just buy hoagies from there mostly
Play the house like Pelosi
Hit the staircase to roll dice with my broski
For a C note or less
Gentrify my hood, this the keynote address
The coffee spots downtown are the best
I'm over here near the last stop, express

[Hook]
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood (Gentrify my hood)
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood

[Verse 3]
Still the top struggle
Who got a raw aura, your style is a horror
Your style's more like Laura, and I'm a G
Still transfer for the G, at Lorimer
Just started goin' to Williamsburg two years ago
Introduce South Brooklyn to anyone who hears the flow
Real talk, I'm your hero
With ill freestyles since AOL free trials and NetZero
NetScape, I need love on the cassette tape
Imported from the Ukraine, right aboard the Q train
They wanna know what part of CI Droog stays in
Right on the edge, borderline Gravesend

[Hook]
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood (Gentrify my hood)
Gentrify my hood, my hood
Gentrify my hood

[Outro]
