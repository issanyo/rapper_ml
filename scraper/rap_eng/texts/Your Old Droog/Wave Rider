[Hook]
Look at you riding the wave
Don’t even know how to behave
Soon as some hot shit pop, you’re riding the wave
Just ri-ri-ri-ri-riding the wave, wave rider
To all that new dope, you’re a slave
And you’re taking that shit to your grave
You’re a wave rider, just riding the wave

[Verse 1]
Biggest wave rider on Earth, don’t get earthed
I know where to catch you by the surf and turf
You got a wave though, for whatever it’s worth
Such a cheerleader, you probably smacked the doctor’s ass at your birth (good job doc)
Like good shit, I remember you used to be our little brother, now it’s strictly hood shit
On some, first you drink Snapple’s now you sipping Mojos, on that backpack steez
Now you tipping slow, got on some smart shit once but I never was a geek
Still say boom when I tell a story, clap my hands when I speak
You just talking greasy, your rhymes is filled with mad lying, you gotta take it easy
Only drop subtle hints, say “Droog now that you got a wave, what’s on your rider?"
Condiments, condoms and mints, tight security, for all these social climbers at events

[Hook]
Look at you riding the wave
Don’t even know how to behave
Soon as some hot shit pop, you’re riding the wave
Just ri-ri-ri-ri-riding the wave, wave rider
To all that new dope, you’re a slave
And you’re taking that shit to your grave
You’re a wave rider, just riding the wave

[Verse 2]
Clowns be on the net surfing for that new hot shit
Looking for something that has ‘it’ well Droog got it
The kid wrote rhymes every day sitting next to an Asian bitch on the train rocking USBA
Herbs talking on that [?] instead of taking the time to create their own wave they rather ride mine
Focus on making a hot song, you worried about what I got on
That’s why you not on, I don’t care how I look long as the rhymes are tight
Timbs so busted I don’t know what the new ones supposed to look like
That’s why I’m the fucking king of New York
Try to ride my wave, get your brains splattered on the sidewalk
Monsoon, I always said that I would be on soon
Side clone, no more riding past the cyclone
On the Q, little boy blew up, got more than a wave, a sea, just ask Sue

[Hook]
Look at you riding the wave

To all that new dope, you’re a slave

You’re a wave rider, just riding the wave

[Verse 3]
Am I the best? Si, and I sigh cause I’m stressed
Cats hit me like "congrats on the recent success" (thank you, thank you)
Do no press, but I get the most press
Smashing shorties, coffee cakes, and I still bag the hostess
Hollering at freaks from Skizz's passenger seat ‘bout to get on some Sporty Thievz
Making fun of shorties' weaves, never run out of material
Cause I’m still a fan, how I got the game locked in a serial killer van
'Bout to silence them yams with stans riding for your boy like a rabid J. Dilla fan
Really the man, I’m probably the first rapper to decline a damn stimulus plan
It’s not just Droog son, it’s more like a band, built a brand cause my tape hard
Now my shit is everywhere, you can’t escape YOD
Going ape y'all, feels like we back in Cape Cod
