[Verse 1]
It’s Droog
The hidden persuader, the purse raider
Come up with a hot line and finish a verse later
Get to get to it, got a lot of stuff on my mind
Doing everything your Droog even tried to meditation crime
To maintain
Maybe I’ll become a fitness instructor, takeover Jack LaLanne lane
Workout, spend the next day in pain
Go hard for a few weeks then invariably the interests start to wane
Still spitting butane on the Q train, fresh from the Ukraine
How ‘bout had a whole collection of red wraps and a brain
That’s why my project dropped and hit the city harder than collapsin' cranes
The old scriptures is more advanced than [?]
Y’all might as well be criss-crossed with your pants backwards
Not a doubt in my mind as single sells
Still take the train back from the lab and get off at steel well
I stay determined waited, putting in work before the terminal hotel sign got terminated
Got my shit permeated, the game, over beats that remind me of my [?] baby
You still selling, but I ain't buying it, or renting

[Hook]
We’re not buying your bullshit, darling
We don’t buy it at all
Not renting it either baby (not with my hard earned money)
You get nothing at all

[Verse 2]
I’m not stupid!
Despite the fact that I may play the ignoramus
Asking where the hoes at and grab the tit and torch was glamorous
Hammer this into your skull I’m not buying it
You’ll never change that but I stop trying
Hipsters mistake my true feelings for sarcasm and irony
I want my name up it lights like N-I-N-E
That why I pump rhymes like foreign [?]
In a major or minor key
Kiko don’t screw with the ecosystem
Just got word from T-Ray from the freak show, we about to enlist them
Craft the unique flow, over Tiko Tiko
Dumb it down if it’s a little too chique for you Chico
After that, getting up with The Alchemist
Watch Alan [?] make a classic album
Rap camp counsellor, got my whistle and shit
Had a rocket like summer youth and job corps fuck I need a job for?
[?]
They want me to be the next Eminem
Like I’m not already platinum on M&N
With Jay [?]
Shouts to Authentic I’ve never bought a beat in my life

[Hook]
We’re not buying your bullshit, darling
We don’t buy it at all
Not renting it either baby (not with my hard earned money)
You get nothing at all
