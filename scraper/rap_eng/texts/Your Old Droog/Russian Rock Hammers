[Verse 1: Solace]
We out for that...
Mad money like Jim Cramer, we bring flavor
The fruits of my skilled labor reveal traitors
Feed'em to the gators the Judas that betrayed us
Enslaved us, rap liberator here to save us
Flyer than an invite from Buddy Esquire
I'm the Sire, like Jeffry Bolkiah, gets higher
Save the seniority speech, you gets fired
Firearms hold the code of the streets it gets liver
Damage to the liver, the slander they deliver
Will drop'em in a river
And watch'em try to swim up
My nomenclature defies the force of nature
Darts outline your movements and trap your shape up
Razor struck, laser cut
Scratch a diamond with a diamond
The whole Q borough stand beside my while I'm rhymin'
I chime in to let'em know that I'm in
Russian rock hammers chisel glaciers that I'm climbin'
Pay for premium get  you high like helium
Rock my J's unlaced you never see me run.... son

[Verse 2: Oprime39]
The king of the wild East
Foul speech gun in your mouthpiece
I take the L if you make it to round 3
I'm all around Queens
Like jums around fiends
Give the drummer some
We number one its all about cream
The cash cal smack clowns born to never back down
Wise guys said it's your time, you gotta act now
The Ray Liotta coke look with the baggy eyes
Sparking izm like we Channel Live
Broadcasting verbal homicides live on Channel 5
45 from Arizona call it Channing Frye
Passing by Beach Channel drive to Kennedy Fried
In the streets with pride keep the energy live
Better be wise... I"m reading minds like Professor X
Intelligence, my sentiment's ain't no comparing this
Excellence unless you suicidal
On this Bible bout to show you what we do to rivals
An overdue arrival, but we here to stay
Brujeria wordplay to make you dissipate
Grand Marnier, 20/20 through the Cartiers
Tie my hands to my back to play it fair, yeah...


[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]
Dump more lead than Zepplin when we reppin
Almost white as Jimmy Page they like
"I thought you were black dog!"
Some even swore I was Dominican
But it dont' matter whether your old pal is Indian or Palestinian
Cuz we still separate Church from State
Breaking more necks than Tekken in fact checkin'
This is real rap journalism
A stupid person try to overstand this wisdom catch an aneurysm
That's why I do the knowledge in the calm manner
Ever since middle school when you had a planner
Ruthless when I bless the booth the best rhymer
Delivering the truth like Ruth Westheimer
Sex advise extra nice introducing words into the lexicon
Gassin' hoes I even put me ex on
Lil bad dyslexic Mexican jawn
With the ring in the septum
I used to send letters her way but the ugly ass friend would intercept them
But the ones she got, she kept'em
I post up outside and smoke a BD this other chick bump my shit so hard her man broke the CD
