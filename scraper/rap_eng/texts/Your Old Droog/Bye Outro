[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I bare my soul, how I'm gon' wear my gold?
How I'm gon' wear this gear? And wristwear?
And although it's gotten monotonous here
Still steppin' in hot to this year
Like Mohamed Atta this year
Handle the mic like Martin Bashir
Get my pack of Winstons, black coffee, peacoat
And I'm outta here

[Outro: Sample]
Bye
