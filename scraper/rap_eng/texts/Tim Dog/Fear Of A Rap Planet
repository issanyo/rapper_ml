[Chorus]

Fear of a rap planet x2

[Verse One]

Shot rang out
Cops came out
To stop the party in the Bronx
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
False alarm
No one was hurt
But the cops still grabbed my arm and threw me down
He said, Keep still nigga
Don't make a sound
Before I let this .38 [?]
See, they ain't like the way we jam in the park
Lemme take you way back to the start
See, they wouldn't let us jam in thier disco spots
And they wouldn't give us jobs in thier record shops
What they want to do is stop us from uniting together
Rather see us robbing and stealing and killing each other
Tour man named Bam from Zulu Nation
Showed us how we can form an [?] interregation
If you black, Hispanic, Caucasian or Asian
If it's under hip-hop, we'll be one nation
Now it ain't like [?] buff we was trying to create
So they sent some house niggas to infiltrate
They made them execs
They made them rich
As soon as we got power, the mother fuckers switched
We went from I got dough to
I got gold to
I'm going platinum I drive Rolls to
Made my Benz and I got shows to
Now I ain't got no mother fucking control

[Chorus]

Fear of a rap planet x2

[Verse two]

Now Jay-Z and Little Wayne and Eminem
Help run the game
Three house niggas running the plantation
All you hear on your fucking radio station
Is it their fault or our fault?
No stores that sell
No records bought
Now i-Tunes is on the scene
And every rapper's getting fucked with no Vaseline
They don't do no marketing or compliment
All they do is upload you for thirty percent
Make you wait a whole year just to get your check
I know a lot of platinum rappers living back in the 'jects
Makes me so mad
Wanna pick up a Tech
Bitch won't give me ass
I can't pick up a check
Rappers are brand new won't give me respect
To many country ass niggas with no intellect
But if I stab
And if I blast
The cops will come
And lock my ass
{?] And you will lav
But why you laugh
I don't come to Popeye's and fuck with your cash
It ain't easy
Please believe me
Niggas got rap legends feeling like they're needy
All you rappers at the top of the charts
I got one question
Why you scared of us?

[Tim Dog ad lib]

Ya'll scared?
Ya'll scared of hip-hop?
Hip-hop can unify the world
Hip-hop got more power than the government
That's why you're all scared
Cause rap music is for everybody
And ya'll scared of that
Rap legacy!
