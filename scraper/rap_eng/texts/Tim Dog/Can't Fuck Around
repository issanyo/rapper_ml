[Various ad lib]

[Intro- Dialogue: Ced Gee]
Hey yo, Dog man what's up with that, man?
Brothers out here say you ain't got no metaphor
What's up with that shit man?
Yo, you better flow man
I want to hear them funky rhymes you fucking got
Word, G
Go for yours

[Verse 1: Tim Dog]
Suffering succotash
I'll harass and whip another rapper's ass fast
If he try to get past
My hard core rhythm addict, words of metaphor
My rhymes are better for, so go ahead and let it pour
You be waiting for a rapper just like me
Tim Dog, D-O-G
So get up, sit down, matter of fact, step off
Your soft, your just like a cold with a cough
You need to be cured and re-insured
And what you may seem to be
But let's see
Forget it punk, you're just dying
If you don't have the talent, there's no sense in trying
Try and defeat me, can't compete with me
Cheat me, treat me bad or just damn beat me
But it won't work
The Dog is no joke
All your ideas are up in smoke
It's realistic, to bad you missed it
Somethings in my pants, jumping down and kiss it
Call me your papa, daddy, honorable father
But diss Tim Dog, why bother?

[Hook]
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around

[Verse 2]
Roll the dice, cracked, hot damn
I'm not who you think I am
I don't need a cane, cause I don't limp
Tim Dog's a pimp and not a wimp
He's a subject matter without the chit chatter
You're looking at a brother that's badder
To manifest, guess the rest at best
Put up a test, yes and watch a sucker ass 'fess
I'm the man and all girls love me
Fuck around, will try to be above me
You want to play me like I ought to be taught?
Remember, I ain't taking no shorts
I'm gonna get mine and you get yours
And just cause you're girl want to give me some drawers
Don't get mad and try to give me some static
My posse is thick and automatic
What I got bringing up the force
My brother L-King leading of the source
And Ced Gee with a nine in hand
The suckers out there don't understand
Yo, that I committed, rhymes get with it
Suckers try to get it, but they can fit it
I flow like a river, rhymes I deliver, make emcees shiver
Who, who, who, and I give ya
A devastating rhyme that is good to go
Fuck with the Dog, you just don't know
I crush and must, I bust the fuss, disgust to hust
Think you're better than Dog you're on dust
Ballistic, mystic, gifted, twisted, shifted, lifted
Slop ya like I'm serving a biscuit
I'll cruise right by you, playa
And I'll return like a son of a Jedi
You get smashed and crashed in a flash
Boom, bash, you know that ass won't last

[Hook]
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around

[Verse 3]
Super superb, mass hysteria, worry a harrier
My rhymes deliver you like a messenger carrier
Double ya and start scheme and beam and redeem
A technique to mixes, I'm creaming
Motivate and ill innovate, participate
Goddamn, it's time to eliminate
Coo-coo for Cocoa puffs, eat your Rice Krispies
Turn to the Hulk for my man Bill Bixby
Flame on, turn into the Human Torch
Scorch, drinking lemonade on a porch
Trust in God, you're not hard
Get a body guard, I'll pull a card
And faking niggas get scarred

[Hook]
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
You can't fuck around
