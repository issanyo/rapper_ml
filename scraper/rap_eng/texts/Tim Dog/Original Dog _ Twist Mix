Yo, get me baby I'm hot!
Oh my God!

[Tim Dog ad lib]

[Verse 1]
You ain't in the struggle if you don't have pain
You don't know Hip-Hop if you don't know Kane
You ain't original with dog in your name
Young rappers should be all ashamed
Step back and hush up
It's the big dog from the set
Maximus Aurelius from the projects
BX
It's the return of the gladiator
I ain't leave the scene if ya feel what I mean
Laid back in the cut, just watched the game
While you young wack rappers just ran with the name
Ran with the name, plus ran with the fame
You all sound lame cause you all sound the same
So the Dog just ran to a plane
Came back to the game just to clear my name
Tim Dog
Mother fucker go spell it
Later you bitch gonna yell it (ugh!)
What?

[Chorus]
You know the cat from eighty-eight
Made the record "Chorus Line" and it still sound great
You know the cat from ninety-one
Made "Fuck Compton"
Had the whole world shook, son
You know the cat from ninety-four
Caught wreck with K.R.S. and I'm still catching wreck
What?
You know the cat-
Fuck it I'm not a cat
I'm the T.I.M. D.O.G. original Dog

[Verse 2]
Monster, hustler, pimp, duster
Come short with my paper, mother fucker I touch ya
You bring your man and I'll bring the nuts
Put holes in the side of that Bentley truck
I don't give a fuck
You niggas bow down when you see me
T.I.M., nigga D.O.G
Tim Dog
You heard the name and the hook
I'm the one that had Snoop Dogg shook
Scared Dr. Dre and brought the end to N.W.A
Got a whole fucking city trying to kill me today
I'm the real radda da cause I live in L.A
So none of yall niggas got shit to say
So fuck your interviews and your radio play
You ain't know me yesterday but you love me today
And you cornball rappers want to keep it real
Give a fuck about a deal
I'm just in it for the meal
What?

[Chorus]

[Ad lib]
After fifteen years in this business (yea?)
One thing always remain constant (what's that, Dog?)
The industry is fucking wack
Yea!

[Verse 3]
You want to know something that's funny
Why nigga go platinum, he ain't got no money?
Why nigga got game, he ain't got no honey?
Why you like my chain, wanna take shit from me?
Why you want to see the nine take two in your tummy?
Hey, fucking with your mystics
Little ass rich bitch kids
Trying to fuck with the richness
But this hardcore shit is a sickness
I bare witness
If you ain't down with the Tim Dog shit
Yall can gnaw on your dick bitch
Make sure you remember the name
Cause I'm back to rewind the game

[Chorus]

[Ad lib]
