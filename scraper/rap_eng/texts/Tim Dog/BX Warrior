Chorus:
He's a BX Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior x4

I carry the weight you niggas is scared to touch
I fought in a war
You niggas is scared as fuck
I paid my dues and rapped for free
Ain't nobody held it down for the east like the d.o.g
Snoop took the name
X took the bark
Next nigga take my shit going to lay in the park
That's my word
So go tell your man what you heard
Tell them Dog is back and he's rhyming absurd
Fuck running with 50 niggas that talk too much
Rather buy a hundred shells that don't cost too much
Hit all y'all niggas
Spit one for all y'all niggas
Fuck with Tim Dog you going to fall young nigga
I don't give a fuck about your block or your label
Or your gear, but your bitch can come here
I'm a fifteen year vet
That means I don't sweat
When I look around the game I see no threat
Point him out
Who's on top
Who got the crown
Rap shit, street shit
I'll still shut him down
Niggas always say "Why you mad, B?"
I look around the game and see all these tragedies
These Hollywood rappers and studio wanksters
With false identities never giving a thanks to
To rappers who paid your dues to cause
Oh bye the way, fuck the Source
Dave Mays used to be my brother
Lost respect when you put Martin Lawrence on the cover
What the fuck is that?
That's not Hip-Hop
It's got to stop, nigga
It's got to stop
You want to know the true meaning of Hip-Hop?
KRS, Biggie Smalls, Public Enemy and Pac
And some of you rappers got me shocked
How you let the record company run this spot
Rakim taught knowledge of self
Dr. Dre, greedy bastard didn't share the wealth
And Russell Simmons got a billion for Def Jam
And still won't give Nice and Smooth a hand
Fuck it
Give us fifty grand
Help us make a plan
Watch us take back our music from the fucking man
What you run with Stan?
Rather hang with Shady
Eminem the best rapper, are you crazy?
But that's what they do to rattle a brother
Make 50 and Ja try to battle each other
And just when we about to go to war
Jimmy Iovine is taking over y'all
You don't believe me?
Well check the stats
You ain't feeling me?
I state the facts
Farrakhan held a meeting to settle the rap war
But no one showed up to settle the black war
Everybody's to concerned with what we say in our rhyme
But no one give a damn about a child with a nine
You're all being controlled by the deaf and the blind
You call it the government
I call it house of swine
When my album drop, I bet you try to take mine
But I'm going out like them kids from Columbine
Here's the bottom line
We're running out of time
Bush don't give a fuck about yours and mine
He control you motherfuckers like telekinesis
Through you plaques, through your phantoms and your Jesus pieces
And now we're consumed with diseases
I lost my uncle to aids and my father to cancer
And you ain't got no money for an answer
But you got money for your mansion
Government expansion and advances
You got money to attack in Iraq
Then bring the all back nigga that's wack
Here's more to the fact and more to the stack
The military recruits more of us blacks
We stand in the front line
And bleed in the streets
And we come back home with nothing to eat
And y'all niggas got the nerve to criticize me
From what I say in a record
You don't like it, don't buy it
But stepping to me, don't try it
Cause if I die, I'm going to die on my own two feet
And if I die it ain't going to be for free
So fuck you pay me
