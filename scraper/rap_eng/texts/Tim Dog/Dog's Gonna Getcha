[Intro: Tim Dog]
Yeah x 3

[Verse 1: Tim Dog]
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up
Pick of another wack punk then stick 'em up, vick 'em up
Suckers get in my way
I don't play, so you're gonna get slayed
You wanna come and come and come and come
Come on bum and come and get some
You know who the fuck I am?
Goddamn! Gimme a hand
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
With a lyrical hardcore plan goddamn!
Suckers wanna take me out, break me out
They can't make me out
To be another wack emcee, cause that's garbage!
Tim Dog ain't goin out like that, black!
Matter of fact, come back
I'll be waiting with a baseball bat!
I'mma smack you in the dome
And I'mma send ya ass back home
I just want you to get the picture
The Dog's gonna getcha!

[Hook 1: Tim Dog]
Yeeeaah! x 7

[Verse 2: Tim Dog]
Use me, confuse me
You must be stupid!
Sniffin' dope, smokin' crack
I can never ever be wack, ain't that right, black?
Cause I'm the Dog baby baby
The Dog baby baby, the Dog baby baby
The Dog baby baby, the Dog baby baby
The Dog! I'm Tim Dog!
Freddy Krueger can't fuck with me
And I'm starring in Halloween 3!
Beware you wack emcees!
Bow down to your motherfucking knees
You gotta get the picture!
That the Dog's gonna getcha!

[Hook 2: Tim Dog]
Yeeeaah! x 3

[Verse 3: Tim Dog]
Ah! I can't believe how dope I am
I'm the motherfucking man
Smacking emcees with one hand
Don't cry, ya little bitch! Be a man!
Do what you got to do, Learn what you got to learn
It's your concern
But if you're wack, I'mma come and getcha!
Cause the Dog's gonna getcha!

[Hook 3: Tim Dog]
Yeeeaah! x 5

[Outro]
I'ma getcha! x 4
I, am, gonna, getcha!
Yeah!
