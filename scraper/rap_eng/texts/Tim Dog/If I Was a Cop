I don't give a fuck about the nigga sellin' crack
All I know, he better put some back
Robbin' the community, yo that's whack
You robbin' a Benz? You're gonna get jacked
If I was a cop I wouldn't fuck with Gotti
I'd fuck with Clinton and the congress party
If I was a cop I'd take from the rich
Give to the poor 'cause life's a bitch
If I was a cop I'd steal from the Italian
Go in the projects and unload by the batallion
If I was a cop, i'd take from you
You and you and you and you and you
'Cause bein' a cop now a days is no joke
Ya gotta be careful, ya might get smoked
People gettin' tired of playing cops games
Guilty, first thing they bash in your brains
Isn't it a shame that blacks feel the pain
And all these years ain't a damn thing changed
If I was a cop, I'd fight to strike back
Return of the Jedi, return of the black, jack
Yeah with this track I'm gettin' wicked
And all you dirty cops know where you can stick it

(CHORUS)
"Sawed off shotgun hand on the pump"
If I was a cop, if I was a cop I'd have a
"Sawed off shotgun hand on the pump"
If I was a cop, if I was a cop
"Sawed off shotgun hand on the pump"
If I was a cop, if I was a cop I'd have a
"Sawed off shotgun hand on the pump"
If I was a cop, if I was a cop, pop pop

If I was a cop I'd keep my head under block
A sucker tried to flip he'd get dropped
Bang, zoom, assume the position
If ya try ta run I got plenty ammunition
I stickin' up crooked cops like I'm down with the swat
Pop goes the nine, ya motherfuckin' swine
'Cause I'm takin' 'em out
Crooked cops is somethin' we can do without
Ya know you crooked ass crooks
The dirty motherfuckers, they just got off the hook
And all you judges on the bench
You're so fulla shit I can't stand the stench
To catch a few a them would be a plus
We'll hang them motherfuckers like they always hangin' us
'Cause if I was a cop, my people would survive
Work out like Jesse to keep peeps alive
Karim Abdul, Muhammad, and Louis Farrakhan
The ministers for the nation of Islam
Fuck Tipper Gore and what she stands for
Position when I reckon, position in the poor

(CHORUS)

"Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump"(repeated)
