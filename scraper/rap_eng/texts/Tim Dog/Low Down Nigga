This means war, suckas ya got static
Tim Dog is back to put the wack in check

Breakin em down to they motherfuckin knees
I got loads a rhyme loads a time, goin for mine
And I'm even droppin dimes
Cause I have a quest for
To make wack MCs once who tried to get more
But how could you get more out
When you're just a motherfuckin sell out
Come back get real learn ya trade
Rap is an art not a source to get paid
But you wanna get bigger
You wanna be a mack when you're a low down nigga
So I'm gonna wax that ass
Takin motherfuckers back to class
I'm Dog dissin wack niggas on wax
Whether you're old or new jacks
You can be a nigga with an attitude
But when I spank that ass you'll have gratitude
The Dog'll be smackin em up
Yeah, backin em up
Get up get down come and get yours
And if you're ready for a hardcore chore
Just come right down the 3rd lane

I'm unequvilble lyrical mysterical difficult
Hypethetical miracle
Alphabetical order sorter caught her
Brought her daughter you can't afforda
Rhyme like this cause you know you done missed
So when you need someone to follow after
Just come to the hardcore master
Damn flippin like pancakes
Stompin em out with my big Northlakes
You wanna be bigger
