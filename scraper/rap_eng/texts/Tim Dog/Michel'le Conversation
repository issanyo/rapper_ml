[Tim Dog]
Yeah man, I was fucking this bitch last night

[Voice 1]
Yeah?

T: Bitch pussy felt like velvet, man
V: Fuck outta here, man
T: Yeah, I was fuckin' her
I must have went a good 35 minutes
V: Yeah?
T: Hard strokes, before I even bust my first nut, man
V: Damn
T: That shit was awesome
*Phone ringing*
Hey M-O, get that for me
V: Hello?

[Michel'le]
Yeah, let me speak to Tim Dog
V: Alright, who is this?
M: This is Michel'le
V: Alright, hold on
Yo, this is Michel'le
T: Word?
Yeah, who this?
M: Yo, this is Michel'le and I don't appreciate the way
You were talkin' about me on your record
I don't think it was very funny the way you disrespect
Women and all, it's not cool

T: Yo baby, let me tell you something
First of all, I ain't diss you personally
I was dissin' your man, 'cause everybody know
Your man is a pussy, fuckin' that beef, and pump it up
You know, so I had to diss you
And that's what it takes, you know
I mean, be realistic
He's, like, real fucked up
I know he hit on you, so you can't even find that
So that's why i'm steppin' to him
I'm tryin' to be a man, and beat up on a man
Know what i'm sayin'?

M: Yeah, well I see what you mean
Now i'm tired of him beatin' on me
If he keeps it up, i'm gonna be rockin' with you, Tim Dog

T: A'ight, baby, see yo, peace out
