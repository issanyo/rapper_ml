[Tim Dog Various Ad lib]

[Verse one]

I give a fuck about the next nigga
I'm in the game for the check and the sex nigga
You think you hard when they calling you the best nigga?
Put that Tec to ya neck
Get out the Lex nigga
Driving down the boulevard in BX nigga?
Fuck your bitches
Send your ass home wet, nigga
Ill niggas from the projects
Little niggas carry Macs and Tecs
Homicidal for respect
With bigger hearts than King Kong
Kill a mother fucker on spites the theme song
For having that bling on
New York city streets is worse than Vietnam
Ring the alarm
Tim Dog is back
All you bitches get naked
All you niggas stay strapped
I ain't KRS, but it's return of the boom bap
Niggas talk shit get a hole in the fitted cap
Just like that
Just like this
Give a fuck about your feeling
Nigga suck my dick
All you faggot ass DJs won't play my joint
I ain't gonna talk
I'll let the nine prove my point
And you cornball rappers wanna do a duet
Nigga bring you bitch and bring your check
How you been in the game for a year and you a vet?
When I look on the charts I don't see no threat
The most hated emcee
Even hated by my brother
Fuck the source
They can keep the cover
I'm the illest nigga alive
"Why?" you say
I dissed the west coast and I moved to L.A
Yea!
I don't give a fuck mother fucker
I spit bombs
Niggas got beef with Dog
Shits on
We can throw hands or bottles or shoot guns
Niggas want to keep it on the stage and spit one
But I gotta tell you when your ass is done
I'm a burn emcees like the sun
Ya'll niggas better run
When Tim Dog come to gun
I be dissing emcees for fun

[Verse two]

A lot of niggas be biting shit
They run around in the game like they mother fucking nice and shit
Everybody know where Snoop got the D-O-G
And niggas know DMX got the bark from me
But you all want to say I hate
Check my resume bitch
Go back to '88
First Dog in the game
First Dog with the name
First up in the bitch
I'm in the Hall of Fame
You in the Hall of Shame
Ya all the same
While I was born to fam
I'm in the Hall of Game
Ya'll some mother fucking swagger-jackers
Running after the sales of these crackers
And these fucking backpackers
And now you want to hate on me
Mark my words nigga
I'm the original D-O-G
I'm the sickest nigga
Got the baddest bitches, nigga
Niggas hire me for dissing
Cause I'm quick to diss a nigga
And quick to stick a nigga for his fucking riches, nigga
Digging on your fucking grave
Make you shit your britches, nigga
I rain on you niggas to hurt you
Nigga i ain't drunk of the Cristal
High off the purple
I'm focused, man
And I'm hungry as fuck
And you faggot ass rappers done pushed your luck
I'm a get you for your jewels
And get you for your truck
I'm a get you till your very last God damn buck
And show the industry that your wack as fuck
BX mother fucker
What's up?

[Verse three]

Up town niggas are the craziest
West side niggas are the craziest
South Bronx niggas are the craziest
From Hunts Point to Co-op
We invented Hip-Hop
BX and we ain't gonna stop
Our body guard's a Glock and not a cop
Our rhymes are hot, your rhymes is not
Ya'll mother fuckers stop 'fore your ass get shot
I'm the D-O-G and your ass is not
