Step to me if you're ready for a beatdown
Swift wit my hands, I don't fuck around
I'm laying out MC's in a sec
I'll get wreck and break your muthafucking neck
Who can step to me from Compton
None them rappers cause I'm still stomping
So bail in your best MC's
Nigga, please
I'll wax you, tax you, I'll just fax you
Put in ?(sominian)? pumps to cold mack you
You think your rhymes are so fine
I'm rolling through Compton wit a TEC-9
Eazy, you're sloppy, Dre you know you're played
Ren, You're cool but your rhymes don't lay
Against the D-O-G
The only dope rapper you had was I-C-E
But you tried to jerk him like a sucker
That's why he's larger than you dumb muthafuckas
And if there was a repercussion, there was no discussion
So the shit ain't nutting
And if you think you can fuck wit the D-O-G
Ha-ha, step to me

Step to me...

Watch me slip (niggas chant)
You better have fear
Somebody should've told ya the Dog is near
I'm wiping that ass like tissue
Best believe the Dog's gonna dis you
Rip you up, tip you up, cold bust your lips up
Now shut the fuck up
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
You know you can't fuck around wit the Jim Brown
Running MC's like a quarterback
Brothers are wack, I want my muthafucking money back
All those tracks you made
Fuck your grade cause your shit is played
Dis me, why bother
Stepping to me, you rather step to your father
Yea, and I'm all that
And NWA is crazy wack
Peace to Ice Cube, peace to Ice-T
DJ Quik, you can suck my dick
Then want to wax that ass
And send you back to hardcore class
And if you think you can fuck wit the D-O-G
Bring it on, step to me

Step to me...

Step to a man wit the clan at hand
Ina masterplan, shit, Godam
Lethal weapon, rhymes are def and
Tim Dog's a man, you shouldn't a been sleeping on
I carry on wit the song, you're right, I'm dog-gone
Word is born
I'll compare and dare wit a stare
Your sayind where, I'm over here
Rap bull, a guerilla warfare
Dis my crew, don't you dare
Girls jock me, crowds clock me
While rap artists peer's cock block me
But if there a rapper that think that he's better than me
Bring it on, step to me

Step to me...
