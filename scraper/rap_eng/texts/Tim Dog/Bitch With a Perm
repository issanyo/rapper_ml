With so many Gs in the industry
I'm being sweated by this smut and his name is Snoopy
But huh, somehow, someway
He keep biting Smooth B and Slick Rick style every single day
May...I...dis you for a while ?
Hey...punk...you know that's really not your style
I'm trying to figure something out
Why you live with your mama while my pad is free
You can come to my crib and lick my (ping)
Ride on my wood 'till I bust a (ping)
Huh, so whatcha gonna do ?
Black, you ain't got what Dr.Dre boy you can't do jack
So close the door and turn off the light
Coz you'll be pumping my hits all night
So don't you ever try to dis
Tim Dog's on the set, so sucker, bounce to this !

[Hook:]
[Bitch with a perm, bitch with a perm
I don't give a (scratch) about a bitch with a perm]
(4x)

I'm sitting in my crib watching MTV
When this skinny punk rapper on the telly try to dis me
He tried to flex on the D-O-G
But if I gave the punk binoculars he still couldn't see me
So shake your bones and your rattle
And leave your toy 9 at home and bring your skills to the battle
Like Jeru, I'm gonna damage
I'm starving for success and you'll get eaten like a Burgerking sandwich
It's a pity fake suckers gotta show off
I'll bust your skinny head with a sawed off
I heard your mother was a dope fan [Hit me]
I heard your father was a dick fan [Sssht]
And when your (ping) was locked up in the county jail
I heard you pressed up Lee Jeans [Sssht]
So step back from the lyrical maniac, I'm ripping your track
And as a fact, I can never be whack
And if you think you're hard, push your luck around
Dog is the man who can buck you down !

[Hook] Yeah, it's like that

I'm the original hardcore lyric ballbreaker
When it comes to whack MCs no I'm not a funk faker
I smash, I crash, and put you in the trash
And give you new rhymes like you never learned in class
I'm a real MC and I'm on my own
And if nobody got my back, I can hold my own
If I die, I die, if I live then I live
But if Hip-Hop survive, I got something I can give
I don't care if you don't think I can win
And I don't care if you don't wanna be my friend
And if the Pound get mad and they want some beef
Yo, I don't want it cause y'all vegeterians

[Hook] It's like that, yeah

Yeah, kid, this business ain't big enough for two dogs
So let the battle begin
Haha, but you don't want it
Coz I'll end ya carreer
You bit ya style from Slick Rick
You sound like Smooth B
And ya try to bite the name from the D-O-G
But I'm the real, haha
The real, so let the battle begin
