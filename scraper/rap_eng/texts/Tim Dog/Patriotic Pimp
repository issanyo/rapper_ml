I'm a rebel, a stone not a pebble
But some say that's a sign of a devil
They don't want hard rap on the radio
They say they won't play me no, but then it's a maybe-so
They want records that's not too black
Well if it ain't black then the shit is wack
I'm as commercial as commercial can get
I'm Tim Dog and I'm full in effect
I get diamonds, furs, ride in Benzes
I hate the girls who wear contact lenses
Or extensions, but not too mention
You see a lot at the rap conventions
I'm an ego-trip, yeah I'm conceited
What you got I sure as hell don't need it
I have everything my heart desire
And if I didn't then I'd be a liar
I'm a thousand-word picture
Try to step to me, watch whatcha get ya
Full of [?] and real [?]
I step off with all the bitches

I'm large...yeah
I'm large...yeah
I'm large...yeah

I'm Dog, for those that know me
And if you should and you don't, you won't
I crash and bash and smash and trash, step in my path
Homeboy, I'ma eat your ass
I'm a pit, some call me Cujo
Give me respect I suggest you do so
I proclaim the game to fame and aim, remain the same
Yo what the fuck is my name?
Tim Dog and don't forget it
All you bitches I know that you're with it
I'm a grow and show the broken flow
Come squeeze a hoe and make some dumbass dough
I'm gettin' large by minute and sec
And come correct in full-effect
Some ask the question why did you make it
Because I knew the radio wouldn't play this
I made a record that I can implore to, avoid to
And the girls can enjoy too
I'm Dog, rap Lord Prime Minister sinister
I let you know the fuck, when it's the time
To rhyme mine, define, hide behind the line
But in due time, hear the rhyme
Hypo-nitro, might go, past go
Words continue to flow at a ratio
Of speed, like Apollo Creed
You get jabbed with a metaphor rap
Compare me, dare me, stare me, wear and tear me
Tryin' to scare me but you can't even scan me
Who the hell is better than me?
Well is it Dog or G-O-D?
I'm a go-getter, ride a Jeep not a Jetta
But if your girl wanna hang then let her
I'll bone that hoe I swear
And send her home with some dog hairs
I'm quite ill, but quite blunt
Suckers a pull a stunt, you know ya front
When you see my nine comin' out the leather strap
Boy you better step back

I'm large...yeah baby
I'm large...uh
I'm large...you don't wanna fuck with me baby
I'm large...yeah this is just something for the systems

All the motherfuckin' mack-daddies out there that got all the bitches on your dick
Makin' crazy cash and you know you got it going on
So whenever [?] some ol' stank dirty hoe bitch tryin' to play you out
Just call up those famous words from Tim Dog
I'm large...
