[Intro:Ex-Girlfriend]
Colorless Love

(stacy-X)
YEEEEEAAAHHHH!!!!
Come On!!!
My Love Is Colorless, And Don't Just The Flava
Get Up, Hit Up
Get Off The Elbow, Hey Ya!, Save Ya
A Many Up Of The Mark And Turn Up And Bring Up
And Come With The Hog, Dog Punish Thru The Crime!
Give The Just That We All For This COLORBLIND!!!! (echo)

[Verse 1: Tisha-X]
I Got The Figure In My Mind
There's A World Your Rising
When Need Your Love And Needs The One
(LISTEN UP!) This Once That You're Rules
Act Like You Know Just Start Making Moves
(And You Need To Stand Together!!! Yeah
Just Things The World To Be!
Black & White Together Make It Last Forever)
So When You Things That We Make It Thought!!!

(Chours)
Colorless Love
That's What We All Be
Colorless Love
That's We're One Big Family
Colorless Love
That's What I'm Looking For
Colorless Love
Just Give It To Me,Just Give It To Me

[Verse 2: Julia-X, Monica-X, Stacy-X]
I Hope You Not Prejudice
Don't You Treat Me That A List
They Cause Of My Skin Color,There's Cause Of My Skin Color
Lift Your Head Up Till The Light (Everything's Gonna Be Alright)
We Have Make It A Better Place

[Bridge:Tisha-X]
Hope It For Back Of The Mind, I'll Sure Can't Find It
(What Is A Help Of True Confidential?)
Can't Read About It
We Are Rush To Me In The Personality

(Chours 2X)

[Ex-Girlfriend: Bridge]
EX-GIRLFRIEND IS BACK!, YO!!, EX-GIRLFRIEND IS BACK! [4X]

[Rap: Tim Dog]
It's Tim Dog!
He's Chilling With Ex-Girlfriend
Call The X Not Crew It Connects
And If You Lovin' That Skin This Way
Cause Ain't No Play But The Dog As Any Way
The MC's So Close, Trying To Playin' Cool
The Day That Just Like A Wall!
I got the hardcore rap score, elevated folklore
Nonsense I ignore, Tim Dog is called y'all

[Outro: Stacy-X]
Love Knows No Color!, Peace, We Outta Here!

(Chours 2X)
