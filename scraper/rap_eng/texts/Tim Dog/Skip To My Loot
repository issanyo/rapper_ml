Oh shit;

Huh, and ever be no other above me;
Rollin' with the dog, on some ol' bronx shit
Money, bitches, jewels noir quit

I strive to keep bang, yo
And if i ain't got my nine, i got my shank;
Stay out the trouble, if it's black on black,'couse thats wack
So brother ease back;
But also i know, the worse devil is a black
Devil on a 'nother level, labeled as a nigga;
Tryin to live bigger, don't make me pull the trigger;
Huh, i'm from the ghetto, i'm not for settle;
And even with a haume or a vest, you get wet-oh

Punks with no skills gettin' jacked;

And suckers are ments that imma black man

Smooth b., tim dog the bronx troopers
We live life on the peacefull
But if a sucker violace, believe crews to see full
Piece by piece, you, one high these, too
Raps from bronx continly stomp any crew
Lyricly i'm live, cause 'em swift
Pass the jelause on the spliff, cause i supply the rap gift
