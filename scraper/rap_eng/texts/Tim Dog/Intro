[Intro & verse 1:Tim Dog]
Coming straight out of N.y
BX warrior it is I
Tim Diggity, Tim Dog
First dog in the game
First dog with the name
You don't believe me go to 88 ain't shit change
Chilling all the way in Oslo
Yeah, for all those motherfuckers that don't know where Oslo is
It's in Norway baby, ha ha
North of Europe, the hot zone
Catching rec right now with my man Tommy Tee
For those who don't know, on the street we call him Tee Murda
'Cause he murdering the music baby
This is murder music baby, murder music nigga
Yeah, we kill al the noise
Yeah that's right


Snoop to took the name
X took the bark
That nigga took my shit gon' lay in the park
That's my word
So go tell your man what you heard
Tell Dog is back and he's rhyming absurd
Fuck one of the fifty niggas that talk too much
Rapping by a hundred shelves that don't cost too much
Hit all ya'll niggas
Spit one for all ya'll niggas
Fuck with Tim Dog
You gonna fall young nigga


[Loudmouf Choir]
Ya heard
You all nerds, pop over couple rap
Yo anybody heard

[Tim Dog]
I'm a 15 million debt that means I don't sweat

[Loudmouf Choir]
You gotta pay your debt
Or we come to collect
Show me respect
Or show you my tech
Pull out my rubber grip Glock
Put foam in your neck
