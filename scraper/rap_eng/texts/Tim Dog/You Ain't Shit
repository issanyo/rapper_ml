[Intro]
Yeah, ha ha ha
This goes out to the motherfuckin' MCs in the business
You know who you are
My motherfuckin' name is Tim Dog and I ain't takin' no shorts
And I'm getting ready to wax that ass like this

[Verse 1]
(Dog growling)
Give me the microphone, let me recite the poem
Rappers today ain't shit
Puttin' out records without one hit, huh!
Their career depends on a gimmick
Your lyrics so sick you should take 'em to the clinic
What I'm talkin' about is a sell-out
Your wack boy, now get the hell out
Rappers like Kid 'n Play, rappers like Kwam√©
Rappers like Young MC with nothin' to say
Bullshit! Bullshit, Bullshit!
Ain't no way you're gonna tell me that's a hit
'Cause I'm not going out like a sucker
So you can call me a dumb motherfucker
I'm a [?] hardcore brother from the streets
With the dope-ass beats
Tim Dog and I'm true to my trade
And my trade will get me paid
And if you think crossin' over makes you legit
You ain't shit!

Y'know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah a lot of these motherfuckers out there got the wack lyrics
They got the wack beats
They gettin' promoted crazy
And then goin' platinum?
Get the fuck outta here, I ain't havin' it!

[Verse 2]
Yo, everyone wanna be down with a motherfuckin' hip-hop tribe
Talkin' that black shit, that wack shit
That peace shit, exact shit
Talkin' that red black and green
That's cool, but give me the green
You can be home preaching to your brotherman
I'll be home, fuckin' his girlfriend
I'm the lyrical, miracle, diabolical king
Look at the 3-D ring!
Power! Uh, comin' at your dome
Sending wack rappers home
You wanna go and go and just flow and flow
But your rhymes are too wack for your show
You wanna fuck with the D-O-G
But you could never, ever, ever fuck with me
And if you think crossin' over makes you legit
Baby you ain't shit!

Whooo!
Yo, you know what we go to do
We got to bond together, all the hardcore rappers
And smoke this weakness
'Cause this is a motherfucking disease that's goin' take money out my pocket
And I ain't tryin' to have that shit

[Verse 3]
One-two-three-four-five-six-seven MCs
Get waxed with ease
I'm the motherfucking man ya heard about
Tim Dog, huh, I got the clout
I got the energetical, theoretical, copacetical, alphabetical, hypothetical
Lyrics to wax attack new jacks
And put the [?] in wax
Yeah, suckers get on my nerve
That's why I gotta serve
Take a nigga like MC Hammer
A wack-ass rapper but a dope-ass dancer
But still he win rap awards
Public Enemy it's time to get yours
You gotta be a villain
'Cause Tim Dog, I'm microphone killin'
I'ma step to a wack MC
And if he tries to get beef with me
I'ma wax his ass, I'ma tax his ass
I'ma fax his ass and cold lax his ass
I'm lettin' you know I'm from the Boogie Down
I'm not fuckin' around
So if you think crossin' over makes you legit
Nigga you ain't shit!

[Outro]
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
So don't forget about me baby
And I'm lettin' you know
I'm steppin' to anything that's wack
'Cause it's because of the wack that the good can't rule
Y'know what I'm saying
So we got to do what we got to do
To get what we got to get
Like my man Chuck D said "How low can you go?"
Straight up and down
Peace to the Zulu Nation
And I'm outta here

Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!
