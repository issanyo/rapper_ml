Yeah
Uh
Jets nigga where haven't we been
Jets nigga where haven't we been
Jets nigga where haven't we been
Spitta
But I'm kind of a big deal
And my crib smells of rich mahogany
I have a lot of leather bound books
Uh
YeahUh

Let up the gull wing doors
300SL mother fucker google those
If you're not sure think back
Kanye West, Diamonds Are Forever video
Yeezy sent on speeding through a jewelry store window
I burn joints to the end with my kinfolk
Nigga what's the point of you breathing if you not getting dough
Bitches know Spitta's so cool
That's why they always wanna fall through
Smoke and watch cartoons
Niggas hating on the dude
They wanna attack him
But you can't tackle him
Tecmo Bowl, Bo Jackson
Shoes of the same name, black and grey
Usual suspects, Spitta closet so safe
Fake limp through the door, wait
Of the home where your bitch say that you gone for the day
Now the bitch want to play
I bang and bounce
I don't lay up with that ho, no
Escargot, my car go 160 quickly
I wreck it, buy a new one
Last week I had a red Porsche, now I'm in a blue one
I didn't trade it, I got two of them
Yeah
