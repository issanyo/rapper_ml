[Intro: DJ Don Cannon]
Imma try something different on this one
Imma let this CD ride out
And I ain't gonna say too much
Don Cannon, (?) Smokee Robinson
Aw yeah
And I'm out, watch this

[Verse Curren$y]
Nigga I'm
Making moves word to Asher
Spliff crews recording my album and mastered
Flew to the moon 'cause they said it was made of cheese
Be it the strain or the vein, its all good for me
In the mix of the murderers
Strip club parking lot, chalked out
Cause drunk niggas refuse to talk it out
Stomping out lit weed clips, finger stingers
On the (?) actresses and related sisters
Its the king of this rhythmic linguistic killer shit
Rolling that weed, parental advisory sticker shit
Nigga fuck censorship
That crowd moved but I just couldn't get into it
I'm too big homeboy, simply couldn't fit
I concentrated on myself and I struck it rich
Was offered multiple incentives but I couldn't switch
But I did get switches on that S10 Blazer
Like Mr. Oscar, my pops parter slash next-door neighbor
Might run for mayor, feeling so player
Word to (?)
At the Source magazine photoshoot with my homeboy Wiz
On some live nigga shit, G'ed up
Chopped it up, ain't copped no cyphers, just chilled
Yeah

Ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Ain't nothing going on but the
Hitting all night long
Fool ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Nigga ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
Hitting all night long
Fool ain't nothing going on but the bomb ass rap song
