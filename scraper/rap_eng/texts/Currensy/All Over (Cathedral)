[Intro]
Everybody listen out, Damaris know
Yea, I like that, yea (x9)

[Verse 1]
This that 1989, Uzi on the passenger seat
Corvette drop top, Ocean Drive
Hoes out looking at me, danger
Audio dope slanger, all angles
Try to hang with that
Cut you down when they find you swaying
I don't know new shit, I'm just saying
Shits serious man, high stakes
High prices, high bitches in condos
Suicidal, jumping off the balconies of they high rises
Trying to see who the fliest and dyeing
Any crime is a crime, but crime pays
99 ways, how many more?
Dollars can we make before this bitch blow

[HOOK]
Till it's all over
Got money all over, over
Got jewelry all over, over
Until it's all over, over
Got bitches all over, yea
Got bottles all over, yea
Sports cars all over, yea
Until it's all over

[Verse 2]
This that 1972, riding O'Neil in a Cadillac coupe
Trying to get out the game, figured 30 bricks of cane
Be enough to make it rain, work for the whole crew
Last move then be through
Sell a dime with the main bitch
Maybe skeet skeet a lil junior
Show him how to do it
Lay down rules, carry on tradition
Maintain the cool, first we got to get out the shit though
Let all of the shit go, get rid of them chick files
Relocate zip codes, go in complete flip mode
Bitch know, your old friends, got to forget those
Life we choose, the shit cold
Ice on my wrist, blood in my veins froze
Audio bricks of white gold
Get your soul, sold

[HOOK]
Till it's all over, yea
Got money all over, over
Got jewelry all over, over
Until it's all over, over
Bitches all over, yea
Got drugs all over, yea
Sports cars all over, yea
Until it's all over, yea

[Outro]
Till it's over, over, all over
Until it's all over, yea
Got jewelry all over, yea
Got money all over,yea
Got bitches all over, yea
Until it's all over, yea, yea, haha
Your bitches come over, haha
Yea, yea, till it's all over (yea, yea)
Got jewelry all over [yea (x6)]
