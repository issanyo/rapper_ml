[Intro: Curren$y]
Still trying to teach Crossy the difference between
Wine and fine champagne
Its alright
His Rolex game is correct
Regal Al just pulled up
Uh

[Verse: Curren$y]
Elevator doors, her Le Pearle hit the floor
Vintage bad bitch that I seen a couple times before
In a Miami night club
We had a brief talk, we was vibing
I got distracted wyling with my dogs
When I looked back she was gone
Disappeared in the fog
Thought I'd never see her again
But here we are
Dressed elegant like she was presenting an award
Booty clapping through it all
Round of applause
I'm like mama do you smoke
She said but of course
So we sparked
I spit darts
Game in her brains
For us to see each other again was meant
To ignore the signs being sent wouldn't make sense
We could change the world over mama change how it spin
I'm your coach baby girl
I'm not trying to be your pimp
I got homies need a chick to drive this Benz 'cross town
With a box in the backseat and not look in
She ate that mission up like it was some M & Ms
Like candy from a baby
She swerved that Mercedes from point A to point Z
She text me when she made it
I said baby you the greatest
Now get back here safely
I'll have a joint rolled up waiting
The life we dating
But these is just jux to big paper
We crooks in the castle
Planning another caper
We not Bonnie and Clyde
No matter how high I get
I never let her drive
She might try to hit the switches on my '65
(Chuckles)

[Sample]
For every blow depends on breath control
So its the first thing you must learn
Fortunately its easy
You'll soon learn

[Outro: Curren$y]
Fo'20 Massacre
Yeah
