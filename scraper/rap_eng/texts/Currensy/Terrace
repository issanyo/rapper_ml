[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I seen't it all from my terrace (repeat)
Seen't it all from the terrace (repeat)
I took yo girl to my terrace
She took me round the world on my terrace
She was abducted by a terrorist, yeah that's if we let you tell it
She on some JetLife embitterment, she know that's gas she can smell her fist
She naked french inhaling shit, I'm 50 floors up nailing it
You tryna search through her emails and shit, soon as she text me she erase that shit
She like them cars we be racing in, that paper we be racking in, like leaves
She be like "don't leave please", I be like "bitch please, how else i'm gone make it?" Shit

[Hook:]
Seen't it all from the terrace (repeat)
Seen it all from the terrace (repeat)
Seen it all from the terrace
My brother ordered your murder from my terrace
I signed a major label merger on my terrace

I seen't it all from the terrace
Seen't it all from the terrace
Seen't it all from my terrace
In the suit with the wrap around terrace sweet view, but ain't nothing sweet fool let me tell ya

[Verse 2:Curren$y]
Now you can wait around forever, for a muhfucka to help ya
Or pursue your own endeavors, 'til you sittin' in a room full cheddar
Count that money stop BS'ing, lose your chance second guessing
Or half stepping i'm takin lessons in money stretching from the best ones, game preaching straight blessings
Wait until I pull my next one, make the Lufthansa Heist look like amateur night tryna bet some
Laid it down make it real, prize behind closed doors let's make a deal choose one
My style give that bitch chills, goosebumps
