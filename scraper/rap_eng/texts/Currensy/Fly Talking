Homie you don't want no trouble with a thug
Put a hole in your Cutlass
Yo we catching a bus to the club
I'm a G, that's all that's in my blood
And that's why these niggas can't do it how I does
Slim got killed (?) did too
Lost my other homie and they locked Big U
So
I guess I gots to hold them down
I'm from the East but i get that love uptown
Because they showed me how to move like a crook move
Never started rapping 'til I made it out of high school
Yah I remember how those tough guys do
(?) while you're creeping through the drive-thru (sup Tweet)
Do it just like the Menace
And my dick seen more mouths than a dentist
A young nigga running with them old killers
Mind yours and stay outta grown folk's business
Spitta, nigga
Shit the boy paid extra for the clips
'Cause I gotta stay strapped for these lames
I put a hole in his middle like a Krispy Kreme glaze
I had a CLK for three days
I won that from Corey 'cause I beat him in a race
My girl keep telling me these niggas gon' hate
But mama I ain't gotta hide from them niggas
And that's why I'm in the Bentley with no tint on the windows
I bought it I want you to see me in it

Tell them pussy niggas don't bother me
