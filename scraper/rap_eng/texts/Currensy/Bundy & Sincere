[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, Eastside
Uh

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Bullshit run a marathon
Rap shit got my parkin' Bentleys on a lawn
Continental Ts, got that red label on ours
Don't confuse me with these other rap frauds
I'm a crocodile in the swamp, them niggas is little frogs
Back to back, G bodies, Chevies with my dogs
Freddie safe full of fetti, plottin' another heist
Already, I'm ready, already outside
Three in the morn', like Bundy told Sincere
My nigga come on, I'm 'bout to start blowin' the muhfuckin' horn
I'm tryna get everything I want painted and rimmed up
Before the fall really hit
This jet life shit, ESGN, sippin' juice and gin
Got my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Money and yo' bitch, both on my line
Told shawty that I can't make it
Told money I'll be on the way, quick
Sands in the hour glass, so goes the days of our lives
Make sure you touch something luxurious before you die
Light one for Mac Miller, Blue Slide Park in the sky, still in here

[Interlude: Freddie Gibbs]
Yeah
Rest in peace, Mac

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, wet dope on the Bounty paper, I lay it down
Let it dry, you can leave the money and stick around
Feel like I'm stuck in the system, runaway slave child
My lifestyle straight out the gang files
Can't drank, insane, bunny rabbit five game
Rest in peace Big Lord, he took a thigh shot in the main vein
Bitch, I rap for fun and sell that coca leaf to maintain
Niggas gettin' a check off of that Meth, I made a lane change
Walter White, walk the wheat
Cookin' up that Jesse Pink
Niggas'll open up they mouth to talk some shit
But they don't often eat
Me and my comrades is well fed
Sincerely yours, unfadeable Fred
Kane

[Outro]
What else can I say? I say
You kept it real, today
