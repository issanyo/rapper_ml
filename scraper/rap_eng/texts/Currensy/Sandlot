[Verse 1: T.Y.]
My neck and wrist both smothered in gold
And it feel like I gained a few pounds 'cause this shit weigh a load
See that Wraith like driving a boat
Put that mother fucker on the interstate, and watch how it float
My nigga Spitta yea he taught me the most
Out in ATL Mean Streets Studios cooking up dope
I play the sweats with the Louis V coat
And like a mob boss unto our accomplishments we toast
I'm hella fed up with fools who breakin' the code
Had to go and bless my neck with a lil' rose gold
And homie mad 'cause his bitch watch all my videos
Tuned in like ya boy her favorite episode
I don't hustle for these hoes, never did never will
Was motivated when I seen Boosie crib
Knowing that I could get it, so that's what I did
Hitting bitches out the park on some homerun shit

[Chorus:T.Y.](x4)
Yea nigga this the sandlot
Knocking bitches out the park back to they mans spot

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Don C slash Mitchell & Ness collab shorts at my gym class ball out
All net or I might kiss it off the glass
Wrong sport my bad, we on a baseball diamond
This is high priced rhyming
I spell my gang name with diamonds
Slid up with my young homie behind me in his own Maserati
No bitch I didn't buy it
He put his hustle down, he went out there and got it
He was the lil dawg now he like my grown patna
I'm proud of my young playa, I sit back and watch him
I told him that these hoes they for everybody
They not your property
Did she fuck your homie? yea probably
But that's not important, focus on building your monopoly
Them bitches gon' be where them dollars be, follow me
And I could show you some of that killa that my homegirl been growing
Act like you been knowing
Yea

[Chorus:T.Y.](x4)
Yea nigga this the sandlot
Knocking bitches out the park back to they mans spot
