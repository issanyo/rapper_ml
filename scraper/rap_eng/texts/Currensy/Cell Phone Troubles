I just lost my cell phone charger
But a nigga still got bars
And a mean ass hook like a pirate arm
Read a book on how to build a bomb
Now you can wake up in the morning smelling napalm
Niggas thought it was over but they wrong
He from New Orleans they kill niggas where he from
Your best bet is to give him whatever he want
Your girlfriend asking where I got the weed from
Now my niggas asking me where I got the freak from
Pause
'Cus she so 'bout it the bitch even gave head to my accountant
Pause
Rich niggas get bread and cheese and
I'm trying to make me a big ass Grilled cheese sandwich 'fore I leave
Off this wicked planet of war with me
Watch out for jabs and bob and weave
They coming for my hair brother
A pussy nigga will kill you because he scared of you
A bitch nigga can't will trip you to get ahead of you
Your man will crack under pressure and lead the feds to you
Your bitch will crack under pressure and get your man on you
Internet hackers now they running scams on you
Brutal ass police putting they hands on you
If you don't got drugs on you they'll plant it on you
I pray to God you never hear them bars slamming on you
'Cus I'm pretty sure the man got a plan for you
My cell phone says no service but I still got bars
