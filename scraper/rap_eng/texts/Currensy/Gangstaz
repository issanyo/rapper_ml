[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Four wheelers at the compound, watching the sun go down
High top, my money mount
Pitch like Craigh through that brick crack
Deebo in this shit like

I fucked on her, tho I didn't really want that bitch
See her due to haters, so I had to take her
I can’t allow mistakes to be making with my paper
Because the game major, shuffle like a disc changer
Bangers, smokers, drinkers at the plane hangar
I maintain my vices, yeah tho I flirt with danger
I’m all about my money, I'm not no skirt chaser
Them hoes is still be around later, waiting on the real player

[Verse 2: Tiny C Style]
Paddle to the medal, moving like I'm sposed to
Getting rich off the streets and pro tools
Riding new but damn I love them oldschools
Streets fucked up, damn I miss them old rules
False flagging, niggas fronting like they g’d up
That’s why they double salute, when they see us
Keep it gangster  ‘til I go
Silent like a marble floor
Want me in your city, then book me for a show
Living lavish and flashy like a gangster supposed
Draped in diamonds and gold, wearing the finest of clothes
Long Beach, City of God
Bossin’ up like the mob
At the crab tables in Vegas, I'm with the gang going hard
Gangster life ‘til its over, Bentleys, Benzes and Rovers
You now tuned into the coldest
Come baby fuck with the owner
19,000 or nothing, you disagree then we coming
Gangsters bitch, we make the world go round, don't you forget it dummy
