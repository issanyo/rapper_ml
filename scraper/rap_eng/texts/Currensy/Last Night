[Chorus]
Last night, niggas took all the bitches
Last night, we pulled up and left with all the hoes
This morning I woke up and counted up a million
This morning I woke up and I sent your bitch home
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture

[Verse]
Still got my first Bentley
Been on since the beginning
Every piece that I been gettin' only make me want more
Thousand dollar plate dinners, real businessmen
Banquets and benefits
Million dollar signatures and shitty penmanship
Oh I was meant for this, I was designed to get it
Came off of the porch sick with it, older homie's made me iller
Can't get much realer, [?] serial killer
From far away you feel it
Don't let that paper steal you, my nigga

[Bridge]
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
Who let 'em in here?
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
Who had 'em sent here?
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
They hired killa's
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
[?]

[Chorus]
Last night we was some more old baller shit
Last night we came down and took all the hoes
This morning I woke up and count another million
This morning I woke up and sent your bitch back home
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
Paper and pistols
Drugs and bitches
Snakes and real niggas
All in the picture
Who let 'em in here?
