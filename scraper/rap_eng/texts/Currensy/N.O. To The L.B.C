Yup
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I'm a mad ass lunatic
Nigga with a vicious spit
Real live New Orleans nigga
I be getting a grip
On the grind all the time
Ask my homies from the 504, you know
Yeah, I keep it G
Did a mixtape while in the LBC
California weed had me rapping in my sleep
Blowing dottie and pimp smacking the beat
I'm laid bak like my airplane seat
And while I count money, you count sheep
I'm old school, I'm so cool
You only pop big shit on pro tools
Don't speak to me when I roll through
Cause I'll act like I don't know you
Spitta keep it authentic every minute that a nigga living
I gotta get more loot, yeah

[Verse 2: (J-Deeds)]
I'm an east side Long Beach (?) of the FS Jet set
Bout to set off to the next check
(?) blowing trees
Ask the homies on the east
(?) they know
That a young nigga all about the pesos
Big phantom and I whip it like yayo
Like Snoop told you, niggas better lay low
If not I'll turn your fitted hat to a halo
They know if its not kush we don't blaze it up
Its Rayo in this bitch, we never change it up
Fucking with my nigga Spitta got it raining bucks
And if your bitch got her wish she wish she came with us
