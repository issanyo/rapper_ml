Uh
Yup
Yeah
Yeah
Jets
Nigga
Uh

And you heard that them jets came through in them Corvettes
Had the (?) up tempos
White yellow suede with the yellow checks
Started out collecting basketball cards, upper deck
Now I drive basketball cars, Spurs, word
Bout to be a rap on y'all herbs
Put an alkaseltzer tablet in the bread before I feed you to birds
Bitches think Spitta gon' spend the loot
They hopping 'round like cats on a hot tin roof
Hopped in coupes, hopped out, hopped in leers
Made the decisions that separated me from my peers
At first niggas thought I was tripping
Now they pipe-lining, trying to regain their position
Not a chance
Big dog need a big yard, lot of land
Big crib, me and Sosa had the same floor plans
Nigga couldn't catch up with both hands
Spitta nigga

Yeah
F
I
N
