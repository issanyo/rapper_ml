Weed my shorty roll em while I'm still...
Yea jets
Fool
And Don Cannon run your nigga right back
Bitches just fell thru with the loud pack
No cigars in my session, my crew don't allow that
Yea

Wake up in the morning wash my face and then I brush my teeth
Ain't gotta roll no weed, my shorty roll em while I'm still asleep
I'm caught up in that thang, mary jane got a hold of me
Environmentalist I'd handcuff myself to a purple tree
Snooty Trudy lyin' to me sayin' she ain't heard of me
Groupie who you foolin' you know you be youtube searchin' me
I'm startin' to believe these freaks is passin by us purposely
Hoping that we offer em sofa seats and we pour em drinks
Is you trippin' ain't no nigga sippin' nowhere close to me
Keep it pimpin' Jets up over bitches, how its suppose to be
Fire red five's with the ice sole, cold feet
Shout out to Bangladesh what it do we tryin' cop a beat

You know where we at if you need um
Somewhere in the scraper with the beats up
Something pretty with me rollin' weed up
She dog you cause you treat her like you need her
Make sure you see my shoes I kick my feet up
I made it cause I always stay g'd up
If I said it then you know you could believe me bruh
We keep it way to smokey in here to see us

Bitches flirtin' sex appeal cause we got that corvette appeal
Did it independent for the record, fuck a record deal
Did it for my niggas on the sets still at it
I asked um what's good in the hood and they sayin' shit happen
Wild niggas still clappin', cheese eatahs still rattin'
I seen it all before like a rerun of family matters
I'm laughin' at my partner, lost 5000 in that madden
My younger homie beat him, he 13 yrs old stackin'
I'm watchin' action jackson in the palace smokin' cabbage
Just relaxin' mixin' hashes till I feel like I know magic
I'm travelin' and seein' the mad jets, cashin' the mint checks
We got now you got next, and I know you mad stressed
How I made it through the stress: stamina, long wind
You think you fuckin' with the Jets, come on man
Better clean your lenses, fool you lookin' at the wrong man
Strong scented weed, old cars new bitches in the seats

Yea
Jets, fool
