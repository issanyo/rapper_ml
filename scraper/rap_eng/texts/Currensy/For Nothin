[Hook]
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
All my cars at least a 100
Barely get the chance to run 'em
Ros√© popping 'round the club
Baby girl, you know I ain't coming
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
All my cars at least a 100
Barely get the chance to run 'em

[Verse]
7 chains on, walking 'round my house I ain't going out
Washed my car left the park driver look like a car lot
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
7 chains on, walking 'round my house I ain't going out
Washed my car left the park driver look like the car lot
Smoked out in the coffee shop
Camaro with targo tops
You know that the motor hot
Hit that bitch with the LSY, can't handle the shit I got
Make sure that your camera was in my watch
The shit I drop is quickly copped
They figure I'm slinging rocks
What they based it on, the money I make from touring
Being away from home
Still I return to the danger zone
Skating on Dayton chrome to show 'em I made it, homes
Jet Life, we the kings of underground
Bump Pimp C when I came down
[?] fuck around, when we come around
On the couch with all my rings on
What you getting in tonight
Not a motherfucking thang, homes
Fuck what you lil hoes talking 'bout

[Hook]
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
All my cars at least a 100
Barely get the chance to run 'em
Might pass 'round the club but you know I'm not coming
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get fly as fuck for nothin'
I get high as fuck for nothin'
I'm high and fuck with nothin'
Crying [?]
I'm a OG I fuck for nothin'
You had to pay her to touch it
