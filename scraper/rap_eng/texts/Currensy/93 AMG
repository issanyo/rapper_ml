Pink champagne underneath the blue moon
The Range plum, the Benz is maroon
96 AMG, remembering the time
Niggas got killed for shit like this
The city I live in, many have died my friend
Tears fall for your dawgs, dry your eyes off
Make sure you can see through the fall
Evil lurks, love hurts, knife in your back
I tried to warn you first, but you second guess
Thats why you slept
Thats why you slept, and you second guessed
Thats why you slept, and you second guessed
Trampling flowers with foot steps
Came to devour all your assets, yup

You ain't never seen a heist in your life
Recognise what you getting, what you witness
