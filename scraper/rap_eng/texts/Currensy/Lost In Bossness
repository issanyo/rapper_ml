[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, circle of bosses, bear skin rug
My magic carpet, broads dissapear off
Tits thighs so soft, ain't nah nigga touch
Unless he accepting the charges, 'cept for ya mans
From New Orleans, them broads is smart enough to know
That he a pro, and for G he never falling
So fuck 'em for a good time, then fall the fuck off for he push you off
Because he on his grind, rollie never set for quality time

[Hook: Curren$y]
Grown-ass women, and little girl games
Thinking that rap is all the same
Think a fat ass gone buy her house
And it probably will from one of these lames
Sex for checks is the name of they game
But with the Jets, you don't go that route
They get lost in the bossness
And all turned aroud, they get lost in the bossness
If they can't swim the drown, they get lost in the bossness
What you bitches gon do now, they get lost in the bossness
Can't go back to fucking with them clowns, because you lost in the...

[Verse 2: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Blazing 50's, so back like out the T tops and vibe with me
Of course with me, some broads and a ounce of this new sticky
The whip cloudy, my clothes crispy
Ridien through the city getting high with my pretty bittie
My game to much for her really, I got her hook on she silly
I'm high, focused on millies, she high, focused and willing
To do anything I tell her, she does it because I'm winning
No simping, alive and high, up and living

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
A good girl gone bad, I seen it all before
What's worse is that I might be the blame for it though
Shut your mouth that ain't the normal knock at that door
Might be them folks, you betta learn quickly how we roll, case closed
Add more to my bank roll, she know how this game go
Its cold so we smoke it by the O, you try to keep up not even close
Girl my countin never fold, fuck you take me for
This one of the trillest shit I ever wrote, Jet Life, Jets Go

[Hook]
