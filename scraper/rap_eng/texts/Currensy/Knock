[Intro: Curren$y]
All our shit knock, all our shit knock
All our shit knock, all our shit knock
Every time that we drop, all our shit hot
All our shit knock, all our shit knock

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
All stand in the driveway, from my blue six-tre
Low rider problems them bitches break every day
If you really bout it you gotta pay to play
Cost to be the boss, ain't that what they say?
Diamonds, Voss water, gloss, candy paint
Sweet tooth, you get cavities from my Chevrolet
14 karat gold Rollie, skates on the Wraith, motherfucker I don't play
Never did any day, more cake on the way
Nigga paper plates or fine China
It don't matter it don't make me, no never mind bruh
We gon' turn the whole industry into a diner

[Chorus: Curren$y]
All our shit knock, all our shit knock (la-di-da, la-di-da)
All our shit knock (jet life, jet life), all our shit knock (jet life, jet life)

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
It ain't no motherfuckin' question, you see it, know it's P
All of our shit knock, all of our shit clean
Got the whole parkin' lot candy and on D's
Mine triple gold and only plays Underground Kings
Gettin' mainstream dough off these underground rhymes
Still bustin' O's down, got a couple on me now
20 for the wipe down, got me feeling like I'm Boosie
Gas tank on E but my pockets hella Blueski's
Brought not built, if I buy it I rebuild
Know it dropped this year and I copped this year
Got the '96 tucked, might pull out this year
Been broke, came up shit I outlived my fears
Like if it's there cheap, what's gon' take to get it here?
That bitch know I'ma cheat so she can miss me with them tears
I'm tryna come through foreign then pull up and disappear
Like first class alright, but ain't nothing like them Lear's

[Outro: Curren$y]
All our shit knock (la-di-da, la-di-da), all our shit knock (jet life, jet life)
All our shit knock (jet life)
All our shit knock (la-di-da, la-di-da), all our shit knock (jet life, jet life)
All our shit knock (jet life)
La-di-da, la-di-da, jet life, jet life
La-di-da, la-di-da, jet life, jet life
