Honey counting 100 stacks with her titties out
Im smoking till this 9 foot window plotting on locking these cities down
Im talking plural more than 1 town I got 1
I need 2 get 3 more now control the whole grid
Gotta make it real somehow
4 mill worth of automobiles in front my house bitches know a nigga
If I say its going down, you can wait right here
For it to fall from the clouds
You have no idea what I been through
Pay the cost to be this, boss nigga you see bitch
So make room nevermind I got walk in closets in my crib twice this size
With all kinds of deadstock jordans locked inside
Real music lasts forever this is how we never die

[Trademark Da Skydiver]
The hardest niggas spittin' we the trillest crew in it
Jets set mofucka we been at it for a minute
No L'S on the record a few double U's pending
Translation we winnin' nigga!
Dropping cash on whatever fast
I ain't tripping watch me make it back
Spit some bars on a track in return I get some racks
Stacks on stacks on stacks
Polo slacks on slacks on slacks
With the socks and the shirt to match cool cat with my bucket hat
Chill new orleans nigga getting figures bitches fuck with that
Im coolin out in harlem 9-11 where my hustlers at
Laying in the trap, rollin sour at the pack
Posted right in front of 50 with the loud I know you hear me
Hollaback some other time not right now im on my grind
I want whats mine, and that includes what I been do im overdue
To dollar signs, diamond in the rough but fuck it
Still I shine, draped in the finest threads Ralph Lauren designs

[Whizz]
You see me getting to the money partner
I'm getting closer nigga closer
I'm running up it
The level growing and it’s growing like a country crocket
We get that potent dropping
And the people steady copping
We keep it coming and it’s coming like it’s never stopping
I get the road the roller like construction in the open
I gotta plan a jet across the land and over oceans
I’m seeing money bags up in my vision like I’m loaded
That’s just how deep I’m in this shit that money taking over
I think I’m going loony give a fuck I’m staying focused
It’s hocus pocus bitch like I’ve been whipping in the kitchen
I’m on the mission for big banking like the television
It’s higher definition up in every bar I mention
Nigga first class you don't see me slipping on my shifting

[Young Roddy:]
I let my nigga smash, I don't save no bitch
But now I'm like, light up and blaze that, yeah
Momma say she want a nigga who stay on his shit
Uh, and if that ain't trill, then what you call that
Them hood hoes swear to God I'm hood rich
They tryin' to count my cash girl fall back
I'm killing them niggas tell em go dig a ditch
And it was all good when it was all bad
Uh, my uncle done 22 flat, by the time he made it home
His little nephew was grown
With intentions to blow the fuck up, and put him on
So I'm steady, writing that ill shit, trying to make my meal ticket
Promethazine keep me tilting 650
When the clock struck 7 I had 7 grams of sticky
Uh, so when I'm in my zone please don't tempt me
I'm close to the edge so don't push me... out
