[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah
Yeah
With all due respect
Before one bar gets laid

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh
I been aging this brew for a minute
I been training with my crew
They all killers
Motion sensors at my crib
My collection worth millions
Jewelry, vehicles, sports memorabilia
You ain't making dough like us
You don't feel us
The shit we talk about is way too unfamiliar
I got the elevator in the crib
PA system in the ceiling
The shit you only see in an office building
The money make the more sophisticated women act like children
She nervous to speak when she near him
But she feel him
Cause she know my mind on billions
Never played games, I just wrote them big plays
Locked in on paper like when missiles engage
Firing away, the target is a pay day
Pull away in a Wraith
Catching stunts in the rain
Cuban links in my chain
Some things will never change

[Interlude: Curren$y]
Yeah
Yeah
La da da da da da
With all due respect
Fo'20 Massacre
La da da da da da da

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Cuban links in the chains
Some things will never change
A shot of Gran Marnier in my champagne
To give it a little twang
I'm stumbling to the plane
First class but I remember from where I came
In the coach seat sitting in the middle over the wing
I never complain
I was happy just to be in the game
Was happy that Master P gave me a chain
Foot in the door
They tried to close it and my ex sprang
But I'm sprinting after the paper
Ignoring the pain
Fast after the digits, every dollar to gain
Nothing to lose
But if we do then we gon' make it back gain times two
The fuck is you 'sposed to do
My nigga these are the rules
What the fuck is you 'sposed to do
When everybody in your crib is depending on you
Waiting for you to come through
Get to the line and shoot

[Verse 3: T.Y.]
Get your mother fucking mind right
And man I hustle so hard
That's the reason why I'm living so large
And if a nigga sneak diss then we get rid of that boy
Shottas on call
So I won't even get involved
Stick to this rap shit but they keep testing me god
Making this noise, making this money, making these moves
Laid my game down and I paid my dues
Now everybody wanting to know what the fuck I'm on
I never leave the crib without it so don't test me Homes
Putting people in my corner who gon' back me up
When times get rough
Lift the meter get the job done
I gotta be one of the hottest niggas under the sun
And no matter what goes on
Imma remain humble
I stay dry in a rainstorm without taking cover
I be riding 'round in my hood 'til that stack bundles
Come back with some Chinx Drugs
How to get rich nigga
I live life
And never be like you bitch niggas
Nigga
