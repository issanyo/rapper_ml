[Verse 1: Curren$y]
From the stage to the bus to the studio
Spit drugs on beats
Niggas ain't fucking with a G
Untouchable, bitches won't fuck with you
If I'm coming through they rather have a chance at the man
Comfortable in my d boy stance
Riding with [?] tryna see style in the [?]
Long beach smoke 28 grams
Assisted the pass look off the plane took off
Niggas get laid down over what they stood for
Casualties of a fucking hood war
Shit raw tryna live above the law
Spit Xan bars Ima cop another car
Your boy been a man from the motherfucking start
These other niggas lack the fucking heart
These other niggas just bitches and
Some of these bitches just tiresdfucking broads
It's like I bought the whole motherfucking mall
On my bus for the Pilot Talk tour
Surge protector I got plugs for you
Drugs all I'm the motherfucking drug store

[Verse 2: Mr. Marcelo]
I came up on that street
Cash shit
Nowadays I'm on my cheek shit
I wake and bake and count bread for breakfast
Learn how to get more money by investing
But as a youngin' niggas couldn't tell me nothing
I was always on my wild wild west shit
City on my fitted, hood on my hoodie
Blowing on good like nigga what's goodie
OG been looking like money
[?] 500 just doing 120
Motherfuckers know real when they see it
You could get straight A but you still can't Be it
Yeah, burner on tuck
Looking at niggas like who want what
[?] boy I been on game 5 dollar ass niggas I will make change
And you could put the house on it
But I ain't going out like Tony
A1 day 1 in these streets
Niggas living in the mud so they got to wear cleats
Beep beep for the money boy
Ain't nothing soft about me I go hard
Big dog in the yard of these streets
Started as a indian but now I am a chief
OG
