[Chorus]
Dancing [?] in the light
I ask why
Dancing [?] in the light
I ask why
Dancing [?] in the light, yeah, yeah
I ask why
Candles lit in the castle the night before the battle, yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
Candles lit in the castle the night before the battle
Chasing bags, fightin' shadows that been grabbin' at us
Angles on the hood avoidin' potholes in the hood
The first one that rolled in a Wraith through my hood
Show the homies that they could if they want it
Watch that paper, watch for hurdles, don't look back for your opponent
Motherfuckers'll be creepin' on ya at the exact moment
Overtakin', you left your number one spot vacant

[Chorus]
Dancing [?] in the light, yeah, yeah, yeah
I ask why

[Verse 2]
Smokin' by the pound with my young G
Say he puttin' away cheese 'til his pop's free
My suspicious neighbors always watchin' me
Wonder how I acquired my house keys
Of course they assume the drugs but I got the cult following
I'm just that loved, diamond and gold rosary beads around the necks of cold killers
If you cross one of them niggas may God be with you, yeah

[Chorus]
Dancing [?] in the light, yeah, yeah
I ask why
Dancing [?] in the light
I ask why
Dancing [?] in the light
I ask why
