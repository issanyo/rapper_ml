[Chorus: Styles P & Fiend]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I'm on the Lean off that Romulan and Ear Wax
Mad high, gettin' stuck on Fairfax
Now let me hit you with the clear facts
Got a bunch of sons but I didn't go bareback
Ghost Bars, Dead verses, to get a nigga high is the meds purpose
To bring a nigga down is the feds purpose
Like my insides white, but let me get a red surface
White walls, Caddy flow
That boy so G that even ya mom and daddy know
Ghost be gettin' high on the patio
Hit you with the ratty though right where you tatted though
I'm buggin' out, nah, you buggin out
Them niggas on the Lean so they went and pulled the buggies out
Its a lot of blue shit and its real bloody out
And its real pretty but I bet you it get real ugly out, yeah

[Chorus: Styles P & Fiend]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Right when fools thought I was all music
Leaned on 'em, flexed green on 'em and pinky rings on 'em
Never seen garments, Iceberg knits got Bart Simpson on 'em
Luxury sedans under car covers, interior gravy, softer than butter
I got that from hard work, I got more comin'
My styles, My fly got your woman
My nigga Corner Boy P keep his cup muddy
I don't drink but I keep it in my fridge for 'em
Me? I'm Champagne pourin'
Pedal to the floor in somethin' foreign, vertical liftin' door
Woke up this mornin', and came up with a way
To settle the score on these ol' hoe ass niggas
Run up the store, roll up the smoke, stand on the throat on these ol' hoe ass niggas
I be so mad wit 'em, but I ain't stressin', I'm chillin'
Livin' off the land, leanin' like a kick stand, yeah

[Chorus: Styles P & Fiend]
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
Lean in the whip, Lean in the cup
Lean off a blunt, Lean on a Budda
I lean on these bitch niggas wit' a gun
I lean on my money 'cause I stacked it up
