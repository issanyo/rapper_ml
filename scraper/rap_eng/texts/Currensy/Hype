[Verse 1:  A.M. SNiPER]
Who’s on the phone with the PM?
It’s A.M., I walk that talk, spray em
Talk about bars, clubs
Talk about clubs, spades
Talk about spades, shade
Talk about shade, beach
Talk about beach, Kandi
I’m a Napa man like Dammi
You’re a one punchline, one year plan
I’m a ten year brand, bring through the whole fam
British gent in a British jet overdressed with a rock’n’roll influence
Make a mil with every button that I press, call it button up stress
Middle finger to the press (middle finger to the press)

Not about that hype, not about all that hype
Not about that hype, not about that
Not about that hype, not about all that hype
Not about that hype, not about that

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Late night in my number 3 mikes
OG on the back, they say Nike - Air
Straight player for life, should’ve been awarded five mics
Break down weed on award-show invites, rather sit inside and play excite bike
Audio crack sales at the construction site
Mafia life, what you know about the type
41 millimetre hella ice, nice price
Pepped on site, you can see it from a satellite
Scared of brains, can’t see me I’m too tight
Game-on that’s the brand new range huh
Yeah ma, your boy kinda in the main now
Pilot the plane, leading the gang, stacking my change, won’t change now
Still got a couple hummers from the playground
R.I.P to the ones the bullets laid down
Let the weed get blazed now
