[Intro: Styles P]
Monsta Beatz. nigga
Ay

[Verse 1: Styles P]
What you know about go getters and JET setters?
Gun holdin' niggas that'll see what the TEC gets us
Pizz-ound, bid-irds nigga, play the cid-urb
You can get rich or die like you deserve
Me? I'm in the sun flyin' nigga, trying to swiz-erve
Money off the work or the nouns or the viz-erbs
If you got fire kush nigga, light the hit-erb
Puff that, pass that
Bitch coming through with an egg in her asscrack
Numbers like NASDAQ
The house and the condo look abstract
Every time I hit a blunt, I get a flashback
I'm that nigga, that nigga am I
Tell your bitch suck a dick, me and Spitta is fly
Said I'd quit selling bricks, but no quitter am I
Yeah, I'm in there, nigga, or I'm out there, nigga
Shot shit, sold work, I got clout there nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Whole code mafioso
How we come through the door, mafioso flow
Fuckin' bitches counting dough, mafioso
How we roll sittin' low, mafioso flow
Jekell and Hyde
When checks on the line you better know
Jekell and Hyde
When checks on the line you better know
How we flow mafioso, come through the door mafioso flow

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Smokin' good with my bitches on the hood of my car
Plannin' to take it all
How many of them jars you got, dawg?
I need a dispensary on empty street
Niggas don’t know if they're fans or they're enemies
All I know for sure is your girl sure diggin' me
Roll whole code mafioso
Roll with my D-Block homies
In the drop Chevy box with the gold D's on it
Riding low, highed up, stuntin' on them hoes
Laughin', countin' dough
Jekell and Hyde, when checks on the line
Dawg, you better know
Them niggas say, "Get off of the set," then you better go
'For you can't leave no mo', at least on your own
Treacherous crescent I roam
Hi, honey, I’m home
On my balcony, with a tray of Beignets, and my bong

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Whole code mafioso
How we come through the door, mafioso flow
Fuckin' bitches counting dough, mafioso
How we roll sittin' low, mafioso flow
Jekell and Hyde
When checks on the line you better know
Jekell and Hyde
When checks on the line you better know
How we flow mafioso, come through the door mafioso flow
