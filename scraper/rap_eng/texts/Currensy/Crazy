[Verse 1]
Yup
I'm s'posed to wait for it to come around again?
Fuck it I'm gonna go now
Same shit different shoe stepping in it
Maintain my ground, still got a pivot
Still buy new rides and floss on these bitches
Nice guy but its known I roll with killers
(?) do nothing but rap
Play video games, fuck hoes, and eat fruit snacks
Any nigga thinking about putting an end to that
I'm sorry for you
My niggas gonna throw a surprise party for you
Bananas and pajama clips
Cartwheel you niggas, tumble set your whip
Haha
Just leave me alone
Let me rock my ice cream cones and bones
Let me hang with my skater friends and smoke out the bong
Let me chill with my Cali girl and watch Cheech & Chong
Club with my Miami girl all night long
Pose in front of the Superdome on the cover of Rolling Stone
By myself feeling like I'm in the zone
And the van's bigger than you niggas home

[Hook]
Lil shorty, nigga I'll stop your glory
Glass jaw you niggas like an empty 40 sporty
Whatchu niggas want to hate for
You can get cracked in the head with a skateboard, crazy
Them bitches say Spitta you crazy
But at the same time they want to have a niggas babies
Haha

[Verse 2]
Bang
I shot should separate the rose gold from the copper
Hot Spitta nigga I'm a motherfucking monster
Fucking with me you gonna need a designated driver
To drive you to the doctor
When I pop you with them llamas
Blacka
Niggas know that I am an old soul and a true G
But I still got them peanut butter Guccis
Lug sole with the gold buckle
I might buy them (?) on my Source cover
(?) brother, that nigga is so gutter
Don't stutter nigga speak on what you feel
But if I think you tripping we gon' pop up with that steel
Haha
You niggas know I'm not playing
Ride a yellow Grand National on 20 inch Daytons
My bottom bitch keep a strap on her for niggas that be hating
Talk that shit I bag it up
Bring it on I'm gonna be waiting for you
Homie I ain't got no patience for you
Tell the Times (?)

[Hook]
Lil shorty, nigga I'll stop your glory
Glass jaw you niggas like an empty 40 sporty
Whatchu niggas want to hate for
You can get cracked in the head with a skateboard, crazy
Them bitches say Spitta you crazy
But at the same time they want to have a niggas babies
Haha
