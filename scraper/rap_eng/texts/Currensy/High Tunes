[Verse 1: Curren$y]

Up getting high round 7 am
And my girl start bitching about my friends
Because last night, niggas was going the fuck in
I stumbled through the door cloud 9, cloud 10
Yeah that was round 4, say 3 hours ago
Now i’m smoking out the crib, picking out clothes
What i’m most comfortable in
My khaki cargos, monte carlo
When I think of somewhere to go
I scan barcodes trying to see what its hitting for
Slamming my car door too hard you can’t ride with me no more
I don’t need a chain or a whip to get with these hoes
Word to the homie Wacko, ain't fucking with me natural
Factual, studies show your bitches go, hannibal
Trying to eat a nigga alive, that’s what this rap shit do
Them police is after you, niggas getting mad at you
Jet life from this high can’t see shit unless that matter to you
You trying to be the boy they wonder what had happened to
I tried to be the man I did more then I plan to do
I did my thing I snatched it before they could hand it to
Earthquake motor the road i’m doing damage to
The paint'll murder, the doors is suicide fool
You may die no lie, and this is very true
I’m online like a dot com
Constructing these bars like i’m building a prison
Locked in though I gotta be out of my mind
Im parked, im sparked, im chillin u can burn with me
But them niggas gotta stay outside

[Hook]

Diamond in the back, sunroof
Counting up a stack in the drive thru
Bass slapping, what the g’s ride to
Wonder what this is, it’s high tunes
Diamond in the back, sunroof
High fool!
Countin up a stack...when I ride through
Got a fifty sack in my shoe
