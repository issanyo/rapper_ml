[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Trying to get a helipad on top of this bitch
Hustling a long time

[Verse]
Bentleys out side the villas
Rose petals on the sheets
Mints on the pillows
Baby smoked out
Dancing in the mirror
Trying to draw me nearer
But I got paper love
I can't make it any clearer love
I can't make it no realer
Than the ceiling that I get from depositing millions
I love thumbing through them Benjis
Getting head on the beach
In the drop top Rolls couldn't match the feeling so
Please excuse me if I keep it moving
I know them big licks just ain't gon' come to me
So I'm on the hunt
Some people think I'm tripping, think I'm on one
This is the mentality, brutality of New Orleans
Trying to come up and share my pot with my lil dog and them
Yeah
Yeah
Trying to come up and share my pot with my lil dog and them
Its enough loot and bitches in this world for all of us
Lil homie you gotta think larger, broader
Crabs in a bucket they kill you before you touch it
That fucking money, them haters don't want to see you get none
They want you on the porch right next to them
Can't entertain these bums get on your money
Bro you'll turn into a skeleton just waiting for that bread to come
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper

[Outro]
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Get up and get to the paper
Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Get up and get to the
