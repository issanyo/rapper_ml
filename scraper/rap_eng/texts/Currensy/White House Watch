[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, roulette wheels, record deals
Sharks on land, exotic tires peel
I built this back a couple of years
Now hands clap when I appear, cheers
No scripts, these actions is real
No cap guns, them little cats will kill
Over that scratch you'll be stretched out and still
Hold your breath, this threat done gone airbourne
This shit they can't prepare for
Ya boy, I smoke one with your bitch
She rolled up seven more
Revolutionize this shit, they won't give me credit for
But acknowledgement from these suckers ain't what I'm in it for
Eating over here the logo should be a dinner fork
JLR, plenty cars
She wanna be where the Ferrari's and Lamborghini's are
Nigga you mad? You a fucking bitch, where your speedy bag?
Sucker you a cunt, where your Fendy' clutch?
Highe'd up, on my way to lunch
Valet give me a wipe down and, leave it up front
Show piece, big wings
White House, fool presidential Rollie's
Dig?, why stop when I'm living like Goldie?
Winter time, bring them fur's out
Turn your girl's out
I won't trip trip, I'mma stop for real

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
Uh, weak niggas and strong weed
Kill 'em all, thought devil sold them out if you ask me
And nigga we, untouchable, can't fuck with us
Grind family, organized crime family, legit and up
Bitch fell in lust, first time I picked her up
And took her to the store, told her get what she want
Bags underneath the hood, engine in the trunk
Show you there's money out here if that's what you want
Man an honor, drug dealer persona
Gold ropes, let them bomb us
From cash, wrap them rubberbands
To checks, with the commas
Reduction recalls, I'm used to crack stirring ?
A nigga gave me nothing, still made it with a nigga dolla'
Fucking bitches, living in public housing
To riding down on them niggas who try shitting on me
Now I'm like you dealing or using the shit homie?
Cause I be on the block, looking like I got a half a ticket on me
Look at this car, wish you would put a ticket on it
Broke niggas watch me like I got a chicken on me
And go to ? , that's when I gotta put a ticket on 'em
A price so high, I bet their baby mama off 'em
Cause niggas die everyday with no money for a coffin
Or go to jail, without no money for a lawyer
So play the shooter, or be the target
