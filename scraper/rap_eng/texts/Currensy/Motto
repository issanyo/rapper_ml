[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day imma make sure that we straight
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Money and the power and a nice place to stay
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Cruisin' in my low rider I be vibin' to [?]
Groovy ass oldies is all I play
Playa ass tunes is all I make
Coolest nigga in the room who been getting the cake
See me in my box chevy we could [?]
No raggedy sounds ain't no rattling plates
Got it out the mud trapping off them mixtapes
You started happenin' overnight that was a mistake

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day imma make sure that we straight
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Money and the power and a nice place to stay
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way

[Verse 3: Corner Boy P]
I got some brand new 6 by 9's in my car door
100 spokes Dayton cross laced triple gold
Candy dripping off it like a runny nose
Had two 10's and a beam I just got a 4
I be grinding for that money gotta heavy load
Same hustle same trap just got a better stove
All gas no breaks I'm running through them O's
I relapse in this bitch I'm finna pour a 4
Dapping for designer what my niggas on
My lil cousin doing 20 he just want a phone
For that money and that power be all in your home
I thank the Lord everyday I get to swing a pole

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day imma make sure that we straight
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Money and the power and a nice place to stay
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
What the fuck you thought
I been a boss since the start
Never falling off, sports cars racing movie stars
Grind hard, word to my dog Lito
Ferrari 430 in my South Beach clothes
Walking in the spot, standing on the couch
Valet parking lot 10 million dollars worth of drops
10 strong, we in playoff form
Going to the Finals, leaving suckas behind us
High off the finest vines when you find us
Never in your life will you find a crew like us
Watch me turn this batch into a Bentley
And I don't even need another Bentley, you feel me?

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day imma make sure that we straight
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Money and the power and a nice place to stay
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way
Every nigga with me feeling the same way
Every nigga with me living the same way
