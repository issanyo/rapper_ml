[Verse 1: Top Gunz]
Chyah
Street wizard
Fly Boy
It's a Fly Society
Just doing what I do
Look
I got the fever for the funk
The wizard bring the pressure like some speakers in your trunk
I keep it pumping
The pussy surplus player
Bitches they keep it coming
The trap star, the green leaf I keep it running
The fly boy, the situation, anticipating
In this society the women love nad niggas hating
I'm riding high under the tint of intoxication
And when I ride high the bitches glad we (?)
Its sad to say that
I one-nighted your wife
She took a one-nighted vacation
Chyah
On mammie I'm just hibernating
I'm floating through the city for this rock I'm chasing
I'm smoking on some piffy and my snaps is (?)
Nigga high in the sky and I'm fly as (?)
I try to wonder why 'cause your mind is blanking
Got her sick from the bottles and the scent that I'm making
And Imma keep it coasting through the city

[Hook: Top Gunz]
Its cast stacks and stacks that keep a nigga floating through the city
Nigga bad bitch status, dick game terrific
(?) games at chickens and nickname them bitches

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yah
I'm in the building like the first floor
Getting open like the front door
I'm getting money but I want more
I had a Jaguar but then I got bored
And I'm opting for the Porsche
Uh
I'm in the studio in St. Croix
Me and all my fly society home boys
Fly society girls is also present
Don't test those women because they pack weapons
And they hold down their men
Pounds of that purp in their air conditioning vents
To live any other way doesn't make sense
I got with Young Money I ain't looked back since
And
Pardon my language but Imma tell these bitches
"Fuck me I'm famous"
Haha
I'm young, rich, and dangerous
Iced out fly boy
Penguin bitch

Uh
Broads say I'm so fly and dapper
Such a gorgeous rapper
Please separate me from them actors
Plus my wrist glisten like it was christened by Eskimos
All assorted colors like frozen fruit and vegetables
645 green with pecan seats
Cruising the city with my evening freak
Fly boys do it large
We explore several whores in a '64
Leave from Armstrong and maybe land in Bora Bora
We get groupie love the whole click (?)
Me in a brown Range, (?) in a blue Porsche
Wiz in a Vanquish, (?) with a Diablo
Larry and Spitta up in the Mercielagos
Just cruise to some tunes what a hell of a groove
Broads say I'm one hell of a dude
Forever smiling in one hell of a mood
Flying in friendly skies
Miles high while I snooze and cruise nigga
