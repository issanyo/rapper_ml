[Curren$y: Talking]
First thing I want to say is free the homie C-Style
Then I want to say thank you to each and every one of y'all for comin' out
Checkin' out this, this audio look-book I wanna lay out for y'all this evenin'
Yea, The Spring Collection
Couple different styles
Couple things you know, little prelude of what's to come
Gon' get your rollin' trays or whatever you need
Put your cell phones on 'Do Not Disturb'
We gon' bend a few corners
Might stop and holla at a few of the homies or whatever
