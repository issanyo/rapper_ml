[Intro]
The first time we came in with the rep
Now we got that fresh seafood for everybody
That's love for the people right there
Yeah
Yeah

[Hook]
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
All I fear is God plus he's on my side
I got the angel on the hood of the car I'm driving
I'm good in the hood, you can't even slide
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody

[Verse 1]
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
All I fear is God plus he's on my side
Arriving high riding sly like the road was the sky
I got money on the line, I got more money outside
I got more dream cars than I can drive
Got more dreams in my mind
I pull it all off in due time
I break off, blessed is my grind
Cause I've been putting it in, over and over again
My team committed to win
Some we save, some we spend
Dragging furs full length
Them niggas slid in like pimps
Its like a 70's film but bitch this really how we live

[Hook]
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
All I fear is God plus he's on my side
I got the angel on the hood of the car I'm driving
I'm good in every hood, you can't even slide
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
All I fear is God plus he's on my side
I got the angel on the hood of the car I'm driving
I'm good in every hood, you can't even slide
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody

[Verse 2]
The foreigns come alive when there's hoes outside
I popped my hood she was surprised there was no motor inside
Bitch my engine in the back, this cost me 300 racks
Spitta got dollars on top of dollars
Diamonds on top of diamonds
Impalas behind Impalas
I got my Bentley blocked in
Stunt cause we know they're watching
Fuck 'em

[Hook]
I'm so fucking high I don't feel nobody
All I fear is God plus he's on my side
I got the angel on the hood of the car I'm driving
I'm good in every hood, you can't even slide
