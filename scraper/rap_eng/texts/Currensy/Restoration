[Intro: Curren$y]
Retoration
The act of restorin' back to it's original glory

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Two of the illest back in the kitchen
Fillin' prescriptions, fiends itchin'
We serve 'em through the chain linked fences
Beamers and Benzes on 24 inches
Reefer smoke thick as the tension from them bitch-ass niggas
Fuck them bitch-ass niggas, Route
They broke and they assed out, that's what they mad 'bout
While I'm in the stash house on the internet checkin' the latest project progress
They never understand my underground success
The amount of love I get, but I digress
It's obvious that I'm above all this 'cause I'm a Jet
Center Edge Territory, the collective, Mos Def and Jay Elec
Andretti fresh, a pair of thousand dollar steps
When I left I threw up my set

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
I guess everybody gangsters, everybody servin'
Everybody slangin', everybody claimin' Crip or Blood
Everybody bangin', ain't nobody tryna take the fall
They all pointin' fingers, yea I'm tryna win, I'm all out of favors
We started with nothin' so hustlin' our nature
We come from a place where a murder make you famous
We built us a business, nobody gave us naythan
The underrated, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton
Pitch a bag to the lawyer to fight the case
They got me back in the kitchen without the apron
Bucket low like fuck it though
Hell yea, I'm fresh up out the gutter but she love it though
Money in the envelope

[Verse 3: Street Wiz]
Arm full of riches we been evicted
Shit been official, that there my status you know the business
Convince the kid to get on a track and we go to spittin'
It's Cleopatra, you know we at it, come get a listen
Best pay attention, this is a dynasty in the building
We hit the stage, they up to the front, they tryna get pictures
It's lemonade that's up in the air, we keep it too litty
The bitches stare when we hit the place, we come to get busy
No time to spare, it's 3-2-1, back to the mission
We blowin' on something different, dispensary flavor hittin'
We leave you in the past, the jealous be shiftin' different
The schedule full of digits, you guess it but it was written
Ba-bang
