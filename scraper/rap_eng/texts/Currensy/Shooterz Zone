Skyline of the city where they repaired the Super Dome
And National Guard troopers roam
Because of this it's still the shooters zone
Because a lot of the wiling niggas is movin home
And they hungry homie, they only skin and bones
And they gotta eat something
And I'm getting money
So I probably look like a turkey and corn bread stuffing
To a little nigga with nothin in his stomach
That's why I don't wear more than that ice when I'm out stuntin
Cause niggas know my rights and I'm licensed to carry somethin
You could take a chance with your life when your out in public
Be cool as the fuck but everybody don't love ya
Nigga's dont wanna see ya with it
Dressed all glittered, impressing the bitches
Smilin in your pictures, wiling with all ya niggas
Coppin' Dodge Chargers as gifts for ya killers
Nigga's just livin
But wolves on the outside lookin in
And they just trying to bring ya good times till the end
Cancel your show, make this your last season
Senseless murders that never really had reason
You will shine and have wood nearly tweeking
He was jealous and that second you was not breathing
That's why I drop like rain
In and out the club before the DJ even say my name
Cause I ain't gotta stay long
Only thing I'm looking for is something to take home
Jack boys faking like they talking on a pay phone
Slipping at the red light, end up with your face gone

[Hook]
So much on my mind I just can't recline
And I done tried to quit smoking about a million times
Breath in, listening to beats as they play
Breath out, after I think of what I'm bout to say
Ahhhhh
Now I'm right back where I said I'd never go again
Sun roof opening, moon light poking in
Haters I'm scoping them
Dippin with the A
Cause even cool niggas fall victim to the streets

[Outro]
Oh niggas think its a game out there
Boy, man this motherfucker look like a fuckin straight forest nigga
You will get your head knocked off anywhere
I will give a fuckin, some old guy just got killed taking a piss
Outside an abandoned house
You better be lookin out nigga
Because it's goin down
Oh niggas think it's a game?
