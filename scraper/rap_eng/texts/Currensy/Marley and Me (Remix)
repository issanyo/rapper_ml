[Chorus]
All my smokers get high with me, just all you need
Is smoking on the Kush, or the Sour D
(Light it!)
And smoke and ride with me
Now salute
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute
To all my potheads around the world

(Smoke DZA)
I roll up something; nah, I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go; I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy
Yeah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant
This sale, off the Audemar
You go to coppin', only ordered one!
I go to coppin', and they throw me some
It's like that
This for my piss-test failures who won't leave it alone
Shoutout to Ricky Williams and Pacman Jones

(Chorus)

(Devin The Dude)
Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors
No
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like...[long, deep hit, goofy laugh]...kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I went and bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe throughout the room, and equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

(Chorus)

(Curren$y)
The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in...
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive; do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

(Chorus)

(Asher Roth)
Smoke fills the room, as soon as I put my two boat shoes in
Then I'm floating in slow motion
Know my M.O
Always roll with homegrown, same color as Leno
It's Widow white, yeah, my eyes low as pebbles
Get in the zone, you know I flow in it forever
There's never
No effort
Forget it
The memory's been severed
Why take the shaky shit when I can give it to you fresher?
Yessir, that's Asher, chillin' in a sweatshirt
Smoking on some shit that they be giving to the lepers
Nevertheless, I'm an open-mind accepter
Respecter of the cess, yes, collector of the best herb
I smoke weed, no need to give a lecture
Still can't believe it's illegal, for the record
The way I see it, it makes me think better
Sinks in deep, and makes me think that I'll
Release the feet beneath of me and let the weed speak to me
Hear it in the beat, I see it leakin' from the frequency
And frequently, a freak like me
Figures out the secrecy
Feels the need to plant the seed in each and every human being
Cocaine and E will only take away your decency
Caffeine and nicotine secretly can weaken me
Can't you see, the key ingredient'd be the THC?
[Puff]
Sativa's all you need...

(Chorus)
