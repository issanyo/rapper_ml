Never has there ever been a fella on the level that I stand
With the power to destroy the whole world in one hand, or so they say
Because the things we say influence the children today
But who the fuck are they
And if they were spending more time teaching their children the difference between right and wrong
Then they wouldn't have to learn life's lesson through a song
Cause truthfully I do believe it starts in a home
And it carries to when you're grown
From there I will move on
Don't wanna seem to smart
Cause niggas get assassinated
For being too educated
You know the fuzz are played
Dave Chapelle said to sprinkle coke on a body, make it drug related
Information that you niggas better get updated
Can't be scared to change
Gotta welcome it with open wings
They making up the rules as they go but i'm the one keeping the score, let's roll
