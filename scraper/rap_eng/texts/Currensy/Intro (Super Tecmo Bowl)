Another month
Another mixtape
Last month it was Fear and Loathing in New Orleans
The month before that
I welcomed ya'll to the winners cirlce
A month before that
I took you higher than 30,000
And the month before that
I declared my independence
But this right here
Is one that's near and dear to me
Super Tecmo Bowl
I took a minute on putting this out
I held it for a couple days
But now I think ya'll ready
Roll something up
Pour something up
I don't even think I gotta tell ya'll that no more
You already know what you getting into
So with no further ado
No more hurdles, no more hold ups
I'll let you get into it
FS Jets
Where haven't we been yet?
