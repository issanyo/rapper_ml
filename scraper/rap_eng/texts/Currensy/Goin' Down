[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Game have a nigga paranoid
All this paper, scared to enjoy
Cause them niggas'll hate you for it
But fuck that, I got plains to board
Shows to rock, cars to cop
Hoes to give to my OGs like here just live
Rest it on the shoulders of the stoned high roller
On the low-low, smokin' on some do-do from the left coast
Jet Cold niggas that grind more
Another week, another musical key, all for free
Ain't nothin' the G fool yo' pimpin' whackin'
Yo ho's comin' to me, now ya want her back, but she won't leave
I don't blame her, put her on the set
We just nicknamed her, Teacher's Pet
I put her on, showed her how, she hit a lick
The night that she get home it's goin' down

[Hook]
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it's goin' down
Goin' down tonight
Tonight it's goin' down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight it's goin' down
It's goin' down tonight
Tonight is when it's goin' down
