[Verse 1]
Took my jacket off as I slid to the car
Exiting  the sports arena like a star
Use the talent elevator to the rooftop office
That's how you know you made it
Rubbing elbows with the life changers
Shaking hands with the strangers
Hanging 'round motherfuckers more dangerous than strangers
Shit trill
I pray for my cousins who be banging
Hope that rap shit clicks
But that paper won't stop my loved ones from hanging
Rest in peace to the Jacka
Keep them Chevy's swanging
Burn the rubber at the traffic light for entertainment
Killed the beat, showed up torched to the arraignment
Higher than a spaceship
Your honor in amazement
Couldn't even say shit
Let a nigga skate back to the interstate quick
All in the cake mix but never get the game twisted
Never coming up on lame shit

[Hook]
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Stash a couple pounds at your house for me

[Verse 2]
Rolls Royce came through like Theraflu, nasty as fuck
Bentleys pulled up too
Shot callers on entourage members in the coupe
Trying to catch us slipping, but your bitch gave us the scoop
(?) to the loot we be on the move
Anything about it, you probably not even that cool
All I do is roll killa at the house on shrooms
Made a million dollars staying fresh and being true
Underground niggas, couple cribs, couple pools
Might piss in the mainstream, take ya'll money too
What the fuck dumb niggas gonna do?

[Hook]
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Stash a couple pounds at your house for me

Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
I'm a real nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Right back in this bitch like I left my keys
I'm a real ass nigga, bounce-bounce for me
Stash a couple pounds at your house for me
