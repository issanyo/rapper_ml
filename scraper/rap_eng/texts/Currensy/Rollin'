[Intro]


[Verse 1]
What they call me, Hot Spitta, OG
I run the most rhymes out of New Orleans
I'm hella cool, I’m not a fool
I got so many styles, nigga I could give one to you
When I roll through the town I holla at my niggas
Be the most asked question, "How I got them figures?"
"How I got them bitches?" and the answer is
I just do me homeboy that’s all I did
I grind like gears in my Nova
[?] bowties [?]
Niggas was right behind me until I floated
Now they couldn’t find me with a telescopic focus

[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll

Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll

[Verse 2]
Suckers pop shit don’t bother me dawg
Y'all pussies talking like vagina monologue
Run your bitch to the set, to break my dawgs off
Big blower out the hood like a funny car
Nigga say I sound like who? You sound like trash
Get off my dick and pass my cash
Bitches wanna be on my arm like elbow pads
And go to the A Life store on Melrose Ave
Bitches from the past see Spitta and get mad
Look at magazine covers and see what they once had
I’m rolling with something bad, she down for the cause
Crack the sunroof, blow the smoke in the stars
A rebel with a cause, my joystick broke
I can’t press pause
Captain of the Jets, spitta nigga, Brett Favre
Wack videos make me turn my television off
And keep the joints rolling like the wheels on a Porsche

[Hook]
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll

Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll
