[Intro]
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, Lil Snupe, Big L
2Pac, Biggie, Lil Derrick, Pimp C, Yellow Boy, Eazy-E
Got me feelin like
This weed got me feelin like
This money got me feelin like

[Verse 1]
I'm hella high and these niggas so jive
Hate in they eyes as I drive by, but never will I ask why
It must just suck to be a never fly, underling
This is a boss thing, and these are boss rings
Sunshine on my fingers through the windows of the Gulf Stream
What you know G? Hoe, you don't know me
41 millimeter Rollie, tryna be low key
Please, them bitches spotted me soon as I slid in
I had my girl with me it ain't make them hoes no different
They was still tryna get it
But you ain't gotta lie to kick it
Might be down with it, if she dig ya
I'm outside with the killas, talkin peace
In the breeze, smoking weed but next week I'm Snow Beach Polo Skis
Four inch freeze, me in the prime of my life
I made the hustle and my bitch become sister-wives
And now the love is intertwined, money on my mind'

[Outro]
Got me feeling like 8 Ball, MJG and Too $hort was all on one tape Lord
Got me feeling like, Jay-Z, AZ, Nas, Rick Ross, Scarface was all on one tape Lord, got me feeling like
Tha Dogg Pound, Nipsey Hussle, DJ Quik and MC Eiht was all on one tape dawg, Lord
Got me feeling like OutKast, Cam'ron and Lil Wayne was all on one tape Lord, got me feeling like
All on one tape
Like they was all on one tape Lord, got me feelin like
Soulja Slim, Pimp C -- all on one tape Lord, got me feeling like
2 Pac, Bigge Smalls, Eazy-E was all on one tape Lord
Got me feeling like
And Dilla did the beats
Max B
And then DJ Screw slowed it up
Dom Kennedy
Then Jam Master Jay did some scratches on it
Big K.R.I.T., Killer Mike, Slim Thug, Gunplay
All on one tape Lord
