New Orleans everyday all right (x3)
Cuz they show love when I did it myself

[Verse 1:]
Yeah, park the car open the door slide my feet out
Sneak another pull in before I put the weed out
You know what I be bout Nike head but I own a couple pairs of Reeboks
Throwback, it's the Pump fury, now if it would please the jury
May I present the evidence that Spitter is hotter than whoever?
I call em common critters , I do not consider them competitors
I put em on ice like I'm dressing my bezel up
My bitch told me "Baby I think they scared of you"
I use they necks to build a ladder I step up
Sucka ass niggas thought they had me I crept up, and thats where they messed up
Don't e-mail or send a text message, if you wasn't around when a nigga was stressing
Talk your ass off but you can't lock my blessing
Every hurdle that I crossed I was learning a lesson
Putting on for my city like Jeezy and Kanye
My future so bright I limo tinted my shades
Helicopter shades fucking up my girls hairdo
Helipad on a Superdome roof yeah

New Orleans everyday all right
Cuz they show love when I did it myself

[Verse 2:]
Uh, the hottest nigga in the street
You ain't gotta ask boss, 17 chevys
With my label advance cooler Hot Wheels off with my frosty hands them haters getting sick of you man
Bitches wanna save the last dance, I'm cool
My home boy Mel gave me these shoes, you crazy? won't fuck up these spikes for you baby
Plus these the red black and green ones, the mean ones I was watching MTV when I first seen them
Niggas ain't similar to the Hot Spitter or the way I sling these syllables
Fuck around with him and your condition will be critical
Jive ass niggas who talk that shit about the crew
Til I come around then they hit me with "What's happening fool?"
Get lost off a short cliff take a walk
Number crunch ball park figures
Bout to buy a major league ballpark nigga
I do it for my city cuz my city made me realer
Curren$y da Hot Spitta if you know somebody sicka you better call the bioteam to quarantine that nigga
