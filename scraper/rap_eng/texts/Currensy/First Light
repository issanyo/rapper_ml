Yeah

La Musica de Harry Fraud

Yeah

[Curren$y]
Exiting the striker boat
Clean as fuck, eatin' millions and shittin' soap
Its in the ceilings, its in the walls, its in the floor
That's old news, the real drugs is in the flow
Gold shoes, Dayton spokes on the 94
Fleet wood, my weed and fucking my bottom bitch, help me sleep good
G's spent on that motor work, monsters under these hoods
Clique too thick for you to see through it, you know how we do it
Way different from them, momma who let them in
Undesirables non-viablel, this is what them bosses flick them lighters to

[Bridge: Curren$y and Smoke DZA]
Yeah, Yeah
This is Harlem and New Orleans
This is old schools and drop foreigns

Right

This that first smoke of the morning
This that shit you always wanted

Right

I hope you suckas are ready for it
You know your bitches waiting on it

This is Harlem in New Orleans
This is old schools and drop foreigns

[Smoke DZA]
Riiiiiight, fuck the fame, give me the money and bud
Nigga could walk trough Harlem and its nothin' but love
A1 under these rap gods that's fuckin' with us
They don't even look cool, most of these niggas is sus
You rockin' with the innovators, imitated, never duplicated
If you don't fill that then , chances is you a hater
I can smell a motherfucka that's jealous, look at you
All in your feelings, you can't help it
Nigga look at the ground where real niggas round
I can see through the fake love and fake pounds
I ain't trippin I don't kick it wit em
No verses they can copy, as long as they got the ticket for it
DZA
