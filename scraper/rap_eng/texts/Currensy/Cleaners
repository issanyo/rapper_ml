[Intro]
Yeah
Rap city shit

[Chorus]
Bring a mop witchu
Alkali water in my watch drip icicles
Big pedeller, no bicycles
Hot spitter, rhyme slicker
Plus the cars that I drive quicker
Lamborghini door lift up
Porsche Carrera paddle shifter
Expensive equipment
You niggas don't get it 'cause you ain't got it

This coolness can't be cultured you must be born with it
Embedded in the bones of your body
DNA make me move in a player way
Kick that dope shit I never use my feet to clout chase
These niggas want the easy road to the chump change
I travelled rougher terrain towards a pot of gold
Too much paper to ever have a bank roll
Skyscrapers we build with the hundred dollar bills
Super straight but I'm still on the grind for real
Cause I can't chill, sleep please
Nigga I don't know how that feel
Stay woke
Bring your motherfucking coat
You scared you can stay indoors
Money outside
But there's also the risk of homicide
Gentrification, niggas in displacement, frustration, and genocide
But this is life so we must strive
Real music last forever my nigga and this is how we never die
Long as we create some fly shit in our lifetime
Park the sports car in the sunshine
All visualized in my mind
My daydreams turn into real things
Catching big stunts in the nighttime
Smoke big dope, write rhymes
In between lines
Dope quotes in the meantime
In green lime M5
Killed the scene like a driveby, Eastside

[Chorus]
Bring a mop witchu
Alkali water in my watch drip icicles
Big pedeller, no bicycles
Hot spitter, rhyme slicker
Plus the cars that I drive quicker my nigga
Lamborghini door lift up
Porsche Carrera paddle shifter
Expensive equipment
You niggas don't get it 'cause you ain't got it
