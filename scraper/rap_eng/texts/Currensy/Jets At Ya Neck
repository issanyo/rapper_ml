Jet life jet life jet life jet life

[Verse 1 Curren$y]
Yeah, G'r then youv'e ever been and everywhere you never went
A decorated veteran
My bitches keep it very trill say they swagga jackin daddy
I say fuck it baby girl we gon' let him live
Too much money not enough time to get it and want power before they drop the ball
Brand new socks and long jon draws I want it all
My young nigga told y'all it's getting cold out here dog
Bundle up motherfuck being the runner-up
4 niggas deep the number one is us
Text homie and tell him his number's up
You services are no longer needed
Rocka bye baby word to Kesha
Broad day jets and monsta beats kill niggas on tape
Many a track has met his fate at the hands of Spitta Andretti
Them niggas is half way shook and all the way not ready

Chorus:
And I'm gon' keep on driving and smoking
Long as baby keep rolling them nice ones up and passing 'em over to me
I done it how my triple O showed me
Smile when I ride by, they proud of a grown me
The climb was lonely
Got to the top and I stood there on my own feet
2
Trill niggas form the best crew now it's jets at ya motherfuckin' neck fool

[Verse 2: Trademark da Skydiver]
Sharvees on my feet
Cacky LRG jets fitted trees sticky
Just riding around the city smoking O's like fifties
Mind on a milli
Eyes on a rearview cause these haters out to get me
Fuck 'em, I just duck 'em like the bitch that was just with me
Simply I'm on a level where these lames can't gain no entry
Yeah, I stay high I dont fly on empty
Fill my lungs up with blueberry sour and piffy
Life of a jet bad bitches and good weed
Fast cars and glass jars of sour D's
Uhh TMSD the SV
Hover over land lovers like a g3
Jets nigga from the net to the tv
We came up quick and made this shit look easy
Yeah, now they go in cop my cd
Put 'em in they deck and ride around with them on repeat

Chorus:
And I'm gon' keep on driving and smoking
Long as baby keep rolling them nice ones up and passing 'em over to me
I done it how my triple O showed me
Smile when I ride by, they proud of a grown me
The climb was lonely
Got to the top and I stood there on my own feet

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
And it's jets over everything
I put that on everything
We been doing our thing anyway
Nigga slash anywhere
First let me twist this up I'mma tell my driver take me there
Secondly and back to back in and out I came prepared
Flashback dejavu coulda swore I saw this shit right here
Marley told me kill this shit just don't forget your niggas here
Bet I won't I done see blood sweat so many tears
Bet I blow
That's a fact point blank period
Break her off bust her up spread them legs up in the air
Slow it down and speed it up she tell me keep on drilling it
Show your right I keep it real
Something I'm familiar with
Money coming, money going
Man I keep on peeling it
My jet set camp
But really though what's really good
She know I'm dealing shit
She smell me dog, she dig my style, gangsta and gentlemen
I'm good like my jet insurance keep me with benefits

Chorus:
And I'm gon' keep on driving and smoking
Long as baby keep rolling them nice ones up and passing 'em over to me
I done it how my triple O showed me
Smile when I ride by, they proud of a grown me
The climb was lonely
Got to the top and I stood there on my own feet

[Verse 4: Whizz]
Street wizzy money
Hoes and check clothes
Blowing on that fruity pebble shit that will have your throat chokin'
We ain't trippin' in this section full of cloud 9
Floaters is a crush I'm up in my zone
You already know see my grind
It's all up in my mind
I come up with designs that attack a nigga mental
Now they keeping off my rhyme, it's finesse
It ain't nothing less cause I don't waste time
Steady sippin' in the city money gettin' I'm fly
If you look up in the air you will not see me I'm so high
Bitch I'm perfect when I glide it's like a nerve up in the sky
Twisting turning ya holdin pussy shit for my land acrobat
Blink a eye and miss a act
Stacks up in the leather sack
