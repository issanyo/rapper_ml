[Beat Drops]

[Hook]
Day by day, we realize
Crime pays
More than 99 ways
Hunnid (hundred)  proof anything I say (anything I say)
100 coupes, we come through you make way (you make way)
100 troops in Dickies suits, you'll be amazed (you'll be amazed)
At how well the game played
It's JETS everyday
Crew not fucking around mayne - it's ball-game
Crew not fucking around mayne - it's ball-game

[Verse: Curren$y]
Images vivid, mental pictures
Picket fences, 12 cylinders
Exotic women
Dat money got me trippin'
Daredevil diamond angel pendants
Star-studded vineyards
Top dogs in attendance
Luxurious cars parked in front the buildings
From my cell-phone I start my engine
Quentin Tarantino screen-written how I'm spittin'
Smoking pictures, moving movements
Movement is getting bigger
1 of the livest niggas living until them suckas try to kill him
Even if they did my spirit would still...
Ride on dem niggas
You can't hide from the realest
Corporation never ending

Crew not fucking around mayne - it's ball-game
Crew not fucking around mayne - that's y'all playing

Crew not fucking around mayne - it's ball-game
Crew not fucking around mayne - that's y'all playing

[Outro]
Undefeated like my sweats - untouchable rep
Underrated, over hated - fuck 'em
I'm a JET
