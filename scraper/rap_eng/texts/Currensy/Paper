[Intro]
Yeah
La di da da
La do da da
Yeah had it right on site... right here

[Verse 1]
Bought a '65 Eldorado on sight
Interior cleaner than Clorox
Slanted on forgiatos the same night
Text your bitch like lil' mama I'm outside
Nigga you know she for sure gone ride
6 drugs got her rolling like a motorbike
Bitch popping like a wheelie hold on tight
She excited to have a real player in her life
She did it all in my car
She left her bra in my car
Acting like a main stage lady like I had a titty bar in my car
Porn star in my car
Bring her back to you like a rented suburban that me and my dogs smoked herb and swerved in
Cold game but I had to play
When I learned how much the winners get paid
Get money nigga what you say huh!

[Hook]
Paper paper paper
What I'm talking bout
Paper paper paper
What's it all about
Roll it up on paper
Write it down on paper
Turn that into paper
Spend that on a scraper
Aim it like a lazer
Fire at a hater
Talking bout paper

[Verse 2]
I bought the rolls Royce on site
And if I talk about it too much I already apologize
I said sorry but they still mad stunt harder
Hit the crib with the expansion garage larger
Made room for the '75 with the targa
Top, But it won't stop nigga never falling
Off cause I'm the plug like I'm the charger
Plotting to have all this or own part of
Any money mission that was well thought of it
Heist every night rough Sketches at breakfast
By lunch time we'll have it all perfected
Execute at night fall
We all eat dinner fit for kings at the Players ball
Another jooks Another trout on the hook
Who's shit finna get took
What I'm talking bout

[Hook]
Paper paper paper
What I'm talking bout
Paper paper paper
What's it all about
Roll it up on paper
Write it down on paper
Turn that into paper
Spend that on a scraper
Aim it like a lazer
Fire at a hater
Talking bout paper

[Outro]
This that 1987 Miami vice
Boats on Biscayne bay type shit
This that Sonny Crockett in over his head type shit
Sharks in the water type shit
Yeah
