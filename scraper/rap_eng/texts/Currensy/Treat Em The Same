[Hook: Curren$y]
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
That's just how the game played
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
No feds
That's just how the game played

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Dime a dozen, going comin'
Flossin', stuntin'
Them hoes love it, want more of it
From the oven, dress
My sweatpants they the same brand as my luggage
High end chilling
Jet living, Sachs Fifthing
Shopping, sipping, kinda tipsy
Bumped into something bad walking past Tiffany & Co
By tonight I'll have her doing as I say though
Four switches gold Daytons on my stagecoach
Pretty things classy hoes get slayed all the same
Got game from my big bro
Spitta in your house what's the zip code
I Heard they got some freaky lil' women next door
Fo sho

[Hook: Curren$y]
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
That's just how the game played
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
No feds
That's just how the game played

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
True player, true blues, true to the game
Hard floors, Rollie dial, golden champagne
Game recognize, the real realize
Rims on little tires, candy bowties
Parking lot landlords when we brang 'em out
Can't take these ho's to the crib, you know they'll run they mouths
Got one tinted, pull it over when I dig her out
And roll me one, drop her off won't even smoke her out
I got a bitch that will leave me almost every night
So bad bitches come and go when your money right
And I'm in Balmain like it's Polo, all my Nikes is white
Oh I ain't nothing nice, I'm trynna fuck tonight
Awnser that text just don't miss this jet hoe
Still got old money, Jordan Retros
Never pressed but I'mma need it like the same day
Treat 'em all the same way, planes on the runway

[Hook: Curren$y]
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
That's just how the game played
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
No feds
That's just how the game played
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
That's just how the game played
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
No feds
That's just how the game played

[Outro: Curren$y]
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
Treat 'em all the same way
That's just how the game played
