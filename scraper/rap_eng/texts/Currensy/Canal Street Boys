[Intro]
(I won't stand for this)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
300 grand on it
Pull up to the show, hop out and stand on it

[Verse]
300 grand on it
Pull up to the show, hop out and stand on it
Did my dance on it
Don't try to copy me, fuck up your advance homie
You're not the same, your hustle must expand homie
If I like where I land then I cop land
Nice crib with a pool and I party plan
Them bitches comin' where it's money
They ain't have to have it, they just wanna touch it
Had three of my Rollies on when we was fuckin'
Cause I ain't trust (?) to come up, move for these suckers
I'm way above 'em
Staying high, my name buzzin'
That's from that stuntin'
They thought me not to be a factor
But now they love 'em
Heard I'm dabbling in some acting, that's more money
Every angle of the game I attack, it's all covered
Came through in that summer rain coupe
It was island water blue
If you broke, you never knew, you never in the loop
I'm ballin' out, too small to be playin' hoops
I'm still slam dunkin' Chevrolets on stainless shoes
Double S Impala yeah bitch I'm seeing twos
Double S Impala yeah bitch I'm seeing twos
My diamonds reflecting different hues
I tell my girl to run upstairs and switch her jewels
Put your evening wear on we making night moves
She watch me sign a big deal in her Giuseppe heels
Shit straight, I always knew this was how I would feel
I ain't always had that paper but I been real

[Outro]
Keep it in, Chevy on switches nigga
We smokin' weed in it, laughin' in our pictures
Keep it in, Chevy on switches nigga
We smokin' weed in it, laughin' in our pictures
Laughin' in our pictures, cause niggas really get hit
Wouldn't talk about if niggas wasn't livin' it
If you need to see it you can come and visit
Yeah niggas that's the difference
Keep it in, Chevy on switches nigga
We smokin' weed in it, laughin' in our pictures
Keep it in, Chevy on switches nigga
We smokin' weed in it, laughin' in our pictures
