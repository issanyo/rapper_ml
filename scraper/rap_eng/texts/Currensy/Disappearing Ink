Yeah x5

[Verse 1 Curren$y]
Uh Shit so dark you need night vision just to listen
Disappearing ink it was written hieroglyphics
Niggas lookin' like clones all saying they tryin' to be different
Reflection
So deceptive theres too much smokey mirrors

I'm stoned on my own playing oldies from my phone
Bluetooth in the coupe cost the price of a home
Always gone
Money mission neverending went through hell to get it
Spend them digits on princess flooded religious pendants

My mommas prayers keep me from dealing with deceitful niggas
I seent them niggas dawg and you was with em'
I wrote these rhymes to the sounds of you snakes slithering
I seent it like a flow model zenith

33 inch bro I mean it tho
Things can get real quick while I just play it how it go
Learnt that in the NO
Rap hustling fa sho
Bitches in and out revolving doors diggin' for gold

While Im mobbin' in the side with no piece on my figaro
Diamonds on the lobster class just a light splash

[Verse 2 Styles P]
Jet life block life
Whens the next flight?
Fuck the cop lights
600 horses right at the stoplight

Got you thinkin' when will the lights stop
6 for a nice whip
5 for a nice watch
7 for a nice crib
Live at the night spot
Homies with the dope nikes
Chicks with the nice drops

Moet in the ice bucket
Know he bout to light pot
Kush and the raw cone
Ringers with doors off and doors on
Eithers its peace or itâ€™s a warzone
With alchemist and curren$y with alchemist and curren$y

Mommy told me flourish
But money could never nourish me
So I got the juice like Q did
What you did
You ain't sayin nothing doing nothing you just frontin'
Had my nigga push a button with a ratchet and a new clip

That shit a hit your ear like a qtip
We just tryin to chill and get stoned off this glue shit
