[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I live it, you make it up, like the motherfuckin' difference
Homeboy, that's the motherfuckin' difference
Check my stitchin', soft leather interior
Arachnophobia, I trumped that, and tamed the spider engine, I made a pet out that
Parked it in my living room, made a couch out that
Conversation piece, gonna talk about that
Foolish industry beef, we gonna be nowhere round that
We just count money, send the younging to the out back
With a wad of 20's and the keys to the Cadillac truck
Tell them bring some food back, then go and do some young nigga stuff
But he said he'd rather hang around us
Soakin' game up, the same way I came up

Same way I came up
Game given from a OG point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you
Ahh, game given from my OG point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you

[Verse 2: Berner]
I'm listenin' to the OG speaking, middle of November, outdoor season
I'm thinking bout this money yeah this money got me thinking
And the shit that I'm breathing on got me day dreaming
I'm amazed, beautiful girls will sell they soul
Just to come home with me, after my show
Got her sitting in the room, just waiting on them cars
While I'm trying to avoid the police sniffin' dogs
Make the pack sale, press one button
Make the hash melt. me and my bitch and my vac seal
I was in a room with 3 felons and a killer
2 dope fiends a prostitute and a dealer
They said Bern, you a hundred dollar billa'
And my hash is black and yellow like a Pittsburgh steeler

This is real game given from a trapper's point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you
That's the way that I came up
Game given from a trapper's point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you
That's the way I came up
That's game given from a trapper's point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you
Aha, this is real game given from a OG point of view
Usually I sell it but I got enough to share with you
