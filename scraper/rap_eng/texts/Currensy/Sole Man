[Chorus]
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-H-O-O-T-T spitta, I can’t be compared to these niggas

[Verse 1]
Back in the days in the city of New Orleans
Before we had a basketball team called the Hornets
The hustlers on the block was the only ones balling
Every day I saw ‘em floating something that I wanted
Riding up the block, top dropped, engine roaring
Pitch a little kid twenty bucks to wash it for ‘em
I used to sit on the block and listen to ‘em talking
About how expensive it was to ride foreign
Those I admire added fuel to the fire
But when Soulja Slim came up, I really got inspired
Switched it into overdrive when I heard him rhyming
Then my brother got a deal and then I figured that I could and then I did
But it’s kind of crazy in the music biz
Chances slim, they’re shady in the music biz
Props to Eminem because he made it in the music biz
Walked my eight mile in the land of the Katrinians
I got a style that a lot of people don’t get
But hipsters and skateboarders digging it
It’s funny how I’m making money from this written shit
In elementary they tried to fail me for my penmanship
Now I’m thinking through the ink and it’s making me rich
But executive infections is making me sick
Antibiotics to fight it, yeah, I’m taking the shit
My doctor prescribed it, I tried it, I’m shaking and shit
I read the same rap handbook as Q-Tip
The part that hit me the hardest said this:
“Industry Rule #180: the one’s you think are helping are hating,”
Watch your back whenever you’re stepping out
If you bring the jewels out, you better bring the weapons out
And if you walk into a room, be cool, knowing you the dude everybody’s checking out

[Chorus]
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-H-O-O-T-T spitta, I can’t be compared to these niggas

[Verse 2]
Now here’s a funky introduction of how nice I am
Spitta gets you instant cash like a money gram
Curren$y the hot spitter, high grade pot getter
You broke? Still copping smoke by the gram
Went dumb when I got my first hundred grand (dumb)
Blew it all on kicks for me and my fam (dumb)
Ran through it in a week, I was behaving like the loot wasn’t a advance
In full swing like a pimp’s backhand
Got it out for these jokers like Batman
Shoot for the moon dude, because even if you miss
In the midst of the stars is where you’ll land
Hella cool, I grew up around hooligans
I did my dirt but I was nerdy with the foolishness
I rigged snack machines for free cash and drinks
Got into trouble, my mama got me back in school again
Now I’m all grown up, trying to be blown up
King Kong billboard signs gone up
Bearing my likeness, no one is like this
King of the kicks, your royal dunk highness
I’m after the treasure like pirates
No matter the weather, we climb over the climate
F.S. Jetset pilot, flow ill, snatch fly airborne virus

[Chorus]
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-O-T spitta
H-H-O-O-T-T spitta, I can’t be compared to these niggas
