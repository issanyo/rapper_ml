[Intro]
You niggas scared of monsters (Jets, nigga)
This beat right here is a monster
Them niggas scared of monsters (Jets, bitch)

[Verse 1]
You already know what weed do to my mind, fool
Make stars align when I step in the sound booth
Rhyme patterns dripping battery acid on the tablet
Letters etched in stone resting next to my phone
Best I be left alone when I'm resting on my throne
Writing that's exciting you, upset cause your girl like it
I guess I'm a psychic, I told you that I would do it
Credit Spitta for repping New Orleans hard in his music
I was cool with Master P when Eddie Griffin was foolish
Paid a California girl that was into Karma Sutra
Don't believe in Santa Claus, but I believe in monsters
They'll beat your head off if I leave you around 'em
Stay within your bounds, some of them city niggas clowning
I'm just looking down from my private terrace, lounging
You just looking down cause I'm steady up climbing
So high, I feel the temperature drop in the climate

[Hook]
Cause niggas scared of monsters
Them niggas scared of monsters
This beat right here is a monster

[Verse 2]
Sweatpants and Bo Jackson's
Listening to Pac's teardrops and closed caskets
Story got told that was oh so tragic
Every day in the presence the same shit happens
Nigga get clapped and retaliation follow
Homie kill whoadie, whoadie's homie's gonna kill homie tomorrow
Oblivious hood, I ride in my Monte Carlo
Pinning my rhymes of happiness, not sorrow
So I don't shift from sugar niggas, a pusher
That's why when my brother offered me a burner I took it
Pray I never have to use it but I keep it baby
Cause it seems the cool niggas getting killed lately
And I'll be damned, never mind, I'll put it behind
Delorean doing eighty five, I travel through time
That's how I got that old game, leaning on the Azure
Mama said nice car, I'm like this old thing?

[Hook]
