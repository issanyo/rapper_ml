[Verse 1]
Uh, all white Air Force 1 mids
Pickin lyrics into stoned ears
Out the stratosphere, anything aware
Rock it then leave it alone before attack of the clones
Stuffin' bones with California grown
Same cologne smell throughout my home
High end, clothes that I'm steady getting high in
Burned holes in my Bape sweats, buy em again
Momma green she gone
Momma grinned then we in the same car going home
I'm in the building make it known
Light that killa, nobody got that gas like yo nigga
Start a truck with it from the villa to the village
Only thing changed was my clothes and my tennis
What up with it
