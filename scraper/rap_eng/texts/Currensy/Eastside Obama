(Ah Shit!)
(I ain't have no lighter.. what happened to the damn lighter?)
(Fuck it, let me see something maybe I can nail this.)

Andretti in this bitch
And I'm already rich
But I'm still on the grind
So much more for me to get
Another crib
Another player backyard
Another fence
Another million dollar whip
Profit a hundred percent
What I get, for sure
I could afford the store
Rollie for my saints homie cause his game ice cold
That's my nigga
AK
Same way I make plays, same way I'm in the field
I'm a fuckin money train
Told niggas how to hustle
How to carve they own lane
Told niggas be themselves
Told them never be afraid
The industry full of lames
Underground really flame
Same paper as them major labels though we not the same
Independent bout it, bout it, homie shout out to the tank
Foreign car money spent that on my jet life chain

(Fuck that, that's bout it.)
(We gon keep that.)
(That's it.)
(Ha-Ha)

In this bitch
And I'm already rich
