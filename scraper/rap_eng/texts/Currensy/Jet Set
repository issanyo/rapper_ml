Another day another dolla
Wake up bake up hop in hop outta da shower
Get fresh then I spark up the sour
Call roddy told him its time to get ours
I'm out for mine, on the grind every hour
Lame niggas dont wanna se us with the power
Fake friends, I'm better off without 'em
And these hoes ain't shit so I ain't trying to be bothered
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
Talking dollas how I'm gonna get me some
At the end of the day we only live life once
I keep my head in the clouds and my mind high up
I gotta get all whats mine before times up
I'm trying to eat jacksons for breakfast, franklins for lunch
Money stacks like snacks (something) for brunch
By any means for the green in god we trust

Chorus
Im slightly woozie off the doobie
My jet life is like a movie, stay heated like jacuzzis
In the wind like a cool breeze
Flying high invincible jet ain't nothing that can do me

Young Roddy
We lit but momma still twistin
When (chaz)? gave me the game homie I paid attention
I never let a broad knock me off my mission
Cuz I be trying to save it she be tryin to spend it
Lil nigga so what I'm big business
Jet set (something) me, fuck around make my hit list
Now when I speak they all listen in this whack world I remain authentic
And as far as lames I kept my distance
Ask my nigga spitta if roddy spit vicious
My city will turn lil girls to women
Real quick turn a lil nigga into a menace
I'm no meech I think I'm trademark I'm a villain
Cuz when that money get low I start illin
Back to having d boy visions
All for the love of drug dealing

Chorus (2x)

Curren$y
Spitta nigga in your beat I get on I get off into my zone
Thinking we got 7 grams left of that zone
Bout to call my girl and tell her bring another one from home
I get it on like the power button on the television remote
So ho roll with us or you'll choke on the jet smoke
Niggas know the jet smoke the best from both coasts
I got plugs like an extension cord cuz
Spitta nigga bring it back like you fucked up my order at the drive thru
Can a nigga really rap homie your the devils from do blue
Ride up the block bitches try to jump in thru the sun roof
Thats so true
And I ain't got no feathers in my seat but thats your chicken in my coup
Yeah
