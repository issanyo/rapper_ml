[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
The epitome of greatness face it no one placin' close
Sweetness on the bitch, that Walter Payton flow
On track to be the best, what you pacing fo'?
Call plays, step back, pump fake and throw
Who dat? Drew Breezin' on the field?
The document is monumental shit, reel to reel
No huddle game plannin', my form outstanding
Most haters commentators call them Pat Buchanans
Doors still slamming on the Cadillac
Swinging lane to lane, gripping grain like a battle ax
Camera man. Capture the future like it's here for me
While these cheerleaders cheer for me

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
We too hard to be crushed
Too gone to be stuck
Too fly to be touched
Too much to be us
So we, just let em do they thing
Cause we something like the A-team
And I ain't talking about they team
I'm talking Super Bowl great team
Undefeated all season
Champion shit, no Wheaties
Greetings

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Greatest '72 Dolphins, 2010 Saints
We doing what they ain't
Say it ain't so
Double back, what you came for?
Tryna mingle? Matter fact where's your bankrolls?
Make them niggas pay like T.O
Mike Irvin with the lines, fuck niggas get your grind
Niggas know I get it in, Vince Lombardi
Award recipient, nigga Dza track flippa
That nigga like LT, run through competition, smell me?
Coming at you 3-D, betta' eat ya Wheaties
Brett Favre, I go hard, it's too easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Yea, John Taylor. Just as nice as Jerry Rice
Still dump Gatorade on the coach and rock this ring
For the "un" lets sing. Ya done ya thing
I seen it all from the bleachers, schoolin' them
Giving lesson plans to the teachers
All from behind the scenes
Pulling strings, out for one thing
Al Davis's just win babies, Lost Ark Raiders
At the airport early rocking the latest
From one of my two clothing lines, that's product placement
Ice cubes in my pocket 2 minute drive Elway style I got this

[Hook]
