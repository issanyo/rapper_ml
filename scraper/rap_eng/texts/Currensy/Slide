[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah
From Cali to New Orleans
And back

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
I'm a low rider mostly, I cruise, I hop
But I got a couple muscle cars tucked at the spot
Talkin' about Camaros, El Caminos, Monte Carlos
Homie, I got a few of those
Pie track, tire scratch, you smell the smoke
Smell like love to me though
Down south flow, I get love on the left coast
Dippin' with my loved ones in a rag boat
Smoked out, three wheels through the Home Depot
Then in flew right back to the N.O
In Canal Street with my people
They was out doin' donuts, like the shit was all legal
Burnin' rubber, going crazy at the second line
Remind me of that one time, I was in the Bay with a homie of mine
Camaros and Trans Ams dancin' in the sunshine
Sideshow, they was like swung what you brung
If your engine ain't right don't come
The homie laid 5 grand on the trunk
Like which one of you boys wanna run
The cars then lined up, they raced he won
Got back to the stunts like what

[Hook: Curren$y]
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot

[Verse 2: E-40]
From the scrimmage (?) collard greens spinach
Higher than the Big Dipper my nigga, skies the limit
Chameleon paint on my transportation I'm switching lanes
When the sun hit my automobile the colors change
Tremendous slack for a bitch
Detachable steering wheel with the kill switch
Born to ball, VS's
Furniture in my mouth like Paul Wall from Texas
After my multiplications I'm in the streets like bullet cases
But right now I'm off an edible, and my heart racing
Credible, reputable, I show love to my thugs
Tap in my people my ghetto pass ain't revoked
This my corner sign, a Glad bag and a scale
Penitentiary chances, 4 and a half by 12 foot cell
Got a (?) up in storage a Falcon and a Giselle
Hanging up out of the window curving donuts in Camaro
Nigas'll hop in they vintage, yellow white black and brown
In the Bay these nigas'll shut the Golden Gate Bridge down
Man these niggas goin' crazy especially in the town
To the side show make the car spin like a merry go round

[Hook: Curren$y]
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Dropped two hunnid on a brand new drop
I just threw my six four back in the shop
Started all over, now my shit gon' hop yea
Dolla need the IROC with the t-tops
Dolla need VVS stones in his watch
Dolla need a real one, but not a little girl
Asked her what her favorite position, cow girl
Let her ride it, ride, ride, ride it
Baby from the Bay, she be out here hot sided
Candy paint on it, got it lookin' like a 'Rari
Imma drop that ass on that bitch when I park it
Imma pull a hunnid piece on the next harvest
Diamonds on my Taylor Gang chain, they gon' sparkle
Diamonds on my 40 Day Date, they retarded
Shorty say Dolla $ign you my favorite artist

[Hook: Curren$y]
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
Come through, leave two, run what ya got
Smoke out your block, hang out the T-tops
The tires won't slide if the motor ain't hot
