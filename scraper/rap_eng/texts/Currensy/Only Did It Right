[Intro: T.Y.]
It's that mother fucking Jet Life
Have your mother fucking mind right
Look, look

[Verse 1: T.Y.]
These hoes know that I'm a boss huh
Them Jet Life boys don't even ask the cost huh
We do it low key but we still like to floss huh
And all that hating gon' get you fought huh
You realize it, money making is my thing
That's why I'm trynna get it popping in this rap game
Trust none other than the niggas I roll with
And a big circle is how you get stole quick
Me and Spitta riding round in some old shit
Hitting switches, steady dipping to some oldies shit
Few thangs that you niggas just won't get
We work hard so we deserve all of this shit
Niggas out here like they ain't got money to get
That only mean Imma get my Rollie bright as it get
And Imma show it, let you see it when it hit the light
I'm here to make sure that you remember me for life

[Chorus: T.Y.]
I only did it right
I only did it right
I only did it right
I only did it right
I only did it right

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Word to this jernt I rolled I'm cold
Brand new old clothes, styling on them hoes
Smiling when I drove by eyes looking closed
But they on the roll, focused on goals
Leprechaun green pot of Acapulco Gold
Encrypted drop zone, locations in morse code
Rhymes I wrote thats more dope to download
More shows to rock and parties thats on boats
Suckas at home they FaceTiming they hoes
They unavailable, getting naked for whoever on
Hoping to blow up like inflatables
I'm unfadeable, chilling
Digital cable magazine on the coffee table who you hating on
Fool
