[Verse 1]
Thousand dollar umbrellas in the dope jams my man
Coolest nigga on the off land my man
40 yard dash in soft sand my man
Laying up with either hand, ambidextrous
Signing when I get them checks, bitch
Collect whips, driveway sick
You should check it various carriages
I just added to the list my man
69 Camaro and a Nova that I had to get my man
Rap money extravagance vacuum-sealed packages
Madness, ocean growing lettuce and cabbages
Smoking weed with the baddest one of my good habits
Sprinkling game on these tracks a nigga so good
Added your hoes frozen looking at it
As I drove past with my man
I got that drive in my eyes they see the passion
They come to see me in their high ass fashion
Designer panties get sneered to the side when I'm smashing
I wore my flooded Cuban for a chain reaction my man
Bathing Ape sweats neck in pomegranate my man
Watching Knot's Landing haters can't stand it my man
They can't box me in because I'm outstanding my man

One of the highest and the flyest niggas on the planet [x5]
Jet life
