Yeah
Yeah
Jets nigga
Welcome to the Winner's Circle
Uh
Yeah
Jets nigga
Uh
Welcome to the Winner's Circle
Uh

Never has a nigga this hot
Been slept on for so long
I wonder if niggas would ever catch on
But they woke up finally
Hollywood acknowledged me
Like a classic James Bond
Played by Sean Connery
Uh
All over the place with it
International flower, all over the place Spitta
Smoke one for my homeboy Dippa
When you get out of jail I'll smoke the next one with ya
Taking over the world from my laptop
FS Jets drop downloadable crack rock
I got purple polo horses on my black socks
I got a pound of purple Urkle at my stash spot
Not for sale, this be the personal
FedEx at the door
Fresh Bapes from Tokyo
They ain't fucking with the planes and they know it so
The flow so cold the pro tools froze
Yeah

Right back
Welcome to the Winner's Circle
My name is still in the streets
And my name is still
My name
Yeah
