(Intro)
Mashin, smashin
Live ass niggas in traffic, lighting up
Gas is, classics, playa ass niggas in traffic, mashin
Live ass niggas in traffic, lighting up
Hittin classics, playa ass niggas in traffic, catch a nigga
Mashin to where the cash is, live ass niggas in traffic, yea bitch
Smashin, couple live ass niggas in

(Verse 1)
Uh
Swervin on purpose hella herb lit shit perfect
Chevy surfin, bout 12 over south side dippin in the line
Chicks hypnotized by my Dayton wires, as I slide
They say I got a one track mind
But I think about money and cars all the time
What I drive could win awards when it's showtime
When it's go time 13 inch Dayton's like I'm skating on dimes
In my own lane, doing my own thang, stacking my own change
Rolling my own joints and I smoke my own strain
This a different cup I don't drink what y'all drink
I'm just tryna fill up the bank and my gas tank
Never pay attention to what y'all think
I rather drop 300 on a Mulsanne
So I could drive to my nephew ball game

(Chorus) (X2)
Mashin, smashin
Playa ass nigga in traffic, rolling up
Not passing don't ask him
Playa ass nigga in traffic, lighting up
Mashing, smashin
Playa ass nigga in traffic on his way
To where the cash is, then we dashin
Playa ass nigga in traffic, yea
