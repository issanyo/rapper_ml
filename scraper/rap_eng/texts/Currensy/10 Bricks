[Verse 1: French Montana]

Homie, I just lost my only paper, back to square one
Feel like misery is my only neighbor
They say God protect us
I don't know why I feel safer with a burner
Getting high got me locked up in the prison
Smelling like last night
Why people sell their soul for the fast life?
Nobody loves it
And they tell us go fight for the flag, but don't fight for them colors
Watch some television, have you baptized and your brain washed
What to wear, where to live, what to do when a friend is a friend with a motive
Them broke plans'll have a nigga down, feeling hopeless
Hoping I can make mils before I lay on my back
On the block where a million niggas flipping packs
Grabbing my leg
Feel like crabs in the bucket, can't get ahead

[Hook: Big KRIT]

Cause either niggas waiting on ya
Or they hating on ya
Tell 'em I ain't falling off never
That chopper say that they don't want it
I put some money on it
I'm a be coldest motherfucker ever

Cause either you a made man
Or your game plan
Trying to make that kind of money that don't exchange hands
You the pimp type, or you ho'n out
Motherfuckers know exactly what I'm talking about

[Verse 2: Curren$y]

Too much going on to think about
Old school Camero like the new ones never dropped
Bitch waving while I'm swinging but I can't stop
Like that green
Bitch, we always got the green light, what you mean?
I go where I please
Ho like, "don't leave" but baby, I'm in the breeze
Money don't grow on them, but I for sure smoke on them
Cadillac with the Ritz with the true spokes on them
Slabs, whatever you want, we have
Slinging like the rock fired by David and Goliath
Word rhyming Heisman
Joe Namath with my fur coat, sidelining
I bought Rolex watches for all of my offensive linemen
Because it's time to make it happen
Audio dope boy magic
Burning through the plastic, touchdown passes
Flicking fleas off like ashes

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]

Riiiiight
Niggas acting funny on the daily, spare me
I be indifferent to most shit, sincerely
Not a fuck given in my body, sorry
Try to hit me with that old school game, Atari
Leave them like Lawry's, nigga, saucy as shit
You know the type, bad bite
But when they see you, straight hop on your dick
I'm like "are these niggas stupid or nah?"
Rhetorical questions as I puff on my 'gar
Ain't heard from my homie in weeks, he in the hole
When I get that unavailable call I already know
And as soon as a nigga press 5
He hit me with a "riiiiight"
I be hyped, daddy, keeping spirits alive
Said he heard me on the radio the whole building was live
He like "Nigga, I won't see daylight soon
But as long as you shining bro, I'll be cool."
