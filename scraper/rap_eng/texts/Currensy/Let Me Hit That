[Verse 1: August Alsina]
You're looking so good right now
And I would if I could, pull you right now
But I know that you're the type to make 'em crazy
Cause you've got all my homies tripping on you lately

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
Think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even tripping cause my homies hit first
Cause baby, when I hold you, I know we can make it work
So let me get your contact
And the place I can meet you at

[Hook: August Alsina]
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, cause I'm super fly
I need that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, so baby, let me hit that

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Now you look good enough to eat
And every time we kiss, it's Swisher Sweet
I feel a spark every time we meet
Yeah, you do things to me

[Pre-Hook: August Alsina]
Think you put something in the air
Your body's so amazing, and one could even say it's blazing
You're wrapped tight, oh, you've got it going on
Cause you keep your hair nice
Oh, and I ain't even tripping cause my homies hit first
Cause baby, when I hold you, I know we can make it work
So let me get your contact
And the place I can meet you at

[Hook: August Alsina]
Baby, let me hit that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, cause I'm super fly
I need that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, so baby, let me hit that

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
When I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is wash up
Make sure I'm presentable, before I lay one fingertip on you
Every day I'm in the whip with you, crack the windows
Let them look-at-whose come close, get a little whiff of you
My old thing and my newer Coupe, ain't nothing changed, addicted to that, lifted off that
Every time that I hear your name, I'm ready to let that paper flip
I never been labelled as a trick, but I'll pay for it if I want it
I'm always high, stuck in the moment, had a convo with one of my homies
Told me 'bout when y'all first met, how viciously you put it on him
I couldn't even get mad about it, I was glad one of my partners got it
Super loud but she's super soft, softer than a whisper
Ain't no gold digger, but I ain't never seen her 'round no broke niggas, come smoke with me

[Hook: August Alsina]
Super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, cause I'm super fly
I need that super loud
Super strong, super green, got me super gone
I'm on that super on, and I'm super high
Feel like Superman, so baby, let me hit that
