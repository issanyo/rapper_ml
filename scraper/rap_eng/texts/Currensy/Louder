Hook: Turn it up, turn it up Louder (Louder!)
Turn it up, turn it up Louder (Louder!)
Turn it up, turn it up Louder (Louder!)
Turn it up, Turn it up

[Verse 1: Mowse]

I'm an artist, the microphone is just an empty canvas
So I paint the perfect picture so niggas could understand it
I'm rapping till I vanish
I gotta reprimand
These fools producing music, used it, abused it, and took for granted
I can't stand it when they treat it like it's a trend
As a youngin' I was rockin' them stages since I was ten
Had an early fascination with puttin' paper to pen
Or pen to a piece of paper, which ever way that you phrase it
The hobby grew to a passion
Every time I leave it pulls me back just like a magnet
Negative and positives is coming with the attraction
One hand I embrace the passion, but a distraction
When I got priorities, and these beats get blasted
Easily get trapped in
Involuntarily rapping
Lost in a world of music, with the headphones on I'm back in
Or right at home
Spotlight the lights is on, writing songs
To enlighten, known for locking flows just like Rikers
Cuz' I like to zone
Lyrically kicking, and spitting these writtens on microphones
Recitin' poems
So sharp could slice the bone
So leave the mic alone
Ain't talkin' catching bodies, but killing beats is what I be on
What I condone
Got the headphones, I put the white ones on

[Verse 2: Mowse]

Yo make it louder just to drown out the madness I think I had it (Here we go)
Damn he, going off like Randy cause I'm a savage
Don't confuse me with these other new niggas I'm far from average
Killing records with no effort, my nigga just be embarrassed
Raise you out your seat, believe I reeks havoc
Whenever I'm on beats proceed to see magic
I'm a G at this
Ain't for the theatrics
Only time a nigga really feel "free" is when I'm rapping
Cause' my mind starts racing, then I bop my head and get the mumblin'
To the public I'm looking crazy, you know they judging him
You on the outside looking in
I'm writing bars without a pen
Look within
You'll see the creativity then make amends
Golden child that stood out and graduated from basic trends
Royalty is in me that would make a prince, take offense
Ladies gents
Proceed to your seats cause' this the main event
Dollars making sense, but currency is only paper thin
And I feel that, real rap is only 8 percent
That's me and my team when we make it in
Moral of the story lets embrace the end
Relax, one love bump the track, homie take it in, and
