[Intro: Curren$y]
All the way 1000. Even my runaround coupe caught
Yeah rabie, huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Park the Modena at the marina
Life
La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Diamond Rolexes 'cause life precious
Space age carbon fiber, lightweight metals
This edition that I'm drivin' in is somethin' special
This what keepin' it real could get you
Any women that you want might let you
At this level of success there's hella angels and devils
Lamborghini Diablo, wingspan, open doors, coke in her nose
She left the restroom hair in a mess, livin' kinda fast boo
But not too quick for me to move past you
Ignore the lower ranks, plus I'm watchful of the banks
Crunch numbers over brunch, make that work for 'em
Watch how quick we get it all done
We'll be stuntin' all summer
Corporate ladder, climbed every rung
Some of my homies started out as runners
But we was born hunters with a crazy hunger
Only fed by money, bring me more money
Roll a joint out of a onion
My Bentley outside runnin'
Pilin' bread in the safe like it's a oven
Bread in the safe like it's a oven
Got a closet full of Bathing Ape, Rolls by the dozen
Too much sauce stickin' to the money
Spend it up, we got some more comin'
Jet Life, s-s-surf hoe, smoke somethin'
To keep it a thousand with you, girl, my coupe cost four hunnid
And that's before I put the rims on it
Got the Wraith instead of the Ghost
I thought that bitch was haunted

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Yeah
Stop talking, knock the walls down
Started from the porch to in a Porsche now
Drake to the left, J-Lo two doors down
Drop head, snipe, then the ocean get 'em lotioned down
Niggas that rushed too likely in a coffin now
And all the robbers turned corporate now
Martin had a dream but he didn't tell you the nightmare
You fear life 'cause you thought life was fair
If it ain't rap, Birdman till I'm Rich Forever
Tryna to get my health n mills together
Never took her on a date
Only cooked it right in front her
Wasn't Benihanas, it was Subway
Busy like a one-way, closet like a runway
Penthouse Khalifa Tower tryna keep my high up
Ask Crack, who put the Bronx back?
Grindin' for all that, crib you need four maps

[Outro: French Montana]
I do it for Chinx, Coke Boy legend
