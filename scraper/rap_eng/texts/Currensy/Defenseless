[Intro]
For the homie I just seen
Just seen him for Thanksgiving

[Verse]
Tryna make a mil and not get killed
Cause your life only matters to your immediate family
Lil daddy this shit real they'll flip you
Looking through fear goggles
A successful scholar just a dangerous nigga
You get too close they squeeze the trigger, self defense ya
Take from the world something that was God given
And they keep doing it too
Got me nervous as fuck in the Coupe
Like I got 10 unwrapped birds in my Coupe
And I ain't riding with shit but a soda
Cop still drawing weapons on the pull over
Civilians playing sheriff too
Hunt ya down like it's the thing to do
I only said it cause it's true
Cause it's true

[Outro]
The vocal booth more potent than the voting booth
The vocal booth more potent than the voting booth
It's about the ruler keep your head up
The vocal booth more potent than the voting booth
Know you dealing with some real shit
Rest in peace to Joe McKnight
The vocal booth is more potent than the voting booth
Smoking one for his whole hood
Y'all stay up
