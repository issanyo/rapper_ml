[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
Skinny nigga toothpick
But I do lift weights like I'm using roids
Rolls Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
This is not for commercial usage
Please don’t categorize this as music
Please don’t compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers
I’m more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude
I ain't trying to diss
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
I’ma follow the rules no matter how much time I’ma get
I’ma live and die with the decisions that I’ma pick
So fuck the haven for caving, that’s why we don’t speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code, cracked the safe
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch

[Refrain: Jay-Z]
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Money to be made best believe a niggas glocking
I run it myself like a quarterback option
I pitch her 10 G's tell the bitch to go shopping
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back the chopper
See niggas tryna kick but no I don't play soccer
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of 1 ki I see 70 thousand dollars
Now I will shoot dice, smoking on a joint
I bet with your gawdy we hit 5 straight points
Yo we kept hustling, yo we kept grinding
You rap about money and a nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in your ass with your head right behind ya
Dope game bitch his momma woulda bought em
If you holla at me, a fee

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Bitches come a dime a dozen
I fuck em sisters, cousins
It’s a revolving door
Pussy going, pussy coming
And when they go to you it's coming back to me with money
I tell her put them shoes on and keep my paper running
I put my mack down just like a G supposed to
And if she don’t come home with it then she’s sleeping over
I got em creeping over, we do it then a soda
I like them Ameriie, you can have them Omarosas
Them niggas down below us, baby we up and over
I’m trying to get inside that thing that sits between your shoulders
I’m talking large totals
I’m talking large motors
I’m talking burning rubber then melted Pirelli odor
I’m hopping out a Lotus, you looking at my bitch
You wanna holla, you can holla take her on a trip
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back

[Refrain]
