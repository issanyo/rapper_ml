[Verse]
Yah
Imma start from the top
I move with a crew
With the coolest of dudes who after the guap
Smashing the block
Brand new shoes on
Brand new coupes and the roofs be dropped
Ain't gon' stop, ladies flock
Cause they recognize what's real
Wanna blow that killa and play video games up in my crib
Yah I live like a big old kid
Go skateboarding with my click
Seven chains around my neck
On my armor, necks, and wrists
Watch, sitting in my new Corvette
Listening to that Carter disc
Haters sending shots at me
But they must be blanks 'cause I'm not hit
Straight up thanks to God I give
He gave me the gift that made me rich
Can you see me in my whip
I bet you can I ain't got no tint
All that hating ain't making no sense
Say what you want but I ain't gon' quit
Only gon' make me more intense
Ain't never gon' stop, I'm making these chips
Only thing that make me pissed
Is some of my boys ain't living
Finally feeling success and they ain't here to enjoy it with me
Damn
But here I stand
In a pair of Marc Jacob vans
Riding luxury sedans
And hopping out with baggy pants
Coppers looking at me mad
Cause I'm young but I got more cash
Look at all this fun I have
All I do is smile and laugh
I know why you guys so drove
You must have seen what I drove
Lambourgini Diablo with SV badging on the door
Whoa
How fast do it go?
Honestly I do not know
Follow me, no you too slow
Eat some dust, I hope you choke
Should have been rich since double '02
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Gave my homeboy prison blues
Over shit that wasn't true
Home I've been paying dues
Now its time that I got paid
Shut your face and cut the check
Cut the check and shut your face
Bitches want to come and play
To them this is what I say:
Me and TK got the crib in the A
Baby girl you can come but you can't stay
Me and TK got a crib in the A
Baby girl you can come but you can't stay
Yah
Spitta
Yah
Fly nigga
