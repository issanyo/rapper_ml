[Verse]
When I park I cut my wheels so you can see my rims
Got the gold 24's on a Rolls for the win
Bitches trying to go where get in where you fit in
I'm not free 'til Janu-neverary, can you wait 'til then?
I got so much cash to get
Hustle on my to-do list
Its the only thing there is so mama there it is
We got orders to ship
We got products to mix
Cooking dope in here, we're rich cause the streets need a fix
Broke niggas ain't shit 'cept to a broke bitch
And a ho without no dough's a ho you won't see me with
Got the game from some pimps, but I stayed in my own lane
Though occasionally my Mac Daddy ways get me paid
All I need is dozier sticks and element lemonade
Smoking major as I sit in my hammock in the shade
Don't play with me
'Cause you'll get played
I'm the captian of this ship, ain't no ho getting saved
You just gon' drown waiting for me to reach out for you babe
Don't wait for me
Wait for your nigga
He the one gon' come in there and watch them movies with you
I'm the one gon' keep it moving right after I hit you
Use your decoration towels, wipe off them I'm splitting
Don't wait for me
Don't play with me
Don't hate on me
Make way for me
