La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

[Chorus]
Now the 100 dollar bills thick as a roll of tissue
Any kind of action is not a issue
Them niggas you've been movin' with is not official
Mommy you've been fuckin' lames, I could never hit you
I came through in foreign things when I came to get you
We got Porsches and McLarens, all that other shit too
Pourin' in from all the tourin', state to state with my crew
Stackin' up for rainy days and all the sunny ones too

[Verse]
Because I like to stunt on 'em baby, that's somethin' I do
I'm from New Orleans, I was born to maneuver them coupes
Imported on 22's, decent fit, coilovers, springs dropped a lil bit
It look like some movie shit
Yours truly in the booth, packagin' and wrappin' these bricks
My style capture a chick
She was dressed quite ravishin'
In the parkin' lot at the Radisson
With garbage bags of cash in the back of the van
Waitin' on my man, just as planned, tracking the second hand
I expected him any minute, he pulled up just now to get it
Meet me at the loft tomorrow mornin' after I done split it
With my niggas, I put aside a little bit that I'm gon' give you
And there's more where that done came from
Remember if you go where I send ya, make me a million
I keep you stuntin' on them lesser bitches
Most hoes get played, boss ladies get paid
I see something in ya, you on my radar, you a contender
See we could kick it about them digits, I could never hit you
Just fleek them lames out their things, momma bring me their loot
See what it do and I'ma come through
Them 100 dollar bills brand new and blue
Rollin' green, woke up in a dream

[Chorus]
Now the 100 dollar bills thick as a roll of tissue
Any kind of action is not a issue
Them niggas you've been movin' with is not official
Mommy you've been fuckin' lames, I could never hit you
I came through in foreign things when I came to get you
We got Porsches and McLarens, all that other shit too
Pourin' in from all the tourin', state to state with my crew
Stackin' up for rainy days and all the sunny ones too
