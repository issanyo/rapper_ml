[Hook: Miguel]
I wanna kiss your mind, babe
Let's take a walk on the clouds
Let me taste your thoughts, babe
Let's take a walk on the clouds

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Last night I fell asleep counting a million cash
Life wild, I only smile when I see my stash
Large yacht, fast money, she need a slow cruise
Cigar, Ciroc, her nigga old news
Old money always put me on my new shit
Hermes ahead on my to-do list
Rollin up loud, take a walk in the clouds
Take a look at my niggas, young, rich and we wild
Ain't no bitches allowed, acting like snitchin' in style
Got this gold on my neck, we teachin' new principles now
Startin' the Lotus, revvin' the motors
Walk on the clouds, we ain't second to no one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
I got you walkin' on cloud nine
Your shoe collection not as proud as mine
You only second to my first love, pie
But just refer to her as alpine
Alpina, the B7 on beach headin'
Like you riding on first class to reach heaven
Close enough to see the gates open
Waterfront, you gon' wonder if the lakes open
Balconies have you bend over
Chanel samples being sent over
Shit, I swear she was goin' for me
Right, just keep it tight and keep it warm for me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I could never go broke, what my name is?
I'm a brand, I'm a man who became rich
New car, new crib, but I ain't a switch
The same old niggas I been with
Got this loot together sayin' ones gon spend it
Circle of winners baby girl I done brung you in it
No iPhone pictures, you gotta live off memory
Pop the hood I show you the engine
Roll through my old hood, put you up on my history
Smoke joints with my niggas and cash stunts on them bum ass niggas
I don't deal with, we done caught fire
Let them suckas catch feelings but they can't reach us
We in the God ceilings, cathedral-style homes
Rosaries in my Rolls Royce, God put me on
Rollin' somethin' choice, lighten up raw cones
She never won' come down, I promise her she won't

[Hook]
