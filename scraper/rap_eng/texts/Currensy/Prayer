[Intro]
Hopefully, I don't die
Hopefully, I don't sink
Darkness is my only fit
'Less he kissing on my pink

Baptise my insides
Baptise my insides
Let all my sins be sanctified

Hopefully I don't die
Hopefully I don't die

[Verse 1: Mary Gold]
Thank God for them lords
That's Eastside, Westside
The haze we carry to strong to
Be rollin up on the inside
Take it up to the sanctuary
Bless it off 'fore we take part
He lick the blunt
Then he tastes my lips
We fucking for the hell of it

[Hook: Mary Gold]
Baby get down on your knees
Praise the Lord
For what you're about to receive
If I'm earth, you must be king
If you're God, then I'm Mary

[Verse 2: Mary Gold]
I live my life for the hell of it
Fucking bitches
Smoking killa
Riding around in something old school
With my niggas
Fuck the life you living
Young shell with a wise mind
I see past your lifetime
When the world end
I'll still be here
Breaking down this mary jane

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Hopefully I don't die
Mashing the gas in my Italian car
Red lines underneath the pink sky
Sunlight day come break the night apart
Baby pledge that she trying to ride
Said she'll drag the slab if the wheels fall off
Lying low, but a nigga high
The road weigh hard
But the leather weigh soft
She kinda boss
And you kinda lost
Need school and game
Imma provide for her
Niggas'll spend top dollar
To stand right beside her
Their weakness is
They gonna confide in her
See she can beat you niggas without violence
She'll shoot a nigga dead without firing
Driveby without driving
Drove the last sucka nigga out his mind mane

[Hook]
