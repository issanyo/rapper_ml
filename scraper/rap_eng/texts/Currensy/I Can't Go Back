[Intro: Curren$y]
Goddamn right
Man this good here
You think it's happening right now?
You think it's happening right now?
I'm wondering if we should even smoke this one
Cause I don't think my dawg can handle it
I might just have to keep this mothafucka myself

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Slid through like bacon grease on my shoes
Coupe brand new
Old hoe sit chickenhead, bitch caught the bird flu
Holiday wreath on my New Year's Wraith
Niggas can't take, so they hate
My dogs say
One of them pussy ass niggas might reach one day
So he wait, in case he gotta blow one of them niggas away
Damn, I'm just tryna stack my cake, man
Why don't you do the same?
Talkin' down on the ones comin' up, oh that's so lame
You should be ashamed, I'm sayin'
Get up, get out, get it
Don't be mad when you see me with it
Ask me how I did it, I'm a real nigga, chop game with you
All about them digital digits
More cash than we could ever stash
Burn it all down like some OG hash, yeah

[Hook: Curren$y]
Plottin' on another one
Still countin' up from the last heist
Rainy day for sure to come
When it do I bet I have my fuckin' money right
Plottin' on another one
Still countin' up from the last heist
Rainy day for sure to come
When it do I bet I have my fuckin' money right

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I bet I get my money right, wrongdoin' every night
Walkin' through that dark tunnel, it's my time to see the light
And I don't follow protocol, I don't be actin' like I might
Wipe tears from my girl's eyes for the last time
Baby I'm about to blow up like a landmine
They was hidin' the plug from me, now we got the same lines
Smokin' binds from the hills of California
Nothin' like that garbage niggas sell on every corner that you buy from
When I finish stuntin' it's your turn
It's about how much you earn
That should be your number one concern, woadie
And there really ain't no guidelines
You should be writin' your own book
Like me cause I don't rock with these youngsters
I got my own look
Opinions' just like assholes: everybody got 'em
And I hate when niggas make their problems everybody's problems
Nigga tellin' me like I'ma really care about his problems
All I care about is how big is my share for tomorrow

[Hook: Curren$y]
Plottin' on another one
Still countin' up from the last heist
Rainy day for sure to come
When it do I bet I have my fuckin' money right
Plottin' on another one
Still countin' up from the last heist
Rainy day for sure to come
When it do I bet I have my fuckin' money right
