I'm feelin it, fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it, feel the Lex' pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it, feel the high that you get from the la
Feelin it if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I keep it realer then most, and niggas feelin this
Streets talkin in the N.O., and I'm hearin this
Spitta got a hell of a flow, I been sayin this
The car right next to you probably playin this
I love my city, I will always stay in it
It's so true..
Hurricane came through, but I did not move
Anybody know me will tell you that I'm a cool dude
Half time you won't even know I'm in the room
But every now in then I get bent and act a fool
Hit my backyard and show my girl how to shoot the tool
Might watch ray ray skate the pool
If I can get a flight to LA this afternoon
If not I'm at humidity boardshop
Chillin with my homeboy Philly
A lil boutique shop in that traffic
And blow 6 grand on Crooks & Castles
Fuck it I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Respect the way I took a pause before I spit the rap
This beat is classic so I feel like it deserve that
People who live above the clouds love the way I rap
Life at 30, 000 feet was full of old tracks
Back from when music was music, newer shit is wack
Don't trip real niggas I'm bringin it back
Can't call it gangsta, can't call it back pack
But I bet ya (I'm feelin it)
To all my girls who clean my house and organize my kicks
Good lookin out, you got my crib all nice and shit
While I'm listenin to beats just writin shit
Hittin niggas in the head with the flyest shit
Airplanes in the house girls like my shit
I'm the type to meet a model, one night that bitch
One time no comin back twice and shit
Unless I'm feelin it..
