[Curren$y]
Weed and instrumentals
Combination couldn't be more simple
Pulled up with that flip flop
Candy paint drip drop like soda pop
For a thirsty bitch
Crew tight suckas can't fit
Hella whips cruise like Taylor Swift
Make that chevy sit nice, man
Heavy in yo click like
No movers, no shakers, No risk takers
Scared baby's run and hide cuz there's real life monsters outside
Niggas collectin dolla signs for your homicide, that's why
I'm in the studio most of the time getting high
Pinning the soundtrack to your movie as we ride
The number twenty (?) on the side
My Jordan number 5's
The year 2000 and first runnin them (?)
Flyin I don't even try, Oh my
Dawn in my car before I even put it in drive
Completely out of my mind
Yet at the same time intelligent
Refined and 100% all about mine

HOOK [Curren$y]
Ya... Weed and Instrumentals
Let my nigga T.Y get with you

[T.Y.]
Now one thing that I know is that these niggas can't fade us
That playa shit we made of
Get fucked up with my niggas and thats on a daily basis
We blow it by the eighth
Just do us a favor and keep your distance
If you know like we know then you wouldn't listen
Gotta a lotta mothafuckas wanna be in my position
But captain won't let you fly round here pimpin
Always reppin the set thats wherever Im at
In the 65 with my nigga gettin bent R.I.P
Straight niggas hate it when you get rich, well hate this
Crazy insane bitches actin mad trynna get hit
Hitting corners all day same time hitting licks
You're not my partner cuz you dapped me and my niggas man
When I be done with a bitch she become my biggest fan
Im hot right now I need to fight the biggest fan
Jet life really about big business man

Getchya mothafuckin mind right!
