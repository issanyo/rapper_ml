[Intro]
Yeah
Jets nigga where haven't we been yet
Could turn me up a lil bit though
Fuck boys is wonderin' if they bitch next

[Verse 1]
Everybody like "He's no item, please don't like him"
But the chance to sip cham with champs is enticing
Tried to fight the fever she followed them flashing lights man
And it's leading her directly to where I am
I stand G'd up as always
You can't knock it
Three cheers for spitta cause he always on his fly shit
I caught her eyes with sure hands like the legendary Jerry Rice
I give it to her right have her dreamin of weddin rice
She never smoke so much weed in her life
She high, I'm high
Too stuck to wake up
Remote control, shut the blinds
I wouldn't mind if we fuck a dozen mo times
Before you dip cuz you gotta get back to your man
Don't ask when you can see me again
I ain't good at making plans
Cooler than a ceiling fan
Spendin winter time at iceland, I am

[Hook]
When I get too high on my plane
Will I remember how dope it was last time you came
When I get too high on my plane
And if I ever touch down in your city we could do it again

[Verse 2]
A rolling stone gathers no moss
I'm stoned
Rolling joints, flipping hoes like a coin toss
Niggas don't trust spitta cause he knock they hoes off
Homie I don't fuck witcha then theres no holds barred
Brung her to the club with you fool
Thats yo fault
She chose to move with a boss
Thats yo loss
Bitch niggas hatin on the jets so they throw salt
Mama lovin on the jets wanna take her clothes off
Homie in the car all alone as he drove off
He gone cry in the car
Won't see his girl till tomorrow
She at my crib in a bra
Dancing on top of the bar
Don't trip just friends we are
Shorty I'm goin far
And you see me smart enough to know
That I'm finna blow
Like a lit firecracker or some armed C4
Goin places and seein things
Fuckin hella bad bitches and not attachin any strings

[Hook]
When I get too high on my plane
Will I remember how get the plugs last time you came
When I get too high on my plane
And if I ever touch down in your city we could do it again
