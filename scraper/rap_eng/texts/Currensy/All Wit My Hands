[Intro]
Porsches, Lambs, all with my hands
Mansions expand, haters don't understand
All the work I been putting in
Now it's raining bricks

[Verse 1]
Nigga please, I'm a G, you a sucka
Baby look at me and tell me what you in this truck for
$pitta brings Chevys out all summer
Winter I'm a slam in the H1 Hummer
95 Air Max, dope runners
Shows every night, hella racks, doing numbers
Homie asks where y'all was at when it was struggling
You was playing the back, you was hiding from it
You ain't want nothing, now you got nothing
While I'm smoking on an onion, counting something
Out yacht shopping, boat hunting, car lot copping
Call me if you want something

[Hook]
Porsches, Lambs, all with my hands
Mansions expand, haters don't understand
You ain't notice all the work I was putting in
Underground in the kitchen, now it's raining bricks

[Verse 2]
Hoe what? I'm out your league
Smoking dolo, don't come talking to me
Focused on money, baby I can't see
No future in we, mama we can't be
Pledge allegiance to God and green
THC in the oxygen that I breathe
New Year's Eve is choppers by the trees
Bring it in safe, please you know how it be
Realer than TV, listen to OG's
Stack dope before me then passed down rollies
To new breeds, this tradition
What have you been in?
Motherfucker you don't know me, you kiddin'

[Hook]
Porsches, Lambs, all with my hands
Mansions expand, haters don't understand
You ain't notice all the work I was putting in
Underground in the kitchen, now it's raining bricks
