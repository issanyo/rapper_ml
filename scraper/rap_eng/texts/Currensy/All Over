[Intro: Curren$y]
Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet
Jet Set, where haven't we been yet

[Hook]
Getting money all over the world, all over the world
(Toronto and Amsterdam, Brazil,Paris, France and Japan
Anything for the grands, yea)
Getting money all over the world, all over the world
(Germany to Italy, North South Pole, anywhere in between, anything for the green)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Spitta, spend yen on bape
Red carpet, yo bitch my date
She throwin' the Jets in every pic we take
I upload em with a song on Nah Right today
Those niggas is not like the planes
Them hoes don't digg em, they tryna' get on my team
And how can you blame, she know self preservation
The first rule, she know she'd die of boredom if she with you
While I'm sitting poolside looking real cool
With a Grape flavored 50 cent juice
Paid for one, the corner store lady gimme two
Nigga thats love, thats what I live on
Right before take off, twitter from the cell phone
Another show rock, more money got word to Chris and Neef
Can't stop won't stop, yea

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
C'mon, I go straight where the cash is
Heard about your last date being tragic
I know, my last tape was a classic
So all I hear now is paper or plastic?
Few Rosays, now you drunk saying boy
"why you in my face and you only want one thing?"
You wasting your time fucking lames
Only 2 things poppin, thats Jet Set and The Gang
Eating sushi, few groupies, new clothes and left over room keys
I want my good girl to smoke weed and love playing Nintendo Wii
And I got pictures in my cell phone, iChat
When I'm gone, land somewhere calling home
Put me right up where the best at
Nigga we Jet Set, so where haven't we been yet?
Yes

[Hook]
