[Intro]

Yeah
These Fast Times at Ridgemont Fly [3x]
Jets, uh

[Verse 1: Curren$y]

What you want to do?
Y'all want to be ballers, shot callers, brawlers
Who be dipping in the Benz with the spoilers
This beat cool but let's skip to the good part
I'm that nigga
Been had lyrics since tapes
And the rise of the plane continues
It's Mr. Clean Kicks speaking
More dunks than the contest at NBA All-Star Weekend
Jodeci flow, I got the girl feenin'
Your ho keep my name in her mouth more than my semen
See man, you a little jackass like Wee Man
Louis Vuitton E-L-A-N high tops
High as hell
At a very posh Hollywood night spot
Celebrity bitches [?] in the club
They fight amongst the stars like Sky Fox
Cocky I'm not
But I do look down at you players in the game
Like I'm sitting in a sky box
I stop never
You rappers got a month to get your shit together
Yeah
