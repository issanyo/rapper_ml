(Jay Z Lucifer Sample)
Jets nigga, where haven't we... uhh
Bitches know the Planes got it

F-I-N dot dot dot

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Thats Spitta Ain't it?
That nigga internet famous
Fresh while its painted
Pass the joint to the cat he came with
Speaking the codes
Landlovers dont know the pilot language
Everytime we hear you niggas bite our style we change it
Everytime you try to holla at a dime
She say she taken
And if you do get a bad one and bring her round us she's taken
These rappers is acting gay
6 degrees of seperation
I swear them niggas kicks like my Nike Air Bakins
Im at the hobby shop
Im in the R-I-C racing
Smashed my gas-powered viper and now i need a replacement
I got that to plu on pluto
That space shit
They must of told you not to say the "S" word in your raps cause we heard your joints you ain't say shit
Clear the lane
Make way for the planes bitch
You think she a model but to us she just a plain bitch
Your girlfriend will forever be The Planes bitch

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Fly Society
Now its major league cash so them niggas call us bankers
Big bob marley blunts
We call them stankers
Hold the hood down so them niggas call us anchors
And ain't shit change
The judge still get the finger
Call up Mr. Robinson
They never see my angle
Out in Cincinnati like I'm betting on the Bengals
Look how i stack my chips up like Pringles
And they say i ask to ass i mean anal
And i bet i get paid far as the game go
Stack them all up until the singles
Back when they bumped Cutless Mindless and regals
My hoopgroup you gon hold like tivo
And jets fly the globe like beatles
Sharper than a razor
On point like needles
That word to my main mamacita
They used to laugh at me
Now im bumping through their speakers
Like "Hell yeah, feel getting that money legal"
