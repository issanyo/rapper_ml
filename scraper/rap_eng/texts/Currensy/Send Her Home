[Verse 1: G Perico]
My nigga, had to let you know that your bitch trippin'
You told me if the bitch want it, I can go and hit it
Hold up, I know you love her and you live with her
Plus you my nigga, so it really ain't that serious
She be all in my mentions, DM-ing
Naked pictures, smiley faces, and kisses
Seen you go upside her head just for looking too long
Fightin' niggas in the street that she used to fuck on
She got a piece of your love, don't lie
Playin' Teddy Riley and Guy
The next time I see the bitch, she probably have a black eye
Sayin' why you have to let him know?
I stick to the code, baby, it's bros over hoes
Don't want to have another close nigga tryna kill me
'Cause he all in his feelings, actin' like he ain't in love with these bitches
This all happened before like deja vu
I fucked a bitch and her nigga acted like it was cool

[Chorus: G Perico]
When your girlfriend call to come and kick it (hey)
You know a nigga with it
When you callin' her phone trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin')
I'll send her home to you nigga
When your girlfriend call to come and kick it (hey)
You know a nigga with it
When you callin' her phone trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin')
I'll send her home to you nigga

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Money on my mind
Never met a bitch worth the time
From a nickel to a dime
It's nothing to a nigga on the million dollar grind
Higher than the skyline
These simp ass niggas can't keep it player
Turning into killers over bitches
Speakin' that game from experience
This one nigga used to be my dog
'Til I pulled him to the side, tried to tell him 'bout his broad
How could you want shoot when I'm tellin' you the truth
The fuck wrong with you?
Player facts, everybody wasn't raised like that
These niggas havin' nightmares, picturin' these bitches in my Cadillac
Instead of thinkin' 'bout scratchin', don't trip, homie
I'ma send her back with a note attached
Jet Lyfe, So Way Out, you can trust that, L

[Chorus: G Perico]
When your girlfriend call to come and kick it (hey)
You know a nigga with it
When you callin' her phone trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin')
I'll send her home to you nigga
When your girlfriend call to come and kick it (hey)
You know a nigga with it
When you callin' her phone trippin'
(Trippin', trippin', trippin')
I'll send her home to you nigga
