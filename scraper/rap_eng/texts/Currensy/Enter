[Verse]
Uh
Money I got, still tryna get more
Grind don't stop, still thinking like a nigga broke
Smoked one with Juvenile, sticking to the G code
Cutting through the rain clouds, Gulf stream sipping Moe'
With a little OJ Lemonade Mimosa
You don't say can't tell if this work or vacate
But I stay focused on the dope
Cause it's the only way
Doors open vertically if you got enough cake
Women throw their morals away
She gon' be a hoe today
Do what ever I say cause she seen me hoppin out that Wraith
Game cold but it's fair
I got a mink coat for this affair
Legendary shit, they felt it in the air
Them bitches knew I was there, these moments so rare
Take a picture baby girl, don't stare
Cherish this moment that we both being real playing in motion
It's always going for it never on no "oh shit!"
Three wheel Lexus, they can't find no time for it
My time is money, son who paying for this ?
