[Intro - Estelle]
I keep on comin’ back oh back to you
Baby uh
I keep on comin’ back

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
From day one they down to ride
Every second since then, they’re by my side
Broken hearted from the lies, often she cried
But holdin’ on to love for dear life
Before everything was good, we had a greater time
But fall out over something, a few months down the line
See clearly love is blind cuz we can’t see a way out this
Nor reach a compromise, honestly I’m not tryin’
Cuz I wanna be with you but they callin’ me outside
And I’m like How can a man choose? I wish you’d understand
That them others ones ain't you, I really just be playin’
Might smash up and be through, but my heart’s still in your hand
And I promise that’s the truth and I hear what you be sayin’
And I feel your point of view
But somewhere I forget that shit, get caught up in the loot
Late night speedin’ them coupes
I respect it if you left me but I’m glad you never do

[Hook - Estelle]
See here’s the thing
I won’t sit here broken hearted
Boy, we gon get back where we started
‘Cause I won’t need you, no
I gained too much to lose

I’ve already bothered you
And there’s nothing left but just us two
You’re everything (You’re everything)
See that’s the thing (See that’s the thing)
Yea, that’s the thing

[Verse 2 - Curren$y]
And I don't fall asleep next to none of them hoes
No matter what’s poppin’ I be sure to make it home
There’s no excuse for wilin’, I’m just makin’ sure it’s known
But I’m actually not doin’ half of what I could be doin’
I’m slowin’ down, tryna make improvements
Thinkin’ ‘bout the future and shit that one cohesive unit
Raise a little princess, a junior
Soon as I make enough with this music
This dream got my attention love be patient as I pursue it
It'll benefit the both us if you’d just sit through it
When it’s all said and done we would have built a thing of beauty
And sail into the setting sun, but I already know
That you done heard this like a thousand times before
And I done said it like million times more
But I’ve been sincere, I see us winnin’ and we almost there

[Hook - Estelle]
See here’s the thing
I won’t sit here broken hearted
Boy, we gon get back where we started
‘Cause I won’t need you, no
I gained too much to lose

I’ve already bothered you
And there’s nothing left but just us two
You’re everything (You’re everything)
See that’s the thing (See that’s the thing)
Yea, that’s the thing

(bridge)
You wanna go with me and we connect
Now we’re supposed to be
I’m all yours, all yours, all day
And I could fix
I’m gonna walk you out
Cuz I proved out
So I tough it out
So I’m all yours, all yours, all day

[Hook - Estelle]
See here’s the thing
I won’t sit here broken hearted
Boy, we gon get back where we started
‘Cause I won’t need you, no
I gained too much to lose

I’ve already bothered you
And there’s nothing left but just us two
You’re everything (You’re everything)
See that’s the thing (See that’s the thing)
Yea, that’s the thing

I said I love you
That’s the thing
I won’t allow you
See that’s the thing
You know I love you
See that’s the thing
