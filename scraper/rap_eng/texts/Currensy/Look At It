[Intro]
Yeah, fool
Ladadada
Uh, yeah
Fool

[Verse]
Finna change the world like color TV
Studio with two O's and a girlfriend with me, bitch look at it
Here in the booth, my joint straight OG
That's all I smoke bitch, and you know this if you really know me
I'm rollin' back home in a 6-4 on chrome D's, bitch look at it
Made it rich from just keepin' it G, never switch
Doing things that wasn't me, an image that I couldn't see
One that I couldn't be, represented heavily
My city and my set until the death of me, bitch look at it
Slid through, drive by killed you
Flying Spur, three-piece stainless the shoes
Old niggas gettin' sick cause the dog gettin' rich
All night, wrappin' bricks, make a wish
Homie on the mix, get it right before we shift, bitch look at it
Put it on the street, watch 'em flip, it's a trip
Life's sweet but she's also a bitch
Get her high, fuck her good while I got the time
You know I stay 747 fly high
24/7, 365, no lie, like bitch look at it
Mainstream money, underground hustle got me jumpin' into larger tax brackets
Like bitch look at it
No tint on my Benz like bitch look at it
Via satellite from my palace, bitch look at it
You know what's happenin', made it rich from rap trappin', ha
