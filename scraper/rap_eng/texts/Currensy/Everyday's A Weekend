[Intro]
Yeeaah, roll one - light one
We gon' take it to the cloudz
Believe that!

[Verse 1]
I hopped in the four door and mashed out
Like I hit the fucking lotto and cashed out
Last night I smoked white kush, passed out
Why nobody ain’t telling me, damn
It's a new day I'm feelin good like raw sex
Forever hood fuck the law, yes
Got a bad bitch naked in my fortress
Keep your enemies close what you call chess
I'm playing it ain’t hard to tell like L
I am doing doing and doing it well
Ask Khaled - all I do is win
Then I gets money tell a friend tell a friend
Fly bitches, fast cars and fresh fabrics
At the clearport with black cars no baggage
My life is so movie like
Self Made nigga, New York to LA, nigga
Game time, watch how they tailgate, nigga
I am the fuckin' main event from a milk crate, nigga
Flow sharper than Steve Harvey hairline
Homie, I'm flyier than a united airline

[Hook]
Welcome to my world
Where every day is a weekend
Believe that
And we’ll be smoking
Cause every day is a weekend
Believe that
And shorty want a ride
She said she wanna be next to me
I am so hood, I am the realest
Getting money be my specialty
It's moving!

[Verse 2 by Curren$y]
Ashes on my sweatpants, still smokin'
Bitch think she slick, fishing for my password
Left my laptop open
Funny games ran by lames, I'm in my [?] sellin'
Taking pictures of my favorite strains
Puffin by [?] mocks out my style
Bitin' ass niggas switch my flows up You still nibblin'
On that speaker, [?] season flows, You can have those
Like my video shoot close
Post up, rose a couple prerose
Doctor Queen, [?] incredible sin
Jet Life, we're in heaven
I been hooded in air whe'r' I been

[Hook]
Welcome to my world
Where every day is a weekend
Believe that
And we’ll be smoking
Cause every day is a weekend
Believe that
And shorty want a ride
She said she wanna be next to me
I am so hood, I am the realest
Getting money be my specialty
It's moving!

[Verse 3]
