[Intro]
I said fool, I drop them bomb-ass tapes

[Hook: Dee Low]
To all my people on the right, you gotta get it ya self
To all my people on the left, go and get it ya self
To all my people in the middle, go and get it ya self
Man, you better get you cause everybody for self (for self)

[Verse 1]
Spitta, nigga, I do the music if you didn't know
Live from New Orleans, I host a show on [?]
Niggas just waking up, they never heard of him before
Good morning, here's a mixtape and an espresso
Hey ho, let's go, I listen to the Ramones all the way home
Flowmasters on the [?] performance cones
Let you know who riding up the block, Curren$y currently
Got the stock rising, niggas cannot front on he, he got G's behind him
Let my girl drive, I'm passenger side reclining
So low, top's off, I thought she was driving solo
While I'm smoking a doobie, I swear my life is a movie
I swear my life is my music, I swear my life is a movement

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I get it in like clowns in a Volkswagen
Paint it funny with the tailpipe dragging
Niggas asking mad questions "Spitta, what happen?
We thought you had an album coming after Where Da Cash At?"
I was laid back planning on receiving ass cap
Counted on before they heads, I fucked around and let 'em crack
Had to get another batch, way more careful
This time I'm gonna stash 'em, instead of carrying 'em
Looking for Spitta, I'm out in Cali with the [?]
Tally up the price, I'll have two of everything that's nice
Gotta the cool Corvette Z06 Arctic White, got the laces
On my shoes tied tight, alright like the hand that I wrote this with

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And so uh, and so I go, the flow so dope, I got 'em hooked
Like I cast fishing line from a boat, live as kings dead long time ago
When the cribs was castles and they had drawbridges and moats
The people rode horses, I rode horses
600 of 'em in the back of this Porsche
Miss, didn't miss a beat, never met a beat that I couldn't beat
Never met a freak that I couldn't skeet, I'm a capital G, I did it all for me
Real niggas and bitches applaud, I work, I go hard, I put all my shows off

[Hook]
