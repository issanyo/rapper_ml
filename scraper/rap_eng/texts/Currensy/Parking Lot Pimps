[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Sunday night ridin', got my bitch drivin'
I'm passenger side in somethin' look like it's flying
Audio dope on the stove like a fryin' pan
I can get you more, what you want long as you buyin' it
Haters they be eyeing them, we don't pay no mind to them
Designer send me looks, you gon have to stand in line for this
You off in the club ballin' out while I'm outside of it
Three wheel motion sun roof open with my partner and them
When your girl saw me slide she died to get in
And live that Jet Life momma told you kill yaself kid
I lit the doobie then I slid with her
Baddest bitch in the party I didn't have to go in to get her

[Hook x4]
Parking lot, parking lot, parking lot pimp

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
And I stay lifted off that dojah, in my 4 do' rollin'
Outchea tryna get it bitch I'm tryna make a fortune
Headed for that money bitch stop askin' where I'm goin'
Cause you ain't got no business, being up in my business
First car was a wide body was too small to get in it
First bitch was a bad bitch tried to share that ho with my nigga
I got his girl buyin' J's for me nigga real talk I'm pimpin'
I do this shit for my niggas bitch I do this shit for my niggas
Long night with that trap life shit I might as well smoke something
Was way too young to even hit the club shit I might as well post up
Lil nigga big business make her exit out 'fore she entered
I'm leanin' on my whip hun her friend tryna get in it
Work
