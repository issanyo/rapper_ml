[Hook: Curren$y]
Every day get paid, straight hustle(hanh)
Club full of bad bitches want all of 'em
Never know holmes, might hit the triple double
Triple double, triple double, triple double
Never know holmes, might hit the triple double
Trunk hard, top drop top, all on em(hanh)
Never know holmes, might hit the triple double

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Highed up thinking' 'bout the best move next(hanh)
Like fuck Jet Blue, I need a blue jet
Never underestimate the underdog greed
Best thing came up out the Northeast
Came up, what a hell of a man
.44, long nose, call me elephant man
Drag the nigga from the bottom of the bottom homie I could tell(hanh)
From crabs in the bucket to the lobster tail
Back in my living room shack, work flipped in the back
Nigga trippin' the set, I got a lick here(hanh)
Now a nigga show is 'bout a brick here(hanh)
Fuck a good day, this a good year(hanh)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Today was a good day, great day, yeah it was a payday
So make way for motherfuckers only 'bout that Grade A
Making money now, what the fuck you talking 'bout?
When these bitches start trippin' we just lock 'em out
Gotta bounce, and that's a regular day
For that independent rap shit I'm paving the way
They hatin' the way that I'm bathing in ape
Plus I'm comin' for your neck better make your escape
I came in shittin', wood grain grippin'
Bitches on that Cobain, cocaine sniffin'
But they just on a quest to be some rock stars
We party hard and we duckin' from them cop cars
It's Mac Miller, Montana
Smokin' blunts, bad bitches on camera
Took a second and got tatted on my neck and hands
You don't gotta love the music, but respect the man

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Get me on the court and I'm
Trouble in the exotic sports car no top
Somethin' gorgeous inside it askin' if she can drive it
They don't make these for novice, they make these for pilots
On wheels, 3-piece stainless steel
Haters tryna throw mud, it's love, I came out standing still
What's really real when these bitches behavin'
Like nymphos all sex crazy
Her home girl Molly came and got it poppin'
I'm just watchin' pullin' the lighter from my back pocket
Like that high karate
She won't kick it, sit by me
Come over to the crib, get hit by me
Woke up and told her get that money
Tell them lames you were sent by me
It's Jet Life over here partner
And plus nobody I know got popped in
New Orleans where I be
Smokin' pot with your hoes
Avoiding pot holes on these streets
Andretti!
