[Intro]
What you need to do nigga is go get me my chips, with dip. Cause you delinquent, motherfucker. Tryin' to knock my hustle nigga...

[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
I saw a nigga get clapped up, ridin' round in a drop top
I don't want that, and I ain't worryin' about nothin'
Yeah I spunt my money but I got that right back
Bitch all in my grill, she all in my mix
Good lord, tell her fall back
How I smash every beat, how I smash every beat like a nigga got a ball bat
And these crazy ass hoes, these crazy ass hoes swear to God that they all that
I ain't had no kicks, good thing Mal wear the same size let me hold that
And I ain't even trying to fuck
Like Slim say bitch that kitty cat throw back
I'm talkin' bout way back when I wore Reeves, Bose and my wave cap
And my little cus graduated from high school I'm proud of my nigga
And I made all star then we made it out when them cowards doubted us, nigga
Got 2 kids and her baby daddy ain't shit, she tired of that nigga
So she got a taste of that real, a taste of that real and fired that nigga
Ain't nobody gonna pay you like you gonna pay yourself no lie my nigga
If you can't get paid on the herb today then you bound to drown, my nigga
Tired as hell tryna make it out but don't quit, keep tryin' my nigga
Trap it up with my homie Smizzy like keep grindin' my nigga

[Hook: Young Roddy]
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
I gotta get it while the gettin' good, my nigga

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Tires fly when I mash the gas
The motor hot and these hoes fast
Choose the winner, lotto ticket
Boss figure, paid nigga
Broke is the new dead
If I said it I meant it
You should peep how I play it
Got game from cold blooded killas
Applied that to this, these raps is the bricks
The feds is still the feds though, always in the mix
And I heard the fight was fixed so we bet heavy at the event
And I cashed in major, light blazer, word to Craig Sager
Straight player, rhyme sayer, bitch slayer
Chevrolet frame layer, and we pullin' off capers for the paper
Like we pullin' car covers off the scraper
Cause the summer sun called me and it's beggin' for Daytons
When the seasons change we need newer things
That's why we always movin' mane
When the seasons change we need newer things
My moms on the Benz lot, pickin' somethin new out
I gotta get it

[Hook]
