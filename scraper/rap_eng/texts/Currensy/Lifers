[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Rolling in the city where I'm from
Bitches love money, niggas love guns
Swear to god nothing doing down the sun
Suckers playing in the do and it's already been done
I got a El Camino and the bitch run
Got it painted polo green
Got a Hilfiger windbreaker on
Smelling like Versace and weed, bitch please
Imma ride on these niggas til they gone
Cause I never let a sucker nigga breathe
Cause they twisting up the game on roam
And this exactly what the set don't need
Now check it, four lowriders front your house
The engines is running but lights it out
You already know what thats about
Got one foot in and one foot out

[Hook: Curren$y]
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Blue '65 on a set of gold D's
Nothing but the motherfucking lifer in me
High as a motherfucker, still rolling weed
Ain't nothing but the motherfucking la, la, la

[Verse 2: Le$]
I'm worried bout the paper, fuck some hip hop
Jumping out the slab in some flip flops
Ain't too many build the way we put together
Frame solid, paint way wetter
I'm thinking bout the days I used to need ride home
Now the passenger a ten and she bopping off chrome
Living off some nigga playing ball in the league
She gon' give me what I want and gon' leave without a knee
I'm running the streets like 20 on the Lions
Get my stats right and I think about retiring
The way I play the game bet I see the Hall of Fame
Defenders can't see em only know his last name
From the back of my jersey, I blew pass
All that trash I'll be hyping, fuck fashion
Need to focus on your writing
You clashing with the titans, play it wise lil nigga
You see you ain't ready in your eyes lil nigga

[Hook: Le$]
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Nothing but the lifer
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Nothing but the lifer
In a pearl cadillac and the vogues stay clean
Nothing but the motherfucking lifer in me
Coming down slow, mix the sprite with the lean
Ain't nothing but the motherfucking

[Verse 3: Young Roddy]
Iceberg Slim, pulling bitches on 'em
Still cruise the city with my blinky on me
On a money train, I'm on a mission homie
Had a half a ounce and a half a ticket on me
I miss curfew, my momma started bitching at me
Living in a hood where they was trigger happy
Riding in a classic bumping the classics
Fuck a bitch, I rather keep money under my mattress
Plan it out, draw it up and make it happen
This young boy genius with his mathematics
Saw my uncle in a Regal smoking on reefer
Saw a bad ass bitch in some white Adidas
Stack bread, still ain't nothing different homie
This rap niggas divas, need i mention homie
Let that bullshit in the past, I'm on some major shit
My niggas in the pen call it checking in

[Hook: Young Roddy]
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Nothing but the lifer
Ain't nothing but the lifer
Nothing but the lifer
Lil nigga, in wide body shit sitting mean
Ain't nothing but the motherfucker lifer in me
Leather seats, 20 racks in my jeans
Ain't nothing but the motherfucker lifer in me
