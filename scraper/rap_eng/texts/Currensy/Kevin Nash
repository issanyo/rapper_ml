Word to Big Tray Dee
They got lil bitty niggas ridin around on they mufakin bikes wit 9's
Itchy trigga finger fever lookin for a reason to squeeze it
He got a gun cause his opp got one
He can't get caught without it, and get rocked
Plus a chick that he like live on the other side
By them niggas who smoked his partner over a couple a dollars
Dice games put a strain on friendships
You'll get flipped over chips nigga real quick
I'm just delivering that real shit
Speaking from experience
Because me and my dogs livin it
Risking it all and not knowin
Just being silent for my big homies
Lettin em know that they can count on us
Depend on it to be delivered on time
By some young niggas who about business intended for millions
Touched that and extended that division to billions
My brothers ?nerves? back
He in the window
Rifled up like Malcolm X in that picture
His lil bro in the booth laying that playa shit
He just protecting the situation
And waiting for yall to come up with crazy shit

Buck em down
Buck em down
Buck em down
(Repeats 4X)

Keep the key in it
Chevys on switches
Smokin weed in it
Laughing in our pictures
Wouldn’t talk about it
If niggas didn’t live it
If you need to see it
You can come and visit
If you don’t believe me
Then ask one of your bitches
If she bad, she probly kick it
So clean its ridiculous
Hurts you to admit it
