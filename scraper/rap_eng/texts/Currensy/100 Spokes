[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x3)

[Verse 1]
Cut a moon roof in the '72
That's what the paper tell me do
Spaceship came through, slayed you
Thinkin' that the game new, fool who raised you?
I ain't got time to save you
Paydays I'm on the way to
State to state, many a stage and venue
The stoned saga continues
I'm fin to, collect more residuals
Off digitals and physical
Record in the fortress stable of Ferrari horses
Paved the driveway parked exotics on it
Looking at 'em just make me want more shit
I'm addicted to this hustle I'm so sick
Tug of war with my girl cause I can't split into two people
Wanna work just as bad as I wanna be with you
Sitting in my homeboys Regal, higher than a eagle
Thinking of a loophole to squeeze through
Leave to that paper that's church, cathedral
Take my Kangol off before I enter the bistro
Crooks gotta eat too, in a castle with platters of seafood
Lavish extravagance wishing it could be you
See you when I see you
And when I do don't be looking all evil and deceitful

[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x5)

[Verse 2]
Boat launch in the backyard
Warehouse garage, full of sports cars
Should inspire you to go for it
I did this you could do so much more
What you waiting on, we got planes to board
High before takin' off, pulling up in racers at the Bape store
Bout paper, my bank chase but baby girl I won't chase ya
I've got aim and a laser, red beam on a stack of green
Contact me if it's a major caper
A dollar and a dream
We can pull it off while them mufuckas sleep like they always be
Look to the set if you're looking for the best
No rest until I see all my dogs eat
Quest for greatness, hella early in the latest
You ain't even know they made this shit
Nigga

[Chorus]
100 spokes and new clothes (x5)
