You can pay me now (F.S. Jets)
You can pay me now (cut the fuckin' check)
You can pay me now (F.S. Jets)
You can pay me now (Where haven't we been yet)
You can pay me now (you can pay me now) (x4)

[Verse 1]
You want to hate me, then hate me, what can I do
But keep gettin' money and make sure I shit on you
Come through, in the El-Ca-Mino, 502 rumblin'
Nigga I've got a need for speed, away from these fleas
Bitch ass-ness is a disease and you need a vaccine
Come through the club, slide through the scene
Take all the bitches, fuck up your night like a bad dream
Yeah, F.S. Jet set, fast cars, good weed, hot sex
Bad bitches stay comin' through the set
Tryin' to get under them wings
Cause the planes got the best of everything
Bring out the buckets of champagne
The family close-knit, that's how we maintain
Keep it real with my niggas who been with me through the struggle
Cause fuckin' with new niggas will fuck up your hustle

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sooner or later we'll all see who the profit is
Cut the debatin', the labels know who the hottest is
That's why my phone ringin' off the hook
They making offers, I got a few that could be a good look
Wrigglin' free from the red tape could a couple minutes
But I'm pretty sure a couple mill will help me deal with it
Throw a party in the buildin' with chandeliers in it
Write my album at a summer home I own in Martha's Vineyard
I'm thinkin' on a level other niggas ain't thinkin'
I'm Carnival cruisin' homie, your battleship sinkin'
The life ya'll can't see if your drownin' in the deep end
Hip-Hop ain't dead, she just play sleepin'
Till you pussy niggas slip and let a real nigga sneak in
Another offer comin' got my telephone ringin'
Another flight booked, I gotta' take another meetin'
I tell them save their breath and let their money do the speakin'

[Hook]
