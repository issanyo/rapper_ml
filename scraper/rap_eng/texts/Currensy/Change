[Intro]
Yeah, yo we're (?)
I'm drunk as a fool

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
No, usually I don't do this but
I roll a joint so I get through to ya
Get hella high about my paper though
Come pick you up and we go out to Clippers not the Lakers
Balling brings a lot of haters
A bar stay on me, a lot of favors
A lot of favors, roll that weed, we get them skyscrapers
What we doin' with our time?
Gettin' fly, finding classic whips to buy
Bigger fish to fry
One of y'all you can see it in my eyes
Money long, you can tell by what I just put in my ride
When you won niggas wish for you demise
Nothin' wrong, we can see through your disguise, 09

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Niggas is shape shiftin', transformers on us
Jealous of position, envious of performance
I'm forever on it
Known for cookin' audio dope and gettin' off it
Pots under the faucet
The right temperature, we toss it
You want that work, you gotta come and see the bosses
First tuck in your shirt cut that fuckin' nonsense
When in Rome do as the Romans
You wouldn't know because you never goin'
A lot of niggas doin' hella ho shit
And not notice
Motherfuckers know that I'm not for it
You'll be extorted
We came for the paper, cake slices, large portions
Race Porsches to California by the mornin'

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
Shit change, bitches change, niggas change
We never change, we never change
