[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Smoking a hundred dollar joint
Major presentation, nigga Power Point
Homes, hesitation never been a choice
Early bird gets the Rolls Royce
Baby cakes Duncan Hines moist
Cause that money make her come anywhere I am
She not dumb anytime she hear my voice
Like a money machine luxury fiend
Do anything survive the cobra's clutches
Hopscotch hot coals on solid gold crutches bitch cold
Ice man can't touch it half court raining buckets
Star struck bitches behaving like lightning hit 'em
Hold they hearts I'm in the building
Oh lord Andretti killed 'em
When they swung that '76 glass house three wheeling
Surveillance vans parked up the block tryna peep the dealings
Like I don't see them
I tell my bitch to bring them a nice pitcher of ice tea since they thirsty
Out right parched for the downfall of a boss
Homie not me soon as one ends another one start this is season six
We take the food plate and table cloths from a sip off rip lock your shit

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
And I find myself blunted
One million dollar thoughts I'm just tryna make some money
Turn my rainy day sunny
Frank White style, my city I run it, skinny nigga turned chubby
For safety my burner under my Rugby
Either hate me or love me I'm purple label my luggage
Uh, I try my best to dodge trouble
You see Spitta my brother, you catch us puffing in public
Trill nigga one hundred better yet one thousand
Good God, will I make it out this jungle
I'm just a nigga from the bricks with a bitch who's from London
Big dog Bill Russell from a bucket to a Hummer
They say the good die young I've seen the pretty turn ugly
They either shoot they stick at a bitch or shoot cutters
They heard me to my stomach so his momma cry a puddle
420 vision from up hereâ€™s mad blurry
