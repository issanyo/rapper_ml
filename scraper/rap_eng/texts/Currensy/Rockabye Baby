[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
This that, brick cellphone tracksuit shelltoes
Rolling up my sleeve show em' how time froze
Cocaine 80's, roofless Mercedes
It get ruthless & gruesome you refuse to pay me
We in it for the loot everyday thinking of different ways
To eliminate them other factions in the way
All about that increase pedal like a ten speed
Competitions are labeled deceased upon arrival
[Verse 2 - Fiend]
Love it of leave it, you can't act the door you don't need it
Them bundles like a blessing and i'm blessed to receive it
Block bleedin', eh i'm high [?] like the b-ball court i'm always jumping
Got green in that Fed-Ex box like 94'
Got zips, got halves, wholes, ordering nine more
JLR gettin' ends until the end
This for my Jeeps, Bentley trucks, Range Rovers, & the Benz
[Verse 3 - Curren$y]
Metal Gear Solid rifles, Don Logan dashboard bibles
Smelling like a pound when I walk by ya
They claim not to like us
Looking for my lighter trying to ignite the fire
Exotic driver, quality pot buyer
Provider of fine rhymes
Come into the cockpit mama & meet the pilot
Getting higher as my dough risin'
Got the helicopter candy like my lowrider
