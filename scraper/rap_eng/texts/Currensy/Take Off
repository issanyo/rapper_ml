[Intro]
Yeah
Let me breathe for a minute
Ight (clears throat)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
That "Where Da Cash At" video was a lot of fun
Took my royalty check and I bought a lot of guns
Took a little bit of change and bought some more whips
Cause I had enough guns to hold down all that shit
The rest of the money, I invested it
Stocks and bonds that was advice from my Moms
I bought a couple of shares of Louis Vuitton
Chanel, Gucci, and Benetton
United colors, we the flyest brothers
We fly and hover over you land lovers
You man lover
Wait I'm gonna come right back

[Verse 2]
Boston George or should I say New Orleans Nelson
Young Money fans waiting on my solo album
Be cool it'll be here in a minute
I'mma show you more games then the mothafucking Olympics
I'm tempted to go and cop me one of them Benzes
SLR's with vertical lifting doors
Step out on the red carpet and then I pause (See Me)
Yeah
Let the paparazzi get a eyefull
I feel like slim muhfucker I'm way overdosed

Young Money nigga, Fly Society
Young Money nigga, Fly Society
Young Money nigga, yeah
