[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, everybody should have their joints lit
Yeah, roll another one up while I'm smokin', keep it goin'
Money and the power and some more shit, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll another one up while I'm smokin', keep it goin'
Money and the power and some more shit, we stayin' in motion
Never will I get into no hoe shit, I'm not for it
Stay golden, frozen, floatin', motherfuckin' Billy Ocean

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
You can act like you don't know, Spitta and Cardo
Bullet proof German coupe car doors close, take photos
Car shows in my lo-lows
My sixty-four ride slow, bumpin' Snoop Dogg, blowin' dolo
It's like a fog machine done went off in my car yo
Pull up after all the bars close to the civilians, underground casinos
For the real ones, you would suffocate in the buildin'
Last one tried to infiltrate I think they, I'd rather not say
Money on the plate like I never ate, not a crumb finna go to waste
Chevy crates tear the Interstate up where I stay
Muscle cars do the figure eights where I play
Live from New Orleans, rollin' weed from the Bay
RIP Nate Dogg, smoke weed everyday
Livin' out what I say on these albums and tapes

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll another one up while I'm smokin', keep it goin'
Money and the power and some more shit, we stayin' in motion
Never will I get into no hoe shit, I'm not for it
Stay golden, frozen, floatin', motherfuckin' Billy Ocean

[Bridge: Curren$y]
Yeah, act like you don't know, Spitta and Cardo
Money and power and some more shit, we stayin' in motion
Never will I get into no hoe shit, I'm not for it
Stay golden, frozen, floatin', nigga Billy Ocean

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Nigga whatchu know, that original dope flow
Stained glass cathedral ceilings and marble floors
Hustle hard to afford, I work for it
Sports cars I drive slow, I'ma show off
Sucka bring his hoe, he got his hoe tossed
He cried alone in his car as he drove off
Highed up as I float on, they gon' have to call the fuckin' coast guard, shit

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll another one up while I'm smokin', keep it goin'
Money and the power and some more shit, we stayin' in motion
Never will I get into no hoe shit, I'm not for it
Stay golden, frozen, floatin', mother fuckin' Billy Ocean

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah never will I get into no hoe shit, nope, I'm not for it
Money and the power and some more shit
We stay in motion, never will I get into no ho shit, I'm not for it
Stay golden, frozen, floatin', nigga Billy Ocean
Yeah, yeah, yeah, not for it
