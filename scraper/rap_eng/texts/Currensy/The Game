[Intro]
Yeah hey yeah, she ain't for you she for the game
Tryna get a piece a everything
She ain't for you she for the gang

[Verse 1]
Niggas and they feelings am in the bank
Back stroking in the shark tank
Figure Cause i'm smoke out that i can't think
It’s the king of smoking maintain on that super dang
She feels safe in the coop it's like a tank
Still got to  ducked em potholes
Causing damage  to the forgy idahoes
I navigate the  city boobytrap with mah eyes close
Too quick on mah shell toes for them hoes
More focused on money roles
Captain new roles suicidal too tho
I get that work out got in versace gym clothes
You old heads i’ll tell you that i've been cold
Had it all figured out from fifteen years old
Playin mah cut playing the role
Know when i'd be chose
Money running bulshit walkin
Vvs diamonds do mah talking
She ain't for you she for the gang
Pussy for the gang

[Hook]
She try to get a piece of everything
She ain't for you she for the gang
Gold diggers eye fucking mah pinky ring
She ain't for you she for the gang
She try to get a piece of everything
She ain't for you she for the gang
In the club just following the champagne

[Verse 2]
She ain't yours she for the Chanel furs
Leah jets horderves  and hard to pronounce words
Either you rap tackle a quarterback or flip burgs
Only way you'll get a piece a hers
Financially secure bentley chauffeur
Got that bitch mind in a blur in a mur
Shaping up line  a that pur
For this addiction there is no cure
It's the game in her veins
Now she feel niggas with no doe is lame
Attracted to chains and pinky rings
She Doing hella things strange for a piece a change
Or Just a promise that the boss might fly her to the bahamas
A G might fuck her on the back of a hung honda
You you gon try to make her the baby mama
Make her honest that clownish because for sure not not bout it

[Hook]
She ain't for you she for the gang
She Tryna get a piece of everything
She ain't for you she for the gang
Gold diggers Eye fucking mah pinky ring
She ain't for you she for the gang
She Tryna get a piece of everything
She ain't for you she for the gang
In the club just following the champagne
