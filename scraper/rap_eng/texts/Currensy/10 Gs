[Hook x8]
I can take ten Gs, and make twenty more ten Gs with that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm back in this bitch
Though I never left
I just took a lil time, climb some trees by myself
Now I'm way up high, everything top-shelf
We ain't die last night, toast to good health
We was fly last night if I do say so myself
Had all eyes last night, them hoes ain't wanna miss the jet
Million dollars worth of Chevys, yeah bitch its da set
Andretti, they ainâ€™t ready, so I won't do it yet
Y'all can play for a couple of weeks
And I be back to destroyin' the streets
The homie Cardo keep sending me beats, and I smoke 'em
They think I'm selling drugs, nah, bitch, I'm just a dopeman
I woke up and I float from New Orleans to Oakland
The bro Cellski left the green door open
I'm in the Nova, that 383 stroking
Gas or that cash flow, that's what keep me going

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
Now I turn the corners, yo bitch watching my car
Got that weed burning, she wish she could hit the raw
Now she's lurking, cause she like what she saw
On Twitter and Instagram, searching the bar
'Til by chance we meet again, don't be sleeping in
On the outside, peeking in
On your tiptoes tryna see over our fence, ho
It's quite simple, see you was fishing for simps
We not them though, focus up, this game soak it up
She can't handle it, it's choking her, whoa
Open that door before she barf on my Monte Carlo floor
Sorry, no, we can't kick it no mo'
Must go back to the Gold rush, brush
Bust through, knock down all those who would oppose
Us getting dough, yo, let's all be millionaires
