(Verse1)
I Been In The Game Tim Duncan Hope The Benz Dont Spur Out Of Control
Because Only God Know My Thoughts & My Highest Goals
Go, Bugatti Tires Smooth How We Roll
Up Right Here We Dont Got To Take It Outside
The Flyest Nigga You'll Prolly See In Ya Life Time
The Highest Nigga You Seeing All On Ya Time Line
ReTweet A Nigga If You Fucking With The Gang Though
Off The Lot Bema Coop With The Brains Gone
Same Shit Different Hoes But The Same Song
Switching Through These Bitches Like Im Just Changing My Ringtone
High Ass Fuck But Im Suited For The Occasion Though
Wishing That This Bitch Would Hurry Up I got Places To Go
Bitches To Fuck Weed To Smoke & Shit To Do
Like This Money Before Its Gone & Skate With The Crew
I Hear Some Bitches From Your Section Thats Cool Fool

(Hook)
Drinking Out The Hennessy Bottle
Honstely Do You Want Me As Your RoleModel
To The Kid Who Chose Me To Follow
Life Ain't Nothing But Loud Weed & Pradas

(Outro)
