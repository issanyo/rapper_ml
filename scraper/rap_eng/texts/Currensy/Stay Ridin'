[Verse 1]
Spent 300 thousand on it
Parked it on the corner like i didnt want it
Blowing killer in New Orleans
Feel like I'm in California
Zoning off a OG onion
I text the homie with the gas
And he said he coming back with a different pack
What we smoking now the truth
He say this shit colder than that
I store my shit in glass I prefer that over bags
We gon' crack a jar before we get in the car
I push a button the roof lit up with stars

[Hook]
Now we gon stay ridin' stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin' aint hiding, yeah
They hidin' aint bout it, yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Ain't hidin' stay ridin', yeah
They hidin' ain't bout it

[Verse 2]
See me in it straight chillin'
Candy paint, crate engine
Dana Dane, 13 inches
Low ride, stay high off the gas
Don't drink and drive so the four don't crash
Now cash rules, flash jewels on occasion
When I past through but if I pass through you know they paid me
Stack it till we got no where to put it
When I drive the Flying Spur I park the bitch crooked
So you can see the Forgiato's on it when you look in
Before we open the champagne bottles we shook 'em
It's a celebration so we let this shit spill
We could have been killed in the field and that's real
But we still here fuck a hater and how he feel
That's signed and sealed
Straight deal quarter mill on the wheels
You gotta drive the bitch with skill
My engine in the back
My neighborhood on my hat
We gon'

[Hook]
Stay ridin' stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin' aint hiding, yeah
They hidin', aint bout it, yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Stay ridin', stay ridin', yeah
Ain't hidin' stay ridin', yeah
They hidin' ain't bout it
