Jet Life, Jet Life, Jet Life
Uh, that Jet Life, Jet Life nigga yeaaah
Uh, Jet Life, Jet LIfe nigga
Yeaaah

[Verse 1 - Young Roddy]
Cut the checks I came to get the butters
Live from the gutta, intelligent motherfucker
Since I been at bat these wack rappers been in trouble
And Roddy stand tall even when I'm outnumbered
Ain't no lie, she say she comfortable in my covers
Tryna hide my keys, hide my phone, hide my rubbers
My other gig laying that pipe down I'm a plumber
From sun down to sun up I'm plotting on my come up
You sho nuff cough up a lung where the fuck I come from
Don't get me twisted, I'm no swisher sweet blunt
It's best cop yo own shit, mother fuck a front
Cause mama got some ass you can see from the front
I'm talking back like a camel
In that bed I'm an animal
Betcha she can't handle it when I'm gone off that cannabis
Her brain excellent, my brain scrambling
Yeaaauh

[Hook - (2x)]
Her brain excellent, my brain scrambling
Betcha she can't handle it when I'm gone off that cannabis
Her brain excellent, my brain scrambling
Yeaaauh, Jet Life nigga

[Verse 2 - Trademark Da Skydiver]
See no speak no evil
Trade need this paper like a fiend need the needle
When I'm on the track I'm pulling stunts like Knievel
If my life is like a movie, then Young Roddy is the sequel
And Spitta is the prequel
As far as the rest of y'all go, y'all ain't no where equal
Trade spit Ether, flow so lethal
Money stacking in, ya ho posted chiefing
She said she want a villain, she so tired of the weaklings
I'm speaking on behalf of the real niggas eating
Play tme is over, this game too easy
I'm bound to hit a lick sooner or later, oh believe me
I'm posted up steaming
High nights living that Jet Life, rookie of the season, Trade really beaming
MVP of the league, I'm beasting
Bitch give me head like she feasting
Got a nigga tweaking
Excellent brain, watch her suck me down like she teething

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Curren$y]
A lemon to a lime, I'm on yo bitch mind
Empire on the rise all by my design
Been on crutches for a couple months, that's fine
My bottom bitch running errands for me all the time
Blood type G, positive I'm on that loud, on my grind
On that road, in that '95 SS Camaro hood scoop with the slanted eyes
Homie step aside, I make turns wide
Getting dome while I drive, trying not to close my eyes
Maintain my focus, don't wanna crash
Doing some shit I could have done in my pad
But yeah this bitch working it out like a counselor
Head doctor you can count on for house calls
Might see me in front of her crib
Ducked off getting scooped up with my headlights off

[Hook]
