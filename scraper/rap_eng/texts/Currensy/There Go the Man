[Intro]
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man in this bitch
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who

[Verse 1]
Swang like swords on the boulevard
Love from the broads get 'em high fuck 'em hard
Smokin' in my yard looking at my cars
Try to pick 'em out I like to switch 'em up before the night falls
Stunting just a little bit if you gotta call it something
I'm just tryna show you how to come up out of nothing
Get a progress from the struggle
Out West smoking killa onions
Me and [?] bong snap shatter wax pimpin' all that
Penning raps counting paper stacks
Jet Life on the map
Bong snap shatter wax nigga all that
Penning raps counting stacks Jet Life on the map

[Chorus]
Uh
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man in this bitch
It ain't hard to tell who the man
When I come through with your whole advance on my wrist
Uh
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man in this bitch
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
When I come through with your whole advance on my wrist nigga

[Verse 2]
All I'm tryna do is get my cash on
All I'm tryna do is run them numbers up
Get something smart and sexy I could smash on
We got four bad bitches in the truck with us
I smoke 'em to the face I never pass 'em
But I'll toss you the bag and let you roll one up
Friday night we pull out them Italians
Thats Ferrari's Lamborghini's coming out the cut, yea

[Chorus]
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man in this bitch
It ain't hard to tell who the man
When I come through with your whole advance on my wrist nigga
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man
It ain't hard to tell who the man in this bitch

[Outro]
It ain't hard to tell
It ain't hard to tell
It ain't hard to tell
Homie you know me well
