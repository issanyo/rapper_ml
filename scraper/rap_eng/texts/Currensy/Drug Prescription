[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Da da da da
Yeah

[Verse 1]
On a mission to grab it, stash it
Kilos of gold bars, black cards, plastic
Swipe a nigga life away, transactions, his wife stood by, gaspin'
Can’t believe the shit happened
Now she grieving in the madness
When I ceased these little niggas is pulling triggers
And they clapping at the OG’s, it ain’t safe
Either is yours or Carlito’s way still the same if its still a game
No love thang, just slugs, what up man?
Hustlin' to avoid our strugglin'
As soon as it goes from nothin' to stuntin'
Ferrari's parked, leave 'em covered 'til the summer
Bring 'em out when I really feel like I gotta kill something
It feel like she comin' when she seen a real nigga come up
Just knowin' I can have her
I ain't really gotta fuck her, ask her new cuttin'
Mind sex, offset on my dune buggies, I progress forward
Motions stay goin', you can tell them hoes rollin'
Drug prescriptions, got 'em open, I'm the one who wrote it

[Hook]
Drug prescriptions, got 'em open, I'm the one who wrote it (x5)
Like a doctor or the phantom of the opera

[Verse 2]
Though I'm not in the phantom I'm probably in my low rider
Drivin' 'em cause I got 'em all options, chrome bottoms
Interior imperial, shit be fit for emperors
She be tryin' to kick it like a ninja bitch
My homies finna flip her like a half a brick
These other rappers out ain't half as sick
All that half-ass shit will get your ho ass whipped
Shorts and losses, not accepted by bosses
I can tell you don't be up here often cause your eyes waterin'
You coughin', that gas I got'll have you nauseous
You lost in the midst of this the real shit
Big fish, shark tank
Don't get bit nigga get bank
Get you and get the fuck out the game
Take advice from niggas who survived and maintained by doing the same thing
Then you twist your shit and carry on man
Drug prescriptions, got 'em open, I'm the one who wrote it
Drug prescriptions, got 'em open, I'm the one who wrote it

[Hook]
