This shit is jamming so hard
It feels like a movie...

[Verse 1: Scotty ATL]
Got me feeling like Money Mitch
Catch blaze and flickin my wrist
Soccer game with my dawgs we kickin that shit
She's an amateur driver I teach her to stick
Tired of the feds , now i'm trying to teach her to [?]

Incredible, incredible
You are incredible, incredible
You are, you are incredible
You are, you are incredible
You are...

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Flow knock the man off your polo sweater
Bentley anthracite but a soft leather
New Orleans and Atlanta together
For the cheddar my nigga
Who else could do it better ?
Whenever, whatever, I'm ready and prepared for
Combat, the industry's at war
My nigga what type of music do you stand for ?
Pinky rings outstand and I'ma handful
Grip Kool Aid or Rosé in a Champagne flute
A black prince in a purple rain coupe
Confortable on stage they mention the projects
Stoops either way make it do what it do
What it does, Carolina and Jordan 1's
Baby bags Céline with seaweed green
You got some people with you nigga but I got a team

[Hook:]
Incredible, incredible
You are incredible, incredible
You are, you are incredible
You are, you are incredible
You are...

[Outro: Scotty ATL]
Simply the best, no illuminati
