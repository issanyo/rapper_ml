[Chorus]
Pressure
Pressure, Pressure
Stay applyin pressure
Pressure, Pressure
Stay applyin' pressure
New Rolexs that's pressure
Diamond necklace that's pressure
Back to back Chevy's pressure
We stayin' applyin' pressure
Pressure, what's pressure?
We stay applyin' pressure
What's pressure, that's pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
New Rolexs that's pressure
Diamond necklace that's pressure
Back to back Chevy's that's pressure
We stay applyin' pressure

[Verse]
Rubber band knots
Hunnid grand money stretchen
No stressin, more flexin
Bust that check get the next one
That's pressure, what's pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
What's pressure, this pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
They are not on my level now
Lil niggas need to get this shit together
No you do not have forever
You the past tense in a matter of seconds my nigga
What's pressure, this pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
What's pressure, this pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
They are not on my level now
Lil niggas need to get this shit together
You do not have forever
You the past tense in a matter of seconds
Teenagers with MAC-11's
Why gun flyin, cause their hammers too heavy
Seen niggas that blast whoever
See, you can get smashed where ever
But I'm outside all the time ride 'round
How I got the figures on my mind
Fog lights in the day time
Stunting on you bet you love it though
New money in the same clothes I wore yesterday
Last night we went from the club straight to the studio
I ain't get a chance to change up
For views gettin on that pagebook
Take it back to the crib for the flavor
My closet lookin like Melrose
Walk in some mufuckin spaceships
My bitch want me to build her a stripper pole

[Chorus]
Pressure
Pressure, Pressure
Stay applyin pressure
Pressure, Pressure
Stay applyin' pressure
New Rolexs that's pressure
Diamond necklace that's pressure
Back to back Chevy's pressure
We stayin' applyin' pressure
Pressure, what's pressure?
We stay applyin' pressure
What's pressure, that's pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
New Rolexs that's pressure
Diamond necklace that's pressure
Back to back Chevy's that's pressure
We stay applyin' pressure
