[Hook: Curren$y]
Had to make a way, had to make a play
Give a fuck what it cost, I had to drive that Wraith
Had to make a way, had to make a play
I don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today

[Verse: Curren$y]
And it's not a discussion of color
Different races, though we all brothers
If we in the same struggle, all on the same hustle
Tryna get all the pieces to the puzzle
In the right spot and see how beautiful it turned out
The big picture
Me countin' millions, dividin' them amongst my team and they providin' for their children
Jet Life an empire, though I'm still buildin'
You can always expand, develop on land
Where no other businesses stand
You can be a pioneer man, like the hood air conditioning
Open window with the box fan in it
My nigga authentic
Moet, Rose, Nectar Imperial, smokin' a bowl
Then I prepare a bowl of cereal
The angel on the Rolls Royce got me feelin' spiritual
Same time, one phone call and send them hitters through
Bag of silencers in that black Beamer coupe
You ain't dreaming fool

[Hook: Curren$y]
Had to make a way, had to make a play
Give a fuck what it cost, I had to drive that Wraith
Had to make a way, had to make a play
I don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today
Had to make a way, had to make a play
Give a fuck what it cost, I had to drive that Wraith
Had to make a way, had to make a play
I don't give a fuck, cause I could lose it all today

[Outro: Curren$y]
Had to make a way, had to make a play
Give a fuck what it cost, I had to drive that Wraith
One thing about me they say I'm always in the Bape
Ballin', dribblin', switchin' lanes all day
