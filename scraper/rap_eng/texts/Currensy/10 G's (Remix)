[Intro: Curren$y]
Let's all be millionaires

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]
I can take ten G's, and make twenty more ten G's with that

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I'm still at it, they still mad
Her friends hated, but I still smashed
She went braggin' how much fun she had
And now them hoes wanna roll, but that jet done passed
Steak and shrimp on the plane 'til it's 'bout to land
Learn to correctly say the name of where I really am
Buyin' antiques, foreign lamps
Passport, stamps on every page
Old head paper like Zig-Zags, bitch I've been paid
New Benjamins, Raw wraps, cones to the dome
Lone Ranger park the Range on the range
Countin' twenty G's in my D-boy stance
Rap like keys, open vaults to the racks
Niggas like me want all of that, and some mo' of that
Go on and show me where they store it at (go on)
Let's all be millionaires
I heard they got a whole lot of shit in there

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Hundred G's on one block, gave straps, go move blocks
We move blocks on one block
I told my nigga we close shop
'89 we came through, that triple beam, we weigh it through
Nigga wanna play games, nigga
We size 'em up when we come through
Them thangs came, we did that
They say, we did that
Came down from H-Town, I told a nigga we moved that
Uptown my block, nigga
We came through, straight stock, nigga
People came, we popped, nigga
Ain't nothin' came from gettin' money
We did that
Catch me stuntin', nigga, every time, so we live this
Top floor, we grind, nigga
When I stunt, nigga, we shine, nigga
It's big money all the time, nigga
It's my life, big time, nigga
New whips, new bitches, nigga
Got that forty with the clip, nigga
Mill on my mind, nigga
Fuck 'em nigga headline, nigga

[Bridge: Curren$y]
Let's all be millionaires

[Hook (x8): Curren$y]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
I can take nothin', turn it to stuntin'
I do it for ya'll, cause ya'll thought that I couldn't
Told my momma we made it, she said you finally famous
She say that's a blessing, knowing how cut-throat this game is
Turn a five to a ten, a ten to a Benz
Turned one crack rock into a neck full of gems
Had no choices or options, forced to be great
When you walk amongst bosses, hope you relate
Grew up poorer than most, nigga had no bread
But I was holdin' my toast, my back touchin' my ribs
Had to get it, by any means, necessary
Never scary, goin' hard like I won't be ever buried
Boxed in these projects, never felt my palm itch
Niggas lifes cut short by these long clips
How I made it out, still a mystery
Cause Lord knows (how treacherous these mean streets can be)
