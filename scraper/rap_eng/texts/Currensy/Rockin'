Hot Spitta nigga

Young Money Cash Money
Yah
Shout out to my nigga Cannon

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Don’t knock it ‘cause you can’t stop it
Your woman done jumped out her pocket
Looking at my rings and my watch
She so off the chain somebody call the locksmith
If that’s your girl you better get her man
Before I leave out this motherfucker man
One minute y’all was kissing taking pictures man
Now she forgot that she was even with you man
Damn
Y’all was a cute couple
Just because I hit that don’t mean that she don’t love you
Hate to bring trouble to your world
Hot Spitta nigga just duffle bagged you girl
I didn’t even try
Cause she was in the club fucking me with her eyes
And now she in the spot fucking me and my guys
She ain't  gon’ stop ‘til me and my niggas tired

[Hook: Curren$y]
I walk by and she be watching
Digging how my music knocking
Your girl feel how a nigga be rocking
Yup she feel how a nigga be rocking
When I’m walking she be locing
Wishing that a nigga was off in that pussy
Your girl feel how a nigga be rocking
Yup she feel how a nigga be rocking

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]

Boo snatcher, happy home breaker-upper
Homeboy I make life tougher
For simps and fake pimps and hand-cuffers
Type of niggas that smash once and say they love her
Ha ha
I laugh at ya’ll
Go ahead and wife the freak I ain't mad at ya’ll
Shit
I have your bitch missing for two days
On an island with a foreign chick going two ways
No service on the cell phones or two ways
Now you starting a fiasco like Lupe
Ha
She say she never (?) this, she say she never tried
But now I got the bitch on heads like toupees
Wake up in the morning and I’m her toothpaste
Young hooky homeboy, that’s what your boo say
But not ‘cause I cut class
Ain't it ‘cause I cut ass
While you cut grass
Ha
You making love, she like to fuck fast
Ha
That’s why she cheating on your duck ass
Quack quack
But she probably pass back through the crib homeboy
Just to pack

Fake tenderoni, kinda fake Casanova

[Hook: Curren$y]
I walk by and she be watching
Digging how my music knocking
Your girl feel how a nigga be rocking
Yup she feel how a nigga be rocking
When I’m walking she be locing
Wishing that a nigga was off in that pussy
Your girl feel how a nigga be rocking
Yup she feel how a nigga be rocking
