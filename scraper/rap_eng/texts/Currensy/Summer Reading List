This time for all the marbles y'all
If not now then when
Spit vicious and proud of it
In the future
My city will build monuments
Listin' my accomplishments
Like the soles on my Jordan 10s
Rock the Ralph Lauren cardigan
2008 gone with the wind
Curren$y is starrin' in major motion pictures
Life of the set
Killin' em with the charisma
Fly private jets with the wifey
Continental for the side piece
But at least it's first class shit
Bitches be happy for a shot
At that first class dick
Her carry on bags got the purp stashed in
Ride around blastin'
Empty Delaware punch cans for the ashes
Serious as a heart attack
Doin' my own thing
And ghost writin' on the side
Homie try Cyrano de Bergerac
Better lookin'
Hope I didn't go over your head
I read a lot of books man
In the studio burnin' a pound
Loc'in on a plant of the Junior Brown
Make fly tracks
Those go to the Zune
Bumpin in the airport
Walkin' with a Crooks & Castle duffle full of shoes
My girl got the roll away Lou
She hold a nigga down
So I lace her up
I drive her vet
And let her take my truck
Niggas mad
I see 'em every second
They turnin' greener
The envy eatin' em up
They gettin' thinner
Stephen King writin'
Keep the lame niggas frightened
Air Max 95s
Red & Green
NBA Live
Sega Genesis
OG
Nigga what you think this is
Straight up on the real pimpin'
Square biz
