[Corner Boy P]
Shit nigga, my mind on the dough, ridin' round in that bowtie got the shift on the floor
You dont know where these niggas minds at when they plot on the dough
So i ride around extra burner, extra clips in the door
Gettin' paranoid in the day people might kick in the door
But when u paper chase you chase that paper far as it go
Cause id rather be tired from hustlin', then tired of havin' nothing
So i go out the way to make sure my pockets stay straight
Nigga i go alil' further, same streets swore they murdered
Same streets i call home might lead me to a goner
But i ride for this corner & ever nigga thats on it
I seen the best come and go niggas even die with it on 'em
& i can't call it, just answer everytime that money is calling
She call me, dog, just what she only callin' me cause im ballin'
They all doubted underestimated and underrated, its all good fuck them niggas as long as they dont underpay me

La la la la la la la la
My steerin' wheel wood, my weed hella' good
My rolex yellow gold, im flexin on them hoes
Them bitches strike a pose, they hopin' that i look
Im finna head home love you tryin get took
Jet life & i wrote it down in eli's book
Im higher then the plane, wayne writin down hooks
Couple bars here & there, couple honeys on the lair
See my camp get low, love can't stop the crooks
Rap moves for the paper, every caper, every jooks??
Keep gas in the scrapers, and them haters not my neighbors
Got some marksman insuring me that they on the roof
They help me sleep better, dozed off, countin cheddar
Woke up, washed up, rolled up to the loot
Polygraph in the booth make every line a truth
An a eye for an eye, & a tooth for a tooth
Leave alot of niggas blind & unable to chew!
