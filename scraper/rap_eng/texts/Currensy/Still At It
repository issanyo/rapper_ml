[Verse 1]
Yellow paper, legal pad
Blueprinting these criminal plans
So simple in the right hands
Shit'll go cool as a fan
Long as we keep it in the fam
Grinding with outsiders will only provide us
Providers with more problems
Cops want see me locked in
Bars, concrete but only palm trees around me
My rollie heavy, my shirt light
Let me roll back my sleeves
Let my diamonds breathe, serenade the night
Sung that bitch to sleep
Woke up next to me
And figured she was still up in the dream
Dirty money, keep them whips clean
Coupes for the whole team
Lyrics is on a triple beam
Another tape, another key
A frozen eskimo ain't cold as me
Nigga, (cold as me)

[Hook]
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
In the city of Saints, stunters and gun clappers
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
In the city of Saints, stunters and gun clappers
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics

[Verse 2]
Still in traffic, sports cars doing magic
My doors open backwards
My homegirl an actress
Silver screen bad bitch
She brought her homegirls through
We call that batting practice
I'm in the matte black six
100 Benz mashing
Interior filled with gases
And bitch, I'm never passing
Music is the crack, It's
Moving like packs, If
I put 2 in
You best believe I'm bringing 4
Bad bitch huh

[Hook]
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
In the city of Saints, stunters and gun clappers
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
You mad they just looking at us
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
In the city of Saints, stunters and gun clappers
Still at it, Jet Set mathematics
You mad they just looking at us
