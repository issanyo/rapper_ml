Blown away (2X)
So blown away, blown away

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, raps I buss 'em
Problems with my life, don't discuss 'em
Coupes and leer jets, I lust them
Can't hear them haters talk, I'm above them
But they push me to do it, that's why I love them
Fitting snub in the Chevy seat
Nigga you see the future, that's ahead of me
And wish that it was cease to be
Buzz and cruise until it became a bang
Jet planes in the building, bitch we do our thang
Who the main maneuver
The coup in Vancouver
Canadian ladies is speaking the fly language
I'm partially famous, popularity gaining
They wondering when I blow
Am I gonna lose my other ground
So, the answer is hell no
I'm definitely maintaining, I'm way too G
The other niggas do their thang, but them niggas ain't me
Wear what you can't buy, that's why I'm what they can't be

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Roll something up, Mama we can smoke in here
Sneak in here and wink, temps I never bought a pair
Out of dress codes, still getting in there
Girlfriend now rolling like a wheelchair
MDMA and THC combining
She high climbing into the truck
We ridin, jack move fool
Ain't no denying the cool
The mirror image ain't quick enough to mimic my moves
You niggas talk as shallow as a kiddie pool
Can't articulate themselves in their interviews
Rappers on a respirators, breathing through a tube
Reviving with the live shit, we make it good as new
Tired of hearin jive shit? My nigga me too
Bad bitches want the real, baby girl I feel you
Only thing I can do is move pen or pencil
Write and smoke my life away as I continue

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Try to act like you ain't know The Planes got it
I'm in Chi-town smoking like a train Charlotte
Never match, they say I dress train spotter
I just stay up collecting sky mileage
I'm a high pilot
You must acknowledge the fact that I'm not a novice
Professional driver on a closed circuit
Monster Beats got NASCAR Spitta on them tracks, perfect
Grind outta my mind because it's so worth it
Enable Spitta to make a big purchase
3 story crib, driveway half-circle
Dodge Barracuda, nigga
Concrete surfer
Engine growling like a rottweiler trynna hurt ya
Bags of purple
Strong enough To Stephan Urquille outta Urkel
Spitta hand deliver fly verses free
Accidents on purpose
