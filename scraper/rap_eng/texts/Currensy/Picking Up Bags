Money in the duffel
All result of the hustle
Reminiscing the struggle
Keep a nigga humble
Rolling up a jumbo
Associated with the pot like gumbo
Nigga name hot hear them haters mumble
Can't understand that talk, it's not boss
We killing in smalls, y'all niggas is not large
Tryna duck them hip hop cop cars
68 rare chrome these go knock off they know who it is
High as the ceiling, mind on a million

Then run the old heist again while them suckers ain't looking
What's for the taking has just been tooken

Regulating for the paper while y'all pocket watching
