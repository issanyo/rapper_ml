[Verse 1]
Poolside, too high with three bitches for four nights
I'm finna dip, be outty 5 in that 600 Benz or that 750i
Ate 9 slices of that humble pie
But you know I still talk my shit, right?
What your tryna hear when you high?
What you wish they played on the radio at least one time?
It's cool though! We getting major paper on the underground
You thought it was them other fools, though it was us the whole time
Them haters tryna deplete my shine like Venetian blinds
But son do what the sun do: rise
Hit the game like a Pi√±ata, tryna get a prize
Outta riding, got me my bottom bitch, she give me the best top
A sex pistol getting shotgun in the drop
Best to wear your mittens, baby girl, cause I got

[Hook]
My top down, bitch in a bikini
My weed loud, I know you hear it screaming
I'm here now, what's going on this evening
You could look the other way but I know you see me
I know you see it, I know you see it
I know you see it, nigga, I know you see it
I know you see it, I know you see it
You could look the other way, but I know you see it

[Verse 2]
Courtside, a few drinks
Cussing at the referee, his officiating stinks
Spitta Andretti, I'm money on wheels
Like a Brink truck weight tough, nigga never budge
I'm a sphinx, what? Marvel at my stance
Ask your girl what she think, she can't even respond
Cause her mind is now mine fool, I ain't lying
'less it's cross the couch, sleeping with my shoes on
Just in case I have to wake up and be out, once again it's on
Mama bring my bong to the gameroom with nothing but some panties on
And them Bape socks that I gave you
Never once on probation but your man's on his papers, spending them
Stacking them, filling them, wrapping them, lighting them, never passing them
I rolled it up myself and I don't remember your help
That's how we do it now, fall through the Jetset manor
Bring your own ounce, this is new Jet City, baby girl, rub yo titties

[Hook]
