[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Aw man
Fresh Veggies
Aw yeah
Rockie Fresh, Millionaire Veggies
Aw man, damn, damn

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner

[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Damn dog have you seen her?
She was driving in the Kia
Upgraded to a Bimmer
Make it flood, she need FEMA
Niggas hating, acting like some [?]
I'ma stunt when I see her
Roll a blunt when I see her
Twice a month when I see her
Damn dog she a keeper
Got it on lock so they gotta free her
Niggas hating on me, swear to God all these boys need Jesus
Came through [?] had to say RIP to Aaliyah
One nigga won't work so the whole squad had to go team up
Came through, they was sleeping on me now I'm living everything they dreamed of

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
Girl how you doing? It's real nice to meet you
The way that you looking it's hard not to see you
Pulled up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Lil mama bad and I like her demeanor
I love 'em, I love 'em but no I don't need 'em
Getting this money, don't got time to see 'em
I got her number, yeah that part was easy
Next thing you know man she [?]
[?]
Girl we could [?] trip to Abiza
And she riding with me
Every time I go she's like "Baby, don't leave"
I might pour a four in a liter
Baby I'm so fly I shop out arenas
And the top is receding
I copped the Coup but the Audi was cleaner

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I got her number, yeah that part was easy
I dropped a location, I told her to meet me
I [?] when she see me
I made a scene trying to keep [?] secret
[?] so I just leave it
If you had one then you probably couldn't keep it
Them niggas around you would probably eat ya
Thought you was cool they showed you [?]
Bitches was looking, they peeped it
They don't believe you when you claim that [?] shit
Hopped in my '63 and I hit the switch
You ain't gotta guess who she leaving with

[Chorus: Casey Veggies]
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner
Pull up in the Audi and I got the Bimmer
Baby girl bad and I like her demeanor
Baby girl bad and she holding the nina
Kicked my ass to the curb, shawty was meaner
