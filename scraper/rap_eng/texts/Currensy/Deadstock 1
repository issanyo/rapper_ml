[Intro]

La Musica de Harry Fraud

Jet Life
Eastside
Cruise Life every time

[verse]

Look how shit get when you not lookin’
Your number one spot get took’n
‘posed to be all, you got duped like a rookie

And everybody was looking at the game
They saw how sloppy you was playin
And they labeled you a lame

And you keep telling yourself “fuck what errybody think,”
But if they don’t bang your music homie you don’t make bank

Is a couple homies who stayed trill and maintained
Made a million dollars and never changed
And with them I pop champagne

Is only a few of us stayed trill and papered up
Vintage Bape and stuff
On stage and such
Rare Flows as deadstock Airs
Get em in pairs
Dunk contest, jumped over Shaq
Standing on a chair

You bitches wasn’t there
When I was shooting in the gym
We the champs, cut the nets down from the rim when we win

Yeah that’s them:
Rolls Royce, followed by the Benz
Followed by the Porsche followed by the Beemer

Yeah, we all eatin
Bitches, I like having them around but I don’t really need em
Half the time I’m stoned actin like I don’t even see them

Money on the agenda, what we got this evenin?
Money is the reason this is Andretti season

Never Ending Story
Big dog fly as fuck
And them haters got nothing for me

Been in this. One of the coolest
My presence is an influence
Come through and show them rap stars how to really do it

I cruise Chevys down the streets that they is not in tune with
Jet Life still is a monumental movement

Stacking paper. Making lifestyle music
Smoking loud drowning out all them niggas bullshit

Eastside

Jet Life

[outro]

Keep the key in it
Chevys on switches nigga
Smokin weed in it

Wouldn’t talk about it
If niggas didn’t live it
If you need to see it
You can come and visit
If you don’t believe me
Then ask one of your bitches
If she bad, she probly kick it nigga
Keep the key in it
Chevy on switches
La-da-da-da da-da
That’s cool
