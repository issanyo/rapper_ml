(Chorus)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire

[Verse 1 Celeb Forever]
Yeah, okay
Welcome to the side where the grass is always greener
And the women always naked
I swear life is what you make it
Niggas be making plans, Tony Tiger Frosted Flakin'
Man I'm moving in the game
Man the money is adjacent
Smokin' on good, artificial flavoring
AK 47, new gun fragrance
I'm on it, if you with it
She driving, I'm twisting
Aston Martin double-park it that a cop give me a ticket
Niggas is feeling froggy, kill you over a ribbit
I chop a nigga in half so technically he a midget
Never that Reggie Miller, got trees like it's Christmas
Watch: yellow diamonds, he's like a Simpson
Pull out my thing, let her teethe like an infant
We don't smoke the same, Boy my G's too expensive
I tell her puff puff
I fuck a chick laying down, trying to cum up
Hoes down, blunts up, man

(Chorus)
You make me feel alive (put ya, put ya, man, uh, now put ya)
You are my high desire (now put ya, now put ya lighters up, now put ya, now put ya, now put ya lighters up)
You make me feel alive (put ya lighters up, put ya lighters up, put ya, yeah, gone)
You are my high desire (put ya lighters up, yeah)

[Verse 2 Curren$y]
By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the buliding on my Batman shit
Nigga suspended from the ceiling
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling
Gondola rides in Venice
Mama you got the vision and see it HD and it couldn't be any clearer
You should be with Spitta and you know it, it's your chance
Don't blow it like birthday candles
Good guy, Spitta, keep his name out of them scandals
Now the secret: I prefer my girl in sneakers, never sandals
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals
Bottles pop, back to back, extra large chronic sack, cell phone camera snaps
Mama I remember that, anytime I look at that
I go to wondering where you at
So baby where you at wit it?
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
And maybe if we get back up in a minute (yeauh)

(now put ya lighters up, put ya, yeah, put ya lighters up... ay pass me that blunt right there.)

(Chorus x2)
You make me feel alive (uh, now put ya)
You are my high desire (put ya lighters up, put ya lighters up)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
You make me feel alive (I swear they don't be smokin' like us man)
You are my high desire (and I don't even used to do this shit but...)
You make me feel alive
You are my high desire
