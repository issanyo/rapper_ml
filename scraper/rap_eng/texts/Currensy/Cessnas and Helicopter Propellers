[Hook]
Single engine Cessnas and helicopter propellers
Went through a storm together
We swore to ball together
She say she down for whatever
She say she down for forever

[Verse 1]
Said she'd always be with me on a mission for the cheddar
I promise not to forget her and show her the finer weather
We could go anywhere that's what you fucking with a jet fo'
On my levels I'm desperate, its stressful to be successful
Focused on the checks I'm always thinking about my next goal
Burning petro 93 unleaded, nothing less than jet smoke
I had that bitch butt naked, Biscayne Bay my cigarette boats
Living like its the eighties and I'm a cocaine professional
Musical dope, moving snow when the speakers blow
We were scrambling for sneaker dough
Now we buying bigger homes when the deals close
We were scrambling for sneaker dough
Now we hopping out slamming Cadillac doors

[Hook]
Single engine Cessnas and helicopter propellers
Went through a storm together
We swore to ball together
She say she down for whatever
She say she down for forever
But then we got confused I though we would never say
Somewhere we got confused I though we never would say never

[Verse 2]
Somewhere we got confused I thought we never would say never
Never turned to never should we see each other ever again
I got money to get and you knew that when I started this
My main target always been increasing my profit margin
Downtown warehouse, my exotic car storage
Maneuvering in something foreign
Had a translator when I bought it
Though I could have let my diamonds talk for me
My girl like when I wear that shit, looking all player-ish
I wrote this song facing it
I ain't selfish but I'm about myself
Long as you chill I provide help
Count on that like you cont on a stack
I could show you like a map, I could pull up like a phone app
Right where your home at
Mickey and Mallory, its not about a salary its all about reality
Smoking with my bad bitch who brung a bag a cash to me
Staying cool avoid casualties

Single engine Cessnas and helicopter propellers
Went through a storm together
We swore to ball together

Single engine Cessnas and helicopter propellers
Went through a storm together
We swore to ball together
She say she down for whatever
She say she down for forever

Single engine Cessnas and helicopter propellers
Went through a storm together
We swore to ball together
She say she down for whatever
She say she down for forever
But then we got confused I though we would never say
Somewhere we got confused I though we never would say never
Somewhere we got confused I thought we never would say never
Never turned to never should we see each other ever again
I got money to get and you knew that when I started this
