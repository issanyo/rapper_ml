[Hook: Dee Low]
Good weed and broads, spaceships and stars
Roll out the red carpet but hold the applause

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
New Orleans and narcotics draped in metal and fiber optics
Cause dull bitches attracted to shiny objects
Well I guess y'all can kick it, Phife Dawg
Q-Tip, we all Souls of Mischief
This is how we chill until the globe stop spinning
I told all my folks that I'd be coming back with it
Now ask 'em if I did it any different, peppermints and lemons
Boss brothers chopping business around the table
It resembles a civil rights sit-in
Powerful shit, editing rooms, hours of clips
A man of many hats in this new era
Nurturing several smaller business underneath my umbrella
On the low low

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And I'm still on top of the money
Dope boy mattress, a hundred K cash
With the box spring under it, who they think they fucking with
Spitta won't have none of it, suits offer contracts
I tear that shit up in front of them, baby girl I'm just hustling
Without cocaine smuggling but this shit is dope Tito
Roll these as we smoke, joints infinity
Highed up, supposed to have breakfast at Tiffany's
With Brittany but I got tied up, low riders
Hydraulics, trunks full of batteries and wires
Flow get tighter and tighter, adjustable pliers
Flip through these bitches like Zippo lighters

[Hook]
