[Chorus]
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is

[Verse 1]
Lames listening to lyin', I'm scrambling for mine
Every yard count, touchdown hoe, gimme mine
I shine because I put in time
Rolexes I done copped 8 or 9
But my Plain Jane Datejust I really like
Got the bust down 41-millimeter crazy ice
Vegas lights, crazy nights, paid a hefty price
Caught them hoes eyes but my girl was with me, I was occupied Bitch you'll have to try to shoot your shot some other night
Was always fly but wasn't always rich, I grinded for this
A underground nigga spending mainstream chips
Money flip, stack, acrobat, driveway like a dealership
Historical shit, spaceship, miracle whip

[Outro]
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
Yea we is
Chances make champions
You gotta risk it all to win it all
You gotta risk it all to win it all, we gambling yea we is
Chances make champions
Yea we them
