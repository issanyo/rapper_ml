[Verse 1]
I wasn't rich from the beginning see I had to get it
No tint up on my windows hoe you see me in here
Straight winner turn these rappers out here into dinner
Get some grub with ya Soul Food my niggas
I drove through and I killed 'em
Had the rear mounted engine on the Ferrari with the dishes
These cars I always mention
'Cause you really see me in 'em
See first I smoke and envision it
And then I hustle and get the shit

[Chorus](x2)
Some of my people gotta hustle just to pay the rent
Some of us not in the position that we say we in
Can't have no bill collectors coming to my residence
That's why everyday I be running for them presidents

[Verse 2]
Juvie gave me the game a long time ago
So every now and then I slide past his spot to smoke
I got patnas sold a lot of dope and this I know
Some of 'em chilled out some of 'em still out there though
What I'm gon' knock 'em for, know it's all about the dough
It's a survival thing in time I hope I could provide a lane
In time I hope I could provide some change
Show 'em a way to rise up and get paid
A slice of the layer cake, one is all it take
Show 'em a way to rise up and get paid
A slice of the layer cake, one is all it take

[Chorus](x2)
Some of my people gotta hustle just to pay the rent
Some of us not in the position that we say we in
Can't have no bill collectors coming to my residence
That's why everyday I be running for them presidents

[Outro]
You making shit more complicated than it should be
You feel your chance is coming soon and it could be
You making shit more complicated than it should be
You feel your chance is coming soon and it could be
Yup
