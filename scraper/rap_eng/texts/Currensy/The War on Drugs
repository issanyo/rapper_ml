[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Sharper than my nephew's edge up
Bitches tryna be under the Don so they step up
Apply to ride with your highness
Only the best of the bunch, pick of the litter
The prized pup grew to be a big dog
This ain't new to me, seen it through my homies eyes, true OG's
Now I ride them pretty cars down gruesome streets
Dead partners in my ear reminding me what these jealous niggas will do to me
So I can never sleep
Light power nap, three hour flight, collect them stacks
We keep it moving we, can't stop, brake lines pop
Headlines made, front page
I rock sweatpants on any occas', baby, why not
Make a bop out of your lady, silencer from a potato
OG Bobby Johnson now I live like Ox, son
Big ass house son, weed in the bowl, I'm on the couch son
With my homeboy in route, son
So assassination attempts will yield a different outcome
I don't even really be 'bout none
But my brothers watching son, so watch it son

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
They say wake up and smell the Folgers
But I'm from the hood, when I wake up I smell yola
Now my girl want me back
Bitch I tried to told you that one day I get this dough
But she thought that I was bogus
Said I'm acting funny since she get the cold shoulder
Like I don't know her
Shit, Rod' a grown man, I'm no doja
They label me a fo' nick totter, a marijuana smoker
Who hardly ever sober I stay highed up, loaded
Uh, let's get this money that's what my uncle taught me, yea
I stand for something, now where your guts and glory, yea
And I'm no baby boy, Roddy no Jody
I got real nigga status fool, I bet your lady know me
I'm killing these cowards tell them haters die slowly
They hate to see me up and see me ball like Gin√≥bili
They'd rather see me injured on the side like Kobe
But it's crunch time I gotta get mine, them pussies owe me, nigga

[Hook x4]
Amongst the thunder and clouds, we breaks it down
Moving in silence, but them actions speak loud
They try to Xerox the flows, we switch our style
