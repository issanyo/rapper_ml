[Hook X2]
And then the Gs walked in and everything froze
You in a room full of players trying to hide your hoes
Money on my mind sticking to the code
She see me getting mine can't help it if she chose

[Verse]
Ain't right game tight
Plotted maneuvered executing the same night
No room for hesitation excuses in this life
This money don't wait I get to it all night
In the studio cooking shows steady booking
Bought a new car paid for it with this jugging
It cost to be the boss, tall price
Some niggas too scared of heights
I climbed swan dived behind mine and anytime
Grinded for them rollies now all the top jewelers know me
Mr. Cop a show piece, 40 bands just on a band my man
Hot hands frozen fingers pinkies on ice like Disney
Figure skaters on my bracelet getting dizzy
Picture me sitting fuck that
Picture me getting
Picture me whipping in Ferrari shifting on the pacific
Smoking something exotic and terrific
Life like this only comes with a risk
Money and the power and a bad bitch
Living like I've been selling powder my nigga mad bricks
This ain't nothing but that audio dope boy magic yea
