[Intro]
Yeah
70's movie shit
Jump in the cab, tell 'em yo follow that car right there

Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Eastside
Uh

[Hook]
Durag on my waves, money on my mind
We pull out new things in the summertime
One by one in a line and they all shine
One by one in a line and they all mine

[Verse]
Standing in my driveway I'm trying to decide
Which one to drive this shit always take me so much time
Convertible or the hardtop coupe
Starlit ceiling or maybe a sunroof
I done spent loot on this from the minute that I got in it
Rim it up but I never tint 'em
Paid out, don't lease or rent 'em
I own it if you seen me in it
That's word to my homie Fendi
Roll down the window and tell that bitch she need to get with it
Its scratch, we can't be missing

[Hook](x3)
Durag on my waves, money on my mind
We pull out new things in the summertime
One by one in a line then they all shine
One by one in a line and they all mine

[Outro]
None of this was given this was all grind
