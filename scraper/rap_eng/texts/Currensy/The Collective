Da-Da-Da Da-Da
As The Joint Burns, and the wheels turn, (yea)

And i never that i would have one

(Talking)

Interstate ? * Interstate Hound, Forgiatto Wheels, Cadillac Grille
Bumpin my nigga Big Krit
Coming Down Smelling like Bond no. 9 and a half a pound
That's What I Do, I thought you knew
You've been informed, you been warned
Its up to you, whoever fit the shoe
Still a Chevy man through and through
But its something about that El Dorado coupe
And the way she moves
Baby blue my latest boo, lowriders yea i gotta few
But its just something different, you gotta sit in it
Custom machine im steering
Making that real (ryda?) *Make every arrival a grand appearance
Smoking some fire right outside the building
Chopping the game up for these ghetto children
Cold chillin, flowing like a polo linen


And i never ever thought i would get a Cadillac

Haven't driven the Rolls since some days
I been Cadillacin' bumpin that UGK
Smoking gas in a real major way
On Wheels The Collective we been making plays
Legal trappin made it rich from rappin
My life the shit I had to just go and tell u how it happen
Over these beats, i know you hear them snares gettin at u
Like the rat-a-tat of assault rifles from project battles
Im sliding past u in a blast from the past, like super fast
Interior beyond cold, i swear to god its laid out like a condo
Im a let that one ?  bro

And i never ever thought I'd get a Cadillac
But im highered up dippin in the Cadillac
Smokin one for my nigga big krit in the Cadillac
Eastside on the rise, keep the E in it, nigga we smoking weed in it
Laughing in the pictures, wouldn't write about it if a nigga didn't live it
Yea thats the difference. yall act like some bitches
