[Intro]
Yeah, turn it up a little bit
I remember this from the beginning of Menace II Society
I started wearing my socks high after that too

Spitta that nigga rap slow live fast
Six fo with the switch box under the dash
327 rat underneath the hood
Got it growling like something need to be in the woods
Just dipping through the city where the choppas fire
Young niggas on the set like they filming the wire
Seen my homeboy Dip last month got hit
With a shotgun blast but he survived the shit
Bitches talkin bout Spitta say the nigga so clean
I swear he got chlorine in his veins
Made my low low lean like it sip codeine
Executive suggest that Spitta better switch up his flow for the cheese
I don't comply and complain
They try to tempt me but I restrain
Refuse to compromise, I won't change
Like I vow to forever where the same thing, yeah
