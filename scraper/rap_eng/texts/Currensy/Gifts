[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Boss is how we prone to think
Communicate with killers via CorrLinks
Some of my niggas went from the corner to the coroner
I made it out, luxury bus, touring love
Right
Feeling better than head on the wake up
Roll me up a balmer like, it's great stuff
Won a couple dollars off the Knicks vs Pacers
I'm raged up
Already a better day than Ice Cube had
That's word to Terrance Howard doo rag
All my life I been a cool cat
Word
Hop out the 7 in some Ewings
You looking bad in that bullshit you in
I speak ebonics and Ben Franklin fluent
Every boss once was the best student
Been hustling since a truant
I'm a top tier nigga
L seven you a fucking square nigga
We could never square with ya
DZA

[Hook: Smoke DZA and Manchild]
(Playing good music)
Real niggas better get right
And be fuckin with the jet life
(Is our gift to you)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yeah bitch
They gotta weigh it on the scale they weigh the whales with
One sniff will make a german shepherd back flip
Three small gold chains, two pinky rings
And one big fucking dream to own all this
Empire under construction
Hard hat zone, work going on
Hazardous habitats, we hustling, but fuck it holmes
Bastards is rabid at them cash stacks
Bitches is going bad for that
Put you on like socks
Put you on like my watch
Put you up like a poster
Lucky motherfuckers getting game from the coaches
And didn't even know it
The last stoned poets
Who never sold their souls and still in motion
Raking that dough in
And you silly motherfuckers thought it's just bout smoking
Shit

[Hook: Smoke DZA and Manchild]
(Playing good music)
Real niggas better get right
And be fuckin with the jet life
(Is our gift to you)

[Outro: Manchild]
We sing a song
Especially for you
