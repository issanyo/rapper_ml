[Intro]
Yeaahh...
{?}
I slow my pride, push the bullshit aside

[Chorus: Cozz]
Baby I'm sittin' high
Make sure that my fans survive
I got a plan to thank God
I'm really feelin' blessed now
I close my hands to thank God
Close my eyes, slow my pride, I don't mind
I don't mind

[Verse 1: Cozz]
Yeah a nigga back, I ain't done yet baby
I ain't stoppin' till I'm ballin' like an upset baby
If I fall then I'm crawlin', then I'm straight back to the walkin'
You niggas talkin' like stoppin' really ever was an option
Always was an artist, how I put together my garments
Hustle 200 dollars, spend it all at the Slauson
They still was callin' them flawless
Don't matter how much it's costin'
You can shop at a Target and rock it like it's Versace
'Cause you can buy clothes, you can hire a stylist
But you can't buy sauce, can't even make a deposit
Either don't got it or you got it
Had it before my pockets had anything deep inside it
But that's ok, now I'm whippin', my engine foreign, my windows is tinted
Dippin' in women that's with it, bills and my gas is expensive
Don't you go ever forget it, pray for it that's why I get
Fuck all the fame and the bitches, just making sure that we livin'

[Chorus: Cozz]
Baby I'm sittin' high
Make sure that my fans survive
I got a plan to thank God
I'm really feelin' blessed now
I close my hands to thank God
Close my eyes, slow my pride, I don't mind
I don't mind

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I smoke and pray at the same time
Hopin' God don't mind, the fact that I'm high
I'm sure he know I'm speakin' through my clearest mind
Hoes enticed by what I drive
She said that she respect my grind, I know she lyin'
She just been researchin' and schemin' online
Underground bosses with mainstream shine
This here 'bout rhymes, we just preservin' the game, or at least we tryin'
My Ferrari caught my younger homie eyes
Quicker than his teachers could pull him aside to guide
I guess the responsibility is mine
Or is I's, Andretti and Cozz
Cold champagne bottles for reluctant role-models
You can follow if you can keep up with my Impala
Leadership qualities, lavender and violet, while a bitch complete my cypher properly
I gotta keep a bad one in the ride with me
Got a bitch who known for totin' pistols right along side of me
Keepin' an eye on all these niggas who say they'll die for me

[Chorus: Cozz]
Baby I'm sittin' high
Make sure that my fans survive
I got a plan to thank God
I'm really feelin' blessed now
I close my hands to thank God
Close my eyes, slow my pride, I don't mind
I don't mind

[Outro: Curren$y]
Got a bitch who known for totin' pistols right along side of me
Keepin' an eye on all these niggas who say they'll die for me
Got a bitch who known for totin' pistols right along side of me
Keepin' an eye on all these niggas who say they'll die for me
