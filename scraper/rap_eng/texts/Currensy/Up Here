[Verse 1: Curren$y]

Niggas know, the lyrical molesting has taken place
Second guess and spit, vicious ainâ€™t safe
Concetrated on the album fell back from the tapes
Soon as this is done it's back to square 1
It's the return of the real life live nigga no tint
Ride fly, Don't hide
Record label meetings I'm high in 'em
Got a nigga stressed
They don't want to cut the check
'less they they feel they'll get a major ???
Try to put me in a house nigga suit
So they could present me to the press
But I built my own house and you're an unwelcome guest
My heart, my mind is where I hit my wealth first
My pocket and my bank account came next
C6 'vettes, G-5 jets, 20K bets, while you niggas still in debt
Wondering what I'm doing why haven't I dropped yet
I'm on your bitches mind and a haters neck

[Hook - Curren$y]

I can't see you niggas from up here
And I can't hear you niggas from up here
So I ain't too concerned you're doing down there
Cuz it's that sucka shit and I'll not allow it around here

[Verse 2: Curren$y]

When the wheels touch down
You know the jets are in town
Smoking from the personal pound
I leave ground still high after the plane land
Your bitch with me,you left us 17 voice mails
Nigga daaamn
You're myspaceing and facebooking, looking for your girl
To no avail , she's been tooken
Spitta and that jet music what she get used to
Can't beat us, can't join us neither
We dont need ya, got the eye's on the prize my nigga
We dont see ya,niggas starving for attention
So they throwin' bait to the sky fly fishin'
I ain't trippin cuz them separatists ain't even in a nigga division
This is real rap, them niggas is real whack
I'm standing in the customer service return line
With my microphone, trying to bring hip hop back

[Hook - Curren$y]

I can't see you niggas from up here
And I can't hear you niggas from up here
So I ain't too concerned what you're doing down there
Cuz it's that sucka shit and I'll not allow it around here

[Third Verse: Young Roddy]

Since the clock don't stop I'm getting money in the rush
All the shit that I heard, I kept it on the hush
And I'm fly as fuck, I don't need no kush
Just smelling like purple haze mixed with the million bucks
And mamma told me: hold it down,she doesn't ask for much
So I'm on my gefferson shit, im movin up
And my Texas homie told me that in a year they'll screw me up
And never will I ever touch girl without guts
Real niggas call it skills and fake niggas call it luck
So most niggas pay vaginas, so most niggas get fucked
And I still run the city like a RTA bus
But I'm still hard to find like a diamond in the rough
Yeah a trendsetter so they copy how I do mine
And nigga switch to this hustle when I got a new grind
We keep jars of kush, no grey poupon
And circle locked and safe, nah, we dont need no new guys

[Hook - Curren$y]
