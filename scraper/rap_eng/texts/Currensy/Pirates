[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I ride around in my Rolls wearing a Rollie you roll
Basketball shorts, 3 cones and both of my phones
I'm waiting on real niggas to call
Closing on my home
A little spot to park cars, like that fucking bong
I'm smoking that Cali strong, never leave it alone
I got love for that place, sure as my Daytons is chrome
As I look over the game, I see where it's going wrong
We letting too much slide, royals neglecting the throne
Essence is stepping upon, radio lettin' em'
Children is singing along, brainwashed coming up
They whole perception is thrown, as to what the game really is
Too many suckas getting away with that silly shit
Pink champagne let my pinky ring lift
Extend as I sip, diamonds spring marvelous
Ballin' with the hunger of a starving artist
It's hard to sleep on the sound of that money calling
I'm rolling the dice, controlling the price
Manufacture and distribute all in one night
Shots called by the one that you gotta see
Piano Man, gold fingers, musical keys
They all come to me, they all come to me
Music by the key
My weed instrumentals
