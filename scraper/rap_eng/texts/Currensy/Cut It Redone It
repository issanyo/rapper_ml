[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Phantom pull up like a pamper
Bitch I ain't pull up I landed
Boy I'm so fly I can't stand it
They say I'm not from this planet
I run a show single handed
Fifty grand rubber banded
Paper chasing never scrambling
Talking money never rambling
This is all about advancement
Pretty Chevrolet is dancing
Do it like I know magic
Bitch I been a pro at it
Couple hits for your cataracts
Cadillacs is outback, the mansion
Get a glance at what a nigga stacking
Never that my brother and them will clap you
Fuck it, seen the sixty eight droptop at the junkyard
Drug it, over to my shop to give it a new start
You know we, gut it, we cut it, redone it
Now we Canal Street stunting
My mind right and my money right so y'all niggas can't tell me nothing

[Hook: Curren$y]
Cut it
Done it

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
I stuff OG in the kingsize
I hit the bitch in the kingsize
I had the bitch sitting ringside
Head so good ask the bitch what's her ring size
We trade the foreigns for bowties
I trade Chanel for a blowjob
You worrying about me whats your hoe's job
I'm scratching off in the parking lot
Like fuck it
Arm out the window on my celly
I don't serve them niggas they be telling
Had them bitches in and out my telly
Towel under the door you smell it
Pack was bad still sell it
Run it up and fuck it up
I just matted out my truck
I'm fucking her and fucking her
A lot of money ain't enough
I'm tryna stack the bricks and pull up
I just copped a drank and pour up
Sneak diss at me I pull up
I ride the Jeep with the doors off
I'm with a bitch she don't wear drawers
I hit a dab then I dozed off
On a jet checking my son report card
They don't like me in the game I'm a bogart
I live my life thtough sports cars
I park them all on my neighbors lawn
Niggas try to count me out now they paying for it
Before I hate on the boy I'll sign him
And then push his album back like a lineman
I be in the D more than the lions
If a deal ain't worth a mil I ain't signing

[Hook: Corner Boy P]
So cut it
So cut it
