We in the game for millions
Y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions
Y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions
We in the game for millions

[Verse 1]
I'm in the game for millions, homie I came with killers
You had to pay for them hitters that mean they not really with you
Ferrari's pull up on your sister 10 out of 10 I can get her
10 out of 10 we can flip her
But I was too busy to hit her
Spitta and 808 Mafia make 'em nervous
Riding and swervin' on purpose
Diamonds fittin' me perfect listen to the silver surfer
Free my dog we get to workin'
Wait bought that Wraith paper straight
Jet life on the plates
Hater fix your face, you too late
She's already here

[Hook]
We in the game for millions y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions, looking to gain some billions
Homie y'all ain't familiar
We in the game for millions y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions y'all in the game for bitches
We in the game for millions, looking to gain some billions
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Smoke the night away park the 68
Behind iron gates mansion where I stay
Everything is laid out these days
But you know it didn't start that way
Got it out the mud audio drugs
Underground plug came up got paid
Snatched them niggas cake
They more focused on hoes than bringing that dough in
That's why we kicked the door in
Dug the safe up and some more shit fuck the hoe shit
Where the dough is, know we goin'
We be outta town in the mornin'
We got passports we got Porsches
We got Rovers by the fortress
We got castles to lay low in
Weren't no hassle we in motion
They ask what I did it for they ask how I get that far
Wonder how I got that car, wanna know if narcotics involved
Have you ever seen spiders scratch jaws
When the fire shoot out the exhaust
I'm on the phone with my lil dawgs
[?] Say when he get out he gon' ball
