[Verse: Curren$y]
Higher
Than 30,000 feet
H-O-double the T
S-P-I-double T-A
What more can I say?
I B-E-S-O-F-L-Y
I know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, drive all the drops
And fuck every bitch that you ever jacked
I got big dog status and my dogs don't say a lot
And in my city I'm a factor
Nigga at the pizza parlor chilling in an Aston
People, passport, and at least three magnums
Fucking and traveling
Never really know what could happen
When times is crunch like captain
Wanna hear a flow thats way about average?
Just listen like DJ Khaled
Curren$y at Caesar's Palace
Ringside, fight night, cameras flashing
