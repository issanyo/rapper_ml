[Intro]
Always Rest In Peace to the legendary

[Verse 1]
She whippin my ride, countin out 1s and taking pictures
She wanna freeze the memory I'm just caught up in the livin
I handed out turkeys like Nino on Thanksgiving
Renovate it, rebuild it, created residence in em
I'm in the game it's all about dead presidents, isn't it?
And the one with the most at the end is the one who's winning
I valet my own lowrider at the lobster dinner
Ain't want them lil fuckers sittin it fuckin with my switches
Took my keys lock the shit and went in the building
Smokin killa with the killers
Cuttin deals with the dealers
Discussing wheels with the big wheelers
They try to play you like they jokin but they dead serious
Watch them niggas ain't even got a pop gun witcha
But you promotin them Ra-Ra lyrics
And now them Ra-Ra hittas is lookin to get witcha
Diggin in your pockets takin all your lint and your pennies
You can't keep up with the image scared to make a scheduled appearance cause
Niggas from that city talking bout kickin yo shit in again
Gold Benz, interior like butter Timbs
BBS rims, bitch who else but him? ha
