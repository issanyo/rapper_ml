[Intro]
Another saturday, sun goin down
Still bright enough for you to wipe your car off though
Find the car keys

[Verse 1]
On the low like a ground effects kit
20/20 for chronic in this bitch
Took my drivers seat out, put a throne in my shit
We street kings, concrete castles, penthouses is lavish
It was established I could have it when I met her, but
I ain't even gon' fuck
Just gon' bend a corners on a couple my homies
See what the gas man got for me
Light one at the light, as I got on the highway
Passenger occupied by pretty eyes half open
Cause she been smokin'
That girl so high, that girl on fire for a rider
Now she right on side one

[Chorus]
Cars with the boomin' system (8x)

[Verse 2]
S10 blazers, dancing beds
I used to draw em on my looseleaf papers
Now the proof is on the pavement
We made it we major
We turned people who used to be cool with us into haters
So? can't be scared to grow, they want you afraid to shine
Cause they too pussy to try
I'm paid cuz, I said do when you said die
I laid down log, paid dues, bend rules, never lie
Tony made what he could on the side
Never turned on you frank
Just tried to add a couple zeros to the bank
But you know how that went
Ambition to get tigers at the crib and all types of crazy shit

[Chorus]
