[Hook x2]
Bought it this morning, drive it like I stole it
Park it, left it running like I really don’t want it
We've been bending corners
Been like, bent like elbows, been being anywhere that cash go

[Verse]
Checking my mirror for them suckers
Coast clear, turn up that music, light another
This that mink coat flow, I wrote this in the summer
Poolside, high-school, you, motherfucker
To the rules we abide by on this side
Members-only like the jacket, I grew up amongst some criminals
Check their jackets, known for action with them ratchets
While I was just cooling, writing raps, eating snacks and shit
300 racks I spent just to sit in back and get higher than a mother
Looking down to them scrubs
How could you hate yo brother when I’m just like you?
Except I did what I said that I would do, erase the hate
And let the sun shine through
Apply yourself, fool, you can live out yo dreams, too
Imagination can create the truth
Every brick that built my mansion will provide the proof
Recognize he riding Bentleys when he coming, fool
Like a set of Forgiatos on the living room
Luxury shit, fuck with me, bitch
Capital G, the weather nice out, I’m hitting the switch
I’m in the streets, thirteen-inch, triple gold Ds
Strike a pose, a picture worth a thousand words, I suppose
Picture me rolling with yo golden, chosen who you thought would hold it
Down for ya but she clowned ya
You’re under pressure, so unprofessional
High beyond measure, sharing her treasure with my fellows
Oh she down for the jets, bro, no tricking, no financial
Strictly finesse, bruh, onto to the next, bruh
Find her where I left her

[Hook x2]

[Outro: The Godfather 1]
Sollozzo: I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in cash. I need those politicians that you carry in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes
Don Corleone: I said that I would see you because I heard that you were a serious man, to be treated with respect. But I must say no to you and let me give you my reasons
