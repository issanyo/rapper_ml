[Hook: Rich The Kid]
She nervous
In the Benz, still swerving
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving
She nervous
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yo bitch, all under pressure
Yo bitch, in her drawers on my leather
Yo bitch, in my crib half naked
But my girl coming so she got to dip this second
Shit wild, lifestyle, girls fast
Cars loud, smoking gas
Evergreen trees, chopped down, top down
Hoes say I’m cool ‘cause my name hot now
People like them arm clown but I’m underground
Soul intact, nigga that’s real rap
My nigga Rich sent this, I sent it right back
With a couple more bricks attached

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
She nervous
In the Benz, still swerving
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving
She nervous
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I got your bitch with them bricks and she nervous
Put that ho right on the block, now she serving
Thick ass, I’ma hit her, flip her like a stripper
Bitches bustin’, I’ma pass her to my nigga Spitter
Why you mad ‘cause I pull up in that coupe now
Killin’ niggas, I’ma have to let the truth out
I told her pop that pussy like a pimple
I got plenty colors in my diamonds like some Skittles
Swerving the Benz, ‘Sace my lens, flexing again
More clips for the F&N, shooters spray like Taliban
Roll with the chopper, she nervous
Got good dope in that Birken
Bad bitch she working
Get rich or die, no Curtis

[Hook: Rich The Kid]
She nervous
In the Benz, still swerving
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving
She nervous
Shawty taking trips with them things in her blouse
Is you nervous?
Cause I’m flexing on purpose
Young nigga, I’m sipping and swerving
