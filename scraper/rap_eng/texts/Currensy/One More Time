Stones, stoned
Immaculate
Stoned
Jet life, jet life, jet life

Lo sweaters & better, bitch bring it on
Stacked enough cheddar to change the weather love, where we goin'?
Land into them coupes with the fine leather, 6 figure gas pedals
I got these broads under pressure, cause they been knowin'
See that nigga there? Year after year he top scorin'
How you want it? Them leers or them 7-87 boeings?
Wutchu doin'? Them roadsters tourin' editions with the tops on 'em
One thing's fo' sho, them J.L.R. boys be quick to drop on 'em
No hot soup for em', without warnin'
Either a nigga hella high, touchin' the clouds or the sky fallin'
I do this for my league money niggas and my home boys who not ballin'
Trill bitches know that I keep me a fifty tucked in my sock for em'
Roll up, hot box the Caprice out, make the block fog
Let 'em out, get back on my paper route, stack house
Keep that shit bumpin' like a drive-through crack house
Rap hustlin' she wait for em', to come inside, so I could smash out

Love,roll the weed up, let your head down, shut the blinds
Cut the music up, wait, turn around one more, turn
Wait, turn around one more, turn
Let your head down, shut the blinds
Wait, turn around one more, turn
Put your head down, shut the blinds
Couple years ago one, turn around
Put your head down, shut the blinds
Couple years ago wait, turn around, one more time
Wait up, let your head down, shut the blinds
Cut the music up, wait, turn around one more time

Roll the weed up, let your hair down, shut the blinds
Cut the music up, wait, turn around one more time
Love

Roll the weed up, let your hair down, shut the blinds
Cut the music up, wait, turn around one more time
Love

Jet life, jet life
Love
Jet life, jet life
Love

Shut the blinds
One more time
