[Intro]
Checking on that paper is my only concern
Checking on that fetti is my only concern
It's my only concern, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Gold Dana's on the ice cream truck
Pull up in that motherfucker like Big Worm
Checking on the scratch is my only concern
Checking on this paper is my only concern, yeah
Pulled up in my lowrider
Hit the switch lay my Chevy down like Big Worm
Nigga checking on the scratch is my only concern
I said checking on this paper is my only concern
It's my only concern, it's my only concern
Bitch, checking on the scratch is my only concern
Nigga checking on this paper is my only concern
Hoe checking on a scratch is my only concern

[Verse]
Five chains on my BBC tee, look at me
I'm stunting effortlessly, peppering season on beef
A veteran in the industry known for keeping it G
Chevy clean on D's, yea probably be
Spitta hitting switches rolling with a OZ
High grade only, smoking under palm trees
Plotted on taking the block, purchasing stocks
Stacked and still splurged on a watch, fuck it why not
You always in your house nigga we out
Looking for paper, bitch what's that bout
Nigga smoother than silk, slick as a perm, money to burn
Get mine jump back in the line and take your turn, yea

[Chorus]
Gold Dayton's on the ice cream truck
Pull up in that motherfucker like Big Worm
Checking on the scratch is my only concern
Checking on this paper is my only concern
Pulled up in my lowrider
Hit the switch lay my Chevy down like Big Worm
Checking on the scratch is my only concern
Checking on this paper is my only concern
It's my only concern, it's my only concern
Nigga checking on this money is my only concern
Bitch checking on this paper is my only concern
Hoe checking on the scratch is my only concern

[Outro]
Nah that's it that's it
Parking lot music
This that shit you wish they played in the club but they don't
You gotta play it in the parking lot
When the hoes walking out
When you doing your stunt laps
All in front the club, 2 miles per hour
Windows cracked, seeing what you could see
Being seen, yea I know, I know, aight
