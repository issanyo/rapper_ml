[Intro]
Never half ass, only get the dopest from me
Rollin with the homie Ski
My dog Fatts, LBC

[Verse]
Even if the pot was to drop and break
Fiends'll still pay top dollar for the shake flakes
They could scrape
Eating off these fine rhymes, like china plates
Instrumentals in my Bentley on the interstate
Millionares relate, cause I talk money
My niggas on the grind say I talk for em
Using this art as a talk forum
To spark notions, to start motion
Hope for the hopeless
Ain't know it when I wrote it
But my lines saved a man life
When I met him he told me
In a meet and greet line with a jernt
Him and his girl rolled for me
Thats why I keep going G, totally
Never half ass, only get the dopest from me
Rolling with the homie Ski
Smoking that spoken warrior tree
Green leaves, frosty with THC
Produce mo', Studio Judo
Sell out shows to cop mo' Chevy 2 Do's
Build another house just for me to park those
This is Curren$y in muthafuckin' boss mode
Currently running that Pilot Talk code
Now raise your glasses if you want mo'
We in the house like your closet door
I'm in yo bitch like a spinal chord
All up her back nigga, you don't like that
But she love it, thats why she does it
Never displaying affection when we out in public
Cause muthafuckas looking, and shit'll look ugly
So walk right past me homegirl, and do not say nuttin'
Secret locations we meet at, and then we cuttin'
Money discussions, when my bottom
Momma pack twin Louis Vuitton duffles
We coming up, with another plan to get it
Make sure the truck big enough to load all the cash in it
Ferrari's 40 yard dashing
Vanishing, behind gated mansion's
Smoking to the fact we always know that we would have it
It's turning out greater than we even had imagined
Bored with some luxuries, I never thought I'd haven't
Im just happy that when i see my momma she laughing
Stashing more weight, just in case she asks me
But she'll never need it cause she'll already have it
All of this coming from rapping bout
Last night action, last night madness
These other rappers is not even challenging
Or raising the bar
They sneaking under it or trying to crawl past it
We trying make classics here
Throw that other shit in the trash its weird

My dog Fatts
