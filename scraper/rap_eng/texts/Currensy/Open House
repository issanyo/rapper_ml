My bathtub lift up my walls do a 360
Hot Spitta visionary from the crescent city
Wallabee clarks blowing cream crispy
Shout out to Tony Starks you influenced me immensely
Niggas tried to rob me out my place in history
Thats why its meant for me to put these mini me's out of they misery
Barking mindy nikes bmx bikes
Grown child big kid this is my life
I went left and it seems that decision was right
Cuz my buzz so loud you can hear it in your sleep at night
It ain't even been a month yet
Mutha-fuckin niggas is back J-E-Ts
Curren$y Da Hot Spitta spread love every four weeks
Still hotter than poppa bears porridge
Still got the 63' drop top in storage
I'mma pull it out when the weather get gorgeous
And smoke out with the pedal to the floor on it
Niggas throwing salt I'm ignoring it
Hot Spitta standing in his own dookie he is on his shit

Bitches know the planes got it
Bitches know the planes got it

And I almost forgot...

My name is in the streets ...

And my name...

Is my name...
