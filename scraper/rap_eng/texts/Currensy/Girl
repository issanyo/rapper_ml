Fly Society (?0

[Hook: Darryl]
You can try to pretend like you don't want it
When you see me popping bottle with my homies
Girl you know how bad you want to break it off for me
Girl you know that I'm a G
And if you try to play hard to get
That (?)
And you don't have nobody to blame but your damn self
Girl you know I'm a G

[Verse: Curren$y]
Yes ma'am I am
The reason you even made these plans
To come to this club, you and your girls
Hoping that I'd come through with my thugs
These you was, there I stood
Fresh as a motherfucker smelling so good
Word on the street was I got that good jug
And it hurt for a minute until you get used to it
Baby you should
Break a nigga off
But if you don't it'll be your loss
Your girlfriend told you I did it like a boss
And when we got finished it was all over the walls
Do it so good it'll make a bitch stalk
Her nigga if she figure I don't want to talk
You don't want to get sprung like that dude
You know you do
Girl I see straight though

[Hook: Darryl]

And you don't have nobody to blame but your damn self
Girl you know I'm a G

[Interlude: Curren$y]
So G'ed up
So G'ed up
I'm so G'ed up
Hot Spitta nigga so G'ed up
Young Money so G'ed up
My nigga Wiz so G'ed up
My brother Mike so G'ed up
My nigga (?) so G'ed up
And that
Was the homie Darryl on the vocals
(?)
Imma have to sign him
Yup
