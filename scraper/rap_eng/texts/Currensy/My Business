[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
The Feds on my truck cause I'm gettin' that money with no job
From sun-up to sundown, a nigga done came up in no time
By countin' that money; I told that bitch I need a blowjob
She's sniffin' that white girl like Tony, this bitch need a nose job
You need it, I got it; you want it, I got it; that's no problem
Thirty-six O's, nigga; twenty-eight grams cause they know 'bout it
I come from the 'jects, got a gun on the jet; I'm the co-pilot
I hustle that yola; this cocaine music like Yo Gotti
This shit never fail; I'm catchin' a flight and then catchin' a body
They told me I couldn't
I made it this far, ain't no lookin' behind me
Them niggas be hatin', them hoes be stalkin', them cops be watchin'
They bitin' my style
I switched up my style, but they still gon' copy
I'm mindin' my business
My mind on my business
I'm buildin' a business
Man, I was trippin, I got off that sofa and had to go get it
I'm tryin' to stay safe, them niggas they givin' out toe tags
But I'm gettin' paid, I got dead pres in that brown bag

[Hook: Young Roddy]
And I been ridin' round makin' money all day
Fuckin' bitches, makin' that money all day
Been on my Grizzly makin' that money all day
Nigga been busy makin' that money all day
And I been ridin' round makin' money all day
Fuckin' bitches, makin' that money all day
Been on my Grizzly makin' that money all day
Nigga been busy makin' that money all day

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
On my mind, in my pocket, in my wallet
Shoe boxes, mattresses, safety deposits; various options
Got it from plottin', watchin', playin' and scoutin'
Bad bitches drive from Miami
Scannin' the room, some niggas is scammers
Sheisters, rhyme-biters, infiltrators, crew dividers
We can't let them beside us, that could destroy the cypher
Never that, though
Hennessy Viper, park it by the back, though
Getaway car driven with precision
Makin' turns in them blades sharp
Don't get hurt on the curb, bitch
We really stars, them other niggas is herbs
We satellite-high, still on Earth, absurd
The shit a nigga do with them words, they like birds
Flip 'em like flapjacks; Spitta make that paper stack
Fuck what you heard, nigga really in it
One of the livest till them suckers try
But never, ever, will I, die

[Hook: Young Roddy]
And I been ridin' round makin' money all day
Fuckin' bitches makin' that money all day
Been on my Grizzly makin' that money all day
Nigga been busy makin' that money all day
And I been ridin' round makin' money all day
Fuckin' bitches, makin' that money all day
Been on my Grizzly makin' that money all day
Nigga been busy makin' that money all day
