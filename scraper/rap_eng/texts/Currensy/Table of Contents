[Curren$y]
Right hand to God...
I done this for our side...
Every time I smoke and ride...

Eastside on the rise...
Corporation never die...
Let's all get high...
Till our eyes turn to dollar signs...
Money forever on my mind...

Owners Manual...
Shit you don't get till you get it...
Get it?

Smoked out with my niggas...
You'll die to live how we livin'...
Puttin' money away for the children...
My unborn sittin' on millions...
Shit...

Done that for our side...
Just like every time...
Eastside on the rise...
Five-oh-four on mine...
Jet Life...
