[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Riding in my homeboy Buick Riviera
Blowing that killa in the good weather
Feeling like Goodfellas
This real life no movie director no movie projector
Just jealous ass niggas with Beretta pistols
Don't let them get you
Gotta stay one step quicker my nigga don't let them near you
Watch your neck if they next to you
They living off you but they still wishing debt to you
Cold world but its still spinning
Can't do nothing bout it but try to live in it
And to try to raise kids in it
Make millions keep it hidden
Cause motherfuckers might try to kill you
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
Tried to catch me slipping but we hit you already
Rolled on your set in my Chevy
From inside your house you heard and you smelled me

[Hook: Curren$y]
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
Try to catch us slipping but we hit you already
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready

[Verse 2: Tiny C-Style]
Stay ready like Lil Caesar
Put red dots on you like a slice of pizza
Sly like a visa miss me with that talk, dont believe you
Come to the land and get taxed like a parking meter
Whole gang strapped like football helmets
You see them NFL tax better run for it
You niggas Gump like forest kick shit like Chuck Norris
Maybach with the rasp but you ridin' in the Ford Taurus
No safety on the 40 im ready at all times
Shit get hectic when you G and pushing real lines
Long beach state of mind make me do it to him
One shot from the draco guaranteed you ruined
Fly to Miami with some bad ones and chill for a week
Look for a plug to help me flood these streets
I rap now but if you stay ready you ain't got to worry bout
How you gon eat, major key

[Hook: Curren$y] x2
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
Try to catch us slipping but we hit you already
We just stayin' ready so we ain't gotta get ready
