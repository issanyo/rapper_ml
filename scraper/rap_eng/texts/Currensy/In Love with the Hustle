[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
Sucka niggas can't wear they nice watches out
To these spots where we smoke pot park the low riders outside was receiving no love
No hookup, no plug boy whatchu' thought this was
Shorts in the water, landmines in the mud
The rhymes is the drugs so they can't lock me up
Medical prescription for the bud, I need it
It's like breathing I do it without thinking, it's like blinking
Closer to second nature the game is first person
Hop out & left my doors open on purpose
My interior perfect want you to see what i'm working with
[Hook - Curren$y]
Some of the coolest niggas ever done it
Dirty south flow though all the hoes love it
Thirty-thousand dollars on luggage
Blue-baby [?] couldn't find where the coke is
Baby you ain't seen nun
When the center bag coming we'll be really stuntin'
I'm just in love with the hustle
She love me but i'm just in love with the hustle
[Verse 2 - TY]
Levis, there the hustle in my jeans no slim fit
Parallel park with a slim bitch, slim thick
Grew up like me independent, no pops, no air lil nigga no drop she a straight shooter
Rest of the game flex on her like Lex Luger
Dates to the shooting range let her bust the rugger
I don't @ & my niggas don't play
Some niggas throw dollars other niggas throw shade
It's that plastic steel fresh out the plastic
Trill ones love it & the lames can't grasp it
Used to keep my billfold tucked in my socks
Kilo, half o', five flavors for the block travel light
Them other niggas really ain't whitcha'
Every chance they get wanna pose for the picture
Time equals money so I don't like to move out my seat if I can't get whitcha'

[Verse 3 - Corner Boy P]
I know they out there hoping that I fall off but fuck y'all
Money all through my call log i'm a young gawd
Probably get it checked out the game because I ball hard
Got yo chick playing with my stick like she on Star Wars
Looking for the bag every city that i'm in
Came in game face on show me where dem chips
Pour the money in the front so it's easy for me to dip
Got all my chains on every time I hit the strip
I can tell them clowns that you brought whitcha'
My game so tight try and steal it it's gone pinch you
Everyday I keep it G noting less nigga
