How do you stop Fly Society?
There ain't no mother fucking answers
I did it on my own, ain't nobody did it for him
No disrespect to Richard Pryor
But I could set myself on fire (?) dancer
Street racers in their Mitsubishi Lancers
Chevy riders bump inside their Caprice classics
Flight club, display their shoes wrapped in plastic
I get one of everything that I don't think is whack shit
In the back of the chaffeured Cadillac truck
We pack rows of bitches
Limited edition 'til the cargo area filled up
Get back to the telly
Smoke a W, Beverly Hills up
Tripping off these bad girls stripping eating pills up
Bitch want me to choke her and fuck er
I don't want to fuck around and kill her
My brother says the top don't drop (?)
I say let the sky be your ceiling
Yeah

Why can't you be more like him
This that Jet music nigga
