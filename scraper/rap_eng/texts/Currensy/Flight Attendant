Curren$y the Hot Spitta
What up Cannon!
Yup
Right

Sitting in the first class cabin
Of the airplane with my iPod blasting
The captain instructs us to prepare for landing
Flight attendant walks up politely asking me
To cut off the music and raise my seat
To the upright position where it's 'sposed to be
To make sure I don't receive no injuries
When the wheels touched down the tire screeched
Then she looked at my face and said "Naw it can't be"
"Haven't I seen you on T.V.?"
"Or heard you in music with Weezy Wee?"
I said yes you did baby I'm that kid
Got an arc shaped driveway at my crib
'Cause when it comes to the whips i got more than six
Flying one after another like look at my shit
But now I better quit 'cause that's not important
You working on this plane, what you doing when you get off it
'Cause now you in New Orleans where you are just a tourist
I'll bring you through my city and I promise you'll enjoy it

(Laughter)
Yeah
Yeah
That's that Spitta shit
You know

Tell them niggas don't bother me
