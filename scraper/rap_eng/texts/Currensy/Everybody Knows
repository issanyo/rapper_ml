[Intro: Curren$y]

Uh...shit from my gas
Seperating ourselves from our past
Perfectin' our roll over the yams
That's why, we here
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Verse 1: Joey Fatts]
Pacin' around the villa in some Supreme slippers
On the phone with my lawyer talkin' about six figures
Don't mistake the enigma, boy I'm a street nigga
Just educated, so these people like to deal with us
Infatuated with laws, checks, and money rolls
Without mistaking, we blow it because it comes and go
I got her waitin', she open, she's trying to come and go
You probably think she a hoe, but she out a centerfold
Say this the life of a don
Keep the baddest queen up under my arm
Because a king shall fuck on a pawn
Say its chess not checkers, baby
God in these streets, these other niggas reverends, baby
Ain't shit changed, yeah I'm still off 7th baby
Swervin' and swervin', pushin' a 6
Had my pops sick when I went spent 80 on this
He said I ain't learned shit when he was movin' these bricks
I said only if he knew how much money I'm gettin', nigga

[Hook: JMSN]
Yeah
But everybody knows (because everybody knows)
Everybody knows, and I'm fine without you
People come and go, but everybody knows
That I'm fine without you

[Verse 2: Curren$y)
Yeah
Shiftin' gears
Seperatin' ourselves from our peers
Perfectin' our roles over the years
This is why we here, still, with so
Many people ended up lost
And fell off, but I remain
A boss at all cost
Depositin' more cake in the vault
Crazy pay from the verbal assault
Made me a star, bought my daddy a car
Diamond pieces for my niece
My niggas ask for guns and keys
Some of my niggas just want degrees
Help out all my dawgs
I don't think none of them wrong
Kick it with the livin', the dead ones live on
Through the songs
See their face in smoke traces from the bong
Shit so serious, man, project window, box fan
To the air conditioned Rolls Royce sedan
Was the plan, nigga

[Hook: JMSN]
Yeah
But everybody knows (because everybody knows)
Everybody knows, and I'm fine without you
People come and go, but everybody knows
That I'm fine without you
