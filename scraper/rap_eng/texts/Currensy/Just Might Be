[Intro]
Just might be
Just might be, just might be
Just might be Pilot Talk 3
Nigga

[Verse 1]
Niggas thought I was sleep
Cause of how far I laid back my seat
But I could see through rain, snow, and sleet
The sunshine, it's son time
Music industry lunchline
I been standing in that mufucka for a long time tryna eat
Full tray, extra jello, vintage mistress
French vanilla, Ferrari Maranello

[Hook]
This just might be
This just might be
This just might be Pilot Talk 3

[Verse 2]
Low mileage, high driving
Know they waiting for a drug lord to hop out it
Waiting for the moment we can stop browsing, start clowning
Cop it all, tear the walls out it
Fucking shawty got it
Correct amount of dollars I be all about it
Professional cheffer, audio narcotics
Guarantee the quality of all my products
Astrology, see all the stars around us

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Back over the stove cause they want some mo'
Sleeping outside for it like they waiting on Jordans
I can't afford to not record
Bring it on tour, perform that shit through a cordless
Landscapers on my property well paid
Pulling off the compound in droptop Porsches
Remembering haircuts on front porches
Telling my older homies that the whole world was waiting on me

[Hook]
