[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I can have her if I got her in my ride
Sat her in the spaceship
Played them oldies
Got her digging on me, mind blown
Trying to catch my eyes
But I’m focused on the road to the money
Where I'm going it won’t be waiting long for me
Cause them niggas racing trying to get there before me
Visions of Tony, floating facedown in his fountain
There was blood and cocaine just pouring out him
Got me cautiously plottin', failure not an option
When the stakes is this high, you rolling craps with diamonds, dice
Shit dead serious, intense like two white cops in yo' rearview mirror
They might cut they lights on just to cut your lights out
And you just chillin'
These thoughts in the back of the mind of every black man livin'
At the same time gotta watch my step this a active minefield
This ain't no motherfucking movie set
But I make it look easy, catching stunts just breezing
Believe me I gotta joint lit if I'm not sleeping
Every option on that moonroof, alloys and Bose speakers
Leather seats, playing for keeps, all my peoples, stadium seats to the park bleachers

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Yea, rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Rolling, threw some chrome ones on my spaceship
Throw my Rollie out the window of the spaceship
Smoke a OZ while I'm floating in the spaceship
Yea, rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Throw my Rollie out the window in the spaceship, yea yea

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
Paper on top of paper that money coming in
Roll up another Wood while sitting in my Benz
They tell me to chill but Imma keep on going in
You ain't keeping it real then get the fuck from round here
Park my shit right the avenue, spark a Back or two
Thank my homie for that alley-oop I smashed her on the roof
G Nikes with the Bally suit I had to match the tool
Just because I seen you with the homie, don't be acting new
I was born with the vibe you just caught it out the blue
I be working with my high, doing math like I'm in school
One box touch down, another coming soon
Call my nigga Boston George he'll fly with 'em too
Man this shit'll be so crazy cause my life really a movie
Bunch of scenes from the 80's, getting money like Lucas
Rollie out the window so you see me shine
Jet Life stay on gang til' the day I die

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Yea, rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Rolling, threw some chrome ones on my spaceship
Throw my Rollie out the window of the spaceship
Smoke a OZ while I'm floating in the spaceship
Yea, rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Rolling, threw some gold ones on my spaceship
Throw my Rollie out the window of the spaceship, yea yea
