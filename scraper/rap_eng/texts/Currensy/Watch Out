[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, pulled up at the plaza, Porsche Tony Montana
Fog light with the scanners, my life a extravaganza
Cadillac top is canvas, stoned all the time, laughin'
I got super-high standards, Atlanta mansion all through the traffic
Muched out and famished
Lunch, got the sandwich and the grape Fanta
Can't be out, dash for cash
I outran the last man that broke's plans down to shambles
Why would you even gamble? Why would you even chance it?
I know you seen devils dancin', you thought the shit was romantic
Now your whole life through your hand slip

[Hook]
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
Watch out

[Verse 2]
You niggas' Comedy Central, bitches stuntin' in the rental
I just bought another Bentley, Forgiato sent the rims through
I just got another package, BBC done sent me everything
Ice Cream Season 1 jackets, bitch, I shine like my pinky rings
Watch out, lil' bitch
Pulled up, rolled the window down, I stuck my watch out, lil' bitch
All of these spirits got killed, robbed them of they confidence
Hater look down at his wrist like, "Why am I wearin' this shit?"

[Hook]
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch, yeah

[Verse 3]
Uh, you a buster in a fake watch, I'm a hustler in a hardtop
Few more bars, then I stop, ready for the holiday drop
Canal Street bars, they out
So many sports cars on the block, they concerned if it's legal or not
Watch out, lil' bitch, watch out, lil' bitch
December 4, my shit drop, real shit
Work hard, work hard, then you stunt on a bitch
Finger roll-off to pick hoes like, "Oh, you ballin' and shit?"
Watch out, lil' bitch

[Outro]
Yeah, Canal Street Confidential
Available everywhere December 4, act like you know
