[Intro]
I'm up in this bitch
I'm up with your bitch
It's 4 AM in this bitch

[Hook x2]
I ride by and them bitches wave, but girl, I can't stop
I ride by and them boppers wink, but girl, I can't stop

[Verse 1]
I'm up in this bitch, in this bitch
I'm up with your bitch, with your bitch
It's 4 AM in this bitch, in this bitch
We gon' fuck again in this bitch, in this bitch
You by yourself in the crib
Stressing about where she is, who she's with
She after me cause I'm rich, cause I'm rich
Tryna outsex me and shit, doin' tricks
I'm not impressed by this shit, not a bit
Seen it before, yes I did, one more 'gain
I'm in that '76 bumpin' Pimp
I'm on my way to the chips

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Alright, I'm ridin' around, ridin' around
Ferrari low to the ground, on the ground
I do my thing in the town, I get down
Come through smellin' like a pound, yeah, I'm loud
Highed up, lookin' down on them clowns
And them hoes at home, where's my crown?
Can't stay if you don't pay me, baby
My passion is paper, for you I ain't got no patience, baby
Give you the smash of your life, and then I'm skatin', baby
Wanna see me again? Have that cash waitin', baby
Shit...

[Hook x2]
