[Produced by Purps of 808 Mafia]

[Verse 1]
Drove bout five four cars in the same night
Keep switching up
Show my other niggas they can get it too
No giving up
Safe house a couple hundred thousand now
Keep picking up
Gasoline can't get no louder that
Kicking your ear drums
Got some slappers from 808 Mafia
You should go get you some
Depend on how your budget run
How fast your money come
I'm from New Orleans, my nigga I gotta stunt
We tryna run up on some type of shit that my niggas be Waiting on
Organization taking for 'em
Bitches be bringing the paper for 'em
Rolling their weed and paper for 'em
Journal entries I read aloud
Them record labels keep paying for 'em
Thirty minutes got a plane to board
To the airport in a racing car
Charge it to the nigga playing card
Momma praying for me, oh lord

[Hook]
I could move a boulder through a Boost Mobile
You could get it if you do it how I showed you
In presence of pressure
Keep your composure
Stand tall soldier
You'll ball before it's all over
(Fuck waiting baby, get your paper
Fuck bitches, won't stack your riches
If they don't see you
Make em hear about you
And when you see em, make those fuckers feel you)

[Verse 2]
This information could start a war
What's in the paper can start a car
They caught the vapors from chasing stars
Drop top, park chevy's, all soft
Dug em out like they fucking golf carts
Burn 'em out on the basketball court
What it's all for, what it's all for
For my fam, nigga, cause I'm all heart
On the top floor at the Waldorf
Nigga dumb fresh but I'm too smart
To slip up with niggas and get caught
What you looking at is a real boss
Got a line of niggas that'll kill for him
But it's all good cause I'm too high
Tryna come up with another five million
Build me a building me so we can hide in it
To the ceiling, money piling in it
No miles on it, windows not tinted
Hot Spitta in a 560 Benz
High vintage shit, fly isnâ€™t it
I could show you how I done it, start a company and run it
Hustle that you put in to it
You can pull more than double from it

[Hook]
I could move a boulder through a Boost Mobile
You could get it if you do it how I showed you
In presence of pressure
Keep your composure
Stand tall soldier, you'll ball before it's all over
(Fuck waiting baby, get your paper
Fuck bitches, won't stack your riches
If they don't see you, make em hear about you
And when you see em, make those fuckers feel you)

[Outro]
I could move a boulder through a Boost Mobile
You could get it if you do it how I showed you
In presence of pressure
Keep your composure
Stand tall soldier
You'll ball before it's all over
