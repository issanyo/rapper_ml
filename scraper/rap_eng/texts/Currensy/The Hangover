[Refrain]
We smoke and drink all night
Hangover cause we hung out
Chicks know we party that's why
They love it when we come out
Have the time of your life
Before all your time run out
Put them bottles on ice while
I roll another one up

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Come through with that killer weed
Alfred Hitchcock in the Zip Lock
Zig Zags and a Jones Soda
Let shorty twist one up for the pit stop
Scratch off, AC on
Windows up, new shit playin'
What you sayin? Nathan
Dollar signs my only language
Fluently speak it
And reject fools comin' in my lane with that weak shit
That's how I keep it
The game in my pocket like a Nintendo DS
I left my last one on the jet
I got mistakes I make
So I don't lay down till the sunrise

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Mikey Rocks]
I'm in the fire twelves, twelves
High as hell, man
I'm tryna nail
We can leave, find your cell
Lock my number in like you're takin' it for hostage
Try'na put you on the game, maybe you should watch it
They takin' trips to Aspen flyin' kites all in the tropics
Watch the Pistons against the Bulls on the floor with the mascot
Dancin', fly as Helly Hansen on our shoulder blades
And we tip the waiter good, you can keep the change
That's Italian gold herringbone if you peep the chain
I keep a little reefer in my sneaker if we need the flame
Drink until I gotta piss, damn I got a lot of chicks
Take another sip of what I'm drinkin'
And I'm out of it

[Refrain x2]
