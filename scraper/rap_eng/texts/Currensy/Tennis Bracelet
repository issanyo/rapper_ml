[Studio Chatter]
Shout out to the homie dollar for the muhfuckin' spades
DJ T on the way to the studio too
(that bitch a hall-of-famer though too
Don't sleep on that but it's all good)
The bottle we got in this motherfucker is right up from out the club
Walked out that muhfucker last night with it
We ain't get to pop it
Popped too many of them

[Verse]
She said hi nice to meet
I was in my 63'
Got hydraulics in the trunk
I can make it jump six feet
Off the ground
I'm a clown
I come down like a real G
A real one is all I am
Mama, that's all I'll ever be
Tires screech in the east
They do donuts in them Z's
They do donuts in them 'Vettes
Baby this the life of Jets
I hung out with her twice
But I haven't fucked her yet
Now she vexed
Now she pressed
Now she taking off her dress
Vinyl records, marijuana, and sex
So yes the stage was set
Performance award winning
I think she left her bra in here
Her girls calling with questions
Like, "Bitch, how big is it?"
Mama come see for yourself
I'm up in here smoking and chillin
She see money all around me
I look like I am the man
But bitch I really am
You can tell
Cause I pull up in that motherfucking Lamb with my man'z, Smoking on that killer piff
Banging Killer Cam
Yeah
Eastside
