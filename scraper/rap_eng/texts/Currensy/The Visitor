[Verse]
Parachutes deploy with minimal noise
You being visited by the hammer boys
Motion detectors won't even protect you
You shoulda followed directions down to the last letter
Crossed your T's and dotted your I's
Got caught skimming frosting from the top of the pie
That's your fault, can't feel sorry for you
I'm filling the vault, casualties of war what's a loss when you a boss
We gotta break a couple legs
If everybody at the table deserves to be fed
Tough guys organized crime I was led
Down a pathway of dollar signs and bloodshed
But still kept a positive attitude
Can't keep shoo-shooing with you if I'm really on the move
Progress to the next stage, next phase
The feds thought I had my hands all in that point shave
Associated, affiliated
The pro's and con's to having your face on that front page, kid
Lavish surroundings, Impalas with blades
Exotic sports cars parked on the lawn every which way
Lady assassin, two-day travel, carry out plays
Diamond heist baby carrying out trays

[Outro x2]
Keep the E in it, Chevy's on switches nigga
We smoking weed in it, laughing in our pictures
Wouldn't talk about it if niggas didn't live it
If you don't believe it then you could come and visit
If you need to see it then ask one of your bitches
If she bad she probably kick it
She so glad she did it
And its hurting you to admit it
