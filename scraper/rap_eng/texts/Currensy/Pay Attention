[Hook]
See niggas coming for me and my diamonds when they glisten
Now pay attention
Jet Life Life...

[Verse 1]
14 karat gold bathroom fixtures
Medusa faces on my pillow cases, this is living
Sucker niggas wanna see it ended
Last straw must have been when they heard about that Bentley
Damn dog, I was just chilling
Fools had loot before me, I ain't wanna kill them
Fuck wrong with going to get it?
Y'all got me twisted, I work hard for this shit
I got it, I ain't hiding it, riding 'round got my joint lit
A Vick of that OG in the Louie bag, I'm a boss, bitch
Them suckers ain't like us, they ain't jets, hardly
Not cool partially, they totally off key
You can call me Mr. Mo G's
Cause I stack them up like 10 stories
Applaud these moves I made that got me paid
I know what it is, the lights used to get turned off in my crib
Shook that shit off, destroy, rebuild, I'm a boss
And the Lifers gon' get high to this shit
Count a million in the vault, listen to the Jet laws

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Handling in that Porsche Carrera like it's fucking stolen
Told the man in the mirror, "You's a fucking cold blooded nigga"
Igloo, my whole crew a bunch of eskimos in here
Flow cold, I can make a polar bear shiver
Haters got the tight face, looking Joan Rivers
They all upset, no seats on the jet
Them hoes ain't walking home wit' ya
They only on you when you on nigga
That's game from a OG, these ain't songs
Nigga this Spitta, no country for quitters
My mind on a million, my hands on the wheel
I'm on the road to the riches

And I'm playing my mirrors
