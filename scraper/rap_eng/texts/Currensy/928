Let's do it bro

Yeah, Yeah

Weed and Instrumentals
88 coupe
Quicker than a Baretta when it shoot
88 coupe
88 coupe
Quicker than a Baretta when it shoot


[Verse]
1988, Louisiana plates on St. Charles Ave
Parked behind the iron gates
You don't got what it takes, to take my place
Champagne for the ones who won the race
Calm in my position, cause I don't feel threatened by the competition
In fact I welcome the opposition
Let the lions in, so they can admire the marbled floors
The fire place I placed in my den
That's the difference between mice and men
Difference between bright and dim
Why we are how we are,  and we don't act nothing like them
Conversation topic, what model was he driving
What model was he with, what strain was his exotic
Rare fabric's, special fibers, steps guided
Avoiding serpents and vipers
Porsche wind shield wipers help me see through the light showers

[Outro]
88 coupe
Quicker than a Baretta when it shoot
88 coupe
88 coupe
Quicker than a Baretta when it shoot
88 coupe
88 coupe
Quicker than a Baretta when it shoot
