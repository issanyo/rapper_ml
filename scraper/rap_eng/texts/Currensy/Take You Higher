[Intro: R. Kelly (Sample)]
Let me take you higher
And let you know how you should feel
Let me take you higher
And let you know how you should feel

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
A cloud of smoke in the coupe
Vocal dope in the booth
Every grip bing true (true)
That's why I get the loot
That's how I can get you
Admit that I know what did it
You seen me swerving in it
Balled out with  a  high percentage
Range like Reggie Miller but I handle like Iverson
I should probably drop my own tenni's
Score points and get fly with 'em
Joints rolled with the fire in 'em
Said she trying to take it to the moon
We ain't even got to leave the room
Don't tell me you fuck with the shrooms
My little brother pulling up soon
Said he had a batch that was cool
Just let me know what you're trying to do
Imma go roll up another one
The Doors playing Waiting For the Sun
With the doors on the Wraith opened up
Now I see what they're hating on
You should get your paper, what you waiting on

[Outro: R. Kelly (Sample)]
Let me take you higher
And show you how you should feel
Let me take you higher
And show you how you should feel
Let me take you higher
And show you how you should feel
Let me take you higher
And show you how you should feel
Let me take you
Let me take you higher
And show you how you should feel
