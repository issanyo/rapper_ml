[Verse 1]
A G proceeds to smoke weed
Never have a want, nigga never have a need
Saw my low rider on the Kush D-V-D
Bouncing in the driveway, yeah nigga that was me
I was California cruising in New Orleans deep
Bumping D.P.G, turning corners on 3's
Nigga please, you fucking with me?
Clay Davis style, nigga sheeeiiit
M3's got nothing on me
Checkerboard Louie's with the lime green strings
LV pouch full of kush OG
Ball so hard in these N.O. streets
Chris Paul gonna' vote me as the MVP
Give a motherfuck about this industry
And their politics, just recorded a lot of shit
That'll break the world off proper shit
Dropped independents then niggas said, "okay"
I guess this nigga Spitta got something to say
Some niggas hating be like, "he ain't straight"
But they know I got the flow of a motherfuckin' great
These niggas so motherfucking fake
If you see a hater blow some smoke in their face
Tell them bitch niggas raise up
Fly niggas light your J's up

[Hook]
I'm living like a baller, whoa
Add the money, I'm blowing hella chronic smoke
I'm living like a baller loc
Add the money, I'm blowing hella chronic smoke

[Verse 2]
Homie I'm just loc'in, got that low low on them dayton
Spokes, and tryin' to keep it in focus
Cause I don't want ya'll to notice
That I'm loaded, I been smoking
I am twisted, and I wish that I didn't drive
Got to give the keys to tweet, play the passenger seat
On the cellphone to see if your girl home
It went to the voicemail and a nigga didn't leave no message
A live bitch will respect it
She called right back and gave me directions
Now she in the Chevy and the bitch half naked
Blowing on a zip of that best shit
Prolly fuck around and ride all the way to Texas
Life in the fast lane, spent half my life on an airplane
But I wouldn't let a motherfucking thing change

[Hook]
