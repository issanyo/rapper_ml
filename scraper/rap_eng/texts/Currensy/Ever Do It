[Intro: Curren$y]
Yup
Da da da da da da
Turnin' this all into paper
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Berner]
Been together since we were kids
Through thick and thin you made me rich, I couldn't quit
It's hard to switch, you put a hunnid fifty on my wrist
We took trips, the risk it got me feeling sick
It's a crazy rush, I could never make enough
You make it hard for me to sleep, why you wake me up?
You've been crazy lately, why you getting people killed?
Only few respect you, the rest will probably squeal
You taught me how to turn a intro to a couple bills
Different level deals, damn I miss the homie Phil
Every time I take a loss, I start to hate you more
Another war, who's keeping score, we winnin' more
I love the game, keep the fame, bullet proof the range
And dig a hole for the lames, shit will never change
And this is for the one and only
The dope game, your homie Bern'
They got nothin' on me

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Candy paint range drizzle skittles on my latest
I got polish on my Daytons
I got lil' mama waiting
I pull up to her spot daily on my rounds gettin' my paper
Occasionally call her baby though she not my lady
Paper crazy? Yeah
I been chasin' bags and I spin it fast, then replace them rags
Lace it up, all facts, If I ever spat
It was a song about stoners who made stacks
Put my city on the map
Stuck my safe in the wall like thumbtacks
Runnin' back, touchdown, homie, where that money at?
Range Rover, smokin' doja, [?] bumpin' No Limit Soldiers
I miss C-Murder and the homie Mac
Locked behind bars, open up my weed jars
Rollin' up them fatties while my homies rap
See, we wan't born wit' it, dat weed was no choice but to go get it
That's what make us all go-getters

[Chorus: Cozmo]
Candy paint, Caddy doors, keep the weed lit
Man, you know how we get, we be on that G-shit
Sunrise to sundown, we re-up then we re-flip
We wasn't 'spose to be shit
Now we blowin' Gs (the best to ever do it)
Hunnid packs, Maybachs, keep the weed lit
Man, you know how we get, we be on that G-shit
Sunrise to sundown, we re-up then we re-flip
We wasn't 'spose to be shit
Now we blowin' Gs (the best to ever do it)

[Verse 2: Green R. Fieldz]
Said we just eatin', what we been doin'
Off the fat of the land, we sprout the seed sewn
Exotic weed blowin', got the trees growin'
Acres of the Z goin'
Fam, get the pack on the arm, two-hunnid Ps floatin'
Machine in motion, been the plug for a couple moments
Ups and downs, rollercoastin' but we feel we chosen
Deep as oceans but we get it with this jet propulsion
Stayin' focused, sit back, relax and roll this
Achieve goals, ash roaches
Grab vultures by they fuckin' wings and pluck 'em out your airspace
Don't ever let your sun get blocked by their shade (no)
I said don't ever let your sun get block by their shade
I got a full sun field of dreams, all organic (haha)
I stuck my neck out a few times, that was the standard (uh huh)
Brought the fellas with me, didn't leave 'em abandoned (come on)
Now the eagle's landed, all the packs are stamped and branded (skittles)
Left 'em standin', powered [?] and we took full advantage (yup)
Now the trinkets and accessories all dipped and lavish
Different standards of what we accept in general
And that's what makes us all Generals (yeah, Generals)

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
For the money we bled, you heard what he said
I'm try'na think of somethin' clever that go over your head
Cargo, off with the top, came straight off of the block
I'm 'bout to put the play together like A.I. with the [?]
I'm talkin' profit margin, baby, I got my eyes on the stock
I keep a squad full of bosses, we be vibin' a lot
I be fly as a plane
Baby, I made my own lane, no, we are not one in the same
I'm not like these lames
Fresh [?] don't gotta sting, [?] but I can't complain
I smile through the pain
I got two feet in the game
I got my hands on the money then I went insane
The weight of the world on my shoulder, I'm hopin' I don't get a sprain, yeah
Hunnid bands switchin' lanes, while you slidin' wit'cha mane
Throw some karats on the chain
Got some money, stayed the same
I ain't in it for the fame
I ain't in it for the politicin', never been a Politician, mane
But I [?] bad when [?] fuckin' with the vision with the campaign
Every since a young nigga switched up his hustle, nothin' been the same
Late nights on the grind, I can't even sleep, the money on my brain

[Chorus: Cozmo]
Candy paint, Caddy doors, keep the weed lit
Man, you know how we get, we be on that G-shit
Sunrise to sundown, we re-up then we re-flip
We wasn't 'spose to be shit
Now we blowin' Gs (the best to ever do it)
Hunnid packs, Maybachs, keep the weed lit
Man, you know how we get, we be on that G-shit
Sunrise to sundown, we re-up then we re-flip
We wasn't 'spose to be shit
Now we blowin' Gs (the best to ever do it)
