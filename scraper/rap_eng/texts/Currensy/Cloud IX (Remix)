[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Spent twenty racks on my chain, then I spent another rack on my sweatshirt
Multi-million dollar networth, hoes wanna know how them jets work
I’m like hold on you been one so don’t complain to me your neck hurt
We gon ride the Ferrari's tomorrow, we gon’ ride them Corvettes first
I'm like bitch please, diss me Mitchel and Ness
Pistol P, Impala 1963 and them gold D's
Them 13's or them chrome supremes
Clacking the back, you know it's me
I'm high, creeping at a low speed
Clown niggas sleeping on me, them bedbugs fasho gone eat
I'm like yeah chief in the driver seat, that's a whole new list of problems
Rich nigga issue, haters tryna stick ya, even these bitches is assassins or robbers
Nigga threw some slangs at me, wardie I called that
My brother drew down first them suckers had to fall back

[Hook: Scotty ATL]
I go up, I go up
But I ain’t playing with it, I do my thing with it
I go up, I go up
Take me high in the sky, let the problems float away
I go up, I go up
But I ain’t playing with it, I do my thing with it
I go up, I go up
Take me high in the sky, let the problems float away

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
Boo told me I was talking last night in my sleep bout the payback
All I remember, had a drop top Impala and a Maybach
Wheels cost bout a fortune man, I'm the black version, Pat Sajak
Smoking good at the Outkast concert, niggas bring the A back
Shawty thick like [?], rolling blunts like the rastas
Took her back to mi casa, real nigga my roster
Non-believers do your research, run the game till my feet hurt
RIP to my lost ones, on my heart and my t-shirt

[Pre-Hook: Scotty ATL]
Balling off and on
Niggas tired of that, niggas tryna be balling every day
Weed and lots to drink
Crazy stupid high
Let the money float like a river do
Probably to the sky, smoke into the sky

[Hook: Scotty ATL]
I go up, I go up
But I ain’t playing with it, I do my thing with it
I go up, I go up
Take me high in the sky, let the problems float away
I go up, I go up
But I ain’t playing with it, I do my thing with it
I go up, I go up
Take me high in the sky, let the problems float away
