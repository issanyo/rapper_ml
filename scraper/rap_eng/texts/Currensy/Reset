You niggas is, cheap greens, artificial turf
Second in the presence of better, me first
Captain America vs Captain Planet
I control the larger area
Super hero, no cape
Delta force in the third grade
Now or Laters
Basketball cards in my school pants
How to be a player
Got to ask then you can't afford the movie, neighbor
Drop jewels like a butterfinger watch-maker
Money so old it deserve an in-home caretaker
I been talkin' this shit for a minute
Never been called out just been called that nigga
I paid dudes and I tipped em'
I ain't trippin'
Check yo' prescription
Lynches I'm not Pippen
We both scorin' but mine's more awesome
Bitches called him, we smell the weed in the Air Jordans, yeah
Over land, sea, air
Scratch it off the list after I been there
Yeah jets, everytime I drop bars the bar is reset
Stack change and I didn't change
Lookin' down on these fools
Balcony rap, I'm way too high for that, bullshit
So save it neighbor I'm on my paper
Bitch what you think this is
I only fucked twice
Girl what you think you did
Ain't nobody throw rice, spitta, ninja, precise, slice
Overheat never, under pressure, sweat ice, what's pressure
I never felt pressure in my life, it's been a cakewalk
Frosting on my nikes, don't let em' talk
Cut a hater wind short, Chevrolet bow-tie
Tips on the end of my exhaust pipe
Bitches at the window pray they hear that sound every night
But I'm out baby
You my homegirl but this not my house lady
Can't go for that
Fall through, get the cut, clean up, change clothes
Adherent to the jet code, you know how we roll
