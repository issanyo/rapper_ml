[Hook]
I spend 50, make my pinky bling
My ice hockey rink
They just think, we've been moving things
They've been watching me
Tryna' trail, me back to my plug, ain't no supplying me
Cause I'm the one, who know magic
Watch me flip one into three

[Verse]
All I do, lace them tablets, lines they never read between
Hide that dope in plane sight, making money all night
See that pure cocaine I write, put that paper in my life
If I want, I buy on sight
Do donuts at traffic lights
Hoes excited 'bout my life
Way blinded by the light
Star gazing in the Wraith, I just lit up that top flight
Own Wheels Collective
This years perspective
The figures have projected, they will never stop this jets shit
Floor of the safe house
Couple treasures protected
My Testarossa's, Bentley motor coach's
Hashtray infected with roaches
My hustle has paid for it
I grind, so I afford it
I get these bars recorded and we'll all be parking Porsche's

[Hook]
I spend 50, make my pinky bling
My ice hockey rink
They just think, we've been moving things
They've been watching me
Tryna' trail, me back to my plug, ain't no supplying me
Cause I'm the one, who know magic
Watch me flip one into three

[Verse 2]
I can turn three to five, I can turn five to nine
First I start off with a thought
Turn that thought into a rhyme
Turn that rhyme into a record
Turn that record into stacks
That's too much game, ya'll ain't pay me for that
WAIT

[Outro]
Yeah
I put 50, make my pinky bling
My ice hockey rink
(My ice hockey rink)
Weed & Instrumentals
I spent 50 to make my pinky bling
My ice hockey rink
(My ice hockey rink)
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Tryna' trail, me back to my plug, ain't no supplying me
(Tryna' trail me)
(Ain't no supplying me)
Turn one into three
