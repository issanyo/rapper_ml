[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Year-round we them niggas
You seasonal, temporary living
Your run'll be done in a minute
You are not infinite
Bitches can tell the difference, they know better than to smoke with ya
Back up a lil' bit, you'll get the whole picture
So much sicker than them niggas, I'm coughing they just got hiccups
KC lights, roll bars on my Chevy pickup
Off-road style, lift kit, heavy duty springs
Stomper tires get it done when the time is crunch like sit-ups
To the challenge I rise, Lamborghini doors
'85 Countach never seen a real road
From the showroom floor to my seven car garage
Got a storage 'cross town with like seven more rides
Tucked inside - that Grand Theft Auto life
Rolling up in my safe house I'm looking down
Done it by my design, refusing to comprimise

Mestizo eyes
Mestizo eyes

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
They saying shit changed cause shit changed
Not just the horses in my motor, but the cost for me to show up
I'm a boss, and my whole team fly private
Black cars when we roll up, quarter pounds when we blow up
Hit the ground running
My watch new cause a nigga sound bumping
And ya girlfriend leaving you cause she just wanna be around something
Like playing Xbox and wearing weed socks, speeding 'round stunting
Orderin' thousand dollar room service, rolling weed up by the onion
Ooo I got it made, but I ain't make it on my own
Who would've thought a Pittsburgh nigga would go and buy an LA home
Rolling up papers, turning down favors
All these fake kushes, I got my own flavor
Homie that ainâ€™t KK in that brand new bag
Got it made to make that brand new crib
Need a whip to match that brand new car
Thinking maybe Maybach brand new insides
Everything black, young ass nigga blowing OG in the back
Last time you heard from me, I was rolling bud up
Looking dope in my brand new clothes
Eyes closed like someone told 'em to shut up

[Hook]
