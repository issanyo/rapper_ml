[Intro]
Uh-oh
Somebody wanna donate a lighter to the cause?
G-Perico in the building and shit
Smoke one for my loved one

[Chorus]
4 Phantoms in a row, shit like a horror show
You really seein' ghosts, you better believe it though
Ride up your block slow, catchin' stunts on my old hoes
She sad like a funeral, but ain't nobody die though
4 Phantoms in a row, shit like a horror show
You really seein' ghosts, you better believe it though
Ride up the block slow, catchin' stunts on my old hoes
Sad like a funeral, but ain't nobody die though

[Verse 1]
Still in it for the cash, lotta niggas didn't last
They was clowns of the class, school of hard knocks, I passed
My engine beneath the glass, 20 grand for the luxury tax
'Cause I plan before I attack
Emotions had them niggas blowin' they stacks
I'm in here smokin' and pourin' some 'Yak
90 inch TV, I'm watchin' The Mack
I do my thing when it come to this rap
Underground king but do not call me that
Pimp and the Bun the original, I hope that my legacy similar
Closin' deals, not singular, plural we pickin' them digits up

[Chorus]
4 Phantoms in a row, shit like a horror show
You really seein' ghosts, you better believe it though
Ride up the block slow, catchin' stunts on my old hoes
Sad like a funeral, but ain't nobody die though

[Verse 2]
I do my thing when it come to rap
I been buyin' more jewelry because of that
I don't have nothin' to prove, black
It's just a lil stuntin', what's wrong with that?
I tell you the play like a Quarterback
Got the Scarface crib where the water at
Gucci slides across Versace door mats
Welcome to the hustle where nobody love you
Shine after you struggle, a long time my brother
Snakes just think of ways that they can take it from ya
That's what I discovered, lazy motherfuckers
Just tryna leach game from real hustlers
Stop and teach them fools a lil somethin'
But I gotta go, I got another mil comin'
Money chasin' got my track shoes on, I'm runnin' for it, yea

[Chorus]
4 Phantoms in a row, shit like a horror show
You really seein' ghosts, you better believe it though
Ride up your block slow, catchin' stunts on my old hoes
She sad like a funeral, but ain't nobody die though
4 Phantoms in a row, shit like a horror show
You really seein' ghosts, you better believe it though
Ride up the block slow, catchin' stunts on my old hoes
Sad like a funeral, but ain't nobody die though

[Outro]
4 Phantoms in a row, you really seein' ghosts
Shit like a horror show, she sad like a funeral
But ain't nobody die though, creepin' up the block slow
Catchin' stunts on my old hoes, I know you hear the horns blow
Wherever a king go, call that a procession though, professional
