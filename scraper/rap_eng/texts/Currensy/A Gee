And You Can't Do A Thang, About It

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
You Wanna Live In A House Dont Want No Grass To Grow
Yo Homeboys Lookin Bad And You Giving Cash To Them Hoes
Ol Sucka Ass Nigga Fuck You Round Here Fo?
Finna Take Off On The Pluckers? Man Cabin Door Closed Ho
O's Rolled Up Fuck It We Can Get Some Mo
Kinda Cotton Had To Stop At The 24 Hr Store
Drop Them Bomb Ass Tape V8 Crate Droptop
Sun Ain't Even Out But I Can't Wait For The Rain To Stop
Shine Rather Or Not You Wanna Deal With It
The Bitch In Yo Car Wanna Hear Us
Leer What? Jets Year one vets, From The Cars To The Broads Muthafucka Be My Guest, Yeahh

[Hook]
A Gee Is What I Am, A JET Is Who I Be
You Know What I Smoke And You Can't See Me
No Matter Where You Go, One Place We'll Never Be

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
On A Mission And Im Fishing For My Nigga Ski Beats
Quote Live Nigga Rap Broke A Jive Nigga Back
Spineless Spliff Cruising With Optimus Primus And In The Prime Is
Im Inclined To Sound Better Than Other Rhymers
Dont Bring Them Fools Around Him
He'll Make Em Look Clownish
Countach Lambo, Shoot Like Ammo, Through Traffic With Green Trees I Blend In Like Camo
Flauge, Gosh Oh My Where Was I
When Things Got Hot
Somewhere Cool Laughin At You
Fuck Rolling 1, Roll 2, Roll 3, Loop The Beat And Light An Insense In The Booth Yeaah

[Hook]
.... And You Can't See Me
No Matter Where U Go, One Place You'll Never Be
Is Close Even If You Moved Right Next To Me Bro
A Gee Is What I Am, A JET Is Who I Be
You Know What I Smoke, And You Can't See Me
No Matter Where You Go, One Place You'll Never Be
Is Close Even If You Moved Right Next To Me Broo

And U Can't Do A Thing Bout It
Them Bitches Know The Planes Got It
And That Ain't Gone Change Im Sorry
