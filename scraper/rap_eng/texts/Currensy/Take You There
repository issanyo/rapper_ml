[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, clearly I made it, all of this hating
Show's over, it's a couple bad ones waiting
Tryna get chosen, flown to a exotic destination
Smoking on something as strong as my vivid imagination
I don't see nothing wrong with love being naked
Out this world whips, my crib a space station
My life is a trip, my crib a vacation

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
Bright lights, big city
Big cars, you and me
So baby you can roll with me
I'll show you how it's supposed to be

Big stars, I'll spot ya
Be calm, I got ya
So baby let me take you there
Baby, let me take you there

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yellow gold my link, Coca Cola my mink
Louie pouch holding that stink, love what you think I came without it?
Never that, I keep a pack of papers in my pocket
Applaud all my hot shit, in them hoes mouths like gossip
Money old as Lou Gossett, dollar clocker
Too late for doctors, this dead on arrival
Baby recognize G when it's in her eye, yo
Boss up nigga, this is what she ride fo'
Nigga fooling in that 2-0 Tahoe
Sunroof half open and my eyes halfway closed
It's a movie 'round here baby, might see somebody famous
Niggas getting change but we won't let it change us
Jet Life the campaign, can't stop the reign
Had to put the top up on the Vanquish

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I'm slanging raps off my iPad
Thinking back when High Times was a dime bag
We was smoking good, but it was all bad
Now we ride in that burgundy with the tan rag
If you ain't heard of me
A nigga guessin that your internet services ain't working too good at yall pad
It's all good, I'll hand y'all a late pass
Bring you up to speed 'fore we get to moving too fast
Back when I maneuvered that Jag hard top coupe
I just knew I was cooler than these lil' dudes out doing it
I was just being patient, pimping, perfecting my groovy
Sitting in the jacuzzi, on that Bluray Scarface
Nigga thinking 'bout music, while I'm ?
And my girl in the vanity mirror, wiping off Mac lip gloss
Finna roll up a doobie, sincerely yours truly
They can't do nothing with me, they can't do nothing to me

[Hook]
