[Verse 1]
Rainy nights, streetlights
Ideal situation for this presentation
PowerPoint, crumbling that flower to roll a joint
Disassemble your empire in an hour
Dissolve that shit if it don't involve my clique
We want all of this, coward quick throw in yo towel
You're not built, you not equipped
Fucker you might get kicked
You don't really stand that tall homie you on stilts
And when the real get revealed, oh man
That mask get pealed off, damn
You got a real issue on your hands
You got soldiers awaiting command
Getting in serious shit with bad leadership
That only leads to defeated cliques, defeated chips
And I ain't tryna see that shit
I gotta keep this circle of bosses really close nit
Homie and you know this

[Hook]
Smoking, reminiscing Tony coked up
Damn life fucked up even when you blow up
Late nights in my testarossa
Hope the po-po's, don't roll up on us
I don't know if they gone try and smoke us
In the club where gold diggers approach us
Thinking they gone try and come up on us
This shit ain't no different from your corners


[Verse 2]
Skyhigh, paper to the ceiling
Lord what is this feeling like a coke rush
And I'm drugging not dealing getting high of the thousand dollar band peeling
Hit a corner in my Impala
Three wheeling, parked it just to start a Ferrari
Heard some hoes is brokenhearted
But baby I'm sorry
I'm all about this money darling
Stuntin', ballin', all through New Orleans
You know that bitch wanna be where them stars is
Hundred thousand dollar cars is
Bars is laced with that raw, get a taste, you astonished
Hooked on it, totally lost in them murky waters where them sharks swim
Clown get drown while we forever on some don shit looking down
I'm on a yacht, Binoculars out
Islands I spot, we finna plot on it

[Hook]
Yeah, Smoking, reminiscing Tony coked up
Damn life fucked up even when you blow up
Late nights in my testarossa
Hope the po-po's, don't roll up on us
I don't know if they gone try and smoke us
In the club where gold diggers approach us
Thinking they gone try and come up on us
This shit ain't no different from your corners
