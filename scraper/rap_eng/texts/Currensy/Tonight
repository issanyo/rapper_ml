[Intro]
Ah! Lil Snupe nigga
Them hoes say I be whilin
I’m the hottest nigga up in freestylin

[Verse 1]
I do my motherfuckin thing
I’mma finally admit it, I’m the freestyle king
Hold up
And I got a show in a minute
Off the top for the show, look, see?
I got a show in an hour so you know I’m turnin up
Zips of the kush so you know I’m burnin up
I don’t wanna be the crazy man, that nigga fresh as fuck
With this dotty in my swisha and that lean up in my cup, but
Currently I’m jamming Curren$y
With this bad bitch, she don’t smoke but she gon burn with me
I ain’t never fucked er but she finna get a turn with me
Hit er with this missile, show er that the dick official
She ain’t got stripes but she blowin on my whistle
Finna dick er, ain’t gon miss er, got er here getting naked like a stripper
Young nigga swaggin, young nigga swaggin
I can’t even lie, Lil fuckin around with Dallas
Book me into town, then I’m finna shut it down
I’mma break all of my rounds, guaranteed we gon clown
But tomorrow bitch I gotta catch my flight
So you might as well go ahead and watch me shut it down tonight

[Hook]
Yea, a young nigga finna shut the whole fuckin city down here tonight
A young nigga really finna shut the whole fuckin city down tonight
We got Jet Life in this motherfucker
And we finna set it down tonight
Got DC in this motherfucker
And we finna shut it down tonight

(Verse 2-Curren$y)
La la la la la, nuff loot in my pocket, buy a car right now
Open season on trees, just closed on a house
Smoke out baby lungs, don’t come around
60’s drink Continental, root beer brown
Erk toes, I’m still down to earth holmes
Throw a nigga highway, pass the ozone
I could put you on to something strong
Plug you in like the charge on that iPhone
They’re my friends, they fly me in the way it’s grown, we get it in
Immaculately stoned, relaxing, get some dome
Plotting on the million, came at the same time I came up with a plane
How they gonna get it?
Split it with my niggas, right down the middle
Way too official, life for the livers
Tomorrow you gon hear about it but you know we did it

[Hook]
Yea, a young nigga finna shut the whole fuckin city down here tonight
A young nigga really finna shut the whole fuckin city down tonight
We got Jet Life in this motherfucker
And we finna set it down tonight
Got DC in this motherfucker
And we finna shut it down tonight
