[Intro]
Sledgren
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Smoking weed

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Keep goin'
More foreigns
World wide tourin'
Money pourin'
It's a blowout already but we still scorin'
Alley-oop it off the glass, shawty dunked on em
They still in there shaking ass and it's 4 in the mornin'
She in credit, she gone stay there as long as they throwin'
She don't care if they play ball or they break laws
Long as they break her off
I'm in my loft, presidential with 2 diamond bracelets on
Not doin' much, I'm just doin' my stuff
4 luxury trucks
Scoop my shooters up, and bring em through the cuts
Bound the same page, stay on game
Stay high, stay paid, stay the fuck out my way

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Yeah, riding in shit that you could never get
Sliding with a bitch that you could never hit
Dressed in some shit I know you could never find
I'm so happy I'm not on the other side

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
Tell them niggas man up
No we ain't tryna fuss, that's what the money for
I fucked the summer up, now I'm bout to do the same to winter
Know I keep that thing tucked, leave yo ass face down like a center
You think I'm [?], see my jewelry shining through the tint
The Glock hot, so I can't even go hit my lick
You switchin' sides, then make sure that you stay there my nigga
I'm riding round New Orleans with a car full of killers
Red dot, one shot, leave you DOA on the scene
Respect my mind, hope we make it hard for you to eat
Players call my phone, hate when they wake me out my sleep
This shit for life, J.L.R and SOG

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Yeah, riding in shit that you could never get
Sliding with a bitch that you could never hit
Dressed in some shit I know you could never find
I'm so happy I'm not on the other side
