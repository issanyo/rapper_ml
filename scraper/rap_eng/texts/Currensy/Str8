[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah
Ya’ll know
Turn me up some
We kill this shit
Turn it up some more that's cool
Rest in peace

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
From the beginning I was surrounded by killer niggas
Made me iller, life change in a split decision
You could get ended, finish cause N.O. niggas ig'nant
Like to get into shit, just to flex on your pistol grips
I done seen all of this, big figures reduce quick
Ya legendary they'll paint your face on them bricks
I just passed a mural dedicated to my dog
Niggas hated on 'em they ain't wanna see 'em ball
I think about Slim every time I'm in my car
Streets made me cultivated now i serve it to 'em raw
Underground star, my flow above par
Hotel suite bitch I'm forty floors above y’all
Feds searchin' they don't know where the drugs are
It's in the verses, they tryna x-ray the wall
I got two doobies in my bitch bra
Half a tank in my GTS-R
Where are y'all?

[Hook: Curren$y]
Straight game on a lil' nigga
You gotta do it how yo OG did it
Yeah, some of them fools seen't it from the window
But, some of them niggas was really in it
Yeah, straight game on these lil' niggas
Ugh, you gotta do it how yo OG did it
Yeah, some of them fools watched it from the windows
But, some of them real niggas was actually in it
Yeah, some of them real niggas was actually in it
Yeah, straight game on them lil' niggas

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
Straight game lil' nigga I'm a big dog
Chevy frame candy-painted in the front yard
Baby bottle sticky weed in the glass jar
Ain't nobody seen shit but everybody saw
In my city it's murder murder more money murder
Was playing curve on the same curb seen my first murder
Fuck a service I'm war ready I'm out here serving
Hand to hand, contact battle be 'bout that combat
What's that smell, bodies round 'em bullets and shells
I never dwell on my past cause i made it through Hell
Scars and bruises, shell shock niggas won't do me
But if they coming, I'll be waiting all by my lonely
And if I die tonight hoe, I won't go out like Tony
Rather It be from a crash than I'm wit California
Livin' fast die young, bury me wit the burner
And let them hoes pussy pop, on the hood of my hearse

[Hook: Curren$y]

[Verse 3: Fiend]
I'm in my Cement 3's
Grey surround the white like cocaine keys
We all after paper agree
We sang as we all leave notes, do re mi
'Til i sink in them Porsche seats
Won't stop me, triple low and such
DMV smoking Backwoods
While yours on the roller Dutch
Sports car gas pedal push 'em mac booker
You new and green to the game that's your ol' booker
This ain't a fiasco, no Donnie Brasco
Go where the cash go sometimes we assholes
Like when the cash, pistols and scales
It came off the jar wit a ride by the bell
New Beemers crispy as two zimmers
A few Tinas they all got big features
No creatures in a few miles
Don't sleep got bazookas for ??? aim at yo ???

[Hook: Curren$y]
