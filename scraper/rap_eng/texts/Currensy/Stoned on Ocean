[Intro: Curren$y]
We can handle this like Neanderthals
Or we can get into some player shit

[Hook: Curren$y]
Stoned on ocean
Rollin' up while I'm smokin'
Drinkin' while we still pourin'
Stoned on ocean
Rollin' up, we still smokin'
Drinkin' while we still pourin'

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Royal One Highâ€™s I copped today
Supposed to leave Miami tomorrow, but I'll probably stay
I got animals in my closet, plenty furs and snakes
Bakery bank, direct deposit, birthday cakes
Stack it, stash it; it's in the combination safe
Playbook exclusive; execute what's on each page
Pulled up next to you, I was smokin' in that Wraith
Your girl was tryin' to escape; you shoulda seen her face
Social media stampede over my next tape
Every thirty days, another shipment sent your way
Haters figure soon I will run out of shit to say
But I rhyme what I live, it's just my life is the shit
Sick selection; I got hella cars to whip
Kick collection; level straight marvelous
Jewelry disrespectful; my pinkie ring just called your chick, a bitch

[Hook: Curren$y]
Stoned on ocean
Rollin' up while we still smokin'
High, everything in motion

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Luxury bars gettin' thought off
Every time that I hear my Spyder start up
Underground stars, bruh; this grind was beyond tough
Would like to think them times beyond us
Smoked out till my time up
In the cut, somewhere, where you find us
With them lowriders lined up
Eastside, bruh, who I shine or
Who I three-wheel-motion that blue '65 for
This year in my city, shook down the House of Blues
It was a classy affair, I brung out Mack and Tune'
A lot of millionaires was highed up in one room
Fresh to death; my dressing room was King Tut's tomb, nigga

[Hook/Outro: Curren$y]
Stoned on ocean
Rollin' up while I'm smokin'
