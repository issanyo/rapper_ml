[Verse 1: Curren$y]
It's a Ferrari to her, to me that's my blue car
Simple shit with that, like riding at the Wal-Mart
Triple OG I roll them fat bat, ballparks
Homerun, back upstairs I gotta grab some more Raw
Papers now I'm skyscraper high, admiring the lines of one
Apollonia's body back in 1985
Purple Rain, on my window pane, drizzling a little
No, a lotta hash, 'fore you get that doobie all twisted
Mama, huh?
I'm too lifted up to hear ya, mama
Sound like you said you need a ride
Better call yo homegirl tell her come get you mama
Cuz I'm stuck like thumbtacks to posters
Posted, word to Trade I'm roasted
You know bitch
Use the phone or there's the door bitch, go bitch

[Hook: Curren$y]
And I can't lay up witcha, I'm on my paper mission
Mama you got me twisted, you'll have to report me missin'
I can't lay up witcha, I'm on my paper mission
Mama you got me twisted, you'll have to report me missin'
I can't lay up witcha, I'm on my paper mission
You'll have to report me missin'
I can't lay up witcha, I'm on my paper mission

[Verse 2: Kashflow]
It's a supercharged Z06
But it's faster than a ZR1
I'm Kashflow the God
These other niggas is fraud
I'm the [?]
On that hash oil, rooftop high with a tan broad
Back in '89 I woulda rode her on my handlebars
When I had that (dyno with the black mag, black mag)
Now we in that roller coaster 'Vette, I'm a Six Flags
Sixth ward niggas feature me all in my hashtags
Showin' off at car shows, I ain't even met a bitch
Maybach switching lanes, I ain't even steering it
Knew she was a freak just from her body when I gave her a hug
My younger niggas know I got it so I gave 'em a plug
Dip on a bitch quicker, than the hands of Bruce Lee
I put it in the socket, get it out before it shock me
Ain't no shockin' this G
And if the bitch still don't get it, I'ma tell em like Spitta
