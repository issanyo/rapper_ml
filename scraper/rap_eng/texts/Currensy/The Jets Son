(curren$y)
Bet you never met a nigga like me
Spitta came for the Nike's, these checks written off
Payed to the order of, he who resides in the high-rises
Above the city of crime, our music changin' their minds
Openen eyes, you witness history
I am the epitome, of a nigga doin' what he please and getting cheese Simultaneously
(non-understandable)
I got a million of 'em. Bet you out there, get the croud moving with any of them
Got them going, got 'em coming
Spitta revolving. dont go around, marry-go
Suckas marry hoes, and try to turn them into housewives
After the show, she into telling with us, she's surprised

(chorus)
Im doing my own thing, you should stop doing me
Just stay in your own lane, nigga get your swag right(2x)
Im doing my own thing, nigga get your swag right(4x)

(curren$y)
Gorilla in the mist, still on my Bape shit
Play with hoes in my Playcloths shout out to the Clipse, stroll through the mall
Stop for some chicks, took a couple pics
Asked whats up? same ole' shit
Oh so, play them old whips, you know how I roll
Chevy so fast, shawty's scared, ridin shotgun with her eyes closed
Niggas know I buy O's, like I'm on the Wheel of Fortune
Hope you get it, won't be too surprised if you didn't
Have to take a second listen, be my guest I ain't trippin
Women tell me you ain't like the other rappers, you different
Cause I don't put on a front, I put on for my city
I put my niggas on, and I put them on some bad bitches, YEA

(chorus)
Im doing my own thing, you should stop doing me
Just stay in your own lane, nigga get your swag right(2x)
Im doing my own thing, nigga get your swag right(4x)

(Dee Low)
You know how it go down when I come in this bitch, ya heard me
Walk like a pimp, nigga talk real dirty
Ladies love my boy like I'mma prince or something
So I just chill back and play with their tits or somethin
They dont mind, they be like "yo dee low" after the show
They like "can we come dee low?"
Nah give me your digits and ill give you a call
You know im all booked up, sorry ho
What do you expect, I'mma pimp, a balla' ho
You see the crew, you see the bong, you see the plane color floor
J-j-just watch us, I glow
If you Dee to the Low, me and spitta bout to take a trip to Tokyo

(chorus)
Im doing my own thing, you should stop doing me
Just stay in your own lane, nigga get your swag right(2x)
Im doing my own thing, nigga get your swag right(4x)
