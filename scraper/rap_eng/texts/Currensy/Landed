[Intro]
Yeah (yeah)
Yeah
It's like lounge trap music
Like lounge music
Like lounge music
Lounge music, trap music
That could be toured at the casino with Wayne Newton
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
They say I'm not from this planet
Shit going just how I planned it
Put loot away for the families
Stacking my bread like a sandwich
Saving my face from them cameras
Situations could get scandalous
When niggas feel like they embarassed

[Verse 1]
Your bitch fucking niggas for status
Bruh, that's the one you should be mad with
That's a Panamera not a Camry
With cranberry leather fabrics
Front the valet flashing hazards
In the lobby bar smoking gasses
My watch worth twice what your advance is
Don't try to play me on no rap shit

[Hook]
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
They say I'm not from this planet
Everything going how I planned it
Put loot away for the family
Stacking up bread like a sandwich
Saving my face from them cameras
Cause situations could get scandalous
When niggas feel like they embarassed

[Verse 2]
I used to live in Miami
Fall asleep stoned on the balcony
Me and my homie smoke rapper weed
I'm the one coined the phrase "rapper weed"
I'm the one, fuck it, we ain't gon' get into that
You can smell the shit strong and it's still in the vacuum pack
Woke up this morning said told myself "Self it's time to go get the bag"
Wouldn't have went to sleep that night used a half a million as a pillow yeah
Wouldn't have said it, if I weren't with it
I don't play it like them sucker niggas
In a matter of minutes gon' get it
In a couple more I'm showing up in it

[Hook]
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
They say I'm not from this planet
Shit going just how I planned it
Put loot away for the family
Stacking my bread like a sandwich
Saving my face from the cameras
Situations could get scandalous
When niggas feel like they embarassed
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
You ain't never seen this, they don't know what this about
Might not ever be released, they just want me to try it out
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
Bitch I ain't pull up, I landed
You ain't never seen this, you don't know what this about
Might not ever be released, they just want me to try it out

[Outro]
Put a lil away for the family
Staying away from them cameras
That's a Panamera not a Camry
