[Hook: Mary Gold]
And we roll up in the El Camino
Cruising down south in the El Camino
Light one up in the El Camino
And we roll up in the El Camino
So as we riding by
So as we riding by
So as we riding by

[Verse: Curren$y]
Uh, mama please, twist the trees
While I get dressed and look for car keys
Start to crank V8, 350 quickly in the breeze like piling
Got yo allergies wilding
Sneeze cause the nigga so cold when he roll
Forgiato, three-piece gold
Not everybody to do it, not everybody thatâ€™s fluent
And that money talk, Spitta a killa
I should write these lyrics in crime scene chalk
Now take a walk on the side where the jets reside
Stay high, stay fly, always ready to ride
Ice cream paint job, smelling like weed on the inside
No question, Chevrolet my obsession
Every month I gotta get one, this check will cop my next one
Corvette selection, Monte Carlo collection
But that El Camino classic perfection
Bitches always looking in his direction

[Hook: Mary Gold]
