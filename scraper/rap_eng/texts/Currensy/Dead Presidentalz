(Verse 1: Curren$y)
Figured it's time that I step back from the game
And peep it from a coach's point of view
So I can see how niggas went wrong and how the players was grown
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit
The line of scrimmage is wicked
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick
Drop back like a all star QB
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry
Looking for vehicles and accessories
Like I do, and every representor of my crew
I get love from Cuz and the Piru
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese
Let the windows down and let the purp' scent clear out
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out
But I'm on to 'em
Spray the chronic-killer and talk calm to 'em
"Good day officer, what's the problem?
You looking for answers? I don't got none"
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga

(Lil Wayne talking)
Ha ha, I know thats right
Hello World, Yeah, Yeah
Uh Huh, Music 2 Fly 2 comin soon y'all

(Verse 2: Lil Wayne)
You can see me on the, Eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch
Fuck the world make it walk with a leg twitch
Flow retarded, I'm on some special ed shit
The magnificent twist it like a dread bitch
And I can get up in the car and drive
And if the record ain't a smash, I can still survive
Yeah, money ain't a thing but everything to me
Shit, I gotta make them C-notes sing to me
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats
And, I am just a player in this game we beat
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet
Passin' all day up Latoya's Street
Back when Scarface used to sing to me
Had me feeling like a G was the thing to be
Back when I was pedaling my ten-speed bike
Who knew I'd be pedaling the six-speed white
Big dog through the yard where the little dogs bite
So if you are female dog, you don't fight
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master
Rich ass nigga...
