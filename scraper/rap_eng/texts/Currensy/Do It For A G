[Verse 1: Curren$y]
You shoulda seen how I pulled up (pulled up)
Your girl got an instagram clip
15 seconds ain't enough
We talkin' bout a mothafuckin' feature film

And I heard you was mad at us
Well, wait until you get a load of this
Rally stripes center one
Scratched off like a lottery ticket
Yeah me and your bitch
Marijuana and liquor
Her favorite
Mama got good sense but her head game crazy
She on the bed like a stripper stage goin' in
She bust it open like a SLS Mercedes

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Do it for a G
Do it for a G
Do it for a G
All I wanna be, is all that I could be
All that I could be, that's why they fuck with me

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Do it for a 'G' or B-A-N-D-Z
Got an AK watchin' out for the FBI
Try'na be F-R-E-E
Do it for the OG niggas in the cutlasses
Old school Chevy and the hustlin'
AR-15, [?], SK bustin' it... Blaat!
Got them hoes on deck, Got them hoes on deck
Got the Benz and Porsche got the white Rolls Royce
And the doors on that, Go!
Opposite, I'm the opposite
I'm type of G nigga, ain't no stoppin' it

[Chorus: Curren$y]

[Interlude : Curren$y]
Comin' down, papered up
They make em way for us, they know we holdin' now
I made a plan to be the man
Go and get it that money ain't gon' wait around
Comin' down, papered up
They make em way for us, they know we holdin' now
I made a plan to be the man
Real money only bosses in my circle when you look around

[Chorus: Curren$y]
