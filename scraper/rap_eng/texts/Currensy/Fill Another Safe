[Intro]
Wanna say free C-Style

[Verse 1]
Some of your homies wasting space not carrying their weight
Smiling in your face while wishing they can take your place
What you do? Keep them niggas in the loop
What they do? Sit in the dark and plot on you
Game of Thrones this winter, rainy and cold this is known
Highed up mind blown to cope with living in this war zone
Smoking for the soldiers who ain’t going home
Some journeys you must make alone
But I lit this gas for you my nigga
Fueled for the paper mission driven to go and get it
Slept on me woke up to me in a Bentley diaper shitted not tinted
Recognize a legend was sitting in it
Commit that image to memory
Fresh to death still living
Reminiscing Iceberg Slim and his eight women
Not that camera pimpin I was never with
I ran with the realest I know every step I take I represent ‘em
Couldn’t see another way
Fuck it fill another safe my nigga

[Chorus]
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
We got money put away
We got more money on the way
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe

[Verse 2]
Fuck it fill another safe
Made a heavy bag today
And I ain’t even hit the stage I just walked through the club and waved
Sat in the VIP section with my set and I got blazed
Joints of my own strain not confused, super dazed
But I see through the haze directly to the fetti
Stack it up Andretti bout money I ain’t never played
This is serious business I don’t joke about digits
Rubber bands round them bitches
Stacked up where we can fit em
Bury some under the building
Bury some under the backyard right by the attack dog
Put some in the wall homie I know we’ll never fall we still ball
We right back the next day
Fuck it fill another safe

[Chorus]
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe
We got money on the way
We got money put away
Fuck it fill another safe
Fuck it fill another safe yea
