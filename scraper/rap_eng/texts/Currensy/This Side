[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day, catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Raised in the ways of G's on this side
Hustle all day catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Was raised in the ways of G's on this side

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Papers up niggas plotting, bitches watching
Dollars clocking, ballers spotting, seen me hop in
Impala's dropping out the sky
Or so it seems cuz I got em out my crib in line by the 3's
Nigga this is me, all I could ever be
All I could ever give you when I'm on these beats
Now I ease my way in the game avoiding the fleas
Big dog though when I scratch, I'm talking bout them G stacks
Triple OG sacks get lit, then tracks get ripped
Firing like pump pistol grips, blood on the bricks
Wash it off then sell that shit
Oh there's a boss in the midst, can't you smell his scent
You see a shark fin moving toward a feed of fish
Tuck it or you won't be leaving with it
Uh, you see a shark fin moving toward a feed of fish
Oh you done stepped into some dealer shit

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day, catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Raised in the ways of G's on this side
Hustle all day catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Was raised in the ways of G's on this side

[Verse 2: C-Style]
Uh, block clicking got them chickens and them Desert Eag's
Ten speed, before I ever whipped a V
I'm on the East with my G's in the trenches
Rep long like trenches
Bending corners on them inches
Nigga this is the life that a lot of niggas kill fo'
Ya boys hating they all still broke
Get to the money nigga, what the fuck you think we here fo'
Aw shit nigga, here we go, peep the scenario
Pick ups and drop offs right in front the corner store
Overtime, on my grind gotta get the dough
Done seen a little now I want more
Going hard til they kick the door
I need a new coupe, a bad bitch with a Beyonce hair-do
G'd up at all times you know how I do
Left side when I ride, Harvey Blue

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Hustle all day, catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Raised in the ways of G's on this side
Hustle all day catch stunts at night
Momma say the way us niggas living ain't right
And any other way wouldn't really be life
Was raised in the ways of G's on this side
