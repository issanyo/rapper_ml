[Intro]

[Hook]
Nights like This I Wish
To ride Low In The chevy hit a switch
In the city burning killer with a bitch
Mirror mirror on the wall call me the shit [X2]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I'm
Creeping up on ya' bending corners
That reefer aroma, strong as ammonia
But we keep it on us
Niggas is no longer important
You had your moment
But we still smoking
Season is open on duck ass niggas who don't know what the code is
If the g's brung' you up then you would have known this
Now witness the coldest
Now I'm rolling my own shit
Ownership, owning this, owning that
Park them cars in the back cause them hoes know your whip
Identified by what you drive
The streets don't have a face but it has ears and eyes
And sharp muhfuking teeth it will eat your ass alive
Living dangerously high this hustle is a drug
This game is a bitch the only one I love

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Yup, yup. I’m in a stupid clean Chevy, whole top glassed out
Me & Spitta hopped off in a super sport & smashed out
Catch me on the next flight, high, living that Jet Life
My pockets got an appetite that make the pussy pop tonight
Loud pack bought a pound at the Jet Lounge
Hater running all about my trunk shaking the whole ground
I’m in the city, burning killa with a bitch
Drop the top & make a wish, roll it up & get them chips
Big wheels, deep dish, painted with the chrome lip
Purple, what I pour sip, shake that ass & make it flip
Wasn’t for them dollars, big paper, burning wheels
She took it all off, everything except them heels
I got a pint & I’m bout to pop the seal off it
She like that action, I'mma pass around & let her toss it
Now what you know about the classics with the motor in it?
454’s, Superchargers with rubber spinning
Pimp tight, dirty Sprite, LED headlights
The way she bounce it up & down, be outta sight
Burning paper, back to back, on that foreign smoke
We taking off, so take a seat, now have a toast
Mirror mirror on the wall, I'mma ball & I'mma score
I'mma get that dough & after that I'mma fuck a ho
Put me in the game, let me show you how to do this shit
Diamonds gripping up against wheel when I hit the strip

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tiny C]
Uh, Oh Gees Niggas ain't Fucking With My Team
I made It past 25 so I'm a OG
Once I Clear a Million Dollars I'm Pass The Blow the Whole P
Ridin' Brand New Seats still covered in Plastic
Rims with the beat i call that a Mix and Master
Closer too my dreams when they come to getting Gwopale
Bet that i throw it,  you can hear me from a block away
4-12’s in the trunk, got the chevy beating stupid
Thinking should i Four door it today or should I coupé it
New or old school it
The Homies in the Hood say i be fooling
Three Eighty Three stroker on gangsters i be moving
Posi in the rear equipped with the dual exhaust
Pull up on me at the Lights and you gone take a Loss
Cause where i come from its Survival of the Fittest
Long Beach,  East Side all i move with is Hittas
