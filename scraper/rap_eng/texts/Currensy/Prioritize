[Verse 1]
Raised lettering on my Hoosiers
Drag strips slicks rear of the Barracuda
Them niggas ain't shit, just mothafuckin' poo-poo
Sissy-ass zero, mothafuckin' fruit loops
Homie, who your hero? Who taught you your moves?
Z'ed in my limo, woke up in my hotel room
Hoes just following they noses, to my door
It's no joke, momma just roll this
You can hit it after my lil brother say he straight
You gon' get your turn on the doobie bitch just wait, no beginner luck
Coming from me, this is just fate because I had faith certain
I can make it shake, like turbulence
Sweet sugar babies all sleeping in my nursery
Walk in, suckas go to shuffling, nervously
Won't stop 'til I reside at the top permanently
21 joints burning for me

[Hook]
And if you ain't got no rims, nigga
Don't get no wood grain steering wheel
But you can lay back, let your paper stack
Instead of going into overkill, pay your fuckin' beeper bill bitch

[Verse 2: Nesby Phips]
This is to them niggas that think this shit is sweet
I guess it is, hah? Cause I'm in first class, making beats
Sipping cranberry, no liquor, deboard the plane
Hoes stop me for a picture, I ain't tripping
Even tho I'm a fall back nigga, but that's how it is
When your crew on buzz, people do show love
Fall thru, and all my town niggas do roll bud
But leave them blunts in your car, cause we don't do those cuz
That's a mean pair of kicks, kudos love
Now she, cooking me breakfast after lusting me for dinner
Figure she won't lose cause she fuckin' with a winner
I told her game over to reset, press Enter

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mission Impossible: completed
Obstacles are optical illusions
We don't really see 'em, they put rules in place
Cause y'all need 'em, some people are like sheep
I got no mercy for the weak
Especially when niggas next to me and ready to eat
I put 'em in position to get them, I'm getting me
Louisana traveler twistband, looking for my music
Is bringing listeners under the ground like quicksand
Kawasaki ninja on the kickstand, any minute I'm outty
Like four rings, truth in engineering ya got me
Bitches longing to be by me, hypnotic karate
Talk that dress right off of her body
She so wet, she soggy from these verbal massages
Highed up, astrologist, smoking with your goddesses
Swore that I would do all of this

[Hook]
