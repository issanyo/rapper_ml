[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, right back like I left my cell phone in the sofa cushion
Pay attention to 'em, show you how a pro do it
To the edge I push it, clearing over the ledge
Long way from down there so don't look if you're scared
On the quest for the bread, like I'm trying to build a sandwich
Tall enough to put me next to the moon if I was to stand on it
That's all, you niggas sugary, get caught in the rain and dissolve
Reinforced frame, now Spitta too strong
Sucka niggas ain't built to last that long
They out of ammunition making whack ass songs
Rap ain't wrong, it's just fucked up, not like that forever though
Because you got us, good weed, bad bitches among us
Try not to let this bullshit become us
We the Jets, my nigga only God is above us

[Hook: Curren$y]
Crusin' in my 'lac with a diamond in the back
Bad bitch in the passenger seat she twistin' up a sack
I know this ain't the seventies, I'm feeling like the Mac
Goldie, you can't hold me from collecting these stacks

Full steam ahead, no time for looking back
While I was off you niggas was getting fat
It's my time boss I need parts of all that
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Heavens to Betsy somebody catch me, I'm fallin'
Hopefully I land on both Jordan's
Get right back to the sky with another bong rip
Another broken celly maybe I should buy a phone clip
Stop it, I would never rock it
Like my wallets, my money and my rubbers all in my pockets
You already know what's in them Louie pouches
It's prescribed so I ride with at least a couple ounces
Never seen lions pouncin' on their prey
Real shit, that's how I approached the beat today
These, niggas is slippin', butterfingers going to the bar
Don't leave your broad you better bring her with you boy
Or you'll be filing a missing person report for her
Picture on a milk carton at the Krogers
Winn-Dixie or whoever your local grocery freezer
If I didn't think I would lose my account I would of U Streamed her

[Hook: Curren$y]
Crusin' in my 'lac with a diamond in the back
Bad bitch in the passenger seat she twitstin' up a sack
I know this ain't the seventies, I'm feeling like the Mac
Goldie, you can't hold me from collecting these stacks

Full steam ahead, no time for looking back
While I was off you niggas was getting fat
It's my time boss I need parts of all that
If I ain't on my grind then what you call that
