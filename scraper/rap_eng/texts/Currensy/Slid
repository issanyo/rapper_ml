[Intro: Talking]
It's nothing new
Though it might be to you

[Part 1]
Check how I sit
Check how I sit
Check how I slid
Thats what I did
Thats what I did
Caught them stunts on a bitch
Caught them stunts on a bitch
Caught them stunts on a bitch
Left 'em sick
They said I'm sick
Oh shit

[Part 2: Verse]
Pulled up tough
Old school spaceship coupes luxury trucks, yup
And they knew it was up
Floozers choosing to rush, stumbling over ducks
Smart bitches waited on the real then we appeared
It took a couple years baby ask 'em where I been
All her life I told her I been tryna wrestle down the mills
She on them pills got her rolling like wheels
We swung a L then I shot back to my crib
Life is a movie who's the star and who's shooting?
Live action for dead presidents if it don't make sense
It make dollars and I'm all about it
Rolex watches for all my partnas we all poppin'
Rolex watches for all my partnas we all poppin'
And I ain't buy them fools shit baby we all clockin'

[Outro]
Yea
Check how I slid
