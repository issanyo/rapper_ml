I'm wit' you bro
I fuck with this record
I just want homie to brush up on his Biggie
He need to respect Biggie, that's all
But I fuck with this record right here

Ain't gonna waste no time
We'll just do it

[Verse]
Shooter out the roof
Pick out a coupe
Im'ma get two
One of 'em for you
Fuck it, it's cool
Ain't nuttin' but loot
Ain't nuttin' but chains, son
I got more where that came from
And I been catchin' the same stunts
Lately been pullin' that Wraith up
Me and Tish in a 'Rari late nights
Swervin' that bitch like a racecar
It feel good to be caked up
Money wadn't always straight, bruh
I used to have to wait, bruh
I used to have to wait for it
Now I don't fuck with no lists
I see it, I want it, I'm in it that day, bruh
That's a six-trey, there's a six-four
Another six-four, there's a six-five
I got a lot more
That's a ninety-six
I got three a'dem
And a sixty-eight on the way, bruh
Chrome all on the sway bar
What you say dog?  Wait

Shooter out the roof
Pick out a coupe
Im'ma get two
One of 'em for you
Fuck it, it's cool
Ain't nuttin' but loot
Ain't nuttin' but chains, son
I got more where that came from
Lately been catchin' the same stunts
And I been pullin' that Wraith up
Me and Tish in a 'Rari late nights
Swervin' that ho like a racecar
Yeah, it feel good to be caked up
Money wadn't always straight, bruh
I used to have to wait, bruh
I used to have to wait for it
Now I don't fuck with no lists
I see it, I want it, I'm in it that day, bruh
That's a six-trey, there's a six-four
Another six-four, there's a six-five
I got a lot more
That's a ninety-six
I got three a'dem
And a sixty-eight on the way, bruh
Chrome all on the sway, bruh
Your bitch got a room at the A loft
She want me to come fuck her head off
I'm countin' up like a straight boss
I cain't afford to take a break for her
Baby girl, gimme a couple hours
I need to smoke
And then I need to take a shower
Then I need to smoke
For some more hours
'Cause you know I got a love affair with flowers
Concentrate they high power
I know you don't fuck with that
This shit is the truth
Might make you think of "Fly"
You might try to jump off the roof
Bitch, look at you

Yep
