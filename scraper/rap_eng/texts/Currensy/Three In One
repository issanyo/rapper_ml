[Verse 1: Curren$y]
In the villa, bitches with him
One chillin', one in the kitchen, pots whippin'
Cops sniffin', must be kiddin', stop trippin'
The dogs didn't get the scented, was in the lyrics
That's how I hit it, pulled up in it, three piece rimmed it
Straight shitted, they was mad, said it was rented
Them hateful niggas should congratulate a player
And ask him, how he did it
So then they could get it
But instead rather talk down on the bread
Fuck 'em, dog, and keep stuntin', that's how I play it
See how I slid, safe home plate, I broke your bitch
We spent your grip, furnished my other place
Dog, you should see it
Hope mama never slip
And say my name while she sleepin', next to this lame
Clue him in to our hustle, we fleeced him
She spent it all on a boss and I ain't even need it
I had her buyin' Gucci pieces for my youngest nieces
Bitch, keep your secrets

[Hook: Curren$y]
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
I send hits, it's done quickly
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
I send for 'em, they come to get me

[Verse 2: TY]
Look, you don't show no love
It ain't nothin' for me to get another plug
Got a couple bitches on a couple drugs
With some young niggas that'll fuck you up
Yeah, and I don't know what's luck
Cause I bust my ass and work hard as fuck
Few people like me, few people don't
Shit, it got me feelin' like Donald Trump
Get caught, better seal it up
They in my circle, then they real as fuck
Young nigga, I'm a live it up
Real fly shit, it's not many of us
'Bout money, you can hit my line
Clean my guns when I'm sittin' inside
Jet Life, we never die
Why you think these niggas wanna switch sides?
Yeah, and you fake thugs who be showin' all of that fake love
I'm a pull your bitch when she up in the club
In that Monte Carlo, sittin' on the dubs
Yeah, on that Eastside, smokin' hella weed with my OG
You talk strong, but your hustle weak
Three bitches in the Bentley
Yeah, I done made a way
Just so for all my niggas, now they gettin' cake
Stay down and just keep it real
Before you know it, you'll be at a mill
Grind don't stop, work all day
Bag on bag with no delay
All my role models pushed weight
So I got to keep racks on me

[Hook: Curren$y]
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
I send hits, it's done quickly
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
Three bitches in that black Bentley
I send for 'em, they come to get me
