[Curren$y]
We lit
The dogs asleep
My dog left and put together a motherfucking masterpiece
That shit rhymed but that was unintentionally
So did that but I can't apologize
You already know what we about to get into
Critically acclaimed
Internationally accepted
Universally respected
My dog settle for less
The steak and shrimp pimp
First time I sat in an eldorado was with my brother
First time I rolled on real gold and elbows was with my brother
So I figured, you know, it would be cool if I smoked a joint
And talked some shit at the beginning of his
At the beginning of his
Motion picture debut, because you can see this music
Smoke a little bit more of this joint before I get out the way
I got cars to drive
LE$ got dope to cook
Matter fact
