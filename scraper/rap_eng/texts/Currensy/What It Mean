*The Cannon*

[Hook: Curren$y](x2)
What it mean to you?
It mean the world to me
You get out what you put in
And I give it everything
Diamond crowns on me now
Because I am a king
On my terrace being ready
In case they come for me

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
I cain't lie
I be thinking about blowing cheese
Putting another Ferrari on Canal St
If it's flashy, foreign, in New Orleans
It's for me
I park it on the sidewalk
Let everybody see
Tell my lil ones
They can get cars colder than this
Put em on they learn it
So they recognize G
You could do more than I done
You got a chance to stunt harder than I stunt

[Hook: Curren$y](x2)
What it mean to you?
It mean the world to me
You get out what you put in
And I give it everything
Diamond crowns on me now
Because I am a king
On my terrace being ready
In case they come for me

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
I got some shit on my mind, baby
Roll up hella weed
They shot my partner down
Over some old beef
Rest in peace, homeboy
You was buried a G
Though you never died
Keep your name in the street
I don't text and drive
Girl, you better call me
You shoulda told me that shit
When you saw me
We a Navy
Better yet an Army
Better yet an Air Force
A mother fucking star fleet

[Hook: Curren$y](x3)
What it mean to you?
It mean the world to me
You get out what you put in
And I give it everything
Diamond crowns on me now
Because I am a king
On my terrace being ready
In case they come for me

[Outro: Curren$y]
What it mean to you?

Diamond crowns on me now
Because I am a king
On my terrace being ready
In case they come for me
