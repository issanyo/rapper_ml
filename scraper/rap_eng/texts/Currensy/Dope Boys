[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's some hoes that wanna come through
They was with Chris Brown yesterday
Meek had 'em the day before
It's all good with me, I ain't trippin'
Them hoes probably fucked Snoop too, you know what I'm sayin'?

[Curren$y]
Yeah, ladada
Dope boys cop clean cars with the dirty money
Ladadada

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
All my homes spacious, all the hoes patient
All gold Daytons, on the road to Vegas
Dope boys get it, DGK fitted
You just wanna finesse her, I already hit it
Fly you out to visit, flight miles only
Chevrolet exquisite, dry cloth only
Lighters on the dresser, baddest bitches step up
Pull off at the car wash as I throw the set up
Young jetsetters, Jet Life feathers
All my niggas hover as the snakes slither
I got the eagle eye, 40-Eagle out (tell 'em)
Smoke and dab with her, I let you eat 'em out
That boy still a player, season ticket holder
Niggas hatin' on me, I'm the only Swisher rollin'
You know I got it
(Wassup nigga, Wiz wassup?! Curren$y!)
I'm the only Swisher rollin'

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Rat racer
Don Julio, no chaser
Green door vapors as we count paper
Thinkin' 'bout another way, finna light a jay
Tryna convince my brother to put them K's away
He like, "uh, lil bro, no way"
Them niggas play too many games in the streets today
You could be slain for pay
Fucked up in years, it couldn't be 'bout scratch
Some niggas really hate, they don't be flyin' straight
I'm just watch shopping, picking out a new date
Just rich nigga problems
Rich niggas got her naked on a island, body like a bottle
Slapped her on the bottom
Box Chevy squattin'
The one I dropped her off at her house in
Two Bentleys, seven low-riders and a suspended license
Hella paper I'm stackin'
Shit wasn't always like this

[Hook]
Dope boys cop clean cars with the dirty money [x2]
Every night up and down the block, passing right in front me [x2]
Took a toll on me, molded me as a youngin' [x2]
Back against the wall, what more could you want from me? [x2]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
I gotta have it, grabbin' it, stack it
I gotta see it, smokin' weed keep me thinkin' to never sleep in
Haze chiefin', lazy eye, I'll still peep it
Caught it before the car was even started
I'm not a target, I'm a shark bitch, boss shit
You will get squashed beneath my feet hoe, I'm enormous
The real don shit, you just a dunce, done
Dump blunt guts, I'm out catching stunts
Moon roof, bubble top, '61, what you want
Ace, paper plates, well done
Paper chase, bank race, Spitta won
First place, killing shit, smoking gunk
Clear this face, out of space
Benz coupe, model and make
Some new shit they can't pronunce
Haters don't know what to say
But anyway...
