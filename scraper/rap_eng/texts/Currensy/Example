[Intro]
Yeah
And
Where..
Haven't..
We been yet
Uh
They look up to the Jets
Can't stop the planes
Nigga you can't do a thang

[Verse]
Uh machete sharp
My dreams realized, the Ferrari's horse
Global domination ruling my thoughts
Never let 'em play you
Fuck 'em sideways, always until they pay you
Reimbursement for paid dues
The money made me move
Running thru my shoes
For the day that I can kick 'em off, relax
I said I'd quit smoking these beats but I relapsed
We heard yo shit and we laughed
That bitch saw that herb you twisting and she passed
She rather see me make that 6-4 lean back
Flow hippy, comfortable bean bags, chill
I tell you a secret if you can keep it shhhh, real
Sucker ass niggas cooking all kind of bullshit
Succotash all stuck to the dishes
Wonder why I won't eat with ya
Boss tha fuck up, be somethin', nigga
I am an example of what can happen when you quit being afraid to gamble
Shook the dice and rolled
When niggas like you would have stayed shook and froze
I get busy, yeaauh
You think you know, you ain't sure

Fool...
