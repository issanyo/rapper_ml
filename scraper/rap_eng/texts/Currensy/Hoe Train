[Intro: Curren$y]
Shit easy to say, harder to do

[Curren$y]
Uh, She say the paper ain't the issue
Well, why is even being mentioned?
I don't know at all, it's just my first time living
Figuring this shit out with ya
Say you fell for me, you walk through hell for me
I think you're only here for the mail, honey
What would you do if it all fell through?
Are you sure that I could lean on you?
I got a feeling you'll be with some other dude
On to something new, while I'm hustling, reconstruction shit
I can never totally trust a bitch, never
And I'm cursed to live like this forever
So I only love you when we physically together
I'm sure that all my notions are correct ones
Me and you kinda got a bad connection
Time is precious, why would you waste another second playing
Is you trying to get paid?
Sways, headliner suede, candy painted blades
On to the next mind game and that's a god damn shame
But the conductor won't stop the hoe train, mane

Easy to say, harder to do
All aboard
