[Hook: French Montana]
On it, your bitch calling
Said she on the pill and she rolling, dawwwg
She want it all night long
Straight cash, all I want
Them doors go up on that Lam'
Bitch could suck it off with no hands
She want me spend this cash, I won't
I just hit that pussy, now I'm gone

[Verse 1: French Montana]
Too much going to think about
I just need some good head, baby think it out
I slam doors on your favorite whores
Niggas lost and won, some niggas won and lost
Can't run, nigga pray
Toast up for my niggas, make a milli' off a yay
Them nightmares come true fast
Shining on your T.V. nigga, newsflash
School of hard knock, pocket all knots
In that small box, making young niggas roll fast
Montana, fast money witcha' slow ass
You fuck niggas stinking with your old ass
What's in my pocket is your Whole stash
I'm riding slow, these niggas talking fast
Rolling
Nigga popped a pill and I'm rolling

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Six hundred a bottle, bring ten
No sparklers, too much attention, drawing stalkers
Bitches be fishing for ballers
I'm bossing, New Orleans, Ferraris, Bentleys
To Monte Carlos, El Caminos, Impalas
Disappearing with your broad at three in the morning
Penthouse, hotel room cards
Big dog, underground rap star, I can't lay down too long baby
Plus I know your man's at home going crazy
And in my world you know the game ain't waiting
For no nigga putting pussy before papers
So repair your make-up, and have your alibi made up
I hate to be the reason you and old boy breakup
I wake up, bake up
Night time, smoke the stage up
Counting cake up
Good time all mine
Montana, Andretti coke wave
Jet Life

[Hook]
