[Chorus: Succeed]
I wake up in the morning
Twist a cone and light that bitch and get to zoning
I know the money coming in
I could feel it every time a nigga run that shit
And I done made a way
And you can't tell me nothing get the fuck up out my face
Yo this that Jet Life
So ain't no hesitating baby ain't no thinking twice

[Verse 1: T.Y.]
Bitch we ball for them rounds and all the flashiest things
Hoes be out of they mind when I get 'em out they brain
Forever Jets over bitches, way more than a saying
This game will eat you alive, you better watch how you play it
I'm a son of a gangsta, you a son of a busta
Spitta gave me the go, so it's a must that I crush ya
I don't like feeling that mediocre vibe from you suckas
That's enough to make a nigga wanna ride and just pluck ya
Take your bitch to the crib, get her high and then fuck her
She been heard bout the kid so she been dying to fuck me
And these stupid ass niggas always lying 'bout something
All these niggas wanna shine but ain't rhyming bout nothing
I was born a hustler so it's in my blood
And it's about right now, don't give a fuck what it was
Cause, everybody gon' talk that shit
But everybody in this world ain't gon' accomplish it

[Chorus: Succeed]
I wake up in the morning
Twist a cone and light that bitch and get to zoning
I know the money coming in
I could feel it every time a nigga run that shit
And I done made a way
And you can't tell me nothing get the fuck up out my face
Yo this that Jet Life
So ain't no hesitating baby ain't no thinking twice

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh, suede Adidas, silver screen double features
Two movie screen divas got doobie fever
At the stall wagging beg for me to meet 'em
Bong 'em, Rice Krispie treat 'em
Blazed, laid, left 'em naked in the shade
More ways to get paid occupying my brain
Can't take it to the grave so while I'm here Imma play
Ain't nothing wrong if my back bumper grind on my hard top '65
Cruise Life on mine
The crew strong 20 low riders in a line
Outside mother fucker you can't hide
Lights off when it's on
How many yo' folks gon' ride?

[Chorus: Succeed]
I wake up in the morning
Twist a cone and light that bitch and get to zoning
I know the money coming in
I could feel it every time a nigga run that shit
And I done made a way
And you can't tell me nothing get the fuck up out my face
Yo this that Jet Life
So ain't no hesitating baby ain't no thinking twice
