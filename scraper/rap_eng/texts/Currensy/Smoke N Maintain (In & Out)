This is just a small introduction to the jet-set era
Every mornin' I wake up I take a look in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryna' be like me
But I don't mind it to be honest
Just as long as they pay homage
Earned my spot, I one of New Orleans' flyest rhymers
I make a faithful house-wife into a two-timer
Snuck a eighth on the Island in my Bape jacket linin'
Not fired up, we flyin above
Niggas claimin' to get higher than us
They lyin' to ya
In front my bitch crib waitin' for Lil Roddy to pull up
Got a joint to bake but I'm a keep it trill and wait
Cos the homey called and said that he was on his way
Just another day in the life, another minute another mile
On the flight. No, I wouldn't switch it for nothin', dig it?
Yeah I might of said it before
But I'mma say it til the mic tell me don't say it no more
