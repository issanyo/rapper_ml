[Verse 1: LG]
Get the money, count the scratch, I stay on my grind
I rap about the paper cause that's what's been on my mind
I'm very smart, but I gotta be in the state of mind
To put it on your ass if you try to fuck with mine
It's dangerous in this battlefield but I'm still thuggin'
No trust a soul cause I feel like niggas be up to somethin'
Noddin' and duckin', thinkin' while I'm constantly puffin'
If you 'bout it, say you 'bout it, is you real or you bluffin'?
Cause you ain't really 'bout that drama
Hot lid'll fry your ass like Filipino bombers
I'm on the west coast, vaca with my Bahama mamas
Givin' her the best stroke, they lovin' her in no persona
Climb on this jet though, perfecto, my clothes designer
Inhale this best smoke, that chest smoke, that marijuana
That marijuana
And I'mma just smoke that best smoke, that marijuana

[Hook: LG]
It's dangerous in this battlefield but I'm still thuggin'
No trust a soul cause I feel like niggas be up to somethin'
It's dangerous in this battlefield but I'm still thuggin'
No trust a soul cause I feel like niggas be up to somethin'

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
High as I is
Flyer than whatever the air force'll ever build
In the streets, may the force be with you, little niggas hungry
Plottin' to get you trickin', you with bitches, this is a warning
Being delivered, Jet Life scriptures written beneath palm trees
Jottin' down pictures, help you see how I'm livin'
Good morning, draw back the drapes, let the sun shine in
The game was dark and good as fuck 'til son and them got in
What else to do, but count money, ride them cars in front them clubs
I'm callin' them hoes bitches and smokin' my weed up
G'ed up, swung through in that coupe, I scored your bitch and then dipped
1-0 we up, you through, nigga who? Say huh?
Supposed to be mad, come see us, but wait in line
Me and my money spendin' some quality time
I met her, we fucked on the first day
We both fell in love, then we got married in a bank, girl
