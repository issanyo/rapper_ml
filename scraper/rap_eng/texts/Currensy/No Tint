I ride around with no tint
I ride around with no tint
I ride around with no tint
So all them bitches can see me
Them dudes muggin' me
I'm not trippin', I ain't never gotta hide from a nigga

Hot Spitta that nigga, you already know
Flew to Jacksonville and bought a J-Ville Chevy, hoe
Rode a motherfucker clean back to the N.O
My nigga Dip said he had a lick on them 24s
Got them bitches for the low
Now I'm riding with my hoe
Put my blinkers on and send her off in the Chinese store
I need me a pack of grape cigarillos
A Delaware Punch, fried rice and some egg rolls
You heard what I said, hoe
Gotta play it how it go
Young Money, Cash Money add up to a lot of dough
Crash test dummy when I'm racing in the Lambo
Push it to the limit like Ross when I stand for
Niggas wanna take me the walk like Rambo
So I gotta stay up on my toes like sandals
Passport, I'm everywhere you can't go
Lamping with another man's hoe

[Hook]

I'mma swing here, swing here, swing to the left
It's a '71 but it's got the engine of a new 'Vette
Better run when it's coming ten down in your set
Three cars last summer, I'm not finished yet
Smelling like a purple onion, spitting game talking money
Popping out of the dark, slide the valet a couple hundred
There's hoes looking, that's half of the reason that I've done it
I'll admit it, I fronted
I'll admit it, I stunted
But fuck it, what're you gonna to do me, sue me?
Answer is Curren$y, the question is who is he?
Looking at my feet, oh, these here? It's Gucci
And the logo for these is two G's
If I'm rolling with my crew, I've got a few G's
Niggas that'll tear your head off for a few G's
Oh jeez, I'm so connected with all the O.G.s
That's wild
