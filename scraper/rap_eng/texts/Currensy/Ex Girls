Another story to tell, another coin in the wishing well
Pulling tear, as the joining here, 36 grams on the digital scale
300 for the zipper, a little bit over an ounce, but that’s my nigga
Bring it over by these bitches, we get twisted like twizzlers
Flicking through these television channels, settle on Cartoon Network
Or the Animal Planet
Rubbing her ass, she want me to run through it
Like a stack of cash, blowing money fast
Make it back by noon, that’s why she moved on
But she never moved out of my reach
So she creep on the door to get by me
And living a dream, even if only a be temporarily
She steady behaving devilishly
Making any excuse to get loot, sirock a little lemonade
Maybe so grape juice
Throw it up sip some baby girl you can stay cool
Before him, I was her main dude but I knew
That I can never keep it true
I let her roam, she settle down with the right tangle
Old squares nigga, life with no wrist, he miss the danger
2 am champagne outside the airplane hangers
Cause a quarter millionaires, we top down and rain them
Her hair look good when it’s wet, it’s curling up I wanna fuck
We can get high and do it like we used to do it, before we broke up
Warrup?
I could still fuck all my ex girls
I’m sure that I could still fuck my all ex girls
I could still fuck all my ex girls
I’m quite sure that I could still fuck my all ex girls
And I took her from another nigga, knowing that shit could happen to me
But still I’m fucking with her fucking right
She whispered in my ear, she love a nigga truly, I love her back
Fuck if homies judge a nigga
Yeah, them long nights, she made it alright
A good meal, some good top, we had a day on cloud 9
I had to get through them jeans, she fine as wine
Through out them ups and downs, she held it down
I even spent my last dime on this dame
Her mama moved from the hood, I’m talking miles
So tough luck, she told me keep in touch
So we chill and fuck, smoke our last blunt
Done good for a few months and it faded
A couple months later she was dating
So to my little truelle, I wish you well
But tell homie, if I hit it then I own it, aw!
I could still fuck all my ex girls
I’m sure that I could still fuck my all ex girls
I could still fuck all my ex girls
I’m quite sure that I could still fuck my all ex girls x 2
