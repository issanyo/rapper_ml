[Verse 1: Young Roddy]

Life... Ugh

What you know about short days and them long nights boy, Tryin' to get your bread up
And my homie caught him a life sentence damn, hope he keep his head up
And I made it this far simply cuz why? I stayed prayed up
And I'm clearly past my limit
Tryin' to maintain my image
Gotta push start for my engine
I kick, push to go get it
For my dead passed I pour henny
To the single mother get money
Boy my rims touch and I'm hungry
All aware but ain't shit funny
I'm spaced out, I'm blunted
Will I make it out shit I wonder
All them crabs up in that bucket
Tryin' they best to pull the kid under
I don't think so
That fake shit'll make me go loco
I'm worldwide not just local
I'm too deep, me and my 44
Her ass fat, but I can handle that
Her head down when she throw it back

Life..

[Verse 2: Curren$y]

La La La La

The game funny so I don't play
Big money nigga heavyweight
Successful at every level so I graduate
With high honor marijuana Imma' levitate
Present that sideways slang Imma' set you straight
Should never have came in this lane if you couldn't accelerate
You been ran over flat line pancake
You do better steppin' off than ever standin' in my way
