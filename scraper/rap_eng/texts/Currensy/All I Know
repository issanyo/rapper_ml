[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Adidas slides, when I arrive
Hundreds socks, money knots
Left a couple killers outside, under strict instruction
If I ain't back in 15 minutes, They tryin somethin, Rush em
Chichi get the yayo
We could shape into what we want like Play-Doh, with this batch
A Ferrari FF hatchback
Brown cajun, blazin out the sour patch
Time lapsed, clouds passed, My mind wraps around plans to bring in more cash
Make em more mad, Jernt burnin slow
Biscayne Bay, Cigarrete Boats go fast
I know what they used to call em, because Im OG used to ballin
Now homie you can’t see, but you pretend that you was lookin for em
In a player ass loft witcho girlfriend cookin for em

[Chorus]
Money hoes clothes, yea that’s all a nigga know
Stars on the roof bitch, marble on the floor
A hunnit jernts comin yea that’s all a nigga know
Tell the truth you know I get it bitch, and all these niggas know

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Fifty roaches in the ashtray
Smokin better than good on a bad day
I could see my cars from this balcony
Bitch you could touch the stars from this balcony
Schoolin em
Teachers lounge, Drinkin crown with the faculty
To trade this, I had to be crazy bitch
Thought I made dumb decisions til they saw I made it stupid rich
Played it smart with my mind, not my heart
Automatic start, and assisted parallel park
And I don’t even like new cars, this for my broad
Grind hard with my dogs
Day oners, front runners, the done numbers
1997 Bulletproof Hummers
61 Impalas with the gold bumpers
Double antennas
Rap hustlin ass niggas smokin out yo bidness center for the whole winter

[Chorus]
Money hoes clothes, yea that’s all a nigga know
Stars on the roof bitch, marble on the floor
A hunnit jernts comin yea that’s all a nigga know
Tell the truth you know I get it bitch, and all these niggas know
