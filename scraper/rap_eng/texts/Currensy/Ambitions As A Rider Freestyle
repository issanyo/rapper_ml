[Verse: Curren$y]
Yeah
You know what it is man
Curren$y the Hot Spitta man
(?) man
Rich boys b the team man
Yeah
Yeah
I just got in the game
Niggas want to say that its over
Naw
I got my change up and bought me a Rove
You could get in my way and you can get rolled over
None of my niggas is rappers
Put 'em all on my shoulders
Yeah
And C Murder locked up on a bum charge
Told me "stay away from cops and the dumb broads
Save your money, get a crib
Nice backyard
And keep your heaters on you, never leave 'em in the car
Because you never know when niggas is watching
Niggas is plotting
Got a nice chain, niggas'll pop it"
I listened to pops and listened to mommy
Trust no one these niggas is grimy
Bitches remind me
Of Sharon Stone in the movie Casino
No matter what you do a ho still gon' be  aho
So if you know like how you roll you should let 'em know
And if she still out of control you should let her go
True (?) rich boys, niggas getting money
And I don't fuck with little dudes 'cause they living funny
Curren$y the Hot Spitta 2004
I been good and now the world gon' know holler
