[Verse 1]
One time for the Jets
Two times for ya muhfuckin' set
Hit it three times, make sure it's the best
Put some ice on her if it's always wet
Miami Vice Spyder or the Stingray Vette
I keep my shit fresh yea vintage like Mitchell and Ness
Stepping on the necks of muhfuckas who slept
Collecting checks, catching stunts in the progress
Take a late night drive to relieve stress
Bad bitch by my side who know how to [fire texts?]
Mute them boys who be talking that mess
Cop coupes, parked cars, that's a light flex
Lifestyle rap, that's my genre I guess
Founder, forefather, sports car auction baller
Low rider Impalas, executive quarters
Writing rhymes and making muthafuckin' orders
Jars of weed indeed yea we recordin'
Instrumentals spent lyrical in the morning
Been reading up, grasping on legal jargon
Tighten up
They gon' use the whole checkbook tryna write for us
Lighting up smoke signals
Spell it out, Andretti all about figures
Look in my eyes when I entered the building
Tell y'all that I was gon' leave with a million

[Chorus]
And they I'm still spittin'
And they I'm still spittin'
And they I'm still spittin'
And they I'm still

[Bridge]
Can it be he stayed away too long
Is Kanye still riding 'round with Trump
Hope if he hear this he don't get mad
Just give us some vintage sample tracks

[Verse 2]
Elise bucket, sweater to match
Stan Smiths from UK with the velcro strap
Welcome to the layer cake, take a loss, bounce back
Game costs, you gon' have to pay the boss
Press a button in my car, my roof came off
You gon' cry in the bus stop or this Ferrari darling
Life hard, leather soft
In my house watching a [?] doc about the Chedda Boyz
All respect, my Detroit fam we connect
Burn it down, every time I'm around
Muscle cars burn rubber, stripes on the ground
Back to my hometown, Andretti pounds
Inspiration, just waiting
To be rolled in the paper, push me to sadist
Rest in peace to the homie Young Greatness
Every day in the city is another risk that we taking
Dangerous games but we keep playing
'Cause we know deep inside one of us gon' make it
Rolling dice every night when you choose to ride nice
And hop out the car rocking ice
Treat yourself and you'll become a target
Gotta be cautious when you balling
That's not just for New Orleans, homeboy that's e'rywhere
They ain't playing fair out there

[Chorus]
And they I'm still spittin'
And they I'm still spittin'
And they I'm still spittin'
That's what they say
