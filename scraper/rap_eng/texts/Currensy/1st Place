[Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]
I stay on top of my game I’m sayin no time for playin
Paper on my mind
Doing business with whoever paying the most
Fast or slow, I gotta get this dough
Touched a few pieces off features but I still want more
What the fuck you think I’m grinding for
Tryin to upgrade my automo-
Stacking bills, smoking kill, chilled out with my foreign ho
First night with the villain resort life, we just burning O's
Smashed at got my mind back to where the cash at, You know how it go
I’m out the door my mind focus on dough, I’m so fixed on these digits
But she swear a nigga out here fuckin around with this other bitches
And I ain't got no time for that, tryin to get to this money love
Homie trust, I’m only gettin my paper up
Counting Franklins, Jacksons, Grants
You can tell from all these paper cuts, on my hand
I been on the straight plan to make millions out of grands so
All I ask is you keep it real it's Super Ville in Jet Life we trust
Stay away from them lames, they look the same but them niggas ain't us

[Hook: Curren$y] x2
Put my hustle down got my money up
All them bitches come around cause my niggas coming up now
We put our hustle down got our money up
All them bitches run to us cause they don’t want no runners up, clown

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Nigga I go Deebo hard or I'll carry my ass home
But I’ll be damn if it's back to living up in that drug zone
Shit and I know that’s right but how they getting but I don't call that wrong
In the midst of it all nigga we stay G while we drop bombs
Wait but hold on let me find something roll up on
They say it’s now or never just hoping now it don’t take too long
I’m on my paper chasing we chasin bread and it’s marathon
Yeah I love pussy but plenty of nights I done slept alone
I done it on my own just me myself and my microphone
And til my next life I yell Jet life til I’m dead and gone
Stay high up when the loud pack its that Cali strong
Ain't no child play no need for that girl both us grown
Frontin ain't paying nobody bills better keeps your hustle going
Over these camp fire I tell my ghetto story
I put my life in this bars but they still don’t know me
In this fast lane I move slowly I’m focused nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Mann..
I been gettin it been gettin it that bad man that bad man
The hoes be on me like tube socks, Range Rover no roof top
Took two shots of that brown brown we downtown
We kicking the like it’s my birthday
JET Set, real niggas, 1st Place
You never winnin if you’re jealous of
Another nigga don’t be jealous of how well he does
Just focus on your own team and they can help you up
I’m young and rich a bunch of bitches blow the celly up
And I can’t even blame em
Send me naked pictures I'mma frame em on the iPhone
I’m rolling up a Instagram: that's a gram in one blunt
Twenty for the point 5
Its like a brown bag lunch higher than the top bunk
I'd still pop Rihanna I cannot front
Barbequing putting vodka in the fruit punch
So you better watch her or she mine man
Ain't no ring on her finger like LeBron hand

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Curren$y]
Rolling up piles of them sky miles
Coolin in the honey cut
Listening to some Miles Davis – yeah I’m rich
But I’m still using my Playstation for a DVD player
Never gave up motherfuck
Not in the business of saving sluts
Theres a auction on some retail space
So I’m saving up and they sayin I’m a made man but I ain’t made enough
No baker though i’m cakin up
Take the game and told my niggas take their cut

[Hook]
