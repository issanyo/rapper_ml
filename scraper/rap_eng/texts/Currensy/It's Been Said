Uh
Jets
Yup
Mother fucker you know
Uh
Jets nigga
(?)
Uh, uh
Flow like Clark wallabees
Created and cultivated under palmtrees
Sun foor open, AC on
Smoking and cooling, misusing the freon
NYCA jeans on
Stitching's the same color I lean my whip on
Bitches know one thing
Bring my green home
Weed and paper
Joint roller and the NES controller on the coffee table
Playing original kung fu loaded
Homie only had four moves
I bet you never noticed
And they label me a stoner
A bit of a pot head it has been said
I keep one rolled up like LL's pants legs
Niggas ain't fucking with the planes
Jordan quatros do not lace the eyelets up on my wings
Hot Spitta man yeah
