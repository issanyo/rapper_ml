[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah
Uh
280ZX, Mercedes and 'Vettes
Celebrity guests write heavy checks
Can't disclose it all
But know I'm about to ball
The fuck out on yall
Money talk and diamonds speaking
Got your hoes tweaking
They big upping the boss
Like she needed a reason
To get lost in the evening
And take it all
She done it cause she want it
She was so womanly I called her mama
Though she younger than me
She was only 20 when she come to me
I laced her with a little game
She gave me a lot of money
Though I never asked for a thing
Higher than Saturn's rings
Living in the clouds before I stepped aboard the plane
Gourmet cheddar trays and champagne
Rolex presidential campaign
Critics hating that's a goddamn shame
They done Jim Morrison the same thing
Rivals in the storm smoking in the rain man

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah
La da da da da
Fell out with some niggas as I got richer
Lost my main bitch as I got richer
She ain't dead I just ain't fucking with her
