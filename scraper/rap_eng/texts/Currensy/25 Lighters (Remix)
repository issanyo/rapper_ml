[Intro: wifisfuneral]
Ayy
Got it on smash
Ayy, ayy, yuh

[Chorus: wifisfuneral]
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Ayy)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (Ayy)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Okay)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (What?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Huh?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet?

[Verse 1: wifisfuneral]
Okay, like, smokin' on this kill, I'm so fucked up, my life's a interlude
Pretty sure I held my pride, if I can't die, like, what got into you?
People pushin' on my whip now, hip now
I just spent a quarter on my wrist, like, what that shit 'bout?
This is real life, no cap, I'm on the tac, like, "Check my fist now"
Hol' up, like, keep your breath, I stay off edge, like, who my shit now?
Listen, okay, all my life been deaded, deadman bless me 'till I'm restless
Bring it back, write my thoughts to mention, burn my past until it's present
You can't kill my soul, forget it, you too evil for my section
Wait, like, tell me why I'm better then? Bitch better check my letterman
Hand free smoke like cigarettes
They new shit now my biggest threat
Like, bitch, I'm in my element
Bring it back, brick back, hold that, uh
We can only minus with the toe tag
All up in the middle, run four flat, uh
All up in the middle, run four flat, uh
Bring it back, brick back, hold that, uh
We can only minus with the toe tag
All up in the middle, run four flat, uh
All up in the middle, run four flat, uh

[Chorus: wifisfuneral]
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Ayy)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (Ayy)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Okay)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (What?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Huh?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet?

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh, I got 25 lighters on my dresser
30 cars in my collection quite impressive
I pull up on bitches, they be under pressure
My last one wasn't right, so I left her
Baby, you should take that loss as a lesson
All we mash is Corvettes and better
Porsche Carrera, no top in the weather
It's so perfect how me and paper go together
I stack it up and use some to wrap the leather
I got my own strain, I'm a boss in the game
Musical cocaine, 'cause I'm a dope mane
Rims pokin', I'm swervin', hoggin' up both lanes
I'm from New Orleans, I stay everywhere, I'm hoppin' planes
Rolex and Cuban chains, diamonds in my pinky ring
Money is not a thing, but I'm so glad I got it, mane
Money is not a thing, but I'm so glad I got it, mane

[Chorus: wifisfuneral]
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Ayy)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (Ayy)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Okay)
Okay, like, 25 lighters on my dresser (Okay)
I woke up still dead, forgot to mention (What?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Huh?)
I'm sick off the drugs, like, what's my best bet? (Huh?)
