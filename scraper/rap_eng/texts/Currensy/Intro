This my favorite part though
Ohh shit, haha cause we know we finished

Yep, another month, another take
I could waste my time with bullshit instructions like, roll somethin' up or pour somethin' up
But if yall fucking with me you should already have it rolled up or poured up
Month six, Fast Times at Ridgemont Fly
Let my boy just talk for a minute
(Float on, Float on)
The Floaters if you don't know
Don't download it, buy it for real
Support real music
I give y'all enough free music
So y'all shouldn't have to pirate quality music
Cause I give y'all free quality music every month
This is month six... Fast Times at Ridgemont Fly

Trademark the Skydiver is at Subway diggin' the sandwitches
And Mr. Marcelo is sleeping on the floor
Dickies engineering the sessions, as he always does
Got his gray doorag on, it's hangin' in the back
I don't really agree with that, but it's alright I'm not really trippin'
Haha, and he's still upset that the Lakers lost
And even Brett Favre is fucking with the Jets
So we don't have too much to complain about
And I just dropped a roach in the Burger King cup I hope my brother won't drink from it
If so, you're skrewed
Fast Times at Ridgemont Fly...
