More cash for the safe
More dope for the scale
We do this everyday, got that game for sale
Always another way for us to get the mail
We do this everyday, got that game for sale
We do this everyday, got that game for sale
More cash for the safe
More dope for the scale

[Verse]
My ways grew in the naps I let my mill stack
Spice 1 taught me that, I learned that from his raps
Bitches be like 'round what time you think you coming back'
Let me stack another mill, we can fuck and take a power nap
After that I'm scratching back to where the cash is
I gots to have it, collecting Chevrolet classics is a habit
But long as I keep counting cabbage if I want I can grab it
Save it, stash it, bring it all one night and stop the traffic
Medusa coupe, haters turning stone stuck looking at it
Legend Of Harvard Blue

We do this everyday, got that game for sale
