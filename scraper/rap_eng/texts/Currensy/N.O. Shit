[Curren$y]
It's not what you know, it's what you can prove
And I can so prove, that I'm better than you
Sweater, neck crew
Fuck your dress code, let the Jets through
Smelling like, medical
See it my way, life from a better view, loser
Living life, not making moves - vegetable
Might as well be dead
Redline in the old school
Classy, call that museum riding
Yeah, fuck you thought
I fell off?, Nah, I fell back
Countach, put the doors up
Call the weed man and a couple hoes up
Shooting pool...
Thinking 'bout when pops used to bring me to the barber shop
That was cool...
Bumping smokey, '84 Grand National rolling
All I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit
Jacked The Caribbean Queen from Billy Ocean
Bring her back before the nigga even notice
Smooth sails...
Spitta prevail and these counterfeit niggas fail, yea
Smooth sails...
Spitta prevail and these counterfeit niggas fail, yea

All I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit
All I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit
All I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit
All I know is sleepin' with one eye open, That N.O shit
