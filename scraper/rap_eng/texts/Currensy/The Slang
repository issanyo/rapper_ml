[Intro]
All I've ever done was my thang
All they ever did was steal game
Not paying homage, trying to sound the same
Trying to borrow slang's, knowing that they ain't gang

[Hook]
All I've ever done was my thang
All they ever did was steal game
Not paying homage, trying to sound the same
Trying to borrow slang's, knowing that they ain't gang

[Verse 1]
Million dollar airplane, took 20 bands to fill it up
My nigga roll one, picture us
In the French Riviera, bossin', twistin' killa up
It ain't nothing to blown a million dollars in a month

[Hook]
All I've ever done was my thang
All they ever did was steal game
Not paying homage, trying to sound the same
Trying to borrow slang's, knowing that they ain't gang

[Verse 2]
Pulled up with my Loc's on
Blowin' that smoke out, bitches want to go home and work out
Tryin' to see if it's as good as she had heard about
I smashed her home girl, she still running her mouth
Promoting, putting that word out
I'm in that soft top Impala going hard for them dollars
If you were smart, you would follow
Cause this is guidance

[Hook]
All I've ever done was my thang
All they ever did was steal game
Not paying homage, trying to sound the same
Trying to borrow slang's, knowing that they ain't gang
All I've ever done was my thang
All they ever did was steal game
Not paying homage, trying to sound the same
Trying to borrow slang's, knowing that they ain't gang

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Dadada dada dada dada dada dada
