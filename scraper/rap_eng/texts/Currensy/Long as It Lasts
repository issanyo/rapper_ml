[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, long as it lasts, I'm in this coupe dash
Pursuin' cash, foot on the gas
Pedal to the floor, another score, another bag
Pull up on my bitch, after I pull up, what I grab
Yeah yeah, livin' like that
Tell the homies meet me at the pad
Got somethin' for you, a little bit that I had stashed
Never run out on we have
Pour the drank like the gas, yeah
Long as it lasts
In this coupe in pursuit of the cash, yeah
Pedal to the floor, uh, another score, another bag

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Drove four cars to the event, I know it didn't make sense
But I had to make a statement, show 'em that I'm not the one to play with
Underground sounds from the pavement
Made it, major paper without tap dancing for them majors
But we sat down at the same table
I never changed angles
They gotta take it how I gave it
Without radio station rotation in our home location
I'm still skatin', ridin' race, had low riders on Dayton
Return of the real, they been anticipating
But we been here the whole time
Baby in the cut waitin', wrappin' up these bales, duct tapin'
The trap advisor brung a fishscale so we can weigh it
OG style, 1991, Nike sweatsuits and submachine guns
Answer no questions when them motherfuckers come
Long as it lasts
I'm in this coupe in pursuit of the cash
Pedal to the floor, another score, another bag
Pull up on my bitch, after I pull up, what I grab, yeah
Told the homies meet me at the pad
Put somethin' aside, a little bit that I had stashed
Never run out of this shit that we have
Tell the shooters they can put down the MAC's
But them youngins still stay ready to blast, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Yeah, this feel like King James when he went back to Cleveland
I used to pass the rock like I'm Steve Nash
I'm killin' this game without no ski mask
Board the jet, I brought my passport and my G pass
My nerves bad, I told my bro to hit the weed man
This ain't no game, this ain't no freeze tag, and ain't shit for free man
We all want to dream
Smokin' on that heat man, was taught to keep it G man
I stack G's, I'm a young OG
Born in the city where them boys play for keeps
Rollie shinin', we started off at the bottom
Like O-Dawg, I take your life for the squadron
Ridin' 'til the tires flat, runnin' rook like a running back
Same hoes who curved a nigga, now they want some holler back
Never that, white girl, I pedal that
Free Tig, he done been through hell and back
Blow it all and make it back, pussy good, I double back
JetLyfe 'til my next nigga, life
