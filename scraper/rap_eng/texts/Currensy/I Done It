[Hook]
I told y’all niggas when I get my loot
I was going to get a couple Chevrolet old schools
And I done it
I said I was gon’ do it, I does it, nigga, I don’t be stunting
I told y’all niggas when I get my cash
I was going to get a truck and a hard top Jag
And I done it
I said I was gon’ do it, I does it, nigga, I don’t be stunting

[Verse 1]
’71 Chevelle SS with the big rims
And no tint, nigga, you know who it is
Hot spitter, that’s him
DC logo on my fitted brim
Eyelids barely open when these women are approaching him
Rosay bottle in my left hand, money in my right
Feeling like this the best night of my life
Wait limit, think twice, because last night was a motherfucker
And if the lord stay the same then tomorrow probably gon’ be a beast too
I’m posted up at the crib watching T2
The sequel to The Terminator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
Eating grits and turkey bacon
Got a house full of bitches and they all naked
Young Money, dummy, that’s long paper
Fly Society, passports and bad broads
House with a backyard full of fast cars

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I blew up on ‘em, and they ain't like that
They say I’m changing on ‘em, and it ain't like that
I’m a real nigga, that’s on my life, [?]
Hit me on my MySpace about some money, I’ll write back
Shit, I’m just trying to get me some digits
In the low low hitting switches
Bumping “Fuck them Other Niggas” by my nigga Corey Miller
You know him as C-Murder, tried to sink my nigga’s ship
But they overturned the verdict
Party in Miami with my Young Money family
In a yellow Maserati that I got flew in from Cali
Catty ass girlfriends always looking at me
Half of ‘em be wanting to kiss me
Other half be wanting to smack me

[Hook]
