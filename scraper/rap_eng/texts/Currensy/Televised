The reeferlution will be televised..

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
From High Times Cannabis Cup judging the red
Carpet parties in New Orleans for my homecoming
Bring your own buds in for test inspection
'Fore access is granted to my section
My diesel East Coast, my kush is Western Conference
Chronic, nothing but bombest
For the elitest of rhymers and beat designers
You smell these trees leaking through your equalizers
A boss on them raws though I started with them EZ Widers
OG daytons nigga not them eagle wires
A couple niggas from the old block mad
So when I visit I park my lo-lo in the grass - to keep an eye out
Smoking one for the homie on the mural as I ride past
If I was drinking, I'd have poured some wine out
Knockin' Frank, Amy Winehouse
Candy paint on my skybox, tell a square bitch "watch out!"

[Hook - Curren$y]
The reeferlution will be televised..
We getting money now
The reeferlution will be televised..

[Verse 2 - Fiend]
The new-school coupe just left the paint booth
Got me stepping like a Nupe, barking like a Que
G'd up music, we spark a barbeque
Got a '70 Carlo named after daughter too
X-Men Wolverine blue, you can see the water too
Oak wood turning, know what we burning
Absolutely, baby! International Jones, jet life
Iron Gang and the air is our home
[Paper plates in our sportsman's paradise?]
You were smoking with ? what do I sacrifice
Paint job fine as the hair on a frog's back
The green you bringing better glow or stank or we don't want that
Get My leaders from Houston
Monsta Beatz on the heat that we using
My engine sounds like it's been juicin'
Chick bad my stick, I'm shooting
Spitta Andretti, what we call it? Reefer

The reeferlution will be televised..
Yeah mama, we getting money now
