[Intro]
You could turn it up
This one got wax on it
Cement 4s, cocaine flows

[Verse 1]
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
Stunt on these hoes, show 'em what I drove
Bitch I rock heavy gold because I set goals
And then I go and get it like a hustler supposed
Full bloomin' flower, from the concrete rose up
Now I pull up on the streets and they be like "whoa"
Zuckerburg Spitta, I'm in the meeting in a Rolls
But I'm not even there, FaceTime from my home
'Cuz I'm waitin' for FedEx to deliver a package
More parts for the Chevrolet, I low-ride everyday
Break it, then I fix it
Get back in it and keep dippin'
Only the gangsterous bitches get visits when I'm on Daytons and switches

[Hook]
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
Stunt on these hoes, show 'em what I drove

[Verse 2]
My Rolex cold, my bezel froze
The face and the band, iced out, North Pole
Need this ice on my wrist because it's sprained and swole
Too much time over the stove, whippin' audio dope
The demand too high for the shop to ever close
That's why we stay open long as they payin' for it
You know I stay focused, go wherever the dough is
[Inaudible] Porsches fit like pistols in holsters
Drinks to coasters, we some high-class stoners
Leavin' thousand dollars worth of roaches (lifestyle that they dyin' for)
Live the lifestyle that they dyin' for
Bitch all my cones got waxes on 'em

[Hook]
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
Stunt on these hoes, show 'em what I drove

[Outro]
I got lights on my roof, bitch I got me a Rolls
I said "Sorry for the Wraith", it only got two doors
Cement 4s, cocaine flows
