[Verse 1: Curren$y]
And I never came down from the last time, but that don't mean nothing, nigga still climbin'
Bitches popping bottles and they sipping pink diamonds
I took a break from the game and I seen these niggas clownin'
The blogs wouldn't be the same if you took Spitta out it
Props to the ones who instrumentally getting me poppin'
Ballin' without first learning the fundamentals, forget about it
Tryna 360 up the middle - you ain't even learn to dribble
Twiddling my thumbs, smoking lime
Watching hamster ass rappers run in wheels, going nowhere with they rhymes
Stuck, Glenn Robinson, big dog bucks, socks up, top down
Killing squares, riding 'round
Coolest nigga in yo city, even when I'm not in town
Smoking like I signed for 50 million and I'm underground, yeah
Uh, smoking like I signed for 50 million, still underground
