[Hook: Curren$y]
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Hop out my car, with a house on my hand
Rolex dripping Fiji, when I wipe off my pants
Last night when you seen me we was after them bands
This morning when you seen us we was trappin again
Parked the orange Diablo in the back of the lab
Drop bangers with Fiend and then we slangin with Slab
Wings extended with it, what you want you can have
Watch me whip them all singing outta this notepad
Drop musical cocaine, what you want you can have
Want that regular shit, you in the wrong place for that
Pockets on fat, they never going flat
I was broke before and I'm never going back
They could never know the stone cold facts
His whole family rat, she probably gon' crack
Pulled up in a Benz, pulled off in a 'Lac
My hands startin to itch, I need to count scratch

[Hook: Curren$y]
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man

When the spaceship pass, they say there go the man
When the drop top fast, they say there go the man
When the Rolex flash they say there go the man
Pop a bottle, pour a glass, raise a toast to the man
Yeah

Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
If we ain't talkin' money, lets not say a word
I'm rap hustlin' right now, right price I still will serve ya
Audio and non-studio whats the verdict
Hidden corners no tint, now that's a clean murder
I used to daydream of ballin' , hustling got up on it
Out Miami I be shinin' , it was Trish and Tony
Red Ferrari California, got my eyes on it
Fell asleep countin' money, I finished in the morning
I roll a big ol' stick of dope and dry my nuts on niggas
Spitta gased hopped his foreign, front the law, ain't trippin'
Nike tech, white gold (?)
Got big ol' stones in my mouth, I don't do diamond dust
Just WAAH

[Hook: Curren$y]
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man

When the spaceship pass, they say there go the man
When the drop top fast, they say there go the man
When the Rolex flash they say there go the man
Pop a bottle, pour a glass, raise a toast to the man
Yeah

Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
Now when they see me they say there go the man
There go the man
There go the man
