[Intro: Flight Attendant Talks]
(Okay, as we get ready to take off, please make sure to check that your seat belts are fastened, that your tray tables are up, and that your electronics are off.)
Checks nigga, why haven't we been there? Fuckboys wondering if they bitch next
(As the crew comes through to make final cabin checks, please let us know if you have any questions or need any help. We promise to do everythig we can to make sure you have a saft, comfortable flight.)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, With these lazy eyes I seen
More than you can see in seven lifetimes
Get you on track got the fresh scoop from inside
Give you insight on the situation cause I done it twice
Done a dotted line tightrope walk
Where the suits want results they don't talk
Dozens of songs locked away and rotten in a vault
No one to blame it was solely my fault
No salt thrown, just boss game long
Right now I'm not trippin pimpin you can pay me for it when you get it
I'm tryna get a bigger home, put my niggas on
They puttin they niggas on we getting really strong
Met Rex jets, best shape ever
Winner circle, you squares need to get it together
Or stop hanging with each other go somewhere and get it separate
Your bitch want that vitamin D she looking desperate
Bullshit convo five minutes invested
Now she buck-naked lying to you via text message
In a snap like celery or fresh lettuce
Get beheaded trying to get ahead of us
You know what way is up

[Verse 2 : Young Roddy]
Yeah
As the world still turning
My joint still burning
I hold my head high and I got that from uncle Vernon
So, if you want respect, you gotta earn it
It's crazy, most people never learn it
Preach!
So, before they hear my sermon
Here's my confession, I get dressed with my burner
Sheesh!
I know that ain't right
But I know when shit's weak
Try livin' on my tray first streets
So, before I fall asleep
With a certified freak
Who just tryna get her hands on some courtside seats
I'm cool
Nice try, but you can't get that from me
Nice guy, hard body man it way too weak
Gucci broads even said I keep it way too G
I never try to be something I'm not
I do me
I find it better on my own two feet
Roddy keep it unique and low key
Jets Fool

[Verse 3 : Trademark da Skydiver]
Fresh Polo bucket
All them niggas know I'm acting' out
Smoke so much kush in the whip I started blacking out
I'm hoppin out in one of the freshest without a doubt
Bitches love when I come around, they know what I'm about
Take em to the house
Fuck em good, smoke em out
Burn a whole ounce with a mama back to my paper route
I'm tryna put a couple a dollars in my money pouch
Bag to bag transactions then I'm over and out
Dumb it down?
Never that, you should know me buy now
I'm floating on a kush cloud and I never come down
Jet set, international we world renowned
All for takin niggas bitches when we come in town
Lames cryin over hoes, thats tears of a clown
I'm smokin on some purple and green, you steaming brown
Leaves with them sticks and seeds, they should see me now
Its M-O-B, I rest in peace on a money pile
