[Intro]
You got a bad bitch
You better hide her
If she grin
The. I got her
Yea

[Verse 1]
Fasheazy my neazy get these girls so easy
Can't leave Spitta alone
These chicks need me
Know I sound best over beats that's breezy
Know I got a swag that belongs on the TV
And the Champagne and THC
Got your bitch in my crib turned on like my ADT alarm when I'm gone I am known
For runnin up in other nigga's bitches
If you look through my phone you'll find a couple of familiar naked pictures
I promise ain't a oil spill slicker
You waitin on your girl to come home
You might as well have a snicker
She kickin it with me and you at home on the couch with the kids
Playin Nintendo Wii
And in less then a week
She can't get me on a phone
Cause I done changed numbers like
Kobe on the forum
On to the next broad fine as a horse and fly
I guess you could call her a unicorn
Not a hootie you belong
Why ain't you on his arm?
I told her I been plotting on her all night long
She grin, I'm in, I'm gone, again, yea

[Hook]
Spitta in the club is a problem
If you got a bad bitch you better hide her
You know the rules if she grin than I got her
Navigation Pimpin baby girl let me guide ya, yeah
[x2]

[Verse 2]
And I didn't come around actin all friendly
To steal the spotlight like Mr Bentley
All I did was valet that Bentley
Caught eyes for a minute
Sex signs she sent me
Quite simply put
She was took
By the nigga with the fly flowin weed song hooks
Looks like this might be a job for the jets where haven't we been yet
Fuckboys wonderin if they bitch next
Hoe Spitta talkin tell me all your business
I digress but I have to mention
She fakes it when y'all make it
Cause she don't wanna hurt your little feelings
Look to the ceiling the planes in the building
Hoes slipping out of handcuffs like magicians
Real bitches dig it cause I kill it consistent
Think your girl won't be on my tapes but she be listenin
Nike Uptempo Scottie Pippen edition
'64 Continental suicidal door hinges
On the way to meet a couple of my niggas
With a pocket full of Kush
And a car full of your bitches yea

[Hook x2]
