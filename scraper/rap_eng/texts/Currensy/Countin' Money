Countin' money while my bitches sleep
Countin' money 'til my niggas eat
Countin' money while my bitches sleep
Countin' money 'til my niggas eat

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I was high, she was high
Nowadays we don't even drive
New Supreme don't wait in the line
She give me brain, that's a piece of mind
Smoking wax, OG kush combined, money that's my time
You know the saying, don't be wasting mine
Fresh out of papers, lil momma complaining
Saying it's too much smoke
Telling us we too down to Earth to be famous
Well who told you getting money would change us?
The same niggas probably told you
That the gang would fail
But they wrong cause my pack better than ever
I'm jet setting whenever I want
And

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Master craftsman, paper stacking
The scent of jasmine on the bed, she's baby napping
She's been working hard, let her sleep
I made it rain on her all night, she only get wet for G's
Yeah I be, example of, manning up, standing up
Not setting for that ho shit, smashing 'em
What's happening bruh? Same shit but the toilet bowl gold
Royal flush in my royal blue Rolls rolling up
Something out of old, or the double S riding slow
Mind open but my eyes low
Focused on the only goal
If I want it, I'ma donk it
You know

[Hook]
