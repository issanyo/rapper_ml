[Chorus](x4)
Gotta get that paper though
Gotta get that paper though

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Showed up to collect
Showed up out of respect
Showed up for the check
Put it down and I left with a whole lot
Nigga if you didn't know about it then you know now
Jet Life homie too high for you to hold down
Talk about the money 'cause I get a whole lot
My nigga name buzzin' so I give him more now
I was a youngin playing Jay-Z instrumentals so loud
In my room tryna pen my lyrics with my door locked
OG in the game [?]
Own strain of weed own clothing line
Give me mine

[Chorus](x4)
Gotta get that paper though
Gotta get that paper though

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
I kick a door down let me in this bitch my nigga
Only feel that I need is to get rich my nigga
Heard you went to jail now you startin' to snitch my nigga
I get that paper then I split it with my niggas
I flooded my pocket with big faces
Lemon head diamonds looking like you could taste it
Its just the dash in my ride add the flavor
Never put my self around a nigga who be hating
Lacing, dope on the track every time
I came through they knew I was gon' put it down
Like my weed, I'm the bomb
Model bitches on my line
I'm ahead of my time
Man on the come up, T.Y

[Chorus](x4)
Gotta get that paper though
Gotta get that paper though
