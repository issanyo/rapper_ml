[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Ya...ya shawty came up
The goal is to become untouchable
Too high for land lovers to fuck with you
Keep a couple killers in the cut with you
Bad bitches rollin' up with you
Pour up a cup or two, whatever you do
Gotta enough for the whole crew, so bring em all through
Money is nothin' it's more of becomin continuous hustlin'
Baby girl tryna stuff it in the duffles and strugglin' its' funny
Rich folk issues, reach you niggas tissues
Cryin cause we shinin', homie you wishin' it was you
Instead of puttin it all into comin up, you rather be mad with us
Huh you bitch you

[Chorus]
Shawty came up, OG smokin OG by the OZ rollin' up straight trophy
First place winner golden cup, championship for players like us
Shawty came up, OG smokin OG by the OZ nigga that's us

[Verse 2]
Hater raise up out my way bruh
Spitta on the chase for that paper
I'm bumping the Jacka Mac Dre and the scraper
Smoke screen in the face of any hater
We eating over here leave a 100 for the waiter
We eating over here no cell phones at the table
We eating over here gaining weight we still in good shape uh

[Chorus]
Shawty came up, OG smokin OG by the OZ nigga that's us
Shawty came up, OG smokin OG by the OZ rollin' up straight trophy
First place winner golden cup, championship for players like us
