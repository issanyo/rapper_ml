Niggas on that bish shit
I'm tryna get rich quick
Money is my lingo, if you ain't talkin I ain't listenin
Niggas like snitches, all up in ya bidness
Goin around sayin shit that you ain't even mentioned
I'm far from a Pac see I'm a boss pay attention
Let me, dip my pen and pencil I could paint you this picture
Lyrics come inscripted just like Da Vinci codes scriptures
Spit acid on a track, you could test it with a Litmus
If you ain't on my level I won't expect you to get this
Like an 80 yard punt, I kick shit
Only time I left was when I came walkin in with the biscuit
I'm harder than concrete, they softer than bisquick
I'm the Supervillain not to be confused or mixed with
These other wack niggas that is coming off my district
Yeah you know the deal

Don't get it twisted like them sixty kickflips, yeah

[Verse 2 - Curren$y]
Uhh
Mr. Clark East side high
That was a old school
So is my Ride
Niggas be tryin to see the Jets they go blind
I'm on set gettin high, video vixens missing my trailer pack
You tryna peek in from the outside
I'm fry crispy so crispy word to kid Shine
Maybe not when you want it, but I got that on time
Message to them impatient bitches who ain't respect my grind
Twist one up for them haters
I'm just countin my paper
Talking calculators and digits with my Skydiver nigga
No second guessing the question in a second is sure
Ridin, Street Wiz in the kitchen
You know what that means, Moet sto'd for ass hoes no doubt
I'll build a Jet wave through yo house, move out
