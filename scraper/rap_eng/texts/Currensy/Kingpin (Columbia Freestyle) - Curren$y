Verse 1:
Yo, I can make cocaine
Bitches gettin high from my music
I just left the studio
I swear I treat that bitch just like a crack house
I put that work in pull them stacks out
Now Im ridin' round in that Ferrari
Fifty racks in the jaridge back pack
I turn any situation into a party
But wait, I be makin' cocaine
Dealin' money from this motherfuckin rap thing
Yo, I get back to the studio
I tell my bitch bring an ounce and a pack of cones
Hol' on, I be writin' cocaine
Raps every dope bitch wanna dope man
Yo,I just left the studio
Bitch want a g nigga I come ride through
She put it on her life she in love with me
Baby girl just in love what that dick do
Her home girl said I was official
So now she comin' for herself to see if its true
Wait, I be writin cocaine
Raps at the crib chillen watchin' Scarface (yeah)
Got a bitch rollin' up
Now Im smokin' while that ho makin' pizza rolls
OG kush put you in a sleeper hold
If you a rookie then my doobies you don't need to smoke

Around here it ain't said you already know

Audio dope man
Originat-tor
Of this audio dope game mayne
