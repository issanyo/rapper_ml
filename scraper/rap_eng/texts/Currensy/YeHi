[Intro]
Like yay high
Tryna stack this paper like yay high
Yeah
Put these blocks together like

[Verse 1]
Put these blocks together like Lego's
You could get laid down if we say so
Weigh the value of your life up against a peso
Bundle up boy this world stay cold
Give a fuck you'll get crushed before the day closed
Crash course on how the game go
Living by the same code, guidelines
Wise guys abide by back in '84
Open up the market, started slamming them Mercedes doors
Shit I been through made me dope
This shit I been through made me cold
Shit I been through, you pussy, that shit woulda made you fold
Lost my first homie when I was 12 years old
Taught me to trust not a soul
Closest ones to ya will do ya, get up under ya
Try to take things from ya, steal your thunder
But I strike like lightning
Any battle that I fight it's always the right one
Swinging my sword for the ones coming up that's really writing
Not that garbage robot recitings, that's trifling

[Chorus]
Send it off to the wayside, tryna stack that paper up yay high
Tryna stack that paper up yay high
Tryna stack that paper up yay high

[Verse 2]
I'm tryna stack that paper up yay high
Fly private planes through the night sky
Niggas ain't on this type of grind
That's why they stones ain't as bright as mine
Parked in front my home, stoned in my Rolls composing rhymes
Never is there downtime, I'm all about a profit on an incline
Money all on my mind, make all the money mine
Every dollar every dime 'til I flatline
Expansion, mansion, fashion, lady devils having a moonlight dances
Roll the dice with your life, go on, chance it
Big wrist win championships

[Outro]
All day I'm
Tryna stack that paper up yay high
Tryna stack that paper up yay high
Yeah
Yeah
Tryna stack that paper up yay high
Niggas ain't on this kinda grind
They vision ain't sharp as mine
Tryna stack that paper up yay high
