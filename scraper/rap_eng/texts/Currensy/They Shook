[Hook]
For the hundred doller billers
Yea
My name is in the streets
My name is in the streets
My name is my name

[Verse 1]
It's a war goin on outside
So I got bulletproof glass on the cars I drive
Roll by and I catch broads eyes
But I ignore 'em and I keep on goin
Got the Mobb Deep bangin and my a/c blowin
Niggas on their last legs and their wounds is open
So I'm on 'em like sharks smellin' blood in the ocean
Hot Spitta I'm a seasoned vet
What's fucked up is I haven't dropped an album yet
But I don't cry over spilled milk, clean up the mess
Get a glass and refill my shit
Nigga mad cause his girlfriend feel my shit
He get in the car
And talk loud all through the song
Make sure she can't hear my shit
My California homies told me that I spit
Vision that I belong on the top 10 list
These original Jordans, these ain't retros slick
You lil niggas betta learn your kicks
Can't tell when she lyin, better learn your bitch
Said she was with her girl, but she at my crib
Well the truth she ain't lyin to you, she is with her girl
But her girl over here too, and we ain't doin nothin but fuckin'
And tryna come up with a recipe for weed rice crispie treats
I'm the rapper your favorite rapper be happy to meet
Swagga never can be unraveled, I'm tight as can be
Ask God to keep haters away from me
Tryna live all my days sucka free
Got the next generation lookin' up to me
My influence ain't that hard to see
I'm bringin New Orleans back
Matter fact the mayor need to inaugurate me
