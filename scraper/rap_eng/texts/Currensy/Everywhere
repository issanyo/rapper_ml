[Intro]
Yeah, smokin', eh, eh
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
(Sucka ass nigga thinking its all 'bout you.... You a fool)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
She only lovin' on the dollars
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Pull up in the '62 Impala, smelling like that California fire
My girl, my smoke, both exotic, my flow is straight dope narcotics
I'm watching Narcos in the Audi, not my shit but a bad bitch driving
Eight seven on the I-10, used to be a mule flying in products in from the islands
Buy a nigga anything, he want two 15's in the trunk homeboy, I'm stylin'
Riding by them, fake niggas dont like him
Real ones get inspired
By him, cause they know I climbed out the mud and got it
Cause they know I came out the dirt polished, hella racks in my pocket

[Hook]
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
Everywhere the money go, them bitches gon' follow
She only lovin' on the dollars
Watch her, baby girl diggin' in yo pockets, when you not watching
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Focused on the cash and not the ass, some my niggas spend, some I stash
When the summer end the furs attack, Minks is full length I let 'em drag
Cross the marble floor, I money dance, Ice blocks is piling on my hand
Watch is like the Vegas strip, I made it bitch
Underground, so I understand what its like to feel like being slept on for real
Watch 'em change face when the money peel, the game is cold, stainless steel
Unforgiven, no kidding, straight business making a killing
They want you dead because of how you livin'
Bitches giving you head cause the car you driven
We stars my nigga, they starving nigga
It's hard my nigga, let god be with us, we in the trenches stacking riches
Stand two steps ahead of them gold diggers
I was shown by them older niggas
That's why I'm colder than ya
I'm a high roller nigga, I swear it's like I'm frozen in here
Polar bear chills ballin' at will, too much dope out here to stand still

[Hook]
