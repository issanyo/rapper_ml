[Verse 1: Curren$y]
First off, don't be asking questions
You gon ride, you gon ride, just accept your blessings
Second step, watch how you flick your ashes
If you can't handle this gas I ain't about to pass it
It's a present to be in the presence
Every moment is precious, baby let us cherish
Say what you feel mama, you ain't gotta be embarrassed
Your eyes don't lie, I see how bad you want to let me have it
All evening we been smoking green and laughing
She, say my sense of humor wild attractive
My diamonds dancing in that street light traffic
I think it might be that
She said it ain't cause I rap, but I think all that's a trap
Still a fact we gon bust moves
Get stoned, have a Krush Groove
Play some fuck tunes, then she'll fuck too
Shower up, smoke a few I'm back in the coupe

[Hook: Lloyd]
What you gettin' in tonight
Can you spend the night
So promise if you spend the night
We gon' do all the things you like
For sure you might, girl I wanna know
Just how high do you wanna go
So girl don't be difficult
Just roll it, light it, please don't fight it

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
My '84 Caprice on chrome Zens
Hitting switches front end out the arena
She from New Orleans like me
Said she ain't never seen me
I've been rapping and traveling
My cousins in Cali been handling them
Parked the 'rado, then I'm off in that Benz wagon
Like a Miami vice dope deal when we throw them bags in
Monogram taggin' Louis Vuitton, Gucci's on, Goyard
Oh lord, they put some real niggas on
She look like Lisa Lisa, I'm gon take her home
Well not my actual house, you know what I'm talking 'bout
We gotta work up to all that, see if you really down
Summertime we throw free parties, represent my town
My crew G's, you stay cool and I'm gon bring you 'round
Play your part you gon earn a crown
Diamonds yellow and the liquor brown
Shots, shots till she going down, till she going

[Hook: Lloyd]
Baby only if the pussy tight
Can you spend the night
So promise if you spend the night
We gon do all the things you like
For sure you might, girl I wanna know
Just how high do you wanna go
So girl don't be difficult
Just roll it, light it, please don't fight it
