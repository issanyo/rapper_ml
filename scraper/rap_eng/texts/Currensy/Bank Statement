[Intro]
Yeah
In these times it's more gimmicks than lyrics
Yeah

[Verse]
In these times it's more gimmicks than lyrics
But I stay trill, knowing it might fall on deaf ears for real
Instagram shenanigans, gang precedent over skill
Anything to get you shine in these dark years
I've been reppin' Jet Life in the killin' fields
Some of us probably never make it out of here
Some of us don't really give a fuck, they, just givin' up
They not livin' they just alive, waitin' to die
Not I, no never, I want better than have-nots
Not for long 'cause we go-getters
And we gon' keep on gettin' until they catch us
Though we never slip I guess we gon' reign forever
We some motherfucker money makin' underground legends
Standin' on the furniture
Fuck these VIP sections, depositing the checks
Countin' up my blessings, plottin' on the next move
Sure as Raekwon, cheffin' 'em
And I'm praying for the best direction of my crew progression
For T.Y. to never switch up, that's all I tell him
For Corner Boy to know this shit could blow up in a second
It's lookin' like we sellin' dope though we slayin' records
With little to no radio presence
Could still flex on 'em with that mainstream leverage
Show 'em my bank statement, you know your life been threatened Nigga

[Outro]
Life
