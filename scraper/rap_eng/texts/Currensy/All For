[Intro]
What's it all for? What's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for?
Tell me what's it, what's it all for?
What's it all for? Tell me what's it all for?
What's it all for? Yea

[Verse 1]
Crosses get thrown
Cliques get torn apart before they even really start gettin' on
Small change stayin' in the way of big money
Smoke some with your OG, learn something
Wrist froze my soul ice cold, arm yellow gold
And cashed out a couple kilos, cut my grass low
Built my fence high 'cause I that heard snakes fly
Shut your operation down from the inside
Get tapped in the wire before you realize
Trappin' lied, scrammin' for dollar signs
You gamble with your life only could lose, one time
Shit, is it all worth the risk?
Gotta decide before you step into this, huh
Because the game don't wait, sideways
Burnin' rubber 'cause a nigga paper straight
I got some money put away and got some more on the way, shit

[Chorus]
What's it all for? What's it all for, all for
Money and the power, what's it all for?
Sleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for, all for
Money and the power, what's it all for?
Sleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?

[Verse 2]
Tell you how dollars start a world war
Level 6 Benz coupe, armored car
I really been mashin' down the Audubon
Worldwide gettin' all the Parmesan
Smokin' in the pool with my diamonds on
Ice water, what you call it though
She jumped in with nothing on
She know what she want

[Chorus]
What's it all for? What's it all for, all for
Money and the power, what's it all for?
Sleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for, all for
Money and the power, what's it all for?
Sleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?

[Outro]
Tell me what's it, what's it all for?
Tell me what's it, what's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for?
What's it all for? What's it all for?
Money and the power, what's it all for?
Sleepin' zero hours, what's it all for?
Show you how dollars start a world war
Level 6 Benz coupe, armored car
I really been mashin' down the Audubon
