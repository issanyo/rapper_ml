La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

[Intro]
Yeah, these planes they land on the water, got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload, no negotiation, one price, final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work pure, ain't nobody step on it

[Chorus]
These planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload, no negotiation, one price final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work pure, ain't nobody step on it
Count up that loot every morning (morning)
Ball hard, keep the scoreboard lit, point guard

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Doing dabs in the lab (lab), '76 house made of glass (house made of glass)
No rims, slidin' on facts, butter Timbs, butter raps
Butter leather seats nigga peel back the rag, top ride out pedal mash
To the hideout firin' up gas (gas), bitch that's what I'm 'bout
Runnin' through checks, you just runnin' your mouth (runnin' your mouth)
Not only collectin' checks, I been writin' 'em now (writin' 'em now)
Monopolize, we ride, customize in the South
488 Spyder when the stars come out (stars come out)
Every weekend we bringing new cars out (cars out)
'Cause all during the week we was in the workshop (workshop)
Gettin' that work out, over a million served (what else?)
Things you civilians wouldn't know about, word (word)

[Chorus]
These planes, they land on the water, got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload, no negotiation, one price, final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work clean, ain't nobody step on it (step on it)

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
Lil boat, nigga I been workin' for my 10 and 2s
Never ask a nigga what he finna do
Keep to myself for the most part, yeah
Quick to start a riot with [?] gun spark
'Cat do the dash on the highway (skrt)
'Cat do the dash on the street and the sideway
Nigga AP or [?], heat turnt up, on Dante
[?] need a bitch like Beyonce, maybe like '06 Ashanti
Give her good dick and a Klondike, neck so good, no tonsils
Damn, ridin' 'round town with the blammer
30 round clip, prey to God it ain't a jammer
Killin' these niggas, I'm feelin' like Dahmer
Wish my president was Bernie Sanders
Lil boat

[Bridge]
Yeah, these planes, they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Yeah, these planes, they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order

[Outro]
These planes, they land on the water, got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload, no negotiation, one price, final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work clean, ain't nobody step on it
Count up that loot every morning
Ball hard, keep the scoreboard lit, point guard, L
Ball hard, keep the scoreboard lit, point guard, yeah
Ball hard, keep the scoreboard lit, point guard
These planes, they land on the water
