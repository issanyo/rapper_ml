[Intro]
Imma keep it 100, you heard me?
Look

[Hook: Tre Pierre (x2)]
To be honest, y'all ain't even on my fuckin' level
To be honest, some of y'all dancin' with the devil
To be honest, y'all ain't even 'posed to be here
But since we all here, lemme tell you what's real

[Verse 1: Tre Pierre]
Most of y'all rappers be tellin' lies
Cause you really flip burgers when you said you had pies
To be honest, Ion' even wannna 'sociate you cause that fake shit contagious and most of y'all be patients
To be honest, the world before your eyes show lies
When well, you realize there's no such thing as time
To be honest, I believe we been here before
And the same thing goin' on, but it won't go
To be honest, I'm bout my profit, I'm not bout talkin'
I'm so honest, that I'm the truth, bitch I ain't lyin'
Check my watch, the perfect timin', my rollie shinin'
I been grindin', a whole lot, i don't stop tryin'
I'm so honest, I been rich before this rap shit
Don't get it twisted like Anita's, bitch I just be this
To be honest, the [?], and your surroundin leave you soundless
My Nina pop, come for ya pounds

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Currensy]
Honestly, I, probably spent at least 30 minutes tonight
Tryna decide what to drive
Fly so I can't pick, which one to dip
All vintage whip, perhaps I'mÂ  [?]
Porches, Ferrari horses, push button startin'
Could you please pass my lighter, darlin', reefer rockets launching
Got us all coughin', bossin' up
Tryna be a underground king, word to the pimp and the [?]
In the city where I'm from, I roll around catchin' stunts
At the red light, I make my green car j-jump
Just bein' honest cause I ain't gotta front
Do whatever I want
You try to copy what I done, you niggas just my rap sons
Happy Father's Day cards from some of them
I'm puttin' love in the wind because I didn't smell none when I first walked in
To he honest, only the [?] and my surroundins what I'm fine with

[Hook]
