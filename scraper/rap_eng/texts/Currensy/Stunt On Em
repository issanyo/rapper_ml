[Intro]
Every now and then I gotta stunt on em
Every now and then I gotta
Every now and then I gotta

[Verse 1]
Uh
The game is at an all time low
We still getting this cheddar tho
Iceberg jean jacket white t-shirt and a figaro
My girl got a brick cell phone and herringbone
Just an average day in the life of an extraordinary player
Getting paper from vocabulary
Staying high from fine like it grew on vines
Drove the stock Impala to Napa we sampling wines
This a appetizer sampler my nigga I let them try
A little dope get them hooked
Then I make them buy it by the book
We do juggs and that paper multiply
Cash rules everything around me my guy
Fuck you thought this was
Top shark sleeve Lacoste
My raincoat was a Nautica
Only talking bout it cause you brought it up
Every now then I gotta stunt on them

[Hook]
Every now and then I gotta stunt on them
Every now and then I gotta
Every now and then I gotta
Every now and then I gotta stunt on them
Every now and then I gotta stunt on them
Every now and then I gotta stunt on them

[Verse 2]
Open up the Ferrari trunk on them
Show them that's it's on the front on them
Show them ain't no love for them
Tried to bury me alive but I won't throw no mud on them
Instead I get bread live life to the fullest
Make them wish they was dead
But niggas too live like crew
Nigga bless who sneezed, ah-choo
Nigga got the fruit pack, Hi-Chew
Safari Air Max nice shoes
An underground nigga in the Wraith who knew
I took it all when I came through
Niggas balling like two on two
Pickup games Tyronne Lue

[Hook]
Every now and then I gotta stunt on them X6
