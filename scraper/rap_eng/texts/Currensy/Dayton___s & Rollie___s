[Verse 1: Fendi P]
Yellow gold match my Daytons these fuck niggas hatin' (they hatin')
Stack up my paper on top of more paper (top of more paper)
Amazing my grace, patiently waitin' (patiently waitin')
Triple gold cross lace, look at they faces (I saw it)
See they envy me
Jealousy have 'em won't murder me (murder)
I know certainly this Glock 23, you won't make through surgery
I purposely do this shit personally with no courtesy (no)
You heard of me I kill everythang, should call me Murder P (murder)
First degree, schedule one program see how [?] with me
Lyrically, dope and too raw, you just met OD (damn)
A whole key, revolving doors don't even need keys
My trap spot get [?] heroine
Honestly I been sure to quit, it just be calling me
The power you could get off this shit, forever live as king
Dayton dance, [?], hangin' all off my hand
All my bands, smell like the gas, real hustlers understand

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Roll with my dawgs, pitbulls and parolees
You call 'em a threat, I call them the homie
Seen him in the spot and this what he told me
You good up in here? I got my shit on me
Roll in the streets, stoned on my lonely
Go 13's on this [?] can't hold me
Rolex watches, Chevrolet boxes

Sky-Dweller, they just [?] problems
