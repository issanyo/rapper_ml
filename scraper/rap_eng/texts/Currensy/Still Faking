This nigga still mad the Lakers lost
Still on my shit
Nigga
Nobody else doing what I'm doing
Uh
I get into it, flow so intricate
Oh the beat so good I sound like an instrument
I don't rap about it unless I've been through it
Bitches call the phone arranging rendevous, intimate
Check the schedule and I can fit you in
Hit the broad once, never call agian
If you see me 'round the club don't ask if I can get you in
Cause you became a stranger the day after I banged ya, thank ya
Back on the beat like a cop
Though a five-o I'm not
Like an '84 Camaro Z28 I rock
Pilot of the plane, creator of this shit
My name is my name
G5 style I fly over the lane, ya'll clogging it
Bought my own ball, ya'll hogging it
Still after A. Marie
Cause anything is possible, just ask Kate G

Yeah
Just like that
Look what I've done in five months man
Made a name for myself
My name is on the streets
My name
Is my name
