What mean the world to me
Other than my god, my family and my music, would probably be my cars
My kicks and my louie scarves
I'm sick, when I rap I cough, call me mr good bars
I be wit cali ovar and we rip that cali O hard, but me im from the east
I parked a bunch o fancy cars on these misused streets
I ain't done a lot yet but my momma so proud of me
Ima break my back to see her sittin on a pile o cheese
Walkin around pettin my pockets for my impala keys
Found em in a sofa cushion wit a pack o easy widers
And two bags o purple kush
I even found a zippo lighter, im excited homie
I can't hide it, I can't wait to light it
Your girl in the cock cuz she tryna meet the pilot
My stock is steady risin, my top drop when im ridin
My volume at the highest
That’s the only that I can way I can hear the music
Cuz this motor ain't quiet
Don’t ask if its for sale homie, cuz you can't buy it
Damn nigga let me get a chance to drive it
My goal when I rap is to make listeners rewind it
And play it for their partners and say spitta got some nice shit
