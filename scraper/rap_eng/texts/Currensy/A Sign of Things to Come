[Verse]
They got pistols in the sofa cushion, mama watch how you sittin'
Them niggas in my brother apartment used to be trippin'
But I cherished every minute spent in it
Remember it like yesterday, them images is very vivid
Made me a colder nigga, as a youngster, roll with the older
And made sure that I did my shit just how they did it
Pulled up, hitting switches at any event or in the trenches
Its all the same, I'm heavily respected in the game
They all know my name, while rappers doin' free features
Trying to get back they chain, I'm rolling heavy Chevys
Mashing through the light rain, probably won't even put up the top
We on the move, they only get to touch us if we stop, bruh
Hit the block, kids tell one another that that's my car
I was just like you shorty, but you gotta grind hard
You ready for war, take it far, all heart
From the front porch to the stars, ain't far, just stretch your arms out
Stack it and stash it, you'll never fall off
Never give a label your masters,  record at all costs
Make them ideas real, make em appear
Get em off the vision board, get em right here
At the Bentley dealership like, let's make a deal
I bought two already, give me the playa price on this one
Yeah this Andretti, don't kiss and tell, let's make a mil
I take the wheel, baby with me, she trained to kill
And you know she will, with no hesitation
Put you haters on chill, still beautiful murderin' them photo stills
Rolls with the Don, say my hustle turned her on
Made us breakfast in the morns
(East Side)
(Just like airtime)
(All recruiting ?)
(While them other niggas lying)
