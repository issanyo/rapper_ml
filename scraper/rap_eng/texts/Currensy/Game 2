[Intro:]
(?) is to that original playa shit
Nananana
Preservation is to that original playa shit
Nananana

[Verse 1: Currency]
Preservation is to that original playa shit
Captain save a bitch wondering where his paper went
Gone with the wind tryna get this cone lit
Standin' in the middle of this cyclone strong
Stainless, mainstream paper underground, famous
Audio drug love, had catering at my arraignment
Celebratory floral arrangement
Sent to the judge when the case is dismissed
Cases of champagne, it's raining in here
Making millions, making memories and enemies
It'll kill ya, if you let it, never
I'm focused on better, I get it
Money fever, motherfucker you should catch it
I show ya how to take 10 G's and stretch it
20 more stacks, double that, put it all together
Like a puzzle, it's pieces to the hustle
Everything fit, it'll look like somethin'
Highed up in my house, got your bitch making muffins
She got four friends with her and my homeboys comin'
It ain't nothin', money over bitches

[Hook:]
Bend her over the safe with million dollars in it when I hit her
Money over bitches
Bend her over the safe with million dollars in it when I hit her
(They come around but they never come close to)
(They come around but they never come close to)
(They come around but they never come close to)

[Verse 2: LES]
Look, check, check, look
Seen it all with blind eyes, I stayed aware
Duckin' devils with fat asses and baby hair
Paint the picture, it ain't perfect but it's one you see
And go the hardest, your waters can never fuck with me
Real playa, check the favts and the stats
The only time you ever gonna see the racks is your racks
And at times I wonder why you niggas worship that
Same tit you praisin' got my partners murk the track
Now they caught up in the system, sons and daughters they miss 'em
Baby momma quit 'em, his partner, she fuckin' with him
Filthy way of livin', guess whose part of the cycle?
Niggas quick to bring ya down, shit they even killed Michael
Why you thinkin' you excempt? Just a crab in the bucket
And they gonna boil us all, so I'm ridin' like fuck it
Where the seasonin' nigga? Fuck your reasonin' nigga
Bigger picture isn't somethin' that I'm singing my nigga
When you can only get the 20 inch, cable is basic
Reality overrated, tried watchin' it but I hate it
All these bitches gettin' famous off the dick that they suck
And people really at home givin' a fuck?
Guess we shit outta luck

[Outro:]
