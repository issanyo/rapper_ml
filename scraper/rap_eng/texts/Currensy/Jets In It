(Curren$y) *Verse 1*
Vaulted ceilings
Countin' up what we made from this rap drug dealin'
Shooters weapons concealed 'em
But it's nothin' to peel 'em
If they get to feelin
The block had em' chillin' top drop
Ya boy sittin' front spot
Honeycomb wax wrapped around that OG anthrax
My mind blown, open up to new things
With that large money bring cars from yo' dreams
Mash that pedal, make that coupe sing
Performance cone
Serenate us all the way home
When I get there my chair will be a golden throne
Wrapped in the rarest fabrics, that only the royals own
The soil of new Orleans
I grew up and started ballin'
Homes just ate
I still scramble like I was starvin'
What is you n*ggas wantin
Push buttons startin' turn my car on
Keys open doors
Escape tunnels in the floor
All I ever did was serve it to em' raw, yet they want more

(Fiend) *Hook*
I was up at my brother's Stag
Was just 14 years old!
And no I ain't a murderer!
I'm out chillin and a killin' hoe
Jets in the motherf*cker
J-J-Jets in the motherf*cker
Count many never never get off
Soon as I light this we tourin'

(Mr. Marcelo) *Verse 2*
When I say I want it all, I want it all or nothin
I tend to stay high so I don't fall for nothin
Ay dam hustlin'
Turnin nothin to somethin'
My youngest OG is a socket because I'm pluggin
Boy, the streets, they love me because I plug em
Big dawg give it to em raw I don't cut em
3-6-9 I tend to roll with a dozen
Ex-drug dealer my car's clean as my money
Probably smell like a onion
In my own zone
The only time I'm runnin is if it's behind the money
You name it I done it
I be runnin the options
So anything I did I came away with a profit
Banked it, spent it, gave some to my partners
My hustle gotta n*gga money growin like cotton
I was switchin' work like I pitched for the pirates
CEO money I ain't even go to college

(Fiend) *Hook*
I was up at my brother's stag
Was just 14 years old!
And no I ain't a murderer!
I'm out chilling and a killin' hoe
Jets in the motherf*cker
J-J-Jets in the motherf*cker
Count many never never get off
Soon as I light this we tourin'
