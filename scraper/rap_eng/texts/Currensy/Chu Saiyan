[Verse]
Hit the block on 3 wheels, I'm ill
Jet Life in the house with the real deal
Fake gangsters get pinched, they will squeal
That's why I'm only in the trench with the krill
Second guessin', half step get you killed
My nigga you got's to chill
Moves I make got that mafia feel
Switch styles because suckers love to steal
Dabbling in your flow like it's they own
People thinking that's your shit when they hear somebody else on
They just trya get on, ain't nothing wrong
The machine force 'em to conform
This is the norm in the industry
Lil' homie, you've been warned about Rolexes and cars you been drawn
Can't knock it 'cause some of them same thangs I want
But I never trade my heart dawg, not a part for any of this
Material shit, I don't be trippin off it
The universe keep giving me gifts
Got the gift of flip, scribblin' in the chips
Jet Life get rich, leave the spot with a bad bitch
On my line, got a hook like a fish
I'm the young OG, who produce fresh looks
When I jumped off the porch the whole fashion world shook
