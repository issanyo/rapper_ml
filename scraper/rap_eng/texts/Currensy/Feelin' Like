[Intro: from "Super Fly"]
"Aw sweet Jesus man them junkies must of knocked a hole in your head"

[Verse 1]
Like a nigga selling dope
Investigation, surveillance, life under the scope
They waiting to see me fail, I’m waiting on this boat
Damier printed sails love, I got somewhere to go
Dress like I really didn't have no plans
Light Rolex, maybe a chain, t-shirt, sweatpants
Bumping that Juicy J Bands A Make Her
But she made it shake and I ain’t even have to pay her
And you know me, keep it OG, like the reefer and my papers
Got them suckers under guns infrared lasers
Me, I’m under the sun, sports car racing
Everyday we come up with some more amazing player shit

[Hook]
Straw in my Rosé Mo's when I step through the door
And I’m rolling up smoke everywhere I be
Feeling like I can have any bitch I want
Feeling like all these hoes in this bitch want me
Yeah, yeah
Straw in my Rosé Mo's when I step through the door
And I’m rolling up smoke everywhere I be

[Verse 2]
Wake up, thank the man I’m still alive
Freshen up, get dressed, pick which car I’ma drive
Backing out my driveway, automatic gates
Couple automatic assassins securing my estate
I don’t know what I done, niggas mad at me
I bought a couple nice things, thought you’ll be happy
But niggas wishing they hear that somebody kidnapped me
You wanna die cause your girl tryna get at me
Nigga stop, it’s a world full of money
You wasting time worrying bout mine, fool get on it
Mega grind several times I was told I would be next to shine
Until I said fuck it and I snatched mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When the club letting out I’ma pass in front
You all in your girl’s face hoping she don’t see
Pimpin', you can’t police her, she gon' do what she want
Love just wanna fuck and smoke some good ass weed
She in the beater, nothing else, cleaning my bathroom
I’m syncing my iPhone to show on my tv
Ain't even all the way on, niggas ain’t even seen
Nothing yet, Jet threat, fools, you hear me
Talking top Corvette, ZR1 top speed
It’s a check at the finish line every dime I need
Every dime don’t spend, hounds them hoes be
Out to get them so firstly I get me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Straw in my Rosé Mo's when I step through the door
And I’m rolling up smoke everywhere I be
Feeling like I can have every bitch I want
Feeling like all these hoes in this bitch want me
When the club letting out I’ma pass in front
You all in your girl’s face hoping she don’t see
