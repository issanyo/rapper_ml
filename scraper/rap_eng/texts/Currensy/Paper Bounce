[Chorus]
Paper on top of paper, stack paper some more
Lookin for place to put it like where this gon go?
Flows we create em change em like switching up clothes
Once they bite our styles we dont want em no more

[Verse]
Sick, on my life they got me sick
I can't get on the grip without em on my dick
I can't quit, i got some more on my to purchase list
I hit my wrist up, lit my shit up, 50 clips
Thats your beamer on my wrist homie but thataintthis
Think its just about this flossing shit but i uplift
Tell my youngins how i got all this, they learnin quick
I see em swingin round them corners in all kinda shit
Now im him, top dog in the yard when i walk in
Its like the whole earth pause
Against the physics laws, livin large, jernts lit
Fatest cuban cigars, you think you seen it all

[Chorus]
