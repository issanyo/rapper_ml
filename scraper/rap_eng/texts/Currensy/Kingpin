[Verse 1]
I can make cocaine
Bitches getting high from my music
I just left the studio
I swear I treat that bitch just like a crack house
I put that work in, pull them stacks out
Now I'm riding round in that Ferrari
Fifty racks in the Joyrich backpack
I turn any situation to a party
I be making cocaine
Dealer money from this mothafuckin' rap thang
I get back to the studio
I tell my bitch bring a ounce and a pack of cones, hold on
I be writing cocaine
Raps every dope bitch wanna throat mane
I just left the studio
Bitch want a G nigga come ride through
She put it on her life, she in love with me
Baby girl just in love with what that dick do
Her homegirl said I was official
So know she coming for herself to see if it's true, wait
I be writing cocaine
Raps at the crib, chilling watching Scarface, yea
Got a bitch rolling up
Now I'm smoking while that ho making pizza rolls
OG kush put you in a sleeper hold
If you a rookie then my doobies you don't need to smoke
Round here we was raised by the G code
Round here it ain't said, you already know
That I can make
...Audio dope mane, L
Origina-tor
...Of this audio dope game, mane
I can make...
