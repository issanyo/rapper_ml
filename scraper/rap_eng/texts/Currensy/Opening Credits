[Verse: Curren$y]
It was right around the time
I thought I had to move back with my mom
I had to sell my first lowrider
Halfway to the top, went to sleep, woke up at the bottom
They turned off my lights, I lit candles and I plotted
Got it before, getting it again shouldn't be a problem
Every month dropped something
Then the Double X-L put a nigga on the cover
Made the freshmen ten like a year before my brother Wiz
Rap hustling and we rocked e'rywhere we went
Then I tried to start to start a business with Damon
Charged that to the game, learned some thangs
I thought I earned some change
But fuck it, mayne, it's all the same, I'd live the same life again
If it don't kill ya, it just make you realer
Stepping into the house shoes of a big wheeler
Always wrote my own rules; this Jet Life, nigga
Remembering when I couldn't smoke in the buildings
Now the executives is dancing on the ceiling
I've been moving around, moving around trying to get it
