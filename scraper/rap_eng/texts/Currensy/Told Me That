[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh
96 Impala double S like a yacht on wheels
Paint fresh left the interstate wet
Now watch me smoke and chill same time get a check
That's a walk through and I get paid for every step
Got my golf hat and my white t-shirt gold cuban
I'm not trying too hard but you can tell I know what I'm doin
Sliding off radar
That's Pablo and Gustavo in the race cars
Make money and make war
Fuck a sucka nigga take me for
Real ones take it far
They thought I slept but that was one of my best tricks
I came back in that matte six Spitta going bat shit

[Hook: Curren$y] (X2)
Money make them act different my nigga told me that
Keep your mind off them bitches my nigga told me that
Stacking mine every penny
You can ball out but if you spend it hustle it right back

[Verse 2: Starlito]
It's Lito
Grind hard my momma on her third foreign
Chitlin circuit but I'm living like I'm world tourin
Treat every last one like it's my first one
Nigga I've been balling since the nerf sponge
Used to get alerts on my chirp when the purp would come
Still got a pound on me now but I ain't serving none
I prefer the strong loud like my burglar alarm
Whip like my bitch I talk to her just to turn her on
If it ain't bout the cash I'll pass like 3rd and long
Pass by driving fast crash if I turn wrong
Burning cones murder songs we do this shit for show
Jetlife grind hard we been cruising since we was broke
And they say...
It's Lito

[Hook: Curren$y] (X2)
Money make them act different my nigga told me that
Keep your mind off them bitches my nigga told me that
Stacking mine every penny
You can ball out but if you spend it hustle it right back

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
It ain't a game it really ain't a game
Bitches and champagne pistols and gold rings
Some chose to slang some chose to bang
Some chose to rhyme some niggas ain't do a thang
They was froze real ones jumped off the porch
They didn't go they wonder why they don't have dough
While I'm rolling diamonds and gold on me all day
928 S like Scarface
Flip up headlights I drive like I'm in the race
Driving like I'm trying to escape
They say living like this ain't safe
But, I couldn't see it no other way
What you know about it

[Hook: Curren$y] (X2)
Money make them act different my nigga told me that
Keep your mind off them bitches my nigga told me that
Stacking mine every penny
You can ball out but if you spend it hustle it right back
