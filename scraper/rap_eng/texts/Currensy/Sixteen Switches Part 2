[Hook x2]
Sixteen switches still smoking strong on them bitches
Got the Chevy sitting looking like something wrong with it

[Verse 1]
Uh, word to this 8-ball hanging from my key ring
Spitta got a thing for mary jane, and Dana Dane's turning lane
Back bumper scraping, purple ghost flames
Only see it when the light hit it right
Painted by them pros mane cause I know where to go mane'
High roller sitting low, could enter it in a show, fo' sho'
Chief exporter of that audio dope, as if you didn't know
These niggas try to copy my flow, I switch up on them though
Bitches want the real
Them hoes see me, they be tryna' run up like a hill
I be like chill

[Hook]
