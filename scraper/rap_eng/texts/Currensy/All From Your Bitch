Life is good. Shout out to DC Shoes

[Hook]
I got a new set of rims and a flat screen for the crib
[D] All from your bitch
I got two G’s to get my homeboy for his rent
[D] All from your bitch
I got enough money to go and get a pound of that purp
[D] All from your bitch
[D] All from your bitch
Yes, I got it
[D] All from your bitch

[Verse 1]
Homebody, you getting played like an asshole
Because your girl keep dipping in your cash flow
Who paid for the screens in the Range Rover?
Who paid for the Ds on the 64?
I’ll tell you who bought it, you did
Damn, homie, why you looking clueless?
Shawty been tricking off stupid
And I probably got more for Christmas than you did
Living like a gigolo
Saks Fifth Ave., your girl buying me winter clothes
Tank full of gas in the Jaguar, thank you, ho
Or should I say, thank you, bro
Because it’s all on you
She supposed to buy for some of my homies, too
And my cousin Lil Will need a Power Wheel
And I’m gonna get that all from your bitch
