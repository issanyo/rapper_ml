Are we on the air?
Yes you are
Hello ma
Uh, I'd like to hear a new beat on the request line
Ok you got it, coming up

[Verse 1]
Uh where haven't we been yet
Where haven't we been yet
Uh yeah
As the Earth rotates and my name grows bigger
How many women wanna fuck this nigga
How many suckas hating on Hot Spitta
A mathematician would have to come up with the figures
I came up
Quicker than others, now they're catching feelings
The closer to the deal I get, the more bullshit I'm in
Pay it no attention, I'm just focused on my business
Gearing up for the winter
Copping hooded chinchillas
Look how I supe the styles up with the stunting on them niggas
That's why they don't feel me
Add another nigga to the list of bitch boys claiming they wanna kill me
Guilty as a motherfucker if the charge is
Refusing to sell out as an artist
I represent the south on behalf of New Orleans
Even when I'm in the booth I hear the street talking
But them pussy cats don't want me to send them dogs in
Yeah

[Hook]
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf

[Verse 2]
FS Jets where haven't we been yet
Brung my brothers to the lot, bought a dozen Corvettes
Throw some rims on them bitches
These ain't like yours
All of these (?)
Word up
Roll up something, we can smoke it in the Porsche truck
Hear the plane engines and you know its us
Turn it up, let it bump, let it bang
Word to my skating homie Joe
What my homie claim?
Jets over everything
Events like this call for champagne
Toast to my haters, ya'll a major inspiration
But watch what you're saying
Cause my niggas will hear it before it even get to me
And the issue'll be handled before I knew it was beef
But that ain't really me
But that's how its gotta be
Even when a nigga in a coupe I can hear the streets talking

[Hook]
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
You will wanna keep your negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf

The planes got it
Uh
