[Hook]
Fo niggas in the low rider
Smoking gas, screaming jet life every time they past
I’m the one behind the wheel, mind on a mil
Wondering how long could it last

[Verse 1]
Never been a square one from square one
All about that there, caking layers
Count it up and weight it, fair is fair
I must say I’m feeling quite debonair on this speeding boat in this night air
Transport this cargo rare
Just recorded these, rapping like package keys
Higher than the flying trapeze
Might give you the roaches when I leave
Closest you get to smoking like Gs
Freeze, it’s AOB
What could you do for me?
All on a bitch, but we can’t all do this
Some of you niggas a simp, water whip, camera pimps
I’m here to close the lid on all that shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
One foot in, one foot out
I can’t get out, I can’t get in
As the wheel of fortune spin, torturing men
Find my pot of gold, same time lost friends
Fell out with some niggas as my ship came in
Now I’m smooth sailing and they barely can swim
Try Vitola, Testarossa pop-up head like showed him
The road was golden and they didn’t know it
Like you gave up when the race was almost over
You could’ve placed and won the trophy but you chose to fold up on me
That’s a luck, I can’t afford to give a fuck
With all these bitches trying to get it, I’m too busy living
To be concerned with suckas who don’t earn
What I earn, you just a threat to yourself, you'll learn
As the world turn, the joint burns
Time machine on Dayton thirteens, I'm the one sturrin
Sucka scared, better cop some insurance
Niggas in the van on yo block, word to Big Worm

[Hook x2]

[Outro: The Godfather]
Hyman Roth: Make sure that everybody sees the cake before we cut it. When a man comes to this point in his life, he wants to turn over the things he's been blessed with, turn them over to friends. As a reward for the friends he's had, and to make sure that everything goes well after he's gone. I want all you to enjoy your cake
