One time for T coming through and brining this beat
Push your friends to the limit
Uh

I do not fuck with no hip-hoppers
Jeans too skinny for money (?)
Land all alone in a helicopter
Tell the pilot to let me fly it
Smelling like I smoked a pound of (?)
I rolled up a doobie for everybody
Homie its nothing, you know I got it
Andretti (?) keep the shots popping
Fuck with the boy and you weed copping
I got the one that you need partner
Grind that shit up, sprinkle keef on top of it
Your girl want a handful like Cindy Lauper
Your bitch was impressed with my mocha shower
Ride in the S, she don't want a (?)
My 'tel got a view of the Eiffel Tower
And I'm in this motherfucker watching Power
Wait
Rest in peace Pimp C, Cadillac wood whip

Outsiders
Car hoppers
Drug watchers
Jaw droppers
Open the door, let your bitch slide in
She wanna see how big my house is
But the hotel where we got down in
Pound it in her, I got a pound to twist
(?) I got a lot of it
Award winning and I'm proud of it
Hip-hoppers, nope
I do not fuck with no hip-hoppers
Jeans too skinny for money (?)
Land all alone in a helicopter
Tell the pilot to let me fly it
