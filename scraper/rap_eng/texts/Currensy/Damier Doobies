I be fly out there
You be in the crib
Changing a hundred times
With the bubble guts
Nervous about what I'mma wear
Queeny ass niggas sitting in a king's position
Fuck out the throne
Might Kong thats my chair

Jet wings been fly
Since Pimp C cop'd his first Byzantine
My niggas who been had change
They know what that mean
Cuz they been had change and those type of things
Keep fresh bars laced with green
Irish Spring
Coach my team right

Hoes encroaching
Approaching
For proceeds

Fakin like they know me
Hot Spitta not the hospital bitch

Verse 2
I be high out there
Walkin round Walmart
Open the slip-n-slide
Turn the aisle to a waterpark
Neighbors wake up
Come outside when my car start
454 roaring
7 o'clock in the morning
Takin 5 on cloud 9 if you looking for him
Tropicana Pomegranate Lemonade for an OG
Arrow in a shoebox on the Jordans
Had elephant print around the borders and the corners
It don't make sense tryna pose opposition to the Jets
Fuck around get mangled in the engines
Not pretty

To put it down for my city
We just chillin
Blowin trees to the ceiling
My name Curren$y
