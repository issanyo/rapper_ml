[Hook]
All I wanna do is smoke weed and stay high

[Verse 1: Dreamshow]
Fly planes across the country
Think about Eagle City
Think about the marching mountains
Think about the different Karl Blau songs
Think about everything inside your head...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dreamshow]
I might stay home, cuz I hate the life
All I wanna do is smoke weed and stay high, stay high
And that's what I'mma do
Your homie Strick told you dude
Finish your breakfast
And that's what I'mma do
Take you back to the dude in the Lexus
Fast forward the jewels and the necklace

[Verse 3: Curren$y]

Uh, one time for the lifers, two times for my lighter
Three times for my folk, slammed outside on them gold and chrome wires
You could hit a bong in a elevator and never be higher
Than a perma-high chevy driver
Baby girl a rider, concealed half a pound of that fire
Saint Elmo, sticky icky velcro
Can you get a hit? Hell no, what you ask for?
On the seashore, stoned in my shell toes, holmes

[Verse 4: Dreamshow]
I might take a trip
I might touch down in LA
I might eat indian, smoke some weed after
I might walk down the street, smoke some weed after
I might walk down the street, do do do do do do
Walk through the streets, do do do do do do do
