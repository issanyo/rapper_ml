[Intro]
Purps on the beat
And I know what they waitin' on
And I know why they hatin' on
Should be happy I made it for 'em
No congratulations for 'em

[Verse 1]
How you wanna play it?
Homie, you could weigh it
Fishscale, it's all there, leave it or take it
And it sells itself, fool, I can't make it
State still, I been jumpin' out the gym lately
Tryna be humble and get money, but they still hatin'
So I said "fuck it", and start stuntin', they really can't take it
Pardon my Bentley, [?] interior parchment
Peacock blue carpet, the shit flawless
Met a bad thang from Florida, baby girl was gorgeous
She know how to make that money, duckin' Coast Guard at boat launches
Speedboats, duck between two dock barges
Audio kilos on it, we gon' make a fortune off it, ha

[Hook]
And I know what they waitin' on
And I know why they hatin' on 'em
Should be glad that I made it for 'em
No congratulations for 'em

[Verse 2]
Wallabee Clarks, the streets that I walk
Poisonous darts, strip you apart, lay you in chalk
Unless you play smart, follow your mind, also your heart
The perfect balance is such a challenge to find
Reward myself with a trip to Paris, ease my mind
I'm on that weed in the breeze like a wind chime
Finna get mine like double-time, lunch line
Two scoops, and a cup of juice bitch
Extra fries, fuck it
Keep stuntin', and my whole life super-sized
Lord, please help us survive what ever niggas get into tonight
Life like a movie that your boy seen several times
Even though I know how it ends, I'll do it all again

[Hook]
And I know what they waitin' on
And I know why they hatin' on 'em
Should be glad that I made it for 'em
No congratulations for 'em
