And you can keep whatever talking was already on there
Yeah
Jets nigga
I know niggas like
He just did something
He just put a tape out two days ago
(?)
I got to do something to get home in time, the game is on

Carve up the streets like a Thanksgiving turkey
In a class by myself like I went to school mad early
Bitches see my ice dripping, they thirsty
Want to drink from the fountain of fly
Such an awesome guy
Symbol of independence like the 4th of July
Cruise an old school Porsche, this a 959
Rocking my Larry Johnson (?)
Ten coupes in a line
Your bitch giving head in the ride
We passing her car to car like a jar, grey poupon
Suckas start, I fall off
Cause I move on
Cut it out like a coupon
I gave niggas rhyme patterns
And made up new ones
Tired of being slept on
Spitta ain't a futon
Bad bitches drool on my magazine pictures
Like cases on bed pillows
After wild nights of heavy fucking and mad liquor
Plus the fact that I'm Spitta only made her give it up quicker
But that don't mean that she's a groupie
But it do mean that she know how to seize opportunities
And make moves with a G
Now she's shopping for bags to carry her skis
Whatchu though, we was lame
And the airplanes was only logos on the Tees?
We got access, any minute we could leave
No boarding passes, e-tickets we don't need
Mama you rocking with the Jets
Even if you've neve been a fan of the team in the National Football League
Yeah

Jets nigga
I done lost count
To be honest
I done put out like four tapes
So I guess this number five
Yeesh
