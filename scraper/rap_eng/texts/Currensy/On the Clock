Yeah X6

[Hook]
Ferrari with the spider top
Frozen Fiji bottles in my watch
I stay on the clock I'm always on the clock
Soon as I open my eyes, I'm at my fucking job
911 with the targa top
Frozen Fiji bottles in my watch
I stay on the clock I'm always on the clock
Soon as I open my eyes, I'm at my fucking job

[Verse 1: Corner Boy P]
And no I don't take a day off
Balling like my niggas in the playoff
Leanin' in Ruth's Chris, I'm dripping steak sauce
Oh that's your baby mama
Nigga you still a little boy
Trapping hella hard up like Adderalls
Seventeens, triple gold tough as corduroys
Young nigga flip a pack and break his family off
Just like the trapping brought a car and parked it in my yard
Homie all on my line like he short an onion
Believe the nerve of this nigga, Mr. short money
I told my bitch this morning this my last Phantom
Regal cleaner than a Beamer but I want a Phantom

I stay on the clock, I'm always on the clock

911 with the targa top
Frozen Fiji bottles in my watch
I'm on the clock, I stay on the clock
Soon as I open my eyes, I'm at my fucking job

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Money to blow
I stay on the on the go, cause I want more
The records is dope
The boost off the stove, I'm letting em go
But not for the low
You pay for quality that's fosho
I stand by what I provide
Muthafuck that 9-5, 2/47 365
Homeboy thats how I grind
Fly shit I gots to drive, I flat out buy
You'll be paying notes until you die
But never I, that story there not mine
I'm laid up mountain high
Built me a condo in the sky
Park my Chevys in a long line
Couldn't fit em in the picture
I turned my cellphone to the side
At least I tried, to give y'all fools
A glimpse at some real pimps
Taught yo bitch how to crack lobster
Showed yo bitch how to peel shrimps
