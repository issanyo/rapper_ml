So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

[Verse 1 : Big KRIT]
Yeah, yo, my digital dash, as I mash on the gas
Don't know where I'm going fast, but I'm going there
Stop at the club, forever sure there's some hoes in there
Shaking they ass, looking for players with dough to share, but that ain't me though
Before I trick on a bust-it baby, I'm outta the do'
If you are looking for saving shawty, I'm not your hero
More like a guide
I can take you where you want, would you look in my eye?
Like you supposed to, cold enough to froze ya
Talking bout that pimping you already been exposed to
Far from being sober, let's travel into space while
Puffing on this Yoda, glowing like a lightsaber
Doing what the grownups do
Be grateful that this game was bestowed upon to you
Cause backstabbing betrayers divide, don't listen to
Cause they front, but they don't, do what I do
Cause they will never ever be pimps

[Verse 2 : Killa Kyleon]
Laid back on that butterscotch
Got my paint lookin' peppermint
Pull up pacin on pokers, puffin' that purple it's evident
Smell the scent I can see the moon and the stars in my evidence
Louie V don't see haters no focus cuz they irrelevant
Comin' thru like the president/Wave at my boppers n droppers
I let my trunk do the jump n they flag us down n they stop us
Flock us like waka. Like tv shows they watch us. you see these hoes?
Mesmerized like khalifa Pulled up in a slab do you see these fours
This ain't no Taaka, this purple drink. Do you see me pour?
And my cup got them double stacks like that X/do u see me roll?
Paint wet like it's aroused,So high i can kiss the clouds
I roll up them sour flowers and smoke till I'm lookin Yao
I'm stuck on this country shit I'm southern just like the college
Neck bones, cornbread, candy yams, and my greens collard
Crawlin just like a toddler pradas pushin them pedals down
Jackers keep me in magneto mode, I keep that medal 'round

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Curren$y]
I be obliged if you stepped outside
Smokin' that bum ass shit bitch
You get no play in this ride
Butta' soft high
They built many 'vettes after mine but I think they did it best in '89
Idlin' at the red light mindin' my business
Holdin' my weed low with a slight crack in my windows
Playin' all three of my mirrors
I ain't nervous
But I'm certain that them devils tryin' to get me
Cause I'm swervin' banging curbs
And they can't stand to see me with it
But it don't stop just provoke me
More to drop my top
Now be planetarium status
Flickin' ashes in the big dippa'
You ain't as high as me mista
Eye screwin' your sista' from a fifty foot distance
Now she missin' caught up in a twista', Tropicana
Pour me up a glass of tang
Roll up some of that NASA, mane
