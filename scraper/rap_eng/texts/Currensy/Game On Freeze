[Intro]
It's exactly 4:20 P.M. too
Niggas probably thought that's the beginning bars but they not

[Verse 1]
Mo' paper, mo' haters, that's a known fact
That's why some niggas get on
They leave their town they never come back
I never done that
I understand that position 'cause stardom make you a target
They starvin' in my city
But I'm slidin' in that Wraith, angel on the hood
I made it on by God's grace, no enemies made it through
Gettin' high behind them gates
'Bout to install a fountain in the livin' room
I'm higher than the moon

[Chorus]
Niggas tryna put my game on freeze (game on freeze)
Small thing to a giant, it's nothin' to me (nothin' to me)
I'm high beneath these palm trees (these palm trees)
'Bout to take over Wall Street (Wall Street)
Niggas tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze, game on freeze)
Haters tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze, yea, yea)
Bitches tryna put the game on freeze (game on freeze)
Small thing to a giant, it's nothin' to me (nothin' to me)
Niggas tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze)

[Verse 2]
New studio built, fully equipped
I'm up in here 'round the clock wrappin' bricks
Me and Rich on the quest like Johnny and Hadji
Coupe Maserati, cop that for my downest mami's
You never see me drive it
Ferrari shorty but I'm always low ridin'
Bitches like to see Gs, hit switches
My life is excitin', my life is enticin'
Feds buildin' dossiers and files about me (files about me)
But I'm straight, you know my paper got me

[Outro]
Haters tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze, yea)
Niggas tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze, yea, yea)
Haters tryna put your game on freeze (game on freeze)
Bitches tryna put the game on freeze
Jet Life, Jet Life
Jet Life, nigga yea
Jet Life
