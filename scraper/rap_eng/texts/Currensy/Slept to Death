[Intro: Curren$y]
Bullet holes through the pillowcase, you slept to death

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Bullet holes through the pillowcase, you slept to death
We up, we jets, stay baked and fresh, look at how I step
Out these Air Max blending with my sweats, live like '95
TV in the Pathfinder, watch New Jersey drive
Thinking about a heist thinking about my life, getting high
This shit nice, I can't lie, but it came from a grind
This wan't overnight, this was over an extended period of time
They tried to throw me in the box, cover it with rocks
I expanded on my house, purchased some mo' drops
Legal hustle Andretti OG the cash crop
Throat the smoke in the spot, come and see us, we out
I need you to spot, low rider low top, three wheel up the block
Throw up a jet life, a peace sign and then an east side
Stare in the mirror, turn the lights off and say me name three times
And I appear through the smoke: Andretti, Andretti, Andretti and a Nissan
Skyline, we often missed the child crazy high
Me and Statik got them coupes in traffic
Them bitches looking at us but we duck 'em if they goofy acting
Baby I'm a hundred everywhere your dude be lacking
Any time you see me, you witnessing magic happen
[?] perfectly matching my Phantom

[Verse 2: Cousin Stizz]
Yeah, ayy
Bullet holes through the pillowcase, you slept to death
Rookie of the year still be moving with the vets
Stizzy from the bottom, how we out there with the jets
Cause he don't be impressed, he was always thinking next
Low riders, that Spitta style I need more exotic
You make foes when you hold profit
You make business and you make millions
You lose money when you chase women
And I ain't tripping long as fam eat like Thanksgiving
Ain't willing to let up the motor
My moms said it'll move slower but that ain't gon' hold us over
Your bitch fell in love cause the ice I'm rocking polar
She know where I'm from, ain't no way I'm getting colder
Keep the car running homie if you pulled us over
I lost my brother that way, a lesson from the corner
One minute you here, the next day you a goner
So I'ma sing your favorite song whenever I ain't sober
Real life
