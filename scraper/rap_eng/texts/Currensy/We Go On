[Intro]

Yea
Trademark Presents
Da Skydiver
You already know what it is
If you don't you should

[Verse 1: Trademark Da Skydiver]

Yea, I get in'em like Venom
My swag so official I'm rocking designer denim
My style unorthodox how I flow along to the rhythm
Just give me the beat & watch me lace it up like tennis
Member of a fly circle, we trophy cup winners
No room for beginners, lames, unfly, or pretenders
I snuck in the game crept through the door that said enter
Blocked from backstage but now I'm front & center
Here to deliver these lyrics to make you remember
I'm vicious when I'm spitting my nigga don't get it twisted
You know I'm the truth in the booth
That's why you listen at every sentence
& memorize every line mentioned
& it's true I'm addicted to shoes & bad bitches
On the highway red lining the koop with the roof missing
Let 'em haters hate we don't even pay attention
Ima shine the same time my diamonds & jewels glisten

[Hook]

Here I go
& I swear it's my year
Get it clear
I ain't going nowhere

Here I go
& I swear it's my year
Get it clear
I ain't going nowhere
We go on & on & on & on
& on & on & on & on
We go

[Verse 2: Curren$y]

Fuck boys wondering if they bitch next
Ugh You know

Yea & I'm on it
Made a lifetime outta one magic moment
Everyday I wake feel like Saturday morning
Cause I've got shit to do but laugh at Shaggy & Scooby Doo
Get dressed slip into shoes that share hues with Rubik's cubes
You & your homies in the game
I got your bitch in the nude
Oh wait it's a 442 cut dawg
My UK broad send me a zip so we living in the London fog
Sucker niggas I don't fuck with y'all
Like free lifestyle rubbers I don't trust ya
JET nigga got JET bitches with us
She whipping my ride, counting my ones, taking my pictures
I get high describe the trip in all my lyrics
I get fly can teach you how to pick your denim
Real estate cake really stacking ranch chips
Balling on Mars Space Jam shit

[Hook]
