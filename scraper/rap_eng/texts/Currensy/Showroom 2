[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Bitch if you get in here, you can't smoke blunts
My flow sick they say my pockets got the mumps
G pen flavors, OG wax the lumps
Dashboard 12 gauges, momma no pump
Car talk, I got what them bitches want
I bust their eye's when I arrived out front
Sky high, to get out I had to jump
But really tho', we hella low, scrapin' speedbumps
Now momma, don't front like you ain't coming over
You remember last time, you kept cumming over and over
Several times, next thing you knew, it was morning
Wanted to call work tell them you wasnâ€™t going
But I told you, like I tell all of 'em
Less huggin' mo hustlin', build a money mountain
Put a bed on top and we gon' fuck in it
I show you what's up then
Waterfalls in our backyard, we let the mermaids swim
Gone get in

[Hook: Curren$y]
Show 'em better than I could tell 'em (x3)
They gon' feel me (x3)
Nigga's I came up with switching up
Say they gon' kill me
But I don't give a fuck sincerely

(Lalalala) (Lalalala) (Lalalala)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Show 'em better than I could tell 'em, they gon'
Nigga's I came up with switching up, say they gon'
Riding trough the streets hustlers getting payed on
Start shining, all of the ladies look your way homes
Nigga's high 'till we die, we gon' stay blazed on
Smoking mo for our loved one's after they gone
Fool ride through the street, hustlers just getting payed on
Start shining too bright, you'll be the one to hate on
They stole the homie Lil Snupe, I'm still feeling played homes
Tear drops and weed ashes as I'm dealing with this madness

(Lalalala) (Lalalala) (Lalalala)

[Hook: Curren$y]

Fuck 'em, let me hear it
