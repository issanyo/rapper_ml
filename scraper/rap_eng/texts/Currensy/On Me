[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I got a cup full of mud and a blunt full of kush and my Benz gas tank on E (empty)
I got a blue 50k (gwala), a Glock .45 and half an ounce to smoke on me (hey, hey)
I got this red thick bitch and that pussy real good but she love to smoke all a nigga weed (goddamn)
I got a blue 100k (yeah), black .50 cal and an half a zip to smoke on me (uh-huh)

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
I got it on me, I got it on me right now
I got it on me, 5 chains, I’m iced out
Yeah, they on me, yeah, these bitches on me right now
Vercace motorcycle jacket cost eleven thou
Aye, pull up, pull up, pull up
These foreigns back to back
These little niggas stuntin’
These little niggas flexin’
Aye, rocks in my necklace, gelato, my preference
I’m eatin’ like a motherfucker but I’m going back for seconds
Uh, uh
Everybody ‘round me a made man (yeah)
Every nigga ‘round me a paid man (uh-huh)
The conversation ain’t ‘bout money, then why conversate? (wait)
The conversation ain’t ‘bout money, then why conversate?

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I got a cup full of mud and a blunt full of kush and my Benz gas tank on E (empty)
I got a blue 50k (gwala), a Glock .45 and half an ounce to smoke on me (hey, hey)
I got this red thick bitch and that pussy real good but she love to smoke all a nigga weed (goddamn)
I got a blue 100k (yeah), a black .50 cal and a half a zip to smoke on me (uh-huh)

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Married to the hustle, gave it my last name (my last name)
Came down the aisle wearin’ a tux and 7 chains (7 chains)
My car outside, bitch, that’s the old school Range (that’s the old school Range)
1997, I set that bitch on thangs (bitch on thangs)
In the crowd, on a cloud, smokin’ my own strain (smokin’ my own strain)
Andretti OG roaches in the ashtray (roaches in the ashtray)
Went to Memphis, I shipped my Ferrari and a Wraith (skrt)
I bet a Dolph a pound on who’s Rolls-Royce would win a race (skrt)
Mr. Smoke-it-Down, Mr. Money-in-the-Safe (money in the safe)
Pimpin’ Andretti, and other alias names (other alias names)
I could break it down show you this shit is not a game (shit is not a game)
I could break it down you gotta adjust to my slang (gotta adjust to my slang)

[Chorus: Young Dolph]
I got a cup full of mud and a blunt full of kush and my Benz gas tank on E (empty)
I got a blue 50k (gwala), a Glock .45 and half an ounce to smoke on me (hey, hey)
