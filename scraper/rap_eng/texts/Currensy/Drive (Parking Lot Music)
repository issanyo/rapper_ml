Don't drink & drive so my Four don't crash x4
Nigga half way home and my cell is still blowing up
While the wait, chasing paper, got my dream girl rolling up
Don't drink & drive so my...

[Verse]
All about the paper nigga, fax machine
Diamonds in my pinky ring
Details, just the small things in the big scheme
In the end we'll reign supreme over everything
Switching lanes, gold Dana Danes make them Chevys swing
Can't complain, I been hopping planes, living out my dreams
Hella high, but I'm always focused When I'm on the Scene
Crispy jeans, boutique Ice Creams
Extra clean, she wanna be next to me
Homie just let it be, drop the top, pulled off on 3
Like the perfect (SKRT!) Description of a fucking G
I got it on me, I got it on me right now
I'm pulling up with the top down
Smoking the loud in front of ya house

[Hook]
Don't drink & drive so my Four don't crash x4
Nigga half way home and my cell is still blowing up
While the wait, chasing paper, got my dream girl rolling up
