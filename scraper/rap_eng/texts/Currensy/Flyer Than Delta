[Intro: Curren$y]
They catch feelings, we catch flights
JET Life
Yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we don't save 'em no
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
I can help ya, ho's reaching for the wings but we don't

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Not do I love them ho's, hell no
Now soak that G game, lace it up like some shell toes
Of all in a laws bumping Jym Crow
Baby's Mama drama featuring Too Short, in a super sport
All sorts of bitches have payed sky boxes
Just witness my weed stash, I'm sitting on grass like a picnic
And I'm not stingy with it bitch, this that rapper weed though, with caution you should hit it
JETS nigga multiply, like midnight snacking gremlins
Or hundred spoke chrome wide spinning
That gives my baby the high way of play pen
Ride past the spot where its popping but ain't no stopping
As my popularity gain, more haters go to plotting
They watching I dont worry, I see the trap they set for me
20 20 no chinky and sour diesel blurry
Vodka in my Hawaiian punch, yeah that's the fist of fury
Murder the track and play it back for the jury, hell

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no

[Verse 2: Neako]
Rolls gold, color my champagne
Changed the game, made The World my main campaign
Bomb bitches and bomb weed, its fair game
While your main bitch just study my Nike air game
She been accustomed to purchase a couple air max customs
Nigga picture me bluffin', I gave 'em to my man, I don't wear 'em
Nigga's be starin' like the wheels on the Bonneville all wheels act accordingly
Bape socks keep a nigga walking like, underneath his Jordan Nikes
Shit, book a shell then I board a flight
Smokin' on this blue dream
I can see your moves like a new screen
I can dip that Bruce Lee swing
I walk past them nigga's who less G
Prolly home wit' ya bitch, ain't no question that's me
Fuck you talking bout, all them niggas suggest me
Light a joint and let that smoke where your chest be, nigga

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, turn them dreams into paper, yeah
Flyer than delta, I can help ya
Get your weight up, ho's reaching for the wings, we dont save 'em no
