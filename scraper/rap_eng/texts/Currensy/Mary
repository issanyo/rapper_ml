[Verse]
First thing when I wake up
I say my prayers then I blaze up
A plate of breakfast that my girl chef'd up
Morning pretty with no makeup, yup
Now that I'm woken, I'm smoking, layered my body in clothing
Chevrolet doors open, Forgiatos rolling
On the interstate like niggas was shooting at your homie
Zooming in and out of lanes, booming a lil UGK
Got both my phones with me, hit me if it's 'bout some cake
Soldier about-face, I'm colder than ice age
I'm polar, I'm frozen, I'm golden, my name say
That I'm all about my money, put some racks up every day
In the studio get Pluto high, we lay tracks every day
Mucho loot though, if you grind for it, mane
Get some shine for ya mane
But that money just ain't gonna wait around for ya, mane
Tell your bitch to roll up something if she ride for ya, mane
Otherwise you gotta kick that ho off side of ya, mane
Tell them niggas that you with ain't no more crying 'bout it, mane
Planning, never taking action, pocket full of lint
Wondering why this shit ain't happen, homie that don't make no sense
Niggas on this side be stacking, every tape a brick
And we treat this shit just like it's trapping
And I'm getting rich, you can tell from the strength
Of the scent, of what I just lit but I would never pass it
First thing when I wake up
I say my prayers, then I blaze up
Get dressed sharp as a razor
And then it's back to getting cake, bruh

[Outro]
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary
Oh, Mary, Mary, Mary
