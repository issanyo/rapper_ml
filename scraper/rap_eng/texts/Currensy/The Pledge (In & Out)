Ride Chevy Wide-body across the Bridge of Terabithia
Skills I was born with but I can try teachin ya
Drop gems from the clouds homie hope they reachin ya
The one they turnin up their speakers for
It's undeniable that I'm liable to own the world as I'm entitled fool
Get it right all I need is a try or two
If I was you id only do what I wanted to do
And tell them other niggas kick rocks, yeah
Park my jet at the end of the block
G-Shock, matching my argyle socks
This year when the ball drop in my heart I knew
This was no time to let suckas knock me out for my loot
Take me out from my root
I'd be a damn fool, I Mapquested it
It's right at my next exit, shit
Catch my bread I'm right back in this shit
Protect my neck homie only in myself do I invest
Only in your hands does your fate really rest
But you could leave it to another man be my guest
Could never survive in my shoes homie not a step
Cause I move with those of whom you are scared to death
Sucka ass niggas ain't rappin that real
Ya'll should be members of the Screen Actors Guild
Bitches see their reflections when they look in my wheel
But they never get to do it cause I can't keep still
Pedal to the metal smell the rubber when I peel
Before I get on the beat the beat write it's own will
Trees in the grinder, the bottles on chill
Hand on your bitch hand, my mind on another meal, yeah. (Jets Fool)
