[Verse 1]
Spitta get this whole shit jumping like
Kangaroo pouch, Louis Vuitton
The small things make me different from these fools
Pull my drawstrings, keep my sweats off of my shoes
I'm a dog, man, keep my paws clean
I ain't fucking with you at all
Lames is your whole set, Gs don't recognize y'all
Independent acrobatics, make that loot somersault
Remembering my license and restrictions in my mom's car
Came a long way, but I don't got time to be
Sitting at the dock of the bay, wasting every second
Money can be made out a rhyme, I can do it on the dime
Kick the shit out the beat until it die, call CSI
I got 'em running, scared, tryna catch up
Fifty-seven Heinz, Gregory the dance legend
Make music, I'm stepping out at a major event
Best-dressed in attendance and I never left the house

[Hook]
Right back at it
Light the pilot, get the pot
We can get it cracking in here
Audio dope, we track trafficking
And they asking for more, is you back again?
And I ain't talking 'bout practice no more
When it's game time, show me to the stove
Audio dope
Yeah, nigga, we track trafficking
They asking for more, is you back again?

[Verse 2]
Greens rolled under the gazebo
Lemonade-level vodka
Backgammon, playing Keno
Musical mafia
Loaded bases, bring my team home, I'm the great Bambino
Roulette wheels in the casino
Fat Macs skimming off the top
But that's the game we in
What you gon' do about it, huh?
Sacrifice and hit the independent? Probably not
They not like me, that's why they don't like me
Me, I'm likely in my trailer in-between scenes
Got the feature girl from the video full of weed
Break your foot tryna kick how I kick it
Kill yourself tryna live how I'm living
Spitta

[Hook]

[Outro]
(All around the world, the same song
Cali bud strong, it's that love Faizon
So high, 'til my neighbors thought I moved out
Because your boy stay gone
Now tell me that I ain't got it, and then keep a straight face, punk)
