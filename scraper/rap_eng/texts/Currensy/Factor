[Verse 1]
Yeah
Get up in the morning, slip kicks on
Hop up in the whip and drop last nights bitch off
Hot spitta, nigga I return it like a kick-off
Right back to you fool, I never stick with broads
Beep the horn two times, then dip off
I'm heading by Melissa's
Said she got the hook up on some Wal-Mart gift cards
Another day in the life of Spitta, happy to share it with ya
My life is an unequaled experience to the listner
Society of flyness, only a few may enter
You are not a member, if you were I would remember
When I met you, I am not impressed so son you got me twisted
Two strikes, already swung for some bum pitches
Next time I'mma send it for the fences
Music on mute, I'm just riding to my engine
Got my business on my mind, mind on my business (and autmobiles)

[Hook]
No tint when I ride, I wan' be seen bitch
And I ain't got nothing to hide, my interior clean
You know I'm a factor (x4)
If you in the club, and you looking for me
I'm with the players blowing weed
Right in front of the security
They know I'm a factor
They know we a factor
We know we a factor (x2)

[Verse 2]
Club night, xenon headlights
Z06 'vette, I'm getting bread right?
Shorty on the monthly, I call it the red light
But I just be like, "I can still get some head right?"
I cop two V.I.P sections
Rearrange the velvet rope, put them bitches together
Got a swag and a flow, I'm so together
Got your girl and you swore ya'll were so together
Wear what I want, fuck what you say go together
No stylist can ever take credit for dressin'
Curren$y the Hot Spitta niggas spittin' Wessons
Stay high so the game don't have me stressin'
My city show me love when I roll through sections
I feed off that, and I keep on reppin'
That's the energy I need for me to keep on steppin'
Till I get to the top, cause that's where I'm headin'

[Hook]
