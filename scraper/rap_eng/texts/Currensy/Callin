[Intro]
La-La-la-la
Me and Rich in here at 2 o'clock in the morning
More Saturday Night Tunes
You ironing your motherfuckin' leather sweat pants for the club

[Verse 1]
Outside like Tommy Buns
Four in the morning
I'm about to blow the horn
Hurry ya ass up homeboy - it's on
Can't get passed up
Are you cashed up enough to weather the storm?
That shit coming I know
That shit coming for sure
Some look it right in the eye
Some niggas run for the door
I'm prepaired so I'ma stay right here
Front porch OG rocking chair
Putting that fucking doja in the air
Those cannot compare
Your flow's not rare
Run of the mill
You can find that anywhere
But this shit right here
Get in your ears quickly
Fiending you out
You'll be customer of the year now
Bitches want to date
Cause her man always hate
Saying my name everyday
Now she wanna know how it taste
I'm in here rapping making up these tapes
Like I be wrapping up the weight
Razor blade scrape lines
Clean the whole plate
Ma' say your grace

[Hook]

Calling them hoes bitches
And smoking my weed up
Ten toes down I'ma stay g'd up
Calling them hoes bitches
And smoking my weed up

Throw the set
Whenever you see us
Calling them hoes bitches
And smoking my weed up
Ten toes down I'ma stay g'd up
Calling them hoes bitches
And smoking my weed up

[Verse 2]
Miami Vice on mute
Weed lit, killer beats on loop
Repeat this until I step into the booth
Laying something new
And then I'm in that old school
When the session through
From the grower, directly to you
I got so many styles it be hard to choose
Rather to just lay 'em
Or just save 'em for later
Cause niggas be waiting
For a chance to steal your sound
And then pretend to be the originator
Fake it till they make it
Bogus jewelry - fool, you just gold plated
My Chevy heavy, so is my bracelet
Not complacent, rather impatient
Can't be waiting on that paper
I'ma have to chase it
Though it's mad evasive
Spin move, juke and shaking
Choosing to get in this hustle
Could make you or break you
Or just make you crazy
Or make you major
And take you places
It's all on how you play it
Just how any game is

[Hook x2]
