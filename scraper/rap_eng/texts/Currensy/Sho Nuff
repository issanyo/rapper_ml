[Verse 1]
Gold [?] and some lean, bitch been on them things
Carried ourselves like the queen who could support a king
Or very well run the castle by her damn self
A little more then you'll be perfect, let these hands help
That stashed wealth got me moving with a sense of sureness
Women all over this like a swordfish swimming in this gorgeous mist
In the middle of November, 5 in the morning
Park in the lot at the Staples Center, hitting the plane flight
She dome me out while I was on the phone
Wrapping up some business, booking a flight
The type you put on your wish list
Them bitches you scared to get with cause you know she come up with hustler's pockets deeper than your shit
Broke nigga like me, she been waiting for a while
I got paper, she just tryna make me more
We in Soho at the [?], I'm like lace me ho
Everything I wanted to eat and snatched me a couple of hundreds for my homies
That's how we do, I catch a bus, I put my dogs on it
We ride until the wheels fall off it, till the wheels break
Give us some roller skates, go get it babe
I'm perfecting my fadeaway, pulling of in that Porsche as I light the J
If it's 'bout games man please not today
I got a lot to do, can't bullshit with you, that ain't gone get me paid
We tryna eat and wrap up take home plates
Leave the fucking streets smoking like an ashtray
