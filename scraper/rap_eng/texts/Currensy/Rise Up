(Intro)
Yeah
Curren$y Tha Hot Spitta
Young Money nigga
Cash Money nigga
Fly Society
Tell them pussy ass niggas don't bother me
Fly Society, tell them pussy ass niggas don't....

Hot Spitta nigga fuck ho's make cheese
Down with a camp called YME
Now if you wanna join the team you know must see me
But I don't trust too many niggas, ain't they all police?
So get them all away from me, cause all they do is hate on me
Wanna lock me up. throw the key away and shut the gate on me
Asalaam alaikum to my neighbors from the Nation
I'm a Christian but I dig some of the things that they be sayin'
About the state of the black man, how we need to rise up
Shoot for the stars, boy you need to raise your eyes up
Wise up homie cause the government don't give a fuck
Why we get shot in the hood, they out hunting ducks
Watching baseball games, goin' ice fishin'
While you slingin' hard pieces tryin' to have a nice christmas
And they the ones who brought it to the hood, they started it
They just mad you gettin' rich off it

(Outro)
