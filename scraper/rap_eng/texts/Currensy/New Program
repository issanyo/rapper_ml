[Intro]
Time's like these people wanna get high
Real high and real fast
And this is gonna do it
And make us rich

[Verse 1: Young Roddy]
Until I make that double X.L., them critics tell me I ain't nice
Said I ain't doing it right until I cop myself some ice
But I'm a blood diamond, either way I shine bright
I break bread with my fam, even if it was a slice
But I'm working on my loaf, being broke ain't no joke
Before this rap shit I used to hit the flyest hoes
Way before this rap shit my gear game been Polo
And they tell my I ain't shit until I'm sitting on twenty-fours
Ain't that cold, getting whipped over with a trunk full of O's
He on his last leg, three strikes plus parole
That's just another story 'bout a kid who tryna' blow
No Bruce Leroy but bet this ghetto boy glow
And I'm the people's choice, bet I make 'em pass the torch
The ball in my court, free my niggas who got caught
I'm riding on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
You know, us against the world, me and my girl, and I'm out
