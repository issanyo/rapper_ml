[Verse]
Aw naw, here your man go
With his same old songs 'bout Chevys and getting stoned
Meeting bitches in clubs and bringing them home
Cutting to the chase, don't even turn my flatscreen on
All around the world the same song
Cali bud strong, it's that love Faizon
So high, that my neighbors thought I moved out
Because your boy stay gone
Now tell me that I ain't got it and then keep a straight face, punk
Create that Elevator Musik and stay true to it
While you still trying to get your soul out the pawn shop, stupid
You lost your legs to that cookie cutter
The suits ain't letting you walk outta that deal, muhfucka
Potato chips, laid up, Frito, raise up
Got a couple bitches coming through to blaze up
They know where I'm at, they know what I do, they know I'm real rap
And I'm completely un-you, hold on, fool
And everything bad for a nigga nowadays so I drink a lot of water
Disgruntled rapper disorder, got a lot of MCs sneak dissing
Yeah, would've threw them slangs but I caught 'em
Be careful talking hella trash
I'll get that compacted to a handful and pitch it back at you
Take that monkey shit off, you embarrassing us, cuz
Put the game back in perspective
Niggas disrespecting it, suckas ain't protecting it
Just complaining about the state
And under the pressure they break
Turning into the very thing that they hate
Roll up, let it burn slow
Getting high, plotting on downing these turncoats

[Hook x2]
Audio dope, and we can make crack like this
Practice, we talking 'bout practice?
For what? I can do it in my sleep
Homeboy, I ain't been out my bed since '93

Audio dope, and we can make crack like this
