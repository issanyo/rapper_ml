[Chorus]
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Outta ten hoes, nigga bet you I could mac one
Window down, top drop

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
In and out of lanes dripping drops of paint
Cheeseballs, Dana Dane's, smoking my own strain
Some of the trillest in the game who still remain
Mentally independent the last lyricist the original track flippers
The booth was in the bathroom, front room where the homies engineered
Your friends couldn't talk until your rap was through
What you know about, going in for the win, going all the way out
I done unlocked the fence, and I let the dogs out
Some squares tucking they broads now, don't want to lose your world
After investing so much, but they belong to the game don't none of 'em belong to us
I had a couple rolled up when I rolled up
Rolex out the window of a super sport Nova
I did a burnout it look like the tires exploded
I'm holding, but that's like everyday if you know me

[Chorus]
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Outta ten hoes, nigga bet you I could mac one
Window down, top drop
Window down, top drop

[Verse 2: Scotty ATL]
Window down, top drop
Nigga gon' get my guap
In and out of traffic like a nigga playing hopscotch
Tryna make the block rock, tryna find the soft spot
In my heart too much pain, crying on my guap like
Tears of joy, damn I'm proud of myself
Came out the motherfucking mud, that's my cellphone
Checks,Â Cool Club, lames get no love
What you saying lil homie?
I kiss my cross for my dead lil homie
Saw a shooting star yesterday, felt God was speaking
Walk in the bank with that bag, the reefer wreaking
Had to let my nuts hang a little, new territory
Was scared for me, momma I made it
Went from spam in the can, to sea bass on plates
30 minutes in the dealership, new paper plates
My windows down, my wheels rolling like skates
ATL, New Orleans, straight drop, we pushing Wraiths

[Chorus]
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Window down, top drop chiefin' on a fat one
Outta ten hoes, nigga bet you I could mac one
Window down, top drop
Window down, top drop
