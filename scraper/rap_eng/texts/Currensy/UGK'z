[Intro: Bun B]
People always ask me, Bun Beeda
'What does it mean to be a Underground King ?'
That's a good question
Being a Underground King means that you keep it 100, even when people ain't looking
Especially when the cameras ain't off, cause it's easy to play that role when everybody is watching
Being a Underground King means that you ready to take a stand for people that can't stand for themselves
For your hood, your friends, your family or even somebody that you don't even know
Being a Underground King means that you won't comprise yourself
For money, for fame, for power, for flesh
No matter what it offers to you, no matter what people try to give you, you don't let these thing define you
Only you can define yourself, only you can make you a Underground King

[Verse 1: Le$]
Jumped in my Cad', sitting on swangers
Gettin' to it fast, young hustler living dangerous
Born in that swamp, should I say New Orleans
H-Town to N-O, rolling then we chase green
Now let me set some shit straight, cause I think they confused
I done gave too much game, no more blessing these fools
Don't appreciate it when you tryna give 'em the trill
Gotta go and get it, homie only eat what I kill
Tryna stack a lil something and just stay out the way
Seen a young nigga stressing 'til his hair turned grey
Life quick to beat yo ass  if you been livin' wrong
It done happened to more of 'em I can name in a song
In that white Monte Carlo, had the Dayton's and pipes
You couldn't tell me that my shit ain't tight
I been doing it right
Ass bottom, but they tell you what it is
Fucking with the set, no limit to this shit

[Hook: Le$]
I just wanna be a king of the underground
Just wanna be a king of the underground
Put it down, 'til we kings of the underground
Where the crown, we the kings of the underground
I just wanna be a king of the underground

[Verse 2: Le$]
Created a lane, never played by the rules
Suckers ask me for game, wanna study your moves
I don't know you nigga, dawg we just went to school
So quit lying to bitches, saying that we was cool
Guilty by association so I'm surrounded by G's
I used to ride with my cousin banging 400 Degreez
Now niggas bumping my music that shit is hard to believe
And I been feeling like lately no one go harder than me
Hustle smarter than me for the steak and the shrimp
I'm just providing the sound for all the players and pimps
Them boppers calling my phone but ain't no time to be stopping
I just be focused on work, I know they gonna keep watching
I made my momma some promises that I still gotta keep
A couple cars in the house that shit don't really come cheap
Want â€˜em refurbished, sum plastics take the doors off the jeep
Since I first had me that dream I never went back to sleep

[Hook: Le$]
I just wanna be a king of the underground
Just wanna be a king of the underground
Put it down, 'til we kings of the underground
Where the crown, we the kings of the underground
I just wanna be a king of the underground

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Royalty regard me ass
First class, my boy [?]
Pilot Talk, OG Kush, my status
For show gas
Met your girl that hoe chose fast
I roll past with see through glass
On my way to the studio to spit true facts
Long as I can add
Understand rap math-matics
Automatically they work down and I get that cash
Trill niggas come first, only ones gone last
When the shit turning dirt, underground where it's at
And we was here the whole time
Thank you done something you out your motherfucking mind
Underground hustle with that mainstream shine
Them arm niggas rolexes not as icy as mine
Drug money, niggas slanging these rhymes
Drug money, stack paper all the time

[Hook: Le$]
I just wanna be a king of the underground
Just wanna be a king of the underground
Put it down, 'til we kings of the underground
Where the crown, we the kings of the underground
I just wanna be a king of the underground
