[Verse: Curren$y]
They gonna need drone footage to really get to it
These coupes is movin'
Through busy traffic they maneuverin', like it ain't nothin' to em
As a youngin, I was inducted into a serious unit
The training was grueling
Mafia grooming, schooled on how to be the Don
So when I got on one day, I'd be used to it and know what I'm doin'
Cause the stakes is high and nowadays you get killed from lookin' stupid
From like all the other way, shooters in bushes with rifles like pool sticks
Infrared goggles and all kind of Call of Duty shit
They tryna take you off of here
And I'm online ordering an office chairs
Get high all the time off the California finest
No I don't own Balenciagas, but all of my weed designer
Every night lemonade, cold vodka and sprite
I get what I like
Blow 100 on ice and make it all back tonight
This is the life

[Hook: Curren$y]
They gonna need drone footage to really get to it
They gonna need drone footage to really get to it
They gonna need drone footage to really get to it
They gonna need drone footage to really get to it
