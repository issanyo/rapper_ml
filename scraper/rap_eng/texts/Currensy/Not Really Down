[Chorus]
We pull up in foreign cars smellin' like a pound
Your bitch made decisions to be with us right now
Catchin' feelings over bitches, homie you should calm down
Live with the fact, my nigga, you not really down
Nah, you not really down
Square-ass niggas need never come around
Nah, my nigga you not really down, no

[Verse 1]
Take a bong snap dive in a shark tank
Do a couple laps run through these recreational stacks
[?] I call up me and my niggas, we ballin'
Catchin' stunts like alley-oops dunkin' on 'em
Always one up on 'em
Slide into them Black Toe Jordan 1s this mornin'
Protect yo' neck 'fore I fuckin' stand on it
Mash like that gas pedal, baby girl almost lost her Chanel sash
And the Ferrari flash, back at the pad like Batman
Makin' plans to choke up all these Jokers, Louis Vuitton loafers
Mulsanne with the chauffeur, only top premium smoker
Brought a pound just for openers, just for me and all the dopest ones
You couldn't even be an opener at the shows that I be throwin', bruh

[Chorus]
We pull up in foreign cars, smellin' like a pound
Your bitch made decisions to be with us right now
Catchin' feelings over bitches, homie you should calm down
Live with the fact, my nigga, you not really down
Nah, you not really down
Square-ass niggas need never come around
Nah, my nigga you not really down, no
