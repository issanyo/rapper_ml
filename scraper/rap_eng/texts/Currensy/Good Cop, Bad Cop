[Chorus]
What you gon' do if they come for you?
Pullin' guns out for a traffic stop
Good cop, bad cop
What you gon' do if they come for you?
Pattin' us down
Blue lights turn the lights out
Bad cop

[Verse 1]
'Bout an hour up the road from my New Orleans blocks
But all around the world they heard them shots
Said he was trying to pull somethin out
But no man deserved what he got
I've seen folks fight police and get away with more
What was the use of that deadly force based on?
Was it because he weighed more?
Was it the pressure from your job?
You wish you was gettin' paid more?
I wish life was like a dry erase board...
We could erase, and draw pictures of happier days before
But it's another bro we gotta dig a grave for
People block the interstate tryn'a devote a race war
Stoppin' traffic, cause a reaction
Street G's want a dialogue with the police captain
I'm just rollin' tryn'a stay focused
Hopin' they don't pull us over and smoke us
I heard it's cold in Minnesota

[Chorus]
What you gon' do if they come for you?
Pullin' guns out for a traffic stop
What you gon' do if they come for you?
Red 'n blue might turn your lights out
Good cop, bad cop

[Verse 2]
And see, I know a few cool police
I can't knock 'em
Errbody need a job bruh
But I'm watchful cause
Some of them muhfuckers not your partners bruh
They pull you over and approach you hella hostile bruh
Speaking on it prob'ly gimme hella problems but
Spitta don't trip because God got him
See this one time I was slidin' through Baton Rouge
Cop pulled us over
They wadn't lovin' my weed fumes
Put us in the grass
Handcuffs, two by two
And then they offered bullet holes to me and my crew
Towed the truck away
We walked to the stage
We had a good time anyway and got paid
We was lucky that night, but who's to say
I ain't gon' talk that way
Makes my Momma nervous
She be worryin'
From hearin' all them horror stories

[Chorus] X2
What you gon' do when they come for you?
Pullin' guns out for a traffic stop
Good cop, bad cop
What you gon' do if they come for you?
Red and blues might turn your lights out
Good cop, bad cop
