[Verse 1 - Young Roddy]
Guess who's bizack, bitch
You can smell the blow in my clothes - I relapse, bitch
This one for my homies who been trappin' in that trap, bitch
Who tryin' to go get it, push that pedal to the mat, bitch
But if it's 'bout some business tell 'em hit me on my jack
I'm self-made man I never had to piggyback
Like Paul Pierce, I'm the truth, no lyin' in these raps
Use Good Sense bags to bag this audio crack
Real nigga, with my brother I spit my last
True stoner, every moment, smokin' on that gas
Success all in my pathway, I got them haters mad
I'm only catchin' flights, they catchin' feelings mad fast
So bitch ass niggas probably talk behind my back
Gold diggin' bitches tryin' to get keys to my pad
Sorry, never that, nice try, but never that, ho
Tryin' not to make a sound, creepin' out that back, doe, piss po'
But I got my eye on a milli
Twistin' up that killer got my fingertips sticky
I thought this chick was with me, tryin' to stick my for my chippies
Always had a feelin' she was tryin' to catch my slippin'
I guess she on her grizzly too

[Hook x2]
Fat ass, pretty face, shorty, she a killer
Fat ass, pretty face, shorty, she a killer
Damn, I guess she on her grizzly too

[Verse 2 - Curren$y]
One for the money, two for the bitches
Can't knock the hustle, cause mama on her grizzly
If them niggas fall for it, then she pick up them Benjis
Niggas'll support her, escort her through them corridors
It ain't nothin' but Gs, feel the aura, ho
To a captain save-a, my set is a horror show
Hold tight behavior, corrected, whenever the real step in
Swear she got that pimp scent off me
That the smell of that money and that killer in the car with me
Bitches callin' me daddy, got me feelin' quite fatherly
A boss in these streets
Checkin' my financial gains quarterly
Profit margins increase largely
Smart ass bitches is on me
Aware of my growth, my net, my gain but I reverse that
I'm at your throat bitch, this game
Oh, you on your grind? I'm double time on mine
Check that

[Hook x2]
