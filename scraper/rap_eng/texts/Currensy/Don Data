[Ox]
Hey yo
The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want
He maketh Ox and Curren$y lie down in green pastures
Yea though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
We fear no evil
[?] Ox and Curren$y AK-47, a fucking desert eagle
[?] [?]
I am the original [?] don dada, you heard?

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
That was the homie Ox, you niggas know him from Belly
The nigga’s really that nigga, for real, for real

Wake up in the morning and I get myself together
Make sure I’m fly before I step out in that weather
Because them jive-ass niggas trying to ruffle my feathers
Because I’m 760 beamer wide, 747 fly
Up in the crib watching Vanilla Sky
Vanilla cigarillos, I’m very high
I got an incense burner smelling like cherry pie
Bitches is finally learning that I am the guy
1-9-6-4 I-M-P-A-L-A in L.A
Right in the middle of the city where Terry stay
Felli Fel showed me how to work the interstate
N.O. loco on the license plate
And then it’s back to the N.O
07 Carerra I copped from Jay Leno
Fuck that girl and leave her boyfriend a memo
Spitta, nigga, wake up and smell the roses
Young Money, Curren$y, the flow is awesome
Widebody Benz, but the rims is Carlsson
Could have chose Borbets, but forget about it
That heater, I got it under my seat tucked
That’s just in case a nigga wanna stir some ground chuck
I’d rather not let the four pound bust
I’ll put some money on your head and have you scared to drive your truck
These niggas playing all kind of games in my city
So every time I move I gotta bring my rounds with me
Niggas try to hit me, but I’m like AIDS test results
Got them boys scared to come and get me
Spitta
