Pull up in that new shit
Park my coupe at Ruth's Chris
Get a plate to go and hit the door and keep it moving
No tint on my windows
Let them bitches see straight through them
See me inside it
I know exactly what im doing
Mama I dont hide it
I just show it to them
That attracts them to me
Then I dont have to go to them
White and yellow diadoras feathers
In my Stussy fedora
Hawaiian shirt print floral
Ferrari twin turbos
Or Lamborghini toros
Stuntin on you niggas
When im in it take your homo
Dont want a shot of cuervo
But we could burn some purple at the crib
I got the arcade version of ninja turtles
