Yea.. Yea.. On Everything
Its just I know that bitch so cool..
These are fast times at Ridgemont Fly
These are fast times at Ridgemont Fly
These are fast times at Ridgemont Fly

In n Out

Rise and shine
Penthouse suite surrounded by dimes
All of em asleep, recoverin
From a wild night with my brother n them
Car blocked in, fuck it take my brother's benz
Thinkin bout scoopin up Chick-fil-A
'Till I remember they closed on Sunday
Ride up a one way
Same block where niggas hand off rocks like coach called the wrong play
Even Brett Favre rockin' with the Jets
Spitta in the mix like chex
Chex Mix in the bowl in the green room of the Conan O'Brien show
They say I'm up next
Ask Marc Ecko if my flow complex
Bitches I mold them like Play-Doh
Travel the globe like a crook ducking Carmen Sandiego
Crooks & Castles watch and frames, my crew neck by Play Cloths
See lames I push up on they hoes
Like "Mama what u doin with them amateurs?
You should be messing with a player of my caliber."
The difference between Ros√© and Franzia
Month after month I always come back for ya
Look me in the eyes know what's looking back at ya..
Your opportunity to be a passenger
On a jet that's destined to land up top
You can roll, if not eat dirt while we laugh at ya

In n Out

Jets Nigga
