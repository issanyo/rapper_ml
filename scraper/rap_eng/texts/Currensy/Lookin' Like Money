[Hook]
Got like 5 to 6 cold bottles
Couple jars of five

[Verse 1 - Curren$y]
She don't fuck with broke niggas
You know I ain't no broke nigga
I won't call her a gold digger
To me she like a go getter
Wanted a real nigga and she spotted one
Slid onside[?] of 'em
Did what was required of her to ride with 'em
The choice was made, her decision was to get this vision
See it's almost like I'm pimpin'
I helped develop her into something that's worth livin' with
We could make a million bitch, if you're listenin' to this
Take instruction, trust, there'll be rewards in abundance
And I ain't get this far by knowin' nothin'
Money made money, saved money, blown money
Go on bitch, we had fun, either way
You only live once, not promised another day
And never be scared to jump
This is for the life who's pushin' their way up front

[Chorus - Repeat x1]
Lookin' like it, smellin' like it
Money talk - I'm all about it
Deposits - they get me excited
Bitch you need to see about it

[Verse 2 - Tiny C Style]
Tiny fool[?] smellin' like a million, givin' mixed feelin's
I know what you like - good guy with a dapper[?] feelin'
Gangster who's sophisticated thug and a gentlemen
About them benjemins, only make moves for them dividends
Money all the time, tunnel vision on my grind
All I see is dollar signs, at the bank is where you find
Blue-faced style[?], bitch I'm in the joint, probably should see about it
Ain't about paper, you could leave me out it
Hood-tastic[?] block of pool, fuck the ones who doubt it
Gettin' to it while you snooze cause I can't live without it
Money, power, respect, trynna fuck up some commas
Closed mouth, ears open, you might learn somethin'
Fuck around and earn some, my life was burdensome[?]
They bagged[?] these industries
Jet life got this game covered like bed sheets
Sleeping on a g, you gon' wake up workin' for me
Work hard, live well, period, end of story, nigga
