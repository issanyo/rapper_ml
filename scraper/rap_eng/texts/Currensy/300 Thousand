[Intro]
Don't listen to this and wreck yo' shit though
I got a feeling this gon' have Rolls Royce drivers going crazy
Drive safe though, drive safe though
Eastside I love ya, lets do it

[Chorus]
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
Three pieces underneath helicopter propellers

[Verse 1]
Cops tend not pull us over unless they extra jealous
Most the time pay me no mind know I'm a cool fella
Know I stand for something push youngins to do better
Don't ever ask for nothing get out and put in the effort
The school of hard knocks taught ya boy some valuable lessons
Put some money up and thank God for all your blessings
Know when you think it's only you somewhere somebody else is
Dealing with more pressure, they started out with lesser than you have
And y'all both is on the race for the cash
You best got on a faster path, take me for example
Got up off my ass went from coach boarding pass to first class
Dream cars in storage, more classics and foreigns at the pad
My cars look like the doors broke, cause I'm not broke
That's not no joke
My cars look like the doors broke, because I'm not broke
That's not no joke

[Chorus]
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
Three pieces underneath helicopter propellers

[Verse 2]
Every feature in this car, there ain't shit you could sell me
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
Cops tend not to pull me over unless they extra jealous
They know I'm a cool fella
Stand for something push them youngins to do better
300 thousand and it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
Became millionaires despite what the teachers would tell us
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
Before I crack the door, I'm sure that you could smell me
Andretti OG tree is mighty healthy
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
300 thousand dollars it came with two umbrellas
