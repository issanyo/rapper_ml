[Hook]
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
Smoke something in my ride

[Verse]
In the Bape coat, in a grey ghost
To the condo so we can change clothes
She has a 6 Series Beemer four door
Say she "set goals" and I was one of those
Suppose, I should be glad she chose
Over these girls, man you never know
Hide up, still on my toes
Also don't come with that fuck shit
Shooters and merry go 'round with this ho, gotta let know who run shit
Get 'em up off that dumb shit
I'm on some stacking my funds shit
I'm tryna see all my dawgs rich
(I'm tryna see all my dawgs rich)
I'ma follow me to where the cars is
I'm finna show you who the boss is

[Hook]
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside

[Verse 2]
Nigga spark one in my Chevy, if you really ready
This Andretti game selling, my chain heavy
Self made, me and my rollie just took a selfie
Broke niggas on mute, it ain't shit they can tell me
Through the joint you smelling it, baby my roll is consecutive
Too high too see my competitors
Too high too keep up with my schedule
But I stay on my commas and decimals, at all time
Don't sleep, girl I'm never that high
Roll another one underneath the street lights
Light that bitch off for the whole eastside
She can't hide it, I see it in her eyes
She tryna come see what a G like

[Hook]
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
I'd be obliged if you stepped outside
Smoke something in my ride
