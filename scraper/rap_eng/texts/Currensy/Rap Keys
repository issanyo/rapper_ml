[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah
Wasting no time
2017
Weed and Instrumentals 3
Everybody on the grind
Jet Life
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Adidas track pants, pockets stuffed like fifty grand
Diamond wrist band, perpetual second hands
Highed up never land, took a stand
Me and the fam never ever going broke again
Pac hits to champagne
Blue ounces of smoke to the wind
We the underground champions that be down toast your man
Lift them glasses
Designated driver bring my party goers home in S classes
That's classic
Andretti, them buys classic Jet Life family
Don't become a casualty fucking with the faculty
Rap hustlers getting endorsements like athletes
Rapidly stacking like Jenga
Street repeats bangers
Always sharp and on point like a triangle
I'm always brah, you can't play us
Made ones become major
Yeah

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
And lately I been killing so much shit my face just might be up in the paper
Young nigga kicking hella flavour
Can't run game on me
Think up on your moves before you make 'em
In that Monte seat like I'm racing
Putting in that work letting them know what I'm worth
Stayed down not a youngun coming out head first
I'm a boss so I go in every time I work
Lil boy don't you cross the line, know you're getting murked
I practice what I preach that's why my life at ease
Everyday a week got another goal to reach
Give your bitch the dick then [?]
Fucking up the game but really I'm trying to eat
Jet Life nigga get your motherfucking mind right
Coming through in whips that'll make you run a stop sign
I don't know about you but I'm going after mine
And free the BG but until then Imma shine

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys

[Verse 3: Fendi P]
P
I
Grind for more paper
Count it up later
Go through the wax by the layers
Sipping on that Mo' in my drug dealer coat
Hella dope extend my pinky when I toast like a player
Balling on them niggas, still coach you like a player
Still walk light in the icy white pair
Still pray to God but we still live in hell
Peep the irony, I'm fresh to death walking over shells
Please ask the shells keep my pockets on that
And my stash for the yeah know my gun up in there
I just pulled in the front, is there hoes up in there
Turn the loft to a trap, let them hoes cook up there
No dinner nigga
Fucking up the budget no rental
Remember, hustling so long can't remember
Fuck it I might build a shed for the winter
So much wood catch a splinter
Nigga

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys
Trying to find a way to come up on a few G's
Trying to find a way to push a couple rap keys
