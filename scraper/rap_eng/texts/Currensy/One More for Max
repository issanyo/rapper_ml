[Pre-Verse]
You know we was going to hold Max down at all times right?
Don't sleep

[Verse 1: ]
They still got Max locked though
I keep the Wave flame thorough the speakers in my drop
Cut my sweatpants into shorts
My fresh Polo socks gleaming bright white
Against my corduroy house shoes
Sitting in the crib watching the news

Live for it, die for it, all we know is
Steady growing, raking dough in
Preparing, encase the vultures coming for it

Never looking back
