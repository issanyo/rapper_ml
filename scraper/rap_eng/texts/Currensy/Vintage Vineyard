[Produced by Thelonious Martin]

[Verse 1]
Open fireplaces
Me and my lady back home from a wine tasting
The scene was crazy, millionaires of all shades and trades exchanging jokes
Helicopters chopping as we smoke
Plotting on a way to get this cash cow roped up and tied down
Snipers outside my compound
Inside we pow-wow, been doing this for some time now
Andretti most slept on like yo big homie's couch
I'm from New Orleans, you'll get crept on and Xd out
And we like, damn, we was just talking to homie
Stretched, EMS threw them covers on him
But them children already seen it
Three in the morning, woke his whole family up with that screaming
Visions of hits, niggas dying, living in shit
I'm just writing 'bout it, lighting my exotic
Call it like eight-ball corner pocket, drop it

[Interlude: The Godfather]
Don Corleone: My wife is crying upstairs. I hear cars coming to the house
Tom Hagen: I was just about to come up and wake you so that I could tell you
Don Corleone: But you needed a drink first. And now you've had your drink
Tom Hagen: They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead

[Verse 2]
Real niggas have died over a bitch's lies
I know my brother would ride if ever, but never
The corporation grow forever even when I'm gone
Play my shit and light yo bong
Life goes on
We family, I'm there for you, right or wrong
They gon' have to get us all the same way, dog
'Til then, sunroof top, the doja in the wind
Mami, it don't stop, you know you tryna get in
Dipping up the block with a G like him
These is rare events
To live another way doesn't make sense

[Outro: The Godfather]
Don Corleone: I want no inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance. I want you to arrange a meeting with the heads of the Five Families. This war stops now
