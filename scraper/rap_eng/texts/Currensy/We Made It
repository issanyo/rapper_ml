[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Spitta nigga any beat I get on I get off into my zone
Think we gotta 7 grams left of that zone
'bout to call my girl and tell her bring another one from home
I get it on like the power button on the television remote
So hold roll with us or you choke on that jet smoke
Niggas know the jet smoke, the best from both coasts
I got plugs like an extension cord cause
Spitta bring it back like you fucked up my
Order at the drive through can a nigga really rap
Homie, are the Devils from Duke, Blue?
Ride off the block bitches try to jump in the sunroof (it's so true)
And I ain't got no feathers in my seat but that's your chick in my coupe

Nothin' but a G thing baby, two East side niggas going crazy
FS is the set we made it
Laughing at them bitch niggas they hatin'

[Verse 2: Trademark Da Skydiver]
Trademark the force with me I'm dead eye
My flow priceless you can't cop it at Best Buy
And to the tech sign, ts just a test drive
Like a broke nigga trying to cop an X5
They waiting on me to drop, like the next live
I'm just smoking trine thinking of my next line
I'm so focused like professor x man
Kicks fire, wrist ice plus my neck shine
Yes I'm that fly, multiply 10 times
Divided by my swag and this is what you have
Foreign whips, chicks and a lotta cash
Big money sacks they looking like lotto bags
I'm blowing that fire weed we call it the hydro hash
Sports car trunk in the front two on the dash
I take off from run wheels and hella pass
Boat launch triggered ghost out like ??

Nothin' but a G thing baby, two East side niggas going crazy
FS is the set we made it
Laughing at them bitch niggas they hatin'
