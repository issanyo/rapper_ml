[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Never in a million years....
Did I figure I would make it here
But I did and from this position I see clear
That I got so much farther to go
Before I even get close to the goal
Got a lot but still I want mo'
Just show me where the loot at, nigga, watch them Jets go
A dollar and a dream to shut them corvette doors
Behind automatic gates in my lake view estate
Because I opened up a can of whoop-ass on those who said I can't
I think about 'em every time I walk into the bank
Notice that I said "Walk-in"
Bossin'
Big transactions through that small shit in the drive-thru, Lil' Daddy
Go on, look at 'em. See how he did it?
The road split
I made the right decision quickly
You stuck in the middle bull-shittin'
Time steady slippin'
Enter the future with the time given
"What did you do, Sir?" Ask yourself while I'm chillin'
Chevrolet, chrome grillin' these hoes - patty melt
Playing Curtis Mayfield; I'm pretty sure this how my daddy felt
My sons out here trippin', baby girl go fetch my belt. (Whip it)
(Skrrrr)

[Hook x2]
A dollar and a dream to shut corvette doors
A dollar and a dream to shut corvette doors
A house to park it at and then on to the sto'
A main bitch, a mistress, a couple of hoes
Folding my clothes, weed already rolled
A dollar and a dream to shut corvette doors
