[Intro]
Add a little bit of that sauce on there. Having high speed chases with the coast guard
Throwing parties at the boat launch, having high-speed chases with the coast guard

[Verse 1]
Buying super fast cars, though we drive ‘em slow
Swinging through the neighborhood, they ain’t seen this one before
Oh there he go!
Hustle hard is all he know
Homie got plenty to show
Andretti wear that Presi, though he drive a Rolls
Got a Ferrari, too, but he comfortable in them ‘64s
That boss bitch took my attention off them silly hoes
But she can’t knock me off my grind, cuz I stand ten toes – like all the time
Cleats in the turf, we puts in work, provide a wave to surf
Club only for official members who started with me ground up from the dirt
Recognize your self worth
Then you make your name on this earth
They tried to play me, but I peeped ‘em first
Then backup cameras when that Beamer coupe reverse

[Bridge]
Down the mansion driveway
Automatic iron gates
Game sharp as razor blades
So high I could fly away

[Hook]
Throwing parties at the boat launch. Having high-speed chases with the coast guard
(Chases with the mother fucking coast guard)

Throwing parties at the boat launch. Having high-speed chases with the coast guard
(Chases with the mother fucking coast guard)

[Verse 2]
Lift the anchor, set sail
Charter course toward the mil
In the end we prevail
All bread, fresh or stale
At the shore where them fools await the bales
Or in the parking lot in the rain makin’ them cars fishtail
Slinging that raw fish scale
Underground brick sales
Only a boss in this deal
Gotta peep out the detail
Whipping the Porsche ‘round the guard rail
You could tell he was taught well


[Hook]
Throwing parties at the boat launch. Having high-speed chases with the coast guard
(Chases with the mother fucking coast guard)

Throwing parties at the boat launch. Having high-speed chases with the coast guard
(Chases with the mother fucking coast guard)
None of them bad bitches know y’all
You think you on but you so off
