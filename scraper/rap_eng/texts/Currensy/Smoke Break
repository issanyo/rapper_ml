Jet life, jet life

You should be rollin up by now, locate your lighters

Prime time
It's Mr. Go-left-on-a-bitch-who-can't-find-her-right-mind
I'm squeakin' past a yellow light doin' 65
Hope that wasn't one of them camera joints, traffic eyes in the sky
I'm kinda high, but you dumb twisted
I'm used to that killer shit so I maintain my pimpin',
I'm used to that killer shit so I maintain my pimpin'
While you over-highed and slizzard
And I'm laughin' at you slippin'
And yo bitch feelin' disgusted and miserable
She like "why" she "even here with you"
I'm puttin' air in my inner tubes
Black mags on my Haro
Hangin' from the wall
The allure of my home decor
Got these girls trippin', and frequently speakin' of return visits
A time machine: my lyrics
And the same thing for my garage dog, did you see what I just put in it?
We tryna compete with them Nascars
You noticin'
The style done got switched up, cause the last one got bit up
Yeah lil' homie out to get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up
This Jet Life ain't for everybody, this shit is reserved for us
Yeah lil' homie out to get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up
The style done got switched up, cause the last one got bit up
Yeah lil' homie out to get down, but I bet y'all can't keep up
