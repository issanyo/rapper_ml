[Intro: T.Y.]
Stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
Stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her

[Chorus: T.Y.]
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her

[Verse 1: T.Y.]
Yea, look
I stunted on yo' bitch in the worst way
I stunted on yo' bitch just the other day
I stunted on yo' bitch in my old school (my '83)
The way I stunted on yo' bitch should've made the news
I learned from the flyest in the game (my nigga Spitta)
Original creator of the Jet Planes (my nigga Spitta)
Everywhere I go somebody know my name
It only let me know that I'm doing my thang

[Chorus: T.Y.]
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
Heard my engine way before you seen me
Ran a stop sign 'cause I was speeding
Music hella loud trunk beating
Jamming my pops shit wishing they would free him
Son of a gangsta I get violent if it's needed
OG Cello say holla if I need him
We back to back in them exotics and we creepin'
Love tried to holla but I'm chillin' this evening

[Chorus: T.Y.]
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch be-
Before I fucked her

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Cinnamon rolls, ice in my gold
This nigga cold, he fucking froze
These bitches chose, because they know
I'm where the money at so she stay ready to go
Gang, capital G crush a lame
Down in the dust wipe the rims on my Mulsanne
No coming mane, stunting mane in the turning lane
Gold Dana Dane's low rider with the painted frame
Mama know my name because she follow players
She a fan of the big money and heavy weighters
Couple drops of Holy Water dripping from my bracelet
Stunting on the devilish bitches and they can't take it
Bitches making bedroom eyes and fuck me faces
Done it a few times in a few exclusive places
Perfect crime I kill it never leave no fuckin' traces
Lay my rhymes down it's never no lies inside
Might catch me in that '65 throwing up East Side

[Chorus: T.Y.]
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
I stunted on yo' bitch before I fucked her
