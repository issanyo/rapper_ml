[Intro: Curren$y]
We can handle this like Neanderthals
Or we can get into some player shit
(Jet Life)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Me and my dogs mashin', in a lowrider
Like four desperados, in a covered wagon
Wild, wild West fashion
Nigga, this here is that jet landin'
On uncharted grounds, nigga, finna plant my flag in this bitch
Ownership; rap money buyin' homes
Opening stores; add to it, multiply, hustle more
What else you think you livin' for?
The game is raw; show your young ones how to ball
Before they run the town, they gotta walk the walk
Avoid the chalk, the yellow tape, the morgue at all costs
Cause niggas'll certainly try to take you off to be the boss
They lost; I been found that out
Think how heated Black was on the couch
At the basement of Bundy's grandma's house
...Game tapes

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uh, still can't look when Rico killed Mitch
Everyday in the city, you hear the same shit
All you can do is trust a few
Stay alert for the weak links in your crew
That shit'll get you hurt or worse
Shit real; don't say that I ain't warn you first
...Game tapes, Game Tapes
They gotta walk the walk
Avoid the chalk, the yellow tape, the morgue at all costs
Cause niggas'll certainly try to take you off to be the boss
They lost; I been found that out
Think how heated Black was on the couch
At the basement of Bundy's grandma's house
...Game tapes
