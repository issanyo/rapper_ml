[Intro]
Yeah, these planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload
No negotiation, one price final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work pure ain't nobody step on it

[Chorus]
These planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload
No negotiation, one price final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work pure ain't nobody step on it
Count up that loot every morning
Ball hard keep the scoreboard lit
Point guard

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Doing dabs in the lab
'76 house made of glass
No rims, slidin' on bags very thin wheels
Butter Timbs, butter raps
Butter leather seats nigga peel back the rag, top
Ride out pedal mash
To the hideout firing up gas
Bitch that's what I'm bout
Running through checks you just running your mouth
Not only collecting checks, I been writing 'em now
Monopolize, we ride, customizing the South
488 Spyder when the stars come out
Every weekend we bringing new cars out
Cause all during the week we was in the workshop
Getting that workout, over a million served
Things you civilians wouldn't know about, word

[Chorus]
These planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload
No negotiation, one price final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work clean ain't nobody step on it

[Verse 2: Street Wiz]
Uhh, know I keep it focused got my mind set
I'm just working on another project
Imma keep it pushing, I ain't never running out of time yet
So I keep it ripping from my Skyjet
Yeah you know the business, gotta keep it pimping every line fresh
From the top to bottom its a progress
Getting to the riches, know I'm steady fishing in my pond yes
I'm just steady searching cause my time set
Know I'm with the women, ten toes down keep it all G
When I grab the mic they gon' applaud we
When we hit the building, set life skyscrapers
All my niggas in the lear you gotta fly later
We just come to kill the show the floor vibrating
Know I'm talking through the booth niggas got paper
Bitches tryna leave with us the bus high maintenance
Just off to the next state up in line kicking, bang

[Bridge]
Yeah, these planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Yeah, these planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order

[Outro]
These planes they land on the water
Got enough cargo to fill your order
Ship it by the boatload
No negotiation, one price final offer
If you don't get it somebody else want it
All this work clean ain't nobody step on it
Count up that loot every morning
Ball hard keep the scoreboard lit
Point guard, L
Ball hard keep the scoreboard lit
Point guard, yeah
Ball hard keep the scoreboard lit
Point guard
These planes they land on the water
These planes they land on the water
