[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Rolled up in a Rolls
With a few rolled up
Hoes eyes know real gold
So they chose us for show sluts
That gold nuts four bucks
But I only cop them hoes donuts
Sun rose up last night that chapter close one
A new ep has just begun
Life was wrapped just until it's done
Though I never corporation reign forever
Did your car come with the umbrella
You can ask your bitch how soft is my leather
She seen it she couldn't believe it
She touched it she wanted to fuck it
Infatuated with niggas that's hustling
Always stunting I got a whole lot of shit started
With nothin
Now they all know when I'm coming
They roll out the carpets and they playing trumpets
Keys to the city, keys to the Bentley, keys to a grand piano playing symphony
Killing these niggas no sympathy
Stepping on they necks with my SB Tiffanys
Say she the one like Billie Jean
But bitch I don't love these hoes is you kidding me
How could I take you seriously
Would've fucked any nigga that wasn't a VIP
Oh you did that just to get with me
You bullshitting me hoe I don't roll with security
Got a few friends rolled in with me
Will somebody please come get this freak
Completely out my vicinity
For really G, I really be
Where the money go be it land air
Nigga rain, snow, out of space
Mahfuckin grind mode
Rolex presidential time code
Time froze
Though it wait for no man
Got sixty grand in my mini hand
Im a whole mahfuckin business man
In the Velour suit, and a headband
Like yeah man

[Outro]
Yeah
Realest
Chill
Pinky rings
Chill
Sorry for the Wraith
For real
