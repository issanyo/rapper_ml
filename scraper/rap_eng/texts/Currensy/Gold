[Verse 1]
More cash than she's seen in her life
Watch me make that twice, times that
Back of that tour bus banging 56 Nights
Her Future looking bright, show money nice
This show quality ice
I met her this evening
I could probably cut tonight
Studio for 10, make it before then
And we can get one in
Got to be a quicky though
Because you know I got the wife with me
And I don't need her on TMZ trying to hit me
Leveled up high class sluts trying to fuck with me
Saying she just want to get high
She a motherfucking lie
She just trying to be seen
Whenever I hit the scene
Hoping my designer home boys keep her fly
Privileges that you get for kicking in
With the realest niggas who in the biz
We is that shit, stay G and got rich
I never switch, never even considered it
Legitimately down for my niggas bitch
Land Rover the syndicate, all terrain
Killing shit, smacked the game up
Pistol whipped that hoe

[HOOK]
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Makes sense till your further on down the road
Makes sense till your further on down the road

[Verse 2]
Truth's revealed, lies get exposed
For this lifestyle I was chose
I was designed, I was built
And then I broke my own mold
Grind more, the only one I know
Hustling this music as if it were dope
A price quote from what I just wrote
Saran all over, kilo grams straight from the boat
I am the man, G code
I'm the road top class graduate [?]
Congratulate your dog, cause your dog cold
Baby I'm chilling, seven dobbies in my robe
Supreme clientele, zipping to a meeting in my ghost
Trust folk to be underground successful
Trying to situate yourself but your peeps need help to
You got to get it out the mud fool
Who else but you, what else is you supposed to do?

[HOOK]
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Makes sense till your further on down the road

[Outro]
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Makes sense till your further on down the road
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Makes sense till your further on down the road
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Everything that glitter really ain't gold
Money rolls, cars and clothes
This fast cash, it comes and goes
Yea, yea, yea, yea
