Often imitated never duplicated
The hero, unsung champion, uncongratulated
Through it all I keep it G
And that's what fascinates her
Cause she'd rather go with me
Than anyplace that you gon'take her
She can tell the fake one in the presence of the real
Cause my game tight: vacuum seal
Was bein' slept on like a cot in the shelter
Now them owners in my section like
"Spitta how can I help ya?"
She like, "What you involved in?"
I tell her construction, cause I really am
I built this whole empire from nothin'
I hear none of them niggas;
They don't stand for nothin
Like they're tied to their chairs
Trust me, I'm aware that it's cold
But it's fair
From the inside, looking out there
I see bitches waiting, niggas waiting, cops patrolling
Be careful, don't look them in they're faces
We holding, tryna get out the matrix like Neo and them

[x2]
Yeah, we in the lab
Cut and package it up
To distribute it to the public
Hit the block stuntin'
Them hoes see what I drove
Wan' know if I'm selling drugs
No, bitch, I'm just Dope

The all-natural, non-tobacco rapper is back at you
Just in case you though I quit scribbling tablets
I parachute out of bed cause I woke up still high
From the previous evening of getting toe-up
Told 'em before, but they didn't believe it
I showed 'em over one million flows to be chose from
Sixteen switches; Spitta still get them bitches wide open
Like my front gate when I'm pulling my Camaro in
Got your girl in tow, carrying a tote bag
With some clothes, cause it be a few before she come back
Making moves with your's truly in the car makes her a drug mule
Cause I'm on narcotics stronger than a schedule II- Oo!
I keeps it funky when I come through
You coping with hard times;
Only thing hard of mine is my denim, fool
Founding member of an influential crew- JETS, nigga!
Now we've formally been introduced

[x2]
Yeah, we in the lab
Cut and package it up
To distribute it to the public
Hit the block stuntin'
Them hoes see what I drove
Wan' know if I'm selling drugs
No, bitch, I'm just Dope

And we already showed you how to cook up, cook up
You trying to find the JETS? Just look up, look up
You trying to find your girl? I done took her, took her
The JETS is in the house, fool
Yeah, and I still got that drug flow
Spit that shit that makes them bitches eyes roll
And when them skeezers see what I drove
No, bitch! I'm just--

[x3]
Yeah, we in the lab
Cut and package it up
To distribute it to the public
Hit the block stuntin'
Them hoes see what I drove
Wan' know if I'm selling drugs
No, bitch, I'm just Dope
