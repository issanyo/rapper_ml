[Verse 1]

Sucka ass niggas keep stealing
The real ones keep building more shit
Clown shit that I'm not feeling
Too much, cut that bullshit, snuff they dealings
Mainstream got it all fucked up
You want the real dope then you gotta come to us
Underground niggas papered up
Fuck that award show
Get 'em tickets to my bitch like "y'all go"
I gotta get these bars wrote, that raw coke
Musical key loads, boat loads, car loads
Hollywood celebrity types and hood stars know
Your existence is hanging in the balance bro
Residuals is critical, we need them stacks kid
Wake up to them bowls, no cereal
Plane materials is how I flow
If I write about it then believe it's what I know
That's why it comes so easy to me
You see literally I flow like a river current
While them other niggas fronting, finna say fuck it
Star write screen plays
Swear my life like a movie in so many ways
Aw man

[Verse 2]

I'ma kill a niggas spirit when I pull up in this
The kid cruising by without going into the event
Crew members in attendance so I'm represented well
I was in the studio with that triple beam scale
New Beamers, swerve 'em in the rain, make 'em fishtail
Reckless, though I mean well
My intentions were good, but my niggas too hood
You was talking down on the set and it got back to 'em
Now my dawg highly upset, I gotta watch what he doing
Cuz if he catch you slipping he might do something stupid
I worked to hard for this to see my niggas lose and being foolish
I was aware the snakes was there when I moved in
But that money make it easier for home improvements
Make sure that you trust your shooters
The closest ones to ya be the ones that'll do ya
I ain't have to tell ya
