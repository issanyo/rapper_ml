[Verse 1]
A lime to a lemon my Jetset women
Say she only feel alive when she wit em
Jet Life tryna show she ride or die even if it kill her
I guess thats why I dig her
She throwin up the set in all her pictures
I come get her - smoke dilla through the cracked windows
Heavy conversation light dinner
Destination and into the navigation
A GPS we kept from an out-of-state rental
Underneath the moon and stars riding to that Krizzle
You like that sound, that's my nigga he from Mississippi
I be on tour with him you should come along with us
Champagne, flutes, cheese, crepes, and fruit
Fuck you know, Four Seasons drunk
Rolling a joint hitting buffet tables the fuck up
Get you back to your man's 'fore he knows whats what
Your friends hating on you saying you lucked up
A lime to a lemon my Jetset women
They allow me to get in where ever I fit in
I stop by we be chillin’ and I get high wit em
She caught three nuts but she never catch feelings
And bitch with that disposition we can count millions
I see that in ya got that 420 vision
’98 livin’ these iceberg sweats got 20 racks in em
Light Snax, Andretti
