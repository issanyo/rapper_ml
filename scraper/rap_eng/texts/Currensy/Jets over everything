[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Due to knowledge
Due to few dollars
I'm due to the mileage
Tracks record Exec's write me checks for that
Bust my ass XXL show respect for that
Bitches coming out they dress for that
Yeah I step in New Orleans
Where it's more than the french quarters and flood waters
Niggas bringing burners to the barber
Remember nigga tried to murk ??? before he left for Africa
Good niggas beware the devil after us, hazardous
But through it all I bounce like a Spalding
On the court at Madison Square Garden
Dressed in my garments by Ralph Lauren
Keep luggage packed for the tourin'
These other rappers lacking my endurance
Frowned upon by those who call themselves rap's purists
Their hate is in the air but the pilots fly through it
If you're not familiar with it this is jet music
An audio tutorial on how the best do it

[Hook]
G5 in the sky I'm on that plane
You know what I claim
Jets over everything
My name is in these streets
My name is my name

You know what I claim
Jets over everything
(x5)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture
To show 'em what a nigga look like when a nigga get his dough up
I was built for the bread I'm a toaster
Fly by you in a vintage ninety's testarossa
Keep it cool dude, watch how you approach him
Friend or foe, you never know 'till niggas deadly close
Lessons learned through the years of burying peers
Thank God for the ones who are still here
Shift gears from the place that I steer, foreign engineer
The only thing you buying that's imported is your beer
Pioneer speaking, not pioneer speakers, buy a lot of sneakers
Chief up the finest cheeba, half baked
'Bout to pass out off the same shit Mr. Nice Guy passed out
Never putting nothing wack out
So much dope shit stored you call my hard drive a crack house

[Hook]
