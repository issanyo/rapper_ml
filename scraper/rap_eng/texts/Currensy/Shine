[Verse 1]
Bitches all over ya cuz the game chose ya
Maintain your composure know what your rolling for
In the lane like a bowling ball
In the gutter like a bowling ball
Selling bars in the chocolate wall
In the car playing Stacey Lavi song
Job well done like a steak on the floor rug
Day hoe what ya say?
Back seat of the Bentley stage coach
Hearts and Carriage bitch
Don't get embarrassed
All ill advised, this year [?]
Hurt my standards
Iron lungs on the bong or the chalice
Bring it on where its at
Stand in the zone when I rap like cooking the zone
Now the realest rap when you made crack
Matter fact I feal this shit its so real
Every beat I eat like it's my last fucking meal
Spit that shit make you feel so rich
Cash me a card against all party in my backyard
Done worked hard for it and I got rewarded
But these niggas rather clap at me than applaud me
Want a nigga rep tarnished, but a nigga name flawless
Stainless not a scratch on it
Gorgeous, as that tall amazon standing by that race car
Wonder who she waitin' on
Its the Don, bitch
