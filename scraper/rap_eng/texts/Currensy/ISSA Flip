[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah
Walked out the club last night with a bottle
Still got the light on in that bitch
Like we in the section and shit
Uh

[Verse: Curren$y]
41 millimeter it look like a flying saucer
On my wrists
In my wraith sliding how a fucking boss does
Swung my Ferrari though H Town
They thought it was Sauce Walka
Much respect to homie, but naw I'm Peter Parker
Spider Man, out New Orleans always crawling in them foreigns
I been on it, six this morning keep me balling
Thank the lord he done it for me
Made sure I could afford it if I want it
Wide body Porsches, mama legs is like a horse's
Dab rigs and torches
Got wax slabs in portions
You can have all you can handle
Baby that's my final warning
In the club it was storming
There was dollar bills falling
Had my chunky tennis bracelet with the Eskimos living on it
Said bitch its a brick, frozen Fiji on my shit
Roll and lit, like a Bic
Or a Zippo when it flick
Its a-
Yeah
And that's
Yup
