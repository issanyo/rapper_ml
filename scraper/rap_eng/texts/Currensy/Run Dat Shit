[Hook]
When I'm off in the zone
My niggas telling me run that shit

[Verse 1]
Shit for high priced SUVs, long nights palm trees
Cuff link sleeves, them niggas ain't these
Extraordinary gentleman, this is the league
Wrinkle free, pimpin, my styles straight like 9:15
Jet Code make Watergate look like a hair-brained scheme
Your hoes wanna be Taken, no Liam Neeson on the scene
Blue waters, white sands, sticky green
Enough niggas talk shit, Jet niggas talk rich
Porches, fortress, horses afford this
Then try step up, y'all got me messed up
Basketball shorts on red carpet, my girl dressed up, and I'm coolin
I'm just at the premier cause my homeboy was in the movie
I would be hoopin on my front yard point guard shit
With my neighbors son OG shit I do cause I truly am one

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And they still trying to build that case
Want me to pay for murdering all these tapes, what can I say
Its still money over bitches, we stick to the script here
Magazine pictures credit every stitch that I wear
Never been one of those caught up in the fab
They say its out of style, I bring that shit back
Designers know it makes sense to chop it and burn hash
And let me skim through their next season sketch pad
I'm never mad, just mad high my guy
From this altitude you wipe a doves tears when they cry
The forefather of the fly
No paternity test your style got my eyes left
And its Jets til the motherfucking next life
So sweet candy stripes on my Vette, if I say it I show it
You think I get it for free how I smoke it
My dude wanted loot but he tossed me a few free O's and shit
All these rappers need is a hook to go and fish
For crappy deals but Im way too real
Mothafuckas kept half assing until
Warner Bros came to the table with the table
Now theres room for my whole set, now my niggas able
Eat 'til we got the itis, bitch we on fire
Marlo on the screen yeah bitch we on the wire
You talking too much bitch go sit up there with the driver
