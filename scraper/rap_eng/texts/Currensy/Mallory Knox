Yeah, yeah
La la la la

Snatch the tint off the window
Sorry for the wraith
Smokin' killa with my bad one on the interstate
Just left the safe, we was depositing cake
Showed her the way now she making her own plays
Back at the crib, high then a bitch
Smoke, fuck, think of more ways to get rich
Real life movie shit
Big budget, Spielberg shooting it
But its a documentary cause we really doing it
Catching stunts on the bitch no camera tricks
She couldn't handle it Ferrari, Lamborghini shit
Babygirl get a grip, catch your breath smoke this shit
Take a whiff that's how paper smell
A dab of Chanel on my collar make sure i remember her well
And I did, that's why I stayed a lil bit longer
Cut one more time & then i slid...

Lalalala x2
