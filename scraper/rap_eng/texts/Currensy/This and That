[Intro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ain't got no diamonds on that one but I got diamonds on this one
I don't be fucking on that one 'cause I get money from this one
Yeah yeah yeah

[Hook]
Ain't got no diamonds on that one but I got diamonds on this one
I don't be fucking on that one 'cause I get money from this one
Ain't got no rims on that one but I got rims on this one
I got a house for the fam, a condo for the killers
I be sleeping in that one, I be smoking in this one

[Verse 1]
Ain't got no diamonds on that one but I got diamonds on this one
Hold my watch out the window, I don't need turn signals
Stuck my hands in the blender, got precious cuts on my fingers
Put solitaires in the middle just to picture the ice dripping
I pull up on bitches, they making fast decisions
Risk it all to get it, with a ballin' nigga
My Impala on Daytons, it be crawling or skating
She been waiting for a chance to break me off, she gon' take it

[Hook]
Ain't got no diamonds on that one but I got diamonds on this one
I don't be fucking on that one 'cause I get money from this one
Ain't got no rims on that one but I got rims on this one
I got a house for the fam, a condo for the killers
I be sleeping in that one, I be wylin' in this one

[Verse 2]
Hold my watch out the window, haters watch how it glitter
From the ground I did it, you trying to start in the middle
Ain't got the heart to build it, you was placed here
One of your niggas did that for you
The machine a motherfucker when they push that button
All of a sudden they love you
But you better drop hits all summer
Or how soon they forgetting, you'll be past tense
With this lifer shit is different and for them I always mention

[Hook]
Ain't got no diamonds on that one but I got diamonds on this one
I don't be fucking on that one 'cause I get money from this one
Ain't got no rims on that one but I got rims on this one
I got a house for the fam, a condo for the killers
I be sleeping in that one, I be wyling in this one
