[Intro]

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Never change
It's a dirty game
But we still playing, predicting rain
We say fuck the weatherman cuz, we still shine
Fuck what y'all sayin'
Meetin deadlines
Due date came I was prepared
I had my shit straight
We really be out there
Rollin up getting paid
When you saw I was bossin' in the fast lane
When you saw me it was weeds of the finest strain
A couple niggas who done rolled with me through everything feel me mane
I think my city tryna kill me mane, but I love it
That's why I do so much for it
Ferraris in storage, underground garages, and Porsches
Smoked out in my fortress
Plottin on some more shit
Restaurant early, I met the sexiest hostess
She liked my condo view so now she in my mirror posing
My newest muse baby girl I do this shit for you
Ears open, eyes glued so she wet
I perfectly set the mood, way iller than dude
Bitch you into Mr. Who's Who
So many tycoons in one room
Arm candy I brung dazzling 'em, unraveling some'n
Thought they was tight, wrapped or somethin'
Macking or somethin', she'll take that lame game leave 'em with nothin'
Come back to bed and play Jenga with your stacks fool we hustling
Fuck you thought, a real boss
Niggas is lost

[Bridge]
To us it's nothin'
To you it's somethin'
Play Jenga with your stacks fool we hustling

[Outro]
Never change
It's a dirty game
But we still playing, forget the rain
We say fuck the weatherman cuz, we still shine
Fuck what y'all sayin'
Meet deadline
Due date came, I was prepared
I had my shit straight [?] getting paid
When you saw I was bossin' in the fast lane
