[Intro: McKenzie Eddy]
So I see the setting sun, and I get to feeling numb
Down on that side of town, back where no fun's around
Back where I felt like me and everything you want to be
Just flows so easily, some I think may call it free

[Hook: McKenzie Eddy]
So (Low)
So, so (Low)
I can't believe you (Called)
So (Low)

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Yeah, as the joint burns
To the point that it stinging my finger
Tracks my talk show platform
Part Phil Donahue, part Jerry Springer
Momma come when I bring her
She go where I send her, kept it trill from the beginning
From Square One maintain Square Business
Don't concern yourself with my mingling with other bitches
So crafty, mastered the flow
Alaska cold, silent foot assassin approach
High when I stroll
Not even leaving foot prints in the snow, you know

[Hook]

[Bridge: McKenzie Eddy]
So I see your face again, back where I've been traveling
Time, I think it seems, to have it's grip on me
Friends, they say they call it for you, no matter what I offer you
Can't believe in history, living in this misery

[Hook]
