[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Eastside just like everytime
Handing out my mixtape with a neck brace
Do it the Jet way
Vintage Chevys
Doors I close these hoes can't forget me
Section 8, stretch them out professionally
Wanna lay up and nestle with me
Build connections with me, but love you'll never catch me
I'm on the west the next day
As my indo grow on the hammock
Sampling some of the potentest plants ever grown
Mainstream I'm known but underground my home
Low ride but I'm high off the bone
See I'm more like both Cheech and Chong
Plus my money long
As the Supreme line when they got a drop on Thursday morn
All on the strength of these rap songs
And they try to say the boom-bap gone
Spitta turn the sound back on
Mothfucker yeah that's your day in the zone
Everytime I light up another zone

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Andretti
Sucka ass niggas ain't ready
Never compare me
And they try to say the boom-bap gone
Hot Spitta turn that sound back on
And they try to say the boom-bap gone
La da da da da da
Eastside
