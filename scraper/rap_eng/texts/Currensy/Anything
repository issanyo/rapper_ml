[Intro]
We can handle this like neanderthals
Or we can get into some player shit
Stoned on ocean
Here we go

[Verse 1]
The interior on my Cadillac make em sick
Won't you please give em' a bucket they can puke in (throw up in)
Act like its killing em to see me get rich
Probably die when they see me in my new shit
Slinging drugs but this music moving units
Baby close her eyes listenin to it, she dream of screwing
Mind control, pimpin' my pen
Ink drippin' down the whole stroll, I get payed again (yeah)
Cold game, got me in that mulsanne
Cold game, colder than my champagne
Cold game, writing that cocaine
(yeah)

[Verse 2]
Drop it if you got it
Talkin' bout them tops, Three hundred thousand dollar exotic
Smokin' out jet fuel talkin' like pilots
Hit the vocal booths and lay down them narcotics
I was contemplating stoppin'
Got an email from mos def he say he's still watchin'
[That's big bro so that means a lot, he way over seas so you know how them phones acting and shit]
Cold game, got me in that mulsanne
Cold game, colder than my champagne
Cold game, writing that cocaine
That'll buy me anything
That'll buy me anything
Everything
Whatever man

Keep the heat in it chevy on them switches nigga
Smoking weed in it rolling and I'm pimping in it

[Outro]
Cold game, got me in that mulsanne
Cold game, got me new pinky rings
Cold game, got me this heavy gold chain
Cold game, spit it right in that cocaine
Cold game, What you even know man
Cold game
