[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Eyeing Venetian blinds for peace of mind
Sooner or later them motherfuckers'll try
Still goin' hard, though the critics say I'm blind
Say I lack dimension, say my lyrics are one-sided
It's the saga of the stoned Temple pilot
When it's all said and done them motherfuckers'll say I was a prophet
Spoke about the Bentleys right before I got 'em
Physical evidence that you could touch that paper without that sucker behavior
Them niggas waterin' it down, we bring that flavor
'95 Air Max, Diamond Turf Deon
Sanders tied up and strapped clean and sharp
As a pack of thumbtacks in the laundromat, dog
On to that bullshit, so don't pull it
I hold potential like bullets, nigga
Might save your life and might kill ya
No sugarcoatin', no filter
The raw image right from the line of scrimmage
My nigga, you in it, uh

[Hook: Curren$y]
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother break 'em in the stairway
I wore his chain and held his beeper at the dice game
And said, "Yo, here come them people" when them laws came
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother break 'em in the stairway
I rocked his chain and held his beeper at the dice game
And used to say, "Here come them people" when the laws came

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Sacramento ballin', vintage shoppin'
Mitch Richmond, bodied, stop it, pop it, I get it
Cop it, rim it, drop it, stunt in it, they watchin'
Blades spinnin', choppy
Sure of myself, but not cocky
Prayin' for the health of everybody around me
Prayin' that my moves only become more godly
Rememberin' my first ride in a Maserati
In Miami with my homie Lil Wayne steamin' broccoli
Motivation, I thought about that shit constantly
Now I collect Ferraris and I drive around at top speed
Fuck probably, woodie, I gots to be
Smokin' these beats like marijuana leaves
Higher than the top of trees
Still good, down-to-Earth people
Super illegal, in that black rag
Diamond in the back that you mad at
You'll get murked through the mail
Serve digital anthrax (sucka)

[Hook/Outro: Curren$y]
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother break 'em in the stairway
I rocked his chain and held his beeper at the dice game
And used to say, "Here come them people" when the laws came
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother bake 'em in the dice game
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother break 'em in the stairway
I wore his chain and held his beeper at the dice game
And used to say, "Here come them people" when the laws came
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I'm still buckin' like five deuce four trey
I used to watch my brother kill 'em in the stairway
