I think it's a chain
Now we can all win
Rather than complain or rather go Halloween
Rather holding close don't fall in, I got to have it
Living in the same city limits
It's a small world everybody in the business
Don't know if stayin welcome, I
15 minutes being quit
What is this? can somebody explain it
It's kind of like
Don't make sense to the ordinary nigga
We maintain
What's the world?
Yeah, suck ers act like
All the good music
Bitches in
But I'm still drippin'
Talking
Love street
Haters only hating cause the fact they love me
Niggas hold budget 'cause I'm hustling
Hold your breath to your death
Tell the
We say
For the machine
Make me sneeze
Hope make it
Before I leave because
Down stairs just chillin'
I don't like my outfit, I need two more minutes
From the magazine 'cause I
Into your bitch name until I search engine
And
Speed em
We keep on tell em babe
After that you give a
And everybody wonder what I've made
I make the dough dance, master of the ceremony
All of your program
So let the show proceed, bring on the suckers MC's
When it's time to feed, so tonight we feed
From my winners street
Is superstar nigga
The dope
So when I campaign guess who wanna vote for me
Finally come up the air
Chillin in the long chair
The girl with the long hair and I ain't even there
Fly out, fly out, fly out, fly out
