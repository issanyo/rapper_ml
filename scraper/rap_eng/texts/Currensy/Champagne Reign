[Intro]
Smoking on the joint
Wanna tell my dog Joey Fatts thanks

Uh, the windshield wiper blades
Need to be changed, in my 600, soon
But we still driving through this monsoon
As Vish on the wheel, I'm in the passenger
Twisting that Kill Bill
Shit louder than a Dr. Dre Beats, pill
Phone to my ear, hold it there with my shoulder
Homie I could move a boulder from a Boost mobile
Roddy showed me how to do it when he came through the crib
I got that beat from Fatts
He played it for 5 seconds, I stopped him and told him
Damn homie, I gotsa have this bitch
When you listen, hope you envision a classic whip
With a classic tight, low key, nasty bitch
Rollin' like the Few Chosen
Diamonds and golden ornaments hanging from my neck
They compliment my clothing
Don't trip off how I dress, watch your motherfuckin' step
This the mother fuckin' Jets, suckas look up to the (set)

Big ass tables in my crib
We be eating and having meetings in here
On increasing this year's production of Audio Dope
Pumping it out, before they know they want mo'
Ain't nobody stepping on it, this shit as new as the morning bro
They sleeping on a nigga, I was on the bus touring
Two homes and four Rolexes later they waking up to him
Now viewing this in pursuit of my coupe
But this just music
Street distribution tactics
They getting high off it and high to it
I'm backing out the garage in the RR
Just how I said I would, and I did
Thought about it since I was a kid
Now I live it out, smoking big killer
Listening to Biggie Smalls in my big ass house
Nigguhhh
