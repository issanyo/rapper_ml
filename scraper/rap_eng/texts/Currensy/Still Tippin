[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Paint dripping off the frame like
Candy stripes as I
Lay in the landslide
Missey elliot can't stand the rain
I much rather be catching some rays outside
Sunshine on chevy's bitch we comin' down
Gettin' money not raking it up in piles
Each one a hunned' thous'
Clearly they must be clowns
If they don't know by now
We getting paper underground
Be surprised if you come around dream cars parked outside
My house Plus a Ferrari that I rarely take out
Actual facts is all that I'm about
Smoking weed too the vinyl copy of reasonable doubt
On the hottest MC's list they'll probably leave me out
So what I'm the highest & the flyest with no stylist
It's just my lighter & my Nike's
I think she like me
Cause she Dm'd to write me
Invited me politely
I smashed & I was outie
