[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
2017, we ain't gon' waste a minute
We done assembled the family
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Brought some of the family
Brought some of the toys to Atlanta
We got in the studio, we drop some hammers
Quick lil' six piece
Like a mission statement for the company
Let you know what we gon' do this year
Pretty much our own shit

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Them niggas show they true colours when you come up
They don't want you in motion, they want you stuck
They see you goin', hope you fuck it up
Don't know how you can hang around them fools so much
That's the ones you don't trust, dope in the pot
Somebody turn the stove up
Spitta in the cut with twenty cones stuffed, you know what
Finna fuck somethin' up, show off
Live from New Orleans, there's no love
That mean when it come suckers, we got no love
Cuban links and hoodie mane, Range truck
When I go to sleep that's all I can think of

[Hook: Curren$y]
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas got on the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas wearin' the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
Look, hotbox the Range
All these diamonds on me, you can go in skates
Yeah a couple of bitches comin' my way
We'll run the world in a couple days
Came back with nothin' but the cake
Chevy ridin', yeah they make the ground shake
I be grindin' like every damn day
When it's time to hustle, know they don't pay
When it's said and done, I'mma be the one
Nigga talkin' hottest underneath the sun
All these niggas with all that sneak dissin'
Knowing they ain't gon' drop nigga
Jet life, we 'bout stuntin'
Came through in H1 Hummers
Lay laws now they all know
Had a kick if you tryna score
Straight to the block when I get of the road
No, I will never forget, by my wo's
Smell that killer weed all of my clothes
In the lab bout to drop off a load
Flood the streets with that Audio Dope
Yea we known to come at they throat
Land on mine I let that blow
Don't touch no bitch don't lust no hoe

[Hook: Curren$y]
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas got on the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas wearin' the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life

[Verse 3: Cornerboy P]
Fresh paint, tens beating tryna blow that inch
Playing with it, bad bitch like what you doin' with her
Tell that bitch name a car we pullin' up in it
Just got a new Jet Life piece I never tuck my shit
Dirty on me, that thirty on me ridin' dirty in it
Woes with me, work in it still swerving in it
Dope boy, word is she fuckin' Corner Boy
Hustle hard, bought a watch then another car
Stayed down, on these clowns played my part nigga
Doin' numbers, learned that shit from the start
How you really feel, it's really real I'm really in the field
Defense, cornerback and P ain't never lackin'

[Hook: Curren$y]
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas got on the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas after the same thing
On the field like a football team, Jet Life
Jet Life, all my niggas wearin' the same chain
Pullin' up in all kind of machines, Jet Life
