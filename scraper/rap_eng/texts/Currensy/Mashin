[Chorus]
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversatin' with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversatin' with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game

[Verse 1]
I'm jammin' to Max B, we low in these leather seats
Yo' hoe wanna be with me and she bold, she don't care who see
Andretti OG all I smoke in my Rolls
Represent the NO, light anywhere that I go
All my jewelry stay froze, wrist cold, ice yellow gold
Cash flow too thick to fold, stacks like erry show
In the mode this year, I grab the hustle by the throat
Sleeper hold, never lettin' go
You don't believe you'll get shown
In a six grain coupe, with the brains blown
Bottom bitch on the wheel, while I stuff up another cone
You dont believe you'll be shown, huh
I like your bitch, she will be flown in

[Chorus]
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversating with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversatin' with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game

[Verse 2]
See what I'm in it for, when I open that Bentley door
Mink on the floor, the stinkiest O, 28 grams to smoke
Bitches was laggin' on me, but now they want tag along
'Cause they smell the money cologne, success in the air
And the aroma strong, she know what she want
She know who a don in the game
She know who a pawn and a lame
She know who a boss, she know who lost
She know who runnin' things
Walkin' the walk and talkin' that talk
She know where the G's parked, she recognize all my cars

[Chorus]
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversating with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game
Mashin' in the rain
Only conversatin' with bitches who put me in position to get paid
These hoes is all the same
Baby my presence is a blessin', recognize who put you on game
