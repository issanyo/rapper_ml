Yeah
Champagne Files
Wasting no time
Gold cables 'round my neck
Diamond letters, cursive checks
Pick of the litter, never said I was the best
Just worry about my progress, all about my checks
You think they playing checkers
This is Call of Duty, not chess
My home boy got shot in his chest
He died in his Corvette
I cried myself to sleep and went to school the next morning
Upset
The life I live, you wouldn't believe
The that I did, the shit that I done
We used to bring the big homies the guns
They seen something in me
So they swooped me up swiftly
Focus on my music early, now they seen me killing it
OG in the underground scene
If you talking 'bout them then you got to be talking about me
Trying to be a legend while I'm still living
Trying to have my whole team in golf stream 6's
Federal agents got their bulletin board
Pinning up pictures
But they don't know the contraband is only in my lyrics
Nigga
