[Verse 1]
Yeah, my weed lit, my glass chill
Couldn't be concerned less how a hater feel
Car service only opportunity for rest
In between destinations a lil' hibernation
Life under the scope I gotta stay fresh
They just wanna see ya fallin'
The only reason the cameras out when ya walkin'
The only reason they listenin' when ya talkin'
Waiting on ya to contradict yaself
Albeit evict yaself from the house
Like when Beth instigated that situation
When Tami got David kicked out
Suckers tryin' figure my angle
Puzzled by my shuffle icky wood in the bengals
Adjust my wing rudders in the prescence of danger
Drop bombs on them niggas from the middle
And stay calm knowin' we belong on the top
But we ain't trippin'
Cause we'll get there in a minute
Yeah, that's the statement for the mission
Swiss movement so my watch ain't tickin'
Who yo crew is
Them niggas is bums
Throwin parties don't any bitch come
They all at my art showin'
Me and my folks gettin drunk
Bangin' my sound from the wall mounts

[Hook]
Yeah, life under the scope
Everyday is a test
It's all day
Go, full speed, full court
Media, press
They just wanna see ya fuck it all up
Turn over, make ya give the ball up
They just wanna see ya fuck it all up

[Verse 2]
(Yeah)
Vintage egg chairs hangin' from the ceilin'
Naked beauties and plush pillows in em
Incense and fresh linen
I spit that complex venom
The real niggas it strengthens
The fake niggas it kills them
And the Big homie said
That he still got visions of the rooftop
As do I
George Jetson, Jefferson
Deluxe apartment in the sky
Niggas can't downplay me baby
I'm too high
Pilots speak I crafted these in my Impala seat
A New Orleans nigga
And I'm way in the NYC weed twistin'
On a mission and I'm fishin' for my nigga Ski Beatz
I been in the game, OG
Seen fools blow up
And blow it low key

[Hook]
