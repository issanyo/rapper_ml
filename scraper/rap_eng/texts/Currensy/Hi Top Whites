[Verse 1]
Day in the life
Woke up to what we didn’t smoke last night
Got right, got high
I got hibachi leftovers, little steak fried rice
I got fresh and select what to drive up
Swear, it’s like GTA 5 out
Swear, it’s like NBA Live
Weather type, gorgeous outside
Ferrari horses galloping from the fortress
Now when you rolling, women notice and some approach us
Some of 'em hoes and shit, some of 'em worth it, some of 'em sorcerers
But nobody’s perfect
H-Town, south swinging, shawty think I’m drunk swerving
Naw, love, I’m driving like this on purpose
Or just banging with my joint lit
Now she rolling with a boss cause she deserve it

[Hook]
I seen this badass bitch in some hi top whites
I seen this badass bitch in some hi top whites
Then I met a badass bitch in some hi top whites
Now I got a badass bitch in some hi top whites

[Verse 2]
I’m a motherfucking racecar
Nigga, you the motherfucking bait car
Don’t even be on bad bitches' radar
Jet life, we in the house like baseboards
This kush I had to fly to L.A. for
This wax I had to fly to the bay for
Bad bitch that I wish I could’ve stayed for
But that ain’t what a nigga get paid for
That’s how it is, wish that I could say more
Don’t be like that, girl, keep it playa
You know a nigga grind on major
But I be back, keep your hair the same way, girl
I put the story on paper and the weed in the air
Pretty cars, pretty bitches, I done had my share
But I had to tell y'all the one
'Bout the one that I met in them ones

[Hook]
