[Intro: Corner Boy P]
I ain't no super hero
But ain't too much a nigga can't do

[Chorus: Corner Boy P](x4)
Imma park it wherever I want
Smoke wherever I want
Buy whatever I want
Hit her whenever I want

[Verse 1: T.Y.]
Yea hoe I do what I wan' do
Everyday in the lab like Pro Tools
Whip so wide can't even come through
Whip so wide tell 'em better make room
Every motherfucker know what I be on
To the bank back and forth like ping pong
Yea we fly high no Jim Jones
Smoking on killa, Cam'ron
Had to pay the price to get my engine right
Now I'm leaving niggas at the red light
Got your baby momma on that all night flight
On that all night flight to get my money right
30 pointers on my left and right
Corner Boy in that yellow light
I'm behind him in that black night
With a plaque in the window saying Cruise Life
Watch where you step lil nigga
We be them Jets lil nigga
Keep yo' ass in respect lil nigga
Park the whip wherever I wanna
All my money smell like marijuana
Bitch I'm tryna be a land owner
Build my own fucking planet on it
Buy a jet and then land on it
Put some beach and a sand on it

[Chorus: Corner Boy P](x4)
Imma park it wherever I want
Smoke wherever I want
Buy whatever I want
Hit her whenever I want

[Verse 2: Corner Boy P]
Answer the bitch text whenever I want
I could hit her whenever I want
Hustle from the first to the end of the month
Wear the Fendi and the Louis 'cause I want
Gold D's on the regal I'm the cooker
[?] ass niggas talking 'bout what they woulda
Chevy still in the shop it ain't ready
[?] it ain't ready
Plane land just know I'm getting paper
Bitch favorite question, would you throw it later
You know my last worry, a nigga that's hating
Rabid ass bitches, probably got rabies
I just bought a Rollie give a fuck about a AP
Used to live in the [?] house [?]
I parked three on the lawn and got [?]
That '96 I might paint that bitch next week
I got a ratchet ass bitch she from Zone 6
I might fly that bitch in when I leave
Blow hella trees, I had to adjust my sleeves
I need that bezel to breathe
Nigga it's P, won't hear no fuck shit bout me
My cars lined up on the street
Won't quote no price on a P
Won't fall in love with no freak
Won't pull up in no car with me

[Chorus: Corner Boy P](x4)
Imma park it wherever I want
Smoke wherever I want
Buy whatever I want
Hit her whenever I want

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Hop the fuck out
Middle of the street nigga fuck what you talking bout
Already know the driveway like a parking lot
How many cars I got
Got 10 at the crib I got 3 by my bitch I got 7 in storage now
I got a problem if I like it I buy it girl I'm not slowing down
Hol' on, fuck that where the dough at?
Anywhere I go I'm gon' smoke at
And the diamond [?] was throwback
And stepped in in it I was smelling like the whole pack
Slid by my lil chick and left five points
Watched Super Fly smoked five joints
Jet Life from the baseline, that's money every time
Sure as a wine always drinking wine
Sure as my yachtmaster Rollie shine
Sure as my mufucking girl fine
They know our 24 hour grind
Jet Life, forever high
Jet Life, we never die
If you ever say that he high as I
You know that nigga mufucking lie

[Chorus: Corner Boy P](x4)
Imma park it wherever I want
Smoke wherever I want
Buy whatever I want
Hit her whenever I want
