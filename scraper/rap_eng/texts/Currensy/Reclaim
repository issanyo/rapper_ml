[Verse: Curren$y]
Truman got me booming like them system jeeps
Watching Sunset Park wearing my pistol Pete
You talk Jazz jersey
You gotta wear the right kicks with these
I keep a closet full of crispy cleans
Usually seen full of green
In case something pretty and mean
Bad bitches that'll kill you
She on my team
These small faces getting mildew
Let's spend this cheese I'm
Trying to buy back the block
Trying to subtract my top at the red light
In the Chevrolet gumdrop
Candy paint my six-tre just left the sweet shop
And this just in
I got my check from Reebok
That's big bread, heavy shit
It broke the mailbox
Bumping legendary Mac
I'm on that shell shock
Rooftop bar at the hotel
I exit in a helicop
They give you gunshots before they give you props
They just praying that your single flop
They not prosperous
Grown men gossiping
Acting like they should be wearing night gowns and shit
Nigga you a girl
Go somewhere and do your lashes
I'm travelling passport, atlass, and a fat assed bad bitch
Figuring kick it with me some cool shit might happen
Reading genius screen plays as we're smoking these trees
These Hollywood types
They just my colleagues
They'll never be my friends
Unless they're really Gs
Freeze

[Outro: Curren$y]
Yeah
JLR work 'em
Even when it look like we're partying
So excuse the fact that we've been driving around in Ferraris and things
And Rolls Royces been parked outside the buildings
Trust me we in that mother fucker shooting a video
Or its verses being laid down
If we're popping a bottle of champagne
We be celebrating that a check just cleared
And there's still work being done
So don't get it twisted
Mother fuckers just want to do
What they see you doing
They don't want to do
What you're really doing
You feel me
X the deal
They don't want to put the work in
They just want to spend the pay check
They don't want to do the shit
Be we do the shit all the time
Fo'20 Massacre, Jet Life roll out
