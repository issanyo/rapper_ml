[Verse: 1 Young Roddy]

And It's still jets at ya throat mang
And I'm still hearin voice from that po' man
Fuck getting rich let's get wealthy
For sure mane
What this audio dope, but niggas still a dope mane
Word to my brother trade, high stay roasted
Jets over everything niggas know my slogan
Sliding in the two door coup, picture me rollin
Bitch wanna get paid better get with the program
And I'm tryin cop that Porsche for the summer nigga
And let's keep it real them other camps ain't fuckin' with us
And I might be young but I ain't on no new shit
I'm in my Jet gear
Yeah I rock my crew shit
With no stunt double my life a movie
Uh, I've never been a fan of excuses
Blow smoke in the face of a nuisance
And if it's us against them you know who's losin'
Owwwww

[Hook:]
Ah is you crazy
Welcome to our winner circle baby
Uh my nigga & it's still
Jets over everything I put that on everything
Uh is you crazy
Welcome to our winner circle baby
Ah my nigga & it's still
"Good Sense" over everything I put that on everything

Owwww

[Curren$y talking]

One Time
We gotta thank Young Roddy for putting this together, making this possible
This next joint I light for Max B tho.....

[Verse:2 Curren$y]

Uh, this one got me thinking about a mark 7
Lincoln, sinkin', in the interior
Smell that beautiful stankin'?
Fort Knox my bracelet, my pinkie
Don't be mad at me
Talk to God, that's who's giving me
Anything I ask for
Wait until you see my next car
Smokin' big the bigavelli's bars
Bitch rollin up jernts just as fat as her ass is, dog
Man, how did I get here?
Worked so hard, want this shit so bad
Greatful for what I got but hustlin for what I don't have
Posted with my bitch from the Bay
Thinking of ways to stay rollin' up and gettin paid

[Hook]
