[Verse 1]
Streetcars banging up St. Charles
New Orleans is a work in progress
I can't afford to take the day off
My young niggas stacking up money off the eight balls
And they ain't never stepped in a pool hall
Shit's starting to break my heart
Cause I don't want that life for my niggas
I know we can be so much bigger
If the light got shined on my city
The world would be trippin'
Off how many talented people was in it
Other niggas had they little 15 minutes
And they ain't know what to do with it
But wait 'til I get it
I'mma stretch it like Armstrong
A million miles long
Plus, I'mma put a bunch of other niggas on
Spitta showin' love, he's far from selfish
I see a nigga strugglin', you know I'mma help him
Show my niggas how to go from ballin' to wealthy
And raise they kids up real nice and healthy
The streets so hot, all the road signs meltin'
I stay above that, I'm a fly ass falcon
Last night a nigga got clapped with a Magnum
The headshots made it look like Mahicans scalped him
My brother in the window with a chopper like Malcolm
While I'm in the homemade soundbooth rappin'
He say I got too much talent
And a flow that can change things
So that can make me a target of a hatin' assassin
Cause we done seen the worst of it happen before
The homie Slim got murdered right when he was about to blow
It's fear and loathing in the NO
Demons comin' from wild angles
The shit is wild dangerous
But I'm maintaining my cool like John Elway
Or Miles Davis
The first rap I wrote was five pages full of bullshit and lies
About me killin' niggas and flippin' pies
But when I got by myself, I found myself
And realized that if I was a child in these times
I wouldn't want to follow in the steps of these guys
Clown ass rappers
I'm waiting for the day that they primetime the realness
And sideline the whackness
The good niggas can't get in the real game
No matter how much promise we showin' at practice
Niggas listen to my mixtapes and jack my swagger
Get on TV with it, and then I gotta look at it
Good thing I got a sense of humor
So when it happens, I'm laughin'
They just makin' it more easier for me to travel on them
Run the snap on 'em, it's a wrap on 'em
Chronicles of a swag donor
Give five mics to the rightful owner
So we can wake hip-hop out of her coma
Spitta, yeah

[Outro]
Just like that
Four months on the road, nigga
F.S., Jets
Yeah, where haven't we been yet
