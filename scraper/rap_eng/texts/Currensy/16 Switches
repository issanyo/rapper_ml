[INTRO: CURREN$Y]
Yup, yea, yea, JETS, nigga
Fuck boys wondering if they bitch next
Spitta
Nigga
(Took another pull of the potent)
16 Switches Spitta
(Dope tracks, he dozin', spitta get them...)
Ya'll niggas scared of monsters?

[VERSE 1]
I don't bang, I spit the good rhymes
The whole scenery reminding me of Good Times
Cause I'm, posted, toasted up
By my hood bitch, she rolling up ganja
I'm reading over scripts for a HBO drama
Mo' zeroes, mo' commas
Mo' pretty drunk bitches piled in my Impala
6-3 drop top, just like Doughboy
Do we got a problem?
Hope not nigga, just tryna have a good time
Cause I heard there's hoes out
Whoa now, told her I don't like her
Rocking with her toes out
I'm after Jenny with the Foamposite Pennys
These niggas is actors
They need Emmys
These bitches wear me out like Fendi
Again, these niggas is actors
Give 'em all Emmys
These Bitches wear me out like Fendi
Spitta!

[HOOK]
I'm just lokin'
Sunroof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the three wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he goes in
Spitta get them bitches wide open

I'm just lokin'
Sunroof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the three wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he goes in
Spitta get them bitches wide open (open)

[VERSE 2]
I even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Spitta please don't quit
Cause you that shit
Them niggas ain't like you
They don't make that shit to smoke and ride to like you do"
I admit that it's true
I'm good at which I do
I can show you the proof
Cop a coupe and put the footage on YouTube
"Spitta you that nigga"
Ladies tell me on the daily
Hit my Myspace and put the ringtones on they cellies
I'm on the couch, eyes glued to the telly
Watching Family Guy
Waiting for Brian to sing "Peanut Butter & Jelly Time"
Rarely I'm seen on the clube scene lately
Cause in my city, it's a couple DJs hating
Homie I'm saying, na fuck it, I'm laying up in the crib
Swiss cheese, sliced turkey
On top of the Ritz
Cracker, that's that shit
When you get as high as I get
I got the munchies
Tell your honey make some more for me, bitch
(yea, yea, that's it, that's it, that's the one right there)

[HOOK/OUTRO]
Dope tracks, he dozin'
Spitta get them bitches wide open
I'm just lokin'
Sunroof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the three wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he dozin'
Spitta get them bitches wide open (open)

Lokin'
Sunrooof open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the 3 wheel motion
Throw him
Dope tracks, he dozin'
Spitta get them bitches wide open (open)

I'm just lokin'
Open
Took another pull of the potent
Hit the 3 wheel motion
He Dozin'
Get them, wide open
