[Chorus: Curren$y]
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Went home, parked that car came back with another one
And then I got another one, nigga I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Came back with another one, came back in another one
Went home parked that car came back in another one
Then I got another one, nigga I got another one

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Started the day in a Wraith
Ended the the night in your wife
Forgiato made the skates
I created this Jet Life
Conservative stunts with the ice
Still giving off light through the night
Couple killers ducked out of sight
But they inches away from your life
Stay cool, no sudden moves I'm criminal smooth
I done paid dues I done paid niggas who done paid you
I been the one you looked up to
I been the one that was coming through
Making music bout the shit too
Bet a nigga never met the fool
Bitch you'll probably never do it
Settle for a second best while I'm dipping in the coupe
Money up Testarosa with my windows down
Cutting through Malibu
Totally fucking radical with a bad bitch rolling fatter doobs
OG or Gorilla Glue, roll one fucking roll two

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Then I got another one, came back in another one
Went home, parked that car came back in another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Then I bought another one, then I bought another one
Then I bought another one, came back in another one
Went home parked that car came back in another one
Then I got another one, nigga I got another one

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
We making major plays, I hustle everyday
I'm nothing like these niggas, all they wan' do is hate
Back on that fly shit, like this was 2008
That sky blue G-Shock, with them ice creams on my feet
We in the game for millions, y'all in the game for bitches
The coupe can swallow the ceiling
Now we putting up signs that it's missing
Went to the gun show bought another one
So now my trigger finger itching
I swear I won't fold on my homies
On everything long as I'm living
You know we drive them Chevy's
I'm living my life like it's Belly
We smoking them big ol' buds
Gotta break it down with a machete
These fools ain't getting no money
And they don't got shit up in the bank
I spit that straight drop, take a dose tell me what you think
Make them drugs in the studio
Can't put myself 'round them stupid hoes
When we burn we burn two or more
And we don't move we let the shooters go
Introduced you to the high life
You only get one shot to do it right
Niggas mad 'cause they pockets tight
Past 11:30 run into a light
Gone

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Went home, parked that car came back with another one
And then I got another one, nigga I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Came back with another one, came back in another one
Went home parked that car came back in another one
Then I got another one, nigga I got another one

[Verse 3: Mr. Marcelo]
Started off in the 'jects, then I landed in the jet
I be balling in New York like I play for the Mets
Niggas tryna run game, but I chew it like bubble gum
At 16 I got my first Benz at 19 I got another one
21 I got another one, 25 I got another one
Nigga I'm from the streets, the definition of a hustler
I don't move without mines, in this jungle full of lions
'Fore I jumped off the porch, I was peeking through the blinds
Yea my bitch is light brown, but the dope is dark gray
I get money in my sleep, which means I get it all day
First I got an AK, then I got myself another one
Then I got myself some money, so I guess I fell in love with guns
Niggas talk that OG shit, they don't talk it like me
Pockets heavy as a motherfucker, so they ain't walking like me
This is is audio d, yea we got a few keys
OG by the pound, yea we got a few P's
Jet Life we the streets, real talk thats facts
One phone call dog I have them shooters moving like a pack
Had the front and the back, Magnolia to the East
I started off with 100, and turned it to 100 G's

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Went home, parked that car came back with another one
And then I got another one, nigga I got another one
Then I got another one, then I got another one
Came back with another one, came back in another one
Went home parked that car came back in another one
Then I got another one, nigga I got another one
