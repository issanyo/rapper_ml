(Verse 1: Curren$y)
Put the cheat code in, I brung my homie back to the game
I done that eyesight for the blame
Name on the side of the plane Jets Fool dot dot dot
Which ensues the reign will be continued
Flight Club from the display case we cop gym shoes
Living as any other grown kid would do
Remembering being 10, looking at OGs roll down the street wishing I was them
I superceded it, previous genius they see Spitta they tip they brims
My role perfected, my money invested, my interest collected
My collection of Chevrolets doubled
502 big block, anabolic steroid
Thats motor car muscle, its running word to mother
Running like the little man on my Play Cloths duffle
King of the jungle, bear with us you niggas is Snuggle
