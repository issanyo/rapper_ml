Watching Boardwalk Empire, feeling inspired
You can take it all over if you just tried it
So I tried it, liked it, got addicted
To the square footages and home insurances
Best way to get to it is the self way
Do it for thou. Like "What better time
Then the right now?"
Bending corners on these blocks
Making my rounds. Highed up
Baby girl love the way that I get down
This that headband, got a nigga royally high
Scratch headband, we gonna have
To call this a crown
Paint water wet on the Chevy, might drown
So fresh it almost wasn't ready
When you get your shot make sure you aim steady
Cause suckas gunning for your spot
The Jack Boyz drew a bull's eye on your drop
And you were still on the car lot
Them niggas ain't giving a fuck
Young killers ain't remembering ya
Or respecting what you've done in them streets
They just focused on themselves coming up
Some pimping gorillas, some chimps some chump
Monkey shit in occasions of those not acting their ages
Got the story first half from my incarcerated Scarfaces
Speaking a coded language on visitation
In no form am I a criminal but never would show
What my friends was getting into
DVD title menu on the flat for four hours
Because I feel asleep beneath the sour
In the crib, yo bitch want me to take her like a shower
No one man should have all that...
