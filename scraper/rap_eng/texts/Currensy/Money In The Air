[Intro]
One time for my nigga 2 Chainz for throwing me that alley oop to
This weed is the one

[Hook]
Money in the air, watch it fall like rain
Get back on the grind we make it all again
Can't believe I'm doing this
Come in and see you in here
Money in the air, watch it fall like rain

[Verse 1]
Rolls Royce outside, cause I'm in the building
Drank again, twisted with my niggas
Hella stacks and bottles they bring that out quickly
I give that money to my bottom bitch and tell her pitch it
Sometimes I like to see it in the air
Cause I work hard enough to not care

[Hook]
Money in the air, watch it fall like rain
Money in the air, we watch it fall like rain
Get back on he grind we make it all again
Can't believe I'm doing this
Come in and see you in here
Money in the air, we let it fall like rain

[Verse 2]
It's like 4:15 in this bitch
T.Y. finna order some wings in this bitch
Five minutes before 4:20 we smoking out the onion
A couple more bottles of that Rose comin
Athletes in this muthafucka they throwin duckets
Street legends in this muthafucka throwin duckets

[Outro]
Money in the air we let it fall like rain
Get back on the grind we make it all again
Can't believe I'm doing this
Come in and see you in here
