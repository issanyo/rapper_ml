(Intro: Curren$y)
Live the life a nigga die for
Wish ya wife would be my side ho
Never seen a nigga fly where
Take a ride inside a 64
Hop out ask him what his info
He ain't tell ya but his bitch know
Getting to the figures that addition digits flipping triple tell him gimme mo'
Sent ya bitch to the corner store
Bag of chips and a 40 Row
They ain't mine but the chips is
Go give the beer to my big bro

(Verse 1: Mr. Marcelo)
House full of bitches, weed in the kitchen
Hell yea nigga we living
And all these bitches tryna get a real nigga even when a nigga ain't pitching
A real OG in my city lil nigga motherfucker better ask around
I always have been a standup guy so it ain't no backing down
I used to make (?), now I make (?)
Hustle all night, pray all day I'll sleep when I'm 6 feet deep
Pops used to sip Ol' E, moms sip Henn on the rocks
And I did coming up as a kid, was smoke big blunts like Ox
I used to have dreams like ML King, then I start acting like Malcolm X
I always did have a lot of money, I always did get a lot of respect
Debit, credit, cash, purp, kush, hash
Shit to real to be standing still so OG's be chasing bags

(Chorus: Curren$y)
All them bitches insane, all them bitches insane
All my whips is insane, yea, yea
All them niggas is lame, diamonds all in my chain
Hoes just after my fame, yea, yea
All them bitches the same, all them bitches the same
All my whips is the same, Diamonds all in my chain
All them niggas is lame, that money just ain't a thang
Them bitches just after my fame

(Verse 2: T.Y.)
Look, I told that bitch, don't be catching feelings and shit
Right after I hit, I'm mashing off in that new Benz
Motherfuck them tints, want you to see me and my friends
When we steerin the Bent, ain't gon kill you with a ratchet
But with the way I live, yea
She gon shake that for some tips
But I'm not gon give a shit
I'm gon spend that on some rims
Stomp a nigga in some Timbs
Just because they want pretend
Like they gangsters but they really pussy boy your sister told me what it is
Wake up and I grind for breakfast
I stunt so hard that I can not help it
Yea that Jet Life I'm gon rep it
All these bitches the same, I just gotta accept it
Don't slam my door when you ride with me ho
Yea, you cross the line and I come for your throat

(Chorus: Curren$y)
All them bitches insane, all them bitches the same
All my whips is insane, yea, yea
All them niggas is lame, diamonds all in my chain
Hoes just after my fame, yea, yea
All them bitches the same, all them bitches the same
All my whips is the same, Diamonds all in my chain
All them niggas is lame, that money just ain't a thang
Them bitches just after my fame
