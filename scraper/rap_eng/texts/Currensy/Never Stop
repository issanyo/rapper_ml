Yeah
Yeah yeah
Damn
Pray it never stops
Yeah
Huh

[Chorus](x2)
Cold champagne pop, gold chain full of rocks
Rubber band money knots, pray it never stop
We stay on the money route, got the hardest Chevy's out
We was ready, they was not, pray it never stop

[Verse 1]
Watching Bel Air in my house
Bitches naked on the couch
Moonwalking, Gucci socks, tell my woman get a watch
Bust down 'cause it's hot so I brought the ice out
Imma cool on the block, cruise when my top drop
Bullshit we will stop but I know it's not
Your new shit just flopped so you going pop
Underground never let me down that's all I got
So if I never said thanks let me say thank you now

[Chorus]
Cold champagne pop, gold chain full of rocks
Rubber band money knots, pray it never stop
We stay on the money route, got the hardest Chevy's out
We was ready, they was not, pray it never stop

[Bridge]
Watching Bel Air in my house
Bitches naked on my couch
Moonwalking, Gucci socks, I tell my woman get a watch
Cold champagne pop, gold chain full of rocks
Rubber band money knots pray it never stop

[Verse 2]
Didn't do it by myself I did it with my time
Now I got the clearest diamond in my Rollie crown
Three cubes of ice in a glass of brown
Let the class begin, Spitta on smash again
To live flashing this you gotta really want it
If you gonna strike it rich
My pinky ring dripping honey on a bitch
Spitta looking like money anywhere I am
20 freaks on hand, brung the beach to the sand
Imma reach in the pan, pull out enough pieces
Just to feed the whole fam with the aw man
Whole block say you hot been running your mouth
Shooters circling your house you scared to come out
You don't wanna be the one that the news about
Meanwhile I'm on the lot checking coupes out
Finna test drive see how much the coupe got
I love that, I'm about to pull the loot out

[Chorus]
Cold champagne pop, gold chain full of rocks
Rubber band money knots, pray it never stop
We stay on the money route, got the hardest Chevy's out
We was ready, they was not, pray it never stop
Watching Bel Air in my house
Bitches naked on the couch
Moonwalking, Gucci socks, tell my woman get a watch
Cold champagne pop, gold chain full of rocks
Rubber band money knots, pray it never stop
