My bad
Fuck it
Yeah
Shit we go through trying to put these tapes out
Yeah
Where haven't we been yet
Welcome to the winner's circle nigga

You better check yourself before you wreck yourself
The hate champagne could be bad for your health
You will wanna keep them negative remarks to yourself
FS Jets and we live top shelf
Just closed a closing deal out west
Fly Society and crew connect
Me and TK shot a video fresh
With H.I.T. from the Long Beach set
Nigga New Orleans everday I rep
Cause they show love when I did it myself
Mixtape after mixtape, I'm just
Really getting started brother
You just started something sucker
(?)
I laugh at niggas who try to mimic my image
Too iced to be hot son, I'm chilling
(?) bad I kill it
Rap styles I change 'em up fast
The style you got now, the style I already had
That shit funny to me
Your kids wanna be X-Men for Halloween
You wanna be me, Spitta
Yeah
