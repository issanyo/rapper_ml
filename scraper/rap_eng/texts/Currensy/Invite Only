[Verse 1]
Ok they don’t want it they one hundred we one million
Got it I flaunt it, not crazy just passion
All apart of God’s planning preordained from the jump and I promise to never lose it
Pick your poison paper hungry like Pookie how I need it give me my money it just keep callin
Bitches hoeing on my homies tryin to get me to beat it
Never knowing that the plan was to pass 'em like back then
FaceTime shorty call it how I see it
Ever since mama said the street lights we had to beat them
This shit is fire like that light switch laced to your backside
This got me feeling like that time I got my first kiss, Recess shorty Allenwood Elementary
Truth or dare I need the cutest girl to put these lips on and luckily I was the cutest guy it won't no problem
I wonder if she knew that boy grew up to had to act right
I wonder if she knew that boy grew up to live that rap life
Ain’t as rich as I wanna and can still loan her something
Ain't these bitches for everybody that be on to something
Ain't everybody that’s onto something live a lonely struggle

[Hook]
It’s just me and my homies, invite only
We don’t need your input shorty
We want money, we don’t want fame
I don’t need your outlook on me
I’m just living no sideline watching
I’m just pimpin while my side bitch watching
God bless the real, death to all the phonies
It’s my party invite only

[Verse 2]
Pardon me partner I’m too busy staying polished
Meanwhile my conscious tellin me I’m too modest
I let you niggas think that I was slippin cause of the singing and positivity
Well that ain’t right
See I’m still that same mamma fucker that will have your baby mama sending confirmation numbers for them flights
See yall do it on say and we do it on sight
And we in it for life then yall in it for likes
That’s why I’m in it for keeps and yall barely keeping up
I should put yall on my will most yall niggas is my kids
Wonder how your daddy feel to know his baby boy ain’t his
Wonder why yo mom ain’t tell him what it was from the beginning
So it’s back to the cheese like wipe that smile off yo face
And all I want is my credit when it comes to Father’s Day
So you can hop off my meat land on another wave
We never playing it safe when we know that Jesus can save us
‘Til then...

[Hook]
It’s just me and my homies, invite only
We don’t need your input shorty
We want money, we don’t want fame
I don’t need your outlook on me
I’m just living no sideline watching
I’m just pimpin while my side bitch watching
God bless the real, death to all the phonies
It’s my party invite only

[Curren$y’s Verse]
Three ounces in the ziplock
This underground hip hop
Bought the Ferrari drizzop the city’s streets is hizzot
The A/C on full blast chillin as I roll pass
Only dope we slang as long as supplies last
Though I never run out we got stacks to gain
All the antics and thangs and gun cabinets they hang
In case you try to bring it and assuming we can’t hang
We assemble quickly dismantle your whole gang
Proceed to board the plane the pilot’s my main man
So it’s nothing to us living like the Gold Rush
I once rode the bus but now I drive a Rolls
Pull up to my tour bus pick up bags on a roll
What you know bout slangin your lyrics like dope
Real shit they pay me for so you never see me broke
Understand what you niggas getting a little culture from two of coldest living

[Hook]
It’s just me and my homies, invite only
We don’t need you input shorty
We want money, we don’t want fame
I don’t need your outlook on me
I’m just living no sideline watching
I’m just pimpin while my side bitch watching
God bless the real, death to all the phonies
It’s my party invite only
