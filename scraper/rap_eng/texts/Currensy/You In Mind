Haters gon slit your wrist

Uh, Me and my nigga buying houses
When we used to go in half on ounces
Now we balling you don't hear those spaldings bouncing?
Globetrotting goyard luggage niggas got it
I been watching from my island they don't think I see em'
They copying our style then they tryna be us
While we rolling up that reefer chilling in arena
OG only and my vegetable steamers
You could soak your style in bleach, still won't come out cleaner

We turned it into real shit
Couple high ass niggas stacking millions

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Playing Pokemon Go me and your ho
Im catching something rare while she get something rolled
You know the code, always go for the gold
We came in and broke the mold
Could make a million with my eyes closed
I ride slow cause you never know
Police is out here bro, I check my traps and then I change clothes
Catch me anywhere my plane goes
And always rep for the jets and taylor gang we who the game chose
Im'a make sure that I got one rolled, but you gotta make sure that you got one for me
Baby girl it's all good you ain't gotta smoke
Just know you with a real nigga riding' with a G
And you can say you ain't high but you bout to be
Start off my day getting' dollars stay reppin' my gang I know that they proud of me
Hop in my ride and we'll run and get high
