[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Self made, Self paid
Shorty bought that Rolls Royce
Put it on blades
Shorty paid the cost she now in boss lane
Stayed down, got high and you never changed
SL with the top up when it's heavy rain
Have your name hold weight
Have you chain solid gold no fake
Destined to ball, it was written
This is fate
They can't interfere so I roll up let em hate

[Hook: Curren$y]
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing
I was born in New Orleans, live my whole life stunting
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing

[Verse 2: T.Y.]
Diamonds shining, fill my backwood with exotic
I'm the hottest topic
Pimp your bitch right out them dollars
I don't wear no Robins
Sweat pants is what I arrive in
Yeah I'm steady climbing
Swear I'm balling on these niggas
Without a fucking problem
You don't want to problem, so don't you try to stop em
JLR, Spitta told me get em I say I got em
Water whippin in the kitchen
That's how lil homie got em
Ranking so many bitches
I'm starting to think they plotting
I leave em with no watching
What you saying something?
Well make sure that I got it
Got to be a cold day in hell before I let em ride me
And all this ice around my neck
It's not that hard to find me, yeah

[Hook: Curren$y]
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing
I was born in New Orleans, live my whole life stunting
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing

[Verse 3: Corner Boy P]
Uh
Make it to spend it
Blew a lot, I stash plenty
Grill was 20, I smile at bitches and boot up niggas
I'm east side with it, my side ain't sweet
Lil boy's blinking
Slide for my niggas, they ride for me
Like I ride for Spitta
Yeah, if you ain't no that, you don't know a nigga
And you probably the type that will owe a nigga
Cuz if you did't know, then you will do better
Teach a mans how to fish and he will eat forever
Shit, keep our minds together we be rich forever
Bury me in all my jewelry let me shine forever
I got Ciroc and take a four on it
Let them niggas have the style since I got more coming
P

[Hook: Curren$y]
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing
I was born in New Orleans, live my whole life stunting
Money put away, I got some more coming
Never have to ask a man to let me hold nothing
If you don't know that about me then you don't know nothing
