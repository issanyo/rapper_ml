[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Life a movie, who directing yo shit?
That’s low budget, mine’s a Tarantino flick
Blockbuster, I do my own stunts in this bitch
Shout out to Stunna, New Orleans niggas up in this shit
No fronting, all my niggas really with it
Fool frontline hustling, rapping got me on the tube
My homies been on TV for that other shit
News at six, nigga, grizzly discovery
Body seen floating let the dive team recover it
They can’t release his name 'til they notify the family
While the killer getting dressed for the club like ain’t nothing happened

[Hook x3: Curren$y]
I grew up in this shit, stuck with this shit
You too pussy to fuck with this shit
But I’m in love with this shit

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
Aye, fuck a bitch, I’d rather keep a burner by my side
I’m from the south side, that’s just how we ride
My man got shot, that shit slowed him down
My nigga even turned Muslim, now he pray to Allah
My nigga don’t eat no pork but still smoke that pine
So every time he see me he like, light that fire
And meanwhile I’m tryna get us off this hot ass block
We just two peas in a pod trying to get a peace of mind
Bang, bang, that’s the shit I heard like all of the time
I’m talking every day, have fiends falling in line
Today could be my last day but that’s all part of the grind
But that ain’t part of my plan, I plan to stay on my job
I had to get it since I wasn’t born with it
I see the big pic, I’m thinking long-term nigga
But they had drugs in that bitch, I grew up on that shit
Guess I’m made for that shit, I got paid off that shit

[Hook x3: Curren$y]

[Verse 3: Freddie Gibbs]
Uh, yeah, yeah
I drive every car that you dream about
Hit every bitch that you wishing for, leave her leaking out
Fresh out of that place like they scared to see what they read about
It ain’t no sleep on Virginia Street when them geekers outside
Sidewalk serving the walking dead
Gotta meet me up the block cause my momma stay on my head
Telling me to go get a job but I’m chopping the rock instead
If I make it up to the top, will I pop and jump off the ledge?
Confessions of Gangsta Gibbs, nigga, thug life
I’d trade this shit for wife and kids, nigga
Real nigga, fuck surviving, I wanna live, nigga
Act a fool, I make him go night-night
And catch a flight to Chi, blow some dope with my nigga Mike Mike
Bitch, I’m stuck in this shit, a million dollars up in this bitch
I made my name stay in them cluckers and shit
And, yeah, the streets of Gary raised me, but the West Coast paid me
You pussy niggas get home safely

[Outro: The Godfather]
Michael Corleone: They want to have a meeting with me, right? Let’s set the meeting. Get our informants to find out where it’s going to be held. They’re going to search me when I first meet them, right? So I can’t have a weapon on me then. But if Clemenza can figure a way to have a weapon planted there for me, then I’ll kill them both
