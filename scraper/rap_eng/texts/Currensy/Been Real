[Intro]
Landed with my duffle in hand
Working out a plan
Hustle not a scam
Struggle of a man
Tryna get to it
Southern supplier of real music
Trill shit evokeâ€¦

[Verse 1]
Landed with my duffle in my hand
Working out a plan
A hustle not a scam
This the struggle of a man tryna get to it
Southern supplier of real music
Trill shit evoke feeling when you listen to it
Only trueness if ever I spoke
It was a million dollar quote if ever I wrote
Papered up, but i'm still feeling broke
Ran a 100 miles still got plenty more to go
Terrace overlooking the seashore
Left side of my walk-in closet look like the BBC store
Lifestyle goals, this is something you should reach for
High as the stars because we on my nigga
Drug dealer cars we gettin' country club homes we living
Looking like a PGA champion
Crib liad out, I'm stoned in the governor's mansion
Tryna put a little dope in the game
Put some pure in your veins
Help you maintain and stay sane
Sharpen your knives and carve your own lane
Never let that money make you change
A gangster gets his money and remains

[Hook]
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
You don't know how that shit feel
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
That ain't how you niggas live
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
You don't know how this shit
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
That ain't how you niggas live

[Verse 2]
Outside the chicken spot in that Starship Rolls
With the kamikaze doors
Discussin the hard from the last score
As the world revolves slow
We livin fast, runnin through that cash
Cause any minute can be our last
So we live it up, pop a bottle lift your glass
This is us, the team that never switched up
To the script, memorized that bitch
Y'all was tryna be too slick
You end up lying in shit
See this a doggy dog world
You get fleas you get bit
Tryna live free in the streets, might get hit
This is for those who wanna thrive, not just exist
To survive and surpass all the shit
Ferraris and a bad bitch, pillow-top mattress
Daydreamin 'bout paper advancement
Gettin up, gettin to it, really puttin the plan in action
The result is the boss smokin gas, mashin
On the interstate blazin' reminiscin laughin
Smilin at all memories, even the bad ones
Cause at least we had 'em
Some of us made it, some of us immortalized in murals
Lookin to the pavement
Candles in the spot homie was slayed in
I shed a tear with my top down it was raining

[Hook]
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
You don't know how that shit feel
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
That ain't how you niggas live
I ain't always had that paper but I been real
You don't know how this shit feel
That ain't how you niggas live
