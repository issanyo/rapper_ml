[Chorus: Caskey & ClicKlak]
Rotatin', go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Kush clouds comin' out my mouth, it's in rotation
Aye, go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Bendin' corners in the old school, steerin', we in rotation
Aye, go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Tell the DJ gotta keep the song here in rotation

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Money over bitches, millions in the ceilin'
Pretty sleepin' beneath 'em, dreamin' 'bout a G
She never thought she'd be with, Jet Life, on sight
Mama, I know you see it, outsiders in them low riders
Finna take it, we ain't waitin' on nobody
Smoke the half 'fore the plane landed
Killin' shit, homeboy, you caught me red-handed
In the middle of this, all the old drug deals
Done out the brightness of the sun where the busters don't run
Cops don't come, they scared they'll get killed
Understand, I'm the one, rolex heavy
Burnin' gas like my '64 chevy
Plottin' how to get richer than
We became off the last heist, so tonight, we strike again
And repeat 'til we all sittin' on millions
Try to live the life that done killed me

[Verse 2: ClicKlak]
Bucket seats, four cheeks in 'em
Few thousand in my denim, my shirt made of fine linen
Your thread count don't amount to my paper chase
I got hoes that bless me, amazin' grace
I'm a pimp for real, I done seen too much
Bitches shootin' up heroin, swear they hooked to the boy
I got bricks in the caravan, I could cook for your boy
My first felony charge, I knew my life would be hard
I hit the hustlin', musclin', sellin' drugs to the customers
They weren't workin' too much for us, let me tell you my pimpin'
You see the fires that I'm given, put your heart in the prison
I ain't lettin' you out, you said you ridin' or dyin'
You let them

[Verse 3: Caskey]
Words out your mouth, f-f-fuck you and your gossip
You come around my clique talkin' shit, we in your wallets
It's Keep Pushin', dog, we the squad and with the pilots
The indo we got, it ain't just green, it's ultraviolet
I'm dinnin' in the kitchens of hell, still I prevail
I could make a castle out of sand stuck in a bale
I could puzzle with the strings of the universe, I'm too diverse
We possibly just the best out and you the worst
Swear we sold more pills than half of these rappers
A lot of bitches say they gettin' to the dough
But how many of 'em actually stackers?
What you get when you spell faculty backwards?
Nothin', imitators and actors

[Chorus: Caskey & ClicKlak]
We busy rotatin', go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Kush clouds comin' out my mouth, it's in rotation
Aye, go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Bendin' corners in the old school, steerin', we in rotation
Aye, go DJ
All these hoes around me, man, I swear they just in rotation
Rotation
Tell the DJ gotta keep the song here in rotation

[Outro: ClicKlak]
Yeah, y'all already know what time it is
Aye, this, this pimpin' in the flesh
You know what I'm sayin'?
Aye, one thing I always was taught;
You must keep all things in rotation
If you keep everything spinnin' like the Earth
Can't nobody take you away
So it's like you the only one who could circle
I keep tellin' these niggas, man
Stop investin' all your time in these females
These broads, these bitches
Whatever you may name these hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
You invest your money and your time into these hoes
You know what you end up with?
Nothin' and a nigga like me puttin' that hoe in rotation
Ha, now come join this council, baby
You know what time it is
