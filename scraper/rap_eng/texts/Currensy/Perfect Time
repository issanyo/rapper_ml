[Verse 1: Curren$y]
From The City That Care Forgot
From the section where rations had to be airdropped
Was undetected but they know I'm here now
Rapping through my Verizon network you niggas hear me now good
I'm in VA with my big homie twisting backwoods
Usually I don't get down like that
But that's my big dog, I hit a few times out of respect
And now I'm on the jet full of trees watching videos
Laughing at studio gangsters they more Gents then G's
My bitches use your mixtape cover to break they trees on
Bape top of the building, villa, gorilla King Kong
Thrilla Manilla Spitta get his King of the Ring on
Deals back and forth on the table that's label ping-pong
Won't get caught up in it, that sucker shit
Nothing positive would ever come from it
I'll buy this shit entirely from the hip-hop government

[Hook]
And fools know I
Never sell my soul, swear on both eyes
Never change in attempt to gain dollar signs
I just kept it G and waited on the perfect time
Go left if the situation ain't right
Only thing I got if you're asking for advice
The moves I done made in my life was difficult
But if I had two I would do it twice

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Buzz increased until it became a bang
Jet planes in the building bitch we do our thang
Lace locks on my Fire Red 5's
Walk in the club with gangsters who amazed to still be alive
Cause they been through it but I took them out it
When I put my heart into this music I got some money out it
From East 34th to JFK by helicopter
I'm in the magazines you're in barbershops reading about me
And I know your girl made you more mad
When she picked you up from work she had that How Fly on full blast
Just another shot from the extended clip of Jet Shit
And another one coming before you even know you're hit
These bitches is becking by the smell of the Jet piff
These niggas is jealous of the love the JETS get
But I ain't stressing, mama roll up the whole zip
And let me smoke away all this industry bullshit

[Hook]

[Outro]
Never changed it for nothing
Sports cars, sexy broads and luggage
Better to be somebody for one day
Than a nobody for your whole life
Fuck it...
