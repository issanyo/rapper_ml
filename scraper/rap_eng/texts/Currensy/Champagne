[Hook: Fiend]
Young Fiend
Turnin' lanes
Everybody wanna know
What you burnin' mane
Champagne
Champagne, Champagne, Champagne
Spaceship bitches know my name
Everybody wanna know how you earned that change
Champagne
Champagne, Champagne, Champagne

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Flotation device
Baby this Impala ride nice
She pay me for one-up a lil life (?)
A lil excitement
A lot of doobie lighting
Crack the windows
We fuck to the thunder and the lightning
The neighbors hear her screaming
Tell the world how much she like it
Oatmeal seats
Blueberry Piping
Stumbling out the club
Way too drunk
I had to let my bitch drive it
I sit
With half-closed eyelids
Still twisting up
On my 'We Never Die' shit
The fuck you thought?
Want the best?
Tell the plug man
Give you some of what I just bought nigga
Jets!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fiend]
I'm a pursuer for Von's gourmet (?)
Incomings off the four-way
She was naked 'fore she hit the doorway
I know they
Hear us from Pigeontown
To Norway
Alien weed
Strain names Gourney (?)
Grind up
Roll up
Roll out
Uptown through the South
Tell me what you know 'bout
Head anywhere
Don't necessarily mean you go out
Text us on the place (?)
You might see the 44's out
Monte Carlo's colors of ravens mane
Avoid trash tree fuck with your people's mane
City to City cross seas to continents
International Jones be on the bombest shit

[Hook]
