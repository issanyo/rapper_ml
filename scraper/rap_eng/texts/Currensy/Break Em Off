Hustlers, ballers, gangstas, catepillars
All of them real niggas fuck with Spitta
Every weekend bring them cars out in my city
A bad bitch in my Bentley with her tities sitting pretty
Ain't no mystery
We finna' get lit up like a Christmas tree
Evergreen plotting with my team on the dark screen
Never seen a nigga this G until you met me
Lil Snupe RIP I still can't let it be
Letting off steam spitting keys for the triple beam
That's what I call a mic we selling dope all night
What I [?] high street price like a brick of soft white
Bottles on nice put the models on flights
Maserati we be riding dirty in the future sprite
Maneuvers for that money out there in the moonlight
Paper coming sooner than we can make room for it
Stash house plus still gotta add rooms to it
Nigga
La da da da da
Don't make me break you off something
Won't nobody say they saw nothing
Ride by like a drive by 300 thousand dollar cars coming
La da da da da
