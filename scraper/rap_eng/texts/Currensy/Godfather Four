[Intro: Curren$y]
(Fatality, fatality)
Drive-In Theatre

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Before the curtain drum, we was getting it on
'til day turn dark and dusk becomes dawn
Wiping my cars off, putting my jewels on
My pinkie ring show and prove who's the true Don
We making moves that make the news
They tryna make movies about it, but we ain't even stop yet
This hustle still in progress due to do process
Coupes like jets, fly through sets
Bulging pockets on my sweats from collecting side bets
Nigga I rap like I can't drive, ho, so buckle your belts
Technology stealth, quality reputation intact
Cause I kept it so trill with myself
And the streets never fronted, everything one hunnit
A couple haters hating but fuck it you gotta love it
Make sure all the bases covered, every slice of bread buttered
Keep the safe flooded, easy bake oven, cakes coming
Pretty bitch who know what's up but won't say nothing
Keep the boat afloat, loose lips
Get your feet tied to the bricks, facetime with the fish
This is Godfather 4, shit sick like swine flu
Sore throat, runny eyes, bloody nose
Coke loads tossed from the boat
Frog man bring it in, operation battle toad
Code name, cold game, Coltrane in my Ghost, let me roll

[Hook]
Godfather 4, Godfather 4
Godfather 4, Godfather 4
Ceiling solid gold, Italian marble floors
Godfather 4, Godfather 4
Godfather 4, Godfather 4
Godfather 4, Godfather 4
The topic major dough behind closed doors
Suckas will never know, Godfather 4

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yeah, it's me, 2 tons of copper wire from construction sites
A rack of minks, pure gold Iraqi links
Angled in my taco meat, I bought my son's team
Soccer cleats, elevated visions from the chopper seat
Rims spin just like spaghetti on the pasta fork
Billy Crystal kissed my cheek before the Oscars
He said "It was my pleasure," I said "Don't touch my leather"
Then I hopped a flight to Denver, later that night
They taking pictures from the van outside the carnival
See me doing business with the manager of Arsenal
The goalie's fingers in the box with the cannolis
It's Christmas time, I bought the Kobes for the little homies
Pictures with the jockey in the winners circle
Triple crown on, all brown on
Suddenly my frown's gone, Dog Pound Don
Quarter-pounder with no sound on, cleaner than Calgon
Ah man, Godfather 4, Godfather 4
Johnny gotta go, Johnny gotta go
Fly Larry in at 2 and then he's gone by 4
Cause Johnny's gotta go, it's Godfather 4
