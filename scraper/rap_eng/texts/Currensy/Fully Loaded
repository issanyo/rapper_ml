[Intro]
I been smoking up, fully loaded
Ohhh-Ohhh yea
I been smoking up, fully loaded

Verse 1:
From the Bentley to the booth, now I'm back again
Because this shit take ends, im try'na win
Losers is them, we ranked top ten that
Any event championship air bagging, the E-class station wagon
VIP the homie threw me down, BVS 17's
Im lookin' clean, coming down fucking them up
Spinning they heads round, yea bruh that's us

Hook: (x3)
Loaded (Loaded)
I've been drinking (I've been drinking)
I've been smoking
I'm fully loaded (Loaded)

Verse 2:
Bottom bread, fuck what they said
Thin crust, extra cheese, papered up
My bottom bitch learning to water ski, so raise a glass for her
Cheers to the self made, self paid
Haters ain't shit, Family's everything
Everybody's rich no weak link
Weigh my chain on the dope scale, in the wind like boat sails, Mermaids learn by the smoke smell

Loaded (Loaded)
We over here girl

[Hook]

Verse 3:
Uh, Ideas in the ashtray
Could've been the next big thing if developed halfway
But in the streets living savagely, Got caught up sadly
Coughin' it up, bleeding badly, we lost 'em bruh
All I could do is dedicate my next player move to you
So just know who was fo' when I slide through
Frame on the [?]oldest, cruise life i choose
I'm on, I'm on more than Sport Center
I'm on like porch lights, Daddy home bitches

[Hook]
