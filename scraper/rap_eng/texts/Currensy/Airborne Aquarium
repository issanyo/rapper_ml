Haha, yeauh
Lames catch feelings we catch flights, Jet Life, fool
Turn it up some
Lames catch feelings we catch flights, Jet Life
Yeauh, eauh

[Verse:]
I’m getting hella mail from jail, niggas telling me to kill it
When they get out I’ll bring them ’round some bitches
Shinobi how I kick it, American Ninja, major motion picture
Flipping my remote, same way I do them hoes
But she already know before she touch my Chevy door
Real nigga, let me make it as clear as my windows
No square shall enter in the circle of winners
Know I’m prepared for whatever, if you know what I been through
Rearview, Clear vision, memories of paid dues
Confined to a runway, thunderstorms came thru
But look what it came to, something that amazes you
Soon as you quit hating and hear what I gotta say to you
Baby blue sole. These white 11, ’96
No retro card came with this
Same year, my Impala with the floor shift
4-door suicide, Muscle car chauffeured
Shawty body choco-latte; Russell Stovers
Brung weed with her whenever I invite her over
Polo sweater, Teddy bear hanging off her shoulder
No care, over here, so we put it in the air
Walking ’round my house, say she wanna fuck everywhere
That’s cool baby, but I just got that pool table
We ain’t gotta stay away from it, It’s all good
If you wanna get under it, then I guess I can fuck with it
Before I got on this beat, it made out a bucket-list
In these bars, I granted its deathwish
Legendary lay-up. Jordan with the right-left switch
Hang time, Hand glide, Stir fried, Chanky-eyed, Shanghai
Candy rain, drizzle frame, I ride
’87 Corvette ZR1, took the T-tops off it
Put ‘em in the trunk bitch, all gassed up, she been drinkin’ from the pump
That’s all bad, tryna pass, fucked around and crashed
Bitches all flip, Fools tryna make it last
Emotional luggage, nothing of it, I don’t check bags
I just carry-on, leave that bullshit in the past
Half Rose, Chandon, OJ in my glass
Mimosa, Testarossa program, Countach curriculum
Doors open like a pendulum swinging
Rock in my Jetset Emblem
Fool, it’s the serve, like Wimbledon, interior cinnamon
The car that I’m sittin’ in, Calm my bad nerves, I call her my Ritalin
Just kiddin, not pillin’, just element twistin’
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin
Not pillin’, just element twistin’
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin
From the Earth come the fire and the wind I’m livin
Yeauhh
