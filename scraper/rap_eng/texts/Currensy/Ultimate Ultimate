[Intro: Curren$y]
Yeah
Yeah
La da da da da
I ended up talkin to the homie too
Good lookin out
Uh

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Rolls Royce, paper plates, no tint
Fish bowl pull it up like a YouTube video (Skurrrrr)
Look it up, views up, take a pole
How many of them other niggas this cold?
Wrist cold, But its nothin new
I roll a custom to stuntin on suckas thats what I do
For the last few days bettin money on games
Side bettin on Madden, breakin cash in
Rollin fat ones and not passin
Pedal mashin a classic blast from the past
Hella fasted the old dash in the flash
Smokin on that only grown that
Oh its strictly location where them suckas never throw at
New Orleans born with homes all over the map
Call them hoes over we fuck in an hour flat
I got a roll, dice roll
I chose to show up on television with my eyes low
Cause I figured, fuck it homie they already know
Everywhere I go this is so
And I'm freshed like these bapes were just baked wheres the stove
I got a cook to scrap the plate, They want more
They all dope
And its all in the floor
Money all in the wall all in the floor
With your wildest dreams behind my garage doors
We are the audio Narcos
Cocaine in the AUX cords we drug lords
Take the party outdoors
Dock the yacht, and start the sports cars
This is what I grind for
Flash back my apartment
Burn holes in my dirty carpet
Whole time with my mind on boss shit
Plot on it till its accomplished
Large amounts of accountants countin commas
Schemas countin, Suckas not around us
Fuck a scoundrel leave them niggas where you find them
Designer imposter pretending to be mobsters
They are not monsters, Boogieman neither
I'm highed up and I'm bothered
Sucka free, this is me, a capital G
Everyday, all day, highed up with in the morning the homie Sway
Yeah

[Outro]
Ultimate Ultimate Ultimate Ultimate
