[Bridge: Curren$y]
Outside leanin' on the homie's cutlass
Burning a lil somethin'
Talking bout a lil somethin'
Finna come up big on 'em

[Hook]
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up big on 'em
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up big on em
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up
Lil somethin', talking 'bout a lil somethin'
But we finna' come up

[Verse 1]
I got dope in my rhymes I sell dope
Get in my car ride around turn heads everywhere I go
Smellin' like a whole pound thats just a roach
She wanna sit in my glass house and roll up the smoke
I get around the building "quit rolling stoned"
I got your girl at my smash spot but not at my home
I smarter than that, baby I'm too cold
I could sell a Polar bear a coat
'96 Impala like a boat
Fill out that motherfucker float
Them bitches say I do the most
But I know I can always do more

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2]
Me and my niggas took an oath
Never again being broke
I get it crackin' like jokes
My cousin 'lac on spokes
Daytons and Zeniths thatâ€™s how we roll
Daily I'm living by the code
My brother snuck in the back door, something serious
God forbid he let it go, while we in here
Every day and they didn't know that's how it's been
Since I was nothing years old I remember
When the G's spoke I was all ears
Now I'm draped in all gold when they see me
