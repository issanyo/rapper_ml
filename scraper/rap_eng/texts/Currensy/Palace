(Hook)
I live in the palace and smoke on ‘em gasses
My cars is all classics and fast as the flash is
Behind the back passes

(Verse)
Assisting these tracks and
Makin’ em sound more elaborate
Which is pretty much magic, cuz this one was already nasty
Notice that I have outlasted a couple of folks in my class, but
I do more smokin’ then braggin’
Them low riders draggin’, muscle cars mashin’, luxury wagons
Stuff ‘em with duffels, we travellin’
Bitches in love with the fashion, I’m the king of the high and chillin’
Some rappers dress like Aladdin
I ride like a drug dealin’ mechanic
Got Cuban links on the Dickies
Short sleeve with a thermal underneath
With a Rolex, normally
Playin Jane on masterpiece
Just dependin’ how mad I be
With these niggas might drop free dope for a week
Bitches throw they best friend to the sharks just to eat wicha
I see it every week-end so it don’t mean shit
These hoes supposed to be sisters
Now they both naked in this muthafucka
And they touchin’ all one anotha
Want pictures, I’mma hold the camera for ‘em
Send em to my homie, now they dancin’ for em
Musta done they thang, cuz they be askin’ for em
And I’m like hey, you can have em homie
They be with a nigga but I don’t own her
I’m not one of them niggas that be payn for it
I’m not one of them niggas that be beggin’ for it
I’m not one of them niggas that be waitin’ for it
Cuz that hustle in me got them bitches on me
Cuz that hustle in me make them bitches want me
Got them bitches actin thirsty, and hungry
Leave em starvin’ for a nigga that be ballin’

(Hook)
I live in the palace and smoke on ‘em gasses
My cars are all classic and fast is the flashes
Behind the back passes yo bitch made advances
She work me in traffic, her tounge could do backflips
Hey!
