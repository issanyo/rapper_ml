Yeah
Yeah
On a mission and I'm fishin' for my niggas
Fuck around found Pilot Talk III


Million cash in the safe, help me sleep safe
Handcuff my favourite bitch to the briefcase
Baby text me, let me know you made it in safe
Condo, capital city of each state
Enough here for all of us to have a slice of cake
Make sure every body ate, the whole family straight
Try to keep a tidy place and have it free of snakes
Cause you know they slither in here some kinda way
Some disguised as friends, masks on they face
Fake smiles, devilish grins, looks of hate
Steer clear of them cause them niggas they'll take ya
For a long ride, they find ya tied up off the interstate
Stakes high, but Iâ€™m higher
Keys open doors to my lowrider
Somewhere inside I'm sure I got a lighter
Take flight after we find it
Racecar driver slash airplane pilot
Dress better than yo stylist nigga I'm not even tryin'
You wastin' time lookin' at shit you ain't even buyin'
I'm on the lot and you barely online browsin'
Tryna tell me what to do with my shit
Organized crime, in my mind game applied
Dream realized, things visualized, materialized
Words to my rhymes, I'm swervin' in my '65
13 inch gold spokes white wall tires
Young'un you 'round grown folks
Keep some open eyes, and ears
You might learn something up here
No fear, just blood sweat and gears
Shifting the number one position, top tier
For the right amount of dollars my nigga, I'll appear
The whole crowd high off the dope for they ears
Catalogue thats enough dope for the years
I'm on for hella seasons like cheers nigga yeah
Million cash in the safe, help me sleep safe
Handcuff my favourite bitch to the briefcase
Baby text me, let me know you made it in safe
Condo, capital city of each state
Enough here for all of us to have a slice of cake
Make sure every body ate, the whole family straight
Try to keep a tidy place and have it free of snakes
Cause you know they slither in here some kinda way


On a mission and I'm fishin' for my niggas
Fuck around found Pilot Talk
Yeah, yeah
Seen niggas blow up and blow it, you know it
One of the last stoned poets
