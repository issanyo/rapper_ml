(Chorus)
Exotics and low riders front my house I dreamed about it
Now all I do walk out my front door and I see I got it
I used to dream about it, I can't believe I got it
I guess all I'm saying anybody could be somebody

(Verse 1)
They counted me out, I counted up, I counter punch
Upper cut, out the blue fucked em up
Copped a new coupe, so I could pull up on a bitch and tell her that we through
I thought you knew, ran into one thats way realer than you
Now watch me move, only money will I pursue
Oh I done paid dues, so much I probably paid for you
I ain't tripping its cool, my young bitch said I'm dripping
She wipe the sauce off my shoes
I'm in the trap kitchen smoked out in this vocal booth
They ain't want see me winning them haters turned off they tunes
Bigger than television bitch the underground rules
And now they see I did it on any level
Rolex bezel Ferraris and better
Yeah, Yeah

(Chorus)
Exotics and low riders front my house I dreamed about it
Now I walk out my front door and then I can see I got it
I used to dream about it, I can't believe I got it
I guess all I'm saying anybody could be somebody

(Outro)
Exotics and low riders front my house I dreamed about it
Oh Lord now I walk out my front door and I see I got it
I used to dream about it, I can't believe I got it
I used to dream about it, I can't believe, I can't believe
I used to dream about it, now all I do walk out my front door and I see I got it
I used to dream about it, I can't believe I got it
I guess all I'm saying anybody could
I guess all I'm saying anybody could
I guess all I'm saying anybody could
Anybody
