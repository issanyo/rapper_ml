[Hook]
His and her Ferraris
She was there when I started
Rolled with me when I wasn't sure where I was going

[Verse 1]
Saw a king in me, knew my crown was comin'
Carry me like royalty, back when I had nothing
Now niggas stuntin' and them angry fuckers grumpy
She be wanting to spend our bread to get them niggas whacked for me
I ain't trippin' off them simpletons, honey
I think that's funny
How your partners go to plottin'
And then they be wantin' to pop you
I keep my circle tight
Earth, wind, fire
My bitch, my weed, my lighter
Nightrider, driving
Music at a cool volume
I don't think the moon higher
Than us
If you ain't past the stars, then you right by one
Got a fresh, party to death
Jet Life and it's the set, married to the mob
25,000 dollars, baby, that's not no dress
That's a gown
Look good on you, but it look way better on the ground

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
His and her Ferraris
She was there when I started
Never questioned me steppin' in, four in the mornin'
Respected my hustle
Know to get it, had to be gone
Wasn't right, how I left her lonely
But this how it is, baby girl
When you choose a man that's hungry
Common sense to want somebody that want some shit
I want all of this
Whatever comin' to me and whatever they was gonna get
If they hatin' on me, fuck them niggas
That's just how I feel
Smokin' that fully automatic with no safety on it, chill
Dangerous OG, medical label only, for real
Dress sharply like the tail of Tate Razor's army
Made the papers all about how I make papers, homie
A couple of ladies
I'm kind of a player, don't let that phase you
Roll another one
When we land, we'll be in Las Vegas
Call your homegirls, tell 'em you made it
Fuck that
Fly your homegirls in, tell 'em you major
We made it

[Hook]
