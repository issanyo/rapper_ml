[Verse 1]
Canal street confidential
Information in these files will probably kill you
Guard it with your life
This shit I'm giving you, super pure snow white
Step on it more than twice, it'll still come out right
We sling it every night
ITunes never closes
Move in unison, four in the morning
Fuck is you doing? Hating instead of going for it
Mad at the player, throwing rocks at the scoreboard
Oh boy, I'm in my new toy
With my new bitch, we smoking hella noise
Oh, that's that loud shit
I always gas it out, come through, mafia
Make my profits rise, you can't stop these guys
Being red lights barricades a yield sign
Run through that wack ass defensive line
Then get mine, add that paper up
Subtract the suckers, then we split the pie
Corporation never die, alright

[Hook]
In that Porsche looking like I play sports
In that Lamb bitches saying that I'm the man
In that Bentley looking like heaven sent me
Ferrari horses building castles in the sand
Uh, I do it for my city cause i love them
I stunted on you bitch before i fucked her
Looking for the plug, you ain't know i was one
I'm the coldest motherfucker rap hustling

[Verse 2]
My OG gave me this golf hat
I'm posted up not too far from where he bought that
I came threw clowning i know you saw that
With my rags out back and my baseball cap
Back yard where my swimming pool and dogs at
Patio furniture, I'm taking weed naps
Big money dice game, in the bizzzack of the huzzzap
I'm in ever corner rizzzaps
Rep the set throw up, Jets I know you see that
Gathering stack, we touring the mizap
Champagne came with the game
Along with the bitches, they attracted to the fame
Like moths drawn to the flame, can't even blame
Human nature is the pursuit of paper
They know my name, they know it mean money
Free C Murda, sincerely yours, see money

[Hook]
I'm in that Porsche looking like i play sports
In that Lamb bitches saying that I'm the man
In that Bentley looking like heaven sent me
Ferrari horses building castles in the sand
Uh, I do it for my city cause i love them
I stunted on you bitch before i fucked her
Looking for the plug, you ain't know i was one
I'm the coldest motherfucker rap hustling

[Outro]
I stunted on your bitch before i fucked her (x9)
