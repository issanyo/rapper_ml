[Intro]
‘Fore I left up my house
I kill it while I’m on the
Ehm, life
Fuck are you takin’ me for?
One of you sucker niggas who forget the set when he blow
Thou shalt not rest until I make my whole fam rich

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh, my shift on the flo
My top in the trunk homie, my phone in the dunk
Finishin’ up a jurnt, had it almost rolled
‘Fore I left out my house, I kill it while I’m on the road
On the way to your girl house, you don’t know that’s mine
Smashed out at my homie crib, as far as it goes
Snatch the shower, change clothes, back to the same old
Triple OG Gang, the furry kangol
Keeping everything the same , word to what I drove
Double S Impala bubble on the stock chromes
Opportunity came knockin’ but I wasn’t home
I was at opportunity house, takin’ the valuables out
Like fuck that, we want it now
This is jet life, my niggas is buying stocks
Like fuck that, we want it now
This is jet life, my god sons want drops

[Hook]
The fuck you thought this was dawg?
We them illest motherfuckers after all
We’ll have this whole world changed by tomorrow
J.L.R

Like the fuck you thought this was dawg?
We them endless motherfuckers after all
We’ll have this whole world changed by tomorrow
J.L.R

[Verse 2: Young Roddy]
J.L.R
Aye what they thought this was dawg?
We them endless motherfuckers after all
We’ll have this whole world changed by tomorrow
Nigga I’m bound to make it
I told ‘em hoes I was gonna be ballin’
Like the shot off that glass, uh I caused it
They talkin’ ‘bout all my camp, nigga beg your pardon
I ain’t never had no foreign whip but I had a foreign bitch
Chasin’ juvenile like in the trip
And we all don’t get no chance like this
So I’m goin’ in, I’ll try my best to dodge them pigs
Tried my best to dodge that pig
If I could I’d do it again
Money racks they spend, I do it big
Check my paw prints, got the skills to pay my rent
Got enough game to take your bitch, girl be fuckin’ me big
My jersey numba and my main bitch
Be a 10, that’s some playa shit
But where we from only strong win ,and thats J.L.R
Yea yea yea

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Smoke DZA]
Rrriiight, the fuck you thought this was dawg
We them illest motherfuckers after all
Have this whole world changed by tomorrow
I’ll be the young high fellow, fly mellow
Straight from the ghetto, illest nigga out the triborough
And I’m the newest member of the jet life team
And i'mma bring my nigga Phelps mad more cream
Lo galore, kill these niggas looks fo’ sha
Bout to takem em back where thirstin took ‘em before
Ah, Kushed god, hear my scriptures
Know you see me in the Mag posing like Tazz in my picture
Rugby’s on the bed, rugby’s on the wall, rugby’s on the floor
Mirror, mirror, still the freshest of them all
I feel you bro, now them bitches think I’m ballin’
So they be actin’ differently when I be up in Harlem

[Hook]
