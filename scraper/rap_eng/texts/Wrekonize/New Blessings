[Intro]
Come on! ah Man
Come on! Man
Come on! if I could just tell you what's going on right now
You wouldn't believe
Its like everywhere I turn man
Come over with their hands out
All fucking people expecting shit
Man, I ain't with that man, I don't
You gotta do for self in this motherfucker

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Let me apologize in advance, let me excuse my future acts
Let me say sorry now if it'll help your feelings
Some way after the dance
Im leaving no more things up to chance
Changing my latitude and my longitude
And my attitude on that ass
So pardon me while I'm moving past
See I done been lived through my mistakes
I've taken wrong turns on the way
And I ain't taking no losses, I'm banging with bosses
And I ain't playing no games
I'm sorry if I sound like a lame
Sorry my numbers not displayed
They say you could tell me who you are
By showing me who in the company you make
And you're in the company of greats
Better make sure there's no mistake
Cause I got new focus, my crew is the dopest
The weight on my shoulder is giving me strength
Meanwhile I'm about to get rid of few things
Sorry to those who assumed we were friends
Now we about to blow and I'm about to go clean out my closet
There's shit I don't need

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I got big plans, I got big plans
To take over this world and be big man
I need stiff hands on a quick gram
Times a million spread over this land
Give me wealth, health, and a mezcal bottle
Full of throttle that'll get downed
I'm a super apostle with a threat now
Stepping over models with a pet sound
I need some legacy, legacy
Somebody to center me, center me
Maybe if I don't move now
I'll be doomed to keep it 100 like centipedes
Maybe a child, I spoke to my woman
We planning it out potentially
They say that there's no perfect timing
I know what it is, it'll be what it's meant to be
I'm checking my stockpile and my manifest
To give up what is dead to me
I'm making this room now for a new child
So please open the sesame
Oh he gon' be a celebrity or maybe science is his specialty
But little we knew that we literally brewed up two
And doubled the recipe

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings
Let's make room, make room, make room for new blessings

[Outro: Bernz & Wrekonize]
Ay man, its like, I know you know what I'm talking bout
Oh 100% I feel ya
It's like day after day after day, we come in here, we do our thing right
I mean that's all we do
We work, make a song everyday man
Everyday
I don't ask for no handouts, you ask for handouts? I ain't never seen you ask for shit
Nah I never ask for nothing, I don't know what it is
Like man, different strokes, I guess
We just gonna be here doing what we do
Fuck it
