It's the magnificent
The rapping equivalent
Of hittin' the lotto for two million dollars and no one to split it with
Ay, back again and over being underrated
I've been so slept on I leave lines in the faces
Wrekonize I am the one, my family strangers
Snake and bats, no wonder you don't feel the safest
Gold plaque on the way with me and Kendrick name on it
Even though most of his fans won't Wrekonize my name on it
Rappers on the majors must have majored makin' lames on it
Playin' it so safe might as well put my [?] on it
I've been ready to go further since I'm someone you might not have heard of
I'm willing to commit the murder of a beat it its good for the further
Tip your tender and server I'm trying to quiet the murmurs
But everybody got so quiet it's like we goin' riot, we making them nervous
People wanna speak about some beef, I'm not hearin' ya
A man just lost his whole entire family out in Syria
Twenty five family members are you fuckin' serious
Lifeless twins lie in his arms why aren't you people furious?
I just came for peace not here to beef with emcee such and such
But if they draw that line then I'm inclined for them to suck them nuts
Battle born, and bred, and off the head I bring the ruckus, chumps
Half the people talking shit is softer than the puppy's dump
Please if you're hearin' this do me a favor, cut out the [?] don't make the flavor
Everything lately is next to faker then a revolution Pepsi caters
Rappers are ignorant liars thinking that they can divide us
Oh what you thing you're the fliest well I think you should know we're united
Get the fuck out of your chair 'cause nothing to spare we learnin' no bias
My scripts have been clipping these kids since back in the day like Mikey Myers, Hollywood double entendre
Hollywood is where I would wander
Back in the days as a youngster, I read up on every genre
Study the bars, the breaks, the stars, the greats that I was so fond of
And now I'm like Frank Sinatra dabbing up over a tank of piranhas
Ay, I just took this flow, but
Ay, at least I told you though, and
Ay, if I didn't know then
Ay, I'd be Arby bro, but
Ay, truth be told that's kinda cold because I'm a drake fan
Even though that island accent's faker then a spray tan
Decade underneath me I've been here right in the base and
New fans think I just fell out the sky like a spaceman
I just keep it moving like I don't know how to brake down
Catch me rollin' up on to your porch like a mailman
Droppin' these bars and I'm ready to roll
We [?] steady control
They say that Benny's been lettin' it go
Being too humble on every go
Into the Further is where I show that I know [?]
Humble and I don't just set the tone
The date has been locked its better you know

[Outro]
May 5th
You already know
Haha
Into the Further
Less then a month away
Go get it
Wrekwensdays
Too Humble
