[Intro]
Talking Heads still talking shit like
And if you let them
They'll become the four walls that box you in
But we ain't gonna let that happen today

[Verse 1]
Keep talking all of that fake shit
I’mma pull up in a brand new spaceship
And turn everybody up no facelift
I heard your mouth run like it’s in the races
I create things you rate things
You been rookie and i’m rolling round 8 rings
Talk cheese but ya never even grate things
What a joke that you wrote on hate screens
I’m cap EO with the black steel
Old metaphor but it’s stands still
So keep pushing old rats to a standstill
Like we ain’t never knew how to run a cracked wheel
Been grinding and you been writing and rating from the sidelines
Biting and hating by the guidelines
Keep it coming till i’m rocking in the primetime like


[Hook]
They don’t ever go away
They just seem to talk all day
We just doing what we do
They only hearing what they say
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
Oh these walls these walls


[Verse 2]
Keep talking all of that fake shit
I’mma pull up in a brand new spaceship
And break a bone with a poem like statement
Jon Jones and the crowd goes apeshit
DC 2 step on the pavement
These frees ain’t free don’t pay trip
Cuz i been on it with a sonnet taking day trips
Through my mind all the way into the basement
Of this planet here with a damaged ear
Momma always said i’d be the man this year
And I believed her someone read the plans that’s here
I’m like Caesar waiting to command the cheers
I take leisure
By topping up and coming out to dominate the latter of the locks
So please let em know let it go kill the chatter that’s been all the matter rather keep the splatter in the box watch

[Hook]
They don’t ever go away
They just seem to talk all day
We just doing what we do
They only hearing what they say
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
Oh these walls these walls


[Verse 3]
Keep talking all of that fake shit
I’mma pull up in a brand new spaceship
One 3rd verse in no bass skip
White lines on tracks 3rd bass shit
That scarface M I A shit
What a stereotype for the ages
I’ll be in the live dive bar aces
Pouring up another cup and imma lace shit
You know the drill you see us showing skill
Morse code better bet it’s only real
They trying to kill more souls in a holy field
Cuz they don’t hear as well like Holyfield
And that’s real
I was rapping like this way before i even knew i’d ever have a deal
So fuck what you feel when the walls all squeal like

[Hook]
They don’t ever go away
They just seem to talk all day
We just doing what we do
They only hearing what they say
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
These walls keep talking at me
Oh these walls these walls
They don't ever go away
