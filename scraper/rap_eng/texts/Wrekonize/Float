[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
If they got chains, I got aim
To be livin' in the middle of the lane
And they feel it's strange that I'm plain
But it feels quite right to be sane
I've been locked down to the lounge
And I can't get a route to be proud of, I'm living in code
Everything I plant in the ground comes back to me now
How stylish I'm feeling en vogue
What you got a house in the hills just south of Brazil sounds nice we been gettin' roundhoused to the grill
But it's cool, we don't need whole lotta clout doused to be real
Everything I ever wanted just right here
Smiles bout a mile wide, yes, my dear
Lotta health, little wealth, and a check I clear
Without somebody trying to come and wreck my gears
God damn what a day to be walkin' tall
Bottle full of whiskey and barking dogs
From South Beach out into to Arkansas
They tellin' me the evils about to fall
So we just keep on doin' what we all been doin' bruh
I let 'em know
That they can't get a stand if we ain't on the ground
Don't walk with me now ya just float

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
Soon as you turn the pages I'm sure that you will find
This vibin' is contagious, it's known to blow your mind
See death has many faces, but life is mighty fine
So if you think you're outta time
Just come now and turn the pages, I'm sure that you will find
This vibin' is contagious, it's known to blow your mind
See death has many faces, but life is so divine
So if you think you're outta time (come on!)

[Hook: Wrekonize & Lindy Miller]
I could show you how to float
Ah ah ahh! Ah ah ahh! Ah ah ahh!
I could show you how to float
Ah ah ahh! Ah ah ahh! Ah ah ahh!
I could show you how to float (come on!)
Ah ah ahh! (come on!)
Ah ah ahh! (come on!)
Ah ah ahh! (come on!)
I could show you how to float (come on!)
Ah ah ahh! (come on!)
Ah ah ahh! (come on!)
Ah ah ahh!

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
If I got aim, they got pain
And they keep blowin' up into the blame
On a people that just came for some change
Like we don't have a right to complain
I been goin' downtown with the sound bros
All the real people that are in the town know
That when we come around we bring the party down low
For the ones that could never hear us on the outro
I got fam in all states, puttin' jam on all plates
I've been battlin' the rates but the tides are changing
See the spice is cajun, mics are blazing
You might recognize the arrangement
I'm a boom-bap child with a trapped out style that keeps Ben in the basement
With a bowl full of soul and nobody I could talk to I'm awfully patient
Whatchu got? Whatchu need? Who you were? Who you be?
Here's a detailed statement
What you believe in can also be a page you are not even aware that you're tracin'
But we keep it all goin' for the day in day out love of the nation
If you need to float with me take your legs to the head and forget about the pavement

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
Soon as you turn the pages I'm sure that you will find
This vibin' is contagious, it's known to blow your mind
See death has many faces, but life is mighty fine
So if you think you're outta time
Just come now and turn the pages, I'm sure that you will find
This vibin' is contagious, it's known to blow your mind
See death has many faces, but life is so divine
So if you think you're outta time (come on!)
