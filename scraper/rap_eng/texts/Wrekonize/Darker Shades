[Verse 1 - Bernz]:
Yeah. It's a fly love song. Ha
Back myself in a corner, just to fight my way out
Bothered by my persona, fake friends run they mouth
Half of them fucking goners, other half just don’t count
It’s cool; I’ll be a stoner
Be a guy on the couch

[Hook - Bernz]:
I’ll be alright
I'll-I’ll be alright
I got myself some whiskey; enough to last the night
I’ll be alright
I'll-I’ll be alright
I got some darker shades, for these brighter nights

[Verse 2 - Wrekonize]:
We let these biters bite
Gonna get up and I'll take this stage
I’ve got no face to save
No bridge to pave
I’m nothing but a paper slave
But I play this ancient game
Like I never had a piece of something
So I’m keeping all my speakers bumping
For the ones who’re waking up and keep us plugged in

[Hook - Wrekonize]

[Hook 2 - Wrekonize]:
You may be dangerous, but I don’t see you
You may be God to them, but to us you’re see through
We tryna to take the day, ‘cause ain’t nothing left to take
No longer have to wait; we living shorter days with
Darker shades, darker shades, darker shades for a brighter night
Darker shades, darker shades, darker shades for a brighter night

[Verse 3 - Bernz]:
They say that we too rowdy, carry a dead man’s rhymes
Miami’s got these vices, I can’t get out my mind
Everyday walk a wasteland, wasting our urban life
Lately my mind is racing, but there’s no finish line

[Hook - Bernz]

[Verse 4 - Wrekonize]:
We look with hypersights, seeing out into the future still
Giving dummies a bit of bloody and running with a couple buddies
If he tryna shoot to kill
This here’s no movie reel, no Cool Hand Luke appeal
Where the youth is real, you gotta move to still survive
When they want to nuke our fields

[Hook - Wrekonize]
