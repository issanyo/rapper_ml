[Intro:]
On today's episode of beats that weren't produced for me
Marvin Gaye & Chardonnay, Strange Music
You know I've never really seen Miami from this angle, but uh
I gotta be honest with you, haha, I kinda like it
I'mma borrow a few styles on this one if you don't mind, let's go!

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Kill 'em with a little bit of kindness, mine yes
Miller in the middle of a minus, mine is
Divvy a retail, you give me my three sales
Put kitties in the video behind us, minors
Killin' every last city we run through
Ya late to get the message I'mma figure ya gum's chewed
Ya hatin' on the presence but the method is dumb cool
Ya done fool, I'mma let you wait for the 1-2
Salute to the general Tech N9ne!
Movin' subliminal but they let us get by
Tryin' to sign you'll never catch Wrek's rhyme
Every battle is mine, I smile and tell ya "Next time!",
Just another early warning
From another alien in the dirty sormon
Give me just a mallion and I'm good for touring
Hungover like I'm fucked but I'm up good morning

[Hook:]
Early in the morning, when she's all alone
I'mma sneak into her room put new shit on her phone
I'mma have her hooked on that Strange Music and ¡MAYDAY!
Aaay-aaay!
Early in the morning, when she's all alone
I'mma sneak into her room put new shit on her phone
I'mma have her fiendin' for that Strange Music and ¡MAYDAY!
Aaay-aaay!

Alright I'mma pull my dick out on this one
So you prolly wanna step back...

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Sippin' on the KC Tea like Aquafina
Chillin' in Miami where the broads are meaner
Stock is cheaper, blocks are greener
Then again I prolly shouldn't drop this ether
Why the walls all shaded Easter?
Mushrooms got me lookin' at some crazy features
Now I'm in here feelin' like Satan's teacher
Nah I'm kidding I'm a atheist preacher!
Get it poppin' while I'm all up in the Denver scene
Next to me up in the Texas dream
World's outta shape and we bent the beams, shit
Pregnant teens are takin' Mescaline
I'm that menace with the roaring drum
Killin' time waitin' for the next tour to run
I'm the new code killer, filling whores for fun
So you motherfuckers know that when the morning comes

[Hook 2x]
