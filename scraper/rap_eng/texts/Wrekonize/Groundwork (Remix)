[Intro: Wrekonize]
Let's go back to church, you ever get that feeling?
That you're not alone? Yeah, yeah I get that too
Wait, actually, I got some friends with me right now

[Verse 1: Co$$]
Yo, from ash to ass to dust
They dollar be they pope they praisin'
Dope and I'm like 'Nope' so they callin' me blasphemous
Fuck that ignorant, they want me to show my ass
If you got Eminem's complexion some - nuckers (?) turn to slaves
God bless your soul nah, God curse you spirit
Comin' with that Jew shit fear this
Stompin' on these niggas toes, FE FI FO
The industry got niggas chemically imbalanced
You don't need no talent these days
Just somebody that you know - in the game
But I'mma put some hurt - in ya frame
With the rhythm cleat you know I'm kickin' dirt. on ya name
I'm the realest me you niggas fake and front what ya playin'?
Or you could beek another gain some image in exchange
For some fame, take his name
Claim you doin' what he did
Fuck the truth, if it's gon' get you paid
You gon' slang them fears to them kids
Tell me, who slang rock?
Who shootin' at them niggas on the block
Who pistol cocked?
You's a mixture of that 'Pac and that pot that you be puffin'
I keep it movin' like the hands on the Doomsday clock
I got's to keep my mental focus on the top
Cause the minute that you slip, the next minute yo shit flop
And forgot, like, "Who was that Co$$? I can't recall", cause
Most these niggas shootin' for stars, they aim is off, get
Covered then, smothered by famous they frame resolve
In the scripture those who turn to Saul, became the sought
Dumb nucker, we so called mens we thumb-suckers
When we starin' in the eyes of the storm, become wind
Yeah, in a game where some win
Some sell they soul to be on what we on but we gone

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Shake limits and take it to fake gimmicks
Even create image, shit do what you must to break ground
I'm in it for great livin', the fannin' and great givin'
Man my kingdom was made to break ground
To break ground, to break ground, to break grou-ah-ah-ound
To break ground, to break ground, to break grou-ah-ah-ound

[Verse 2: Akrobatik]
I break ground like earthquakes, sledgehammers
Livin' on the edge, man I been rotted
Same time true melodic, (Who the hottest?)
Akrobatik, Wrekonize, Ruthless artists
Ladies taste the blue exotic, 'Bartender, two hypnotics'
Our crew demolish while you lookin' for some shoes to polish
Too cool for college so I hit the streets to do my knowledge
You fuck around and catch a group of brolic brothers standin'
Troop asylum ready to get super violent lyrical
Bazookas wildin', with the fuckin' force to nuke a island
You ain't sayin' shit unless it's some'n you can do for my kin
My crew supplyin' all that shit you love when you get high and
Pass the L around and lift your mind state, to the sky and
Levitate, for a minute, meditate, while I spit it
To be great, I'm committed, so I take it to the limit and beyond
This shit that I'm on got the whole planet trippin' love
That's why I'm always gone I break ground

[Verse 3: Ras Kass]
Sam Speed told y'all, think you better Wrekonize
Y'all heroes jump off the roof, I respect The Other Guys
Check my pulse it's pumpin' BP
Leakin' on the Gulf I clean it up just hook me to a IV
See me like a construction work, a construction Tim's hard hat
Buildin' like a master mason
I will serve a God that, bag of chips I'm all that
Standin' on a scaffold made of dead rappers
Good Native American pussy is red snapper
Son, y'all niggas is big dummies I'm Fred Sanford
This goes out to Tampa, Orlando, Miami
San Diego, Oakland, Los Angeles County
Allow me to move dirt, like the Sandman
Crack the earth to proportions of the Grand Canyon
Damn y'all stand under unstable tables of foundation
Can't comprehend? I'm ground breakin'

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rudi Goblen]
The monkey's out the bottle
So I spit-shine my own light bulb, then cover ya back
Cause epiphanies to follow
Me to put a knife in the fan and apply planning
See a man that can't stand is a man that can't land it
So where ya guts at, you stutter and stumbling
You need stuff your stories in a sack and set your pace back
Avoid the void from coming, you running yo shit is bubbling
I plummet and push the pedal palm the problems in the ground beef
I'll be, THAT vagabond out in South Beach
Screamin' "I'm gon' make it!" 'til my motherfucking lungs bleed
Pardon me mister, I got a press packet pistol
That I'll shoot ya with
When I write the right for my stage life
How many people know G? Well I know that I don't give a butt
Cause I'm fuckin' luck until it owes me
See I'm a Flipside King drinking Crown, clown
Those who oppose it gettin' stuck if they don't bow down

[Verse 5: Saheed]
This is ground breakin', I leave the town shakin'
You don't never hear 'bout Saheed sittin' 'round waitin'
I gotta take it I'm tired of bein' patient
Run up in the station tell the DJ play dis so everybody's gettin'
SPRAYED, I'm tryna' get PAID, cause brother I be
Bangin' out classics everyday
Rock on top of beats and break the foundation where you lay
I swear to God the strength is right there upon the stage
When I'm there
The competition here that's sayin', "This is not fair!"
Fuck you, you should call this filterin' the top tier
Yo I be wreckin' mics and breakin' ground with Wrekonize
I pick the best of everything and put the rest aside
I get my blessings right, cause I'm in this for great livin'
New Year's resolution was to be on top by Thanksgiving
You should be thankful you'll be safe 'til November now
Rearrange your agenda or leave this place in a stretcher

[Interlude]
(What in the hell are they waiting for?)
I ain't think we'd have time for this, but uh
Fuck it

[Verse 6: Wrekonize]
My song's tellin' me to take cover and y'all
Better be ready to brawl, enemies heavenly fall
Whether we rock the spot, or not, the Embassy
Has got you online searchin' for pop like Tron Legacy
I'm schizophrenic with career goals
I'd like to show you what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
Got time? Well here goes
Took it from Madeline to rockin' out with Cash Money
Makin' some Strange Music who's to take that from me?
I'd like to see them claim they're that hungry
I see 'em in their whips, waitin' for hits
Like fuckin' crash dummies
I walk the planet underhanded but I'm overjoyed
To walk towards the light excited, I'm a solar droid
I'll make the sound smirk underneath the clown shirt
Jugglin' the clown jerk, you got a life and found worth
I got millennia to take you through the outskirts
But that's a job I'll gladly accept, cause that's my groundwork
