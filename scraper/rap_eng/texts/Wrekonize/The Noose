[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I've tried writing this letter now several times before
When the party is over and the liquor is no more
I'll tell you now that living has become somewhat a chore
And following their rules is such a god forsaken bore
Now I say "God" because I'm programmed, but I believe in none
I see no interventions, and I see no holy sons
And if I'm wrong, then strike me down and break these breathing lungs
Just take the words, reverse 'em back upon my evil tongue
I've seen children harm each other like it's second nature, some
Just want to watch the world burn and bang upon the drums
And that is why the music and the rhythm will live on
'Cause chaos has a melody and death is like a song

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
I sing, sing out to the rafters, I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
I'm trying to find a way to just sing
Sing out to the rafters, I sing
Close this little chapter and I think
This life is a disaster and it stings
You see I'm trying to find a way out

[Hook]
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I went to visit wounded soldiers out on Camp Pendleton
And the cause of the missing limbs it mean that it's no love like Wimbledon
When they sat before me young as hell and gave me accolades like gentlemen
I'm thinking that the enemy took away their ability to walk and to touch
No way of rekindling
What it's now gone, unless they got money like Forrest and Lt. Dan
The war, if you in it, damn, they have no remorse at any minute, Bam!
That's fucked off, while we chillin' on tour on the bus getting sucked off
Know our families grieving 'cause war is receding
Their peeps have been crying their butts off
That's why I give so much when I flow bust, why we got it so good?
Cause it's so rough, for the young soldiers who
Do exactly what they're told to do... damn
Through exactly what they told to do
Defend the country and uphold the crew
But give my one and only soul for U (S.A.)?
That's a hell of a job description, I don't know if my God's with this one
But I guess it's the laws of sick men
Send out young'ns and they fall the victim
Of an evil clan's plan, that's why I be saying "Dwamn"
Cause on 9/11 I realized our fate is in another man's hands

[Hook]
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end

[Verse 3: Bernz]
When I see how my loved ones have left
I wonder how long I would fight
I wonder if I would give in or let the reaper lead me into night?
See I got too much pride left, like my grandmother died too earlier
Reaching for moments more but the cancer in her lungs took her from me
We drift, naturally, like two ships in the roughest of seas
That's why this moment is precious, yet I'm too distant to feel it complete
See these days I feel so disconnected, it gets harder to drop to my knees
I guess that's a side-effect of living in Generation X-Y-Z
Obsessed with pain and greed, man I wish we were kids again
Things were simple then
90's incidents got me losing friends to the hands of violent men
Fast, faster than speeding bullets whizzing down alleyways
I probably am waking up from this haze
But only to realize the world hasn't changed
Some of y'all not even fazed, y'all think it's the way we've been raised?
Fuck it, I'll stick him right back in his haze
Cause these could turn out to be my last today's
With a hope and a prayer put a rope in the air, but I'm just too scared
Choking from the pressure when I rock this chair
Swing back and forth and tempt Death with a blank stare

[Hook]
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
What a world, what a world
I'm hanging up the noose now
Waiting for the end
