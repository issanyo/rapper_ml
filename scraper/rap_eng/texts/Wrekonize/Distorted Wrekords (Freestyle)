Back again and I’m reloaded
Week 3 with a mean moment
MC to me means move the crowd
To them it seems to mean meek coding
Don’t understand the term freestyle
They might as well just be free loading
I’m free thinking I’m free floating
Got a free spirit so free flowing

Follow me and catch another body you can swallow
I been rocking for a minute never thought about tomorrow
But I came to get it popping take the topper off the bottle
I’m the one who come a knocking Heisenberg in sleepy hollow
Break an idiot right down to cinnamon and let em wallow
If they needed style they shoulda come to me I’d let em borrow
But they wanna be the baddest and I’m here to give em throttle
Battery up in they back and I’m the Temple of Apollo
Running round the circles ciphering I had the flow
To get up in the battle then I’m taking all they souls
That's including family and everyone they know
If they slow don’t show be alone gotta go
Sitting at the bar drinking like I’m on a barge
Out on Mars with a guitar strumming it for all the stars
I been large and in charge nah not really but I’m charged

I got Majors acting like independents
Independents dressed up like majors
Everybody’s out checking for me
But I ditched my smart phone for a stupid pager
I’m in little Cuba Nica Venezuela
Trying to tell consuela
I’m her super neighbor
She don’t hear me cuz I’m too aloof with flavor
She down on her knees and praying to her savior
Break it down I’m just too composed
I got voices in my head that’s speaking to me now with beaucoup flows
But nobody even knows I’m coo coo though
There’s a novel full of shit that you don’t know
But you hide it from us like it’s usual
Down on all 4 licking booty holes
I let you just go it’s your funeral
I don’t mean to be forthcoming
But I’m OG FLA cousin
All these new cats are my fucking sons
They just got trapped trying to run from it
Pilled out getting numb from it
Didn’t pay homage now they stock plummet
I’m that peak shit I’m that rock summit
All that lean shit gimme knot stomach
Back up off and get another one that you can run up
All these one ups got me feeling like I’m just that mother fucker
Everybody wanna come and get a little bit of supper
But they never pay the bills little kiddies mini muppets
I been summoned for the ones that’s bumping us until the summer
When we turn up all the heat burning like we turning rubber
Everybody know the morse code tap into your lovers
We don’t slim stroke or ever short flow you fuckers
But I’m known for deep dicking your next chill
So when you finally make it out over to her
In the bedroom you hear "Yes" still
Benny never got a better Betty but there many
When I’m ready every one of them is getting super friendly
I was petty but I’m steady free falling for the pennies
At the Getty we got ever ready
Playing through my many
Distorted records
