[Chorus]x2
Life's a bitch and then ya die
That's why we get high, That's why we get high

[One ton]
Light up another joint
I gots to get my head right
I live a crazy life
Hatin' ho's and shady types
No red lights or stop signs
I'm all gas
Living the fast lane
I goes hard and talk trash
Life's a bitch and mary-jane's a pimp
So i just roll another spliff
Until my problems don't exist
Forget my bad decisions
Fuck everybody trippin'
They wanna catch me slippin'
I'm just tryna make a living
I do me and do dabs with my vape pen
I don't listen to the gossip
I just make bread
I hustle hard work all night i stay fed
Then celebrate by getting white boy wasted
My weed is so loud
I don't hear no negatives
I roll them so thick like rich peoples relatives
Will i go to heaven or will i go to hell?
I'm blowing smoke rings rolling up another L

[Chorus]x2

[Underrated]
Ayo
Life is kinda crazy
It takes us on a ride
Analyze every move
I'm just tryna to get by
We all got family and some love to provide
Celebrate living we all love to get high
But the world ain't perfect and it never ever will be
Everybody tryna get paid and buy some realty
Ain't nobody real and the game is so filthy
But i still remain positive until it kills me
It's what i do
I try to do it everyday
And if you think that it can happen
Then you prolly on your way
To gettin what ya want
Never quit bruh
Gotta fight through the moment
Blow the shit up
Roll a fat one
Smoke it to the cranium
Thinking about how everybody underrated em'
Having visions of a sold out stadium
Haters try to hold me down
But i just say to em'

[Chorus]x2

[Wrekonize]
I'm on the clouds
I sit back and watch walls melt
Do what i know
And couldn't give a damn if yall fell
Morse code and rebeled out with dark vapors
The sky right when everybody else is art tapers
We pen messages and push them full throttle
Inside a glass bottle mailed out to colorado
Mezcal sippin lesses for Don juan
My mind starts slippin'
My [?] Has been long gone
My swan song is greened out and all wavy
Cloudy mind state has got me feeling lost lately
Time traveling drop stress from my abdomen
In glass sky high getting by like a javelin
Lessons to learn
Mad stresses to burn
So i just kick back with family
The rest is adjourned
If you need me i'll be up
Looking out above the stars
Kicking bars with the gods
Tryna win against the odds
That's Life!

[Chorus]x2
