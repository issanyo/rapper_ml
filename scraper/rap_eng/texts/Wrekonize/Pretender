[Chorus: Common Kings]
Had a good night that I can’t remember
I try but I can’t forget her
Can’t remember when we got together
I tried but I can’t forget her
I learned to keep it together
But I can be a pretender
No
That one night it felt like forever
I tried still I can’t forget her

[Verse 1: Bernz]
I met her when my spaceship crash-landed
Crashed into a strange new planet
The moment I first saw her standing
I fell in her trance
Yes I fell in her trap
I communicated through the body language
The closer that we got we understand it
The time is getting closer there’s no time to take it slow
So she ran and stole my heart just like a bandit
Now I’m trying to get it right
Time after time I look for ghosts
In every word I ever wrote

[Chorus: Common Kings]
Had a good night that I can’t remember

No
That one night it felt like forever
I tried but I can’t forget her

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]

You pop up in the deck whenever I can rewind
That night we came together it was rather sublime
Now I fathom your mind
Over half of the time
She got skills!
That girl took over my wheel
To move on and to build
To raise up in my guild
If you told me she had gills
I’d probably think you were for real
‘Cause she’s been swimming the depths of my subconscious what a thrill
I know she shoots to kill ‘cause I’ve got bullets in my temple
The truth is super ill when you’ve been used to looser tempos
But, huh
I know that might have been a one time
Evapourate the sunshine
Kinda like back when you was mine

[Common Kings]
Had a good night that I can’t remember
I try but I can’t forget her
Can’t remember when we got together
I tried but I can’t forget her
I learned to keep it together
But I can be a pretender
No
That one night it felt like forever
I tried but I can’t forget her
