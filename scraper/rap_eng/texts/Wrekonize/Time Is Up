[Hook: Stige, Bernz & Wreknoize]
I have it in the air course
I have it out my window
Oh, I have it in the ghetto
They only saying what they saying just to sway us
They say our time is up
Our time is up
They say our time is up
Our time is up, ohhh

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Time is short, but time and time again we make the live report
I fly with force 'cause everything is timing when the sky is forged
Wake up to the bad news
Notify me past due
Time gets money hungry, it'd be nice if it ain't have to
And gas through what have you's
Small talk, cashews
They catch you and crash through
Any kind of cash do
I walk up to the ATM, they asking for my birthright
They told me nothing's promised so I keep on shining searchlights

[Verse 2: Bernz]
That's right, Bernz is up
Second hand is closing in, lets burn her up
Grab your shit and let it through your thing before the coffins plunge
Let it bust
Give 'em all a smoke before the fire trucks
Self combust
Fire squad is lit when they all line is up
And make us the examples
Frame us with their scandals
When all I try'na do is jump the fuck out of the band though
They wanna be Skywalkers when they really more like Landos
Time is what you make until they bury you in landfills

[Hook: Stige, Bernz & Wreknoize]
I have it in the air course
I have it out my window
Oh, I have it in the ghetto
They only saying what they saying just to sway us
They say our time is up
Our time is up
They say our time is up
Our time is up, ohhh

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Okay we checking clocks for better spots
Time is up, you better watch
My wrecking crew is Renaissance
They check us for correct response
I'm blinded by these vices
I'm talking devices
This keeping me sleep, lifeless
I used to be free, righteous
But now I wake under a cold-hearted right hand
Trying to find the right plan for tonight's scam
They say accept it cause it's evil and just like man
I'm all the way out here like "Damn what a lifespan"

[Verse 4: Bernz]
No snooze cycle, got my psyche going psycho
Worshiping some false idols while we running for the silos
Be the fucking headline just to fight for my survival
And a strong landline for my future disciples
See them praise the artificial, why we denying this lie?
They thought we skipping over issues until we land on a mine
A few are actually living while the rest of us died
I think I'm finally about to open my eyes and then rewind

[Hook: Stige, Bernz & Wreknoize]
I have it in the air course
I have it out my window
Oh, I have it in the ghetto
They only saying what they saying just to sway us
They say our time is up
Our time is up
They say our time is up
Our time is up, ohhh

[Outro]
Is time real?
Is time, time real?
Think
