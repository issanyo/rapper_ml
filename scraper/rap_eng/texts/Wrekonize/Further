[Intro]
Yep
Feels like we been here before

[Verse 1]
It's the return of the one that just Can't Be Alone
A Typical cat is known to visit the path on Church Road
A Freak that's into his mind, now above the Neon Skies
A Modern Man who's out for Better Things, we gon' Rise
Loaded Galil has got me filled up on Adrenaline and
I'm fearing the Paper Trails, Anxiety Attacks again
Floating Away and Haunted by the grip of sleazy goals
Easy Money still don't exist but bet that We Got Soul
So

[Hook]
Do you wanna go further now?
Can I take you further now?
Do you wanna go further now?
Let's take it further now

[Verse 2]
On a rock where the people draw these lines into the sand
To separate us all with hate upon our fellow man
I travel the globe and meet as many people as I can
Before they come and try to strike us down right where we stand
The upper hand is quite deceiving when it waves you bye
It's easy to not be grateful for the things you pay no mind
But take those things away from the people and when they do find
That they don't have exactly what they want it's killing time
I decline, you'll find me further now with each command
Each step that I take towards the other side is planned
Each day I treat like a lifetime inside my hand
What to do is for me to choose, well isn't that just grand?
I'm still hearing the ghosts of family members passing by
And still seeing so many souls that waste the fact they live
I catalog my every step and breath into my spine
So even when I make mistakes, at least I know they're mine
Fine

[Hook]
Do you wanna go further now?
Can I take you further now?
Do you wanna go further now?
Let's take it further now
Into the Further

[Outro]
You have now entered the further
Trust nothing, trust no one
Be wary of the clones
