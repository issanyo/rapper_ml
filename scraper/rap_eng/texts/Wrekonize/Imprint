[Intro: Bernz]
Yeah, they say a fingerprint is one of a kind
Yeah, yeah, roll it up, hey!

[Hook: Bernz]
Together all the time
By the time I bounced, left an imprint on her mind
It's feelin' like a crime
Ingorin' her advances, she's ignorin' the signs
Together all the time
By the time I bounced, left an imprint on her mind
It's feelin' like a crime
By now I think you need to know the need to go is mine

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
You knew, you knew, that this would end up bad
I gave, I gave you almost all I had
To give you love, it ain't no easy test
This dreams been fun, but please just wake me fast
Now it's almost through, nothin' you could do
Time for me to move and the imprint stuck on you

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jovi Rockwell]
It's funny baby, cause I ain't talkin' trash
But I'm the one that's on your mind
So why you wanna change that
Why you wanna break that down?
Make me into a villain
Call me super fixin', why?
When you the one that's trippin'
Turn around and flipped it around
Turn around and flipped me 'round
My world is turnin' upside down
And we go down, down, down, slow-ow
And we go round, round, round
Imprint stuck on you

[Hook]
