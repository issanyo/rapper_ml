[Intro: Wrekonize]
Hey
Sunny Winter
Dos

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
â€‹I'm kinda feeling like Murdoch running round a city in the darkness
And at times my mind is trying to find the lines to prove that I ain't heartless
And I know where the ark is
In an apartment where I rely on parchment and vibe in the margins
I try to grind like Stark and keep rhyming the lines that's providing the margarine
But it's trolling season bunch of mother fuckers throwing stones for reasons that is so deceiving that I'm froze this evening
I don't even really feel like holding a meeting
Hello fam my name is Wrek I keep a mellow hand I never threw closed fist at a fellow man
But swoll up took shots like Lenos chin
Got me falling and falling through miles of the jargon
Well I'll be begging your pardon
Wouldn't you say not having to pay on a day like today's one hell of bargain
We all pirates right stealing what we want to live a Pirates life
The bare minimums of minimums surviving like
We ain't really got a choice we gon thrive tonight
So gimme grain gimme brain gimme alcohol
Old pledge on a ledge and he bout to fall
Somebody catch ol Ben like a Bouncing ball
Cuz he ain't really been the same since the mountains called
He got Intel on his sim cell
Bout the Intel
Automated making it seem it ain't been real
Well I can tell Siri is seriously in my entrails
What a hypocrite right
Trying to unplug when he's digital
Right
Everything's synced from the sink to the lights
And he just keeps thinking "well isn't this nice"
Isn't this Nice
Isn't this...nice?
Isn't it?
Nice

[Outro Hook: Wrekonize ]
I don't want to do this dance no more
Please don't make me stand
I don't want to do this dance no more
Winter you've laid down again
