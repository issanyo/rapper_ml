[Hook: Wrekonize]

Even with all this technology
My friends still find it hard to talk to me
Im out of reach
Even with all this technology
The closer that we get the farther that we seem
Technology

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]

Walkin down a darkened road
I find this world is strange
Unlike where we grew up
Crafty clones that have no name
Looking to loan you love
And nobody gives a fuck
And now theyve missed me so
I got a million bytes at home
I find another way to gain a little human soul
Im so high my my
I gotta keep my downloading down low
I thought that you were here but i fear its on the mode
This distance is existance my missions up in smoke
Im tryin to find a way out before the walls all implode
So

[Hook: Wrekonize]

[Verse 2: Bernz]
USB you and me
Gotta reconnect so desperately
I left a long time ago
Though never left you physically
Im on auto pilot
Think im here i doubt it
Try to scream and shout it
But its distorted
Can't afford it
Too much to lose
We all play the fool
Every now and then we all are tool
Swim in a ces pool
With my fam in a roman rule
No school ghetto geek sheek
Movie of the week picture seems bleak
Try to call but im hard to reach
Isolated constantly fuckin faded
Debated wether or not
I would blow or i would rot
Just robot outdated out
2.5 kids brand new co op
Im reachin out
Lookin out till its figured out
Won't talk out its useless
These boys done shut the highway down
And next is touch
Dont take much
One more pill then im almost stunned
Red ones blue ones its fun
O.d'ed watchin re runs
Some of my parts
Stopped my heart cuz i ain't that smart
I got lost just like the rest
I digitized and lost access

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Even though i sleep without ya
I can see you in my dreams
They say that were so connected
But i can't even hear you scream
Even though i sleep without ya
I still see you in my dreams
They say that were so protected
But weve been locked up by machines
I need a way to break down
Find a place for me to go
So we can disconnect from this whole evil show
This rock is an outlet
Which we drown in each light of day
And if you find me in a place where i can lie out in the snow
Than id be lying if i told you that i didn't wanna grow
Lets finally sink our shoes inside the soil
And pray to jobs that we can stay
