[Intro: Wrekonize]
If I never existed would you be alarmed?
If we minus the friction would it do you harm?
Was I meant to be gone from all we know is wrong?
I think its time to pack my bags cause im moving on

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Don't ya wanna?
Let's just hide out
(x2)

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
You see these hills have had eyes on me ever since the day I stopped crawling
Wrek'll start falling that's kettle cart calling potholes
On my stairway to heaven the airplay im getting seems fair wait a second
Ive been running away from the wrong damn arrows
With this strong mans shadow
Then along came narrow minded pardon my time is shallow
I speak in codes chasing things that no one know is there
I know your scared so take your souls and throw them in the air
Im leaving on a jet plane
And this sour mashed whiskey's bout' to lift me out the next frame
Build a house up on the outskirts and fortify
Everything we might of let slide on the borderline
They used to dream the scheme
Now they forget to sell
This place is Exile, I'll keep an extra cell
Propose to solitude im hearing wedding bells
Im climbing Jacob's ladder
My heaven is your hell

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Give em' everything I got
Give em' everything I earned
Still it don't amount to nothing more than just a bridge to burn
On a road outside the bubble what I saw's another world
What I gave was Â¡MAYDAY! music
But back home heads are burrowed
Rock bottom girls
With some uptown problems
Red bottoms got em' blinded, faking love before they solve em'
I guess I wait for autumn either that run for the hills
You don't want to see Michael Douglas ordering breakfast meals
I wonder how a free fall feels
To eat lunch on a ledge
Turkey Swiss on a baguette
They say I ain't right in the head
Missing tools inside the shed
Cause I'd rather chill inside instead of catering for fake friends
So I guess I play pretend now
Build myself a fort and then protect it with my pals
Fuck the non-believers I jam receivers with frequencies
Too advanced to them so Im an outcast frequently

[Hook]
