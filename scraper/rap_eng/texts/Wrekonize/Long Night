[Hook: Bernz]
Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night
Long night
‘Cause lately all I’ve been living is short days
Baby I’m trying to do it all night
All night
So tell your mama don’t wait up you gon' be home late
Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night

So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Into the city into my land of sin
See I’m in it to win it, innit? So grab a friend
It’s going to be a long one, extra innings
She said that we could just get high until we hit the ceiling
We bar hopping MIA we like to start at Purdy
I’m into shots I let it rock ‘cause they don’t ever hurt me
Lies
I’m riding sky high feeling flirty
Bianca out celebrating her dirty thirties
Moving out the EP for the Love Below
The drinks ain’t cheap but maneuvers hook me for the low
Then we go to Bordeaux to see the show
That girl is throwing up somebody must have let her go
Miami at its finest can be sort of scary
Especially when your blackbird is so extraordinary
If you want a long night I write the more the merry
Who can you trust to ride with us?

[Hook: Bernz]
Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night

Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Hey think it’s time for a break
I’ve been working up in this bitch for like everyday
I’ve been slaving away
I’ve been planning the great escape
Somebody come pick me up at a quarter to 8
Come and take me away
Need a minute to get me straight
Been working up in the lab on an order for Mr. Yates
Been goin' insane
Lucid dreaming while I’m awake
Head in a daze
Now I start to hallucinate
Just practice up in the whip and let's hit up the fucking mall
And light up a couple spliffs ’til it’s thick as a fucking fog
Just right up and down the strip playing Mayday ’til it’s dawn
And hit up a couple chicks, throw a party back at the home
Whatever yo, I don’t care, I need something to get me right
I need a night on the town before somebody pay the price
I’d die to be nothing crazy, a bottle of something nice
And enough trees to last the night
Because it’s ‘bout to be

[Hook: Bernz]
A long night
Long night
‘Cause lately all I’ve been living is short days
Baby I’m trying to do it all night
All night
So tell your mama don’t wait up you gon' be home late
Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night
Long night
‘Cause lately all I’ve been living is short days
Baby I’m trying to do it all night
All night
So tell your mama don’t wait up you gonna be home late
So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into
So tell me what we getting into
Into
Into
So tell me what we getting into

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Ten o'clock hit the stage
Done at 12 but I’m waiting for Ross Rick to say
When they leaving a tally for the club ‘cause we in the same town
Bang Blaow
Now we’re off the tour bus and this could pay
He said we meet at the club at 1
Called an Uber and it’s done
So we made it by like 1:30
Still then it was plum early
When he showed it was all loving all B’s up
Black bottles gonna erupt
He told us we don't need cups
Boss
60K for a walkthrough
But he did five songs still
Fuck it he got long mills
Bottles stay on chill
And on grills
Gave me the mic, I did a song at like 3:30
Rosé, Kali and me swervy
Said thank you to Ro
Then we left the party at 4
At like 5 O’clock here we go
Right back on the tourbus we slow-mo
From lights
My lady ‘cause own hype
To help me jerk my strong pipe
And I’m twisted so girl it’s 'bout to be

[Hook: Bernz]
A long night
Long night
‘Cause lately all I’ve been living is short days
Baby I’m trying to do it all night
All night
So tell your mama don’t wait up you gon' be home late
Ey yo I’m trying to have a long night
Long night
‘Cause lately all I’ve been living is short days
Baby I’m trying to do it all night
All night
So tell your mama don’t wait up you gon' be home late
So tell me what we getting into

[Outro: Alina Eakins]
Hey. What's up? It's me
So about last night... Things got a little out of control
I'm normally not that kind of girl
But I was have a really great time and... It was in the moment
And I don't what came over me
Let's just keep what happened between us
