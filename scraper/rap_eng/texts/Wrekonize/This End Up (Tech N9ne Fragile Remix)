[Verse 1]
I'm fragile
Keep this end up
If my head ain't in the clouds
I don't know how I'm gonna end up
I'm too attached to my mind
I wanna try and pour my feelings in a red cup
Flowin' solo, man I'm so fed up
Let me see if I can tell you what I feel
And see if you can feel it too
And if you do, I think it's time to spill
The illness I've felt, I don't kiss tell
But that policy has led to my defeat
I followed it and it's the reason that I fell
Victim to deceit, I've been feeding demons
Even though they are the reason for my cell
Self-created, isolated
In my glass castle in the sky
I feel safer if I can evade the earth
And just observe the task of askin' why
Everything's the way it is, everything's a quiz
Just give me the answer key so I can give
To my fantasy cause I'm afraid to live
I'm sensitive, I'm (fragile)

[Hook 1]
We're fragile (wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile (you're not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to (we've been here before)
I don't ever wanna change
I'm fragile
I don't ever

[Verse 2]
With every letter I grow to be better
And show the offender he better remember
He'll never effectively render me dead
Unfettered he's never entering my head
Better quit your mental meddling instead
It's time to face your final fate
Bite it, here is your penalty
I rise this day with eyes ablaze
And I will stay
Fightin', fear is the enemy
You tell me if it's that easy for me to know
Who's L.V. and what does he see you think we don't?
Cluelessly I've been self-leading, oh that's a joke
Foolishly I've been competing in a game I won't
Ever win cause I am not Him, The I Am I'm not
I'll never know it all, so
Guess I had better begin mining my thoughts
In The Highest of rocks
I'd better show it also
It's real, I've had many moments alone in my pad
Penning omens opposing my dad
Focusing on fads, hope that doesn't last
I don't really get why I'm like this
Help me understand
I thought I would be sick, now I feel sick
I guess I am just a man
I'm (fragile)

[Hook 2]
Fragile (wish I'd have known)
I never thought I'd be so fragile (you're not alone)
If it didn't break before, it's about to (we've been here before)
I don't ever wanna change
I'm fragile
I don't ever

[Verse 3]
I'm done holding grudges with myself and others
And trudging along with all of the luggage
Of wrong I've committed, I'm tried and acquitted
I'm tired of livin' deprived of forgiveness
I'm tired of bitterness, I quit, I'm finished
I've got too much sin to try and sit and live with
Alone in this dark, silent position
Violent disposition, I'm tired of livin'
On the fence, on defense
Standin' for nothin' and fallin' for all pretense
After I suffer it's always, “I'll repent”
Not
Too educated to learn my lesson
Opinionated, I sure find rest in
A thing if I made it to serve my intention
Stop, man
This is more than me and this is more than you
And all humanity, so what I'm gonna do
Is take reality into this field of music
Ideality is too unreal to use if
I am just a human, just a seeker
Stronger when I'm weaker, I think I should lose it
I'm a fellow student teachin' through our speakers
Faith and reason are my teacher cause I'm stupid

[Hook 2]
