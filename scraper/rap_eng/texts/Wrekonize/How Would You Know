[Chorus: Wrekonize]
I’ve been so high that I can’t come down
I’ve been so low I’ve been underground
But how would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
I was alone when the sun came down
I was afraid I wouldn’t make it out
Felt so lost now I’m finally found
But how would you know?
Yeah how would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?
How would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Uhuh
It’s been a minute since we last spoke
I feel like we got way up out of key that last note
But I’m still playing though
I heard you’re doing well
That’s really great to know
I wonder if out there you hear us on the radio
Your lady good, your kids good
The fam and 'em?
I haven’t told you, me and wifey talkin' havin' some
I see our chatter has been so scattered it’s sad and tough
But I know that this world is ravenous
It’s super gassed up brethren
Everybody on self-serve
My camera front facing how else can I get self heard?
I thought I got a line from you but then it felt blurred
A fuzzy feeling seeming like texture
My phone ain’t ringing like it used to; friends been vanishing
Seeing them from a window they say nothing like mannequins
How can I keep up when I’m only Instagramming ‘em
And strangers know them just as much as me
I can’t fathom it

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
I’ve been so high that I can’t come down
I’ve been so low I’ve been underground
But how would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
I was alone when the sun came down
I was afraid I wouldn’t make it out
Felt so lost now I’m finally found
But how would you know?
Yeah how would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?
How would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
How would you know?

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Eyo I’m out here trying to function
Through dumb shit
Constant interruptions
Outsider's assumptions
Amateur productions
Backchat on deductions
Singing for my lunches
Dancing for my dollars and earning all my dysfunctions
Momma said I had gumption
Kept the over heads bumping
Kept them talking ‘bout something as long as I’m a discussion
Planning my own destruction while getting the crowd jumping
Fighting the misconceptions and all of the false presumptions
Used to wait for you hoping you would loop around
To the sound
Everything we said went out and did while you run around
City after city playing every big, little town
Everything between here and where we both started out
Opening the bag inside a Van Gogh in the wrong route
Hit the accelerator ‘cause I’ve betted the whole house
Hold out
Hold down
Hope you’ve got your soul on
And yes it’s been a minute if you want to know where I’ve gone

[Bridge: Wrekonize (Crowd)]
Now if you want to know where I’ve been gone
Let me hear you say
How would you?
(How would you?)
If you’re feeling like it’s been too long let me hear you say
How would you?
(How would you?)
If you want to know where I’ve been gone let me hear you say
How would you?
(How would you?)
If you’re feeling like it’s been too long let me hear you say
How would you know?

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
I’ve been so high that I can’t come down
I’ve been so low I’ve been underground
But how would you know?
How would you know?
Oh yeah
I was alone when the sun came down
I was afraid I wouldn’t make it out
Felt so lost now I’m finally found
But how would you know?
How would you know?
