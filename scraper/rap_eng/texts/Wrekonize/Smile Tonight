[Hook]
If there's no god In my sky
If there's no afterlife
It's alright
Let's just do what makes us smile tonight
And If we never survive I won't mind
Let's just do what makes us smile tonight
Tonight
Oh tonight
Let's just do what makes us smile tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Well I been waiting just to get ya to myself like it's only right
I watched the news it's probably true that we could lose our souls tonight
I suggest we just keep on going like it's nothing new
So many things make me smile I'll just start with fucking you
I'm honest to the death supersonic Wrek you want it no modest mouse quiet kept
Scream until you're out of breath
You told me that this life was short and live it up
And now we on the block and rolling hot like we don't give a fuck
We bounced to all them spots you like got you kicks bottoms red
Drank that jack bottle dead, you went down proper head
Well this the life ain't it, good food, good drink, better drugs
See things from a whole different angle
When you been living under rules so smug
I gots to take advantage while everybody panics
Me and my nica princess are drinking Mayan blood
And they all think we savage but as the world do vanish
We speak a different language
See we just smile and shrug
