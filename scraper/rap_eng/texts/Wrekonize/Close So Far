[Chorus: Common Kings]
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
He's looking out a window
Rain tapping on panes to a tempo
Brain caught up in limbo
Screen paused on a game of Nintendo
Little Ben, you were so little then
Didn't even dig a win, you just think of fitting in
Young man with a plan to demand dividends
Not for the love of money for the love of rhythm and
You're seeking every facet now
Rock shows working up in the class now
Started out small, filled like half a lounge
Now you selling out shows line's back around
Sniffed out that scent like a basset hound
Huh, shit
The boy's got imagination and he grinds, no backing down
So when he comes through better ready your congratulations
They said he could, make it, he should
If he only knew how to break and escape from the woods
He's been late to the good, shaking the foot
But he keeps going here and staying in the place that he stood
But he's not there yet
He's still a young kid on the floor just thinking he could be him a star
Singing to the notes of his father's guitar

[Chorus: Common Kings]
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Did it matter at all?
Twenty years turning off the alarm
Did it even make a difference with y'all
Did it hit when I aimed for the heart
Keeping everyone I love in the dark
'Til the music starts
And I'm ripped apart
Never left the jungle so the blade is sharp
We're still savages in a strange amusement park
So tell me what it takes to reach the end
Feel a little bit of joy from what you did
Feel like you didn't waste a thing
Bet it all win and lose in time again
See the trick to the trip is lose your mind
So the bumps in the road will make you smile
I see the end come and count the miles
Hope we're slowing down

[Chorus: Common Kings]
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far
So close so far
Right from the start
So close so far
So close so far
