[Hook: Wrekonize]
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You pulled the rug from under me
I knew this day would come
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
I see you everywhere I go
There's nowhere left to run
But you're done to me
You're so done to me
Look what you've done to me
You're so done to me
Done

[Verse 1: JL]
Yo
You can't see the bigger picture you posin' in
A moment you feel like wasn't supposed to end
Wasting your breath, talking about time to breathe
All that I've done since then is hold it in
Go fill up my cup from the well you poisonin'
Got me lookin' dumb in front of my boys again
I know that you take a L and you learn from it
Still though the repercussions are permanent
You were my purpose, topic of so many verses
Had you in every video, guess I deserve this
Read my face like emoji's, my emotion unavailable
Tried bein' Superman, guess I wasn't capable
No one to blame, I backed myself in a corner
Back to the drawing board, I'm back to the loner
Feel like a heart patient awaiting a donor
Like a wondering lost puppy away from its owner
Yo, we had dead it but I forgot how to live without you
Where was I headed?
I forgot what I did without you
Would have done more for it, don't get what it is about you
I went to war for it, forgetting you is a battle
Yeah, now it's over, hate to say it but it's true
Consequences of it take a toll on you
Did a number on me, what am I to do?
I don't think you even have a clue

[Hook: Wrekonize]
But you're done to me
You're so done to me
Look what you've done to me
You're so done to me
Done

[Verse 2: JL]
The damage is done and love is a broken habit
Left empty handed but carrying so much baggage
I feel like I couldn't hold conversation
You and this concentrate what a combination
Lookin' down from a billboard
Starin' through me from a magazine
Dying for, when I would kill for
Was something I was not imagining
Dream girl in my nightmares
Hauntin' me in my daydreams
Real life like all over
A plus on exposure
Couldn't hide if I wanted to
Everywhere but in my bed
Sick of me, need something new
So please stay out of my head
Used to call me baby than stopped calling altogether
Way too much on my mind for you to be on it ever
For the better bringin' it early into forever
Teary eyed thinking I wished that I never met her
What, why, when, where, and how?
Rebuild if I tear it down
Stuck here if I stick around
My friends are friends now
Pressure on my offense
Offsides no flag thrown
Nothin' left, I'm convinced
Everything we had gone
Tell my family I'm sorry but i'm through
Pack a bag and relocate I gotta move
Only option, there ain't nothin' left to do
Anything to get away from you

[Hook: Wrekonize]
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
You pulled the rug from under me
I knew this day would come
You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done
I see you everywhere I go
There's nowhere left to run
But you're done to me
You're so done to me
Look what you've done to me
You're so done to me
Done
