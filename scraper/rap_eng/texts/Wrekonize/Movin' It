[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Ay, like I got telekinesis, I'm not embellishing, peep it
I move the tail on these pieces they love for me to spit
When it's hot as hell in the creases and they get a little smell in they Secrets
That's when I got a spell on the bitches and it's bugged to see the shit
I gets awfully wicked, saucy and c-cocky with it, hahaha
Sloppy but I beat it up just like Rocky did it - naughty, this is
Papi, pop and socky, stop me for the Heaven nigga drop me
Then I won't get broccoli if a nigga don't rock this party
Hi Ms. Titty Butt, I spit gritty stuff
Try and deny me, it's bye-bye, giddy up
I get many bucks, why get shitty, what!?
I can get any woman anywhere I want it so, mom, why get pity fucked?
Tech N9ne is moving your behind, miss
K-Salaam rocking your shit with Kansas City's finest
Rewind this 'til your mind gets the ibis
We all crunk off inside this, (fighting like we Irish!)

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
We movin' it
We movin' it

[Hook]
Bring the party with me, we run city to city
We come to give the people what they want
Peep the way she doing it, movin' it like she want me to
Take her back to the trailer to...
Bring the party with me, we run city to city
We come to give the people what they want
Peep the way she doing it, movin' it like she want me to
Take her back to the trailer to...

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Yo, believe we movin' it - Tech, Wrek, no confusing it
Bad vibe on your mind, we soothing it
We the best of the game, exuberant
I'm body rocking options like it's nothing, I'm a monster
In the middle of a chromed out Honda
With a little dime piece ramed Rhonda
King Kong of my genre, Fonz to imposters
My mantra is Rasta, four players, antipasto
I'm a patron saint of Patron
Black like painting jack stones
Tennessee squire fires on anybody that's home
I seen her, need to meet her, didn't take much to pursue her
She said "Ain't you that guy that's been singing on my computer?"
Yes, of course I am, don't I seem the perfect suiter?
Then I introduced her hooters to the back seat of my Uber
What you think this is? I'm a king to kids
With every link I spit, I'm on beast mode
You all minor fucks, I got Midas touch
See, everything I damn near speaks gold
I sweet talk and I seek those
Wild women who wanna be slow
With K-Salaam and Beatnick, oh
With the snake and bat, we the complete code!

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
We movin' it
We movin' it

[Hook]
Bring the party with me, we run city to city
We come to give the people what they want
Peep the way she doing it, movin' it like she want me to
Take her back to the trailer to...
Bring the party with me, we run city to city
We come to give the people what they want
Peep the way she doing it, movin' it like she want me to
Take her back to the trailer to...
