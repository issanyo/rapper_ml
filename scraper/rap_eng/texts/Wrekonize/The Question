[Verse 1]
(Everybody struggles for the answer)
But what's the question though?

He paced around in his own self doubt
Twenty-two years deep and he's still unsure
Life's his hospital: twenty-one floors, plenty of sores
One disease free, only less than one cure

Once chance to, seek out why we're all ants
A huge planet of stanzas on rhythm to dance to
He fought depression like cancer, in a maze of chancellors
(Everybody struggles for the answer)

Inside a skyrise, he's tries to buy time
But needs to find why, his paths are a mile wide
He knows, the doctor says terminal
A life sentence, of life, mankind meets vertigo

It's a personal quest, searching for depth
Most people die before seeing the light
But not him though, he's gonna find the solvent
Once and for all know why our lives are one big problem

His wife called him, speaking kinda random
Didn't see the problems, didn't understand them
She said he held her love for ransom
So in return, he would learn, when she took away his damn son

His quest overtook his family life
Playing with a light, he ain't understand how bright
If it's bright enough to make a man miss his own reflection
He's trying to find the answer before he knows the question

[Hook]
One day you'll see we're born so free, it's hard to know
And I hope that when the smoke has cleared, that you'll know where to go
But you must be sure that first the question you can understand cause
One thing's for sure... (Everybody struggles for the answer)

[Verse 2]
She paced around in her own self doubt
Twenty-six years deep and she's still confused
Two kids, bruised ribs, too beat to move
The dark clouds come down whenever he's on booze

Strong chain, daddy used to do the same thing
Beating momma down while she cried in the rain
She fought depression like cancer, in a maze of chancellors
(Everybody struggles for the answer)

Inside she cried, "why?", and tried to fly by
The fact, her jaw cracked and eyes look tie dyed
She knows, but swims in denial
She takes his force with a smile, just like when she was a child

It's a personal quest, searching for depth
Most people die before seeing the light
But not her though, she's gonna find a solvent
Once and for all know why our lives are one big problem

Her mom called her, speaking kinda random
Said that she should leave him, said she couldn't stand him
She said that he was in a trance, and that
She couldn't see abuse put on her daughter and her grandsons

She'd be killed by his hands that night
Thinking it was her fault or a path in life
She was blind enough to not see the worth in her reflection
Hiding from the answer and frightened of the question

[Hook]
