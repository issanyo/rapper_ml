[Chorus: Wrekonize]
Got both hands high on the steering wheel
Got my spirits higher than ever
Had my rearview broken and trampled on
But it's cool I ain't ever felt better
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Now I ain't never coming back to this place again
By the time I'm gone you gone trace some steps
'Bout to sever all of my relationships
'Bout to get it going on a one-way trip
I heard a priest tell there ain't no saving him
A hundred-thousand miles and I still ain't rest
I've got a couple boards 'til I hit the istol
And only lord knows when I rest my head
I went headed to a safe house
Headed out of negative space
Just had a fire sale, look at the flames
My brother asking me in private if I'm insane
I said I never win better please pass the propane
All the rain, late smoking never minding my gauge
I gotten good at disappearing, stepping right out of frame
I need a higher plane, thirty thousand feet into space
But for now I'm on my way

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
Got both hands high on the steering wheel
Got my spirits higher than ever
Had my rearview broken and trampled on
But it's cool I ain't ever felt better
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I had stress on my mind, I did
Got a few dollars on me, not enough to give
I have the setting on me
Surely, driving into the darkness can be so lonely
Well I keep the top down and my spirits higher
I keep the turns wide so the straights seem dire
Has anybody been this way today?
I'm just trying to keep my drive high until the matinee
I break a couple blocks off of that ninety-two
The sugar low so it's bitter but not as bitter as you
I left my cell phone at home, calls ain't making it through
I've been an addict to the game but I'm making my due
If you'll excuse me, I'm trying to ride all night and quite truly
We Californicate and I'm so Hank Moody
I don't know why you're waiting lady if you knew me
You'd know I

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
Got both hands high on the steering wheel
Got my spirits higher than ever
Had my rearview broken and trampled on
But it's cool I ain't ever felt better
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Outro: Wrekonize & Bernz]
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
'Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
