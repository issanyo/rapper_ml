[Verse 1]
Step in to the shoes of a stranger, slow
For a second, for a minute, if you got it
Don't you think it would be great to know
How is it they live?
The problems they got
They can make you feel crazy
Take another look at your life, one-eighty
Get into another mind state, mine maybe
Act like a beast, mouth foam like rabies
This man work a couple double shifts
And can't see his first born
Ex wife tripped and told a judge
That he drinks plenty and sniffs grams
Like damn, it's really come to this, Pam
Now every Saturday he only see his baby girl for like a minute
And change
Supervised visit with a super eye in it
Making sure that he don't get too close to Lorraine

[Pre-Hook]
Now I am not a doctor, ya see I never got my degree
It don't really take much to be proper
But somebody's being brought to their knees
In a world of soap operas and realities that I never believe
It'd be all too free if we all just see what somebody else sees

[Hook]
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one

[Verse 2]
But sometimes I forget and get lost in my zone
Take for granted the wife that I have and the warmth of my home
That's the moment I snap outta that and get back to the fact that I know
That everybody ain't as fortunate
More of us need to remember the world can be cold
People so hateful, so cruel, ungrateful, bitter, and fake too
That's the cold, hard, late truth
We're impatiently waiting to face with a breakthrough
Without seeing half man as your brother
Or that women as your mother
Tell me who do you relate to?
I feel like we're all stars of a one man show
With nobody out there we can play to

[Pre-Hook]
Now I am not a doctor, ya see I never got my degree
It don't really take much to be proper
But somebody's being brought to their knees
In a world of soap operas and realities that I never believe
It be all too free if we all just see what somebody else sees

[Hook]
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one

[Outro]
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one
Everybody got something
I know I ain't the only one
We all feel like running
And I know I ain't the only one
