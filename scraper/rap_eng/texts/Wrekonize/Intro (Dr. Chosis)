[Dr. Chosis]
Ah, come in
Come in, Mr. Miller
Mr. Miller, correct?
My name is Dr. Chosis, but you may call me Psy

We are here today for your cycle therapy session
I want to reasure you before we begin that you, you cannot be made to do anything under hypnosis that you do not want to do
This session will be for exploring your deepest and darkest fears, so you can finally be at peace with them

Now I want you to close your eyes and imagine being in a place where you can feel completely comfortable and secure
I will begin the metronome now

Now let your feet and legs relax. Let your chest relax. Your neck, your shoulders. Feel your entire soul relaxing
You can feel yourself relaxing now. You can feel a heavy relaxed feeling coming over you and as I continue to talk, that heavy relaxed feeling will get stronger untill it carries you into a deep peaceful state of hypnosis

You're sinking down now. Sinking down and shutting down. Sinking down and shutting down
Shutting down completely

Now you're resting comfortably in deep and a peaceful state of sleep. Going deeper and faster. All of the time
Untill I bring you back only accept those suggestions which are for you benefit. And that you are willing to accept

You are completely under state of hypnosis
Good luck
