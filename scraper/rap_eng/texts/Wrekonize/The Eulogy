[Intro (Wrekonize)]
I saw you walking with your new love
I knew it was over (Uh-huh)
But it made me realize one thing (What's that?)
That I just had to get you out of my life

[Verse 1]
I knew from the second I seen you leave the room
That it was better for one of us to be leaving soon
We had some drama, sent messages to your momma
'Bout all of the recent trauma, and how you was in the streets and screaming in your pajamas
I cannot go, another second Wrek was in a pothole
Records on that stop though, fluid you are not so
You packed up your things and rolled
And I was hurt, but I was more glad to see you go
We were not meant to be
It seems so elementary, that two people could be the couple of the century
Transforming every piece of you and every inch of me
But things became worse for both of us eventually, and so we packed it up
We moved around a bit, for years trying to salvage it
But deep inside we found that it was not as easy as alphabets
And, I'm glad to have the peace now, we needed it
Together we were great, but separately just seems to be the trip

[Hook]
Another cold, rainy evening
Another dark, lonely sign
I'm staring up at the ceiling
And thinking you should know tonight
That I'll be wishing you the best of luck
Remembering only the best of us
We had some good times, just you and me
We're moving on, this is the eulogy

[Verse 2]
Mind locked, on the past
See I've been browsing through my Timehop
It's a sublime thought that we would never make it out
About this pine box, your smile could make a spine pop
Your ass can make a dime drop
Compatibility was the small fact that was killing me
Our schedule's never lined up
See, no kind of symmetry
And, that slowly broke us now, brought it 'round
To a level that was so beneath the ground, you had to dig it down
I seen your Pops at the gym, spoke for a moment
About the fam' and everybody sad that we've been broken
He said you got a new dude, but nobody likes him
He said a couple times he even wanted to strike him
I took it all as flattery, that that assault and battery
Was really saying that the family would really rather me
Told him everything must happen for a reason
The world turns into new seasons, and I'll be in

[Hook]
Another cold, rainy evening
Another dark, lonely sign
I'm staring up at the ceiling
And thinking you should know tonight
That I'll be wishing you the best of luck
Remembering only the best of us
We had some good times, just you and me
We're moving on, this is the eulogy
