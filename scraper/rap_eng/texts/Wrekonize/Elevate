[Hook]
Time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time time to elevate (elevate elevate elevate)

[Verse 1]
Yo, grab your passports
Laying the groove
We trained in rap sports, I've been paying my dues
Fresh off the storm tour with AC and them dudes
Two million views, Â¡Mayday! YouTube news
I'm trying to hang like them YouTube fools
And rock spots world wide like you know who
(The name) Wrekonize, no c no g
I'ma stall, last call [?] on me, baby
J.D. and a dash of [?]
Brings [?] clash of soldiers
Call me Ben Shamrock, bash your dome up
And bend back spots until her thighs are froze up, hold up
I keep spitting bars when the tempo hittin'
Kick freestyles for the fate of the fellowship
You need bump, check the trunk when the record hit
Everyday Wrek gon get better [?] shit
So speak clear and watch out for the killas which we go'n be killin' just for the thrill of it
Mad Max step back when splittin' lids fightin' with [?]

[Hook]
Time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time time to elevate (elevate elevate elevate)

[Verse 2]
Runnin' through paint might taint my welfare
But who the hell can't when my saint is elsewhere
I'm locked in the studio
I'm [?]
I'm lighting fireworks  that [?] pops sees
Was the epitome of fuckin' [?]
Until they got me in the hamster wheel running for my entrance fee
That's just the name of the game ain't it
I never ran so I guess I'm gon stay and play it
Speak clear and watch out for the uprise
I waited long enough and now its time to give up lines
Each month I get stronger like [?] son
I follow new schedules and [?] next ones

[Hook]
Time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate
Time, time to elevate (elevate elevate elevate)

[Outro]
What did he do
What he do
What she do
What we do
What it do
This is Grandmaster Larceny and you know what it is motherfuckers
Elevator music
