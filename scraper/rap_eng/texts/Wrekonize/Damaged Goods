[Verse 1: Bernz]
If it wasn't for my son
The moon would have never fell
And I ain't even done, I just hide it well
Every day I run, but I don't know where
Empty out my lungs
Fill 'em up with smoke-filled air
Playing Russian roulette with ten different men
Locked in my head trying to run for the fence
Killing time 'til I get to a place where it kills the things that keep me paying rent
I'm a slave to the things I do when they turn their back man I need to repent
Lately I've been meditating and praying to God every other day but it ain't make a dent
Devil in disguise, Angel in they eyes
I'm just trying to get a ride to the next spot
I ain't even say shit no more
I keep to myself 'cause I only scream at the small thoughts
Give a little but take more
So much that I'm sore from the handouts every time my arms drop
You've been trying to find peace
I'm out in these streets
Trying to make up for negative karma
How does it feel to sleep every night
With your dreams out of sight
For a piece of the pie?
How does it feel to see me and think
Yo that could have been me but I ran for my life?
I've been trying to stay up through the downs
I've been up in the clouds so long can't land
And these rhymes in my pad are more than just songs that I write for the fair-weather fans

[Chorus: Bernz & Wrekonize]
Damaged
Damaged goods
Damaged
Damaged goods
Damaged
Damaged goods

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Yeah
I've been down this road before
But every time that I drive it I can't seem to find it
It's like I love this pain in my vein, if I don't then I might need a little more reminding
I'm blinded
By the business I'm in, by the tint of my skin, by my signage
By the fact there's a million motherfuckers out doing double with only a half of my vibrance
Quite silent
Quite cold, quite calm, quite bomb, quite gone, quite riding
For somebody with a raincloud on 'em
You don't lay rounds on 'em; that's a real bright lining
And you're shining
And your cadence is cut
But you're jaded as fuck like Nolan
It's been tainted enough to be made into crust
And be fed 'til it humbles your pie and
Young brother with a dumb-luck oner
I'mma run up on you
You don't need to be seen now
Bloodsucker with a one-up on us
Get a gun bust sucker
Then be gone in the steam now
You got means now
But they under a world full of greed now
Everybody want to be the one to have freedom run
But they can't speak proud for the peace now
