They tryna to fire up like North Korean missiles
Through the bone gristle
But none they poems hit you in this world of cloned tissue
Wrek is high grade, boom bap
Taken from the underground
That boy got them lyrics please make sure that you do shut him down
They do not approve of my bars they do humble g's
Everybody honeyed up, I'm allergic to mumble bees
But i keep it moving the illusion is so jumbled these
Idiots have got me underrated
I've been barred up since back when Charlie won that golden ticket
Rubbing charm over scars, it ain't hard to overthink it
But I love this life
I'm cutting through the zombies
I love this game so much I live inside it like Jumanji
Now is that an older reference, or has it now been modernized?
Reboots and remakes subdue most of the common minds
Underneath distraction we can find a world to colonize
These vices and these devices shorten modern lives (huh)
I grind like I ain't had an accolade
They say that they grind, but check the time they working half the days
Said that they were monsters, colossal like a hand grenade
But they as hard as an alcoholic Anne Hathaway
This planet's baking armageddon, but thank the Donald
We are in a nation of forgetting
Forget the pain and you can just forget the day it set in
The paper screams we are fucked but no one reads the heading
Whats the plot and prognosis besides cirrosis
Super cal Fragile Wrek be a la dope shit
Bigging up these wannabe emcees up above me
Who been standing on my bars to sell it out Coyote Ugly
I've been on the run since I was a hushpuppy
Gaining things from grind nah I never was lucky
Building up the wreking crew to stand against the fluffies
And try to keep my day ones from turning into bucky's
What you think this is, a life of leisure and some fuckin' game?
That draws us just inside the lines that keep us up and sane
I've seen some people living in the streets and stuck in pain
And don't know to think if they might be the ones to blame
This world has turned my heart colder then the Himalayas
But I feel like I need to mobilize like demonstrators
And if I don't move now I think they'll dim the faders
And turn it down so no one can even attempt to save us
I will not be the sucker in some motherfuckers favor
And turn a blind eye while they come out and buck my neighbor
This movement is independent, but the stakes are kind of major
And it requires work, but we never did mind the labor
Got fam who laced up so I guess this one is a rager
I'm 'bout to retrogress so if you need me hit the pager
I got no time in my mind to become your savior
But warriors come out at night and play if that's your flavor
My flavors cake and tonic, they favor hate and vomit
They could just pay the homage or, save for Reaganomics
I carry blades and onyx and work for pay from sonnets
This data it mnemonic and ultra laced in chronic
So we burnin' to the fourth degree
Cause if it ain't brute force then it ain't force to me
I'm feelin' this from head to toe, my soul, and in my knees
This music industry is fuckin' me like birds and bees
But I still love her though, I do whatever that she needs
And tell my friends I must have fell so just excuse me please
This thing is life or death, mics are checked through the leads
And galleries hate on you cause you let the groove repeat
But I will never make excuses for my service, or apologize for the art like Com's Electric Circus
I will be the truth from my roots to the surface
And keep it in the dungeon makin' motherfuckers nervous

[Outro]
Pardon me committing murder
And cutting ties with any virus linking to your servers
I just know how to be me
And never can I perjure
In nine days I do invite you all Into the Further
