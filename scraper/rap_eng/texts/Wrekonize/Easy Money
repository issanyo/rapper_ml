[Intro]
Yeah, I know you
You from that, you from that group, right?
I've seen y'all going all around the country and shit
Y'all got it poppin' right now, shit
How does it feel to blow up, man?
You got that easy money, shit

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Lemme get my grind on I been moving like a cyclone
Through the years keep my rhyme strong
All to eat and keep the motherfucking lights on
What your problem is shit we got jobs
Will saying that they just high profile
Speaking to eat and keeping the street
Under your feet whenever kids
Are trying to beef cause they got no style
I see you touring the show making the thickest of women get low
Must be the shit so motherfucking legit
To get a grip from the hip exit get the dough
Shit I got boo coo fees to relieve
I ain't free still gotta pay taxes
Still gotta meet Uncle Sam's demand
And god damn still hide a couple stacks under the mattress
What you think this is?
You really think I got balls in the lotto
You think I got a money tree full of leaves
And I bleed out green got a cellar full of bottles?
This is life ain't it? Money come money go cause it quite tainted
All nuttin' but a thing cause it ain't really

[Hook]
No such thing as easy money
I don't care what they say
No such thing as easy money
I don't care what they say
No such thing as easy money
Still I spend it away
Let 'em hate, easy money
I don't care what they say
There's no such thing as easy

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Money will come and go quicker than the air that's gets up into your lungs
Breathing heavier than normal and it's steady for months
My lady just wanna see me more than a second for once
It's a fucked up game full of pain huh we all working through the process
My conditioning's conditioned cause I'm steady on a mission
For the better life and getting all these objects obsessed
What a life, we all paying a price to be bathed in the light
I been wanting to know if you feeling alien tonight
Cause I never really seem to feel that safe in the sights
Wall Street fucks with they suit and the tie
Getting bread but to get it they be losing they pride
Always kept cool even when they ruin my tide
I've always envied those who just came out to shoot at the sky
I been hustling since I was old enough to get a buck
And live up to the meaning of a dollar
Got a job pushing shopping carts and taking bullshit
From a jacked up douche in a collar
Huh I was 15 acting like the money would be better
For the status of my karma
But nothing's easy and I keep telling my momma

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
See everybody wanna be the man
With the master plan that's on the top
They want the cars, want the clothes
Want the broads and the bottles to pop
But when ya sittin' out on the throne
Laid back chillin' being the king
With the watch and the chain and the pinky ring
You better watch your back for all the hate it bring
See everybody goon love yo ass
When you broke as a joke and you not a threat
But soon as you get that bread and you start turning heads
Watch how jealous they get
When your status is elevated
You kind of made it and you get some change
If they don't get what they think they suppose to get
Then motherfuckers start acting strange
Pointing fingers, talking down
Acting funny when you come around
Next thing you know you the talk of the town
Use to have a smile, now you got a frown
You ain't know that's the price of fame
And that's what it cost to be in this game
You better be built for it or stay in your lane, mayne

[Hook]
