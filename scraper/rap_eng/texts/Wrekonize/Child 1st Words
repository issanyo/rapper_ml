[Intro:Wrekonize]

So the sun rises, on the dawn of a new era
And our young squire is presented with a seed
To carry out the blood-line he may not be able to complete
And the towns folk just stood in awe
They had no name for this child
No title for the birth they had just witnessed
So the child sat up and began to speak for himself and said:

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I'm the alphabetic accelerator, set the data test the fate a'
Bless the innovata' hate the fakers like I'm suppose ta'
Over the ghost of coal so rose the most
I hosted roast the boast, I'll never cross over
Promote the post-it jokes my dose will choke
The emcees' out for the bread and to the toaster
I scold the stiff neck and cold shoulder
Rolling over your rover turn over your style cloner
The one you picked up off an 8-mile poster
You lose your face value when you play the wild joker
Bluffing and stuffing this running out of your roaster
Shooting for the stars wile I'm a big bang bolder
Hulk hulkster like you got a gun in that holster
We all know the truth is exposed when we get closer
Close the freak show, your weak flow just seems broker
Your vibe's slower than ride the Ms. Daisy chauffeur
Sold your soul for souls to run-amuck of most of
Hip-hop do's and don'ts, the dues are growing lonesome
Cus' you ain't paid none yet debt holder
Irreverent, evident, it's eminent to wreck's soldiers
So heed the words of the child like cobra
Sitting up in his pram in a wild style pose up
Beets, rhymes, and life is what my mind's composed of
Here pushing it out until my outlet close up

These are the first words...
Of a child...
Born into a kingdom...
Where kicks and snares is justice
