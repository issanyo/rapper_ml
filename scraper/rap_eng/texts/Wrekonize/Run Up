[Hook: Wrekonize]
When the sun goes down, the hustlers gon' come up
Watch your step or they'll steal your whole summer
Don't go around there wearing the wrong color
'Cause if you do, you might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
They'll steal your whole summer (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
Watch your back

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Get to running in your den
This is no game, no shame, no brains, no fame safe for the hung
They be out here wilin' violent fucking on y'all for the fun
And these streets go silent all of a sudden ain't nobody see nothin'
And your body goes numb, 3, 2, 1
They been out here now looking for your chains to grab
You resist and you find that your brains detached
They got a 100 motherfuckers all aimin' at ya
With a claim to capture, all maniacs on these streets
Now hop off the boat and bogart looking like me
And the wolves ain't never passed up on the sheep so

[Hook: Wrekonize]
When the sun goes down, the hustlers gon' come up
Watch your step or they'll steal your whole summer
Don't go around there wearing the wrong color
'Cause if you do, you might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
They'll steal your whole summer (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
Watch your back

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Better know what part of town you're in
When the men in the mood begin to grin
Better have a good reason that you're in
Leaving when the street lights begin to blink
See the writing on the wall like what you think
And the music in the distance ain't ya thing
Better get what you came for
When the same doors you came through will lock your ass out
No exceptions, no reception, one way in and just one exit
Once that taboo was so infectious
But if I was you I'd change directions
Because if they do start with questions
Then ain't go showing your mentions
Now they ain't gon' know where to send it
When them boys 'round out but unexpected
Nah they won't know

[Hook: Wrekonize]
When the sun goes down, the hustlers gon' come up
Watch your step or they'll steal your whole summer
Don't go around there wearing the wrong color
'Cause if you do, you might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
They'll steal your whole summer (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
Watch your back

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Some are feeling like Saigon
My city give you lead to try on
If you lightweight like Nylon
Get a one-way ticket to your Zion
Babylon, either one son
You don't wanna be defeated when the gun come
Get your lungs done, 'til your plum numb
It's like a 12 with a 30 round drum drum
What is the weather in K City? (Heated)
What do you say when you way gritty? (Eat it)
The prevailing bullets, you got the pedal and couldn't
We by the devil and hooded when they pity (feed it)
Chop chop 'til your Glock stops
Get your box locked when the sun up
3 to block knots like I'm Basquiat
30 ought shot when they run up

[Hook: Wrekonize]
When the sun goes down, the hustlers gon' come up
Watch your step or they'll steal your whole summer
Don't go around there wearing the wrong color
'Cause if you do, you might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
They'll steal your whole summer (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
You might just get run up (run up)
