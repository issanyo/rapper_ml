[Verse 1]
Cameras at the stoplight cameras in my MacBook
Catch us when we not right don't miss it just stop look
How long do you think it take for me to break through to you fucking bastards
Till you realize who's in control they are the puppet masters

In a place where we are free
Quotations on the free
They be having us believe
That we don't cause them to heed
Where we go and who we see
Who we screw and where we be
But they track all of our needs what type we bleed it's a disease I
Walk with
A twitch and I'm overly sick but they brought me to this I'm
Paranoid
Got me a pit just to walk to the bridge get me off of this shit it's
A master ploy
They just call me manic causing static can it that's the noise
They will watch you sleep they got cams up on the mother fucking asteroids
Webcam with a so called model
Boot it up and get your social in
Barcodes on all my bottles
Keep tracking me and all my friends
Sending me into a aftershock so pad the box
With master locks
And trash it while I stash the plot
I hear the robins scan the block
That ain't just ghetto speak the eyes are wide around the planet
Cloak and dammit different language multi angle vantage
How long do you think it take for me to break through to you fucking bastards
Till you realize who's in control they are the puppet masters

[Hook]
There they go there they go
In the dark they roll in shadows
There they go there they go
They'll take your bows and arrows
There they go there they go
They eyes up on the sparrow
But I know they'll make u think
Ya mind is playing tricks on ya
Ya mind is playing tricks on ya
It's Playing tricks
How long do you think it take for me to break through to you fucking bastards
Till you realize who's in control they are the puppet masters

[Verse 2]
I speak only in morse code i whisper till the doors closed
Watching for the pork show and they maybe bugging your clothes
So for sure go to war when the floor holds torsos
Bodies on the ground from the politicking now
What u want some mercy
Be ready for the jump when they better with the pump and they want to hurt me
I been severing up from every etiquette of not even medical love cuz you can never even trust
Those men up in the club who pretend to protect you gon end up Xerses
LED's see these alarms are silent
But some things stilll remain their sole response is violent
I'm digging for the clues the mayday music does the mining
We speak conspiracies and spiritually unearth the diamond
For the ones in the dark who are scared to be seen by the drones they pilot
And the ones who refuse to open up their eyelids
How long do you think it take for me to break through to you fucking bastards
Till you realize who's in control they are the puppet masters

[Hook]
There they go there they go
In the dark they roll in shadows
There they go there they go
They'll take your bows and arrows
There they go there they go
They eyes up on the sparrow
But I know they'll make u think
Ya mind is playing tricks on ya
Ya mind is playing tricks on ya
It's Playing tricks
How long do you think it take for me to break through to you fucking bastards
Till you realize who's in control they are the puppet masters

[Bridge]
Am I insane am i losing all my sense and everything from which i came
Did i see that shadow move or was it all up in my brain
They say I need their meds to check my head because I'm strange
I swear i seen those puppets what the fuck this ain't a game

[Hook]
