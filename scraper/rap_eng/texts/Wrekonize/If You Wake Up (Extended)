If you wake up and find your world is not the place you once thought, you'll find you're not alone(X3)

No, no, no(X7)

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I've been an ironsight on the iron maiden for five years pacing
Daydream highperspacing, violation
Ending up out of fazing, breaking through radiation
Give me a recreation in my own little basement
And I'll be fine here, stationed
With my eyes on the other side of the last temptation
Been rearranging, changing segregation
Basing our retaliation on their invasion
Change rhyme scheme, increase to advance
The rain finds me, it seems it's the last chance
Some nights I still down one too many
But without a sip the world just don't seem that friendly
Is there anybody out there any
That ain't just chasing down a crown made of pennies
I found an orphan laying underneath a crown vic
He grabbed my shirt, pulled me close to the ground, said
Have you ever seen a lost child in a tin can
I've been up at night trying to wash away my sins and
All the air waves, nowadays, are seeming thin, damn
I remember better than them songs that have been playing
Shiiiiit
The sounds better than gold
It's never the bold getting left in the cold
It's the decent, death fearing folk
Country time smiling
Running from the smoke on a hundred mile island
I've been trying to find them
But the nuclear horizon has got me feeling oh so blinded
I keep it positively minded, roped up and binded
Cause there's no way to knock me off of my trip
