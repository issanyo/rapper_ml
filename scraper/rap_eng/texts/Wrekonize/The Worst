[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
On the side, but your main chick tried to hate?
Let me tell you a story about my situation
I got caught up with this chick from a radio station
The thirteenth caller won a ticket to my show
At night is where I saw her there in the front row
She had big D cups and a very small waist
I looked into her eyes and wondered how did she taste
She came backstage to take a flick for the 'Gram
She whispered in my ear and put my dick in her hand
She said, "Do you have plans for later on tonight?"
I said, "Yes ma'am, but I sort of have a wife"
She looked and said, "I know"
I said, "But what does that mean?"
She said, "I know means I know how not to be seen"
My mind said no, but my body said yep
So I probably put my number in her phone before she left

[Hook]
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger

[Verse 2]
Now she sliding in my DMs
AM and the PM
Delete, delete, delete
Because my girl don't need to see them
And every time I see her
It makes me want to leave her
Caught between these two chicks
I don't know which I prefer
I told her, "You don't know how powerful you is
With just one text you destroy all of this
My kids, my wife, my life, my home
All of this is gone with just a message from your phone
I said, "Think we should cut this off before it all goes sour
Because no side chick should have all this power"
I rolled out of my bed and hopped into the shower
And I was at her house in less than an hour
I was such a coward, I was so confused
I let it all continue because I didn't want to choose
And that's how you lose everything you ever dreamed of
Dudes out there takes this message here from me cause

[Hook]
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger

[Interlude: Murs & (Woman)]
Do you know how I feel about you?
(No)
No?
(No)
I love you, but I also love my wife
Can, can, can you not text me in front of my wife?
(Yes)
Do you text me in front of my wife on purpose?
(No)
No?
(No, I really don't)
Are you sure?
(No, I'm positive)
So you want me to get a divorce?
(No, no)
No?
(Absolutely not)
No?
(No)
Do you want to be with me?
(Hmm, no)

[Hook]
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger but
You, you, you bring the worst out of me, me, me
Baby why can't you see, see, see
What the fuck is going on with us
I wish I was stronger
