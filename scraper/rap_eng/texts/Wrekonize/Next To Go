[Intro]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

[Verse 1: Bernz]
I hope you packed well for your trip
Better hope you plan right for your travel
Better do it soon cause it could be the choice between kingdom and castle
Gonna have some nights you rush to bed
Gonna have some days you wish were dead
Gonna get some rough terrain ahead
But any other way of life is walking dead
I contend, so just plug the aux and send
Turn it up until the ride begins to wind down
Better enjoy us out your hands now
Go on and make noise before we shut down
Because one second they say you the shit
Live long enough and you're what they detest
So don't let it all come back around
Once again it just be what they came to expect
Remember I said

[Hook: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You won't know 'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
Now you don't know 'til you're next to go
You won't know 'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
Now you won't know 'til you're next to go

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I been here so long that I know
That my souls a bit hard to find
I been off road and came back stronger
I been at home and felt that long divide
I got places to go
Ima be a big big deal coming in with a case full of dough
I be grateful to know that this world won't leave me to live here waiting to waste it alone
Made moves, shook hands, sacrifice
Work nights sky went from black to white
Back on to the grind cause that's my vice
No backup can't just afterlife
So I better move, better go
I been running for a minute trying to cruise at a tone
Every time I test limits I'm betting to be the biggest
But somebody once told me that you do never know
What they said

[Hook: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You won't know 'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
Now you don't know 'til you're next to go
You won't know 'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
'til you're next to go
Now you won't know 'til you're next to go
