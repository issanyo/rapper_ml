[Verse 1: Bernz]
Are you in the game or are you watching from the sidelines?
Are you in the kitchen whipping entr√©es or the side items?
Fighting for some peace or just a piece of someone's pie slice
Man I want to know, I gots to go, I'm on my timeline
Do you like to talk, or do you listen for the highlights?
Live fast, die young, or age like a fine wine
This all up to you, I'm just enjoyment for the long ride
Plus I gots no place I gots to go

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I'm checkin' in to build like hotel renovations
So what's the occasion?
I'm Bordain in this nation and still have no reservations
So we can link together an ignore this stormy weather
I got cabin fever, grab me the refer, cause for celebration
Miyagi's out at Ocean, Plexo down in Hialeah
We can catch the Heat, I got the plug for love at the arena
I got y'all on the first round, this mezcal's doing work now
The world is ours, so let me know your game

[Hook: Wrekonize]

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Ain't no use in slowing down, you know it's gonna be a long night
Up this late at night, they won't turning on no strobe lights
I be getting high with high society and low-lifes
I be on my vibes and talking shit to you the whole ride
Are you ready or are you walking with a slow stride
Come on, hurry up, you know the party's gon' be so tight
Every time we walk into a room, you know we gon' shine
So what you tryna do, man yo, just hit me on the phone line

[Verse 4: Wrekonize]
Yeah, I've been here holding the whole time
Waiting for you to come online
Waze your ETA , so I'm outside whenever you roll by
The night is just beginning even though it's late for most
We just need them choices then let's put it to vote
I'm feeling that maybe this night could be amazing if we play these cards correctly
Cause Miami vices love me and the guardians protect me
It's nothing but a thang to me if I'm out with the crew
See the world is our's, they'll have it when we're through

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Tell me what you want to (Do)
Do
(Do, Do)
What y'all tryna (Do)
Do
(Do, Do)
Tell me what you want to (Do)
Do

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
I'm thinking we could do this, we could do that
And every night we do this, till we lose track
You know I'm always down to turn up, never turn back
So what you tryna do, do, do
I'm thinking we could do this, we could do that
And every night we do this, till we lose track
You know I'm always down to turn up, never turn back
So what you tryna do, do, do
