[Verse 1:]
In the middle of the night
Voices creep up on me like
(What you wanna do tonight?)
I don't know, I don't feel too right
'Cause there's people on the TV
And I swear that they can see me
'Cause everything I do, they do it just alike, like
(Like what?)
I haven't lost it right? (nah)
These stranger things ain't change they sting
This wall ain't lost its lights
My riders win and own ya (word)
Your riders like Winona (huh)
My lines are meant for stoners and drinkers with inked personas (haha)
Another shot straight from Oaxaca
I could stop lock like a mean popper
They just shot block like they Ibaka
I just keep on cause I'm programmed
Like a good ol' fashioned teen bopper
But I'm still stuck in this dream locker
I don't know nuttin'' but to be proper, man

[Hook] [x2]
In the middle of the night
I stay up late and I write
(Why you stay up all night?)
I don't know, it just feels so right
'Cause there's people feeling sleepy
And they been resting easy
But everything I do I do it
In the middle of the night

[Verse 2:]
Night time is the right time
To get you a couple of them lifelines
I been on the night train since 9 9
Having brunch with the goblins
I mean birds have been super for the gobbling
Digest and I'm ready for the problems
That we all in
When the sun comes right back up and there ain't no stoppin'
Break bread
Matter of fact go ahead break eggs
Cause when your family is gathered around in the pantry
I'll probably just stay dead
That's my steez if you must make beds
Make 'em around me or make late check
Imma be the guy that you can't wake yet
Only been asleep since the bass faded
I been chasing the dreams outta every day
Just to find me the right night line
And if you can't get sleep 'cause you hearin' the beats
Then you might have a life like mine
Life goes fast, takes things slow
Time does pass, grey hairs grow
I can't grasp where I can go
Unless I see the stars, so

[Hook] [x2]
In the middle of the night
I stay up late and I write
(Why you stay up all night?)
I don't know, it just feels so right, 'cause
There's people feeling sleepy
And they been resting easy
But everything I do I do it
In the middle of the night
