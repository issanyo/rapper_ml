[Intro]
Yeah, peace to the Diamond District
Vegas family
Don't, don't stop, don't stop the
Don't stop the music

[Verse 1]
Hey yo my daddy played the blues
My mama was his muse it
Seems a bit poetic when you look at how i use it
Straining in Miami but I never let it choose which
Avenue to lose grip handles smooth cool whip
I'm diplomatic to a fault
I gather all my thoughts up in an attic in my vault
You can open up my wound and you line it up with salt but
(Don't stop the mu, mu, music )
Ok, Hollywood raised, hello Montaro
It seems as though times fired on the wrong arrow
I wanna dive deep but some say the ponds shallow
But it felt like an ocean to me
I wanna be taking the high road to Cairo to scribe hieroglyphics
Walk around the globe twice dip in the pacific
I'll do anything to put you at ease but oh please just
(Don't stop the mu, mu, music )

[Hook]
Look at us and the things we've done
You can't tell me the wars been won
Can't stop songs just begun
Don't stop the mu, mu, music
Some people run
Some fight for fun
Even when it begun
So don't stop the mu, mu, music

[Verse 2]
Check it out
I'm walkin' down the thirteenth on Wash
Hoodie's shed skin when the burn season starts
Miami got the woman that will turn demon hearts
When I heard heathen sparks, it sure beats the swamps
Or the Bronx, and chill I ain't knocking
Where all of y'all are from I just prefer the humid option
Hispanicle culture, heat damnin' that's ultra
Beats bangin' to coast in this land of the vulture
It's a hypocritical mass that keeps us finishing last
But living it up to laugh why won't ya
Wish your neighbour well when he's on your block
Cause when he leaves and your hot and he's gone and you're not
You fucking haters ain't got no nerve and if I went by your word
I might as well leave just with the snowbirds
But back to Canada just snap your camera
And keep a can of this and real fucking stamina
(If your man enough)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I was born in a dream to speak for the mute
Torn from the skin to unleash another nuke
Upon the people who have no i-fucking-dea how to shoot
The white roots are poison the antidote is truth
The antidote is youth if you teach 'em how to learn
The future of our food plants the weakness in our sperm
Fahrenheit risen' I can see the books burn screamin'
(Don't stop the mu, mu, music )
Okay, walk with me a moment if the evil is upon us
I've been keeping up the tone
And now I think that all the audiences
Is upward from the morning it's been time for the warning
Get 'em down for the crowning kill 'em all get 'em on the STOP!
Breathe a moment back to ground zero
Walk around the rubble to hatch the sound hero
I can live without a lot of things
A simple man here but
(Don't stop the mu, mu, music )
C'mon

[Hook]

[Outro]
You can fill me with respect
I still couldn't trust you
They askin' who's next, I'm screaming back fuck you!
You can pretend you got respect
I still couldn't trust you
They askin' who's next, I'm screaming back fuck you!
