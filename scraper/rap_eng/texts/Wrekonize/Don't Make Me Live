[Verse 1: Killbook]

This world like the light
That passes through our sight
With the violence that all fades away

With our bullshit aside
And our love that resides
In our hearts without night time delay

Without all the lies
We can see the pure light
That guides to the peace that we crave

And once we arrive
We now sleep in the sky
Until the clouds become our grave

Now back to the day
Back to the day that we would all pray
Pray for a change with no hope to date
Pray for the games to all go away
Pray for the flames so we could hooray
But we sit here praying
But do nothing to change

Hatred and evil takes part of the play
Part of the ways that we all go insane
And change the world so much
That it can't be the same

Because our impatiences
It gets the best of we
Till it gets the lessening
Of our societies
Humane desire and unfolds
The darker me
That follows the shadows
To aid in the battles
That wage with the
Lies and the truth

Pain, I was force fed
To wish I was dead
So my fragile head
Can rest in it's bed
So I beg you with no regret
Don't make me live

[Hook - Wrekonize]

Don't make me live! (x4)
Don't make me... live

[Second Verse - Killbook]

Pull it together, man
You can do better than
The bullshit that you preaching about

You dissing life
Without the light
To guide you away from the fight

And now your hurting
Feeling of burning
The passion of hatred takes flight

But don't give in
Don't stop livin'
And please come back to the light

Think of your little girl!
Think of the beautiful world
That never gave up on you!

Think of the happiness!
Imagine the sorrowful feeling is gone again
Don't think of the world without the light

Just imagine the sight of all the white
And shun the black!
Vanquish the demons that try to come back!

You're better than that!
Jack, pull it together before you get slapped!
And live on this planet and learn to relax!

If you want a change
Then don't pray for a change
You need to be the change

Or bitter will come
Without a sun
And nowhere to run
To get the fun
Now you don't wanna live?
Then don't let me die!
