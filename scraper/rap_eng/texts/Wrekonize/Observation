[Intro]
One day during meditation training
I rose to a plain where there was utter silence
I was bathed in light and suddenly time and space didn't exist
Only absolute radiance
So wonderful I could not understand why the master had not share it
Then I felt... Enlightened?
No because I did not sense the overwhelming bliss that one should feel
I felt that... it was something like despair but greater
And it had sorrow so intense I could not take it
I could not go on, I failed
Something was saying return to the addict

[Verse 1]
The international, unstoppable, immortal rhyme scholar
Emcees nowadays they run around spittin' shit just to make a dollar
Never made much sense to me, guess it's not in my heart
Once your soul is for sale this is no longer art
I push around a cart full of common sense in the dark
You don't need skill to make it big, ask Bubba Sparxxx
The trouble starts, between lack of skill and a trap door
I'm kickin' rappers off the Dilated People's platform
My omnicity is obvious not to the average eye
My shattered skies, where my retired dreams will lie
Walk up to the foundation of life, I'm kickin' down the pillars
To stop our people from raisin' tomorrow's new born killers
Two long winters, and a maze of summer times
See more tragedy in front of me, I kick another rhyme
Leavin' my brain bleedin' throughout the four seasons
Receivin' the proceedings of my cerebrum then I'm retreatin' and this evenin'
Will be the last sunset you witness
Rippin' this track apart like cartilage and strength fitness
My shit list, seem like it's grown to a mile long
As I pile on stress to test my nerves and icons
I'm like a python who lays patient in the night
I await and observe my prey way before I strike
