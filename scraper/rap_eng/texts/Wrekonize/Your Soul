[Hook]X2
Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same
'till the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold

[Verse 1]
Another year and I've been ready so ready to be back up on my bullshit
Got the Morse Coders bootin' up for battle like we never even planned to leave the bull-pit
What you doing?
What you planning for?
You got a dream? Better wait for it
'Cause I'mma show these people something now
And I know that they've been waiting for it
Bang, but I've been aiming for the Badlands now
Took hiatus did an album out in badman town
Fast cell, but i need more backhand sound
To the face of any nay-say I'm back and crowned
Give me space, give me peace, give me room to climb
On the radio you might of heard a tune of mine
That's progress, nothin' like water to wine
'Cause I've been trying to reach prime now for quite some time
I've been coast to coast on a mission to coast
Spread love through the clefts of these imminent notes
Through the people on the road and they feedin' their soul
Exchange smiles and a hug feelin' regal you know
Gotta lot of road behind, just as much in front
In the middle of a journey I can just take once
And I can travel many miles in a matter of months
So I plan to take full advantage
So let's just toast to life and it's ups and downs
Lost friendships crashed out and sunken now
At the bottom of a pile tryin' to climb back out
And I'm just wondering how we ever even got background
This a place where the path is an open door
Once you see it you'll be begging to be back some more
From the center of this rock to envelop the shores
This is a message from my soul to yours

[Verse 2]
Another year and I've been ready so ready to be back up on my bullshit
Got the Morse Coders bootin' up for battle like we never even planned to leave the bull-pit
Still lookin' for the answers
No matter where they might come from
And if you ever hear them blasters
Then you know you need to run, run
Run for the hills and them sky like rooftops
I'm bangin' on tabletops knockin' my boom box
From Kingston, out into the farthest of boondocks
We kingdom for thinkin like a few won new plots
This is just a view that I can't soak in
Need to see it in return to get me that broked in
I've been picking up methods from my dusty past
And dust them off brand new, check the function dad
I've been coast to coast on a mission to coast
Spread love through the clefts of these imminent notes
Through the people on the road and they feedin' their soul
Exchange smiles and a hug feelin' regal you know
Gotta lot of road behind, just as much in front
In the middle of a journey I can just take once
I can travel many miles in a matter of months
And I plan to take full advantage
