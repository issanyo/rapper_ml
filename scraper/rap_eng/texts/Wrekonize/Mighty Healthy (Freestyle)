[Intro]
Yep, I can definitely feel
The ground shifting below me now
And I'm not quite sure what it is
But something's definitely changin'

[Verse]
If you need me to be demon this evening I will be bleeding
The weak until it's defeated and pleading for me to break ground
Jacking beats just to see them scatter
Now every freestyle I birth could grow up to be a legal matter
Well lemme nurse it then feed my son a little roughage
Flipping raw hipster blogs don't wanna give us coverage
Well just gimme the gavel I'm banging the hammer below
Taking the laminate out of my clothes
Just to get back in the saddle and go (go go)
I don't regret the past with Roc-A-Fella
Cause today my a capellas chop letters
Into half chewed mozzarella
They can rock the bells I rock em redder
And fry words similar to Heisenberg, clearly my toxins better
So if you need me to be the heathen for reasons
You cannot even believe in I'm leaving the field scattering
My brain is bubbling and feeling none of the suffering
I'm loving the buzz I got from crossing the bridge at the gathering
Lemme get a sec to gather up my intellect and interject
When they say we too wordy when in effect
We too fucking advanced crossing through the badlands
You gon' make us tap dance I'm loading up last chance
I'm at the show when rappers swear that they got crazy skills
But then rock over overdubs we call 'em training wheels
Selling CDs with the label peeled
I know pre-schoolers that got a better mind on how to pay the bills
I kidnapped your A&R cause he plays safer
Made him eat a bag of shit now I think he's a taste maker
Props to those support us in the game
The dharma of dope I speak in the sermons domain
Ashley outrageous 57th ave I'm on
Hometown rockin' the 305 dot com
This is no fucking joke when we all got mouths to feed
And need to survive on more than an ounce of weed
These free verses are therapy pardon me letting loose
Cause if I don't it's quite possible that I'll write a second noose
And charge it to the game cause I just want some change back
Bought the kiddies a snake and bat now that's a Strange match
We'll be notorious for penning words so glorious
They'll say we had an unfair advantage Oscar Pistorius
So cop it for the indie boys
I see the thrift store halo on your head majors are vintage noise
This is three of four so fuck leaving even scores
You can wish me grievance if not trying to hear from me no more
This is for the fans the ones who put Wrek on they flesh
And those who think I suck but still got heart enough to show respect
Benny Buckingham sniffing rhymes to max the flow
And light it up for every single ghost I know that's trapped below
