Drive thru', deep fried, bitch that's what you want
Drive thru', deep fried, bitch that's what you want
Drive thru', deep fried, bitch that's what you want
That's, that's, what you want, that's, that's, what you want

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Set your timers on quickfast, nukin' up the drama
Generation microwave, shit is gettin' hotta'
Home-cooked meals used to be my alma matta'
But my momma' can't cook when her stove ain't workin' proppa'
I've been fed with a little more G-M-O's
Keep me feelin' like I need to go
Eat it fast, receive it slow
We should know, that even what they feed us now
Ain't comin' from beneath the ground
And if we wanna' even out, it's time to plant some seeds of our own
Okay then now's the time we make a move
Instead of waitin' on um' just to tell us "what would Satan do?"
Tryin' to live right, but it's hard because we make it blue
My baggins' fam' is cookin' up some heat we bringin' straight to you

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Left the gym upon your iPods, two liters of that lita'
They love to hate on my squad, like we ain't earned it neitha'
We headline the grind for better times and better features
No room for ego, so please kill the mega divas
See us breakin' ground, ran up and got a betta' belay the sound
Tell em' again, ima' get a bacon now, sinkin' down, take the crown
Thank you kindly, rewind me, it ain't that hard to find me
The waters hot, we got the plot, it's time to deep fry me
Time we, step it up, get it up, get ahead and get a little sentimental up
Pack it up, rappers suck, and I don't wanna' ever let em' ever get enough
But I will make em' witness to the force thou'
Smokin' everything in sight, and tappin' out the morse code
