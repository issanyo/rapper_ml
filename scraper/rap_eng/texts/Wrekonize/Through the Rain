[Verse 1:]
She stands in a place that nobody can sympathise or travel to
Agonising avenue
Caught between a rock and hard place, what'd you rather do
Pain inside her body and her mind, just a dab'll do
Hard to overcome and just too much to try and saddle through
She can feel it in her bones, broke down, battered blue
I can hear it in her tone, she don't wanna rattle you
Peace is in her being, but the ram's a fire animal
Phenomenal woman, that is word to Maya Angelou
Breathless, why is it that I am being tested?
Like the world is checking if I'll just head for the exit
She whispered to herself and nervously chewed her necklace
Everything about this here is changing my perspective
Wrek this, situation here is kinda wrecked, it's
Got us out in limbo keeping Zelda in the nexus
Jess this, may be a cliche but it's a test, it's
Trying to see if it can break you down

[Hook:]
But if you handling the pain
Then you'll be damn sure to make it through the rain
What'd pop say?
If we keep pressing on
Got the bills stretching on
More stress and I'm a mess
But I keep pressing on, keep pressing on I guess
If they bleed flesh and I'm leaking all on the deck
But I keep a smile right up in they face
Cause if I'm handling the pain
Then I'll be damn sure to make it through the rain
Like mom said
If we keep pressing on
Got the bills stretching on
More stress and I'm a mess
But I keep pressing on, keep pressing on I guess
If they bleed flesh and I'm leaking all on the deck
But no rain ain't ever stopped us yet

[Verse 2:]
He stands in a place that nobody can understand or even go
Out amongst the seedy folk
Living under stars that you probably never seen before
Dirty shoes, dirty socks, soul keep it cleaner though
Trying to find a balance on a planet full of evil notes
Feeling quite lost, can you show him how or lead him home?
He ain't seen his momma in a minute and she need him close
Everything he does is in a toss up, he don't know
Which way is the right way and he's hoping it won't be below
Breathless, why is it I'm living in the vestige
Sleeping in the forest painting arrows on the exit
Brother's tryna call me up, sister's on the next click
Dad ain't talking to me and I feel so disconnected
Wrek this, situation here is kinda wrecked, it's
Not another episode you load up on your Netflix
Ozzy man get this, life is just a test, it's
Trying to see if it can break you down

[Hook:]
But if you handling the pain
Then you'll be damn sure to make it through the rain
What'd pop say?
If we keep pressing on
Got the bills stretching on
More stress and I'm a mess
But I keep pressing on, keep pressing on I guess
If they bleed flesh and I'm leaking all on the deck
But I keep a smile right up in they face
Cause if I'm handling the pain
Then I'll be damn sure to make it through the rain
Like mom said
If we keep pressing on
Got the bills stretching on
More stress and I'm a mess
But I keep pressing on, keep pressing on I guess
If they bleed flesh and I'm leaking all on the deck
But no rain ain't ever stopped us yet
