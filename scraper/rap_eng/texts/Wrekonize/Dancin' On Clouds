For that
[Verse: Wrekonize]
Attention fellow fiends for the green
I been smoked out in bars, old cars and limousines
Hittin' trees like a lumberjack, stack the heavy steam dream
A foot long L-ee's smelly like jelly beans
Lettin' seeds grow free when I plant the jam
Gettin' so high that I'm lookin' outside and see Amsterdam
I'm Reverend Ran if you B.E.T. seein' me with v.d
Is like seein' seeds up in my greenery
A casual smoker, only buyin' when I'm feelin' rugged
I cop an O for burn, I owe 'em like a couple hundred
I give Mary to plain Jane's when feelin' whack
Cop a sack, it's a fact, weed's my aphrodisiac
So sit back so we can chuckle hun
I'm big L, let's smoke a J, I'll give ya hard dick and bubble gum
I'm Cheech and Chong with the bong, I'm Wesley with the pipes
I'm munchie shoppin' with my cousin, guzzlin' extra sprite
Cotton mouth strikes like pops of thunder
Need a shoppin' cart in 7/11 to stop my hunger
Underneath all the stress of the weak
I sneak peaks at the green coral reef to get deep sea
I live sweet like Mike & Ike's, calm when I light the pipe
Sell me whack shit, you're gettin' striked tonight
Blunts Baggins bangin' dimes with a nickle
Fiddle on the roof, Malcolm in the middle
Mouth full of skittles, we settle down as we travel up
It's better now, with a batch of cut, Plex'll mix a salad up
The doobie brother gettin' hippie on a groovy track
Bloodshot lenses and stomach full of Scooby snacks
