[Intro]
Hey that hurts a little bit
You don't like it there do you
Oh I don't know, kinda fun sometimes

[Chorus: Bernz & Wrekonize]
When it all goes down and the moon comes up on you
Tell me who you'll be under it's glow
Change is what you've grown accustomed to
But you changed into someone that I don't know
Changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Somebody ID'd the body
She Whitney and I was Bobby
She was my favorite hobby
My little coffee Ferrari
I met her back at Miami and lost her before she found me
Acting like I was Clyde, pretending like she was Bonnie
Living under a spell, she was Aleister Crowley
I'm out here rocking these bells
She said he's selling the body
First it was wedding bells
And now it's just origami
And I was too high to tell
Who you was before the party but then

[Chorus: Bernz & Wrekonize]
When it all goes down and the moon comes up on you
Tell me who you'll be under it's glow
Change is what you've grown accustomed to
But you changed into someone that I don't know
Changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Since packing the minutes
I swore that we would have been this
Everything that I witnessed
Was perfect never a blemish
Every time we would visit
It felt like a day in Venice
But now when I catch you tripping
I'm living in outer limits
I'm trying to find a winner I knew to have all the spirit
Now you take too much spirits
And overdo your appearance
I just want to be me without feeling the interference
But every time I get with you
It's all the things I've been hearing so um
Tell me

[Chorus: Bernz & Wrekonize]
When it all goes down and the moon comes up on you
Tell me who you'll be under it's glow
Change is what you've grown accustomed to
But you changed into someone that I don't know
Changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
You changed into someone that I don't know
