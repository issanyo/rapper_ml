[Intro: Bernz]
Hey!
Alright
Come on

[Verse 1: Bernz]
All praise goes to this blank page
I'm psycho man, I'm going insane
Been a minute since I been in
Feeling nothing but rage
Spilling blood on the terracotta
When I crash on the trophy case
Thinking of my mortality whenever the track erase
Sparrow to fallacy and back again with a wack spin
Drinking away the pain my baby say I keep bottled in
Asking me if my vices got me running from something
Got me cocking my gun and back it
Got me checking my numbers
Gotta scream at the sky
Gotta light these hands on the fire
Couple say that I retired
But something tell me they lying
See can't extinguish the sinners without a sign of the times
I'm betting to roll away that I gamble away my life
When the moon is full we get down
Scared of summer we stand back
Stronger than Cuban licks
Around my left with a tight grasp
This is all that I been
No reason to fight back
Every day is a struggle
Getting high off the contact

[Hook: Wrekonize & Bernz]
I'm going awol, awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol, awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Man down, missing from expedition
Running for 34 years and time respects missing
But I keep nodding like my neck's twitching
Cause they got issues they misuse for the next edition
Reading between the lines can be good for health
Sometimes its way better if you just do for self
Cause all these selfish suckers think they way above us
Looking down on us they kill you motherfuckers
I'm vibing, I fathom had em some simply matter
Who talk me in circles like it's a game of ladders
What is this operation, who runs the data
It's coded to get me loaded and off my platter
Y'all thinking the same same, the blame game
And put us out on the chain game with lame brains
But I am not another pawn on your board
I will claw at the floor and escape these chains

[Hook: Wrekonize & Bernz]
I'm going awol, awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol, awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol

[Interlude: Wrekonize]
Awol, that's unexpected
Awol, that's unexpected
Awol

[Outro: Wrekonize & Bernz]
I'm going awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol on them
And I don't know when I'll be back again
And they ain't see me since
I never thought it would come down to this
I'm going awol
