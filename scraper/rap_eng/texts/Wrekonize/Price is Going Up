[Hook: Bernz & Wrekonize]
All day workin' for an overnight success
Short days' long nights living on the edge
This is some'n here that you wouldn't want to miss
Better fuck with me now 'cause after this
The price is going up
Yeah, the price is going up
The price is going up
Better fuck with me now 'cause after this
Yeah, the price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Underestimated, overlooked, and underappreciated
I was in the cut blazing, getting high off music I was making
Never cared much for trophy placement
Only if the soul been out the basement
Wastin' space, time, and all my patience
'Til I got a call to make my own creations
Had a larger conversation
Are you real or are you fakin'?
Do you really hear what we been making?
Or are you weirded out by greatness?
Countin' sheep's my occupation
Can you see my dissertation?
'Til I be your overnight sensation
Now wake your ass up and lets ride, ride, ride
Get inside, ho, I drive
Don't know where it's alright
Trust in us, you'll be fine
I can feel it's my time
Engine tuned and it's prime
Chasin' hits my whole life
I'm obsessin' and that's fine
When you sleep I'm alive
And this time will be the last time I give out free samples of the pie

[Hook: Bernz & Wrekonize]
All day workin' for an overnight success
Short days' long nights living on the edge
This is some'n here that you wouldn't want to miss
Better fuck with me now 'cause after this
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
And it goes up, up, up, up, up
Everybody wanna leave us in the cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
But we elite and we hit them in the gut, gut, gut, gut, gut
Fuckin' life until I finally get my nut, nut, nut, nut, nut
(Nut)in' breaks a man down like a little bit of broken pride
I got a house full of friends and smoke inside
We don't worry about the day or the week ya dig
When you vibe so high time supposed to fly
If you need me come try climbing the ceiling
I could shit on folks who miss the boat with the pretense
No joke, no cloaks, no defense
Makes me feel like I've been cuffed in the precinct
But I been steadily making climbs up high to the pedigree
Now these fools really wanna try getting me
Like I ain't been here kicking melodies
All up in the middle like a centerpiece
All my friends are loud getting heavily
You got screws like Ebenezer Japenese
And didn't even know until your whole damn show was in jeopardy

[Hook: Bernz & Wrekonize]
All day workin' for an overnight success
Short days' long nights living on the edge
This is some'n here that you wouldn't want to miss
Better fuck with me now 'cause after this
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 3: Tech n9ne]
Forever did a verse for 10k
But now that it's old as Bengay
15k is what you men pay
If you want the hip-hop from a chopper sensei
That stellar music realize you gotta rack your brain
Now what they want is twenty racks broke game
When I rap so strange, I'ma stack more change
And it really ain't even enough of that cocaine
Ever since "Questions" '98
My people want a verse, they want aggression
Chop it, sessions, and I made a lot of good impressions
Still, they want the N9ne in one seven
But I'm getting tired of the challenge that chase me
Escape me with the flow and they be tryna erase me
They crazy because I leave em achey breaky
When Nina be off safety, want it, you gotta pay me
'Cause it take all my time
This mathematics, create all my rhymes
Ask anybody that's technical with the flow spectacle
We kill the rest and they lines; vegetables
That's why they have seven songs in one day
Tech is a jet, I get to gassin' up on the runway
Some be saying the price scorching 'em like a sunray
But everyone pay 20k for the gunplay

Yeah, the price is going up
The price is going up
Better fuck with me now 'cause after this
Yeah, the price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
The price is going up, up, up, up, up
