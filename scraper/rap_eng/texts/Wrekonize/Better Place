It's alright, it's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright
It's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
Th-th-this feels like a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
It's been a minute since we last got up in this
So this feels kinda Strange, kinda bootlegged
But at the same time, since we've been a ghost
We've been toast, this thing is up and grew legs
I had plans of a land with my band, with a man, plenty grands but then you left
And at first I was bitter, I cannot tell a lie, I was hoping you would do less
But I shook the demons
I want more for my people, even took the grievin'
And made change that aimed to get hooked to ceilings
So one day we could all look back at the view
Not many crooks believin'
They can come get at Â¡MAYDAY!'s book, they schemin'
To divide us and grind us, they rooks and even
Thought we might stop the ride if we didn't have the crew
I woke up in a place that I never knew
More looks in the book, more revenue
All the fans comin' up saying where were you
I'm just hopin' that you're happy with the residue
Cause it feels like the scenery is getting better for us all and it needs to be
That's the go-gettin' gold like vis-a-vis, cause everybody gotta path and it seems to me

It's alright, it's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright
It's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
Th-th-this feels like a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright

[Verse 2: Bernz]
What's my destination? Found a station
Now I was well enough for observation
Outside in is how your boy is facing
Window-shopping at the new location
Took some time to get myself together
Now we tight, we Gucci patent leather
Fuck the hate, lately I'm like whatever
Where I'm at, the view is simply better
Plus a little bit of alcohol's got me going like a jabberjaw
Talk shit like an alpha dog, reminisce till it's last call
Hit a blunt till it's blast off
Can you show me to the stash pot, put the issues in the backdrop?
Go ahead take a snapshot and yeah
We've been picking at the padlocks while you were busy talking to me through a laptop
So let bygones be bygones
And I let bullshit just pile on
We both came up on that island
All the mercenaries are Simon
I've been out searching for higher ground
Some feel like it's coming now
So I can't believe that it's finally time to say
It's alright... It's okay (true story)
It's all good (that's what it is)... It's all love

[Hook: Bernz & Ryan "Myagi" Evans"]
It's alright, it's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think we're in a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright
It's alright
It's okay, it's okay
It's all good, it's all love
I think we're in a better place, yeah
Th-th-this feels like a better place, yeah
I think it's safe to say it's alright
