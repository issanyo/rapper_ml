[Intro]
When you just think...you can't take it anymore
Come drag your knuckles
Do some caveman shit, you know what I mean
You gotta be a buckle-sagging, hustle having brother
With your knuckles dragging

[Verse 1]
Waitin' tables and the wage is minimum
My family needs to eat and I must be the one defendin' em
Double shift, Friday fix, fuckin' spot is packed as balls
Someone must have called in sick, thanks a lot for jackin' off
I got 6 tables, 3 are cool no prob', one some older broads
One a JV squad, they just won a title, tryna celebrate the odds, and so I gave them all free drinks and onion straws
Then this last table of douchebag supremes, suit tie regime
Do nothing but juke, lie, and scheme
They tried to call me over with that snooty 'snap your fingers'
I just tried to play pretend as if I never heard the ringer
Better not be disrespect, I am not that fuckin' dude
Yeah, I need my job and all, but I will not be stuck and screwed
If they cross the line then you gon' see just what I mean
I'll be hopping all up on their table just to fuckin' scream

[Hook]
You think you're civilized
You think your money means shit to me
Well I got news for ya sucker
I just don't see how you get down, down
You think you're civilized
You think your money means shit to me
Well I got news for ya sucker
I'm a buckle-sagging, hustle-having brother with my knuckles dragging
Knuckle dragging
Knuckle dragging
Knuckle dragging

[Verse 2]
See I just left the job, clocked out (NOPE), I just fuckin' quit
They can mail my last check out, and they can suck a dick
Job was paying peanuts, and I am a gorilla
Knuckles dragging on the floor, I'm bearded like a killer
I'm pounding on the concrete like nobody can harm man
King of the concrete jungle, fuck a Tarzan
Swinging from the ropes, and dropping down on everyone below
Ladies looking at me like a monster with a rubber soul
Now I'm feeling free, apron in the trash can
I'll get my respect by any method that a man can
No more talking down to me, so keep it canned-canned
Everybody give me space, this here is my jam-jam
So next time you see somebody and their hustles lagging
Or they're getting abused by some uppity yuppy maggot
Grab 'em by the throat and clutch 'em like a fuckin' savage
Cause some problems can only be solved when you're knuckle dragging

[Hook]
You think you're civilized
You think your money means shit to me
Well I got news for ya sucker
I just don't see how you get down, down
You think you're civilized
You think your money means shit to me
Well I got news for ya sucker
I'm a buckle-sagging, hustle-having brother with my knuckles dragging
