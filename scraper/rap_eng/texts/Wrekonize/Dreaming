[Hook]
Dreaming, but I don't think that I'mma sleep tonight
I'm living the dream and
This just can't be life

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
See, I've been waking on the cold nights
Half a pack left, poor life, try to grab us while we roll dice
Scatter, back to the block in an hour
Just 'bout time to change clothes and a shower
Set up shop by the dope head
Her-oin stashed in the Pro-Ked, gun by the moped
Fingerprints in the last weapon I threw away
So while you away, 9 to 5 to a day
I will us-ua-lay, lay by the basement store
Sling raw by the barber shop
Jerry's getting cut, stash my work there
As long as gave Jerry a cut, I could work there

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Okay, feel asleep and half awake
Trying to direct but now I feel I'm at the matinee
Look mom, I'm on the screen, don't mean to beat the pack away
So I can share the meaning of get up and get the lap relayed
Relayed, relayed, get me to give me the cash I made
Dippin' you into a relaxin' place, let me just get out my pack and pray
To the gods of my private little dream scape
I see you sleeping on so long even the sheep skate
Each break, each melody causes
All the jealous folks to relish those who readily rock shit
Knock, knock, get ready to drop kick
The hands of time then rewind it right when the clock ticks

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I cry, nobody listenin'
Cause a baller let a baller ball and his bottom he brought him
But a brawler was smaller, bombing better up his body blitzin
I'll abolish him, it's bothering it's about Benjamin's product
Get bottom pimpin' just borrowing just ballin' 'bition
I annihilated Molly, no longer dilated
I fly away, it seems high away this is how I made it
I get violent, when mine is spend on the IRS
To silence somethin' crying, I get too sick to try and make it
Man I'm dreamin', I can't believe it
Makin' it hella-hella but everybody need it
I feed it, to so many sources 'til I'm depleted
Feelin' I'm really beat up with greed, I can't conceive it

[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Can't be
Pursuit of happiness had me writing in classrooms
Falling asleep, only to block assholes
Grew up a crash test dummy, no fastener
Father was gone so long, she called me bastard!
Faster, pussycat! Ain't no slowing down!
Dreamt myself in a corner in order to make it out
Shout iMAYDAY! now! Get faded now!
Ink on my fingers, dead ringer for the singer but I'm Bernz
While they sleep straight 'till they urns
Brown liquor in my stomach making my chest burn
They heard, I count sheep for four mo'
Fucka, got a message from Noreaga
Said "Wake 'em up, brother" {​*Alarm Clock*}​
