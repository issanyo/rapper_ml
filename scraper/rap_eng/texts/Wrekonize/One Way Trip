[Verse 1: Bernz]
Yeah, dancin' just like it's the wedding day
Cause we in a better place
The train is ahead of pace
Takin' us both into outer space
And now that we're both awake, we're flowin' to Rosa Lake
It's pullin' us home just like the undertow quietly tuggin' at my legs
I'm finally in fall and everything suddenly change into a different place
I don't even bother with the thought that I've been lost inside a jungle up-to-date
I'm on the dark-dealing expression
And what I am feelin' is descend
(?)
Everybody got a common bud and got a lot of time to put you on it
And I'm just bein' honest, I'm just bein' real
Losin' that first deal was my college
Been mis-education on myself
Cause for every wrong turn was a toll
And every song I mine in gold
And every rhyme I don't spit in code
No lookin' for certain redemption
Was conscious of every deception
The pain is a gain of reflection
They blind to a fadin' perception
Tryin' absolutely everything I can
To not even try and look back
I'm hopin' this thing stay on track
Cause I don't think I'll ever be back
I won't be back

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
I just found out, there's no way out
I can't look back, it's a one way trip
I'm in here now, there's no way out
We can't turn back, it's a one way trip

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Uh-huh
Good mornin' friends, you are to lend an ear
I'm feelin' like waxin'
The poetic get it while it's copacetic
I'm addicted to passion
I'm addicted to action
I'm addicted to grind
See, I can't turn back to the past then
Why would I want to rewind?
I'm fine most days, these micro-pains, I'm feelin' a hypochronda
I feel that it's just I can't wait to relate to the nights that beyond us
The nights we can wonder, and get lost with the monsters
While they just keep tryna pin us to genres
I'd sleep if I could, I probably should
But my mind's lyin' by Daisy
I'm on my hood, and thinkin' what's good
I'm watchin' the planes fly my way
Thinkin' if I bite, and bring you to my life
I might not be worthy
Or maybe I wouldn't deserve me
It's tricky to know what the curve be
From this concrete, at the swap meet
Where I'm steady tryin' spot them black leaks
It's a petty circus I do not keep
Those around me who say that they not freaks
Maybe we'll meet in the day shift
Or out with the black and the grey splits
However we ride to the great, Miss
It's surely to be a one way trip, sayin'

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
I just found out, there's no way out
I can't look back, it's a one way trip
I'm in here now, there's no way out
We can't turn back, it's a one way trip
