[Intro: Wrekonize & Savannah Cristina]
You make me want to

[Verse 1: JL]
Get down, break it down, break my rules
Right down, want it now, make my moves
Good vibe and I like that (like that)
I’m surprised that I’m right back (right back)
Caught up in this moment
In a G low key so cold with it
It is so lit
Make a nigga want to own it
And we can both spit
Go get into some mo’ shit
What you really want?
Where you really come from?
Not just anyone
You can get it done huh?
You be killing ‘em, give me give me something
God I’m getting sprung when I’m in the function
You got me loose
You got truth
Put that to use
Who got the juice?
Let me find out you’ve got wings
Make man want to pick out rings
You got themes
Un'ttached without strings
Choosed up if we pick out teams
Hypnotizing
Fantasizing
Unsurprising
My nature rising
Now you go un-catched
You go unmatched
Can’t imagine that you won a once match
You’re not the average
You’ve got the magic
I’ve got to have it
Aaaaaah

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Savannah Cristina]
You make me want to
Have someone
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to
Have me some
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Call in sick and not do a thing today
Change plans, pretend it’s a holiday
Do dumb shit and act irresponsibly
Wake up late and roll up another J
Cancel meetings and ditch all my dates
Ignore all calls and forward all names
Do what you want, feed all your tastes
That’s how I feel when I feel your waist
Bet you were a raver girl
Ever since you’ve been in every verse
Should’ve known it was a red alert
‘Cause now I’m letting you affect my work
To say I’ll probably end up getting hurt
But I love the perks
And how the lines are blurred
When it comes to this I’m like a connoisseur
So I’m taking my time now for what it’s worth
And do what I prefer
Whatever might occur
So
I’m ahead of your direction
Get a little in tune with your essence
Let you do what you do and not stress it
Go and get in the groove that’s infectious
This another now go and get a summer run
Give it to you in your city when I want to come
Baby you know that it’s litty hoe we’re never done
You know what you do?

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Savannah Cristina]
You make me want to
Have someone
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to
Have me some
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Break the rules
And change the mood
I’ve been all around the planet but I stay with you
You’ve got the flavour of Rome, you move like Venice
Solid ground never did suit you did it?
I feel it in the pit of my soul
But I hide it and play like I never did know
You’re a modern day Helen
I better tell ‘em
I got me a woman that’d make ‘em all jealous
That look in your eye
Has got the other ones looking through a crooked design
You whispered your name and I took it to mind
‘Cause who would want to forget such a woman so fine
I had plans this evening
But I cancelled ‘em all for a candid reason
Trying to learn your body, mind and your seasoning
Trying to find a way to get a gram of Eden
You make me wanna
Run, hop, skip, jump, make you my baby momma
Have a couple kids and get crazy I’mma
Talk out a line when I blame it on the
Alcohol
See I gave you a line but I doubt you’ll call
If I wasted your time that’s my bad and all
I just had to come and let you know

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Savannah Cristina]
You make me want to
Have someone
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to
Have me some
If you’re looking for me
You can find me
I’ll be right here at the function trying to
Grab someone
Vibe is so hypnotic
That I want to push up on it
Yeah you make me want to
