[Verse 1 Bernz]
Check it, word
Let me write this down before I forget
Things have changed for me since you left
I was just a boy, I confess
Tryna act grown and pump my chest
Tryna act the part with no screen test
Never really knowin' what I believed in
Livin' too close to all my demons
Livin' every day like it's weekend
Yeah, but then you left
It was like a death
The aftershock was felt so direct
We pried a lock to our treasure chest
We sold our memories and went out west
I used to blame the system for all this mess
But now I ain't got time to really know what's left
I used to sit at your desk, tryna play pretend
But since you've been gone, I ain't been there since
I went and chalked it all up to destiny
Say "it's God gettin' the best of me"
Givin' me gifts I ain't know I need
And givin' you strength to face your worst dreams
But finally you're free, we'll wonder what we've seen
We'll wonder who we are after where we've been
This for my mom and my next-of-kin
Waitin' here, until the end

[Chorus: Danny Acosta, Bernz, & Wrekonize]
Even when things are gettin' rough
Are we just tryna find a way to run?
Even when we've both just had enough
We've both been addicted to the rush
And still, it's just the same old us
And still, it's just the same old us
And still, the same, the same old us

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I wake up from a nightmare, look around the room
Turnin' on the light there, to double check that it hadn't come true
The world was a cold one
Nothing much I could do
But call on my one and my only, you know that I only need you
When the world turns up any hatred
And these other ones act all basic
I'll become the man with no name and my faces
I'm just lookin' out to you to come save us
So I'll just dodge all the fake ass extra-types
Through the madness, passage it's extra tight
Full of savage sadness that it gets me like
"Man, is anybody out here set for life?"
I tried runnin' 'round the planet all alone
Didn't feel right on my own
And even when the devil come to meddle in our home
We know that tomorrow can be gold
When I'm on the road and I get you on the phone
I ain't tryna let you just go
You've been with me since nobody even listen to the flow
And I'mma hold you down until we're both gone

[Chorus: Danny Acosta, Bernz, & Wrekonize]
Even when things are gettin' rough
Are we just tryna find a way to run?
Even when we've both just had enough
We've both been addicted to the rush
And still, it's just the same old us
And still, it's just the same old us
And still, the same, the same old us

[Outro: Danny Acosta]
Old us, old us, old us
You told them way too much to say you're sayin' up
And try to change at us, it's just the same old us
You told them way too much
Oh yeah, you told them way too much to try to change it up
Just the same old us, old us, old us
