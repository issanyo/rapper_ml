I guess things could be worse

[Verse 1 - Wrekonize]
Hello brother; s-s-salutations from a Lego lover
Building bricks to cross a bridge outta this ghetto's gutter
Keeping in touch, but mostly this life, that could be hard to do
We living in separate worlds, which truly tears my heart in two
I hear the talking, and you're walking, wishing for the coffin
But keeping your noggin off the bottom is so truly awesome
Ya see, they weaseled us with promises of false degrees
And then they seeded us as hostages to awful fees
On our fucking knees. What a fucking tease
Keeping us lost while breading the cost
They drain us, they fuck us and leave
Now we've been stuck in the trees, and the alcohol
Which I can't fucking believe, cause lately I'm out of all my whiskey;
Its been risky since the days we jumped the school fence
And ran into that addict, frantic, looking for those blueprints
I started bagging groceries, well, only for two cents
But kept it positive, and I've been singing happy tunes since

This here's my letter to the lost
My get up, get up, gone, things get better, things go wrong
Keep your head up and you better get a job tomorrow
I've been betting on a way to keep it golden for him
When the world is coming down on your open door
What the fuck you gonna do when its supposed to fall?

[Hook - Wrekonize]
Let it fall, (okay)
Let it fall back into place
Let it fall, down, (see, this is just like building blocks, y'know what I'm saying?)
Into place
Let it fall, let it fall
Let it fall back into place
Let it fall, down, (down, down, down)
Into place

[Verse 2 - Bernz]
Everything ain't what it seems; things can change in just a blink
Every time I wake up, pinch myself before I hit the gym
Life's a bitch, that's the biz, still I'm tryna teach her tricks
Miami makes it hard cause pretty people act the ugliest
Ain't nobody tell me shit though, unless they walk in my kicks
Yell Â¡MAYDAY! everyday, like kamikaze p-pilots
Everybody always got opinions on how you should live
Some people never rock they standards cause half are from music shit
The bigger the city, the lonelier the prison
So when they turn off the lights you glow, self defense mechanism
Dirty pigeons fib and fidget suppressing feelings
Never realizing dirty wings can fly, there's no ceiling
Nobody got answers; they just tryna fake that shit
If you're feeling stuck right now, then make some quick adjustments
Been in the darkest places only now to see the light
So when they asking why we toast, we say its only right
