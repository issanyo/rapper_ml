[Hook]
Walkin' round this planet Earth, tryin' to find a place to live
Strollin' down this crazy town, without a goddamn thing to give
And it makes me say A, don't it make you say A?
Do-do-do-do

[Verse 1]
Act one acquire activation, adrenaline administered through avid animation
Add a man to your backbone, boy out from the apex
Some fed up off this game of strange and I ain't even ache yet
I'm in it for the accolade, I'm in it for the awe
I'm in it to apply an applause in Arkansas
I started back when tryin' to apprehend a genre
And ended up adjacent to an angry anaconda
I'm an alcohol star ridin' high in his days
Still got enough aim to gain a claim like an a-viation ace
And ran around with the plague
And gave it aids I'm on a plane to outer space
Twenty-six is quite a vicious stage
I'm holding back runnin' gunnin' for a triple play
I can only think a few reasons why to live today
So let the kicks ride as I apply exhibit A

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Two-thousand (Ten) A.D, in a city where it's hard to live without the A.C
I troop tropics with my own A-team trying to A-chieve and ancient A-G's
We advertise acoustic averitions, analyze a way to ambition, man listen
I been tryin' to adapt and make my soul anabolic
Without the A an A makin' me an alcoholic
Holler if you ever had a little dream of your own
And had A-holes tryin' to make you A-clone
Tried A-ttack an act (?) and saw that they owned
The blocks with A-Phones as well
Eighty six is quite a ways away
I watch P's and Q's hopin' they don't fade away
I pray I live long enough to hear you say olay!
And one way or another hope we end up A-okay
