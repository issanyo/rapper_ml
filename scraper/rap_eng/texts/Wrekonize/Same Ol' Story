[Verse 1]
My mother birth me two years before creatin' a daughter
When things were cool until relations went ill with my father
Pack his bags left Florida became a New Yorker
You wanna hear it got harder, but why should I bother?
Should I tell you that my brother had an eating disorder
Or that my mother had to work three jobs to support us
Maybe it's you wanna hear I was fatherless orphan
And I've seen most of family already locked in that coffin
It's nonsense, negativity can tire me out
And I got problems I don't really feel like rhymin' about
My wife to be practically, at every guy in a mouth
Could have brought you damn disease, which I wouldn't doubt
So I drank any alcohol that I could find in my house
Until I couldn't whine about it, slide it off with the couch
And decided, I'mma make a right in my route
And try to find harmony within its mind that I joust
It's about the music - the celebration of life
Not these fiction fairy tales desecratin' the mic
50 carries nine bullets that he stuck to his pride
And it doesn't seem to remember it's really lucky survive

[Hook] (2X)
It's the same old story again
The one who constantly doesn't
Speak of the struggle, just doesn't fit in
If they don't hear about you losin'
They don't care if you win
We all got our own problems
I don't need to pretend

[Verse 2]
Begin, on a Saturday night, at the local hip hop shop I'm grabbin' a mic
Critics circle around the stage like a group of parasites
Transmittin' messages between each other like satellites:
"Battle strikes of family life live and he's white
Kinda sounds to me like the Marshall Mathers type!"
You better re-access that misunderstanding
Might get uncomfortable when you disappear from your family's sight
I'm just jokin' now, calm down gentlemen, frankly I'm not Em
And I'm not tryin' to better him, truthfully, I really can't see resemblance
Besides the fact that both of our skin tones lack melanin
Our stories different from each other, start with residence
And that's only one fragment from the block of evidence
I wrote my first rhyme before Dre signed Eminem
So how the fuck can I be standin' in the second wind?

[Hook] (2X)
It's the same old story again
White kid picks up the mic today
And now he gets compared to Em
And I'm just wonderin'
Where all this strange rumors begin
Cause I really don't see the point
It's just the tone of my skin

[Verse 3]
So when, will this bullshit stop, when I've completely lost my mind
And a full clips drop the school kid thought, I'd never make a true hit pop
So I dedicated my life and did what few could not
Became a DJ to make money and move my block
And learned how to rock a mic just to peruse my thoughts
I used the arts, do live shows in the parks
Do anything but sell my ass to move high in those charts
And finally sparked the fire of the vinyl that starts
The rebirth the hip hop that's kept high in your hearts
I'm an underground fan I'm sugar line in my thoughts
So you motherfuckers can hear it while you blinded by stocks
And to all friends who hate me cause they thought I forgot
Eat a dick, I didn't hate you when you went to your job
Rhyming's cut throat, you just swear it ain't hard
You think it's all stars bitches and ridiculous cars
But you weren't at the studio when I was droppin' those bars
You were at keg parties, being sick on somebody's floor
If that's your only excuse, you needin' some more
Cause procrastination's the main reason you ain't raw
The streets ain't war - that's just your vision of life
Any soldier can vouch for the battle dent in your site
I made this a closing call but I figure tonight
It's really not because I'm only now beginnin' to fight

[Hook]
That same bullshit story again
Kid fights to find his dreams
And in turn he loses all of his friends
The same kid who thought that
He could made reality bend
Now realizes that the spoon
Is just the part of the trend
The same sorry-ass story again
Turnin' every girl away
And fear of what was broken I can't mend

[Outro]
I'm tryin' to find myself in these lines that I send
I'm tryin' to see peace now, so my story can end
I'm tryin' to find myself in these lines that I send
I'm tryin' to see peace now, so my story can end
I'm tryin' to find myself in these lines that I send
I'm tryin' to see peace now
