[Verse 1]

I build bars and I break bread
Drink good whiskey on a great spread
Got stellar love i get space head
Better back up off me withcha late cred
Cuz the partys gone and i party on
Wrek's world feel the ambience
I break my back as if i’m hardly on
Trying to snag another cold hard charting song
This world is deep down beneath your feet now
Release the peace on your own
Get another piece to eat now while I give beat downs
To who all seek to oppose
Snake and bat to say make ya clap and break basic tracks on streets and below
Crazy good with my crazy hoods so don’t break the lease cuz i’m coming home so
Push 'em to the highs better side of the meter
Walking round the planet trying to Step in the arena
Filling up my tank in the hollywood amoeba
Loving every one of ya’ll for being the believers
Everybody running round the corner trying to find another gimme got it good and nobody even knows
That the worlds is going apeshit and enemies are faceless bullying the little man he just wanna grow
Give me some greenery brighten up all this scenery
Broken promises leisurely clouding up all my thievery
Gimme that gimme that sit it back sit it back and the top row don’t wanna know
That the middle got sizzled low key playing fiddle in the little bit of riddles in the row bro
If you need to get around all the blocks
Then you should probably stop
All of that crazy talk and get them bodies rocked
We been the confidants holding a prompt response
In the middle of my commandants really ready when the bombing starts

[Hook]
Have you ever just flown away
Took yourself a furlow
Got yourself a good place to stay
Sipping on some merlot
Waiting on the big world to end one day it could all go go
I’ll be here and still smiling smiling
That what this is all for for


[Verse 2]
I build bars and I break bread
Drink good whiskey on a great spread
Got stellar love i get space head
Better back up off me withcha late cred
Cuz the partys gone and i party on
Wrek's world feel the ambience
I break my back as if i’m hardly on
Trying to be the next god in the parthenon

And it don’t stop

What you need a bigger boat for
You ain’t brought back shit
You ain’t even got heart for
Even my low grade shit
What you need a bigger boat for
You ain’t brought back shit
Every time i make a run i run a muck
And never gave a flying fuck
They can all suck my dick

This is that reason men cut em fast and then bleed 'em
Human nature is evil and kill ourselves for no reasoning
Over popping the rock and we don’t wanna stop
Why the fuck we got space here galore
I been popping to lock up the people below me and hatefully boxing the poor or
If you need to get around all the blocks
Then you should probably stop
All of that crazy talk and get them bodies rocked
We been the confidants holding a prompt response
In the middle of my commandants really ready when the bombing starts

[Hook]
Have you ever just flown away
Took yourself a furlow
Got yourself a good place to stay
Sipping on some merlot
Waiting on the big world to end one day it could all go go
I’ll be here and still smiling smiling
That what this is all for for
