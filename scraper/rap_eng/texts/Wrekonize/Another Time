[Pre-hook: Bernz]
I don’t want nothin’ from none of y’all
All handouts, no let ups
I don’t need nothin’ from none of y’all
Matter fact, y’all got me fed up

[Hook: Bernz]
See I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Live from Staten Island, black battin’ a thousand
On cash in a flash, call me Barry Allen
Slick fashion is sick, you know daddy’s stylin’
Niggas take cheap shots like it was happy hour
The talkin’ is dead, it’s all for the bread
Even if the nigga cool still it’s off with the head
Never back down warrior bred
Rappers claimin’ they hot, I leave ‘em cold in the coroner’s bed
It’s the fifth brother, sick brother, pimp spitter with the grip rubber
Niggas hatin’ you bitch lovers
INS, Your Highness, scientist mind design the fly shit
Speakin’ of which, rewind this
Verbal intercourse, get off, go get your boss
Skywalker, how I hit ‘em with force, still
Killa Killa Hill and I’ll die reppin’
Will Smith with the flow, I am Legend

[Hook: Bernz]
See I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time

[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
Me and the squad used to fuck up troops
While you clowns played duck, duck, goose
We don’t shoot in the air, we sit ‘em down like musical chairs
The shooters is here, fashion statement, Ruger the gear
I Buddha with peers, my classmates let the macs quake
Until you holey like a goalie hockey mask face
Flame torsos, we spray four O’s
You rather get attacked by cane corso
I never let up (never) uniformed in the same getup
You fallin’ for the same setup
Gettin’ lured into my crazy hood
They say it’s good and rob ya, you get your whole frame wet up
For tryna cop a little smoke and get smoked
No empathy for the rich folks, they pitch coke
To suburbanites all about the murder life
It’s murder city, you heard it right, Detroit right

[Hook: Bernz]
See I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time

[Verse 3: Lil’ Fame of M.O.P.]
I got stripes like a Foot Locker uniform
You half donkey, half bird, like a unicorn
You a Pegasus, similar terms my dude
That means you hella bitch – Fizzy Wo’ said this
All that gang shit you poppin’ is irrelevant
I got some shit that’ll knock down the elephants
Sole survivor of the crack house tenement
Hood resident, stuck in my element

[Verse 4: Billy Danze of M.O.P.]
The realest chapter that was ever wrote
Worldwide head nod offer pure dope
Sycronized, oozin’ eyes off of slick quotes
They religiously follow me like the Pope
So I ain’t sweatin’ the flossin’, rap off-springs
Could never be Billy Danze, do that underball sting
I’m the hardest nigga to spit it, I get it how I get it
And get it how I live it, it’s vivid, you can’t fuck with it

[Pre-hook: Bernz]
I don’t want nothin’ from none of y’all
All handouts, no let ups
I don’t need nothin’ from none of y’all
Matter fact, y’all got me fed up

[Hook: Bernz]
See I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time
I’m from another time
