[Hook]
You can't hide from the sun shine, shine
You can't hide from the sun shine, shine
You can't hide from the sun shine, shine
You can't hide from the sun shine, do-do do-do do-do

[Verse 1]
I am man trapped here on this evil earth
Paratrooper packing parasites that heed your birth
Unnaturally natural at capturing animals and storing way more than a seasons worth
Stock up flesh to fester on uneven stoves
Adapt to the landscape, run, read, and row
Crush, kill, destroy, enemies bleed below
Spinning on a lost axis that don't seem well controlled
Blow for blow, we in the world of lost souls
Where the compass is a crook that craves to curve the crossroads
So by the time we speak, our levels meet a notch low
And they con us into cramped cubicles and condos
Crafty little devil, I've got medals on hold
Trying to redeem the dream that my ancestors stole
You told me reach for the sky, don't stress goals
So I set up solid ground where the water gets cold

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I am man trapped here in this evil place
Stabbing violent while they smile up and seize his face
Unnaturally natural at acting like animals and taking way more than a seasons wait
Stock up skin to thin on an uneven stove
Eyes red and bloodshot, can't be my soul
Pray up above, but they take me below
Losing everyone I love, somebody grant me control
Blow for blow, we in the world of lost souls
Where the web is world wide, but the spiders are culled
So by the time we realize the exit doors closed
They con us into working for clothes and bank rolls
Crafty little devils, I've got medals on hold
Trying to redeem the dream that my ancestors stole
Let's hope the road from Rome still leads home
You see I live on solid ground where the water gets cold

We press against an iron fence and I'm convinced that time is just a toll
The mind is rinsed with lies and tints to blind the sense, they speak expired soul

[Hook]
