[Intro]
Just like that, we're moving again
We set out to travel upon the backs of broken angels
Adopted dreams and thrift store halos
In a desolate world where your only as good as your sponsor
They tell us self-preservation is key
Move along the wasteland hoping
More souls are on the same mission as we
This is no longer a day dream, but a day nightmare
And as we walk along this desolate wasteland
We can only hope for one thing
To forget times passed

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Campfire stories with my fam getting drunk
Fire water open flames its getting debunked
Feeling like nothings the same game I'm full throttle
Drowning like the worm somebody trapped inside this bottle
Thinking about the better Etta James and such things
Give me a little taste of the past to shoot inside my veins
Whats changed? My friends growing fangs
And daytimes shorter because the suns out of range

And I know that nothing ever stays the same
No one ever really stays, it's not my fault
I blame myself and smoke this haze
I'll do it 'til the end of my days
Everything's lost
I look to the stars but they gone
I look for a sign in the dark at all costs
Look to the stars and the marks
We look for the chance to restart
Everything's lost

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Treated this planet like my scrap book
Add a picture add a clipping scratch the last look
Its not approved delete the image from my mac books
My memory equals about a gram now that's crook
I'm so confused, it's a bitter road we travel so I'm letting go
The gathering nattling got a micro chip implanted in my abdomen
And it's about 28 long years that Ive been dealing
But these days my memories dont really seem appealing
And so I find a distant memory beneath the world below
I've realized my destiny's not on the road I know
I'm feeling like a centipede, I'm reaching out for soul
And trying to remember that at sometime that I was whole
I found a distant memory, I found, I found
But desperatly I'm trying to press it down, down
Nostalgia is all around us watch me drown, drown
I wish I could forget what I know now, now
