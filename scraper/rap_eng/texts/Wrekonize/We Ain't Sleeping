[Verse 1: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You're all dressed up with nothing to do
But not tonight, these downtown clubs keep closing on you
We going till they shutting down
Down these streets, got nothing to lose
It's on tonight, out here on one, I'm in the mood
And I've been through this before
They said last call, I say one more
But every time I go, it's just the same old road
And every place that I've been seen
You make that the place to be
So can you stay with me until this drink is gone or one more song?

[Hook: Danny Acosta]
We ain't sleeping till it's over
So please don't leave me till its over
And we ain't sleeping till it's over
So please don't leave me till I'm sober
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping till it's over, over

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I've been out on a run
Trying to find me a sip of the demons rum
I know it may be late for some
But I'm here for it all and the evening's young
I may go in, I may go hard
I might end up in a place where I don't belong
Tore it down in my damn front yard
But if I don't have you by my side
I may not make it back though
I need you out where I go
Then we can find a way to get home
If you down to ride like a Drake track
Then I'm down to fly for some lay yak
Getting back home like ASAP
And I'm down to give you this payback

[Verse 3: Bernz]
Somebody done spiked the punch
But nobody here gives a fuck
Better get that refill in your cup
Better get it cause it's almost done
Better hope it lasts us all night
Better last till the sun comes up
Better hope these neighbors don't call the cops yet
Baby cause I'm almost drunk
You, you run circles around the competition
Round and round you go, you something vicious
On the town tonight with all the drinkers
Too much fun to stop and take a picture
We not bouncing till this shit is done
They kick us out and turn the lights on
If they do we might just up and run
Until they lest forget it and turn it up
Cause

[Hook: Danny Acosta]
We ain't sleeping till it's over
So please don't leave me till its over
And we ain't sleeping till it's over
So please don't leave me till I'm sober
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping
We ain't sleeping till it's over, over
