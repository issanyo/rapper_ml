[Intro:]
It's the final round
(There's only 2 days left) (x3)
Broke, broke, broke
Come on!

[Verse 1:]
Broke this down with amazing razor choppers known to chew the fat
Cadence's so dope they interrupt your flow, how rude is that?
Give me my respect and give it here if I may interject
I guess it's hard to Wrekonize without the intellect
305, swimming with the shark fin
Breaking down doors, stuffing whores till the margin
As innovative as Kendall Jenner, I beg your pardon?
But your festival was Fyre, who planned it? Billy McFarland?
Ha, y'all ain't really tryna get it where the wild things are
I've been grinding hard since back before my spine evolved
I'm Jon Taffer, to off rappers, I style their bars
What were they thinking tryna charge for such a minor cause
World's gone handheld in a hand basket
Halfway to so damn ratchet
They give us no chill, just Mad Max'in
It's like this whole place is so fucking savage
Retirees would fire 3 to get a buck on average

[Hook:]
So welcome to the carnival
Where everybody is just starving to hop on your balls
This PC generation is so freaking hard to call
I can't tell if I'm allowed to say anything at all
So please forward to my publicist if I say something to offend any one of you fucking pricks
Or if my leaf-burning brothers take a couple rips
To shed some light on how real a person's hustle gets

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I'm tripping, stress got me saying silly shit
My album drops on Friday, must be depressive getting it
The numbers, the soundscans, the bar, I'm tryna triple it
But truthfully, all of that shit should be so insignificant
I'ma bash it down like Cassius now, what a fascist clown is acting now
Lines are triple packing wow, don't hit that shit you'll have to drown
It's release week, further now they retreat
Asking me for retweets, so I threw 'em back like Beat Street
We independent, Snake and Bat, yes I represent it
But jump around on stage too much to really rock my pendent
And if I gave you my word, there's no question that I meant it
Into The Further, I'm tryna murder my past percentage
That's how I'm styled, how I keep my thoughts so Future Vintage
I'm motor-mouth murder menace, come get your groove diminished
Where were you going? I'm showing, never said I was finished
I'm Morse Code from my soul down to my outer limits
There's no games in my name, there's never been a gimmick
No C, no G, just me and nothing but these leaking lyrics
On a ship that's sinking further by the freaking minute
Does anybody got a sailboat, I'm deep up in it
Signing off for the season
It's been a blast but I got shows to rock with my legion
So I think it's about that time to

[Hook:]
Welcome you back to my carnival
Where everybody is just starving to hop on your balls
This PC generation is so freaking hard to call
I can't tell if I'm allowed to say anything at all
So please forward to my publicist if I say something to offend any one of you fucking pricks
Or if my leaf-burning brothers take a couple rips
To shed some light on how real a person's hustle gets

[Outro:]
And with this, we conclude
Into The Further freestyle session
I'd like to thank my brother Chip from the guild for these beautiful mixes
Strange Music, Â¡MAYDAY!

Into The Further
There's only 2 days left!
