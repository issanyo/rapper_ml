[Intro]
Yeah i understand
I get it i get it
Well this something i been telling you for a long time
You just don't want to ever hear me
I ain't gonna go through this again
Like i don't really understand
Why we have to keep doing this
It's like a big circle
I don't understand look
Oh for real?



[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Okay the phone just hung up, sorry 'bout the disconnect
But if I heard you any longer there'd be too much disrespect
So instead of phone tagging
I'm thinking 'bout just walking out don't mind my coat grabbing
Or the door slamming
This whole sitcom, has run a bit long
And the jokes ain't funny anymore so I'll just get gone
Let me get going
Everyday we arguing
Money 'bout the only reason
Silly how the paper can arrange us in a place for beefing
King and Queen's high treason
No more staring up at the ceiling
'Til it feels like my eyes are bleeding
What an ice cold season
Thank god we never saw a sunrise
By now that little star he would be teething
And my universe is breaching
So I'll just keep it moving even though you're asking me to jump back into feelings
You're like a yo-yo
Bouncing off a mountain top
In and out of flux and so abrupt
I really doubt you'll stop

[Hook: Wrekonize]
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See all this spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See you've been spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
Vertigo

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Okay the phone just rang, super nice to hear from you
Been about a week but kind of felt just like a year or 2
I've thought about us
I thought that it was over
But I hear your tone of voice and I can see you don't want closure
You wanna to stay a while and talk about us reconnecting
Talk about electives
For how to now protect us
Talking 'bout a son?
Shit I can't believe my ears just a week ago you said you ain't want one
You're kind of like a gymnast
Flipping on your wish list
You don't know what you want or when you want it damn well get this
I try to keep balance
From your razor sharp talons
But I'm Stuck out On An Island like that throwback Â¡Mayday! album
Lip-locking
All this flip-flopping
Got my hip-popping
Trying to stay centered but you got me on a trip clocking
Every single second it's one thing and then it's not
In and out of flux and so abrupt
I really doubt you'll stop

[Hook:Wrekonize]
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See all this spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See you've been spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
Vertigo


[Bridge: Wrekonize]
Okay the phone is off the hook
I'mma give you time
To think about your life
And just make up your mind
The phone's off the hook
I'mma give you time
To think about your life
And just make up your mind
Okay the phone is off the hook
I'mma give you time
To think about your life
And just make up your mind
The phone's off the hook
I'mma give you time
To make up your goddamn mind

[Hook:Wrekonize]
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See all this spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
All this jumping the line
And acting like it's fine
But it's your turn to go
See you've been spinning my mind
And thinning my time
Lord it gives me vertigo
Vertigo
