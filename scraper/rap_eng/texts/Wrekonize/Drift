[Verse 1: Bernz]
After all the lights are off, I'm usually ghost
But not before I put it up and spit another toast
Yeah I see shit I can't erase embedded in my soul
So this for all those motherfuckers that've done me wrong, moving on
I been all lost in the orbit, searching for slogans embedded inside da' organs
Fighting depression, hard
And it's a odd circumstance for a master of illusiaaan
Thats usually hiding behind the whiskey jars
But it's finally bout' to bloom
I ain't pulling out too soon
Rather hit the earth and bounce my ass right back up to the moon
By all of your accounts, I should of ended up like you
But my dreams are all I had to seperate me from the few, and im trying to keep my crew together tighter than the noose
Maybe build myself a future where my fantasies are true
Maaaaan
I ain't ever been on autopilot, okay I'm lyin', maybe I just had to take in the view
It's fly

[Hook]
Up higher than we ever been
Drift, Drift
Wheels up and some medicine
Don't wake me till' I arrive
Up higher than we ever been
Drift, Drift
Wheels up and some medicine
Don't wake me till' I arrive

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
You need a change in views, you need to readjust
All of them crazy tunes, to get your needle stuck
I'm breaking through the silky skyline, all of the stress on my mind
Just floats away, the world is down and I climb
I watch the lane get farther away, see my peace bring the things I seen tomorrow today
The feelings future
It spreads around this higher state of mind is quite super
Saw the girl was stupid blinded, oh my bad, did I dillute ya?
Damn
I see church road, the pavements cracked
I burnt the work code, now they won't pay me back
Get me wanting to finally lift off and holler back
And drift up over every single dot inside that almanac
You comin' with me? That'll be fine
Drop the extra bag that you got off outside of the line
This time we'll need a light body and mind to hit the throttle in time, and drift by while the comets align
Sky high

[Hook]
Up higher than we ever been
Drift, Drift
Wheels up and some medicine
Don't wake me till' I arrive
Up higher than we ever been
Drift, Drift
Wheels up and some medicine
Don't wake me till' I arrive
