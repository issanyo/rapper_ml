[Verse 1]
I did it my way way way way back in the 90’s
Back of my mind when I dropped dope lines everybody wanna run up fast and rewind me
Now please remind me what world is this that i been living in lively
Where you either walk dead talk lead
Or you just get by so calmly and blindly
It’s timely hypocrites in all sizes
You can suck me off till i’m primeless
All broken down with old liners
Living in Miami like a gutter punk primus
Like i don’t really give a fuck come find us
I swore to Ben i would serve you revenge
But i just don’t feel you’d be worth any violence
Did you really try to fuck with family bruh
I see it was damning love
That brought us pain to channel up
You son of a son of son of a bitch
I walking the line and i'm itching to trip
Unplug verse a passive attempt
At letting you know how just manic i’ve been
Which might have been a mistake
Cuz when i been out on the road
People come mention your name
And ask me to tell em your role
See i just say that i can’t
Although that i probably should
This story has innocent victims
I’m proud of the ground that i stood

[Verse 2]
I never really understood the way you gave in to lesser emotions
I would of covered you for days and days under the depths of the ocean
Well here’s my quotient
My conscience black and blue
Battered and swollen
For trusting those who were trolling
Everything i ever thought was golden
Well what the fuck do i do now
Walking strong through this new crowd
Thinking back when we knew how
Friends were suppose to be real and
Hold it down to be trill man
Bonds expected as sealed when
You broke the oath with this ill plan
Did you really try to fuck with family bruh
I see it was damning love
That brought us pain to channel up
You son of a son of son of a bitch
I walking the line and i'm itching to trip
Unplug verse a passive attempt
At letting you know how just manic i’ve been
Which might have been a mistake
Cuz when i been out on the road
People come mention your name
And ask me to tell em your role
See i just say that i can’t although that i probably should
This story has innocent victims
I’m proud of the ground that i stood
