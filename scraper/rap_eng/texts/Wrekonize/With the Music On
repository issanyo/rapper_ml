[Hook:]
We can lay it down on the table
Take this out to the lawn
If you're willing and able
Take video on my phone
Hit the lights if you wanna
Turn 'em off if you want
We can do whatever you like as long as
We do it with the music on
We gotta do it with the music on
Do it with the music on

[Verse 1:]
'Cause I need to feel you bounce to the drum
I been looking at you and it's 'bout to be fun
Gotta ounce of the yum
We can down with some rum
Whatchu you think this?
Start screaming, don't stop 'til your mouth's getting numb
Neighbour next door want us out when we're done
I ain't going nowhere 'til you shout that you...
Cum
They wanna call the cops
Because we got the volume pressed up to the meter
Took a shot of Mezcal, we living da vida
Beat the kitten up, now they wanna call PETA
Everything about you is loud as fuck
50 shades were tame, you want a million to feed the
Little Devil that you've got inside ya, screaming
Trapped inside and need assistance, FEMA
I don't wanna take you out to the club to get down
I ain't really gotta beg, I ain't feeling that proud
Just come to the crib, get it lit like now
I just gotta have the bass turned up real loud

[Hook:]
We can lay it down on the table
Take this out to the lawn
If you're willing and able
Take video on my phone
Hit the lights if you wanna
Turn 'em off if you want
We can do whatever you like as long as
We do it with the music on
We gotta do it with the music on
Do it with the music on

[Verse 2:]
'Cause nobody ever do this shit better
Took you in the backseat, fogged up the Jetta
One shot loud coming out of my beretta
Get ahead of any other broad
Trying to beat the G Code like the seventh letter
Turn a beat loud while you coming straight down now
That's what I call a goddamn go getter
You been acting insatiable
I like them old school jams in the box
Jodeci or even Marvin Gaye will do
When I put my hands on your box
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Loud
Let the record fly I'mma watch it go round
You know what it is when you're hearing that sound
Music in the background
'Bout to go down

[Hook:]
We can lay it down on the table
Take this out to the lawn
If you're willing and able
Take video on my phone
Hit the lights if you wanna
Turn 'em off if you want
We can do whatever you like as long as
We do it with the music on
We gotta do it with the music on
Do it with the music on
