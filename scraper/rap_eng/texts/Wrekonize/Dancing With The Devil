[Pre-Hook: AG Lyonz]
There's poison in the water
These smiles are watching me
Feels like a cold revolver
Like death keeps calling me

[Hook: AG Lyonz] (x2)
We're all just dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
We out here, Harlem shaking on a tight rope
Checking up the targets I might scope
Life flow kinda like the spin of a bike spoke
Hype so feverish, I'm fiending to fight, folks
I keep it inside, such a bloody polite bloke
Back room deals got me learning how to dougie
Jerking me and twerking, I can tell they wanna fuck me
Mean with it, bop with it, walk it out buddy
If it make you feel better, you can wop until you're bloody
Everybody out here shootin' to produce the-
New shit that'll choke up in your juicer
One style, still took by moochers
This is not what we meant by "Look to the future"
So easy, back it up
Dance with the devil like you haven't had enough
Black and white lines, but they just ain't adding up
I'ma two step to left, eat and pack it up cause

[Pre-Hook: AG Lyonz]
There's poison in the water
These smiles are watching me
Feels like a cold revolver
Like death keeps calling me

[Hook: AG Lyonz] (x2)
We're all just dancing with the devil
Dancing with the devil

[Verse 2: Bernz]
One foot in the church and one in the club
One sip of the blood and one shot of rum
One day of the week we like playing rough
One night ain't enough to just give it up
Playing with fire for fun, it ain't serious
Are ya'll ready to run? I'm just curious
I'm trying to get you to love the experience
As soon, you severed the piece, it's so furious
I've been out playing games with my mind
Losing my wits and bits while ya'll smile
And far from non-violent, pushing, I'm whiling
Out them to the moment that they all go silent
I hope that you realize the poison [?]
Sling shot off my hip, they always talking shit
I hope you ready cause I just won't quit
So let's two step on the edge of a cliff come on!

There's poison in the water
These smiles are watching me
Feels like a cold revolver
Like death keeps calling me
