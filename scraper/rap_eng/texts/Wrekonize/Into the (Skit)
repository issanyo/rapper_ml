[Dr. Chosis]
Ah, yes, yes, Mr. Miller
Welcome back
It's been.....quite some time since our last session, no?
It's good to have you back
I got your phone call and I know what it is that you want
But we're going to have to act fast
We don't have much time
I'm going to start the metronome now
(Metronome starts ticking)
Now you remember
You feel your body's sinking, shutting down
Shutting down completely
Where I'm taking you this time is deeper than before
I won't be able to reach you....once you're there
You're sinking down now, shutting down
I'm taking you further in there
