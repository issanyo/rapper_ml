Strange Music Inc, y'all better "let me in"
Like DJ Khaled, all I do is win
Call Travis O'Guin tell him to bring the bong
Cuz i'mma bring the weed
And u know it's strong
I'm smoking on that strong
I'm smoking on that strong
Should I roll it in a blunt or put it in the bong
I'm smoking on that strong

Come on ever-y-body get up and smoke along

I'm smoking on Kush You blocking your ears, I know that it's loud! Girls giving me looks You blocking my cock You will get knocked down
I'm Smoking on dro, u losing control getting lost in the sound
I'm rocking wit Wrek and pretty soon Tech Will know bout me now!
Hell yeah I'm Strange
Been that way since back in the day
I'm rolling some Haze In my house I got a weed buffet
Chopping down bricks like Ka-ra-Tay!
Lemon Haze like Lemonade
Sweet like a Serenade
Strong as a barricade
It stings your throat like pepper-spray
At least that's what the rookies say
I have no complaints
I'm the Willy Wonka of Weed & the Donald Trump of Yay
Ask Kanye about my weed man He said this shit was Cray
Yeah my weed is so strong like hits from Sugar Ray Ayeee!

I'm smoking on that strong
But normally I drink
Couple of shots to get it hot but i never seem to wanna stop and then I'm in the clink!
Whatever did i do, was i burning up a little mo "Green Funyun?"
It must be strong cuz all along I think I'm seeing something
I think I'm feeling something
My body's shutting down
But i don't seem to mind just please load up another round
"Morse Code Alert" Scream Â¡Mayday! at the bar
I'm in Miami Bitch, I'm tipsy acting like a star
We out at blackbird And i'm rolling out for the Sherling
They think they own the game
We push em' out like Donald Sterling
I'm toking all night long
The king, i'm choking all of y'all pawns
Shit, I'm Broken Off in the song
Find me smoking on that strong
Bitch

You say u smoke weed boy Well I smoke way more
I'm smoking on that strong It's way stronger than Thor
I know I'm the bomb That's why I'm bout to blow up
One thing I learnt from Tech is From here "It Goes Up!"
My weed so strong it makes The Hulk look like a Girls-scout
If u don't smoke weed Guaranteed you'll be knocked out
Half a gram will have you high enough to jump off your own house If u smoke my weed u will probably zone out
Cuz my weeds so strong it could kill Juicy J
And Put Snoop Dogg in a coma for a couple of days
It would make Cypress Hill feel like there no longer "insane"
Yup! all I smoke is strong Cheers to Maryjane
