[Intro: Stige]
I've been gone for a couple of days
Long enough for you to know I'm away
I know you say I'm too stuck in my ways
I always look like I've got something to say

[Hook: Stige & Bernz]
Maybe I've been waitin' for you, to save me from myself
And I say, maybe I've been waitin' for you to save me from myself
To save me from myself

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Somebody better come and rescue me, man
I need some therapy
Somebody better call the medicine man
'Cause I've been needin' me some clarity
Been lookin' all over for something to give me a little security
I'm off the rails, outta my brain, something is irking me
Everyday I've been searchin', gettin' drunk with a purpose
Goin' hard on the surface, chasin' worth got me feelin' worthless
So I've been searchin' for parties to fill up the void
I'm crossin' the circuits, I'm leavin' the grid and I'm takin' my motherfuckin' boys!
Runnin' from second-hands on a clock that gunnin' from greatness
Round the clock has got me alone and
In the box wrestlin' with all my thoughts
And I need relief, man, I gotta find a release
I need to leave, man, break out of this prison with all my G's
And if this sounds, like a stress call
Then excuse me, while I stress y'all
But this whole verse is essential, for the wellness of my mental
I've been out here, if you check y'all
No forgin' my credentials, and I won't stop if you let me
I'll just fight more, and I fend off, say

[Hook]
Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to save me from myself
And I say
Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to save me from myself
Save me from myself

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Uh-huh, yeah
Somebody better come rescue me
Somebody been getting the best of me
It’s really been quite a big mess you see
My jeopardy’s a recipe for self-destruction
I am that one man with my finger on the big red button
Ready to press it if it gets me nothing
I’ve faced depravity
At every turn it's savagery
The way the cards are dealt I feel like grabbing me
A sip of Stella
My centre of gravity
Shifts lanes so rapidly
That I can’t help but send messages back to me
Like Interstellar
What you need reasons
To come pledge your allegiance?
And come and get medals from me in a sequence
That are set up to better your weekend
I’ve got plans for us if you could just free me from my own devices
I try to turn ‘em off but go right back when I’m in crisis
So now I’m Cuba Gooding
Just trying to taste your pudding
Will somebody show me the currency; I’m sick of pulling
These ropes of Wonderwomans
To tell I lie, I couldn’t
So save me if you would…
Even though you shouldn’t

[Hook]
Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to save me from myself
And I say
Maybe I’ve been waiting for you to save me from myself
Save me from myself
