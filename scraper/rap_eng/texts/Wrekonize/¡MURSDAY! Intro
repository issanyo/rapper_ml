Making this record
And if I can be non-biased and like
Completely objectionable
Whatever the fuck

I’m from mid-city Los Angeles, California
I flew out 4000 fucking miles or some shit like that
To do this album

We go by the name of mursday
So imma need everybody to brace themselves
For some of the most amazing music you’ve heard
In the past uuuuuhhhh 40 years
Mursday [echoes to end]
