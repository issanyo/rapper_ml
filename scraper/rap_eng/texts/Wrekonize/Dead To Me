[Verse 1:]
I dreamt about you for so long
Then you went and came for it all
You hit me and it feels so hard
But then you went and broke it all off
You've been the one placing the blame
You've been the one staking the claim
You've been the one breaking the chain
I've been the one aching in pain
You've been the one hounding the stress
You've been the one scouting the flesh
You've been the one out on a quest to make me feel out of my depth
Jacques Cousteau ya hoe my wife will be aquatic
Red beanie on my head, chest full of chronic
On the rebound but not in town, now I'm supersonic
Only thing I'm certain of in this life is that you demonic
You wanted to break bread, but gave me no plate set
No butter, no cake yet you always gave great head
But now I'm ready to just guillotine ya then demean ya
Missed your misdemeanors, I just hope the break is cleaner
So, erase the codes and the contracts
Your mom in my contacts, your pop off my Comcast
You came in as one mass, but left in a contrast
How long can that con last? As long as my cards flash
I will not fall flat, my vibe is a tall glass
You're trying to stall that, but I got a hall pass
Get down and ball fast, kiss on this long shaft
Then hang off the ball sack and wait for the call back, trick

[Hook:]
You said that you felt so free
And you were so alive with me, me
You said that together we be (we be, what?)
Immortal (Immortal!)
Immortal (Immortal!)
Immortal (Immortal!)
But now you're so dead to me
(Goddammit!)
You're dead to me
(Goddammit!)
You're dead to me

[Verse 2:]
In a bucket of chains
My soul wrestles with your memory, it's stuck in my brain
In full guard, I drop off like Citizen Kane
Saying only but a word, what a sinister thang
Mmm, Gods at odds with whoever the queen is
Especially when she cut me like a seamstress
Sometimes I wanna walk away and act decent
But most the time I wanna put you in the [?]
You broke me down and sold all of the leases
Folded my goals and [?]
Who the fuck do you think you are, huh? Jesus?
You are my Sonja, I know ya [?] on Heathcliff
And every time that I try to save ya from these cliffs
You looked at me like I was riddled with diseases
I'm done trying, enough lying to me bitch
You need to lie to yourself and pick up the pieces

[Hook:]
You said that you felt so free
And you were so alive with me, me
You said that together we be, (we be, what?)
Immortal (Immortal!)
Immortal (Immortal!)
Immortal (Immortal!)
But now you're so dead to me
(Goddammit!)
You're dead to me
(Goddammit!)

[Verse 3:]
Last night I had a funeral for you in my mind
It was a beautiful affair, we had a wonderful time
We had horderves and sore words for you and your whore nerves
And laughed it up so much it made up for the torture
Forgot what the chores were, oh yeah I remember how
Let's chop up her body, dismember every [?]
[?] goodbye to this hellbound, hellish hound
Shit, good riddance bitch I'm about to get me some better now
This was a real blast like mining in eel shafts
My timing is real fast, for grinding this [?]
Letting you know, all of the things that you do to me
Turn all of the lights down, it's time for the eulogy

[Bridge:] [x2]
I've just been trying to fly and dying for you to be
High with me in the sky you're [?] do this like all of the time
And if you don't totally mind I'd like now to say my goodbyes
I'm firing your soul in the sky to never be seen by my eye

I've just been trying to fly and dying for you to be
High with me in the sky you're [?] do this like all of the time
And if you don't totally mind I'd like now to say my goodbyes
I'm firing your soul in the sky to never be seen...

You're dead to me
You're so dead to me
You're dead to me
You're so dead to me
