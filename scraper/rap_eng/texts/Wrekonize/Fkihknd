[Hook X 2]
Just because we're not alone
You echo words you've heard
You let me go just to watch me discern
Just because it feels the same, 'til the morning comes
Even roads fill the sun so cold


[Verse 1]
Another Year and I been ready so ready to be back up on my bullshit
Got the morse coders booting up for battle like we never even planned to leave the pulpit
What you doing what you planning for
You got a dream better wake for it
Cuz i’mma show these people something now
And i know that they been waiting for it
Bang but i been aiming for the badlands now
Took hiatus did an album out in badman town
Fast seller but I need more backhand sound
To the face of any naysaying back end crowd
Gimme space gimme peace gimme room to climb
On the radio you might have heard a tune of mine
And that’s progress nothing like water to wine
Cuz i been trying to reach prime now for quite some time
I been coast to coast on a mission to coast
Spread love through the clefs of these imminent notes
Feel the people on the road feeding the soul
Exchange smiles and a hug feeling regal ya know
Got a lot of road behind just as much in front
In the middle of a journey i can just take once
I can travel many miles in a matter of months
And i plan to take full full advantage
So let’s just toast to life and it’s ups and downs
Lost friendships crashed out and sunken now
At the bottom of the pile trying to climb back out
And i’m just wondering how we ever even got back round
This is a place where the path is an open door
And once you see it you’ll be begging to be back some more
From the center of this rock to indelible shores
This is a message from my soul to yours

[Verse 2]
Another Year and I been ready so ready to be back up on my bullshit
Got the morse coders booting up for battle like we never even planned to leave the pulpit
Still looking for the answers
No matter where they might come from
And if you ever hear them blasters
Then you know you need to run run
Run for the hills and them skylight rooftops
I’m banging on tabletops knocking my boom box
From kingston out into the farthest of boondocks
We king them for thinking like a free one new plots
And this is just a view that i can’t soak in
Need to see it every time to get me that roped in
I been picking up methods from my dusty past
An brush em off brand new check the function dad
I been coast to coast on a mission to coast
Spread love through the clefs of these imminent notes
Feel the people on the road feeding the soul
Exchange smiles and a hug feeling regal ya know
Got a lot of road behind just as much in front
In the middle of a journey i can just take once
I can travel many miles in a matter of months
And i plan to take full full advantage
So let’s just toast to life and it’s ups and downs
