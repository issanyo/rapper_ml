[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I wake up on a rock, that spins like hands on a battered clock
Insomniac, who'd rather watch his tattered watch turn afterthoughts
In-into a little back of props, that i'd gladly toss in shallow drops
For a chance to stop another tragic loss;
Basement words that turned astronaut
Got a black box inside my head, if I show up dead break the padlock
Give you every last thing I got, pack the box
Fax some thoughts, plus the have-nots
Tuned into the radio, what a cool and fucked up way to go
Thinking somebody might even come and save me though
I know the way this shit's sold, and it's cold

[Hook: Wrekonize]
So, we go - round and round this freak show
We know, there's more than one way we can go - seems cold
But I believe the path is chosen, chosen, I'm hoping
So, we go - round and round this freak show
We know, there's more than one way we can go - seems cold
But I believe the path is chosen, chosen, I'm hoping

[Verse 2: Bernz]
Ina-Ina-In a carousel, everything around me repeats itself
But, we don't need no help
We don't need no assistance to lead the rave - JUMP!
Will the beats prevail? And when it's all said and done will I cheat myself?
Will I leave my cell?
Or will I stay inside and pray to leave studs in my safety belt
I can't tell - If it's true what "they" say?
Is it written in the stars in God's paint?
Is it mine for the take, or is it just fool's gold that I chase?
Placed, my faith in the Ace. Down to the river and I still ain't phased
My-my-my momma said everyday, don't fret
What's yours they can't take away now

[Hook]
