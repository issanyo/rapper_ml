Silent partner...
You said you'd always be my
Silent partner ..
You said you dime to be my
Silent partner..
You said you're here to be my
Silent partner..
I see you standing bout my..
This high and so is you and I
On the grind for this wine till I'm up and die
I'm old school like that, I like the shucking jive
We point them other bitches out, how they such a blind
Hard beefer with their man out in public
We both know I'm the savior them in the flavor, now that's f*ck shit
Game is played the mentally saved based, eventually make the way
For man who live inside the..Jack
Women is such a cold and I'll make crack it
To cross without looking, the mother..cooking
They even catching..and you're in central look
Sending me home the cops is breaking my soul
And just make me over body, take it so low
I've been grateful you've been here
'cause for me you truly up the joy
We partner up so well, no need for all the f*cking noise

Silent partner
You've been hopped in me down for so long
Silent partner
Write about the mother bitches never own
Silent partner
You've been hopped in me down for so long, so long, so long
Silent partner
You said your drama wasn't cool
And so you helped me down like a pro
Take these other women back to school
You're something bout this one, she's got explicit rules
She knows no jealousy yeah, she's kind of different dude
Asking to come through and battle and so holla
But she loves my boobies in the way them numbers made their luck
I should have known from the way she dug violence
And taught me that her favorite song of mine is all we're..
It's kind of hard to hear the world when you're blinding back girl
That is girl from it's kicks to her curls
Met a million females, half of them do voodoo, yes
Ask you the rap holy I can fly with the coopersness
But there's exceptions to the rule and I'm about for that
Keep the crazy love when I'ma never get my voucher back
You'll be the dime stack, I seat back and be the beats
I'll be that look inside your eyes and we don't even need to speak

Say will meet right by my side
So if you with it, then I'm with it
Tell them hoes to step bout my business
'cause nigga..the ball never forbidden
Know they change your times, is coming stronger every time
Is put you on my mind, my spirit let the five guys
Speaking the birds as a frieze, I saw you dead at night
You're paying at no never mind, I'll pay you back with different sign
Show true love and two hugs all my choices for us
In a benz so above, all that matter is track
'cause even on a buss my drive from your touch
Got me rushing like my blood tell me finally on the..
Of my dreams then the keen..top notch
Is only right, I got my queen at the top spot
