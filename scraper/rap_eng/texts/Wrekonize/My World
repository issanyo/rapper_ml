[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
If this world were mine

I'd put the politics aside
And be grateful I'm alive
Even if it's borrowed time

Ignoring all the dollar signs
Cause the paper can deface you
When tomorrows on your mind

Life's the model on my side
And I'm trying to step it up
Cause she been swallowing my pride

Killing my will to fight
A slight homicide
Cause sometimes you need to go a little Columbine

And this some soul sacrifice to life
Guilty motherfuckers
Getting by with a half a strike

Mad men in Arizona
Who pretend the world is ending
Yeah I bet that that'll hold them

I'm a changed man looking past an old Mayan mint
Trying to find the time in which
I can get to Zion quick

I watch the sun set
And duly dub the girl a sin
I smile a lot because I truly love the world I'm in
