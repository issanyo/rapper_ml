[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I need you to be free
Whether or not it's with me
Even if it's with that scum bag in the east

I was working hard, trying to get us a piece
Of that so called dream, you were dying to lease
Pockets of lockets, the lot and the crease

People been talking about what we believe
Can't you just block them from shocking our scheme
I thought we were metal, we tore at the seams

You been a menace, you hid in my dreams
Slid in the water, when I was a teen
And I've just been trying to shake you off clean

What is this torture, what do you mean
I was so innocent, foolish and green
You were so dissonant, different and mean

Hello, I've been trying to play it on the cello
I've got a couple numbers that I can develop
When you finally let me go, I'm thinking I'm a get them

Please, breaking through walls, as if they made a scene
Battering static, I try not to scream
You've really been a world class bitch, I should leave
But I'm finding it hard just to stand off my knees

Tickets to pictures I wish not to see
Viciously bitter, you're such a disease

I've rebuilt my city from under the sea
So miss me, but call it just pity, I'm busy
Just give me a second to finally grieve

[Chorus: SOHN]
Crave is admitted to both
Flows to the surface
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Climb out the window again
Slipped on the water
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

If only for justice
If only for her
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander

If only for justice
If only for her
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander


[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I'm feeling it's cloudy
There's hundreds of Saudi's
Involved in the bounties
Of brothers, they know that are wrong

Pound me, until I move counties
And got the world bouncing
To just every one of my songs

You know that you broke me, right
It took me a decade to fix
Better the butter, for every lift
And smiles like a suffering son of a bitch

Just a runner with bricks
Tied to his legs, his neck and his wrists
Trying to climb up your chemical cliff
Without overdosing on all of your shit

I was the fool, you took me to school
But truly I want no revenge
Just gonna pretend, we never connected
And now it's due time for the end... again

[Chorus SOHN and Wrekonize]
If only for justice (fool)
If only for her (fool)
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool

Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander
