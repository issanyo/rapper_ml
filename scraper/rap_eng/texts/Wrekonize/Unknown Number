[Hook:]
It's the same story
The same story again (damn)
Last night you want a fall guy
Today you want it to end
Ya said that I should never call you again
Or talk to your friends
Or even try to knock on your door
And I can understand that
It's time to step back
But just as I was moving along
You had to text me
Who the hell is this?
I took your number out my phone the second that you split
So tell me why is it you text me
Who the hell is this?
I took your number out my phone the second that you split

[Verse 1:]
And I been trying to escape ya since the moment ya left
Gathered up your shit and patiently put it to the left
I didn't think of it but you were mostly part of the stress
The things you put me through, I don't think that my friends woulda guessed
Who coulda known it was a devil in a blue fitted dress
That got me into such a hellish place, a juvenile test
This is the shit my pops would tell me 'bout
I knew what he meant
Whenever he told me the sirens would take you to the depths
I just wish I would have believed him
Everything you did deceiving
The reason that I'll be turning off my phone this evening
Is you
Then you send me signals and they're mixed a lot
Baby left and baby got back, like Sir Mix-a-lot
Now have you ever danced with a devil in the pale blue
Or picked yourself a paradise you know you couldn't sail to
Or tried to climb a tower for Rapunzel to enslave you
I just need an exit, not the crooked road you paved, boo

[Verse 2]
And every time I think I've left you, you're calling again
It's like as if you know the moment that I'm starting to mend
You come around and bash my brains in, thank you hun
I don't know what I'd do without you, you don't let me run
I kinda find it hard to focus on my job and shit
You sneak your way into my writing like I'm Robin Thicke
But I'm not sorry love, no no, no I'm not sorry love
I keep repeating myself, well shit I'm probably drunk
And the bottle's my friend
I know you always hated whenever I bottled it in
But know I'm insane, looking at the front door, in range
Why the hell you standing in the way, this ain't a kid's game
I need a chance to get the right mind
How's about a lifetime, yeah that seems quite fine
I just need you to keep from hitting up my line
So we can keep the peace and move beyond the guidelines
