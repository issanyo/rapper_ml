[Intro:]
Ha, Cino G, I don't normally rock the remix but uh...
Today there ain't a beat I won't flip, flip, flip, flip, flip
Out here on the road on my S.O.S. shit, shit, shit, shit, shit
The War Within drops in a week get you a grip, grip, grip, grip, grip
And all the haters out there, they can get the dick, get it...

[Verse:]
There's a countrywide warrant for a man on the loose
He's tearin' stages down and doing dirty things in the booth
We need to find him quick before he fights the war that's within
Cause in July he'll just reload and do it all up again
Last seen in Santa Cruz, full of edibles, you want more?
She told me she was hardcore, then tried to ride my longboard
But I was gone already love, out in Sacramento now
Tearin' instrumentals down, trying to keep my mental sound
See I'm back again and yes I'm doing damage on a manic kinda planet
I'll be banished for my language, I'm a savage, check my status
I'm the baddest mothafucka on the mic or apparatus
Movin' through the night I'm glad it's:
Just another fuckin' reason I've been feelin' like a demon
Rockin' all night, like the sun ain't worth a seein'
Drinkin' whiskey like there's Prohibition in the region
And never sleep because I feel I'm living like I'm dreamin'
Haters thumbin' down my videos soon as they see 'em
But be all at my shows to give me pounds when I be leavin'
Been working ten years to get here, so don't you think you'll be evicting me
The only way I'm leaving here's with pockets full of victory
I get with the go, rock shows only with a fist full of flow, hit grip for the dough
I'mma spit on the foes, better be somebody with a bottle full of mix and a spliff at the do'
Gotta say "No more bongs for me!" but I still dig the odd funyun
They act like they wanna be mean all swinging fake fists callin' them Dolph Lundgren
I'm summerin' with Strangers, and hustlin' with neighbors
For the reduction of the flavor that them fucks gave you to savor
Razor Blade Boys, dicin' up the taste pace card
And TV killed the radio, web killed the stage store
Here we are - still doin' shows and we still ain't got no fucks to lease
T-dub-dub, June twenty fifth so I think it's time to cut the peace
Breakin' down, building up, everything is fucking sweet
I'mma need a second just to gather up this stuff you see that's
Way past due for spring cleaning
Take away the bullshit, searching for the meaning
Rest in peace to all the fake gangsters; so cheesy
You'll remain nameless I'll be shoutin' Gandolfini
My name is Wrekonize, let me take a shot for sayin'
Put in so much work I hope you feel the vibe's amazing
Another two albums and I'm hopin' that you'll play 'em
Before I have to go and finally make my deal with Satan, hey!
