[Verse 1]


Just got back home and the worlds gone
Lights turned off and my girls arms
Have turned into a serpent with curled charms
Pushing me away cuz i been turned long
Wake up you don’t even live here no more
We packed up your shit it’s in holes in the floor
Everyone you ever knew has grown in the war
And they don’t recognize wrekonize anymore
This is a night life nightmare charlie horse
Got me talking to the devil in a hard divorce
I want happiness and peace nothing large of course
What the fuck is you want another star to course
Well i can let you go easy breaks chains freely
Anything to get away from breaking in my CD
Working in the shop where the product is measly
"Sell a t-shirt i’ll support you believe me"
Well i ain’t come here to clothe your back
I came from mars with some bars that i wrote in fact
To get your head blown off keep your soul intact
Maybe even get ya thinking you can own the map
Ya see the time is illmatic my rhyme is emphatic i tune out the static
To challenge the king
Step off the thrown so my people can go where the food is still growing and waters in spring
You know the song
The one where everybody gets they loco on
Reality in shows none local grown
See the mob wives married to the market loan
And i’m just sitting here trying to have a real conversation
Before the cell in my pocket turns cells in my body all brown from the heavy radiation
But they just go ahead and leave me here waiting


[Hook]

I been around this world there’s things that i’ve seen
To make a honest man just give up on the purest of dreams
But i’ll be damned unless i stand against the shaded regime
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see
Ya see i've been around this world there’s things that i’ve seen
To make a honest man just give up on the purest of dreams
But i’ll be damned unless i stand against the shaded regime
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see

[Verse 2]

Another day another nightmare sweating out sheets
Studio rat steady feeding on beats
Breaking ground steady just get the nouns ready
For the epic sound levee don’t drown in the speech
Shit i got fans who down
That love what we do and that we stand around
Like i wouldn’t take the time to give a man a pound
Fuck that gimme shots lets slam em down
I seen inked up morse codes
Kicking it with family in the bottom
Like they never knew we toured though
Carrying this weight on my torso
Feels like 12 months but it’s 4 though
And it’s a carousel
I ride till i die or get a padded cell
Looking up to greats like i’m glad i held
I can only just hope to rhyme half as well
And you know the song the one where everybody gets they loco on
Reality in shows none local grown
See the mob wives married to the market loan
And i’m just sitting here trying to have a real conversation
Before the cell in my pocket turns cells in my body all brown from the heavy radiation
But they just go ahead and leave me here waiting


[Hook]

I been around this world there’s things that i’ve seen
To make a honest man just give up on the purest of dreams
But i’ll be damned unless i stand against the shaded regime
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see
Ya see i've been around this world there’s things that i’ve seen
To make a honest man just give up on the purest of dreams
But i’ll be damned unless i stand against the shaded regime
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see
There’s shadows in the dark that i been waiting to see
