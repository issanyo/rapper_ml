[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I am waking up inside a fucking nightmare
Everyone around is out to get ya, kiss goodbye your life, yeah
Still in love with ice, yeah
You silly somma bitches, there's people out here starving, check the price, yeah
What you doing tonight, yeah
I'm thinkin' bout working a double shift
My family needs the rice, yeah
Partying is nice, yeah
But I am trying to be the best
There is no time to be polite, yeah
The politics are used as a device, yeah
Tryna keep you starin' up at all the lights, yeah
I'm tunin' in and out like it's no vice, yeah
Until I realize they took away my rights, yeah

[Hook]
You feelin' boxed in, trapped, yeah
Politrix, crooked motherfuckers be like yeah
Good drink, good smoke got me like yeah
The whole time I didn't realize
Yeah yeah, this is a nightmare

[Verse 2]
My visions they be kinda out of sight, yeah
Get it up, break it down, and take it to new heights, yeah
The antidotes are poisoning real life, yeah
Don't you drink it if you're thinkin' that it's spiked, yeah
The politics are trumping us tonight, yeah
The bigots bigger when they old and rich and white, yeah
If you need me find me in the right, yeah
Cause I know how to live a realistic life, yeah
My parents moved me out into the vice, yeah
M I A we stay in dade and that's for spite, yeah
And if you got a problem you can bite, yeah
Right up on it, and then please enjoy the flight, yeah

[Hook]
You feelin' boxed in, trapped, yeah
Poltrix, crooked motherfuckers be like yeah
Good drink, good smoke got me like yeah
The whole time I didn't realize
Yeah yeah, this is a nightmare

[Verse 3]
The streets are full of people that'll strike, yeah
Whenever you think it's safe it's time to lose your Nike Airs
Everybody's tryna get a slice, yeah
They're in your back yard, rest in peace
That's word to Kimbo Slice, yeah
Maybe I should change the rhyme for spice, yeah
But I'm habitual
I'm known to do just what the fuck I like, yeah
I be kickin' shit into the night, yeah
These toys don't fill the void
I'm known to bring the joy like Mr. Lightyear
Paranoids probably yelling, think Illuminati
'Cause they see a funny shape
Bitch, you reading in too strongly
Shit, you made me lose my place, oh I was right there
Talkin' bout how everybody's all distracted by the fright
Yeah

[Hook]
You feelin' boxed in, trapped, yeah
Politrix, crooked motherfuckers be like yeah
Good drink, good smoke got me like yeah
The whole time I didn't realize
Yeah yeah, this is a nightmare
You feelin' boxed in, trapped, yeah
Politrix, crooked motherfuckers be like yeah
Good drink, good smoke got me like yeah
The whole time I didn't realize
Yeah yeah, this is a nightmare

[Bridge]
I feel it in my soul, every time I go
To the place I'm spose to go
To dream a little dream
If you find I'm in control, then please do let me know
Oh please do let me know, 'cause it ain't what it seems
I feel it in my soul, every time I go
To the place I'm spose to go
To dream a little dream
If you find I'm in control, then please do let me know
Oh please do let me know, 'cause it ain't what it seems
