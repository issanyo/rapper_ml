HOW DAT SOUND FREESTYLE

I got two tones for your head nod got some for the harder days
Still sipping that egg nog leftover from the holidays
Spoiled milk half sour feeling lazy couldn’t stack
When it’s PC everything that’s the way these pussies act
Got a gold plaque but it’s getting lonely
Need more for the epilogue
Ya’ll act real ya’ll should get a Tony
I was not aware that I met the phonies
Half past on a second stogie
Cracked Scabs acting like you know me
Black flags fly up the pole-y
Bitch I’m your master of ceremony
Got 50 more to complete the task
And I’m spitting bars like I need a mask
Oh who I am if you need to ask?
Well you can kiss my over achieving ass
Got a strange crew that can all spit
Breaking in like the locksmith
Talk sick like we toxic
An leave hostiles up in the hospice
I don’t need to do this i free for fun
Used to off the top back when we were young
But now when dudes are like "wanna freestyle?"
I’d rather lay back and drink demons cum
Music business is steaming dung
On fire but Its dreamy huh?
Looking back to where we begun
I’ve earned everything that I’m redeeming bruh
Step back pay homage
Wrek’s back to filet sonnets
Simpletons go to pray on it
I’m alt that Paganonmics
I be switching the rhythms they know I been killing them
Riding my jock and coming up off the rod like branch dividIans
Don’t give a fuck about billions
Money is nothing but dividends
Legacy’s all they remembering
So look at the circles you living in
I look at mine it’s all go gotters
Pro fresh mic phone rockers
Hope hoppers globe trotters
Elite like Tech said when it comes to us Bar None
While rookies out on the fleek beat
Are having trouble penning a bar one
Gary Larson the far one Barry Bonds all star gun
You see how long I been rocking here
Y’all know where the fuck my hearts hung
#WrekWednesdays have returned
2 down I want 50 more
Week 2 pull cartridge out
Shut down Wrek's 64
