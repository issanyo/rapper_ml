[Verse 1]
5 o'clock moving like a rattlesnake in Venice
Shedding off my monkey suit well that'll take a minute
Hold the door for me brothers and sisters it's time to jettison
The world's passing by I think it's bout time that they let us in
My medicine is like better gin
Ice cold juiced sentiments
By all means I'm meddling
With a vibe to thrive like gentlemen
If I said I'm in i meant I'm in Cuz life's short like seconds and
I don't sleep I'm on bed of pins I'm trying to live in excellence
I feel my heart pumping blood  pressure rising
Time is racing by me think a lot about my dying
I know it sounds morbid but my Scorpio is rising
And there's final destinations all around me multiplying
I'm vying finding the Mayans to ask about my compliance
With living another life and buying up all the zions
They say this life is short but I got many more to give
Shit What would you wanna do if you had 24 to live?

[Hook]
Another day another plateau
Enjoying every place that i go
This may be just a tad taboo
But let's get it like it's running past due
Another night another chateau
Enjoying every place that I go
Just get it
Ya see cuz you never know
You never know
It could be your last day alive

[Verse 2]
And if it was my last day on this spinning shrub
I'd feel above cuz I lived it up
I've broke hearts i've been in love
I've got money i spent money
I've overfed and i been hungry
Ive moonlit and I been sunny
What more could they get from me
Been to Paris been to Rome
Been mobbed up and I been alone
Been a basket case on a simple throne
Masking tape on a sinful dome
Patches holding my right to fly
Strung up fast to the light an sky
If time runs this here fountain dry
Theres a few things i'd still like to try
Jump out of a plane and in 2 minutes feel relief
Cuz life is pretty sweet
When you've just fallen twenty thousand feet
I'd like to see the northern lights
I'd like to shoot around the sun
I'd like to see more of my wife
I'd like if we produced a son
This playing field is made to kill
But we survive what a crazy deal
If you want more time better pray for real
Cuz we all ain't trained like navy seals
They say this life is short
But I got many more to give
Shit What would you wanna do if you had 24 to live?

[Hook]
Another day another plateau
Enjoying every place that i go
This may be just a tad taboo
But let's get it like it's running past due
Another night another chateau
Enjoying every place that I go
Just get it
Ya see cuz you never know
You never know
It could be your last day alive

[Verse 3]
Well what a life if i could hit that button twice
I'd stuff it like i want another strike
Trying to cut it like a butter knife
I seen things i wanna see more
Trying to cheat death on a detour
I wanna plant life Audrey's store
Like come on feed me Seymour
What you doing if you ain't living life like
To the top of cup and the light bright
You better get a ticket to the fight night
Cuz it'll hit ya when you not up night night
I ain't trying to leave quick
Trying to do the right thing Spike Lee shit
Better hold it down with a viking grip
Cuz the world moves quick with a lightning tip
I need to feel the breeze and the ease of ibiza
Soaking in all the features of being overachievers
I know i've said it before this life is truly caustic
So i refuse to be it's hostage and that's a promise
So gimme smiles and gimme fam
Gimme sights from another land
Gimme guile and gimme grand
Running miles for the modern man
They say this life is short but I got many more to give
So i'mma live it like i just had 24 to live

[Hook]
Another day another plateau
Enjoying every place that i go
This may be just a tad taboo
But let's get it like it's running past due
Another night another chateau
Enjoying every place that I go
Just get it
Ya see cuz you never know
You never know
It could be your last day alive
