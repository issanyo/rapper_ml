[Verse 1]
When the lights go dim
Everything around us begins
All the people run to get a piece of the sin
Everybody wanna be the star of the spin
And the city's full of folks that are in it just to win
Bones break fast on the chain, let em know
Indie thoughts, not today, let it go
Little boy blue, where the hell is your dough?
Look at everybody else in the same chokehold
This is space age
One mind and a faceplate
Why would anybody wanna leave they home?
Anybody in they right mind 'bout to see the fine line
I don't really think that they should roll
This world here is encased in gold
All of us are chasin' it slow
It's been years in the fears of the people in this place
I've been keeping all of them in control

[Pre-Hook]
They been on the run
Button's getting pushed for fun, you don't need air in your lungs
Take a little rum
Bet it feels nice and numb livin' underneath my thumb
Get it in, get it done
Laboring the minds of the young to make it feel like you ain't sprung
Hand over the guns
It's the new world, my son, where everybody is like one
Here they come

[Hook]
They're all around me
I feel like I've been surrounded by, cornered by, infected by
Taken over by the-
Clones, clones, clones
In a world full of-
Clones, clones, clones
Nobody is safe from the-
Clones, clones, clones
You better run from the-
Clones, clones, clones

[Verse 2]
When in Rome, you should probably just do it as the Romans did
Slaughtering the heathens on stage
Sneaking death into the city on some Trojan shit
Now who wanna get murdered today?
Got an axe packed for the fuck of it, swinging Jim Duggan shit
Cutting through the people that ain't fittin' for the mothership
Hundred million sheeple in the same damn covenant
Facebook live the event, and now you double it
All across the globe we can feel this now
Everybody's thinkin' the same
If you feel any different would you please sit down
This thing here ain't a game
If they wanna come in and control the crowd
I know what they chancin' to say
Everybody listen to this here loud
This is your chance for the fame

[Pre-Hook]
They been on the run
Button's getting pushed for fun, you don't need air in your lungs
Take a little rum
Bet it feels nice and numb livin' underneath my thumb
Get it in, get it done
Laboring the minds of the young to make it feel like you ain't sprung
Hand over the guns
It's the new world, my son, where everybody is like one
Here they come

[Hook]
All around me
I feel like I've been surrounded by, cornered by, infected by
Taken over by the-
Clones, clones, clones
In a world full of-
Clones, clones, clones
Nobody is safe from the-
Clones, clones, clones
You better run from the-
Clones, clones, clones

[Outro]
When you least expect them
They're there, everywhere
Clones
