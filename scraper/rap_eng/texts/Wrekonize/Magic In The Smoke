[Intro: Wrekonize]
Smoke
I've been trapped in the city
I've been trapped in a cell
Something's got in me
I don't feel too well
I had to get away quickly
Had to find myself
They said go to the jungle
Go drink from the well

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
And find that magic in the smoke

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Check it, check it
One sip and I lost my place
Had to give myself a minute
Had to bar the brakes
Man I felt like I was tripping and we wide awake
Then we started having visions bending time and space
It's hard to explain just when the room erased
I could tell you that it happened when I had a taste
Of that jungle water
From the local shaman
Raising smoke from the ground like a snake charmer
And I ain't ever been the same since
What was hidden I can finally see the dangers
He said "Don't worry 'cause I keep a couple angels
Looking out for you whenever you're in danger"
I ain't no saint though
But it's okay though
I walk with a thrift store halo
And by the end of the road
He'll bless my soul
So let's go

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
"I love it"

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
In a smoked out bottle
I've been known to float down to the ground
Down to the lounge
Down to the sound foundation
Down a rabbit hole
Running manic so
I'm animal
Spotted on sight, Dalmatian
Took a downtown train and
When I got to the place for the fancy occasion
They wanted me to sit pre-school shit
Like I pulled up fast with a box full of raisins
So I move to the basement
Where the shaman had a bottle for me on the mound waiting
Blessed up, best stuff, next up
And it burns chests up for the uninitiated
But we ain't no laymens
We've been taking these trips so much we can trace 'em
This a lifestyle war with the ancients

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
And find that magic in the smoke
"I love it"
"I love it"
"I love it"
