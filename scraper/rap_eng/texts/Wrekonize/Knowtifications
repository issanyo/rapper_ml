[Intro:]
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
I don't know how many times we gotta break out of this
But every time we do break out
Get any separation
It's like you just keep coming back
It's like no matter what I do
I cannot shut you down
Goddamn
Come on

[Hook:]
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know
That
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know

[Verse 1:]
That you can offer me the time
Anything I need and anything I wanna find
I'm addicted; every step I take with you is listed
Catalogued shifted
For somebody to sit with
Satellites bouncing off entire other planets
Just to let me know directions to the nearest magic
Take a couple hits then I inhale the bandwidth
To get what I need and then it's G for me to vanish
But you follow right along on my hip though
Put you back then I snatch you up off of the hip slow
Please let me be
Please let me get a grip though
Trying to sneak by ya quiet: passing on my tiptoes
Inner voices digital, hoping to resist those
Take it back, disconnect, unplug and get gone
Man I swear that you've been on me since the get go
But I can never shut you down and that's why I give in so

[Hook:]
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know
That
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know

[Verse 2:]
That you can offer me the globe
Take me anywhere, anytime I wanna go
You got me sitting here face down look at you glow
But now you've got me out here ignoring all my folks
We used to talk a lot but now we only do the quick type
'Cause I've got to get back to where I'm trending and I get liked
You die sometimes but I do find
That the right plug can bring you back so I can grind
I want more of ya, more of ya, more of ya loving
If I could find the right words I'd like to tell you something
My wife gets jealous of the time we spend
I tell her that she's paranoid, you're just a timely friend
We get it in
I can rule the world with you, that's a fact
See that's just probably why I'm checking on you back to back
And I may never stop 'cause it seems to get me round
If my people need me, they know where to hit me now

[Hook:]
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know
That
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know

[Bridge:]
That if I need you to come and see me
You're never out that far
I might as well just let you beat me
And overreach me
'Cause I'm a superstar
If I need a friend to talk with or come and talk shit
Your body can get scarred
So that it can be me and you till the world is through
And I can now call you my God
"My God, my God"

[Hook:]
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know
That
You're always turning on me
You're everywhere I go
You never let me be me
You just want me to know
