[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
If I, believed in God I'd be praying to him now but
This life, seems odd and I can't put my finger on how but
I've been walking all around looking off in the clouds with a flask in hand
Sipping on Jack 'til I cannot stand
Where the fuck am I? Goddamn it man
Shit. At peace with the past looking out into the future
I know what I'm here for but damn it can happen just a little bit sooner
I need to make more moves or, I need to work a bit harder
Do things just a little bit smarter instead of being my own personal martyr
Take another sip of the whiskey please
And if you feel the need, um, we can even split these trees but
Shit, I ain't gone lie, I don't even smoke that much no more
I get so annoyed that my throat gets sore
I be looking back at me like "why you toking for?"
But I get so bored and I get so brave
Need a change of pace, um, please queue my altered state
I wait? to the same windows some days it's the same old rain
I look to the clouds and I say to myself man "I don't think shit heres ever gone change"

[Hook]
I know something about the pain, the suffering
It's the game, it's nothing
Nearly every single one of y'all are trying to end me
Then just acting friendly
Oh I've had one too many

By the pain, the suffering
It's the same, it's nothing
Nearly every single one of y'all are trying to end me
Then just acting friendly
Oh I've had one too many

[Verse 2]
Down one, down two, down three shit
I don't even know who's down anymore
Sip crown spin round gimme raw shit
A couple more and I'mma be down on the floor
Looking round for a cure, shit what the hell happened to me?
Well it musta been a drink right? But I know it wasn't actually
Good thing to blame, I like to say that it maybe instigates
All the things that I know I get from fame
But I keep on drinking like it lifts the strain
Hey Jane, Make me king of a land with no problems
Care free with an empty goblet , get us all away from these Goddamn goblins
Comin' out of my god damn closet
Skeletons in boxes, I told these fools to lock it!
It's crazy cause I keep on waking up to the rain
Wondering when the shit gone change

[Hook]
