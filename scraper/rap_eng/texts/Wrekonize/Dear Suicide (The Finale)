Dear Suicide [x5]

(Verse 1)
I know we haven't really spoken in awhile
I joined a group, got signed to the biggest independent label while on the mothafucking grind
Years back I was staring down the line
Feeling like I would never get the time
I was looking down the barrel of the nine
And I was rocking the apparel of the N9ne
Blind to the shine of this prime-time theater who
Been showing classes, only shame is that it's pricey pay-per-view
And it's much easier to steal than to cash on mass appeal
By working daily for minimal bills with no significant skills
And so I wrote you out some letters
Never sent them, cause I learned my nerve would just return to sender
Standing on the roof of Southbeat, and feeling no hope
I sniped my dreams from miles away, the enemies with no scope
They tell us when we're young to "dream big"
We didn't know we'd do it so broke, so writing I'm looking for light in the night, I'm a go pro
The feeling inside, I don't know
I'm dying to living it so-so
So hard when death seems easier to cope so
Hello Dear Suicide...

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Top down on my mind, drop 'round on a dime
For a little of the penny for your thinking
I've been working in the mines, tryna dig a better find
Then I find that I do better when I'm drinking
But I'm so confined
When the negative is winning in the ground war
I've been winning every battle for the sound tour
I guess it's really about the people I'm around more
We grind and we rhyme, we in fans demand like one-by-one
Working 'til 5 in the morning like we don't when the sun might come
Some might run, but they strum like none
Cause to get to the top [?]
You'll be needed to be getting every bit of love you could ever take and give it all back 'til there's like none
I am that student-teacher bond, learn from anybody here, got a lesson to loan
Not really tryna end it, ya know?
I keep seeing you in the reflection of home
With no direction, I'm prone
To feel kind of like a sentient drone
I just go where they tell me to go, but I know that it's wrong in the center of my soul
So if you didn't know, then know now, this'll be the one to find them [?]
Cause I know I am better, than just to try and sever
A life I only get to live once, give it up for the ones who never
Will get the chance to go out with some pleasure, ever
Goodbye Dear Suicide...

(Hook)

(Outro)
Go ahead and let it run
Burn One
Feel like I can see so clearly now
And respect is priceless...
...
Sincerely yours...
Dear Suicide
