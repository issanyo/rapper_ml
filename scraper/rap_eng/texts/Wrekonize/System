[Verse 1: Bernz]
Downtown after-hours
That’s when I be after ours
That’s when I zone out and crumble purple flowers
That’s when I think back to all the close encounters
Back when all we had was nothing that was ours
Downtown after-hours
Hundred-thousand miles per hour
That’s when we would dream about escaping town
That’s when we would try to find an exit out
Back when we would pass it left and burn it out
Downtown making sounds
Wonder where you’ve been living now
Every time I think back from REX
Tell me where you’ve been
Tell me where you’re going to be at
Was it real or was it fake?
Was it chance or was it fate?
Were we friends or just a phase?
I’m just trying to understand your ways
Dime machines and fantasies
Ain’t giving me no peace of mind
I’m trying to find myself trying to get a small piece of mine
But if I hit rewind
You’re still on my mind
I guess it’s just an imprint that you left behind

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
Go ‘head get that out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get that out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get it out)
Get it out
Get that kick that out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get it out)
Get it out

[Bridge: Common Kings]
Keep your head above the water
Keep your head above the waves
Get it out your system ‘bout to see a better day
Go and get it out

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Better off back-turned to the accolades
Face down in the mud
Better to take turns with a hand grenade
Than to finally get that love
I’ve been a pessimistic misfit
So negative sadistic
That are better with the misfits up in the trees and getting lifted
But I’m low down
Picking up things that I cannot control now
Each day I keep it low-brow
And my life is such a showdown
So please, please feel for me these problems are my first world
And I can barely spare a second to realize the cursed world
Now back it up
Did I just say what I think I said? I’m acting up
I’m living life
With my family right
We got a roof
We stacking up
We do just what we want when we want now isn’t that enough
For us to be appreciative and super down to laugh it up?
But I am just a being suffering the human condition
That thinks the Matrix is too perfect and could use resistance
Now every time I feel like I am on a useless mission
I snap back on myself to say shoot that out your system
Listen

[Chorus: Wrekonize]
Go ‘head get that out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get that out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get it out)
Get it out
Get that kick that out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get out)
Out of your system
(G-g-g-get it out)
Get it out

[Outro: Common Kings]
Keep your head above the water
Keep your head above the waves
Get it out your system ‘bout to see a better day
Go and get it out
Get it out
Get it out
No matter how you do it
Don’t waste another minute
Aw yeah
Get it out
