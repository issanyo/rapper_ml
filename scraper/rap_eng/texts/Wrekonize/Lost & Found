[Verse 1]
Found myself in a rodeo
Got to keep it all together, got to show it go
I need to break this down before they try breaking me, breaking me
Found myself in a circus tent, wondering where the hell all the purpose went
I need to find myself before they try taking me, taking me
Me, me, I’m gone
Laid face-down in a sea of songs
Driving through a dream of dawn with the windows down and the heater on
And the speakers blown
But the beats keep me at home
Underneath this secret tone
I’ma bubble up the need to speed and get it on
It’s a skeptic’s earth
Watch out for the septic turf
Clock out, bow set to search
With a depth to birth my regrets and hurt
You’d better check the worth
I’ve got mine locked in next to burst
I shocked my watch and get to surf
This is severed first for the better or worse

[Hook]x2
If you find yourself a soul
Hold on
You’re gonna need it

[Verse 2]
Found myself in a planet rock
Where every single motherfucker seems to love to talk
If y’all are trying to let the world burn down, then that’s fine with me, fine with me
Found myself underneath the waves
Trying to battle up strangers a long ass way
I’ve got no problem being known as the beast underneath the sea, ‘neath the sea
See, see we’ve been lost, held up high on a demon’s cross
With anemic claws, and a childish need for laws
I’m bulimic, ma
Tell ‘em leave out the sweetened sauce
Give me more of that realer broth
I’ma bubble of the need to speed and get it off
Master control
Megatron this massive flow
Might be the reason every evening I’m up crafting poems
Trying to get back home
This war’s been stacked with souls
So we patch the hole and grab control for those who can’t hack the code
