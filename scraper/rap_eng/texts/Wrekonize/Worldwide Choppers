[Verse: Wrekonize]
It's.. that.. son of a stranger
With a tongue to run-a-muck over the dummies in dazes
I've been fuckin' up the suckas with no rubbers and razors
Gettin' lucky with lazors
Â¡MAYDAY! but I've been tellin' ya that nothing will save ya
I'm an animal, cannibal, I'll battle you and abandon you
I'm comin to damage you but damnit I need an avenue
This shit's, gotta be on some misfit, gotta be fuckin' bisquik
Bringin it back to bump it up and break backs
Shame that they didn't create class
Came up to the wrong math
Show me the late pass
She a tech head and she packin' a great ass
Bout to cloud it up but I'm seen out the stain glass
Killer for cinema
And I'm feeling the end of the
Get a little and give it up
I'mma winner I did it up
I'mma change up turn the shit around to blame ya
Cuz you're momma always told ya never talk to strangers!
But I've been walking with a world war way back
And mashin' up the worst I make em all go play back
They better stop me now before I go all a-crap
And make ya dig deeper for the sounds on a dad
A mini epiphany while I'm bringing the energy
Came to fame or pain got to be give me the remedy
It is insane the lane will
Be killin' the industry
Let me contain your dame while we drill the divinity
I'm a rip it up and let em say they grind
Then again I probably shouldn't save they kind
Let 'em all die and never pay they mind
Put 'em in the ground while they tryna lay they lines
Give me a second to sever the 77th amendment and I'll be workin
Wrek up an 8 or 9
Push this motherfucker back into the heyday time
Alot of motherfuckers mad now that iMAYDAY!'s signed sayin'

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
I'm light years, ahead of my peers
Want some you can come bring it right here
(Worldwide Choppers)
Can't clown me, don't come 'round me
Bow down I was crowned when they found me
