[Intro] (7x)
What-what-what-what one two one two

[Verse One]
I hit the pedal for Olympic medals
My membrane strain achin' from the pain
Truly torn me apart
But I've rebuilt and still lit a torch in the dark
You wanna rap young chap, this ain't no walk in the park
I've spit steadily while they slouch
They veggie up on the couch, I've severed everything now
I'm a homeless baby, rain tappin' on my head nearly drove me crazy
Until I realized the rain made us hope to maybe open say we wrote the pay
We all want a million to spend, lotto is luck
But I buy my ticket now and again
I'd rather Russian Roulette, then never rush in at all
I'd rather walk up the ledge, then to be stuck in the walls
I'mma dreamer with Insomnia
But soon enough I'll sell my drums and become a new demon for the popular
I like shit that's so deep it don't make sense
But if I make a beat they guarantee that it pays rent
So I hold back and pretend that I sold crack
Walk around drunk screamin' out where the hoes at
But please know that, that ain't who Wrek is
And I can't be left starvin' while the sell outs live
And if so I'll make peace with these fake ass streets
A Hollywood divorced forced over lame ass beats
I swore there was a bright light at the end of this road
But if I starve before I get there how am I to know

[Hook]
Goodbye cliche, goodbye friends
I know it's been a long time comin' but I just can't see you again
So hello cliche, hello trends
I know it's been a long time comin' but I'm so glad we could be friends

[Verse Two]
Since the beginning I've dealt with dying relatives
Ex girl drama, distractions, sedatives
My etiquette was get fucked up and ignore the evidence
I'd get so stoned alone it was hard to try and reminisce
Not next to hit, nearly next to boom
I hide from it, gettin' numb under X and shrooms
Extra room for rent in my conscious
Jimmity Cricket's on life support
Short and fed up with all the nonsense
It took Com Sense more than a decade to go plat
Tell me ya'll what kinda fucked up globe is that
Either way Earth'll meet it's day
I had my hitch hiking thumb up
I need a place for me to stay
And when I get to that planet of peace
I'll try to live out my life without demanding a piece
Human nature's a plague, off pain it'll thrive
When I change ya'll remember goodbye

[Hook]
