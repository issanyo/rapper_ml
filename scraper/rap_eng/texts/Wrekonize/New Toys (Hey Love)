[Hook]
Hey love
I know that you're far away
Every night a different place
Hey love
I'm just writing you to say
Hey love

[Verse 1: Bernz]
Lately been living this life that's trife, poltergeist on mics
Light a spliff and if it burn quick I roll twice the vice
And if God's precise, how the fuck we survive these nights
Getting faded for paper and sharing some bad advice
I toss my life, regrets to the air like dice
Pound pavement, I aiming to faded to get by
Six puppets tryna get fly, waiting on standby
Sleeping inside a coffin and coughing the whole drive
New city, same diddy, Santa Cruz to Philly
Will he or won't he, I'm only speaking my truths really
Apprentice to a master, oh yes, a master
I blatantly studied the craft with youthful passions
Fashion come and go, I'm trying to feed my soul
I done paddled the wind and upped the Atlantic coast
Pirates sailing the roadway drunk from my last toast
My lady tucked me a note in the bag where I packed my coat and it read

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Lately been living this life that's trife, poltergeist on mics
It's like I'm  taking half the caution with twice the vice
It's so real
And at the same time illusion
I thought this was a dream somebody check me for contusions
Working these little clubs for minimum of the buzz
Was digging into my love, for the pyramids above
But I kneel, and continue to spin the wheel even if it only gets me the promise that I can still build meals out of doing what I love and treat it like a drug
I gotta leave again I know it's rough but, keep me in your memory wherever I go
And I'll be sure to send you snapshots develop my soul
I'll, I'll just develop my soul
To keep the devil below while we just pedal for home
Pirates sailing the roadway drunk from my last toast
My lady tucked me a note in the bag where I packed my coat and it read

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
Lately been livin’ this life that’s trife, poltergeist on mics
Makin’ moves down in Miami it’s twice the vice
Movin’ coast to coast yeah I lamp and boast
Dark days to late nights I’m playing  the host
Consummate Jimmy Fallon
Remember when I was whylin’
Bringin’ broads on the bus and makin’ em Long Islands
Smilin’ becomes secret  Secrets become memories
Can’t remember her face but already missin’ her energy (damn)
My woman tonight
Seems like every other week she gettin’ put on a flight
Need some good in my life, never put up a fight
If I wasn’t already married she could be my wife
But alas it’s just dream
As I’m passin’ through your scene
Shame on my dirty dick but the cash is still clean
Pirate sailing the roadway drunk from my last toast
My lady tucked me a note in the bag where I packed my coat
And it read

(Hey love)

[Outro]
There's always this ¡MAYDAY! van parked and I can never get my car in there
Who the fuck is ¡MAYDAY!?
