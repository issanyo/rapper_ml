[Chorus 1: Wrekonize]
The time we had, the lies, the laughs
The fights for cash, the miles of broken glass
I will, I will let me let (go)

The beast, the war, the need for more
The dream to tour and leave this at your door
I will, I will let me let (go)

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Let me just go, get it going
How can it be even when you're screaming in my dome?
Stab me with a needle, now I'm bleeding on my palm
Shoulda known you was a clone from day one

Shooting stars now get this comet on the phone
Tell her this ain't worth even the skin up off my bones
Head is but a speaker and your feature's nearly blown
Stress? No. Hey pharaoh, get grown!

Hold lone star riding on a soul train
Dirt up off your feet keep falling on my own name
Singing out of key probably praying that the tone change
Swinging from E to a canopy of cocaine

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
This is a minimum no show
Bouncing pogo stick keeping it low pro
Feeling of "Oh no, shit, he gon' leave" so
Grab a hold of any piece of me that you can bleed slow

[Chorus 2: Wrekonize]
The TV set, the cigarettes
The disrespect for a little get-get gone
I will, I will let me let (go)

The deadly cold, the debt we owed
Cos you were on that blow
I will, I will let me let (go)

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Let me just go, get it going
How can it be treason if I'm seated in the throne?
Bring me into Eden while I'm bleeding all alone
Shoulda known you was a clone from day one

I met you back on some matter of fact
Friend of a friend let's get together and chat
She had eyes like a sorceress, better than that, so
We got it locked and now you can't seem to let me (go)

Ring the alarm
I been burned by a snake with a similar charm
Got to learn my escape, keep a vigilant arm
And run 'til I see the sunrise over the morn, I see it

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
This is a minimum no show
Bouncing pogo stick keeping it low pro
Feeling like "Oh no, shit, he gon' leave" so
Grab hold of any piece of me that you can bleed slow

[Chorus 3: Wrekonize]
The time we had, the lies, the laughs
The fights for cash, the miles of broken glass
I will, I will let me let (go)

The beast, the war, the need for more
The dream to tour and leave this at your door
I will, I will let me

The TV set, the cigarettes
The disrespect for a little get-get gone
I will, I will let me let (go)

The deadly cold, the debt we owed
Cos you were on that blow
I will, I will let me let (go)

[Outro]
(Go)
(Go)

Let me let go (go)

(Go)
