[Intro: Wrekonize]
I'm walkin' the line...
I'm walkin' the line...

[Verse 1: Big Scoob]
Heavy head as I sit and write, my mental scattered everywhere
My thoughts are all jumbled up, a cluster fuck, in despair
My life is such a bitch to bare, the smoke seems to never clear
Takin' calls, helpin' y'all, but when I fall, nobody's there
They tell me life ain't ever fair, tell me that my heart is rare
Tell me how I'm livin' is forgiven if I practice prayer
Wishin' I was unaware, livin' life without a care
Rollin' through the hills on bad wheels, I ain't got a spare
Fightin' but I'm ill prepared, a titan tryin' to hold my square
Enlightened, kinda frightened with the sights as I become aware
Hold the elevator, second thought, I'ma take the stairs
Struggle as I'm getting there, embrace the journey I ain't scared
What they sellin' I can't hear it, I'm rebellin' that's my spirit
Kinda groggy, not the clearest, pourin' whiskey, somethin' serious
A penny for my thoughts, then all these thoughts is bought
Continuing this walk, just hoping I ain't lost

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I got trouble on my mind
They keep tellin' me that it'll be just fine
I'm walkin' the line (I'm walkin' the line) I'm walkin' the line
I've got so much on my mind
They keep tellin' me that it'll be just fine
I'm walkin' the line (I'm walkin' the line) I'm walkin the line

[Verse 2: Big Scoob]
This news on this TV, depressin' as a muh'fucka
Thinkin' its just TV but its real as a muh'fucka
Shit done really hit the fan
Everybody show they hands
Choose a side, where you stand?
Plant your feet and be a man
Liberty and justice for all like Mamma Yates say
"Niggas, we ain't fuckin' with y'all" I'm hearin' them say
It's cool if you don't fuck with me
Just let me know what it's 'bout to be
So I can be the monster you devils make me out to be
My country 'tis of thee, we the brave and the free
But its clear that you lied to me in different times where we ain't free
From slave to the white house
Gettin' paid, then a nice house
You can stay, watch what you say, behave keep a tight mouth
You're opinion's one that's given, just be thankful how you livin'
But my soul ain't for sale, only God can do my biddin'
In the country built on violence, they surprised that you're violent
Just surprised how you hide it, and despise how we silent

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I got trouble on my mind
They keep tellin' me that it'll be just fine
I'm walkin' the line (I'm walkin' the line) I'm walkin' the line
I've got so much on my mind
They keep tellin' me that it'll be just fine
I'm walkin' the line (I'm walkin' the line) I'm walkin' the line

[Outro: Big Scoob (Wrekonize)]
This the shit I'm dealin' with, reality I'm livin' with
Spill it on the page, use the rage for my benefit
(I'm walkin' the line)
Born and bread, I can take it lord don't let me get complacent
That's the prayer that I say at night, take my pen and sit and write
(I'm walkin' the line)
