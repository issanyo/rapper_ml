Intro:

Yeah, liquid assassin, mongrel music I see ya

Wrekonize what up?
Its your boy Black P

First Verse: Black Pegasus

For all you non-believers like an atheist bitch
Till I show up, like the profit on the craziest shit

Look what this rap shit done got us in
(Look), In the game, we’re known to rap 4,2 even more than Jackie robinson

You see liquid, grippin the pump, then don’t sleep on our bars, like a belligerent drunk

I got that cocaine flow, if your sniffin it once
You get so damn high you’ll stay lifted for months

(Yeah/Uh) I’m slappin amateurs, I’m punching managers
They know I’m nice with the hands, no manicure

Pull out the canister, hold on the banisters
Ill take you back to Jeru Da Damaja

Cause you bitin, with all those freaking fake styles
You’re playing yourself like Eminem in 8 mile

Its Black P, BKG, Russian roulette with six bullets if you play me

Chorus x 2:

Listen, these bars written
Easily hard as prison
It spit em, ignite a fire, and light up like a prism
Let em know,  every word in the verse will shine
Word then my 60 measures, so verbal, murk every line


Verse 2: Wrekonize:

Gotta moment to listen, my inner visions of time
Can make it sinister, rippin, this given when I decline
Your existence, that I be moving on to shifty livin
If you plan on even slippin by these prisons we be buildin

Man lays brick, brick lays down foundations
Downtown, sound station for this proud nation

Build it up to let it fall, letter to the laws
Breakin everything we knew was better for the cause

Assassinate your character, prepare for liquidation
Introduce you me to Satan. I’m really tired of waitin

We hit the road so much, I know the feel of rockin round
Shows every single night. When I get back to solid ground

I’m going to build me an entourage
Ha, and storm your monologues until we see what’s left is merely holocaust

Me and liquid assassin whether the prisms
Listen these bars written and aiming for better livin

Chorus x 2


Verse 3: Liquid Assassin

I’m an armed assassin; I’m on more ratchets with arm attachments
I bear arms like a grizzly claw, arm attached to it

These bars are battling, words I acrobatically flip
Have a damn amateur caliper? rap a casket fib (something in here is obviously wrong)

Nice with the words, put em together then versus it
Playing in these bars, feel every word in the verse stick

Difference between me and some faggot rappers I’ve versed with
My gun bust, stretch you pussies out like some virgins

Discharge the Rugar, rip apart your medulla
Break every bone that’s a part of you with a bullet

Bullet leave your brain ruthless, I pull it
It will leave your head fucked up, like your head carved to a mullet

I clap rhymes for applause, focus and post it
Hopeless with rap then back to hittin licks like postage

Logic to me, cut your body like a lobotomy
Try to body me, you goin’ be a body, allotted me

Chorus x2
