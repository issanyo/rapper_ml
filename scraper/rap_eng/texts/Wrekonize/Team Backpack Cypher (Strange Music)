When the ship sets sail, and we're out here getting mail
Strange Music takes me all around the world
And I'm known to get it crackin' what, gettin' active what
Bitch I'm on first swing, everybody better tally up
Just look ain't hard to find me
I'm a make a couple niggas rewind me
All my life young nigga been rhyming
Bout time young niggas start shining
And you know them hoes be hyme
When they see the nigga on they line
These haters always whining
All the while Tech N9ne and them signed them
And i got that loud bitch, yeah
I got that loud bitch
Fuck what the haters say this swisher mix I'm taking now bitch
Ain't gonna be more questions if or when, lets talk about how rich
Anybody wanna compete when I got em in reach, unleash that pound shit
Bombing with my, renegade I'm a bring a nigga whip fire
Heat seeker bullets spray when I bring em out
Got a nigga pissed off and I can't lie
Roll on em, unchained nigga untied
What it feel like with a some some
Up in Denmark then Hong Kong
Grown ticks gon' say that your far from
Strange saying mother fucker hit a home run
You can have that, you can hold that
All i really wanna know where my dough at
Paint pictures on the track Kodak
From the middle of the map we know that
Naah
From the middle of the map bitch know that
One Stone my zone you throw back
Two clips all out reload that

[Wrekonize]
Open up the vein get a bit insane better train
Jane to be shelling me in sentimental cellophane
Wrek is aimed higher than the heavens on a weather vane
Better stay ready man if you sleeping get a lane
Fuck it, Imma freestyle this
Wrekonize doing it for the love
And out here in LA at the Globos
It's kinda like a comedy club
I was suppose to write a verse but I did about 3 freestyles in the last 3 weeks
And I don't give a fuck and they don't give me the respect I fucking ever ever need
My name is Wrek, Yes and I got an album
Shit's called The War Within
Oh did I say my name?
I guess I gotta take another shot of Jack
And then another shot of Jack Jack again
Hey now we gotta rap on the (blue bus?)
And that's how we gotta do it now
My name is Wrekonize
Came to LA Los Globos to tear down on the crowd
I got Bernz on the side
Got Kaliko on the back and Stevie and they riding wit me
Let 'em know Summer of Strange
Little freestyle now I had to get busy

[Bernz]
Who’s really watching? When I walk down Collins?
Zombies everywhere, junkies in the air
Tryna get a little bit of pills for popping
I’m just asking, who the fuck behind all these flashes
Street lights on my block
Got a Cyclopes watching everything that passes
Black mask is my fashion, got to hide my face from harassment
Paranoid that I can’t avoid them boys when it’s time to get my head bashed in
No relaxing, just action, what else am I supposed to say
Can’t talk about God when the laws of the jungle are all that I see every day
Fake get blamed for the fame and the fall
But the eyes on the wall see it all
And that was an algorithm used for profiting
And all they can do is pray on
While we preyed on, bombed, and Trayvon
And keep yelling player play on
Well the satellites take it all down like a motherfucking house of cards
I’m on that different shit, unplug me quick
A fifth of whiskey, ain’t an am at this
Rolling up the list till the black is list
Putting nickel up and I’m snapping pics
Of flicks twice I live, one for [?]
Motherfuckers want to get [?] night
Bring back some of the strange motherfuckers and it will be all right
Get a night light

[Krizz Kaliko]
I make it rain on them, only if they got the same name on them
Snake and a bat, you ain’t got ask he got his chain on him
Don't claim no game even tho' got his flame on him, shame on them
Excited, invited them so we came on them (KALI BABY)
Suited and booted ready for baby to toot it if she
Cute then I ruin her, the money’s why they pursuing them
I don’t save' em but give 'em a little taste
And if you ain’t got no money then get the hell out of my face
Listen, me and Wrek and Bernz and Stevie Stone, so leave me lone
Impeccable with words, give me give me weed then leave me lone
Some of them strange touring, it be on when he be home
And if you never seen me then goddammit turn your tv on
