[Verse 1]
Ha
I need you to be free
Whether or not it's with me
If it's with that scumbag from the East
I was working hard tying to get us a piece
Of that so called dream you were dying to lease
Pockets of lockets the louden the crease
People been talking 'bout what we believe
Can't you just block 'em from shocking our scheme?
I thought we were metal we tore it to seams
You've been a menace, you hid in my dreams
Slid in the water when I was a teen
And I've been just trying to shake you off clean
What is this torture? What do you mean?
I was so innocent, foolish and green
You were so dissonant, different and mean
Hello
I've been trying to play it on the cello
I got a couple numbers that I can develop
When you finally let me go I'm thinking I'mma get 'em
Please
Breaking through walls as if they made a scene
Battering static, I'm trying not to scream
You've really been a world class bitch I should leave
But I'm finding it hard to just get off my knees
Tickets to pictures I wish not to see
Viciously bitter you're such a disease
I rebuilt my city from under the sea
So miss me
With all of this pity
I'm busy
Just give me a second to finally breathe

[Chorus - SOHN]
Crave is admitted to both
Flows to the surface
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool
Climb out the window again
Slipped on the water
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool
If only for justice
If only for her
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool
Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling this cloudy
There's hundreds of Saudis
Involved in the bounties
Of brothers they know that are wrong
Pound me until I move counties
And got them all bouncing to just every one of my songs
You know that you broke me right?
It took me a decade to fix
Peddled the butter for every lift
And smiled like a suffering son of a bitch
Just to run it with bricks
Tied to his legs, his necks and his wrists
Trying to climb up your chemical cliff
Without overdosing on all of your shit
I was the fool
You took me to school
But truly I want no revenge
Just going to pretend
We never connected and now it's due time for the end
Again

[Outro - SOHN (Wrekonize)]
If only for justice
(Fool)
If only for her
(Fool)
Don't be a fool
Don't be a fool
Give away that card
And take all that I've got
Don't let me wander
Don't let me wander
