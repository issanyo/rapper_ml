[Intro: Bernz]
Oh my God, you're so nasty!
Ladies and gentlemen! C'mon!
Yeah (x4)
One-two
[?]

[Verse 1: Bernz]
It's so pretty, warriors dance, the audience claps
Veteran minds, the ladies in hot pants
And how you that-that, I'm on my "Who that?", y so so
Get them off the stage before he chasing with shell toes
I got a good feeling I'm a bad example
Got a bad bitch back stage with my sample
Man will serenade, my favorite drink's lemonade
Get me in the vibe and you'll see just how good it tastes
Sweet as molasses, [?] in all fashions
Junk yard dog shit, can even smoke your ashes
I like the fast shit, fast money and fast cars
That's the type of shit that'll probably make my dick hard
And don't check bitch, I'm ready
Catch them by surprise and get them right before they get me
Fuck a warning shot, I'm gonna let the cannons pop
Don't nobody know to dance, before they hear a drop

[Hook: Wrekonize]x2
Don't count us out (count us out)
I ain't heard a bell, I've got seats to sell
Y'know you might as well have fell, but I'm alive and well

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Here's another tale of a dominant male
Giving mommy some ale, rocking with Obama at Yale
I mean Columbia, pulling out the solid ground from under ya
Sorry slut, better run and duck when your number's up
Breaking bread like I never knew it was sliced now
We're making records for both the black and the white crowds
So put the mic down, I mean like right now
I'm killing hype crowds, while you're killing the mood
I'm just a local entertainer, who keeps the stranger family
But you don't understand, God dammit, you're Casey Anthony
Murder
Imma be polite while I'm serving ya
That old school British talk, Eastern Suburbia
Back to the West then, cracking a yes men
Stackin' a next gem, your raps been a mess, man
I need a moment now, let me take a breather
Fakers all around me, but I don't need them either
If you need me, you can find me in Hell
Making wishes in the well, I ain't hearing no bells
She's got Â¡MAYDAY! up, all mores code tatted
Skywalker flow, with a force so tragic

[Hook: Wrekonize]x2
Don't count us out (count us out)
I ain't heard a bell, I've got seats to sell
Y'know you might as well have fell, but I'm alive and well

[Verse 3: Garcia]
Standing by the bar with a gun in my pants
Shorty flirting with her eyes while she hugging her man
Shacking my plans, check-check the mic for the fans
Gotta reup on my works so I'm holding a grand
Double up the money, Mr. hand over fist
I hit the door twenty deep, and we're not on the list
Headless, limitless, proceed death with a kiss
Tisk-tisk, no shit, left my chick with a cyst
Pain runs deep and that's why I gave her no sleep
Call me more, but I ain't happy 'til I'm watching her weep
Tears of joy, freaky nigga by the [?], poodle
Ain't a noddle like it's dipped in soy
Just me and my boys being part of the bar
Chop sticks have some bitch eating Mr. Wong
Got some low cut jeans, exposing her thong
And I won't stop until the spleen is on the tip of my schlong
Am I wrong?
Nah, I don't think so (x2)
Yeah, God see it
