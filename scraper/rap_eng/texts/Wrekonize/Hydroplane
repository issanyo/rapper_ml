[Hook: Wrekonize]​
Sunday climbing high inside of my domain
Not working I'm just trying to find a sky to claim
My city's the committee for the finer thangs
Why complain we can hydroplane
Sunday climbing high inside of my domain
Not working I'm just trying to find a sky to claim
My city's the committee for the finer thangs
Why complain we can hydroplane

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Living in a city where the people get busy getting busy like it ain't no
Thing to pick a dream when you living in a scene where it's difficult to lay low
I been on the lamb trying to give a damn but I can't jam to the silence
M-I-A the land feel another gram hand been crammed full of vibrance
And a tad of the violence jumped in by the parkway pirates
See I been ala the kazam trying to slap it to the man and stay a pillar for the silent
What you here for the mileage
A Frequent flyer running for the pilots cockpit to talk some shit you bias
I can freely see and read it in your iris
Go an button up your eyelids we here to party up and down for the highest
Whether you atheist, a crazy clique, or even for the meek or the pious
They try to roll right by us like we wouldn't come and call the alliance
I try to keep on mine but sometimes ya gotta slide it ain't a perfect science but I'm vibing

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]​
Yeah everybody in this bitch running round downtown covered in the powder
I been looking for a flight up in my cup I can try and climb out of
Chugging since I was a chum and
Drugging Trying to swing the wood around like Jim Duggan
Something can be full of nothing if you break it down enough and give it all up youngin'
Inhibitions killed with a bit of skill you can even take more hostage
Sip lisinopril flipping with the real son of god hanging on crosses
Gotta get to cutting these losses finding friends face down in the phosphorus
It's that Son of a son of a bitch running up into the mix trying to double cross us
How freaking obnoxious but if you stay alive you can be prosperous
If you slide with the right tide you can flip it now and dive with the walrus
Trying to thrive like all us
Fitting in with the hoods and the ballers
I try to keep on mine but sometimes ya gotta slide it ain't a perfect solace but it wants us
