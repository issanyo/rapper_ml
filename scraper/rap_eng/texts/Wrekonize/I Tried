[Intro: Wrekonize]
I'mma keep tryin', I'mma keep tryin'
I'mma keep, keep

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I've tried to keep in touch with the ones who fight for a purpose
I've tried to keep pretending at daily for commercial circus
I'm tryin' to see the planet before we destroy its surface
And fall in love with anything that makes me feel nervous
Relax, know I'd try that only define the worthless
Have my peace in no sleep and no sleep when shit seem like surfence
Rappin' me up and holding me back in the conscious coverings
So I rised daily then make title way type disturbance
I've tried to topple trends and follow originality
And breath my philosophies across the distant galaxy
Hit with gravity my soul looks behind your salory
And takes pity on liars who tired of system's sanity
Envision family, huddle around place of dysfunction
But I refuse to eat to fit in and now my stomach's rumbling
They want us to slave away the eat before our own destruction
But I'm tryin' to fix all that before my heart's stops pumping

[Hook: Wrekonize]
I've tried to build the base of fans for my music
I've tried to rid myself of pull that seems useless
I've tried to find the love actually worth finding
And if I don't succeed today, tomorrow I'll keep trying
I've tried to reach my dreams without stepping on people
I've tried to get props without growing an ego
I've tried to live my life as in example why
And if I don't succeed today, tomorrow I'll keep trying

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I've tried so many different approaches to reach my dreams
But each time I try to watch for them people were blocking the screen
And it seems those closest to me cared more for other needs
If you carry guards for the occasional time that brother bleeds
Did you love? Yeah, I've tried that, but three isn't more
Belize on her lack of commitment brought tears to my jaw
And now I'm stucked with memories appolege three hardcore
And the truth about multiple men bringing the pants to the floor
Some people try fall in love in only for face flat
Some people try to tell the truth but just can't relate facts
Most types of liars I have alliterate when I lace wax
A thirst for the vision of rhythm that's why I taste tracks
I tried to stay off of the sharks swimming under my bluff
It's been positive so it's not to see my brother in cuffs
I'm naming that success and I know that hustle is rough
And I'm still trying like there's no such thing as struggling enough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Barabis]
I've tried time after time, time and again
I've tried to bring life to the thoughts of dead men
I've tried but all my effort seems so effortless
I've tried talking to God, he ain't listen, I left messages
I've tried but when the world turns starts spin like the exorcist
I've tried now when they say my name, they say it with emphasis
I've tried and never failed but now my soul's fried
So now I question whether or not I wanna be alive
I've tried 24/7, 365
I've tried minimum wage 9 to 5, hurt your pride
I've tried most of life escapes it then for suicide
Now my cold world's blooded from the night the Earth cried
I've tried to see eye-to-eye off, follow the blind
I've tried to give mankind the piece of mind
I've tried to make it in life in music they inner twine now
This music I mind, remind your children to rewind

[Hook]
