[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Shades on my face, DCs on my feet
Walkin' through the dirt 'cause there's disease in the streets
Get it up, get a little bit of toxic fumes
In the middle of clot that's doomed
Fiddle with a riddle, watch it boom!
In a sizzle on whatever block you choose
Droppin' off bombs in the shopping mall
Takin' out the excess mess, yes let's get it poppin' y'all
Am I fazed by them? Not at all
'Cause haters don't know dick
If they don't posses the cock and balls
This is Egypt, Tunisia, Libya
Hold your people down, snatch the crown then get rid of ya
If you've been corrupting this dog pound, giddy up
Bottom feeding fucks probably stuck with Chlamydia
I've been seeing a trend from beginning to end
Better tell your friend
Gon' be sucking a benz and then stem and
Send this letter that I’m writing with a strangers pen
They trippin' acid if they think they gettin' me muzzled
Cobra Kai sweep them high and watch their fuckin' knees buckle

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
Load 'em up and let's go riding through the badlands
It's the beginning but it's feelin' like the last stand
That's why we lighting up the tires and the gas cans
'Cause it's about to go
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
It's goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Bernz]
I hate your guts, good morning, how you doin'?
This everyday, that's how we fucking do it
I'm- I'm out the door, if not we both movin'
That bullshit that you're talking's foreign
I'm not fluent, how do these fakes do it?
This shit ain't natural, if you are from the future
Then where's your capsule? Bastard
I finally mastered and plaster-casted the name
My moments runnin' much faster so thinking about's a waste
Face-plant, she in my lap, digging for some more cash
Sinking deeper than that, hoping to raise up her stats
You fuckers bending facts, you never did all that
You never took over cities and grinded with the axe
Nothing but stray cats scratching each other's backs
Scratching the surface of the glass house, where you at
Y'all just some mice and now this my licence to ill
It's going to be fight or flight when they lighting up that still

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
Load 'em up and let's go riding through the badlands
It's the beginning but it's feelin' like the last stand
That's why we lighting up the tires and the gas cans
'Cause it's about to go
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
It's goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

[Bridge: Tech N9ne]
If we're summoned then we're gunning
Thirty round drumming, now you're done in
It'll be stunning when we comin'
When you front is when we runnin'

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Do you Soowoo? Do B-lue? Who crew you choose?
I don't give a damn about the color in the shoes
Only how many real niggas I can use
When the demons get to fiendin'
White wings on the king has been steaming
'Cause the green everything is really meaning
Lusting for the cleaning
By the angels, bang hell to the motherfuckers became frail
Can't tell you're the mane, your reign fell
Find the witches, dine the wicked, tryin' to get it in
If rhymin' is this kinda cryptic, slime to dismiss, I'm acidic
Bismillah, in a minute, voilà, you’ll be in darkened days
Where the people don't ride Maybachs, they packin' sparkin' K's
I'm talkin' 'bout you uppity niggas, I been around that for years
I'm the righteous, nicest, light for the fight and the killer right here
Down with your mad clan, bow, kiss your dad's hand
I-X my flesh, now get your last brand
Call me a mad man, and I welcome you into my badland, huh

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
Load 'em up and let's go riding through the badlands
It's the beginning but it's feelin' like the last stand
That's why we lighting up the tires and the gas cans
'Cause it's about to go
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down
It's goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
