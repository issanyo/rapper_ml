[Intro: George Spits]
“You gon’ do this again?
Every single time it’s the same shit
Like c’mon yo ain’t you getting tired of this?
There’s nothing wrong
There’s really no reason to make this out bigger than it has to be right now
Just go ahead and relax
Sit down
Take a deep breath
Alright?
You always do this!
You always do this yo
You always go too hard
You’re doing too much
Please just relax”

[Verse 1: Bernz]
It’s like it’s never enough
You want space but you ask me to come
You’ve got plans but you ain’t in a rush
You care less but you’re feelings are crushed
I don’t even got to blame it on a cliché complex
Take a step back and review the context
You won’t catch me saying daddy caused this
That ain’t no excuse for the constant bomb threats
I met you in the club with the speakers bumping
Didn’t take long to become something
We’re both crazy so I saw it coming
Argue at the bar right before we fuck and
You gon’ start up a scene
As a part of routine
Try every damn thing to get a rise out of me
So keep doing what you want ‘cause I find it sexy
But when you go overboard sometimes I freeze
And say

[Chorus: Bernz]
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
I’m under pressure
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Extra extra
I’m under pressure
You’re always so extra with me

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Yeah you got a big mouth
Big mouth
Who are you to get the clips out?
This route might have put me in her dip now
‘Cause you’re always all messed up actin' like a bitch now
I’ve been standing over here like the perfect man
Laying down cuts like a surgeon ma’am
Anything that you need I would D but you still wanna take me out like Franz Ferdinand
My past sins always up in conversation
Like my past life lived it was just abomination
You ain’t God, this is off, what an odd
Little woman what exactly is your latest compilation
I let you get me with the copulation
I should have shut you down when I got the patience
But I never had another try to give me so much
Just stop it’s a lot for me to take in

[Chorus: Bernz]
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
I’m under pressure
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Extra extra
I’m under pressure
You’re always so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
I’m under pressure
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Act so extra?
You act so extra
You always act so extra with me
Why you acting extra?
Extra extra
I’m under pressure
You’re always so extra with me
