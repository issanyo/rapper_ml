[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Break down the barrier
Barbed wire, barbarian
Plague carrier
That'll grab and ravage any savage or mariner
Take his bride to being batterer
Just to damage you
Man handle peace with the darkest of intentions
The King James', King Henries, King Williams
It's royal business, so let's make a killing
Yeah, I'll trade some shillings
For men, women and children
Cause the sunrise is mine now
The language and the time, wow
You might as well just lie down
I've got human beings, being
Souvenir things
Collect them all to rule the whole kingdom
And I'll be passing it down
The bloodline, crime fam inherits the crown
No matter how incompetent, we hand it around
Just to keep it in the family cause

[Hook: Wrekonize]
They never thing of the blood
They'll bury souls in the mud
Just to live one day as king

Gamble motive with love
Murder spirits above
Just to live on day as king

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Don't even think about treason
Cause all traitors can trade freedom
For breathing
I've killed so many for much less
It's stress relieving
And when you rule the region
Shit, who even needs reasons
Welcome all subjects and fools
Roughnecks and tools
What do I even need to do
Inherited the throne
And all the evil with it too
See I've been burying the hope
And host that you don't seek it too
They pray to god, we pray too
But on the weaker souls
And put a sleeper hold
On tortured souls we keep below
We all breed for the crown
My blood is even cold
Cold enough to stay liquefied in the freezing snow
Some will kill for the crown
Some kill to wear it
Some follow it with blinders
Others seem to grin and bear it
Some say the human being can't work without a lead
But it seems to work as well when they bleed

[Hook]
