[Intro]
Two, Three, Numb
Hey
Feels like a good place to end it
Yup
Feels good, Numonics
I like this one
Hey (come on)

[Verse 1]
In this land of milk and honey
They've both been modified to make me still feel hungry
I'm feelin' funny like I'm on somethin'
Like I was inside out but my emotions pressed the wrong buttons
Trying to spit big, a bit of the Chris Wallace
But the pressure that's normally systolic
Is rising like a crisp rocket
And I ain't gotta wrist watch that'll keep time
With a sick clock it's
Now or never
See tomorrow don't get promised
Was in the hospital with blood bouncing
Most of my friends still don't know
'Cause I ain't take the time to post about it
When do we find the time to socialize?
I mean really, like really socialize
The web is where the social dies
I miss the days in Hollyhood like kinda, kinda
Not sure exactly why
'Cause back then the vibes were really not much kinder
Sometimes my mind resets where it begun
As a kid I was sensitive, today I'm grown
And I feel so numb

[Hook]
This was supposed to be fun
'Cause we don't ever back down from challengers where I'm from
Wielding machete, hit the ready, Novocaine on my tongue
It's awful hard to feel any when you're basically numb
Come on
My sins are soulfully young
'Cause we don't ever grow bitter in the age that I'm from
Wielding machete, hit the ready, Novocaine on my tongue
It's awful hard to feel any when you're basically numb
Come on

[Verse 2]
In this land of milk and honey
They both been modified to take my human rights from me
I'm feelin' funny like I'm on somethin'
Like I was inside out but my emotions pressed the wrong buttons
Trying to spit big, a bit of the Chris Wallace
But the pressure that's normally systolic
Is rising like a crisp rocket
And I ain't gotta wrist watch that'll keep time
With a sick clock it's
Deja vu
Yesterday was like like this, honest
Seen rappers pass me by like freight trains
Is it my team or is it me that ain't got us playin' the same game
Truthfully it's probably neither
So I just try to keep my head down, feet on the ground, cooking up these heaters
But I must often play the peace keeper
For bitter dinosaurs that swore their time was grimier
But then got Ether'd
Sometimes my mind resets where it begun
As a kid I was sensitive, today I'm grown
And I feel so numb

[Hook]
This was supposed to be fun
'Cause we don't ever back down from challengers where I'm from
Wielding machete, hit the ready, Novocaine on my tongue
It's awful hard to feel any when you're basically numb
Come on
My sins are soulfully young
'Cause we don't ever grow bitter in the age that I'm from
Wielding machete, hit the ready, Novocaine on my tongue
It's awful hard to feel any when you're basically numb
Come on

[Bridge]
Basically numb
Come on
Basically numb
Come on
Basically numb
Come on
It's awful hard to feel any when your basically numb

[Verse 3]
See now the milk's gone
Honey dried up
We better be drinkin' the venom
To better the letters in my cup
Wise up
If you need me I'll be checked in
Thinkin' on that stocked bar
What's that room that Wrek's in?
Anywhere the shots are
Friends, fam, feelin' far away
I'm trying to bridge gaps
I know I don't make it easier by where I'm livin' at
Check up on me once awhile
I'ma do the same for you
I know that it's hard to smile especially when the pain is due
What's a fuckin' life if we don't make sure that we live it right
You can hear the doubts they shout and keepin' me up in the  night
I'ma shut 'em down for real
Fuck it, they don't hear me now
I've been chasin' mass appeal
But happy with my little crowd
If you hear me holla like your roof's on fire
Been tryna make a dolla and keep truth on wire
But it's so hard to keep it movin', layin' on a stretcher
So I'ma get to checkin' out and pressin' out the pressure
(Come on)

[Outro]
(Pressin' out the pressure)
(Come on)
It's awful hard to feel any when you're basically numb
(Come on)
