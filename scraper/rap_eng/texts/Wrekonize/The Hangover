[Hook: Wrekonize]
I've been trying to slow this life right down
But the memories fade so fast
I've been trying to sit and live with you
But the time we get never lasts
The memories are faded
(The memories are faded, memories are faded)
Can't remember who I am.. uh, uh, uh
No, No

[Verse 1: BernBiz]
I know it sounds cliche, but there ain't enough minutes in a day
Got friends that sayin' I changed, but I'm bringin' em' with growing pains
I tell em' that "Time Flies" and mine's it's own airlines
Been high for so damn long, can't find the landin' lights
This one's for the catalog, this one's for the Grandchildren
I hope they make a killin' from these mistakes we livin'
No time at all for chillin', feel Death is gettin' closer
They ask for "Party Shit", but this the hangover
Too much to hand over, too much to give away
Been workin' on this music but not my family
Take a moment to stand still, it's all still just a blur
One day, you're skippin' school, next day you're astro-turf
It's cool, it could be worse, that's why we don't rehearse
We like to walk the edge, to say we cheated Death
Until my last breath, I'm gonna put this world to the test
This one is for my friends and whoever's left

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
Everything sounds the same now, since I left that playground
And turned my toys directly in for processing and tape down
I figured you made rounds, you bailed out to a strange house
Grew up and left the place where we had met up and later became pals
Subtract some interest, add up the matter of difference
Divide us up by children and our separate styles of living
And it's quite clear, we are not the same human beings now
We lost a bunch of seasons while trying to find some even ground
Ha, this cannot be fair, I've been just trying to breath air, observing the world from my beach chair
You say, "we had dreams before", I'm tellin' you now I don't sleep much
You speakin' to me of regrets, I never have em', cause' feelin' so weak sucks
These 'L's are for the man in my reflection, who stands in my direction with an answer to my questions
So it seems all hope is on my see-saw, pouncin' off of me, fallin' into total recall
