LEGENDARY FREESTYLE

2-0

19 Get your face washed get your eyes clean
Reach up for the visine time to go to work for the ice cream
Low glows from the high beams
High ball with a nice lean
Said I’d go sober for another year
Pray for me that’s a dry dream
Got a minute on it and I’m thinking on it
That I’ll probably end up try to skip out on it
Sipping Gin and tonic sounding real exotic
Fuck I’m really honest devil pretty on it
I’mma need to go groove by
Back to a place I can dream in gold
My friends have been just getting too high
They tell me they don’t even dream no mo
Damn What kind of fucked off sick world we in
Buckshot on my burning skin
Two more drops I might hurl again
Downtown lemme park a scooter
Ditch that then call an uber
Still can’t decide to let him live or die
We’d be better off without a Parkland shooter
Revenge no retreat
I’mma Repent for your retweets
I’m a sinnerman o' war your beach sweet
Time to get em all a ride to beat street
I’m a penny wising rhyming in they mind I’m violent
Rising smiling I’m like Beep Beep
They need supervising who the fuck is driving
We are on this island sinking knee deep

Bout to re on up with the Snake and bat
Just as hungry now like who’s plate is that
I am not here to preach saving rap
At this point y'all can just come take it back

Got a side hustle in my pocket for the day I might drop it
And just i lok’it
Jimmy Snuka with a super fly rocket
Getting high off it pop an eye socket
Like Doug Quaid at Mars Dusk Trying to find a good bar trust
Hazed out Just trying to puff on the same dust as Elon Musk
Gimme space and room to breathe
Ron Artist with a doomed disease
To keep playing the game with some bruised knees
But I kick forever Bruce Lee
Tight work with the loose leaf
Mic burns when you proof read
Not born in the MIA but adopted by her like Soon yi
Trying to further my fams fame
Twin heirs with my last name
Bout to teach em how to get a fast lane
In a world that’s gotten pretty past lame
I’mma break it down and show em really how
I went a 1000 miles to rock a 1000 crowds
Got a 1000 styles I been spouting out
Till my vocals chords and my back’s sprained
So we push on up for the new year
New bars for a new gear
The goal is 52 here
1 down getting through clear
One shot twenty two beers
Thought you said you was going sober bruh
Well fuck man what do you care
Lemme take my sips in a day trip
To this 2019 Matrix
I been sitting pretty but I may shift
To some murda murda kill the hate quick
Bring a burner turn the learner page flip
Heard em say we earn a spurner wage split
But I’d rather be here to create shit
Than be a paid stiff in a oasis
