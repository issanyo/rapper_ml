[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
We've been rocking this shit for the different
Sick and psycho motherfucker's equivalent
People would normally knock, they all on a jock
But I'm asking for deliverance
We don't need any stroken, you hoping for chocking, voting
Take the bets and the beers
Cause everybody's reppin' a kin but you wasn't checking
Tech, messing with his
Rock and roll flow, lock and load boy
I've been busting without a concern
Stoppin' y'all, shoving off in your ho, I stood up then I shot in her perm
Got your lady hopping my wood cause everybody's talking my hood
Now you haters love us all the sudden when you be jeffin I just say I'm good

[Bridge]
We getting a whole lot of love for a while now
And the people who hated are super elated, ready to bow down
Now when I walk in the room all of the haters are dead sound
Now they probably all on my nuts, we won't be needing no head now

[Hook]
We don't need no head now
All those fuckers who didn't hear me
Let me all to say it again
We don't need no head now

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
You disliked me, now you like me
Cause you see that my jewelry's pricy
Never take it lightly when a brother write this
The music and message is mighty
Get up off my deal for real, you never knew I had the skill to kill
But now you know what I conceal is ill
Cause now the shit that I spill get mills
People hop on a band wagon, when you rocking in your damn habits
Back in the day wasn't no hand clapping
Now try to get to me, they ransacking shit
So get in my circle but fakers be hasty, yo
Get the fuck out of my face, I don't ever need your active fellatio

[Bridge]
We getting a whole lot of love for a while now
And the people who hated are super elated, ready to bow down
Now when I walk in the room all of the haters are dead sound
Now they probably all on my nuts, we won't be needing no head now

[Hook]
We don't need no head now
All those fuckers who didn't hear me
Let me all to say it again
We don't need no head now

[Verse 3: Wrekonize]
Never needed you hop on my Johnson
But you cannibalized all the nonsense
Now I got 'em all lined and ready to suck me dry with a bunch of Bianca's
Pedophiles off their knees cause them triggers'll spit, it's too late for the second portion
Petty crockers and mockers are gaveling cock until I'm a headless horseman

[Verse 4: Bernz]
Now you all smiles, I made it and y'all so proud
But bitch I done seen your true colors and now you can't hide 'em, you fucking piranha
Put this on my momma, I'll never be him
Second off for the latest of trends, getting lost in the whisky, you never were with me
Success is the sweetest revenge

[Bridge]
We getting a whole lot of love for a while now
And the people who hated are super elated, ready to bow down
Now when I walk in the room all of the haters are dead sound
Now they probably all on my nuts, we won't be needing no head now

[Hook]
We don't need no head now
All those fuckers who didn't hear me
Let me all to say it again
We don't need no head now
