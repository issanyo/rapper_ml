[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
Good-good-good evening to the commune
No need to stand, I promise y'all that I'll be gone soon
See I'm speakin' for the working folks
The cats who stay awake 'til dawn
Just tryin' to land upon the perfect note
The ones, who for the life of us —Åan't seem to keep it in
Or speak to a God, who isn't there to speak to them
They may not show it, but I'm sure that it's beneath the skin
Yeah that's the human being
We know it's fucked, but we pretend
I try to dream again, but I can't even sleep
And when I finally close my eyes
It's like a demon feeds my need to win
And so it keeps on, the saga, if you view my drift
The food is few, but we still overpopulate this moody bitch
Wait a minute 'til the seasons change
The scorching hot, the freezing rain
Everybody wanna flee the pain
But all can't end up leaving sane
So play games or maintain for the accolade
Either way, get away cause it's sad to say
Round here there'll be no man to save

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Do what I do with one foot in the grave
Smile up on my face like everything's okay
Everytime I leave I wonder if I should stay
Ay-ay, not today
Do what I do with one foot in the grave
Smile up on my face like everything's okay
Everytime I go I wonder if I should stay
Not today, one foot in the grave

[Verse 2: Bernz]
HEY! By the time you hear this I'll
Be long gone with a smile
So fuck you and your style
Get in these kicks and walk these miles
Don't hit no wall, life is a constant squall
Nuclear firearms, everytime I'm in those arms blast
When I raise my glass, toast my future, present, past
Inside I hope it last, at least 'til this hangover pass
Bombs over Baghdad, between have nots and must haves
Me on both sides, I keep tabs, in case it's over soon
Tick-tock, goes the box
Watch 'em go nuts and attempts to make it stop
But they can't, never learned to pick no locks
Watch, right from the sides, as they all suicide
As they all drink the Kool-Aid I observe and then drink mine

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
Do what I do with one foot in the grave
Smile up on my face like everything's okay
Everytime I go I wonder if I should stay (Sta-a-a-a-ay)
Not today, one foot in the grave
