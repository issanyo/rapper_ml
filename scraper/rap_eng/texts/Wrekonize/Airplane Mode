[Intro: Wrekonize]
Things ain’t going my way
I might as well float away
Things ain’t going my way
There’s nothing much else to say
But just..

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I’ll be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode

[Bridge: Bernz]
I’m so out of place, I’m so in my zone
I need an escape from here again
So give me some space and something to hold
I don’t want to play pretend again
So if I could just turn off the world I know that things will be alright
I just need to catch, I just need to catch my breath cause I’ll be in the sky tonight

[Verse 1: Bernz]
I’m all the way logged off
I’m sorry if I’m gone
I needed some space from all of the noise and all the distortion
I tried to find me a quiet place from all the misfortune
I’ll see you when I get back from getting my float on

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
I fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I’ll be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode

[Bridge: Wrekonize]
I’m so out of place, I’m so in my zone
I need an escape from here again
So give me some space and something to hold
I don’t want to play pretend again
So if I could just turn off this world around me, everything will be alright
I just need to catch my breath so if you need me, I’ll be in the sky tonight

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]
I’m under the bridge and in the clouds rolling around
Nobody is taking me down, I’m off the line now
So if you need me on the ground you’ll have to reach up to the stars
See I’m in airplane mode, I got no time to speak to y’all
I just...

[Hook: Wrekonize]
Fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
I fly high by myself
I just wanna be alone
Get high by myself
I put myself on airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I’ll be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I’ll be back before you know
Woah-oh-oh-oh
I put myself in airplane mode
