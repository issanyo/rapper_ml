[Intro]

Thank you ladies and gentlemen
You're a marvelous audience
Now get the hell outta here
That's it folks
I'd like to leave you with a little thought
To say this to you that
I feel terribly terribly and deeply sorry
For people who do not drink
Because when you get up in the morning
That's as good as you're gonna feel for the rest of the day

â€‹[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I got a few dollars in my pocket
But not enough if i wanna bottle for my rocket
Well what the fuck you mean
Got friends that depend on fucking lean
Cuz the world acts just too fucking mean
What you want what you want what you fucking need
This damn place is a base for a bunch of greed
I got bread for the butter head for the lover
What i gotta bring it to you so I get a show
I been living for the minute but im bout to need a gimmick
If I wanna keep my roof on though shit
My city pressed left to the flesh of fools
Bottom all round saying yes to julz
I need COD on the vegetables
Or they can get a fat mouth full of testicles
I got bitches
No i don't
I got visions
So i put em into flows
And i keep on seeing these things in the shadows
Walking with a heart full of arrows
Keeping eyes out on the sparrow
Somebody better come and find a wheel barrow
To carry this weight of mine
Decked out fresh in the 8 and 9
Superstar but i still wait in line
Cuz there ain't no stress worth me hating slime
NO C No G type of grind
JD 8 speed type of rhyme
Break fast quick like type of time
Wreks in here lemme twist your mind we just

[Verse 2: Wrekonize]

Well what the fuck brought y'all clowns in here
First class flight to the sound of cheers
Making records that bump for a thousand years
Gimme room to breathe you might soon believe
Hype shit blended with smoother me
Fans color in the dates like jujubees
I'm speeding way past a manuever speed
Catching up they not fast enough
But imma mash it up if they got tracks to cut
I get to bashing stuff whenever raps a must
Damn competition get to backing up
You made a grave mistake we all paid to race
And we don't really feel like letting you pass by
Even with a bit of that jack fire
Your whole plan might of just backfired
Gimme the tip of the scale filling the ale
They sent me to hell so that i could fail
But no one could tell my armor does well
Well my bloodline pumps for the glory bro
Enemies are pumping in the gloryhole
You a beast yeah wow great story bro
Your insides turn pale like an oreo
Walking round this little awkward town
And i could really use a boost in the market now
Somebody get me into something that's popping now
Fuck it i'll pull my big stock out and plow
NO C No G type of style
JD 8 speed type of loud
Break fast quick like time is now
Wreks in here lemme twist your brow we just vibing
