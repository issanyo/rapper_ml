[Intro]
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Neon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies

[Verse 1]
Shades triple black dark enough that they'd eclipse the sun
Got so many styles find it hard for me to stick to one
Competition murder them with one flick of this wicked tongue
Once you hear that rapid fire, now you know this shit's begun
In a Strangeland band with a mainland tan
Don't be acting like you never did see me
I'ma take that stand and debate that fan
Telling me how all the living is easy
What the fuck you thinking? I'm from the handle pan
Where you may come for peace and leave the beach as half a man
But it ain't just Florida, see it poppin' up in all the land
Some kind of new world order, I been looking for a god to damn
I've worked for years at this; made a million appearances
Got clearances all just to hear that girl say that's my fucking jam
And here I am the fucking son of Sam
Spit razorblades that's made of haze and taped to rubber bands
Now where the fuck I am, I'm yet to discover and
If I'm coming down tonight I'll just drop me another gram
They broke me down so I adopted me a rougher plan
Get rid of all those who been tripping our toes in a minute fold up them hands
Live vibes light it up amongst a sea of lies
Wake on the other side flying through them neon skies

[Hook]
This is that super ultrasonic phenom
Pitcher full of Jack, picture that with the beat on
Snake and bat on the map challenge that - be gone
Fuck with us, we high enough to skydive beyond
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She wants to know what we on
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Neon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Neon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies

[Verse 2]
Gimme that Jack D and a little cigarette full of something nexus
I'm Strange Music, mosh in pits and bouncers blocking exits
Before we signed the deal we flew to the Kansas City section
Where Tech and Trav confessed the fact our roster's lookin' reckless
To which I did agree and ordered us a fifth for three
Bartender morse code tatted that looks sick to me
I used to battle rap some years ago and matter of fact I'm glad
That that had critics unsuspecting what this kid could be
And here I am the fucking sick MC
Brit kid to the prick it seems and something slick this chick agrees
I'm in Miami where we all breathe at a different speed
I've heard of last call but it never did exist to me
Pour another shot, eyes dilated
I batter beef in bars and leave 'em feeling violated
I asked her how she feeling now, are we alive?
Us Skeptics even finding life inside them neon skies

[Hook]
This is that super ultrasonic phenom
Pitcher full of Jack, picture that with the beat on
Snake and bat on the map challenge that - be gone
Fuck with us, we high enough to skydive beyond
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She said she digs the neon (neon) lights
She wants to know what we on
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Neon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Black shades, neon skies
Neon-Ne-N-Ne- Neon skies
