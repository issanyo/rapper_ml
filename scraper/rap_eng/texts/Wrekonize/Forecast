[Verse]
I've got this feeling in my gut
But I don't even know just what's causing the pain
I've got my limps locked up in cuffs
But I don't even know just what's just wants to play
I think I feel the rain coming, rain coming
Rain coming, rain coming down
I think I feel the rain coming, rain coming
Rain coming, rain coming down
Oh-oh-oh-oh
