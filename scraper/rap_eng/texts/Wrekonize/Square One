[Verse 1:]
Check it out!
I kissed my mama goodbye
I told my baby so long
I told 'em "Don't wait for me that long, I don't know how long I'll be gone"
Maybe I wrote my whole life
Maybe I never get old
Never been in one place long enough to feel like I'm at home
And don't you see it lady, I've been tryin' to get with the flow
Tryin't to fit inside the system, and they calling it growth
I'm the last of those Mohicans holding down the fort
Trying to get a little peaking from the back of a Ford
Every time I get it figured out, I question it more
And I end up at the stuff again we've been at before
Yeah man, that's the ticket, that's the whole M-O
And this shit is just the cycle, trying to shine our spokes
All my folks saying

[Hook:]
I guess we're going back, back to square one
Yeah we going back, back to square one
I guess we going back, back to square one (Yeah! Back, back!)
Yeah we going back, back to square - one

[Verse 2:]
Hop in a time machine, go ahead and hit rewind
Till before I found my calling and I lost my mind
To before when all I had was nothin but time
And you could throw a five, and still shed a dime
My baby told me that she like the way I sound
To scared to turn it up, and now I play it loud
I blast it out the speakers 'till the neighbors' crowd
I think that she was right when I see them get down
But really I don't live in the past
I'm an amnesiac with tendencies to live too fast
The pictures and mementos slowing down my path
Either they killing my progression, or they hurt too bad
Yeah I regret
But it's cool, I stay in the present
But If I'm being real, I don't mind that I remembered
Lately there's some things that I've been forgettin'
I need to try and reconnect all my lost connections
Tell me where to look!

[Hook:]
I guess we're going back, back to square one
Yeah we going back, back to square one
I guess we going back, back to square one
Yeah we going back, back to square - one
Let's go!
