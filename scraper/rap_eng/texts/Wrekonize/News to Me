[Chorus: Wrekonize & Bernz]
Nothing they say is sounding new to me
I opted to play they start expecting no commercials
I thought you needed no rehearsal
But still you’re losing me
Nothing they say is sounding true to me
And often we play these fans expecting no reversals
I think they only made it worse though
But that ain’t news to me

[Verse 1: Wrekonize]
I’ve been around the globe talking like a marathon man
Innocence in my hand
Dishing it on command
Just a little lamb learning how to swim
Dog, paddle
You better start painting if you want to not dabble
In this world of water colours
Where so many of them suckers
Quick to paint a carbon copy and then claim that motherfucker
I’m just in the median
Feeling like a medium
Slaying every demon
On my way up to Elysium
Huh
I’ve got original flavour
But they ain’t been tasting that since we got into this wager
Original favour
With a digital nature
Oversaturated, when we all want to be major
The difference is
I’m damn proud of our differences
And cover up for no one I fear no witnesses
So come to hear the opening statement
I came to hear the future and I’m hopefully patient

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Bernz]
Nothing they say is sounding new to me
I opted to play they start expecting no commercials
I thought you needed no rehearsal
But still you’re losing me

[Verse 2: Bernz]
I see them try to catch the latest wave
But they started paddling to late
Sometimes it seems my radio is trying to lie to my face
It keeps manipulating me in such evil ways
And I don’t peep behind the curtain when I broke in the safe
And noticed it was rotten when they got on my plate
And I’ve been traveling through time cruising at 88
Now it’s looking like a purse so I’m pumping the breaks
And jumping for the reptiles trying to get through the gates
My pool is full of sharks circling they prey
So many ended in they belly while I’m still okay
So when they product place
I just lose my taste
They all food for waste
Ghouls in the tape
Another way to feed the beast that we tame
That I’ve been busy getting high so I feel no pain
So when I come back down it won’t feel the same
So I’ve got to say

[Chorus: Wrekonize & Bernz]
Nothing they say is sounding new to me
I opted to play they start expecting no commercials
I thought you needed no rehearsal
But still you’re losing me
Nothing they say is sounding true to me
And often we play these fans expecting no reversals
I think they only made it worse though
But that ain’t news to me

[Outro: Wrekonize & Bernz]
Nothing they say is sounding new to me
