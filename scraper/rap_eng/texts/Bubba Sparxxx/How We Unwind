[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of Bud Light
And a jug of moonshine if you're scared then run and hide
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of good times
And a jug of just fine this is how we unwind
Unwind

[Verse 1: D-Thrash]
Come and take a load off
This ain't work forget those thoughts
Lose that shirt and forget your boss
We out here in the dirt with hogs
Chillpn' out relaxed just spent the checks we cashed
Ain't got much but I have some friends
And family that got my back (that's right)
And we agreed to be true to our self our faith and beliefs
Livin' out here keepin' it simple yeah right underneath the trees
Want a cold beer grab one a little moonshine get you some
'Cause we ain't got nothin' else to do
But I did bring a few rounds to shoot, hah
Y'all go ahead but not me I'm gonna sit right here in my seat
I'm gon' lean back and kick my feet up and then I'll just repeat
This is how D-Thrash unwinds this is how I ease my mind
This is how I zone out and try to leave all the stress behind

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of Bud Light
And a jug of moonshine if you're scared then run and hide
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of good times
And a jug of just fine this is how we unwind
Unwind

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
All work no play me no way (no way)
Nope they never gon' say (never)
Ol' Bubba K just died one day
But never did live okay (okay)
Now that that's clear hand me a beer (Bud Light)
Yup tell her come here (come here)
Baby listen here we finna disappear
I ain't got but one gear (one gear)
Well maybe got two
One's stop and one's full speed (full speed)
Last of a dyin' real country boy breed
What I'm tryin' get girl whatcha gon' need (hey hey)
Hey you only live once
That's right lets make this night
The greatest celebration ever in this life
I'mma throw it out and she may just bite (woo)
That would be just fabulous
These boys around here hazardous
Like Bo and Luke tell the truth dude
This devi's got you mad at us
All we're doin' is layin' back
And turnin' up you hatin' that
That's a sad fact matter fact
We laugh at that what you think of that (hahaha)

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of Bud Light
And a jug of moonshine if you're scared then run and hide
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of good times
And a jug of just fine this is how we unwind
Unwind

From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of Bud Light
And a jug of moonshine if you're scared then run and hide
From when the moon flies until the sunrise
Baby we'll be goin' hard you don't get but one life
And we gon' live it up got a keg of good times
And a jug of just fine this is how we unwind
