[Verse 1]
That's what I'ma do, I made me a song
About my home, I've been gone for way to long
I belong to Georiga baby love that
It don't belong to me nobody run that
Not your governor (No) not your senator (No)
Not your congress person, they ain't real enough
Not for these folks they got their own set
Of principals they different individuals
Atlanta is still the shit but I really miss (what)
How it was prior to 1996 (damn)
When the Olympic gimmick turned the whole town
Upside down it made it a city though
We ain't really slow (Nah) we just layin' low
I let you play yourself then I take control (Yeah)
It's hard to summarize in just a couple lines
This place is fuckin' great, say it a hundred times

[Chorus]
We fly Delta and drink Coca-
Cola where I hang my hat
Sweet peaches with nice features
Yo I'm going home to Georgia
Ray Charles, Allen Jackson
The god father, baby how you feel about that
Big city but not really
Yeah, I'm going home to Georgia
Wo-wo wo-wo yo
I'm going home to Georgia
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah
I'm going home to Georgia

[Verse 2]
I'm talking Ray Cross
I'm talking West Point
I'm talking East Point
And that is the point
If I'm south of Tennessee I'm at home
If you use to 'Bama baby this your song
I love the whole south, I love the whole world
But no girl loves me like ol' girl
Down in Le Grange, I can't change up
Not on her 'cause she would tear this thing up
I'm talking Albany
I'm talking Athens
I'm talking Brunswick
Yeah bitch what's happenin'
I like it I love it I'm so proud of it
It'd take the National Guard to get me out of it
Georgia

[Chorus]
We fly Delta and drink Coca-
Cola where I hang my hat
Sweet peaches with nice features
Yo I'm going home to Georgia
Ray Charles, Allen Jackson
The god father, baby how you feel about that
Big city but not really
Yeah, I'm going home to Georgia
Wo-wo wo-wo yo
I'm going home to Georgia
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah
I'm going home to Georgia

[Chorus]
We fly Delta and drink Coca-
Cola where I hang my hat
Sweet peaches with nice features
Yo I'm going home to Georgia
Ray Charles, Allen Jackson
The god father, baby how you feel about that
Big city but not really
Yeah, I'm going home to Georgia
Wo-wo wo-wo yo
I'm going home to Georgia
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah
I'm going home to Georgia

I'm going home to Georgia
I'm going home to Georgia
I'm going home to Georgia
