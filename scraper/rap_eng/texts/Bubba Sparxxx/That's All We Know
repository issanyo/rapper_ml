[Chorus: D Thrash]
Kick back in the saddle with some Hank turned up
Got the pedal to the floor 12 gauge in the truck
With the Bible on the console that’s how these boys role
We take it slow in this simple life is all we know
(Simple life is all we know, simple life is all we know)
(Yeahhhh) that’s all we know
(That's all we know)
(That's all we know)
(Yeahhhh) Yeah come on
(That's all we know)

[Verse 1: Dez]
Y'all know how we ride down south
Throwing dust in the air
Yeah buddy that’s automatic
Swerve to the left and the right
Sitting back in the saddle
And you know we driving so erratic
Yeah
So the clock hits high noon
Roll around while I listen to my iTunes
Doin’ donuts spinning like a typhoon
Man this country livin' always puts me in the right mood
In the backwoods feeling like a million bucks
Talkin' 'bout on a daily basis
Hard day at work but I’m finally headed home
Sorta like I done when I round the bases
Yeah I see ya faces
Riding through this oasis
Cock back and we let it fly in the air
Goin through them shotgun shells by the cases
Hey is that dat Dez individual in general animal this lyrical chemical
Spittin' with the interval, this is minimal, in dependable
Got me stuck up in the middle while the world is pitiful
I'mma try to talk a little bit of sense in to em’
Ain’t  sure though that it’s gonna work
Till then I'mma keep it backwoods
Hold my ground
Keep my boots dug down in the dirt

[Chorus: D Thrash]
Kick back in the saddle with some Hank turned up
Got the pedal to the floor 12 gauge in the truck
With the Bible on the console that’s how these boys role
We take it slow in this simple life is all we know
(Simple life is all we know, simple life is all we know)
(Yeahhhh) that’s all we know
(That's all we know)
(That's all we know)
(Yeahhhh) Yeah come on
(That's all we know)

[Verse 2: Dez]
Down by the creek we livin' that good life
By now everybody feeling right
I know it’s going to be a good night
What a sight
Got a 100 folks chilling out til’ the daylight
Little bit of the heaven on earth
Yeah man so we in the clouds
Been at it for a little minute now
And we ain’t about to quit no we can’t stop now
We just getting goin', gas tank full 'bout to spill over
Fish tailin on the back dirty road
With the four wheel drive hoppin all kinda boulders
Kick back with the music turned up
I don’t know how to do it any other way
Got a shot gun ridin shotgun
In the rig son if you want to get in let’s play
What cha’ll wanna do
Maybe throw a few back in the boons
Open the doors and crank the radio son
Got the Jawga Boyz on and we let it boom
You don’t even know how we do it down here
‘Less ya like us man and you from the woods
Bible in the middle of the console
With the windows rolled down and we feelin good

[Chorus: D Thrash]
Kick back in the saddle with some Hank turned up
Got the pedal to the floor 12 gauge in the truck
With the Bible on the console that’s how these boys role
We take it slow in this simple life is all we know
(Simple life is all we know, simple life is all we know)
(Yeahhhh) that’s all we know
(That's all we know)
(That's all we know)
(Yeahhhh) man what up boy
(That's all we know)

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparkxxx]
We gon’ turn up til the lights get turned on
Drinking homemade liquor no Smirnoff (Smirnoff)
Riding with a 12 gauge and my bird bog (bird dog)
They hatin' on me am I concerned nah (naw)
See daddy always told me I would know whenna’ (whenna')
Was really doin it right is when folks getta’ (getta')
Taste inside of they mouth that is so bitta’ (bitta')
Spit it out and it’s spellin out cho’ letters
As in B-U-B-B-A A-I-N-T S-H-I-T
I say that’s O K by me
Cause see Bubba he pray nightly (nightly)
And I know G O D got me
So I ain’t stressin nobody (nobody)
I’ll achieve my goals watch me
That T-A-L-K won’t stop me (no no)
I’m just tyin to lay back in a Duramax (Duramax)
With a cold 12 pack, I'mma murder that
What’s ridin down low I never heard of that (what)
We sittin way up in the sky where the birdies at (birdie)
Me and D-E-Z got the Hank cranked (cranked)
So loud that a hillbilly can’t think
But I don’t want to think
I just wanna drank
Cold Bud Light til’ the point I’m feelin no pain (no more)

[Chorus: D Thrash]
Kick back in the saddle with some Hank turned up
Got the pedal to the floor 12 gauge in the truck
With the Bible on the console that’s how these boys role
We take it slow in this simple life is all we know
(Simple life is all we know, simple life is all we know)
(Yeahhhh) that’s all we know
(That's all we know)
