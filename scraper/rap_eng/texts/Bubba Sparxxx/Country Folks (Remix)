[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Country fried tongue tied them haters
Bubba K's back french fry them taters
The truck sits high but the nuts swing slow
And I'm huntin' me a muddy hole (come on)
Dirty my cubicles it's just business as usual
To y'all it's unsuitable but to us it's beautiful
Fill up the cooler and lets maneuver through Trap County
The sheriffs my buddy so we ain't worried about that mountie (no sir)
Just ask 'bout me my reputation
Is that of a good dude that really was raised in
This here location, it really did make it
Then planted the seed for a whole generation
Yeah I'm pretty good but God is great (great)
Keep him in my heart and I'll be straight (straight)
Without him in my home I'd go crazy
Ain't nothin' like my folks baby

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk
My country folk

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
See me an Bubba, we been doin' this a long while
It sure seems a lot longer than a country mile
Hollywood look good, full of fake friends
I never thought we could ever be here again (we back)
Time heals, one fell, one came up
Back together son, we gon' tear this thing up
A lot of talkers, I ain't gotta name em’
They wanna be us, hell I can’t blame em’
So looky here, cold beer on a tailgate
Been doing this for some years, ya'll so late
Bangin' OutKast and a little George Strait
Hot damn, Colt Ford back with Bubba K

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk
My country folk

[Verse 3: [?]]
Country folk little smoke lotta beer
Pardon me I'm a Tennessee Volunteer (what's up)
Pour it up raise your drinks up high
Gotta a case of Bud Light and a jar of Apple Pie (hey)
Before we're done you can bet the sun comes up
Or the cops come then everyone runs
Work all week party on the weekends
Spend Sunday's fishin' drinkin'
Watchin' NASCAR live on the TV
Fried catfish coleslaw sweat tea
Big guns but only if we need 'em
Gods family freedom that's it

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk
My country folk

[Verse 4: [?]]
Backwoods by the river in the sunshine
Not a worry on my mind tryin' wet a line
That's how we do it in the south baby all day
Work hard in the yard then we go play
Come home ta mama cookin' in the kitchen
Daddy's in his chair little whiskey sippin'
Tea's on ice fresh fried chicken
I'm loveing my life this here's livin'
Yeah a man's word is his handshake
And the southern slang you can't translate
Everything's good we ain't on the ropes
Let me hear it one time for my country folk

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk
My country folk
