Back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, "naw boy, this music a'int yours"
That's when me and fat Steve got that handle of beam
Drank that motherfuckin' dry, started chasin' these dreams
Then a tram pulled up bumpin' Player's Ball
We soaked up the game, fish grits and all
And now look what the south done let up out they mouth
Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

Buckle up, look daddy, cause Bubba K come to play
All these crackers livin' good, that ain't what my stomach say
Every slut at U-G-A who daddy pay they way
Wanted me to stay and play, well Betty gotta pay to lay
I really hate to say you can't elevate to this
But if I settle for your level I ain't never makin' hits
Me and Bobby tight as shit on the demo, fore we send it
And I'm tryna fuck these tits on this bimbo fore I end it
See I'm off balance, and I just bought a half a gallon
Of Jim Beam cause it seems to cultivate this talent
That I got in my hot, why don't you ask the slums
Or them folks who get they crumbs using microphones and drums
Or go to where I'm from, in LaGrange for a change
But be careful, it gets muddy, get a stain on your Range
The shame made you change, you could look me eye to eye
Cause Bubba got that fire, tell the truth, you like it, aye

Back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand "naw boy this music a'int yours"
That's when me and fat Steve got that handle of beam
Drank that motherfuckin' dry, started chasin' these dreams
Then a tram pulled up bumpin' Player's Ball
We soaked up the game, fish grits and all
And now look what the south done let up out they mouth
Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

I'm touchin' down off the loot, with Jen and a group
Of jazzy little females to buy, cut and resell
Oh we hell, like prerogatory gone sour
And it's got me eating Xannies every hour on the hour
I'm pissin' in the shower cause my toilet's overflowin'
Then I hit ghetto Chris, I know he got that dojah blowin'
Look my toes is showin' through these four year old Brooks
Bubba actin' shady, got my ex old lady shook
She know that I'm a crook by the chances that I took
So it's normal buyin' Polo's to enhance the way I look
But I won't close the book cause this stress killed us both
Then meet me at the Grammys with the scissors and the roach
I'm slizzered on the porch like Sean Paul and J-Bo
My Bloodz far from3 Young though, I'm using drugs to halo
Ain't no way in hell I'm a fail now
Where's some Colli ? buddy could you put this bail out

Back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, "naw that music a'int yours"
That's when me and fat Steve got that handle of beam
Drank that motherfuckin' dry, started chasin' these dreams
Then a tram pulled up bumpin' Player's Ball
We soaked up the game, fish grits and all
And now look what the south done let up out they mouth
Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

You see I can't sang a lick but I rap till I'm outta spit
And I heard your girl remark how Bubba is hot as shit
So now I got the hit but make no mistake, I break
As soon as she make me shake, just in time for y'all day to day
I break the top 8 at 8 if I'm longer than Mr. Black
Scott Weaver had a half of home grown, and we twistin' that
Now Athens up on the map, you could hate me or give me dap
But I was a part of that, drankin' miller straight out the tap
And I'm strapped with thirty beans and a sheet of that jelly-jelly
With them Rucker boys and Paco pushin' the heavy chevy
Lookin' for Betty-Betty's just talkin' bout cutty-cutty
Bring your sister, your niece and especially your slutty buddy
And Bubba a lovey-dovey wit y'all two at a time
Fuck these lames in this game, seeming too mad to shine
Man, be glad you rhyme, ? and we stay good
And when Bubba's holdin' fort, make sure you listen good

Back in the day he was outta control
Need another standoff but his music ate y'all
That's when me and fat Steve got that handle of beam
Drank that motherfuckin' drive, started chasin' these dreams
Then a tram pulled up bumpin' Player's Ball
We soaked up the game, fish grits and all
And now look what the south done let up out they mouth
Country ass, Bubba Sparxxx, and I ain't fin to cut it out

I wanted all y'all hatin' motherfuckers
To put this bitch in ya tapedeck
Let it bump for a minute, let it marinate
Take it backwards, how you love that
I ain't yours no more sir, no more
Like that
