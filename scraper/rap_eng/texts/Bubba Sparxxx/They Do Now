[Chorus]
Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now

Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now now

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Lookey here lookey here Jawga Boyz against Bubba's here
We involved a couple beers and concocted what you hear
I took off a couple years and like that I just appeared
Better yet reappear now let me make something clear
These boys ain't nothing near me they just gettin' by
I'm beastin' 365 Chevrolet sittin' high (high high)
Smoke in the sky stacked like them Lac boys
Salutations to those makin' that country rap noise (hey)
Hey I still remember in '96 talkin' to Colt Ford
'Bout makin' it out in the sticks
Figured out how to mix what they said couldn't be
(Why would they do that)
I'm thinkin' why wouldn't he (why not)
And it's beautiful to see it turn into we (we)
They told me to turn it down they turn it up eventually
Now we got the backwoods jumpin' ain't it somethin'
They didn't like it but over time we made 'em love it

[Chorus]
Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now

Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now now

[Verse 2: D-Thrash]
Everyday there's somebody hatin' (ha)
A hundred million hits radio won't play it (man)
How much longer will they try to deny (huh)
Kids all across the world screamin' ridin' high man (haha)
I remember when they told me don't try it (nope)
Laughed in my face said that nobody would buy it (hah)
But now we stay in Hyatt's moved on from the Super 8
Went from pinchin' pennies to eatin' off a full plate (woo)
Grew up yellin' Bubba K all day (yes)
Skippin' class writin' rhymes in the hallways (yes)
Now we both on the track like a cross fade (yes)
Jawga Sparxxx cuttin' records like a saw blade

[Chorus]
Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now

Country boy country boy turn that shit down
You know these people out here don't wanna hear the sound
Of Bubba K and Jawga Boyz tearin' it down
They may not have then but I bet they do now now
