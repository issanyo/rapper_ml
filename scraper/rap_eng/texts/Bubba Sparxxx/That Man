[Hook - Sleepy Brown]
Everywhere that I seem to go, all people they know
There goes that man
Cadillac's steady move, all ladies choose it
There goes that man
Been all around the world and I kissed every girl
There goes that man
Girl this ain't no kind of allusion, it's really that man
There goes that man

[Verse 1 - Duddy Ken]
Hey, when we step up out the play man
We bring that monster A game
Switchin or say through lanes
Green on my shirt like Tulane
Drunk and drivin in two lanes
Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'mma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for "Deliverance"
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with "Me, Myself, and I" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
Country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
Of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them
Bubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me
Ask your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately
Fucker (*echo*)
