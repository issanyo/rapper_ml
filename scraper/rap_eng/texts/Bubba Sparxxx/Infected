Hahahahahahah! Don't be scared of me
Come on over here and let Bubba infect you
Uhh, uhh

From the slums the East of Athens to the plains in North LaGrange
Bubba K can stumble drunk up on any porch I hang
Smokin all sources dank - from Jimmy Shwagger to Cambud
And I'm chasin Jim Beam, we keep stallin until my time's up
Line up lames it's time for your vaccination
Be glad you been infected, accept it, congratulations
I got platinum asperations but fear's my motivation
I'mma wait in my time to shine but daily I grow impatient
Strictly for procreation, I need to plant my seeds
Since these bitches won't cut I'll rely on my hand to breathe
Fuckin this Cantonese, Betty named Tamberly
And her four older sisters 'til the blisters began to bleed
They probably'll banish me for spittin in how I'm live it
But I'm still with my tongue out - flickin it like a lizard
Bubba like chicken gizzards; fried in Southern pride
Man go on and drink dat beer but you know I'mma funnel mine

[Hook: Bubba Sparxxx]
Now you could shoot it in yo' veins or shoot it up straight to yo' brain
You could smoke it out a bowl or get a blunt and roll it swole
Lo and behold boy you should've done injected
Cause if you ride with me I'mma get you so infected
Now you could hit that Betty raw or bust a load off in her jaw
You could place it where she doo doo, or even lick her poo doo
See I don't care what you do, just don't leave her neglected
Cause if you fall asleep I'mma get her so infected!

I just got off the phone with God, he said - I know this might seem odd
But Bubba I really need you, these preachers ain't doin they job
So travel to Cape Cod, buy a thousand sheets of acid
And distribute it witcho' album, no doubt that'll be a classic
Dude lockin up every fashion, whether it's dope from weed to coke
From heroin to X, so next we needin a boat
Off the coast of eastern Georgia for two hundred keys of snort
For them heavy reefer chiefers, the five was trees to blow
They count on me fo' sho', if you fronted I'm goin the low
Man I'm from who did it though, but it's funny, cause no one sold it
But now that Bubba hold it I'm certain they gon' disperse it
The rural parts the suburbs, I know that may seem absurd
But long ago when I heard they meet the urban people
They play by ears for years now my folks deserve some equal
Affection from this infection that gives our foundation
The same blood the same drugs equals a proud nation

Shit I probably know what you thankin when yo' legs get wobbly drankin
(Bubba K got it hard!) That's when they found yo' body stankin
And you won't be body linkin, what you thought I was from N'Sync?
I'm a country muh'fucker who ain't changed my clothes in six weeks
Runnin with a thick fleet, of hungry Caucasoids
The type when you see us in the club actin up y'all avoid
Call your boys I got boys from Westpoint to Nelly B
Yeah I run with black folks too and they do carry heat
Plus I fuck with smelly freaks and I think they pussy very sweet
The fine Betty Betty with double D's and sexy feet
On coke or ecstasy, down here we call 'em Beanie Babies
She was sensitive to the touch so when we fuck I mean it's gravy
But I ain't seen her lately - I been too busy chasin patients
We gon' shoot a movie next just so yo' ass can play the hatin
If the livest in yo' faction tellin me where the mic's at
He won't never rap again and he might not ever get his pride back

[Hook] - 2X

Exactly like that
Now we all infected..
Now yo' life's the same as mine
And my life's the same as yours
We all standin in the same, same shit..
I thank God and Khalifani
Anybody else got infected, or willin to be infected
Nonsense.. Bubba Sparxxx
