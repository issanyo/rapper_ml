[Intro]
Woo come on

[Verse 1: Charlie Farley]
Gimme them there buck shot, buck shot
And I take 'em to that there back road
Gimme them there loud pipes, loud pipes
And I'll rack 'em 'til your ear explode
Gimme them there nevermind, nevermind
It don't matter what you give me
'Cause anything I got is four-wheel drive
Hi, I'm a redneck I keep mine

[Chorus: Charlie Farley]
Jacked up, old truck, new tires, and I keep it
Jacked up, Solo cup, with the Crown and I'm stayin'
Jacked up, music up, windows down, so I keep it
Jacked up, and if you're talkin' bad about the country
You gonna get it jacked up

[Verse 2: Charlie Farley]
I get it then kick it in four-wheel drive (yeah)
Spinnin' them tires with the grip and slingin' mud a mile high (yeah)
If you're wonderin' where am I, I am on that mile wide
Track route, whipped out, slip n slidin'
Mack tires, get down deep, they divin'
Extra baloney, ride with the fish homey
Honest on this ride first
Run tadpoles jump out like I don't want it
Mud on it, boggin', even if I was lonely
The only thing is, I ain't my friends
I'm callin' 'em 'til the morning

[Chorus: Charlie Farley]
Jacked up, old truck, new tires, and I keep it
Jacked up, Solo cup, with the Crown and I'm stayin'
Jacked up, music up, windows down, so I keep it
Jacked up, and if you're talkin' bad about the country
You gonna get it jacked up

[Verse 3: Charlie Farley]
You're ridin' low, you won't make it through the hole (nope)
Take mini me and go (go), fill it up with creatine
It'll grow up and you can bring it out again play with me, 33's
It ain't true what women say about the feet (down here)
Everything big from SUV's to ATV's boy (down here)
Everything we sip comes with a kick so we're makin' noise (round here)
Matter of fact if it ain't got that then you can't come (round here)
Yeah, that's why I thoroughly enjoy

[Chorus: Charlie Farley]
Jacked up, old truck, new tires, and I keep it
Jacked up, Solo cup, with the Crown and I'm stayin'
Jacked up, music up, windows down, so I keep it
Jacked up, and if you're talkin' bad about the country
You gonna get it jacked up

[Verse 4: Charlie Farley]
Catch me rippin', roarin', rollin' like I lost it (yes sir)
'Til the mornin' knowin' I'm out from exhaustion (yes sir)
Feelin' forty from forty creek and a mosh pit (yes sir)
In the mud pit (yeah) and I'm lovin' in (yeah)
Gotta get back into it, do it again sip some more fluid
Movin' alcohol is what's movin'
Me I'm at the follow, I'm groovin', groovin'
As a mud digger video (ooh yeah)
Put me in the truck lets go do it, do it
Ooh yeah, you know we keep 'em

[Chorus: Charlie Farley]
Jacked up, old truck, new tires, and I keep it
Jacked up, Solo cup, with the Crown and I'm stayin'
Jacked up, music up, windows down, so I keep it
Jacked up, and if you're talkin' bad about the country
You gonna get it

[Verse 5: Colt Ford & Bubba Sparxxx, Both]
If I'm ridin' it in I'm gon' jack it on up
If your girl with me she gon' back it on up
On an old dirt road cold beer in an Igloo
A deep wet hole is what I'm gettin' into
Don't worry 'bout him honey he's not jacked up
Sittin' so high you can swing from my truck nuts
Somebody said my truck nuts stuck what
That'll never happen baby girl no uh uh
Let me drop it in low get down and dirty
Pipes so loud I know you heard me
Six foot high up there with the birdies
Ridin' so dirty woo ain't it pretty
Everybody 'round here we gon' keep 'em jacked up
If you ridin' like that baby throw your hands up
Lets ride ah ah ah lets ride

[Outro: Charlie Farley]
Jacked up
Jacked up
Jacked up
