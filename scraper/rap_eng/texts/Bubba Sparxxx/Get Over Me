[Outro]
Hey
This song is for anybody that's got regrets
Get over it

[Verse 1]
I remember it all too well
Everything and an all too hell
Her love her patience
Her tolerance she had a lot of it
She had a lot to give and I took it
'Till I didn't want it no more then I booked it
I wonder if I had took a right
When I hooked that left what would life be like

[Chorus]
There I go again
Here I go with that bullshit
Thinking about everything that could have been
Coulda woulda shoulda
Instead of the places I still could go
Watcha gonna do today
And we just wasted time like I had it to blow
You know what fuck that shit
It's time to start livin' instead of just waiting to die
I said it's time to start laughin' instead of just waiting to cry
And it's time for me to get over me
It's time for me to get over me
Yeah it's time for me to get over me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm most alone when I'm in my past
Still I drift let right now pass
Instead of just learning from it I let it dwell
It's my prison it's my hell
Sure I could have done a lot of shit differently
I got a note and it just wasn't meant for me
My energy is worth more
This day will have no encore

[Chorus]
There I go again
Here I go with that bullshit
Thinking about everything that could have been
Coulda woulda shoulda
Instead of the places I still could go
Watcha gonna do today
And we just wasted time like I had it to blow
You know what fuck that shit
It's time to start livin' instead of just waiting to die
I said it's time to start laughin' instead of just waiting to cry
And it's time for me to get over me
It's time for me to get over me
Yeah it's time for me to get over me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
If I can just get me out of the way
There's probably nothin' I can't do
If I can just learn how to love me
I just might ca-stand you
I think about you and Jo Jo
Sitting in that cell on slow mo
I got to go I got to do it for them
I got to do it for me I got to do it again

[Chorus]
There I go again
Here I go with that bullshit
Thinking about everything that could have been
Coulda woulda shoulda
Instead of the places I still could go
Watcha gonna do today
And we just wasted time like I had it to blow
You know what fuck that shit
It's time to start livin' instead of just waiting to die
I said it's time to start laughin' instead of just waiting to cry
And it's time for me to get over me
It's time for me to get over me
Yeah it's time for me to get over me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
