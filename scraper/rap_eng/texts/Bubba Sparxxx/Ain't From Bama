[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Me and D-Thrash off in the Chevy we mash
Put my foot on the gas and say bye-bye to the past (Georgia)
We Georgia Bulldogs but we roll like the tide
And my paint job is black got camo on the inside
Just country boy coolin' with a cooler full of beverages
They talked about me badly but never was I stressing it
Just keep it at a distance don’t bring to my residence (don't do it)
Or we gon’ be in court dog tryna reach a settlement
After I whopp that ass (that ass)
So let us not walk that path (that path)
Just have yourself a cold one
And try to get up on one of these girls is all I ask (I ask)
It’s the country rap royalty also known as Bubba K
Leave your car at home cause we playin’ with the trucks today
We got a stripper pole in the mud hole
Go Betty go, roll tide roll

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

[Verse 2: D Thrash]
The mud hole about to spill over (woo)
So many trucks getting dirty and we takin' over (haha)
Something like a redneck mafia (hah)
Haters keep talkin' but they ain’t stopping us (uh uh)
We keep droppin' bucks (hah) and doin' what we do (ooh)
Livin' out here with a different attitude (yeah)
Just tryna be free (hah) don’t want to be bothered (uh)
Workin' real hard (yeah) they call it blue collar (huh)
Rollin on the mud grips that you can hear (yeah)
Make our own whiskey from a moonshine still (uh)
We like to make deals that we call under the table (that's right)
Duck and dodge Uncle Sam if we’re able (hah)
We don’t get cable out in the sticks
Only option is to have a satellite dish
But I’m never really home to watch much of it (no)
'Cause I’ll be in my truck pullin' cars out the ditch
With a winch (haha)

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

[Verse 3: Dez]
We keep on flowin' and rollin'
Just like the tide comin' in
Then (okay) stompin' down the Duramax again
That’s my country Benz (woo)
Kin in the back actin’ like they on a roller coaster (yes sir)
Not sure I’m riding legal (naw) even though I’m supposed to
Now they mention Dez (uh) hearin' em’ say I’m bumpin' him (yes sir)
That’s that boy that’s on the songs now I’m bubbin' them (ain't it)
Just some Jawga Boyz getting it while the gettin’s good
Stereo knockin' out the back while we splittin' wood
We living good, slip slide on these muddy roads (muddy roads)
Just the way of life for these wild southern folks (southern folks)
On another note we just hanging out and feelin' right (feelin' right)
Got the tailgate parallel to the ground tonight (ahh)
Feet dangling, banging the hank and sangin'
Little bit jealous how we hangin'
Really can’t say that I want to be blamin' them (naw)
Aimin’ the Smith and Wesson’s to the clouds
Feel the kick back (kick back)
And while they talkin' we rollin' believe we livin' that

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)

Fifty cases and they on ice (on ice)
Got a black Duramax and it’s so tight (so tight)
We ain’t from Bama but we roll like, the tide
Slip n Slide and we feelin' right (feelin' right)
