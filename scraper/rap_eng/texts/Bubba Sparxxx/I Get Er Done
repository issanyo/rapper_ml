[Chorus: Cash Clip]
She said she wanna party (hey), I'm the man around here (here)
Yeah, she said she wanna ride me, ride me my like my John Deere
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here
I got my truck up in the air (air), and a case of Belvedere (here)
And an empty water bottle (hey) just to spit my grizzly beer (beer)
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here (Cash Clip Jawga Boyz come on)

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah so we we get 'er done long as she's over 21
And the backwoods is where she's from, a little mud don't scare her none (yeh yeh)
Yeah we runnin' brand new trucks all through that mess stuff
(What's the point of that?) Sit your ass down let me tell you bro
The point of fact the point of that is just how we do it
My Duramax I hit the gas and it just power through it
You disrespect I whoop your ass it ain't no cower to it (no)
You was confused I gave it you and now you knew it (come on)
Jawga Boyz, Cash Clip, I'm with that shit (that shit)
A can of dip plus some shine equals a classic (classic)
Bubba K is a legend and legend has it (has it)
That we been got 'er done comin' from up out in Athens

[Chorus: Cash Clip]
She said she wanna party (hey), I'm the man around here (here)
Yeah, she said she wanna ride me, ride me my like my John Deere
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here
I got my truck up in the air (air), and a case of Belvedere (here)
And an empty water bottle (hey) just to spit my grizzly beer (beer)
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here

[Verse 2: Cash Clip]
She said I'm country boy, you want me boy I get 'er done
Gotta chick that really likes hicks and I think that chick tryna get her tongue
Bubba Sparxxx and Jawga Boyz in the whip and the whip gonna come
Little bit of this, little bit of that, and I might just bang like a real big gun
That country girl swag such a miraculous teaser
She got me hot up in these woods, she give me cabin fever
I'm 'bout to have that body shakin' like she having seizures
She said you ready come and get it like I'm Justin Bieber
I popped the wintergreen dip then all of a sudden
She jumped and got her brothers keys and said we goin' muddin'
She got me takin' Jager bombs up out her belly button
I need that country lovin' now you can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Cash Clip]
She said she wanna party (hey), I'm the man around here (here)
Yeah, she said she wanna ride me, ride me my like my John Deere
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here
I got my truck up in the air (air), and a case of Belvedere (here)
And an empty water bottle (hey) just to spit my grizzly beer (beer)
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here

[Verse 3: Young Gunner & D. Thrash]
When it comes to work or it comes to play
I get 'er done like every day
When it comes around to these wine dines
I flip 'em over like every way
When it comes around to these dirt roads
I'm full blast up on the gas
When it comes around to this weekend
I'm drinkin' beer and I'm kickin' ass
What up Cash, what up Thrash, Bubba K's up on the track
Turned up straight to the max
We country boys, we pen and packs
These haters mad 'cause we hardly work
Got 'em walkin' off and they kickin' dirt
These haters mad 'cause we hardly work (yeah)
Got 'em walkin' off (yeah) and they kickin' dirt (yeah)
Jawga Boyz, Bubba Sparxx and Cash Clip
Gettin' 'er done with a lip full of dip
We moonshine sippin' these city folks trippin'
Sayin' we shouldn't rap, we just talkin' how we livin'
Haha

[Chorus: Cash Clip]
She said she wanna party (hey), I'm the man around here (here)
Yeah, she said she wanna ride me, ride me my like my John Deere
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here
I got my truck up in the air (air), and a case of Belvedere (here)
And an empty water bottle (hey) just to spit my grizzly beer (beer)
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get 'er done around here
I get 'er done (I get 'er done), I get' er done around here (hey)
