[Chorus]
I remember how I wanted to trade
The dirt and the gravel for a road that was paved
I told my daddy when I leave I ain't comin' back
He just smiled said "hush child enough of that"
I took off and I circled the globe
Did a whole lot of livin' and I want him to know
I miss that ol' rooster crowin' when the sun rise (he's right boss)
'Cause that's my life that's my life

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I love my mama and I love my daddy
But I wanna live life and I'm feelin' like I'm ready (ready)
Leave this farm see the world and all its charm (charm)
It's a big old scary place but it can not cause me harm (nope)
Long as I walk with God (God) and remember Andy Mathis is
Not no Billy Madison act like you have some sense (hahaha)
Sounded good in theory when it's time to practice it
That common sense was absent it really was some tragic shit
Then I headed back home with my tail tucked
No more Time Square now I'm pickin' square bales up (woo)
And I couldn't possibly be more appreciative (nope)
This is my life this is how I need to live, yes sir

[Chorus]
I remember how I wanted to trade
The dirt and the gravel for a road that was paved
I told my daddy when I leave I ain't comin' back
He just smiled said "hush child enough of that"
I took off and I circled the globe
Did a whole lot of livin' and I want him to know
I miss that ol' rooster crowin' when the sun rise
'Cause that's my life that's my life

[Verse 2: D-Thrash]
I found myself makin' music in the big city (hah)
With big names and fame was movin' in quickly
Nothin' was gonna stop me from my rise
But inside I knew my soul might die
'Cause in my eyes I didn't see pride
I felt like everything was a lie
And I knew if I stayed out here
I would no longer have a firm grip on the steerin' wheel
I'll be in the backseat along for the ride
Gave it a try but that's just not my life
Went back to the country to be with my honey
And like me everybody talks funny

[Chorus]
I remember how I wanted to trade
The dirt and the gravel for a road that was paved
I told my daddy when I leave I ain't comin' back
He just smiled said "hush child enough of that"
I took off and I circled the globe
Did a whole lot of livin' and I want him to know
I miss that ol' rooster crowin' when the sun rise
'Cause that's my life that's my life
