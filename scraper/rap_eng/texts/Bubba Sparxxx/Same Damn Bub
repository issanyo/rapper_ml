It's the same damn Bub
It's the same damn same damn Bub
It's the same damn Bub
It's the same damn it's same damn

[Verse]
It's the same damn Bub
Man who the hell you think that was
Same one you hated on but he gave back love
Yeah use you for a minute then trade back up (trade back up)
It's the same damn Bub
Tryin' bum a little change back up
Went in way past deep no I came back up
Pour a little Tittos in it I'll drink that cup (I'll drink that up)
It's the same damn Bub
Every now and then you may slack up
When I'm on my shit though they can't match up
And I'ma have to call the ol' haystack up (haystack up)
It's the same damn Bub
Y'all talkin' whatcha think that does
Loud enough to make a sleepin' giant wake back up
Talk 'bout me so much man ain't that love (I think that's love)
It's the same damn Bub
Man what color you gon' paint that truck
'88 Silverado that I may jack up
Now I'm just tryin' get it cranked back up (crank back up)
It's the same damn Bub
I ain't comin' to your lame mans club
I don't participate in that fake rap stuff
Thanks no thanks I ain't tryin' to make that bluff (make that bluff)
It's the same damn Bub
I've been drinkin' but I ain't that buzzed
Sometimes worse people make great actors
Keep your ass away from me with that fake ass love (that fake ass love)
It's the same damn Bub
This is fun but it ain' that fun
Once down 'til I made that one turn
They end up on they ass came back one (yeah came back one)
It's the same damn Bub
It's the same damn Bub
It's the same damn, it's the same damn, it's the same damn Bud
It's the same damn Bub
It's the same damn, it's the same damn, it's the same damn Bud
