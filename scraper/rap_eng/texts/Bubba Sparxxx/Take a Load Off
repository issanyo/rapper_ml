Oh! (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh! (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh! (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh! here we go

All my mamis right (Oh!)
*Vocal scratches* (Here we go)
All my mamis right (Oh!)
*Vocal scratches* (Here we go)

[Chorus]
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Who else is so rural, but still make you feel urban
Walk up in spine, ask if they can chill Bourbon
Jim Beam, Jack D, Evan Williams, that's me
Tellin' Ginuwine "I love Hank sing in that key"
Now he's lookin' at me, like Bub you alright
Yeah I party dog, but not with them drugs that y'all like
Now where Prada, Hampton and that little fuss is all hype
I want what you want, and that's the busted bra type
Where I come from, white boys ain't lame dog
Honky and all that, the real ones ain't called
Don't pull no bullshit unless you playin' paintball
You a fuckin' felon, yeah but I'm gonna wipe the stank off
CWB, read nothin' to flee
Go on take a load off, I'll clean up the debris
CWB, read nothin' to flee
Go on take a load off, I'll clean up the debris

[Chorus]
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Slowly, homie just get to know me
If we ain't compatible then disown me
But don't tell me your men are for me
If we ain't clique keep some distance on me
On and on, Bubba K no matter what I say
These country folks wouldn't have it, no other way
'Cause I yell, but they ain't got nothin else to say
And I got a heat warm and tucked away
Plus the beep, beep, Timmy keep heat
Him and Rick each, ain't no weak links
Guess I'm just different than whatever you sniffin'
Still the same language, this ain't hieroglyphics
Ask am I prolific? yes sir indeed
Really who are you to be questionin' me
See how I maneuver so effortlessly
You'll be hard pressed to find a fresher MC

[Chorus]
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Free willy, take a load off
Please silly, I ain't takin no loss
He's really got the greatest tone dog
One potato, two potato, three potato don't pause
Betty boo, let it loose, work it for that revenue
Am I not the most uniquest person that you ever knew?
Walk up in the party, sanitation blurtin' with a brew
Bet that this album does all the first one didn't do
Stop with the badgerin', can't you see I'm staggerin'?
All that you babblin', ain't even close to matterin'
What you shouldn't think, you should know that I'm arrogant
My "come talk to Bubba" shirt, tonight I ain't wearin' it

[Chorus]
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)
Hey! (Ah) why you headin' my way (Ah)
What you need to do is
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off, what?)
(Take the load off Willy)
