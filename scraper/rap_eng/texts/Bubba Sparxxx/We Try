[Chorus]
We try to live our lives we try to give advice
No matter what what people gonna still hate us us
We try to keep things real we try to live out here
Deep in the woods woods shotgun bringin' home the good good

[Verse 1: D-Thrash]
We're tryin' to stay in our on lane and do things
Out in the woods 'till I'm walking with the cane man
I ain't gonna bother you so don't you bother me
I'm livin' life independently you see
All day sippin' moonshine to ease my mind
That place in my head is getting harder to find
I try to stay nice but it ain't workin'
I get taken advantage of son and that's certain
People mistaken' kindness for weakness
I'm sittin' here like man I can't believe this
I try to live life right
And still got folks steppin' on my toes out of spite

[Chorus]
We try to live our lives we try to give advice
No matter what what people gonna still hate us us
We try to keep things real we try to live out here
Deep in the woods woods shotgun bringin' home the good good

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
We try we try we try we try hard (hard)
To make sure everything is straight but my Lord (lord)
They knew they couldn't finish it with me so why start (huh)
Can't let the devil bring hell into my heart (no)
My part I played but still the hate came (yep)
Saw it wasn't the way so I made a lane (what it is)
Now the road is paved it stretches eight lanes (eight)
Still they misbehave won't even say my name (what)
Can't complain I'm still shinin' I'm still reclinin' (woo)
On them leather seats when I'm ridin' not abidin' (no)
By the rules of these too cool fools (haha)
I love me and really you do to, tell the truth (tell the truth baby)

[Chorus]
We try to live our lives we try to give advice
No matter what what people gonna still hate us us
We try to keep things real we try to live out here
Deep in the woods woods shotgun bringin' home the good good

[Verse 3: Dez]
Yeah, you watch that, cope it all
With all these know it alls, they get no applause
All you hear is crickets when it's over and the curtain draws
It's all fo' show and I'm grinnin' 'cause it's comedy
Own life's a wreck but now they want to bother me
And tell me how to live my life and what I'm doin' wrong
If it keeps up I promise man it won't be long
Before we have a bad event raid the cabinets
Smith and Wesson is adequate I've had it
Now I'm adamant that I'm gon' straighten it out
Figure it out one way or another
I'm tryin' to breath out but it seems that they wanna smother
And folks actin' like they know me I ain't heard of
I need to back off but y'all got me worked up, hah

[Chorus]
We try to live our lives we try to give advice
No matter what what people gonna still hate us us
We try to keep things real we try to live out here
Deep in the woods woods shotgun bringin' home the good good
