[Chorus]
You gonna get what you want
(What makes a boy scout?)
I'm gonna get what I need
(Is it guns, is it drugs, is it none of the above?)
You gonna get what you want
(Is it a sharecroppers dream to turn this world into a team?)
I'm gonna get what I need
(Or is it the American dream that turns this world into a fiend?)


I be the first to tell you how
Beyond the shadow of a doubt
True artists go without
What's in they heart they spit it out
I play my part and get about
What God commissioned me to do
And the fact that that's my code
Got me pissy in this booth
See it's tricky with the truth
Cos everybody got they own take
I'm a give it how I live it
Till my blood, sweat and bones ache
Watch me bake my own cake
Money mixed with purpose
As long as the hooks made it
All these fickle fish are purchased
Whatever Bubba cast out I pray to him that that's clout
Cos if it's not I'm in the gap
Spittin hot but ass out
And this will be my last bout
In the ring with this demon
Cos my belly don't stay full
When I sing just for dreaming
And my team's just a clinging
Fiendin' for my arrival
So everytime I spit
I'm bringin it for survival
Thinkin I might be liable
To fold at any minute
So if you got some silver
Throw in them pennies wit it

[Chorus]

Didn't miss another favour
Bubba's bringin' to the shindig
Rollin round peakin
Like my license ain't suspended
Huh, ain't it splended
Perhaps a bit of blotter
Brought that shit to the hood
And now your trap's a little hotter
In fact that's how they got ya
With all them party favors
See they infiltrated y'all
With the beast of our behaviour
Let you sell it for a minute
Take some for your enjoyment
The next thing you know
The troops is rallied for deployment
In your yard with twenty doggies
They probably won't bark
But they still bit yo ass
Tell Betty to get the cash
That you had stashed at momma's
Get you back on dry land
I thank them higher track of powers
As you raise your right hand
Have you ever wondered why
I don't approach you at a venue
Like buddy where the beans
Like you know it's on the menu
Yeah I spoke to him too
He came at me the same
Told him naw but I'm looking
Now get away from me you lame

[Chorus]

I told several caucazoids
That don't toot but do shoot
Got two cousins in La Grange
Hard like Bo and Luke Duke
So push that woop woop
When you on they dirt road
Cos if you tryna shout
They make you whine like merlot
And bet, I sure know
Six blondes with big asses
That apply the suction cup
Every time my dick passes
Plus I got battallions
Assembled with Nitti Beatz
So next time you out in Athens
Remember to yell at me
So I can page Duddy Ken
To give clearance for your appearance
Look at this new south
The spirit of my deliverance
So with that shit said
We obviously years ahead
That's why I don't fuck wit y'all
I just keep to my peers instead

[Chorus]
