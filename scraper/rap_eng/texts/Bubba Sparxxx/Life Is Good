[Chorus: Crucifix]
Pour that drink up in my cup and homeboy turn that music up, let’s sit back and enjoy this day like today’s the last. No I ain’t got too much money, but what I got you can’t take from me... I got family, faith and I still got me some breath to breathe. Boy life is good

[Verse 1: Crucifix]
Sometimes I just get caught up, quick to forgetting the way that I was brought up. Running around town pissed, fists balled up, remembering everything but what my mama taught us; “In a world so cold, pave your own path or walk a beat road. Try to get money but don’t let it be your goal, or gain the whole world and still lose your own soul.” I’d rather be poor and learn to love the way that feels than rob and steal to make my meals or pay my bills. God, I’m really trying to understand that the pain is just the frame to show the man that I am. And I’m gonna wake up in the morning knowing life gon’ be hard, but that’s another reason just to keep on talking to God. And it’s a bet, I’ll come out a little bit scarred, but I can wake up in the morning and know which side that I’m on

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
In any event I’m plenty content. Of my sins I repent, then give me the rent, and try to give it my best then give Him the rest. I was losing with more... been winning with less. I need to reevaluate what more is, is it more bullshit? Or is it more really more about more closeness with the Big Man? Hey I'm a big fan, and I can withstand, I can endure... I can persevere because I'm ensured  by faith and that leaves no room for fear no more... Turn the music up!

[Chorus: Crucifix]

[Verse 3: Skinny Deville, Big V, Fish Scales]
It could be better if I tried harder. My caddy's in the shop I guess I gotta ride the Marta. But I thank God I'm alive, that's what I do for starters. God will provide so I grind for my sons and daughter. My house is under water swimming in a sea of debt, but my faith is strong and Lord knows I need some help. But every cloud has a silver lining so don't forget, what goes down must come up now to catch a breath
Mama keeps praying, the world don't stop spinnin'... What makes a loser lose?  What makes a winner win? Win or lose, learn young or forever be a damn fool. Fail and quit, that's what the weak do. I'm a fighter y'all, morning, noon and night. Tito Ortiz, Mike Tyson, Kimbo Slice... Life gives me lemons, I'm gon' make pie, then I can use the peeling to make the stars rise!
Milledgeville bound... I love a small town you ain't gotta have money, they're just glad you're around. I could've been a lot of places but I'm out here free. The best things in life come without no fee. The few people that ain't here truly will be missed, pour a shot to the ground before I take my sip. It's been a long road, a lot of hardship. But I'm glad for the ride so regardless... Life Is Good!
