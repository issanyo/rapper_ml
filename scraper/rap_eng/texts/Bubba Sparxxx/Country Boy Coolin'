[Verse 1]
I'm thinkin' I'm knowin' I'm comin' you better believe (oh yeah)
The people that's with us ain't with it then tell 'em to leave (get the fuck out of here)
I'm stackin' my money this time I won't piss it away (no)
Help me lord to do all the shit that I say
Any way I'm just coolin' whatcha doin' girl (uh)
Stick a fork in this dork and come to the fort
'Cause I'm the closest thing to the number one stunna (stunna)
Your country ass'll never dream of seein' run lover
I'm feelin' out of here (gone) I'm walkin' like a G
If you ain't talkin' 'bout greatness well then don't talk to me
These guys love to talk (talk), but they ain't fond of doin'
They fond of suein' and boo hooin' I'm coolin'

[Chorus]
I know that no one can see me so soothin'
No stress I'm just country boy coolin'
Extra special is Whitney she wanna move in
Uh uh I'm just country boy coolin'
It's no discussion of drama we just shootin'
Tell the law I was country boy coolin'
They talk about me a lot don't mean I'm doin' it
Yeah man I'm just country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy coolin'

[Verse 2]
You love me you hate me the truth is it's matterin' none (zero)
I've given I've taken but fuck it the damage is done (oh yeah)
The race isn't over my goal is to finish strong (strong)
Strong and silent but they shout if I did it wrong (fuck 'em)
Movin' on hit my phone if it's 'bout twerk
Besides that a lot of talkin' make my mouth hurt
And my ears think I really must avoid that
At all cost anything I get annoyed at
'Cause I'm coolin' but my partner still doin'
And loyalty's in tune with every such and such we doin' (eh)
I finally know it, deep in my heart of hearts
That I'm the only one that can see Bubba Sparxxx

[Chorus]
I know that no one can see me so soothin'
No stress I'm just country boy coolin'
Extra special is Whitney she wanna move in
Uh uh I'm just country boy coolin'
It's no discussion of drama we just shootin'
Tell the law I was country boy coolin'
They talk about me a lot don't mean I'm doin' it
Yeah man I'm just country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy country boy country boy coolin'
Country boy coolin'
