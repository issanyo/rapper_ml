Uh-uh.. wassup ladies?
Bubba can't forget about y'all..

(Intro)
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin'
He Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations

I left yesterday, and I headed straight, up 78, to the A-T-L
These record sales done paid me well, so I'm smoking good, can't you smell?
Life is hell, till you drop a gem, now Bubba got hoes, jocking him
Not cuz he cute, cuz he got that loot, wear Polo suits, and that's hot to them
I see your ass, over at the bar, try your best to fill up that bra
A double-D, sippin' bubbl-y and you'd give your life just to fuck with me
Reluctantly I walk on by, I'm not gon' lie, that Betty fine
But I got to drank, can't even thank, unless I'm tanked, I'm already high
So let it fly, miss Kimberly, I can see right now you into me
Im'a holla at you bout 10 till 3, tryin' to switch from Beam to Hennessey
But you know I can't, so give me Jimmy
And sit right down till the bottles empty
Then we cut, but now shut up, old stupid slut, I stated simply
4 AM, we back in Athens, rollin' balls, and the bitch is laughin'
Chalk the first one, up to rappin'
I waited years, but tonight it happen

(CHORUS)
Hey Betty Betty, hush your mouth, let me tell you something
Hey Betty Betty, this Bubba K, the one your boyfriend bumpin
Hey Betty Betty, understand, see I ain't got no patience
Hey Betty Betty, get in the truck, lets crank up these relations
Hey Betty Betty, I'm tryin' to see if you adventurous
Hey Betty Betty, I only mess with 9's and 10's and up
Hey Betty Betty, you got some things, I'd love to photograph
Hey Betty Betty, you heard a while, but you don't know the half

I missed you Betty, since I last, saw your ass at the Polo Club
What's the matter, can't show no love?
I guess you here bout them photos of, you and me on the internet
Get over there, we ain't finished yet
I got a new, cam-er-a, miss Pam-el-a, and I'm fin to let
Bobby introduce you to the helicopter, and when he through
I bet its clear, why crackers here, ain't trying to hear, another word from you
I'm certain to, attract a virus, cuz using rubbers, don't excite us
If you ain't cutting, don't invite us, and I won't return, if you stole the nighters
Don't deny us, we them boys, talkin' bout you sing with a pretty voice
Just to fuck, and now your buck, all in my face, you made a shitty choice
I get it moist every time I touch it, freaky deaky all out in public
And guess where Mr. Sparxxx erupted?
In her grill, but still, she loved it

(CHORUS)

Now you might see me, ridin' 'Lac, with Rodney Black, on a coochie chase
Or you might catch me with chunky Shan, at some slightly tan, white groupie's place
Then booty shake, Betty's got, a special spot in Bubbas heart
Puttin' cheese to her college degree, but a lot of fleas shake it up for free
If it was up to me, you'd be with me, sippin' Beam, ridin' in between
Lagrange and Athens, if you love me, engrave my name on your nipple ring
I'm spiffy clean, when it comes to females, sex with me only ups your resale
Blazin' quarters, up to ounces, keep the dimes, they done nixed the Sprewell
How that weed smell? Oh I know it, that's how these Georgia crackers grow it
You getting high to every time you blow it, if you feelin' freaky, why won't you show it?
I don't mind, Shan don't mind, Jed don't mind, WE don't mind
But if u scared, get on from here, cuz frankly dear, we don't need your kind

(CHORUS)
