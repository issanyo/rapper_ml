[Verse 1]
The only time life is the craziest, when I'm with my baby
I got me a good one, but still, girl, you gon' get this whoopin'
If you love my crazy, then I love your crazy already
Long as you love me all night you could hate me all day
B-U-BB-to the-A and this just how I'm rockin'
Classic, see heavy Chevelle, in the whip, down the block, on the block
People, they no longer people and evil is legal
And tomorrow could be me, could be you

[Chorus]
They gon' try hard to blow my day
But they won't blow my day
I'm only here for a little while
And I'm gon' enjoy my stay
They gon' try hard so I pray
Stand up and go on my way
The whole damn world's gone wild
It's okay, you know what I say, oh?
You know what I say? I say it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma slow down
Not now, it ain't no way
Oh, it ain't no way, nah nah, it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma fold now
Not now, it ain't no way, oh, woo

[Verse 2]
Full speed ahead, I don't know how to put in reverse
No matter how much it hurts, I just put in that work
I put in my heart and my soul and my guts and my nuts
But goin' all in and then winnin' is such a big rush
They clap when you comin', I'm standin' all day when you plumbin'
They make it up just to discuss it, I come through to numb it
It's just a mirage, you thought that it was when it wasn't
And without it I'm nothing, I love it

[Chorus]
They gon' try hard to blow my day
But they won't blow my day
I'm only here for a little while
And I'm gon' enjoy my stay
They gon' try hard so I pray
Stand up and go on my way
The whole damn world's gone wild
It's okay, you know what I say, oh
You know what I say? I say it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma slow down
Not now, it ain't no way
Oh, it ain't no way, nah nah, it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma fold now
Not now, it ain't no way

They gon' try hard to blow my day
But they won't blow my day
I'm only here for a little while
And I'm gon' enjoy my stay
They gon' try hard so I pray
Stand up and go on my way
The whole damn world's gone wild
It's okay, you know what I say, oh
You know what I say? I say it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma slow down
Not now, it ain't no way
Oh, it ain't no way, nah nah, it ain't no way
It ain't no way I'ma fold now
Not now, it ain't no way, oh
