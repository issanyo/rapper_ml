Woo-wee!
Okay okay

I make a livin doin what the hell I wanna do
They still tellin you about it, I was showin you
In a black El Camino with a new se√±orita
And a chrome-plated nina, come see me (c'mon)
These young country boys wanna be me
But to be me, you gon' have to be me
And that's a hundred hour work week
Pourin concrete dirt cheap, no that's not easy
Prayin in the moonlight tryin to do right
Please God, show me what it look like
Does it look like money? Does it look like Playboy bunnies?
How 'bout just money?
If not then it may not be funny
"Made in Georgia" tatted on my tummy
He told a joke when he said that's what he want
Cause really no he don't, I'm laughin cause it's funny
I pulled up with your sister Sunday
Pulled up with her bestie Monday
That's-that's-that's that dirt road mackin
Soak up these three lessons from me
(Here we go!) You was confused
You should be un-confused now
Hater get up on your horse
Get up on your horse and just ride out of town

Turn it up, it's goin down
We gonna party when the sun goes down
If you ain't wit it, don't come around
Get on your horse and ride out of town

Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
Get, get, get-get up! (Ride outta town)

Best around and blow me ten million dollars
Like it was your truckload, homeboy holler
And just as soon as I get another ten
I'ma make her head spin doin it again
I ain't that worried, I ain't concerned
Sat a few out, now takin my turn
Did what I did, got what I got
Should I be alive? Probably not
Probably still I honestly feel
Like I'm for real a pretty big deal
Country and trill, 30-inch wheels
Back in this thang, that's what it is
I can get money, I can go broke
Either way it go I'ma be with my folks
Bubba ain't dead, y'all just scared
That must be why he ain't say what he said
What goes around comes right back around
Hater get up on your horse
Get up on your horse and just ride out of town

Turn it up, it's goin down
We gonna party when the sun goes down
If you ain't wit it, don't come around
Get on your horse and ride out of town

Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
Get, get, get-get up!

Turn it up, it's goin down
We gonna party when the sun goes down
If you ain't wit it, don't come around
Get on your horse and ride out of town

Turn it up, it's goin down
We gonna party when the sun goes down
If you ain't wit it, don't come around
Get on your horse and ride out of town

Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
(Ride outta town, ride outta town)
Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
(Get on your horse)
Get-get up! (Ride outta town)
