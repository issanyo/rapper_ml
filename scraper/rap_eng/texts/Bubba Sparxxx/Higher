[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Jack it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Raise it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Yeah we gonna take it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 1: Lenny Cooper]
Yeah I'm gonna take it real high, how high
So high so that I'm chuckin' deuces at NASA when they fly by
Let me paint a vision my truck Mud Dynasty Edition
Equipped with Rough Country Suspension
Girls wanna get up in it, one arm around the wheel one around you baby
Yeah I'm country boy pimpin', got the sub woofers kickin'
She said you want to hear my song rodeo
I turned it up said "baby lets go" tearin' down back roads
Non-stop hubs locked clutch pop I'm tellin' you nothin' about my truck's stock
Loud pipes, you can't miss me with the bright lights
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do tonight

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Jack it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (yeah)
Raise it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (woo-wee)
Yeah we gonna take it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (come on)

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Me and Lenny Cooper nothin' new we bend the truth
And yes we jack 'em up way higher than these sissy's seem to do (ooh)
That Bubba K. is only ridin' Chevrolet
And if you  don't get out my way then there's gon' be hell to pay (hey)
Them thirty-somethin's would be cute on my girls truck
Hop up off my dick this little bitty and put your purse up (haha)
Either that or just holla' at me whenever you're stuck
Say you heard I won't rip it up I say you heard what
What that's when I pulled up
It ain't a lion that's roarin' no sir it's just Bub in that big truck
And now I'm fittin' to clown if you ain't sittin' high you just be sittin' down

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Jack it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Raise it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Yeah we gonna take it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

[Verse 3: Kalan Miller]
Okay the Chevrolet on 44's down to say it's sky high
I'm lookin' down and chuckin' up the deuces when I ride by
Cherry bomb tips poppin' at 'em like a drive by
Super swampers on that thing pokin' out a mile wide
It's just a country boy dream the way that we are livin'
Make the girls fall in love just with the suspension
Join the mile high club when she climb in the truck
Turn the radio loud and fire it up
Smash on it in four low and tear it up
Hit a country back road and burn it up
We 'bout to take the game as high as it will go
And you can tell by the way we been burnin' coal

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Jack it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Raise it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Yeah we gonna take it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher

I'm gonna make it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Jack it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Raise it up a little higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
Yeah we gonna take it higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher
