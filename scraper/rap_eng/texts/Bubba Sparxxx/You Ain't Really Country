[Intro]
You say you country (say your country say your country)
Ye-ye-you say you country (say your country say your country)
Ye-ye-you say you country (say your country say your country)
Ye-ye-ye-ye-ye

[Chorus: D Thrash]
You say you country but you ain’t really country man
You wearin' boots that ain’t never seen a mud stand
You drive a truck that ain’t even in your own name
You really more like a yuppie, that’s what you should claim
You dippin' pouches, man you on some other shit
The only country you’ve seen is on a news clip
I pass the moonshine and you won’t even take a sip
You say you country but buddy I think you need a sip

[Verse 1: D Thrash]
I seen that truck that you ridin' and it’s too clean
It looks slow but you claimin' that it’s too mean
If you were me you’d be drivin' that bitch six feet deep
In the mud where all of my country folks be
But you a fake boy, you like to make noise
Hair spiked frosted tips, look like a cake boy
So what ya say boy, you wanna prove me wrong
Then he looks at his watch and he’s gone
I guess daddy had to get his truck back
He left so fast he didn’t grab his Abercrombie hat (haha)
I picked it up and threw it in the mud
Yeah buddy, that’s how I showin' em’ love
Come on

[Chorus: D Thrash]
You say you country but you ain’t really country man
You wearin' boots that ain’t never seen a mud stand
You drive a truck that ain’t even in your own name
You really more like a yuppie, that’s what you should claim
You dippin' pouches, man you on some other shit
The only country you’ve seen is on a news clip
I pass the moonshine and you won’t even take a sip
You say you country but buddy I think you need a sip

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
You away from the woods, you away from the hood
You must be from the suburbs
Never skin a buck, never ridin' in a truck
I get it you’a a nerd
Never drink Shine or the Muscadine wine
You only drink that merlot
Come around here, they gonna see it real clear
Yeah buddy we for sure know
I’m authentic, jump all in it
Might just have me a country boy clinic
That be the only way y'all can get it
Dove right there is the target hit it
Set that post, run that barbed wire
Better yet start slow, set that bar fire
Better yet can you even change a car tire, uh, no
Oh, we really got a long way to go
You ain’t country dog and it shows
You get lost on all of them roads
So just hop back in that Prius and see us when you see us
Butthead say hey to Beavis

[Chorus: D Thrash]
You say you country but you ain’t really country man
You wearin' boots that ain’t never seen a mud stand
You drive a truck that ain’t even in your own name
You really more like a yuppie, that’s what you should claim
You dippin' pouches, man you on some other shit
The only country you’ve seen is on a news clip
I pass the moonshine and you won’t even take a sip
You say you country but buddy I think you need a sip
