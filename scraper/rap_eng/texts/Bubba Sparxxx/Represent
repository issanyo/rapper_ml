I'm supposed to represent

[Verse 1]
I'm too motherfuckin raw to be all, worried if these broads, is fuckin with me
Y'all can suck my right and left nut with the same slurp
Nomore of the fames perks, I'm back in LeGrange hurt
Can't work, same dirt I thought I had wiped off
The same jerk that used to jerk Paul now he's my boss
Lonely if I lost, my light on the pathway
Nomore Bubba K., just as white as a trash day
Say you can take the boy out of the country
But can't take the country out the boy, even with money
I believe it was funny, I was deceivingly burning
At the Four Seasons, all four seasons with Sunny
But I'll be just fine, the grind's in my bloodline
It's what's in your guts time, baby I'm one rhyme
From being what that man paid me to be
Wasn't no concrete but I was raised by the streets

[Hook]
It's your turn, you supposed to represent
Do yo thang, you supposed to represent
Stop Playin', you supposed to represent
It's only right, you supposed to represent
It's your turn, you supposed to represent
Do yo thang, you supposed to represent
Stop Playin', you supposed to represent
Not only get money, you supposed to represent

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you gotta lose yourself to find out where you really are
Let the cut burn then you know you earned it when it scars
I been a star, my name rang bells
But it means not a thing if it can't bring sales
If you ain't seen hell you should get a load of this
Just a dose of hopelessness while you sip your Mo and Cris
If I ain't on your list, shit you can't win them all
But until he died, most of y'all ain't fuck wit Biggie Smalls
Atleast south of D.C. and west of Pittsbrug
That points, they don't know you 'til you resting in dirt
If resting is sure, a loser isn't sexiness
So make me the deadliest, MC I guess it just
Wasn't meant that I be mentioned with the greatest spittin then
Lord atleast let me get it up and pay the rent again
You may intend to win but my alternative's
The coffin or the furnacing, talking more determinant

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What, you think I'm scared, you think I'm a pussy?
Really now, how far did you think you can push me?
Before I snap, just like that and bust back
Fear, he don't live around here, what's that?
What, you think I'm scared, you think I'm a pussy?
Really now, how far did you think you can push me?
Before I snap, just like that and bust back
Fear, he don't live around here, what's that?

[Verse 3]
Just stack, get your mind right and get your cheddar better
Volcano gone erupt, it won't lay at rest forever
Every level of the game, these country boys gettin to it
Nothin but your lips is movin, Hush you body shit and do it
I been knew it, you don't wanna jump bad
Hatin escalates and you don't want it to become that
I'm from that, dying breed of white MC
That knows what it's like to be told it ain't right to be
Rappin, now adapting just so happens it's the thing now
To get a cracker on your roster since Marshall came out
I can't explain how, vital time it is
Even now I wouldn't exchange our lives, mine for his
Like this

[Hook]
