[Intro]
Moonshine Bandits (Bandits)

[Chorus: Bird]
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low

[Verse 1: Tex]
Mama told me slow down, fast livin' is my motto
Everything I do, you know I do it full throttle
You can have the can but I'll take the whole bottle
Six shots slam but you'll never see me hobble
Write a jack up, you got flats on a bottle
Angel ridin' shotgun, black Silverado
Dive bar beauty queen lookin' like a model
Law on my tail 'cause I'm livin' full throttle

[Chorus: Bird]
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
You love me, love me, way out in the country like damn
Senior, junior, bring it to you like mail
I might fail, but hey, I might sale
Enough to tell, y'all the hushin', hush it well
What the hell is Bubba doin'? He just a ruin
That brand new Chevy, and damn you Betty, he wasn't bored
I heard he put them 44's up underneath it
He did a year and since he did, it's been tough to reach him
Either hate it or let it motivate
Life is goin' great, yeah, it's goin' great
Ain't too much more to say, truck runnin' great
Color muddy grey, won't put my gun away
Obama, Osama, the Dalai Lama
My mama, Trump or Clinton, maybe my mama
'Cause bitch I'm a big dog, 5150
And I'm all jacked up so is anyone with me

[Chorus: Bird]
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low

[Verse 3: Tex]
I'm goin' full throttle while you stop and go
Motor so hot make you drop and roll
Livin' real fast never lost control
Even when the cops tried to stop my show
Straight to the top like a rocket, whoa
Little hip hop with some rock 'n' roll
Count down on the clock, oh no
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, let's go

[Bridge: Bird]
I'm fillin' up my cup and I might act up
Fillin' up my cup and I might act up
I'm fillin' up my cup and I might act up
Fillin' up my cup and I might act up
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)

[Chorus: Bird]
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Everybody get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low
Get loose, get out of control
5150 and we locked in low

[Outro: Bird]
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
I'm jacked up, (Jacked up) I'm jacked up (Jacked up)
