[Verse 1: [?] of I4NI, Bubba Sparxxx]
Uhh it's I4NI
Chevy truck sittin' up high in the sky
Lookin' down on 'em like why would you try
Team strong unified ride or collide
When it's time to go call the boys load up 'cause that's how we roll (What)
AVJ and we're lockin' the game down
They done let us in and it won't be the same now
Yup yup they ain't seen nothin' yet
Said Bubba K was through care to take another bet
Big bank mudcat in the fish tank
Mixed drink in my left hand which ain't
Nothin' but a whole lotta Jack D
A little bit of Coca-Cola baby that's me
That's me the one that got the party started
One to his thang and rappers scatter like somebody farted (Eww)

[Chorus: [?]]
We like our Chevy's high speakers bumpin' low
We bring that southern pride everywhere we go
We're just good ol' boys that stay right down the road
If you mess with one you're gone get us all
That that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll

[Verse 2: Demun Jones, C-Hubb, & Fatt Tarr]
Jones County
Rollin' this way and you're gonna hear about me
Georgia redneck go dogs and all that
Deep and deep-fried big trucks they all jacked
Bump that, pass the red flag and straw hat
Fall back brought the click clack and ball bat
Talk that 'cause I walk that
Got plenty of bullets buddy so you don't wanna talk that (Ha)
Run your mouth like a big block get cold cocked
Leave a big knot on your soft spot
But you ought not walk where the big boys fox trot tango
Boomerang bang dang hick-hop
Get lost down the road 'cause now you know that's how we roll
We bound to blow right out the door
Speakin' a down the road
I gotta mow and 'till cause the grass is growed bo

[Chorus: [?]]
We like our Chevy's high speakers bumpin' low
We bring that southern pride everywhere we go
We're just good ol' boys that stay right down the road
If you mess with one you're gone get us all
That that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll

[Verse 3: J. Rosevelt & [?],]
We got the beer keg loaded on up
Got the system bumpin' in the party like what
Parked up in the driveway all Chevy trucks
Jacked up so high we don't ever get stuck
Hard shine up in my cup
You ain't know county folk love to turn up
Real southern folk call close friends blood
Don't start nothin' won't nothin' sho nuff
Shannon gave me the wheel and told me throw it in gear
And now we finally here
When the shit hits the fan man they all disappear
Everybody gettin' mad 'cause this is our year (Oh)
If there's one thing that I know
If you mess with one you're gonna get the whole damn load
When you see that many trucks comin' down the road
You know that's just how we roll come on

[Chorus: [?]]
We like our Chevy's high speakers bumpin' low
We bring that southern pride everywhere we go
We're just good ol' boys that stay right down the road
If you mess with one you're gone get us all
That that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll

[Verse 4: Bird & Tex of Moonshine Bandits, Uncle Snap & Rooster]
Redneck spittin' like red man chew
Bottle with the zip but the flames still blue
Bowtie lifted with the kicker hittin' too
This is how we roll and how the west get's loose
Two more shots and a camel crush
Then we head on down the road
'Cause raisin' hell when it's in our blood (Let's roll)
And that's just how we roll
Some of y'all think this country an act
Well y'all can kiss my country ass
Me and I4NI with a black tooth grin
Too high to drive so we called up a friend
Gettin' low on cash but I'll still run by
Go and hit that hole before the creek runs dry
If I call them folks and the place gets live
Shit it ain't no life that's just how we ride

[Chorus: [?]]
We like our Chevy's high
Speakers bumpin' low
We bring that southern pride
Everywhere we go
We're just good ol' boys that stay right down the road
If you mess with one you're gone get us all
That that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll
Roll roll roll roll roll roll
And that's just how we roll
