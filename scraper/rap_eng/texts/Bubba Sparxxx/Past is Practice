[Intro: Bubba Sparxxx]
I was talkin' about the past the other night with my pops
And he said "Son we all got regrets all that we can do is accept that it's over learn from it and move on"

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
He said you got it all wrong you gotta move on
You can't keep singin' that sad ol' song
You have to fight to urge to reminisce
You can push rewind in your mind
It ain't nothin' but a waste of time
Today's the day get past this
'Cause the past is practice

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Another long night down in GA watchin' my whole life replay
Under my eye lids everything I did  still rides with me these days
How could I let her love go how could I let my life get
This out of hand I'm talkin' bout the man this here is right where I sit
I was raised on deep southern values
Life treats you just like how you
Treat life, you better think twice
But if you blink twice it goes on without you
I'm sittin' here livin' in circles
Somehow I gotta turn it into a straight line
I know anything worth havin' takes time
But if patience is a virtue it ain't mine
I ain't ever been concerned with tomorrow
But yesterday visits me nightly
At the bottom of a glass just waitin' on my ass to tell me what might be
Had I cut it out sooner, or had I held on longer
Then I hear a voice in my head so clear
The past is practice it makes you stronger

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
He said you got it all wrong you gotta move on
You can't keep singin' that sad ol' song
You have to fight to urge to reminisce
You can push rewind in your mind
It ain't nothin' but a waste of time
Today's the day get past this
'Cause the past is practice

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I see now the blessin's the lesson
What's that sayin' what's that expression
Yesterday's history tomorrow's a mystery today is a gift that's why they call it present
I know that sounds good, when you're sayin' it to somebody else
But when it's your turn and your heart hurts it ain't really a whole lot of help
But it's like my pops says everybody's got regrets I guess
Try as you might, cry and fight it they ain't gon' change it so why stress
But we can change tomorrow, with a well played today
The lights are on and life goes on
Until it don't which makes you say

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
He said you got it all wrong you gotta move on
You can't keep singin' that sad ol' song
You have to fight to urge to reminisce
You can push rewind in your mind
It ain't nothin' but a waste of time
Today's the day get past this
'Cause the past is practice

[Bridge]
I mean the fact is there is no finer way to waste time
Than to be caught up obsession about the past
It's gone, it's gone forever move on love today

[Chorus: JJ Lawhorn]
He said you got it all wrong you gotta move on
You can't keep singin' that sad ol' song
You have to fight to urge to reminisce
You can push rewind in your mind
It ain't nothin' but a waste of time
Today's the day get past this
'Cause the past is practice
