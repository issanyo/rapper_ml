[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
This morning it was colder than a mother-in-law's love
But look at that sunshine the Lord brought us
My baby cooked a breakfast that was heavy on the hog
Now pushin' that Chevy through the early mornin' fog
And I'm thinkin', reflectin' on the blessings I'm collectin'
Just to live a simple life free of stress is my objective
Shit does happen but it's less than I expected
More times than not, so I guess it's 'bout perspective
My dog eats cow turds, it could always be worse
He could like my turds in the toilet, teeth first
My truck ain't new, but it's new-ish
Which wouldn't make a difference, the mud is an inch thick
And if my woman's talkin' then she's probably fussin'
About a lotta nothin', still we do a lotta lovin'
You gotta love it, every day's a good day
Just some are better than others, I guess you could say

[Chorus: Lamar Williams, Jr.]
Livin' every day like it's my birthday
'Cause ain't no tellin' when your call's comin' in
I know somebody gotta party, it's a Friday night
And ain't nobody trippin'
Got a full tank of gas, cold case of beer
My dog and my woman don't disappear 'til the sun comes up

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Pretty much every one of my friends drink beer
Until their piss is but their vision ain't clear
And the cats in my yard are seventh generations (Seventh generation)
Inbred, if six dead, then ten replace 'em
But today I'm just making the choice to love it all (Love it)
What's a couple flaws? That don't bother Bubba, naw
My co-workers is goin' berzerk, what the hell?
The bossman trippin' too, hey, it's just as well
Either way, I must prevail, a good day
Becomes a great day when your perception ain't gray
I may pray but after that, I gotta live it
Gotta help you help yourself, do not forget it
I bought a lottery ticket and won another ticket
That's how he gives you another day, do somethin' wit' it
If I open my eyes then I'm a success
Just blessed, I'm alive, so what's stress?

[Chorus: Lamar Williams, Jr.]
Livin' every day like it's my birthday
'Cause ain't no tellin' when your call's comin' in
I know somebody gotta party, it's a Friday night
And ain't nobody trippin'
Got a full tank of gas, cold case of beer
My dog and my woman don't disappear 'til the sun comes up

[Bridge: Lamar Williams, Jr.]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Lamar Williams, Jr.]
Livin' every day like it's my birthday
'Cause ain't no tellin' when your call's comin' in
I know somebody gotta party, it's a Friday night
And ain't nobody trippin'
Got a full tank of gas, cold case of beer
My dog and my woman don't disappear 'til the sun comes up
'Til the sun comes up, 'til sun comes up, 'til sun comes up, 'til the sun comes up
'Til the sun comes up, 'til sun comes up, 'til sun comes up, 'til the sun comes up
