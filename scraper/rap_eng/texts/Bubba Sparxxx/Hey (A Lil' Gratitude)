[Hook]
Yeah I'm a country boy, but I'm a player too
All up in your city flexin' down the avenue
But I ain't mad at you dog, that's what I had to do
That least that you could do is gimme a lil' gratitude
Hey, everybody wanna say hey, Timmy
Get into it or be on your way, hey
And I really hate it came to this
How else can I say it, I don't speak no other languages

[Verse 1]
I came to do two things, kick some ass
And drink some coke, yeah, and I'm almost out of beer
Looky here, we damned if every other year
He ain't stumble back in, Bubba, baby that's him
I love me some me, and I don't mind you
Shoot ya move dog, we lovin' whatcha tryin'a do
Just do it over there, I feel some kinda away
I guess what I'm tryin'a say is I ain't got no time to play
I might just die today, I might just live forever
I done endured being poor but being rich is better
From that dirt road in the grange I did came
A long way, we can do this all day

[Hook]
Yeah I'm a country boy, but I'm a player too
All up in your city flexin' down the avenue
But I ain't mad at you dog, that's what I had to do
That least that you could do is gimme a lil' gratitude
Hey, everybody wanna say hey
Get into it or be on your way, hey
And I really hate it came to this
How else can I say it, I don't speak no other languages

[Bridge]
Hey, everybody wanna say hey
Get into it or be on your way, hey
And I really hate it came to this
How else can I say it, I don't speak no other languages

[Verse 2]
Ain't no excuses, just gotta be more the shit
Than I already was and that's unfortunate
For all these babblers, still booty chatterers
This what a rapper was supposed to be and that's what's up
Country this, yeah yeah, country that
I'm a country cat, it's just a fact, can't run from that
Keep high, a bunch out back, now watch the money stack
Hide in the hay, in the barn out on the farm
I can charm, the fangs off a cotton mouth
Right there by my house way out in the south
Know what I'm talkin' bout, it would appear no
Girl who's that zero, I am the hero, y'all

[Hook]
Yeah I'm a country boy, but I'm a player too
All up in your city flexin' down the avenue
But I ain't mad at you dog, that's what I had to do
That least that you could do is gimme a lil' gratitude
Hey, everybody wanna say hey
Get into it or be on your way, hey
And I really hate it came to this
How else can I say it, I don't speak no other languages

[Bridge]
Hey, everybody wanna say hey
Get into it or be on your way, hey
And I really hate it came to this
How else can I say it, I don't speak no other languages

[Verse 3]
Yeah yeah it's Bubba K, I plans to give 'em hell
Yesiree I did my thang and I did it well
I walk the walk baby, and all that daddy tells
I ain't even noticed my skin, damn, is it pale
Oh well, I guess that how it go
Now I know, move right along down the row
Another good morning, another breath of air
Dude I don't ask for much, still I got blessings everywhere
And I ain't scared to share, you can have my last
But you ever diss on me and mine that's yo ass
You hear that thang beatin', Timmy still speakin'
That's how real I keep it, everything else our little secret, whoa

[Hook]
Yeah I'm a country boy, but I'm a player too
All up in your city flexin' down the avenue
But I ain't mad at you dog, that's what I had to do
That least that you could do is gimme a lil' gratitude
