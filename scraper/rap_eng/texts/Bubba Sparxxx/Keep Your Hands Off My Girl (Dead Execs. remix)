Let the record play
Let the record play
Let the record play

The way that you dance, the way that you move
The way that you stare at me across the room
You carry Dior bags and you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hangin' from my neck in my chain
I got a model, 26, but she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playin' the same old song
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playin' the same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

Now she sweatin' my friends and my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin, my Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say "What's up?", so what does she do?
She just stays posted up the other side of the room
I got AMC tattooed on my hand
I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana

And the record keeps playin' the same old song
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playin' the same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

She, she, she don't wanna talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about
Me, me, I don't wanna fight about it
I just wanna be up out it
I'm just tryin' to stay up out it
Step out the wagon, you know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with him, they like "that's not the boy she dates"
They get to fightin' and swearin' and now the boyfriend is starin'
The disco ball on the ceilin' looks like the chain that I'm wearin'
But the music keeps blarin'

I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playin' the same old song
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

And the record keeps playin' the same old song
The hipsters mean muggin' on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

You carry Dior bags and you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hangin' from my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hangin' from my neck in my chain
