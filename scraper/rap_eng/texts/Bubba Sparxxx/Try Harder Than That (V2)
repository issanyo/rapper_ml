[Verse 1: Meghan Linsey]
Hey boy, you know I'm on to your game boy
No I won't be another play toy playboy
No I'm not down with that
You can give me your best try
Come on give me one of your best lines
Don't play me a song about tan lines or takin' a ride
'Cause I'm so done with that

[Chorus: Meghan Linsey]
You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that

[Verse 2: Meghan Linsey]
Hey boy
Dial it back a notch let's take it slow
'stead of layin' me down why don't we
Lay low you can get to know me
See where this thing goes

[Chorus: Meghan Linsey]
You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
So I've been listen to you Meg
I'm a country boy and I like to wyle out but
Hop up in this truck mamma lets go get stuck mamma
I'm just playin' I'm just sayin' I love mamma
My mamma so you know I comprehend
I got the message I've learned the lesson
I might have been a bit shallow
Yesterday but today and tomorrow
Do it right is my motto
Trust me I know I got to try a lot harder
To win over your pops daughter
That's you baby

[Chorus: Meghan Linsey]
You're gonna have to try harder than that to get a girl like this
More than a back road moonlight kiss
Cherry red lipstick, cut-off jeans
Every woman in the world knows what I mean
If you're lookin' for a girl that'll hop in your truck
Maybe get lost, maybe get stuck
You might think you're cool now
But it ain't gonna last
To get a girl like this
You're gonna have to try harder than that

[Outro]
Ohh You're gonna have to try harder than
Hey girl (Bubba Sparxxx) why don't you hop up in my truck (you gotta love it)
Lets go tear it up (Meghan Linsey)
It's how we do
(Gotta try harder than that)
(haha don't I know it)
