[Intro]
It don't matter if she's from up top
Listens to rock-and-roll or hip-hop
And it's cool if she's smokin' hot
But hey, she better be country

[Verse 1]
Country is country wild, like the song say
I know a girl in Arizona with some long legs
She looks like Pocahontas on steroids
And she wild, wears country fresh airborne
I know another one in Montana, that Hannah
And she's totally into it, mind grammar
I got another one in West Hollywood
I love her tho' she acts more Dolly Wood
Country is a state of mind and a state of heart
And they don't keep that locked outta trailer parks
Every girl in the country ain't true to it
You wanna act cityfied, move true to it
I know one in Rochester, use to see her booty, man
God bless her! (Hallelujah)
And she cruise like she oughta be from [?]
And she even puts grizz with the heavy bacon

[Hook]
It don't matter if she's from up-top
Listens to rock-and-roll or hip-hop
And it's cool if she's smokin' hot
But hey, she betta be country
Even if she's from out West
A smack right in the middle of the GPS
And I love a hot Southerness
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country

[Verse 2:]
She likes Kings of Leon and Drake
And every summer she's on the lake
Oh, somebody's boat gettin' tanned up
In an Instagram pic holdin' up the tan up
Cold beverage, no, don't stress it
Gotta give her all or she'll learn you your lesson
This ain't bye bye, she can be from Hawaii
Or Tennessee or anywhere in between
She's a country boy's dream in a two piece
Becomes a once piece when shes has a few drinks
But don't get no disrespect for that idea
That country girl will leave you laying right there

[Hook]
It don't matter if she's from up-top
Listens to rock-and-roll or hip-hop
And it's cool if she's smokin' hot
But hey, she betta be country
Even if she's from out West
A smack right in the middle of the GPS
And I love a hot Southerness
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country

[Bridge]
I see the beauty in everyone, man
But it ain't nuttin' like a country woman
I know country ain't known in southern
The whole world is covered
Beautiful daughters and working folks
That raise them right whether rich of broke
And I got mad, but I really hope
You can find you one of those, let's go

[Hook]
It don't matter if she's from up-top
Listens to rock-and-roll or hip-hop
And it's cool if she's smokin' hot
But hey, she betta be country
Even if she's from out West
A smack right in the middle of the GPS
And I love a hot Southerness
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
But shit, she betta be country
She better be country
