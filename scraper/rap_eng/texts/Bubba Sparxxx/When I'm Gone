[Chorus]
When I'm gone, play my song
And spread my ashes over rocky top, yeah
A little Merle and some George Jones
And make sure that the party down here never stops
When I'm gone just carry on
Like I never left you, when I'm gone just carry on
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song

[Verse 1: [?]]
Nothin' lasts forever (Nah) this life is temporary (Yeah)
And images of bein' missin' doesn't seem scary (Uh uh)
I know the Lord above me, has a mansion for me
To meet the ones who left before me, hold our hands is glory (Hallelujah)
I know you can't touch me, but please don't ignore me
I'll be watchin' over you and I'm recordin' every story
So you can play it in slow mo when you get here
Pass around with the ol' bros we in here
Yeah just play some Merle for the good times
And tell my kids and my girl this is your time
To be thankful for everyday I was lended to ya
I never think for a minute I was given to ya

[Chorus]
When I'm gone, play my song
And spread my ashes over rocky top, yeah
A little Merle and some George Jones
And make sure that the party down here never stops
When I'm gone just carry on
Like I never left you, when I'm gone just carry on
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song

[Verse 2: [?]]
He started off as a young man with a heart full of gold
A pure soul but somewhere down the line he lost control (Why?)
And I don't know maybe his struggle seemed never endin' (Yeah)
We all experience but only full comprehend it
You go through it to get to it that's what the business is
The difference is no matter what you finish it
Treat it as innocence except for jail sentences
A phone for when he's gone is all we have in his remembrance (Yo)
A couple more nights, would have been nice
We all told him he was skatin' on thin ice
A black suite with the pin stripes it has to be (Yeah)
That's what he wanted, I know, 'cause that was me

[Chorus]
When I'm gone, play my song
And spread my ashes over rocky top, yeah
A little Merle and some George Jones
And make sure that the party down here never stops
When I'm gone just carry on
Like I never left you, when I'm gone just carry on
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song
Just make sure you play my song

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
I don't wanna cry (Yeah), but I don't wanna lie neither (Nah)
And tell you that I never cried a thousand I'll keep it
Ad let you know what adulterated I suffered through (I suffered)
Some heart breaks even handed out a couple too (Baby)
And if it was to you I'm truthfully apologetic (I'm sorry)
You can't accept it then God bless you if not forget it (Forget it)
'Cause I'm just tryin' to sweep my side of the street (You know)
A great man's buried deep down inside me that needs
To surface before the circus is tent poles
And maybe it's been folded the cold as the wind blows
As they still doin' time and yesterday's wine
Try's his best to remind you of Bubba K's time, yeah

[Chorus: [?] Bubba Sparxxx]
When I'm gone, play my song
And spread my ashes over rocky top, yeah
A little Merle and some George Jones
And make sure that the party down here never stops (Hey possum)
When I'm gone just carry on (You know he's asking like)
Like I never left you, when I'm gone just carry on (Whose gon' fill their shoes)
(But right about now we ask you the same thing, whose gonna fill your shoes, 'cause we don't know)
Just make sure you play my song
(Rest in peace George Jones, gone but never forgotton)
Just make sure you play my song
