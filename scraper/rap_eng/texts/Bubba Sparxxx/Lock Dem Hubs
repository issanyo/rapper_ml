(2, 3, 4)

[Chorus]
Lock dem hubs, buckle up
Crank them subs way up loud
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
And here I go, here I, here I go
Here I, here I go
Baby, watch me roll

[Verse 1]
Watch me roll down a very dirty road
In a muddy Chevrolet, baby, you already know
That I'm country boy cool with a legendary flow
And I could turn down, it ain't necessary though
So, I'ma elevate the noise
And drink a case of Miller just to celebrate the joys
Of knowin' that they really hate the boy
'Cause it feels so great when you can tell that they annoyed
Poise, that's what I maintain
When I lock dem hubs and accelerate thangs
What thang? Any dang thang, mayne
Still watch me roll through LaGrange, can't change
Ain't that just so Bubba K?
Been drinking since 11:30, what a day
And them subs cranked up so loud
That right about now, my eardrums wanna run away

[Chorus]
Lock dem hubs, buckle up
Crank them subs way up loud
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
And here I go, here I, here I go
Here I, here I go
Baby, watch me roll

[Verse 2]
We havin' us a party in the wilderness
You better lock dem hubs if you wanna chill with us
Or them trails might be hard for you to navigate
Lost city slickers make coyotes salivate
Naw, dawg, I'm just giving you a hard time
Ain't nothin' going down but a jar of 'shine
And these country girls 'round here are fine
But don't worry 'bout her 'cause she all mine
I wouldn't take a million dollars for her
Wouldn't give a nickel for nothin' just like her
She's so thorough and she's so crazy
You'd rather lock up with a Bengal tiger
Now watch us roll outta control
Don't contemplate much, we just go
Crank them subs up, let 'em unload
Making love, doing 80 on a dirt road

[Chorus]
Lock dem hubs, buckle up
Crank them subs way up loud
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
And here I go, here I, here I go
Here I, here I go
Baby, watch me roll

[Bridge]
I got my hubs locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked
Now watch me roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
I got my hubs locked, locked, locked, locked, locked, locked
Now watch me roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, baby

[Chorus]
Lock dem hubs, buckle up
Crank them subs way up loud
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
And here I go, here I, here I go
Here I, here I go
Lock dem hubs, buckle up
Crank them subs way up loud
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
Now watch me roll, lock them hubs
Buckle up, crank them subs
And here I go, here I, here I go
Here I, here I go
Baby, watch me roll
Hahahahaha
