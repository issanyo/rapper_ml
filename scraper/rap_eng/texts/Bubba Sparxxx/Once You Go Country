[Verse 1]
Red [?] caught my eyes
It tore round that  turn and [?]
She blew through a stop sign
Put it in park and stepped outside
Of a German car with Jersey Plates
Comin' on down to UGA
Pretty girl on daddy's dime
Away from home for the very first time
She looked good, high class
Designer shoes with a little black dress
Boots and jeans are more my style
But she had legs like a country mile
She wore the city on the sleeve of her shirt
I shot a crooked grin and I told her

[Chorus]
It won't be long before you believe
You're a lot better down south with me
Getting' it on underneath the pines
All lit up by the moonshine
I ain't tryin' to hide it we get down like that
Once you go country
You don't go back

[Verse 2]
Yeah she looked at me
Real [?]
Said honey if you really want to get to me
I'll have to see a finer side
Candle light and white wine
I smiled at her a little bit more
Said girl this ain't no Jersey shore
Come with me let's take a tour
Took her hand lead her through the door
Of this dive bar on Clayton street
Ordered up two rounds of Beam
She was dam hot takin' that shot
She looked at me and our eyes locked
I saw the city slippin' off of her shirt
I saw the crooked grin and I told her

[Chorus]
It won't be long before you believe
You're a lot better down south with me
Getting' it on underneath the pines
All lit up by the moonshine
I ain't tryin' to hide it we get down like that
Once you go country
You don't go back yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
It ain't no turning back baby
You passed the point of N.O
Return you know how we roll
Them rowdy down south people
You're wasting time at Kinkos
'cause they can't replicate us
Hard times don't ever state us
Keep your faith in your creator
We're celebrators
On saturday night when the dogs bite
A victory and some Miller Lite
And I'm alright
See you gon' learn today girl
This is where you supposed to be at
Down here where we at
It's clear as day I hope you see that

[Chorus]
It won't be long before you believe
You're a lot better down south with me
Getting' it on underneath the pines
And all lit up by the moonshine
I ain't tryin' to hide it we get down like that
Once you go country
You don't go back
No you don't go back
