[Intro]
We don't give a damn
We just getting naked wasted
Bud Light in our hands, are we gonna stop, haha
(Smash, gun)
Haha, we're crazy for this one Frenchy
Here we go, go

[Verse 1: Redneck Social Club]
I'm a dirty redneck, I was born to be
Hell I didn't choose the country, the country chose me
Drink in my hand and pistol in the other
People say damn, you sly motherfucker
I get smashed, you get drunk
Growin' so hot, with the keg in the trunk
We're three beers deep, no swerve on yet
Got the banjo bumpin', make the pussy get

[Chorus]
We don't give a damn
We just getting naked wasted
Bud Light in our hands, are we gonna stop, stop (oh)
From the hollar to the stage
We'll be gettin' naked wasted
Pass it 'round again, (Bubba's born) are we gonna stop (on a red sea)
Getting naked wasted

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm just lookin' for a Betty with boots on
And nothin' else I'm gon' provide her with a new home
Fireballs, JÃ¤gerbombs, and Bud Light
It's whats for dinner every motherfuckin' night (every night)
Damn right do it right or not at all
The RSC and Bubba Sparxxx holla dog
We have a ball naked bodies and alcohol
What a song man even your momma sing along (momma)

[Chorus]
We don't give a damn
We just getting naked wasted
Bud Light in our hands, are we gonna stop, stop
From the hollar to the stage
We'll be getting naked wasted
Pass it 'round again, are we gonna stop
Getting naked

[Bridge]
Dirty Redneck
I'm a Dirty Redneck

[Chorus]
We don't give a damn
We just getting naked wasted
Bud light in our hands, are we gonna stop (tell 'em fool)
From the hollar to the stage
We'll be getting naked wasted
Pass it 'round again, are we gonna stop (here to say what)

We don't give a damn
We just getting naked wasted
Bud light in our hands, are we gonna stop, stop (oh)
From the hollar to the stage
We'll be getting naked wasted
Pass it 'round again, are we gonna stop
Getting naked wasted

[Outro]
Now that's what's up
