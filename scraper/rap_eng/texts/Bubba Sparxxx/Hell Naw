[Intro]
No uh-hu

Hell naw
We've been doing it the same way for years

[Chorus]
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
They can have it when they pryin' it out of my dyin' hands (hands)
I ain't no activist but I promise you I'm a man (man)
When you fall for anything when you decide to stand (stand)
For what you believe this America not Iran
And I believe in God I believe in the constitution (yep)
They playin' mind games but ol' Bubba they not confusin' (nope)
My daddy whooped me and it wasn't no child abuse
'Cause see I know he loved me and the message he got it through (ooh)
It's called discipline turned me into a gentlemen (yea)
But if they try to rob me it'll be the end of 'em (whoo)
I got my bible my rifle right here beside me
Talk to God nightly so my survival is likely (yeah)
Hey

[Chorus]
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw

[Verse 2: D-Thrash]
Everyday they try and take something away (damn)
God freedom and guns here it's gonna stay man
It's always some kind of excuse
Tryin' not to offend certain people that they choose (shit)
But what about offending me (yep)
'Cause it's clear when I talk they don't want to hear (nah)
They don't really care about what I believe (uh uh)
They just want to plant their seeds full of greed (greed)
Hoping folks like me will just go away (yeah)
They try to hit the mute button so I won't say (hah)
How everybody feels out around my way (yeah)
But I can promise you it's gonna change one day
One day

[Chorus]
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw

[Bridge]
You know they want to take the prayer out of schools
But then they want to give you a Bible when you in prison
Don't you think that's a little bass ackwards right there
You know

[Chorus]
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw
They talkin' bout takin' my guns, hell naw
They say you aught be spankin' your son, hell naw
They're takin' prayer out of the schools I'm tellin' y'all
I ain't goin' for it nope, hell naw
