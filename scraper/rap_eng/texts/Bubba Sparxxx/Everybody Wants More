[Spoken Intro]
You know uh now I was always taught growin' up that you treat people the right way
And you know uh that's just how I ways do it
You know and uh always try to help people out and do things for 'em
And you know throughout this life I do things for people and it still ain't enough you know
And at the end of the day you know it's not what I done for 'em
But it's, it's what I still do for 'em and, and they just
Everybody ends up wantin' more you know always

[Verse 1: D-Thrash]
I was there for them when no one else was
Held out my hand come on and ride with us
Paid for the ride and put them on a hit song
Laid out the carpet and [?] up thousands of my own
But what do I get a simple thank you
Hell naw it's become a bigger issue
They had the nerve to tell me I should thank them
When I'm the one shinin' while their light is dim
I remember when we first hooked up
They were down on their luck I started payin' 'em bucks haha
But I could see it comin' yeah it was real clear
I started being second choice to a case of beer
And everything I did the years that I spent (yeah)
The contacts that they met through my business (that's right)
All the hard work that they benefited from
A sincere thank you I never got one
No, no

[Chorus]
I've done what I can 'cause that's just who I am
But no matter what I do everybody wants more
I gave everything and only kept my name
And now I've got nothing and everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
(man man man) everybody wants more (unbelievable)

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
There's a lot of Bubba there's even more Andy
And if you're walkin' with me you can sure have me
But when Bubba's depleted and Andy feels defeated
I need up energy now your memory is deleted
I tried to help them all my love is un-dying (dying)
But when the glass shattered (shattered) the only one trying
To pick up the pieces before that feeling leaves us
Is the same one you hate because of no real reason (damn)
I won't apologize for workin' 80 hours
To put me in position but still I made it out less
Yeah they was dead when my rent takes precedence
Over there shit I know it's unsettling (whoa)
You are dependent on another man (man)
You shouldn't hate me for it I thought we was brothers damn
I guess we just really acquaintances unless
Everybody wants more but there ain't no more left
No

[Chorus]
I've done what I can 'cause that's just who I am
But no matter what I do everybody wants more
I gave everything and only kept my name
And now I've got nothing and everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
Everybody wants more everybody wants more
Everybody wants more
