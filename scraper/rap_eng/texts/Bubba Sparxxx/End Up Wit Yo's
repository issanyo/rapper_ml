I drop the verses y'all don't deliver
Take the chances y'all won't consider
Got a lawyer broad named Betty who
Know what to do with that chrome I give her
I'm on the shitter thinkin about
My bank account and how to make it bigger
Then I grab the tool and take your jewels
Now my watch is blue, the same as Jigga's
It a'int the liquor, I'm really sick
Smokin schwag, eating Krystal chicks
On a roller coaster with Bo and Kosher
Can't even fuck with y'all pencil dicks
A'int this some shit every time we step inside the club
Y'all trying to guess which one of us
Gonna snatch your bitch
