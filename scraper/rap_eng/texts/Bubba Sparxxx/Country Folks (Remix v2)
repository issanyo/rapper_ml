[Chorus: Danny Boone]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Country fried tongue tied them haters
Bubba K's back french fry them taters
The truck sits high but the nuts swing slow
And I'm huntin' me a muddy hole (come on)
Dirty my cubicles it's just business as usual
To y'all it's unsuitable but to us it's beautiful
Fill up the cooler and lets maneuver through Trap County
The sheriffs my buddy so we ain't worried about that mountie (no sir)
Just ask 'bout me my reputation
Is that of a good dude that really  was raised in
This here location, it really did make it
Then planted the seed for a whole generation
Yeah I'm pretty good but God is great (great)
Keep him in my heart and I'll be straight (straight)
Without him in my home I'd go crazy
Ain't nothin' like my folks baby

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 2: Lenny Cooper]
We go back like a cold one and drink plenty
Way back like some Waylon and some Conway Twitty
I come from a little town yeah it's itty bitty
Far from a city ain't nothin' change in how I'm livin'
I got a vision and that's to never stop
Back road records gonna be bumpin' out your speaker box
We got this game on lock we raisin' to the top
Country folks yeah we rock

[Verse 3: Sarah Ross]
Hangin' round the bonfire on a Saturday night
And if you want to mess around we gonna put up a fight
Us country folk we all ride together
Yeah I want this moment right now forever

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 3: [?]]
Country folk little smoke lotta beer
Pardon me I'm a Tennessee Volunteer (what's up)
Pour it up raise your drinks up high
Gotta a case of Bud Light and a jar of Apple Pie (hey)
Before we're done you can bet the sun comes up
Or the cops come then everyone runs
Work all week party on the weekends
Spend Sunday's fishin' drinkin'

[Verse 4: [?]]
Backwoods by the river in the sunshine
Not a worry on my mind tryin' wet a line
That's how we do it in the south baby all day
Work hard in the yard then we go play
Come home ta mama cookin' in the kitchen
Daddy's in his chair little whiskey sippin'
Tea's on ice fresh fried chicken
I love my life this here's livin'

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 5: Colt Ford]
See me an Bubba, we been doin' this a long while
It sure seems a lot longer than a country mile
Hollywood look good, full of fake friends
I never thought we could ever be here again
Time heals, one fell, one came up
Back together son, we gon' tear this thing up
A lot of talkers, and I ain't gotta name em’
They wanna be us, hell I can’t blame em’

[Verse 6: Kalan Miller]
We been doin' this forever now the game done changed up
But let me tell you homie we gonna tear this thing up
Bubba K Colt Ford K-Mill is danger
Just remember the name because we comein' with bangers
Average Joe in the buildin' we don't kick it with strangers
Hold it down with my day one partners they helped raise me
That's the way the mud life made me
Keep it 100 till the good lord takes me

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
Country fried, baptized in gravy
Can’t wash off what the good lord made ya
No matter how far that highway goes
An old dirt road will get you home (come on)
If you see it in their eye when they try to lie
If you the bullet hole in a stop sign kind
Then I'm right there witcha put ya drinks up high
For my country folk (hey)
My country folk (hey)

[Verse 7: Lenny Cooper]
Real talk I'd spend all my money
Just to get another spoonful of grandmama's dumplings
Sippin' a cup of Jim Beam straight like it's nothin'
What up to all my people in the country
