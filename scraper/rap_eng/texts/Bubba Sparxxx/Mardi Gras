[Intro]
Woo

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
My daddy told me if you stay ready
You ain't gotta get ready, she way ready
Been in permanent Mardi Gras mode since
February '09 took a road trip
To the French Quarter and never made it back
If you catch my drift, where the Jager at
Mix a little Red Bull with it, uh oh
She ain't thinkin' 'bout nothin' she just go
Go, go, go, go, go, she had a man but she don't no more
'Cause she couldn't hold still, she ain't gon' chill
She Mardi Gras turned up, ah yeah, woo

[Chorus: Noah Gordon & Bubba Sparxxx]
That girl so, Mardi Gras
Wild as a fox so lawdy lord
She dancin' up on the bar
Just throwin' back those Jager Bombs
She 'bout to, to take it off
Bust a chain, break down the walls
If she, keeps keepin' on
That alcohol, I swear that y'all about to head west
The hottest thing y'all ever saw
That girls so, Mardi Gras
It's like every day is Mardi Gras

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
She workin' with a whole lot of give a damn (Nope, nope)
Fall in love with her brother, you're in a jam (Yep, yep)
She's workin' with a whole lot of energy
Spend a night with her you gon' have a memory (Yeah)
She turn Mardi Gras into a adjective
Other girls talk about her she just laugh at them
On the clock 9 to 5, no daytime (Late night)
When she shine, (Oh) y'all can't shine (Naw)
So Mardi Gras, but she don't want beads
She just want to do it big or she gon' leave
So Mardi Gras, that's how she gettin' it
If it ain't about a party don't [?]

[Chorus: Noah Gordon & Bubba Sparxxx]
That girl so, Mardi Gras
Wild as a fox so lawdy lord
She dancin' up on the bar
Just throwin' back those Jager Bombs
She 'bout to, to take it off
Bust a chain, break down the walls
If she, keeps keepin' on
That alcohol, I swear that y'all about to head west
The hottest thing y'all ever saw
That girls so, Mardi Gras
It's like every day is Mardi Gras

That girl so, Mardi Gras
Wild as a fox so lawdy lord
She dancin' up on the bar
Just throwin' back those Jager Bombs
She 'bout to, to take it off
Bust a chain, break down the walls
If she, keeps keepin' on
That alcohol, I swear that y'all about to head west
The hottest thing y'all ever saw
That girls so, Mardi Gras
It's like every day is Mardi Gras
