Don, Don, Donny, I just don't know
You know, it's just, it's just too much stuff out here
I sit here and drink, my wife, she's gonna leave me
And I just don't know

Hell, you need to smack her
It's what all women need, and it's what they want
They make you do it, hell

I just don't know, I don't, I don't want to smack nobody around

I ain't telling you to smack nobody, I'm just sayin'

Well, you just said it, you just came out your mouth and told me-

Just sayin' that she wouldn't mouth off so much

It, it a'int the mouthin' off-

Who the hell is that?

Whereabouts?

Comin' up the road there, he's coming in my goddamned yard

Oh that's, let him get a little closer, I can't see who...

I'm getting my goddamned shotgun, who the fuck is-

No, hold on, hold on Donny, you always wantin' to shoot-
That's Bubba K, that's Bubba K

Bubba who?

Bubba K. He's from Athens. Boy from Athens

What the hell is wrong with him?

He's probably-

Boy!
What the fuck, he's on the goddamned porch, Wayne!

He's comin up here, lets just see what he wants

Get him the fuck off my porch!

It's okay, Bubba's cool
He's alright

Hey, hey, hey boy

(Bubba)
What's goin' on folk?

Get up, boy
Get the hell up!

Where the fuck's my car at?

Hello?
Bubba?
