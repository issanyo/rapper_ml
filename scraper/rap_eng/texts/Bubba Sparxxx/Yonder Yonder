Yonder Yonder
Come to Thunder
And they brung the lightning
Bubba tends to plunder
Like a fucking viking

I ain't from Minnesota
My name ain't Leif Erik
But I love to tear shit up
So it's cool if we compare it
And I was country money in that single wide
Just inside 'Bama
Right there where we increase the line
