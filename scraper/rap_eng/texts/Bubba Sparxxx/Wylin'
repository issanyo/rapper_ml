(Drop drop it down low)
She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin'
She'd rather go with a wild ass boy like me
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin'
(Drop drop it down low)

Here we go!

What's the good news, we're the league weed?
Them Lac boys, got 'em with me
Got a hundred bottles and some good weed
And if your boyfriend's here I think he should leave
Immediately, cause I'm wylin' you wylin' we wylin'
And there's nothin' he can do about it
Bubba K get it right on a Friday night
They can't see me dude I am out of sight
Do you really wanna hurt me baby?
Do you really wanna make me cry?
You don't love me, well guess what
I don't love you either but can we lie?
I'm in town just for this one night and I can pretty much guarantee
That if it ain't goin' down right now well this just ain't never happening

Here we go!

She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free

Watch her go when she heads to the bar
Showin' off like a brand new car
In her own mind she's a rockstar
Got all of the fellows comin' from afar
To watch baby girl shake shake that thang
Drop it down low don't break that thang
Yeah I know you like my country twang
Let me hit you off with some country game
I'm lovin' them cowboy boots
Country girl swag with them daisy dukes
Up top is a bathing suit
She downin' shots said whatcha wanna do uh
I can think of a couple scenarios
Jump in, just crank that stereo
Hit the backwoods in the four-wheel drive
Stay drunk, stay crunk, straight wylin' all night ay

She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin'
She'd rather go with a wild ass boy like me
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin' (Drop drop it down low)

She'd rather dance on the pole, act wild and drank free
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin'
She'd rather go with a wild ass boy like me
Don't give a damn cause she wylin', wylin' (Yeah drop drop it down low)

Ain't a damn thing wrong with a short lil skirt
Done lost her phone 'bout to lose her shirt
Got the whole damn club on full alert
Done drunk so much all she wanna do is flirt
Oh, with a bottle of crown
Stand up slow so you don't fall down
Do your thang to this country sound
Bubba K, Lac boys done laid it down
