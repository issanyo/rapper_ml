[Chorus: D Thrash]
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough

Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough

[Verse 1: D Thrash]
Yeah we ridin' around (hah)
Scared of heights and don’t look down
Tires makin' that sound
Sittin' 'bout six feet from the ground (Jawga)
Jawga Boyz we crusin' (haha)
If you sittin' to low you losin' (uh huh)
Don’t know about us you snoozin'
Cooler in the back keeps us boozin'
Bubba Sparxxx with us (uh huh)
And we like to park these trucks (that's right)
Shootin' in the dark we bust
Use my knife to carve these bucks (hah)
Take a ride with us (uh huh)
And learn about how we live (come on)
Learn about how we take the things we kill and make them meals
And learn about all these years (hey)
Learn about all these fears (hey)
And learn about how we get judged by the way we feel still
We just some country boys (uh huh)
In a world that don’t like us
That’s when we get away
You can find us kickin' dust

[Chorus: D Thrash]
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough

Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparkxxx]
My Chevrolet that Duramax
Got 'em askin' me why would I
Damn near put tractor tires on it dog that’s too high
Broke bro I don’t know or even care how you ride
But down here we jack 'em up
Tryna make you look when I cruise by
We dirt road rippers, Michelob sippers
That’ll get it on witcha
Right about now we fittin’ to hitta'
Mud hole by some little ol’ river
Tear it up then keep on sippin'
Graduate to shine, tryna get these women
To turn that two piece into a one piece
Everything’s lovely, yes we livin'
All I ever wanted as a lil’ boy was a big truck
A mean motor, some big ol’ tires
And never would I be getting stuck (ey)
I growed on up a lil’ money came and I got that thang
Some folks say I needta drop that thang ha ha ha

[Chorus: D Thrash]
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough

Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Ridin' in the jacked up truck
Don’t matter how high
It ain’t never high enough
