[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Hey...yay...man
I should've stuck with my buddy BUD
[?]
Still i ended up in the mud
Face down with the pigs all night
Just had to sample that apple pie (shine)
Of course i overdone it
Now i'm thinking this can't be life
Spitting just like smoke and vomit
All i remember is a bonfire
A chicken coop and some barb wire
Oh yeah and a mason jar
And i think a bar and a car ride
Maybe even my girl yelling
I kissed her sister and let her tell it
Truthfully i'm clueless
But this afternoon is pure hell and
I ain't even called into work with a lie
Plus my hands too hurt either side
Should i just quit? I mean i gotta pay the rent
Then again i'm uncertified
Oh yeah that's certainly right
Another thing i don't know just here
I'm not doing it not no more
I'm going slowmo just me and my beer

[Chorus] x2
I've done my share
Of raising hell on these dirty roads
But i swear
I ain't drinking this stuff no more
They're like yeah
You done sing us that song before
And i'm like yeah
They prolly right i already know

[Verse 2: I4NI]
It's sunday morning
I'm already on it
[?]
Last night the bottle was calling
So i had to go out and grab it
Been one week and three days
Since i had this feeling
My mind is telling me yes
But my body says you don't need it
Just one drink to get the edge off
But i know that's dead talk
Before you know it i can barely walk
Damn near lost everything i brought
But imma tell myself it's the last time
Every time to be exact
And i tell myself the same again
As i open up this fifth of jack
And just wash away tears and pain
Relive the good times
Might even call up a cup of friends
Sipping a little bit of this moonshine
Now i got a problem, i can't solve it
Don't know if really want to
If you could buy the bar and light you a star
Tell me what you gon' do?

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3: ?]
Woke up this morning like
What happened last night?
I can't remember a damn thing
And that ain't right
Started off on that [?Rye?]
Ended up on that cherry shine
Why do i keep on doing this
When this the outcome every time?
That's the facts, ain't no guessing
Seems like i would've learned my lesson
Mum was stressing, no more messing
With that shine - good suggestion
Then i wouldn't have to question
Why my vision isn't clear
Where the hell did i park my car?
How the hell did i end up here?
I get so faded, i swear i hate it
I just like when Bubba makes it
Barely shooting my little louie
Georgia peach, yeah that's my favourite
[?] bathroom floor
Swear i'm not drinking no more
Said that last week
And the past week
And the prior week before

[Chorus] x2
