[Intro]
Yeah Yeah
Colt Ford
This is the remix

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm still country, y'all, it ain't gon' ever change
I'm still a Georgia boy, I still rep La Grange
I'm still drinkin' Jim Beam and Jack D (Yup)
And that heaven dub they can't mess with bub
And I'll tell you what I'm feelin' new again
Called up Colt and Danny, like, let's do it then (Let's go)
Let's cut the race on and drink a cold beer
Tell them suckers get on, I'm in my zone here
I took my city homie snipe huntin' last night
Told 'em, "Here, hold this bag and this flashlight
And we gon' run 'em your way, just hold tight"
He never got him one but we laughed the whole night
Yeah life is great I can't complain
I entertain sing and do my thing
I just smile when haters say my name
It's Bubba K the whole remain pertain

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

[Verse 2: Danny Boone]
Welcome to our neck of the forest
City folks ain't checkin' for us
It's not Petticoat Junction
It's bug zappers on porches
It's 105 and muggy, skin scorches in the heat, it's
Chiggers and gnats and helicopter size mosquitoes
Try to eat us we need eaters we believe in Jesus
We got a deep seeded respect for those that fought to keep our freedom
We support our folks so I'm burnin' with Colt Ford Bubba and Demun
By the way I'm Danny that's
Athens La Grange Charles County jack
Don't get one in the front and out your back
My people say

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

[Verse 3: Rooster & Uncle Snap]
Slap stompin' through the country in my Red Wing Boots
I raised up in the south where I planted my roots
You know I got to throw it up for people in the back wood
Tailgate down ridin' high like a Lac should
No one ever liked a city slicker with a fat mouth
Bring it round here bet you'll get your ass knocked out
Down home boys on this song to make you feel fine
Can't tell play some Hick-Hop for me one time
Ol' Colt called me up said he needed some help
I filled my cup in the trunk now I'm flyin' like hell
I ain't ever been rehearsed I don't need no recital
This is real country talk this ain't American Idol
I made the noise for my boys they workin' so hard
The rednecks checks to checks and the trailer parks
Hick-Hop and body rock and put it up on the wall
Country folks world wide now this all for y'all

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

[Verse 4: Colt Ford]
Well looky right here it's like a family reunion
Everybody gather round and take communion
Colt and Bubba K like Snow Man and Bandit
Damnit they can't stand it just how we planned it
Lord let the water wash away our sins
Thank you for Danny Demun the Lacs and good friends
'Cause folks from the country ain't afraid of Jack
We drink him and Jim and all of that hymn
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
And if you get in my face I'm a tear of the place
And leave you layin' in the southern ground
Sing it Danny

[Chorus: Danny Boone]
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around

[Verse 5: Demun Jones]
It's about baggy jeans buckled and Georgia boots
These mud bog tires chrome 22's
'Cause we country folks raised on breakin' blocks
Always got something with the clip in the glove box
The rifles tucked behind the rear seat
If you see a buck duck my wife cooks the deer meat
It's a spectacle you should really come see this
