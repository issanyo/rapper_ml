[Intro: Bubba Sparxxx]
What up
New South

[Chorus]
It's time to take you for a ride
A place with dirt roads and apple pie
Corn fields and that baby blue sky
Pickup trucks and the beer on ice
This is what I call paradise
Livin' far from the city and the neon lights
Yeah they call me country (haha)
And I'll be this way until I die (yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Dez]
Some of them call me country they say I'm southern fried
I love it when I hear it so I tell them how much I 'blige
Yeah we steady rollin' around showin' our guests that hospitality
Music cranked loud ears losin' functionality
Got the pedal to the metal and I'm sippin' from my kettle
Bunch of folks in the back like a shuttle and they difficult to settle
Down in the woods take a listen you can hear that engine rumblin'
'erbody tryin' to catch up but they keep stumblin'
We ain't lookin' back never gonna back track or give slack
These maniacs with a buck shot in a 12 gauge in the gun rack
I'm lovin' that, and we ain't changin' from our up bringin'
Mud slingin' livin' the dream of the country and we keep singin'

[Chorus]
It's time to take you for a ride
A place with dirt roads and apple pie
Corn fields and that baby blue sky
Pickup trucks and the beer on ice
This is what I call paradise
Livin' far from the city and the neon lights
Yeah they call me country
And I'll be this way until I die

[Verse 2: D. Thrash]
All day we be ridin' around in the pines
And we ain't ever obeyed a speed limit sign
Them city folks call us rednecks that's fine
I don't mind as long as they don't cross the county line
'Round here we don't use a GPS
We give directions ('bout a mile down on your left)
And if you don't understand then you ain't from here
You ain't got no money we can take beer
That's normally how we get paid
Workin' on the farm and takin' breaks in the shade
And there's no amount of money that I would take
To change the way I would live in GA
Hey

[Chorus]
It's time to take you for a ride
A place with dirt roads and apple pie
Corn fields and that baby blue sky
Pickup trucks and the beer on ice
This is what I call paradise (paradise baby)
Livin' far from the city and the neon lights (Jawga Boyz)
Yeah they call me country (D. Thrash what up)
And I'll be this way until I die (Bubba Sparxxx)

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
The word for the day is persevere we workin' here (workin')
A down south Georgia boy for over 30 years (born and raised)
We in the field waitin' on the sun to come
We go from candy paint baby when it's done it's done (woo woo)
My rappin' friends they Mercedes Benz purchasin' (uhh)
And I just bought my paw a new Massey Ferguson
Country is as country does you think I give a damn (same)
Weather not you think I am I let the speakers jam
Tryin' to beat 'em out the box when the thunder roll
Me and Betty in the Chevy mashin' up the road (up the road)
Sunday funday I love it so
I drink a cold beer might just drink a hundred more (ruthless)

[Chorus]
It's time to take you for a ride
A place with dirt roads and apple pie
Corn fields and that baby blue sky
Pickup trucks and the beer on ice
This is what I call paradise
Livin' far from the city and the neon lights
Yeah they call me country
And I'll be this way until I die
Until I die until I die until I die until I die until I die
