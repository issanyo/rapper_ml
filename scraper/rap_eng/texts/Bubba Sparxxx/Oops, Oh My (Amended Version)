Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized, in a trance
From this body so buttery brown and tantalizing
You would have thought I needed help
From this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head, oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin at my feet, oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be

I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride, let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mine's, I got worried
I looked over to the left, a reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath

Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head, oh my, oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin at my feet, oh my, oh my
Ooh, some kind of touch caressing my legs, oh my, oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red, who could this be

So we've been tussling for a year and a half and the flame is burnin out
I'm ? you fussin, these discussions I ain't concerned about
For me being the man that I am a practice intolerance
I know the way you touch me would be a hard act to follow
It's in the best interests of you and I to just take a night off
You left by yourself, I called up Timmy, he set it right off
We started out in Logan's ended up in the Monkey drunk
Stopped by the ATM, bought the bar out and drunk it up
But in the mean time I wonder why I ain't heard of Betty
I'm tired of these steak eaters plus my new shirt is sweaty
Home around three for what I saw I was unprepared
Don't stop on my behalf, mmhmm go right ahead

I looked over to the left (mm, I was lookin so good I couldn't reject myself), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, I was feelin so good I had to touch myself), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, I was eyein my thighs butter pecan brown), oh
I looked over to the left (mm, comin out of my shirt and then my skirt came down)
