Ah shit!
I just seen a girl with a body like a stripper
Sliding down the pole makes me want to take a picture
Like ah shit
She got me like ah shit
Na na na na
Thirty six twenty four thirty sixer
Can't get any thicker
Think I need tip her
Like oh shit
She got me like ohh shit
Na na na na

Bubba K's back
You can tell em twice
And the melons sittin very nice
And your back side is legendary
And its all mine regards what shes tellin' me
Yeah I pull it out and I jumped out
Holla out new south yeah its thugged out
See its been good
But its gettin' great
Money walking everywhere yeah I'm sittin' straight
And I'm bout four lets have a toy
Do that dance do that do that dance
That's the walk
Your a classic and this is classical
Make it happen girl

[Chorus]
I just seen a girl with a body like a stripper
Sliding down the pole makes me want to take a picture
Like ah shit
She got me like ah shit
Na na na na
Thirty six twenty four thirty sixer
Can't get any thicker
Think I need tip her
Like oh shit
She got me like oh shit
Na na na na

And y'all knowin' it
Y'all hatin' it but shes lovin' it
And I'm lovin' it too

And I promise you I can do some things with you
Your thick betty but shes thicker
And I'm a have to I'm a have to I'm a have to get her

[Chorus]
My personal philosophy
Clothing is optional
Nothin' stoppin' you from doing what you like me to do
Guess what I like u to do
So lets do this
I'm me everyday who you is
Hes big boy and I'm a cut the fool
So they put a big blow
Yeah I got swag and I run this
Make a list of big things I'd a done this
And shes intrigued by the way it goes down in the big leagues
So I'm a give her more
Much more
One more two more and a encore

[Chorus]
I just seen a girl with a body like a stripper
