Ain't interested in the story
Just can't wait to be a hater
Facts ain't that important
They can fantasize something greater
They really doing you a favor
If it motivates you to go
We demonstrate it up close
They looking like they seen a ghost
I'm just vibing in the country
In Georgia next to Alabama
Ain't non of y'all gotta love me
Me and god we got it handled
Dedicate them a toast
They looking like they seen a ghost
They looking like they seen a ghost
They looking like they seen a (woo!)

[Verse 1]
I don't operate in fantasy
Wait and see it ain't a plan to me
Go right now is what it have to be
I'm way too late for moving casually
Phony people used to sadden me
Now I'm looking at'em happily
Pondering just how mad at me
Mama would be if that was me
I drink a beer and to hell with it
They forgot to put the last nail in it
Build one more and put yourself in it
Let me know if you need some help with it
Money don't do loyalty
Pretty women know hunger pains
Bible won't pay lawyer fees
Everybody don't love the same
When you win that's whats his name
Lose again there old whats his name
Can't expect no other thing
Bet we still get it (woo!)

[Verse 2]
You know the procedure
I pull up in either the Chevy or maybe the Chevrolet
Chopping them mickey's
I ran out of hickey's and Nicki's
And now I want every Desirae
Guess you could say I'ma celebrate
Everyday but you would never say
"that Bubba Mathis got caught up again
And then lost all the shit he worked hard for again"
If I told you it's the 4th of July
On Valentines Day you would know it's a lie
But someone can tell you
That they'll never fail you
And try to derail you
And want you to die, why?
Can't call it, maybe you was ballin and they saw it
Had a gaping hole in they wallet
And you ain't picking up when they callin, callin
Damn, you lookin at me like you seen a ghost (woo!)
Don't ask me what's up with no Timbaland either
We really friends but ain't enemies neither
If I was on fire and he was the fireman
Wouldn't ask him for piss from his urethra
That ain't a diss, no it's just how it is
Regardless forever, I'm brothers keeper (come on)

[Verse 3]
First step is completed
Got people believing
That he no longer is breathing
His mama wasn't grieving
She always thought Sparxxx was a heathen
The thought of him gone is relieving
The same goes for Kiki, his pops, and Big Steve
The only one possibly even
A little bit hurt is a dope peddler
Cause the calls he will not be receiving
Proceeding a couple of seasons
The second step is the legend decreed it
It's fall, all the leaves is seizing
Towards death on the trees
And the cycle forever repeated
The past is gone you can never retrieve it
It's better to leave it
Resting in peace or pieces
Cause spring brings a new breed of creature
Ghost
