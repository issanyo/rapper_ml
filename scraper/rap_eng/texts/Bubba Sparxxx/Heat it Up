[Intro]
Heat it up when this shit drop
Heat it up when this shit drop
Bubba Sparxxx, Collipark

[Hook]
Heat it up when this shit drop
In them big spots, where the players let them bottles pop
See the steam on her back when her hips pop
She get it real hot, so heat it up, girl
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there
Heat it up, get it up, keep it up there

[Verse 1]
What it is, how are things?
My phone was on silent for a minute, now it rings
If you too cool, then I'm too cool
Let's not boo-hoo, let's just do what we do
Movin' on, new song, new loan
Sometimes you can move right and still do wrong
Ain't nothin' fancy, just line up and run it
By the time you finish talkin' bout it, I'll be done done it
Collipark, Bubba Sparxxx
Do the Ying-Yang thang or anythang, I'm just a star
Ms. New Booty, thank you ma'am
Bottom broad brought me back, dawg this money changing hands
A lot this way, a little thattaway
Earn Sunday through Friday, spend on Saturday
Yeah, that's the play, get it up and keep it up there
Heat it up slowly then quickly beat it up, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it is, tell me the good news?
I got a tool in my draws that you should use
Give that thang a good bruise, beat it on up
Girl, you've been misused, heat it on up
I'm gon' show you what it was made for
Actin' like you scared and unprepared, but you ain't though
Grab your ankles, yeah, that's the angle
I'mma make a stank ho of daddy's little angel
I'm at the condo, with General Patton
Losers make excuses, winners make it happen
We can pull the rides out, give you somethin' to cry about
Give you somethin' to lie about, inspiration while you pout
We can pull the broads out, in a straight line
Yours ain't fine, fuck it, here, take mines
Dude, you way behind, get on Bubba K. time
I'm lightyears ahead, have a light beer instead, yeah

[Hook x2]
