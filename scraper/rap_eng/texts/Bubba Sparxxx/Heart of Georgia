[Chorus]
I was raised in the heart of Georgia, it seems I'm always gone
Church on Sunday, work on Monday Mama can't do no wrong (no sir)
My daddy always kept it 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone (yes he did)
No matter how long this old dog roams, I always find my way back home
Come on, come on

[Verse 1: Sparxxx]
B-U-B-B-A make I em southern GA and I can never be fake
Everything I create sounds like the peach state
An I drink so much shine I can't even see straight
We take a little bit turn it in to alot of shit that we keep it poppin with
An ain't it obvious they should build a monument
Way out in the sticks to honor my accomplishments
A son of lagrange on stage out in Idaho
Painting that southern living portrait with a microphone
Wouldn't you know I should have known Idaho is like my home
Bikers on harley d's hardly seems like I'm gone
But there ain't nothing like Georgia on a fall day
Giving that grill hell while the bulldogs play
Been all the way across this globe but my heart stays on McCosh Mill Road (come on)

[Chorus]
I was raised in the heart of Georgia, it seems I'm always gone
Church on Sunday, work on Monday Mama can't do no wrong (no sir)
My daddy always kept it 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone (yes he did)
No matter how long this old dog roams, I always find my way back home
Come on, come on

[Verse 2:]
I go to sleep Friday night an wake up Monday morning
Cause I got to get the money I gotta break bread and make the ends meat
I'm always clocking out late an getting no sleep
It's all I know, it's all I've done, it's how we do it out in the country where I'm from
Nobody ever stops, nobody ever quits
An if your talking shit about us you better get
My hand's stay dirty, but I stay clean
I try to do it right if you know what I mean
I'm getting those checks I'm paying uncle Sam
I waiting for my tax refund up in the mail
My daddy worked hard, my mama did to
They always try to make sure that I knew
Bust yo ass and never make excuses
You can do anything if you put your mind to it an do it

[Chorus]
I was raised in the heart of Georgia, it seems I'm always gone
Church on Sunday, work on Monday Mama can't do no wrong (no sir)
My daddy always kept it 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone (yes he did)
No matter how long this old dog roams, I always find my way back home
Come on, come on

[Bridge]
Were about as Georgia as the okefenokee
Were about as Georgia as hunting hound dogs
Were about as Georgia as old stone mountain
Were about as Georgia as sir man to yall
Were about as Georgia as peanut farmers
Were about as Georgia as peachtree street
Were about as Georgia as solid gold music
That's rap, yeah that's country

[Chorus]
I was raised in the heart of Georgia, it seems I'm always gone
Church on Sunday, work on Monday Mama can't do no wrong
My daddy always kept it 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone
No matter how long this old dog roams, I always find my way back home
Come on, come on
