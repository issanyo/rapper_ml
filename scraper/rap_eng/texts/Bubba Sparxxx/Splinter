The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I got a whole lot of issues that are unresolved
I went 2 weeks without seeing nobody, just my dog
His name is Blao, he's the closest thing to a child
I may ever have, I’m selfish as hell, why lie
Too self absorbed of relationships, still I try
From time to time to find me one for my life
And my patterns are hard for a decent woman to
Respect or accept, so whores I keep em' comin through
In the bed with a babbling bitch that loves me
And she bad it’s just some about it’s ugly
After we finish, I hate when she try to touch me
It ain’t her fault, that’s just me
I slowly weigh down, but I ain’t perfect though
Relapse is a record that I done heard before
And I’m no Marshall Mathers, I’m talking Andy Mathis
I’m talking deadly habits, it’s so sad and tragic

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I tried my best to be so good to some folks
The same people showed me betrayal up close
The flip side of that coin is I’ve been negligent
With a lot of my real friends I never meant
To let a day turn into a month and then a year
Without speaking to you, I know that it appears
I just forgot about y’all but really in truth
I forgot about me too, this igloo
I built around myself it’s so frigid
And it ain’t melting away, I don’t dig it
I know life is gone, I’m gon' miss it
It’s like it never was here, if you don’t live it
I think about the past and get so livid
What the fuck was you thinking, I don’t get it
You so capable, personality magnetic
Life could have been so good if you had let it

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, don't let me lose my faith today

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
I may not be the shit to you but where I come from
Them people love Bub, therefor I must just
Stay faithful, the lord got his hands on me
And you don’t hate me, you just don’t understand, homie
There from humble beginnings I saw limitless
Possibility, fear was my only nemesis
Along the way I forfeited my innocence
But that is ok, thank you lord

For all the pain, the affliction
It’s like a mirror in my face that I need to see
All my loss, my addiction
Showed me something that I really needed to know about me
It’s like a shape to me, you’re more than me
Killing this heart is controlling me
Though I’m out of control, you still order me
Folding me up inside your hands and the words don’t come

[Hook]
The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I know I’m a sinner
But all I can do is pray, god just take the pain away
Cause I’m cold as the winter
And life done got up under my skin like a splinter
I know I’m a winner
But all I can do is pray, let me make it through the day
Let me make it through the day
