[Chorus]
Got a Chevrolet in beast mode
Out on an old dirt road, and I'm rippin' it up
Law man wasn't gonna get it
Tried to write me a little ticket, I'm rippin' it up
'Round here a handshakes what's real
You need my signature for a deal, I'm rippin' it up
Everybody has to find a way to eat
Me I'm takin' hold of this beat, and I'm rippin' it up

[Verse 1: Danny-O of the BoonDock Kingz]
I'm Danny-O from these hills and these mountains
Tryin' to keep up with this money that I'm countin'
North Georgia this clay is all in my veins
Ride the Chattahoochee to Bubba down in La Grange
I'm 'bout my business I'm guaranteed to eat
Since a knee high youngin' and runnin' with bare feet

[Verse 2: Kuntry Strong of the BoonDock Kingz]
I'm sittin' in a Chevy Impala SS
I'm a dirt road rider I'm immune to that mess
In the country yeah the woods what we say it's all good
Shake your hand like a man just like my granddaddy would
I wish you'd stay rippin' boondock'n till I'm gone
The pleasures all mine and the name is Kuntry Strong

[Chorus]
Got a Chevrolet in beast mode
Out on an old dirt road, and I'm rippin' it up
Law man wasn't gonna get it
Tried to write me a little ticket, I'm rippin' it up
'Round here a handshakes what's real
You need my signature for a deal, I'm rippin' it up
Everybody has to find a way to eat
Me I'm takin' hold of this beat, and I'm rippin' it up

[Verse 3: Porch Matthews]
Come over here girl Porch got somethin' to say to ya
You wanna take it slow or we can go hulkamania
Rippin' it up like a past due bill
I was dirt poor last month dirt poor still
Now that D. Thrash done hooked a brother up
Kids fightin' for a spot down front while I'm rippin it up
In the booth, laid a track down
Break me off a piece of that hick-hop crown
Yelawolf said it let the vets dread it
This feature is the bait let the sharks come get it
Been ripped off when times were the hardest
Pawned more six strings than a dope fiend guitarist

[Chorus]
Got a Chevrolet in beast mode
Out on an old dirt road, and I'm rippin' it up
Law man wasn't gonna get it
Tried to write me a little ticket, I'm rippin' it up
'Round here a handshakes what's real
You need my signature for a deal, I'm rippin' it up
Everybody has to find a way to eat, (Bubba K, aye aye)
Me I'm takin' hold of this beat, and I'm rippin' it up

[Verse 4: Bubba Sparxxx]
You came in it's twenty football fields
Away from us out here where the mudbog is
My city homie said "man what's y'alls deal"
I told him "we rippin' it up dog chill" (what you sayin')
The dirt road the mud hole the beat I'm on
My beers cold I'm in my zone just leave me alone
Came from nothin' aimed at money and hit it runnin'
Lived it up ripped it up like it was nothin'
Life's better now much simpler
It ain't family or God I just rip it up (rip it up)
I'm just tryin' to get enough and  hold onto it
Give a damn I'm never gone give it
Rip it

[Chorus]
Got a Chevrolet in beast mode
Out on an old dirt road, and I'm rippin' it up
Law man wasn't gonna get it
Tried to write me a little ticket, I'm rippin' it up
'Round here a handshakes what's real
You need my signature for a deal, I'm rippin' it up
Everybody has to find a way to eat
Me I'm takin' hold of this beat, and I'm rippin' it up
