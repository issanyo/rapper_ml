Nothing in particular, and I'm doin' it all day long
A hot grill and a cooler of beer
And a CD of my favorite songs, a lotta
Nothing in particular and I do it well
So much of nothing on the schedule now
And I'm invitin' all of y'all to help

[Part 4: This is our Song (Remix): Danny Boone]
Welcome to our neck of the forest, city folks ain't checkin' for us
It's not Petticoat Junction, it's bug zappers on porches
It's 105 and muggy, skin scorches in the heat, it's
Chiggers and gnats and helicopter size mosquitoes try to eat us (try to eat us, try to eat us, try to eat us, try to eat us, ha ha ha ha ha)

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
And if you don't like it then don't come around
Don't come around, don't-don't come around
Don't come around, don't-don't come around
Don't come around, don't-don't come around
Don't come around, don't-don't come around (yeah ye-yeah ye-yeah yeah)

This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it
This is our song everybody sing it
Clap your hands y'all and do it like you mean it
We stand our ground and we don't back down
If you're from a small town and you're never gonna leave it

[Part 5: Where I Come From: Montgomery Gentry]
Where I come from
There's an old plow boy out turnin' up dirt
Where I come from
There's a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
Where I come from
Where a couple boys fight in the parkin' lot
No, nobody's gonna call the cops
Where I come

Kickin' up mud in my 4 wheel drive
Big truck (big truck), big tires (big tires)

[Part 12: Back: Jake Owen, Rooster]
Back
When life was simple as that slangin' mud
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad livin' low
When this whole world had way less worries
Nobody in a hurry and back
To mama's home cookin' and dad slangin' mud
Was baitin' my hook and I'm sittin' on a tailgate
Thinkin' 'bout those days
Just wish I was back
When life was simple as that
I didn't know I'd miss it so bad
When this whole world had way less worries
Nobody in a hurry and back-back-back-back-back

[Part 13: Cold Beer: Matt Stillwell]
It all started with a cold beer
In a smokey atmosphere
A few words whispered in her ear
"Can we get on out of here?"
It was down some back road-back road-back road-back road-back road-back road

[Outro]
I think he's stuck (I think he's stuck, I think he's stuck, I think he's stuck)
