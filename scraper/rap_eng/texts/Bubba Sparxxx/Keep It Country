[Intro: Bubba Sparxxx]
Raise hell and eat cornbread, bitch
Upchurch and Bubba K bitch

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'
And I'm sippin' on a little somethin'-somethin'
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
Mama's cornbread still bumpin'
And my brother's always gettin' into somethin'
K5 full of honkies goin' muddin' (damn straight)
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country

[Verse 1: Upchurch]
Lift kits and big tits, dip and beer, though (hell naw)
Is that what these folks think I'm really here for?
Hell no, so put your eyes on me and let me tell you what I think
Take it how you want it, my opinion shouldn't make a blank (hell naw)
Hick-hop, what a word, google that term
I ain't a part of any clique or any gang or any work
I ain't no damn idiot just beggin' for acceptance (hell naw)
I'm here to tell you how I always be rebellin'
I used to put RC Cans in the wheel of my bicycle
Now I'm rolling on 35's, chill as a icicle
Yeah, I came up from nothin', now my phone is constantly buzzin'
'Cause somebody told somebody they had to come tell me something, I'll love it
I'm nothing but a Tennessee country bumpkin with Cali
Colorado, Kentucky and Alabama, bumpin', what's up (ah yeah)
Small town but I'm doin' big shit (Cheatham County)
Backwoods, got it tatted on my skin

[Chorus:  Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'
And I'm sippin' on a little somethin'-somethin'
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
Mama's cornbread still bumpin'
And my brother's always gettin' into somethin'
K5 full of honkies goin' muddin'
(You already know it, you already know it)
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country

[Verse 2: Upchurch]
Tennessee time tickin', Kentucky Fried Chicken
Buy a junky ass truck, spray paint it, with gears missin'
I'm on mission of gettin' people to listen in Dixie
And whistle to all the lyrics, the hell of a team spirit
I'm cold boy shit slick but I won't get stuck
Unregistered guns layin' in the back of the truck
Hah, to hell with everybody I could stop givin' a shit (fuck It)
My neck of the woods is known to be super thick
Th-th-thunder roll like a Tennessee hailstorm
Let the camera flashes flood you like a river bound mobile home
Cut the haters, knock me down, wallow some old bricks
I'm still a fuckin' beast comin' out of the damn sticks (ah yeah)
People used to talk me down, now they wanna call me up
Ex's wanna message me after they done drank enough
Talkin' 'bout they miss me and they never wanna cheat again
Sorry I'm too busy layin' with a Puerto Rican chick

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm going huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'
And I'm sippin' on a little somethin'-somethin'
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
Mama's cornbread still bumpin'
And my brother's always gettin' into somethin'
K5 full of honkies goin' muddin' (goin' muddin')
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
B U double B A
'Round the world 30 times still country he stay (he stay)
Out in Nashville we're stuffin' D Wade
Just up in Cheatham County to hunt for 3 days (3 days)
With Upchurch it must hurt to know (woo)
The next schedule's rockin' with the first to show (what)
These country boys know how to get get get it
Made me 20 mil but I spent spent spent it
On trucks and guns and it was fun
Never waste time or regret the shit is done (nope)
I've been known to chatter and never matter
Haters hate it when you keep goin' they never sadder
Them Mickey T's still hummin' and hummin'
And that Bubba K shit still bumpin' and sumptin'
Small towns and all around the US
We keep it country dog cause that is what we do best

[Chorus: Upchurch]
I don't listen to Drake, I'm goin' huntin'
Got them .35 Mickey T's hummin'
And I'm sippin' on a little somethin'-somethin'
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
Mama's cornbread still bumpin'
And my brother's always gettin' into somethin'
K5 full of honkies goin' muddin' (damn straight)
And I'ma keep, keep, keep, keep it country
