[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 1: Fatt Tarr of Redneck Souljers:]
Fatt Tarr on the track and we tiltin' back
We out behind the Exit Inn drinkin' beer with The Lacs
We up in Nashville ya'll better tell the haters relax
So we can get a little wild crack a bottle of Jack
But I ain't 'bout that
I just want to kick it with the women
Blow a little smoke and if they like it then I'm winnin'
To the gang up in this sta-a-a-ck they want it come and get it
'Cause we out here makin' friends we still livin' independent

[Verse 2: C-Hubb of Redneck Souljers]
Like the Declaration, that we live by
It's a celebration, let the flag fly
Bring your kids even your mama and them
Homie rubbin' the ribs
Throw 'em in the smoke
And we swim
Float in the river with friends
At it again
Somebody give me the Jim
Cali and Tennessee gettin' it in
Drinkin', eatin', yell
'Til we drunk and full as Hell man
So we'll be chillin' where the cows at
If that's a problem for you we can take it outback

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Bubba K's back
And here to be exact
Got a Betty with some back
Acting bad as she can act
And we throwin' back a few
But I ain't really keeping track
Now her man's back and I'll be easin' back
Yes, sir, he can have her
I was briefly caught up in the rapture
Now I'm back in a sorta same mind-frame
Funny thing how it happened when the time came
I was in the back drinkin' with the Bandits
And the Jawga Boyz, just like I planned it
Then she walked in, then she walked back out
Then she walked back in, look at that, "Wow"
I couldn't back down, so I stood tall
Tried to play it cool - You think I could? Naw
And just as we was headin' back to the house
Back walkin' in? Yup, there comes her spouse (I'm out)

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 4: Bird of Moonshine Bandits]
Outback where the forest is thick
There's a circle in the middle of a field, where a bonfire's lit
Cup full of shine, Copenhagen in my lip
Now I'm dippin' sideways probably wake up in a ditch
So, crank that music into the night
And crack that beer and raise it high
Stacked little blonde want a midnight ride
Take her back to the country for a real good time

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 5: Tex of Moonshine Bandits]
Got me steppin' in manure every time I spit shit
Feel like Cash in the photo with the bird gettin' flipped
Came from the bottom, so they labeled me a catfish
Worldwide better grab you an Atlas
Bonfire lit like Willy, let's smoke
Rack full ribs and a smoker full of oak
Blackberry Brandy, out back in the duck blind
Black Lab runnin', got huntin' in his bloodlines
Came from outback, but I'm back in the lead
Back like a rack full of fat double Ds
Back with a barrel on a rack let me squeeze
Back on the trigger, hit 'er right between the knees
Back with the tow strap I pull 'em real heavy
Ladies gettin' dirty outback on the Chevy
Dive-bar beauty queen, Bubba call 'em 'Betties'
Pedal to the metal, baby girl, I'm ready

[Verse 6: Demun Jones]
I sent Tex a text, and Bird called me back
He said 'We All Country', and I said, 'Yeah, that's a fact'
Well, now it's 'Rebels on the Run', time ya better pack
We 'bout to hit the road, rock shows and make a stack
I folded up my clothes, loaded up my click-clack
Grabbed a can of Beard Commander, throwed it all in a sack
I caught a fly in A-Town, landed out in Sac
The bus pulled up, it was big and it was black
That Detroit diesel was roaring like a Mac
Had chrome around the bottom, it was shiny like a plaque
I climbed on up, sat down to relax
But I heard a lot of ruckus it was coming from the back

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 7: Rooster of The Lacs]
Talkin' 'bout a burn pile, hound dog, me and my honey
We can run a game of shoes, we can lose a little money
Might talk a little smack, after sippin' that Jack
Bunch of jacked up trucks all parked 'round back
Yeah get loose, like they do it up in Cali
Ol' shine so smooth, like you cruisin' in a Caddy
Then we rolled ourself a fatty, went around to the shed
I had to back up off it, it was buzzin' my head

[Verse 8: Uncle Snap of The Lacs]
See I'm back in the Mac, I'm in the back with The Lacs
Get on these backs to the Sacs
Know how I'm hackler's act
See I'm partyin' to death, with Bacardi on my breath
I'm thinking naughty to myself about the shawty on my left
Yeah, we're still outback
It's the country outcasts
Thinkin' you can out-rap?
Yeah, bitch, I doubt that
Meet us all out back
And we'll whoop that loud ass
'Cause were bringin' country back, quicker than a snap-back

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 9: D Thrash of Jawga Boyz]
D Thrash from the Jawga Boyz
With Bubba Sparxxx and the Moonshine Bandits makin' noise
And you can find us outback, makin' shine
You want to taste-test? then get in line
Yeah, we keep the grill fired up, and I keep a camouflage mud jug
Some folks want to hate on us but
We can take it out back if you want some
Back Road ridin', with the hat back
Drink in my lap, in a brown paper sack
My cell phone won't get no service
I'm cool, but city folks get nervous
'Cause they ain't never been out here
No streetlights, and we eat deer
I'm either in the backyard or the backwoods, and I'm living good (Ha ha)

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at

[Verse 10: Brahma Bull of Moccasin Creek]
Brahma Bull, here he is, and he's buggin' on the track
We ain't talkin' thick steaks when were talkin' Outback
Naw, we're talkin' clotheslines an' some beat up cars
Yeah, we're talking tall pines in a knee-high yard
Yeah, we're talking all the things you can find out back
Grand Mammy's old swing and shotgun rack
Got the fire-pit stayin' lit, a bottle of Jack
Bubba K got drunk and made the whip go 'crack'
Fatt Tarr and C-Hubb's start shootin' it up
And the Moonshine Bandits never givin' a what
D Thrash in the back with the truck all jacked
Brahma Bull we're all country when we kick it out back

[Verse 11: Lenny Cooper]
I'm all about the beer
Yeah, I'm all about the whiskey
I'm all about makin' all these pretty girls get frisky
Don't hate a player, player hate the game
Out back in this league and we are all the same
Chasin' that dream, wantin' that fame
All these new people wanna ride on our train
Ride in on out, take it on over
Outback's where I'll be when it's all over
Outback grillin' it
Outback chillin' it
Outback workin' hard, for the little bit
Always bein' me, yeah, the Mud Digger king
With a beautiful queen my outback is my dream

[Chorus: Durwood Black]
Everything we do, we do it outback
Backyard half-charred ribs on a rack
Back-road runnin' gettin' dirty on a track
Back woods gunnin' hittin' birdies by the pack
Everywhere we go, we go to the back
Backyard bars serving jars full of batch
Back under the moon with the tailgate back
In back of the saloon where the jukebox at
