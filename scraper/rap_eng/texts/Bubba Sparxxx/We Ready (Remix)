[Verse 1: Archie Eversole]
Ain't no question bout who the best
Macy gon' lay the track and Archie come to do the rest
Step in the way, multiple shots are goin' through ya chest
You must have called Pastor Troy cause boy you is blessed
And I'mma take him out the game y'all
It ain't no thang y'all
You wanna buck, I'll rip you up like a chainsaw
The game's raw, boy please believe it
Keep your bible with you cause you gon' be needin' Jesus
Fiendin' for chart-toppin' hits
And Archie ain't gon' stop droppin' shit
I'mma make a million dollars then stand on the top of it
Rockin' it, till the day I die in this game
Archie with the Phat Boy addin' the fire to the fame

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah
Bubba baby, trouble baby dip my thang, love me, hate me
All in London yellin' Georgia, Europe better suffocate me
Hold it down for country crackers, leave them others up to Shady
Give a damn if silly sisters think I'm good enough then pay me
Tell em' Archie they don't want it, however they can get it
Told em' bout that booty chatter, y'all better go on with it
Infiltrated mainstream, maintainin' the same theme
Polo shirts and pig shit, can't even get them stains clean
Ain't too much I ain't seen in between LaGrange and Athens
Ups and downs, rights and lefts all around me brains are scratchin'
Any how we ready now, the new South has arrived
These savages is finto eat and won't stop till they satisfied
