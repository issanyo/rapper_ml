Just think about it
Just think about it

[Fred Durst]
Lately I've been skeptical
Silent when I would used to speak
Distant from all around me
Who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Fred Durst]
But you don't understand when, I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go
You and me we're through and rearranged

[Fred Durst]
It seems that you're not satisfied
There's too much on your mind
So you leave and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

[Fred Durst]
But you don't understand when, I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition I'll remember when I'm letting go
You and me we're through and rearranged
You and me we're through and rearranged

I used to couldn't catch a ride, now they eager to catch the vibe
And this ain't a teen rebellion, this shit is an act of pride
Used to come out to play, they'd tell me get back inside
Now I'm at full strength, and your reduce is magnified
I recall so clearly, Betty's I sit beside
Saying, "Andy please stop throwing others a pack of lies"
But now I'm back home she say I ain't actin' right
But after TRL I'm too stubborn to rationalize
Not like it really matters, but in a sense it does
Wasn't with me in the struggle, yet you pretend you was
And in my absence found another friend you love
Hope he place a little Bubba everytime he sends you love
And again who is he, just the newest friend you love
There's been plenty inbetween us loosie goosie in the club
But you should know me no choochie boochie in my blood
I'm with Hew Heff and Freddie groupie-groupie'ing it up

[Fred Durst]
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're cryin
Cryin on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dyin
Dyin on me

[Fred Durst]
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you

[Fred Durst]
Just think about it
You'll get it
