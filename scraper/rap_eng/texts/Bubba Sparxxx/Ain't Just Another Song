[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
A good morning can go to shit with no warning
A volcano can lie dormant a sleeping hornet
Can awake and sting as the volcano blows (blows)
Some things you can't control it's just the way it goes (yep)
I live I love I give (yes) all I got and then some why this (why)
Hatred and envy and return (what)
The biggest blessings are the lessons we learn (come on)
Y'all keep on playin' (yep) I'm gon' keep on prayin' (yep)
I'mma stay me regardless of what people sayin' (what)
They ain't stopin' nothin' (nope) and I am more than nothin' (yep)
So there's nothin' you can say to hell with your discussion (yeah)
For the mucket music is my life line
I write rhymes to save lives like mine
One song at a time can you feel it
Even if I never sell another million (let's go)

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
It ain't just another song I can feel it in my bones
So when you put it on don't you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it
It don't matter if I fail 'cause I did it for myself
You don't like it go to hell can you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it

[Verse 2: D-Thrash]
This music is all I know
I tried different things but my heart said no (um)
It was always deep down inside
Everywhere I went it was along for the ride
Can you feel that you don't have to
You can keep on tryin' to be a bad dude
And I'm gonna keep on doin' what I do
'Cause it helps me man it was never was about you (naw)
This is my life it's how I pay bills
I thank god everyday that I'm still here
And there's folks out there that can really feel
My words and pain like they right here
If I help one person one life one soul then I know
All the work that it took to get where I'm at
Will come right back yeah that's a fact (that's right)

[Chorus: Bubba Sparxxx]
It ain't just another song I can feel it in my bones
So when you put it on don't you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it
It don't matter if I fail 'cause I did it for myself
You don't like it go to hell can you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it

It ain't just another song I can feel it in my bones
So when you put it on don't you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it
It don't matter if I fail 'cause I did it for myself
You don't like it go to hell can you feel it
I really hope you feel it
Please tell me you can feel it
