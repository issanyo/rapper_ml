(Hook: KRS One)
Look into your future, what do you see?
Look into your past life, what do you see?
You could be anything you desire to be!
So what do you see, man, what do you see?

(Verse 1: KRS One)
Do you see misery or yourself in victory?
We are from the future, man, we write our own history
Life is not a mystery, it's an extension of me
Do you see liberty, or the penitentiary?
Do you see your friends or enemies, what about poverty?
I'm not inside of life, life's inside of me
It got to be my Hip Hop philosophy, that got me to the top of society's monopolies
Rock with me, copy me, hit the newer future, a loser will not be me
I'm breaking these clips off something properly
With knowledge of self, that's Hip Hop to me!

(Hook: KRS One)
Look into your future, what do you see?
Look into your past life, what do you see?
You could be anything you desire to be!
So what do you see, man, what do you see?

(Verse 2: Leaf Dog)
I treat the mic like a crystal ball, leafs are full
With no future- what they told me when I was back at school
Played it cool, did grams, until I heard the cool, fire caset with KRS teaching me the rule of Hip Hop
It made my path a lot brighter, but this dyslexic kiddie somehow turned to a writer
Time to realize nothings how it has to be, anything you desire can become a reality
We bring philosophies you ain't used to, in a Delorean, stormin' in back from the future
They're trying to confuse you like words from a MP
They want you to conform and not be free like you should be
Fuck that! Look at how far working hard's took me
Step outside the box, imagine what you could see
Or you would see if only you believed it, we only use a small part of our brain, it's no secret

(Hook: KRS One)
Look into your future, what do you see?
Look into your past life, what do you see?
You could be anything you desire to be!
So what do you see, man, what do you see?

(Verse 3: BVA)
Is this my destiny, or did I let the things in life get the best of me?
I made my own recipe, I feel the need to bless the beat
Never stress-fully, no hands out, but then I'll take whatever's left for me
Cos' every person is an unwritten book, the gaze ain't locked, you have to work to have a look
Train the mental, like I do over instrumentals
Like when I freestyle for hours with powers that's influential
Prevent you, maybe you just gotta climb a fence, dude
Change your life like those sore past events do
Even if it don't make sense, it'll clear in the future, then look back but never fear
Cos' it's a gamble, with before odds than the lottery
I've got to breathe, I've got to bring shit, I've got a lot to be
All you've got to do is open your eyes to see, that the person can always pick the apple from the tree

(Hook: KRS One)
Look into your future, what do you see?
Look into your past life, what do you see?
You could be anything you desire to be!
So what do you see, man, what do you see?

(Verse 4: Beast 1333)
When you think about your life and the path that you pursue
And are you 100% satisfied with what you do?
And do you love it, do you hate it? There's been many that have made it, many more that did not
I dedicate my life to Hip Hop, and I'm happy in the knowing that my passion is my job, I could've been a minimum wage earnin' burger flipping slob
I could've been some dead beat father with kids that miss him
Instead I became aware of my surroundings, aimed ahead of the game, I thought of the plan, began to stir and formulate my moves
Your mind should always be searching for ways for you to improve, there's no perfection, just perception of preconceptions
If your whole family's broke, you should strive to be the exception
I beseech, as I preach everything I learnt from teach, freedom of speech
My growing tentacles are further in they reach, halt to a screech
It's never too late for the bus to turn, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, as long as you learn
