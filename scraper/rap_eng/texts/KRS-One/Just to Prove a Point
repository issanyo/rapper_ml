Tell me right now, tell me what's wrong
Please tell me something before I'm gone
It seems like we have come to the end
Should I be listening to all my friends

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHIN MIGHT BE JOKIN BUT I'm THINKIN IT'S WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LET'S BE OVER AND LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

Just who do you, think I really am?
One of your mindless and stupid friends?
Why can't you simply tell me the truth?
So I can hold you, or cut you loose?

I'M NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
BUT MORE AND MORE IT'S SEEMIN THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYWAY
YOU MAKE ME THINK THAT I MUST SLEEP WITH SOMETHIN OVER MY HEAD
FOR FEAR I WAKE UP IN A POOL OF BLOOD AND PROBABLY DEAD
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING
HOW ARE WE LIVIN? HOW ARE WE LIVIN? IT SEEMS
YOU ARE NOT GIVIN WHAT YOU GAVE IN THE BEGINNING

Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?
Is it true what they say?

I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE YOU'LL BE SLEEPING CREEPING BEHIND MY BACK
YOU MIGHT BE LAUGHING MIGHT BE JOKING BUT I'm THINKING IT'S WACK
IF WE ARE OVER LET'S BE OVER AND LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT
SEE I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYMORE BECAUSE YOUR LOVE IS AN ACT
I'M NOT THE TYPE TO LISTEN TO WHAT EVERYBODY WILL SAY
BUT MORE AND MORE IT'S SEEMIN THAT I CAN'T TRUST YOU ANYWAY
YOU MAKE ME THINK THAT I MUST SLEEP WITH SOMETHIN OVER MY HEAD
FOR FEAR I WAKE UP IN A POOL OF BLOOD AND PROBABLY DEAD

Probably dead!
Probably dead
Probably dead...
