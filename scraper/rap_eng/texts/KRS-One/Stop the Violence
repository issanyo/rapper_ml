[Intro]
Worldwide!
BDP are the freshest!
Worldwide!
Worldwide!
Worldwide!

[Hook]
One two three, the crew is called BDP
And if you want to go to the tip top
Stop the violence in Hip Hop, Y-O

[Verse 1]
Time and time again, as I pick up the pen
As my thoughts emerge, these are those words
I glance at the paper to know what's going on
Someone's doing wrong, the story goes on
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
The drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
I look, but it doesn't coincide with my books
Social studies will not speak upon political crooks
It's just the presidents, and all the money they spent
All the things they invent, and how their house is so immaculate
They create missiles, my family's eating gristle
Then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
Phone calls are made, profiles are kept low
You tamper with some jobs, now the press is controlled
Not only newspapers, but every single station
You only get to hear the president is on vacation
But uh, stay calm, there's no need for alarm
You say goodbye to your mom, and you're off to Vietnam
You shoot to kill, come back and you're a veteran
But how many veterans are out there peddling?
There's no telling, cause they continue selling
As quiet as it's kept, I won't go into depth
You could talk about Nigeria, people used to laugh at ya
Now I take a look, I see USA For Africa?

[Bridge]
Huh
What's the solution, to stop all this confusion?
Rewrite the constitution, change the drug which you're using
Rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
We fight inflation, yet the president's still on vacation
BDP posse!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This might sound a little strange to you
Well here's the reason I came to you
We gotta put our heads together, and stop the violence
Cause real bad boys move in silence
When you're in a club, you come to chill out
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
That's what these other people want to see
Another race fight endlessly
You know we're being watched, you know we're being seen
Some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
But I won't drop
Not I or Scott LaRock
Well here is the message that we bring today
Hip-hop will surely decay
If we as a people don't stand up and say

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
BDP and me
We step into the party top celebrity
Say when we come in the dance, we never have to pay a fee
Cause that's cos we got R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I have this one wife, her name is Miss Melody
Although I'm from the Bronx, she from the Brooklyn posse
I tell ya a little of this and then I tell you some of that
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wear a hat
Sometimes I'm in a Mercedes and sometimes I'm in a plane
Sometimes I find myself upon the number two train
Some people look at me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself I see creativity
So if I can create, well then I make some money
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid

[Hook]
