KRS-One interview:
{If hip-hop has the ability to corrupt young minds, it also has the ability to uplift them}

Intro:
Cause I'm seein' bright visions of how we should be livin'
Unified, strong, makin' our own decisions

Verse 1:
Hip-hop city, higher minds will listen
Some won't get it and find time for dissin'
But I always been ahead of the preservation mission
So I alway's been a head of the preservation mission
And what one sure way to preserve, what we spittin', reserve what we've written
Reserve how we wigglin', preserve how we mix it, our raw sound
It's the finally established of small hip-hop resort town
A place for artist's from all over the earth
Could come and find peace, could come and spit they verse
Could find support of all sorts for arts done for fun
To achieve this, hip-hop we must become one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)

KRS Interview:
{So if we come with a balance and play everything, we will find ourselves not reflecting just product and markets, but life itself}

Verse 2:
My style of raps hard to find, I believe that every rapper has a larger mind
But they spit the sex, spit the murder, spit the crime
Cause they told if they do it they'll be livin' fine
People know it's only music, y'all don't mind
But every now-and-then I question what these rappers say and rhyme
Take yo time, I send this out to every rapper sayin rhymes, and every DJ out there playin mine
You know I don't live for the prime time
But out of all these rap names, young people should be able to find mine
Knowledge Reigning Supreme, I shine, shine like the sun
It's time for hip-hop to become one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
Woooh
Yup, come on, we must become one
UNITY! That's what it's about
Hip-Hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)

KRS Interview:
{Im crying out for balance along with a whole bunch of family around the world, they wanna to see balance.}

Verse 3:
So what I'm talkin' bout, I'm talkin' bout a plan fast
We're the richest hip-hopper's, we buy a land mass
Put out a call to see the skill that every man has
I put this on the love, that every fam has
Exodus, over da sea, we can pass
Into our own hip-hop city, turn over the sand glass
This sounds as if we just found our gift
A hip-hop town is bound to uplift
Our town has, no controls, the cops you gotta ring em up
Moms is safe, kid's you can bring em up
Just streets are patrolled by doctors and lawyers
Because you don't need law if you already have order
We are one

Hook:
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background throughout)
We must become one, you know
Hip-hop is one, woooh, hip-hop is one
Yup, come on, we must become one
UNITY! That's what it's about
Hip-hop is one
Yo, yeah, come on, we must become one
(KRS-One sample saying, "One", repeatedly in the background)
