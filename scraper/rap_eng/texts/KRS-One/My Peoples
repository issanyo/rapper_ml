[Verse One: Malik Yusef]

Just because you cats be getting left don’t mean you under the five
A severe brainstorm I came through the thunder alive
They wonder how I’ve been torn asunder survive
My flow wild hunters proof it would be a blunder to drive
While all night automatic pilot I ride as if I am kitt
Mr. Parker murdering other artists on these tracks as if he spit
My swagger force me to style as if I’m lit
I mean you seen Yusef glow
Ever since that UFO let Yusef go
Well as it were I glide when I stride
As if I had been adopted and raised by Pagasus
I’m such a fly breed
The hood cop my music before they buy weed
They love when I get open with a mic cuz I bleed
