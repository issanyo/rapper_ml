[Verse]
Fight back, shoot back, loot that, protest
Brick to the helmet, I ain't feeling no stress
Going up against the cops, I ain't wearin' no vest
The city where I come from makes your life [?]
We try to stay focused, go to school, listen
But for our school, it's just another pre-prison
The only way the people listen is when they threatened
So grab your weapon, it'll be on in a second
Class warfare, yeah, we got it all here
The poor gettin' so poor they cannot even bear
The rich gettin' so rich they cannot even share
Won't give an equal share to those that got 'em there
Label rights, pay what's right
You got the microphone today, my brother
You gotta say what's right
You know the cops work for the first class, not the rear class
So they get the protection and we get the tear gas
