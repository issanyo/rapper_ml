[Intro]

We've been friends for a long time
But Nina, you gotta go

[Hook]

Nina, you gotta go
I gotta leave you
Nina, you gotta know
That I don't need you
Nina, you gotta go
I gotta leave you
I gotta free you
Common I'ma free you

[Verse 1]

Back in the days I was fallen in love with you
I used to watch you, sit in the tub with you
We you used to cruise, you was right on my hip
I was 22, you was 22, that's it!
You fit so snug in my hand
The power, parents just don't understand
Ours [?] was a love forever
You was always ready and steady, steady and down for whatever
But your friends were 38 and others were 45
And when they was around, I'm surprised I even survived
So don't feel bad, I'm just growing up
Career blowing up, you gotta know whats up

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

When M was 16 and Glock was 9
They was there with me when I stared my rhyme
But when I started the climb and get known for rap
It seems like y'all was trying to hold me back
And not only that
You was my secret weapon, concealed weapon
We lived on the 357
Right on the corner of Smith and Wesson
When them dudes rolled up, you was the perfect blessing
But I learned my lesson, no doubt
Every time you shout
Somebodys lights in a night go out
Yo I'm out
I know what this bull [?] is about
You want me to beef all day so I could pull you out
But

[Hook x2]

In my younger days, I used to love your figure
You used to shout every time I pulled your trigger
But you're getting bigger
And your feedback is only clack clack clack
And I don't need that
Its like a speed rap, I wanna slow it down
I want intelligent, good people to come around
And they don't get down to your kind of way
See
They settle their differences in a long minded way
So in the meantime
I'm a keep trying, I worked it out
Well you can stay with Mad lion
He might have work for you
I just don't want you to ever think that I'm deserting you
But

[Hook x2]

[Outro]

If I got my Nina, then you know Iâ€™m straight trippin x3
Thats why I gotta put you down
