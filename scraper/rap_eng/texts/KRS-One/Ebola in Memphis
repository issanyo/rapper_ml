Boys shoot to thrill from the hip. This time we put the "act" in action
We've tricked the pigs into thinking that this auction is a pageant
In no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery
The livestock is star struck, they're all salivating like ravenous cartoons

Waltz around the room, with a glaze in your stare
In your tuxedo suit. I'll give it a name
(Last call, kill it)
Lower defenses, I'll lower the casket
(Last call, kill it)
Open the door, open the grave

Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Kill it, kill it

In no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery
In no time there will be makeup on our new set of cutlery

Murder. Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer
Murder. Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer
Murder. Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer
Murder. Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer

Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Kill it, kill it

[Krs one Rap]
Yeah
You slippin Duke, you trippin Duke
Rememeber you still livin in a corporate chicken coop
With a hundred other chickens yellin get that loot
Makin a hundred other chickens tryin to spit what's cute
But krs spits the fruit
My words are not hollow, I'll lead you out the chicken suit
You slippin Duke, I got proof, spit truth in the club
So the colleges man, we get so loose
What's the use, you slippin Duke, how America great
When Iraq, had no nukes, now oops
Whatever happened to samples and loops?
The same thing that happened to organs and flutes, and real artists
Thank God for The Roots, the soldier that's home with his family
Support for the troops yeah, now let's start this
I've taught many groups, been through many suits
Teachin new recruits that can't take it back to hula hoops
I know we're on mute, stand up straight
I'm like Skywalker without the loot, you slippin Duke

Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it
Kill it, kill it

Last call, kill it
Last call, kill it (Yeah)
Last call, kill it
Kill it, kill it

This is a rock and roll takeover
Living each day one night at a time
There were mercy fucks, there was blood
You should have been there by my side
(This is red handed)
Last call, kill it
