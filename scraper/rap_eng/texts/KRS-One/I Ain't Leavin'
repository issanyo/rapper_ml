[Verse 1: KRS-One]
In the hearts of the people you could see my face
Cause at any club they know how I leave the place
(How you leavin' em?) Sweaty yet ready reaching higher for more
My purpose is to inspire the poor
So I fire it raw, the others be out for fame
Yet Knowledge Reigns Supreme, that's a household name
(They is hot!) I doubt they gain
I'm true school like Kurtis, I'll blow out they flame (and they know it!)
They may say the crown, they can hold it
But when I'm in the spot, they dare not show it
Cause they're not poets, exactly that
All they rap for is lust and them platinum plaques
KRS comes after that
This that masterful emcee, I'm from a blast masterful cat
Holding a class in the back
It's obviously I mastered rap, I'm blasting 'em back

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
My whole life is different, high school I skipped it
Right around fifteen I knew that I was gifted
Self-taught home school specific
Simplistic, my characteristic holistic, a mystic
Everything to me is encrypted
Imbued with the same wind energy that be flowing from my spirit
Those that have ears to hear, hear it
There's no excuse if there's a free library and you don't go near it
Me I seek the truth, others they fear it
They living in the mansions, I'm living in the spirit
That negativity, I will clear it
That productivity, I will share it with all who will hear it
You see now that I exist and can never be told
That hip-hop was about silver and gold
With the mic I hold or held
I try to elevate beyond whatever soul or cell
Yo I sound odd but you know about that camel
That needle the rich man in the kingdom of God
Bring the real, many bring the fa√ßade
Them bells in your head, yeah I'm ringing them hard

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'

[Verse 3: Propaganda]
Operation defacement, face it
Perfect word placement chase it, wait
Catch one incident of intimate images and word
Get comfortable, a ton of bull is held at bay
Keep your ear to the street, peep footsoldier and I told you
When mixtape hit the street, it's curb and concrete
Beat beast, heat feast, don't speak, hold heat
Holy though he better let it
Better get it offer I'm taking position
Young listen
Nice as five high-speed chase to ditch cases
Cali give it three strikes, I might give you four
Bars to get it right, I check the mic in the floor
You ain't bold enough to hold enough
Flow ain't cold enough
Fool I sho nuff showed up to blow that show up
Shoulderin' a brain quicker than DSL modems
When I touch down, I raid your town

[Hook: Triune]
I live for the love of the game
I spit, I reign through the struggle and pain
Nineteen years strong been touching their brains
I ain't leavin', I ain't leavin'
