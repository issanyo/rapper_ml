The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah) don't ever stop

Never let 'em pull you down
Never let 'em lie to you
Never let 'em take your crown
Never let 'em cry to you
Never let 'em in your heart
Never let 'em give you money
Never let 'em hope you starve
Never let 'em find you funny
Never let 'em follow you
They don't need to side with you
Never let 'em ride with you
Pull out what's inside of you
Never let the system get you
Feed you, eat you, spit you out
Never let 'em know what you doin'
It's time you figure out
Never let 'em teach your kids
Never let 'em see you fear
Never let 'em blow your lid
Never let 'em take you there
Never let 'em break you up
Never let 'em break you down
Never let 'em shake you up
Never let 'em in your town
Never let a charoulette tell you what is excellent
Never let embetterment regard for what's irrelevant
Never let 'em tell you that KRS "oh, he dead, stop"
Never let 'em tell you that the radio plays Hip Hop

The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah), don't ever stop
Don't stop
Don't ever stop
Don't stop

(Hey)
Got the rhymes, borderline's rapper
I'm that other kind with tons of rhymes
Spit flames hotter than the summertime
People want to undermind but stay under mine
Under my mind under my thoughts, caught in another time
They in the past I'm in the right now
Thirty city tours these critics be like "how? Wow!"
They be tryin' to get rid of me since back in the day
But the more they push me down the higher I raise
When I did criminal minded they had something to say
When I said self-destruction they had something to say
When I did edutainment they had something to say
That's the devil I ain't concerned with nothing they say
They was frontin' in the 90's and they still frontin'
They know the cost of everything but the value of nothing
I keeps it pumpin' like a trucka
That's why I'm fresh for 2017 you sucka

The road's so cold and you better know
That you're a winner and you're going for gold
I know it's long but you beter know
(yeah), don't ever stop
Don't stop
Don't ever stop
Don't stop

Never let 'em make you doubt
Never let 'em break you
Never let 'em take you out
Never let 'em tempt you
Never let 'em employ you
Never let 'em lead you
Never let 'em boy you
Never let 'em deceive you
Never let 'a snitch or  traitor
Know what's going on
Never let 'em know the plan
Freedom's only for the strong
Never let 'em in the jam
This is how they stole our songs
Never let 'em corrupt you
KRS ONE I'm gone
