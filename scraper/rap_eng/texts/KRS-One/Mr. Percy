[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
(4 million people out of work right now!)
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(Half the youth population out of work right now!)
Give me another day
(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way
(Word up, homelessness!)
And I work (several resumes on e-mail)
And I work (CDs I'm selling my beats)
And I work (part-time at the retail)
And I work (I'm just about to be in the street)
And I work (the cars that I'm driving around)
And I work (will I ever be on my feet again?)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
Frankly I don't see how
You can't see how you really homeless now
When the emergency hits, who really holds you down?
With the state of the economy and the way that it is
Many men are at the door with they wife and they kids
Saying

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
(4 million people out of work right now!)
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(Half the youth population out of work right now!)
Give me another day
(Homelessness rising up on families!)
So I can try to find my way (Oh!)
And I work (try to drive a taxi cab)
And I work (enrolled in a technical school)
And I work (my friends, my family for a loan)
And I work (dollar cabs and carpools)
And I work (just another day now)
And I work (I'm getting paid now)
Oh, what we all gon' tell them?
Oh, we telling them this now

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Everywhere across the nation
More people are joining the homeless population
From the south to the north to the west to the east
People can't pay their mortgage or their lease
And last but not least, you better hear what I'm saying
So many men are at the door with they kids saying

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
(blow blow blow blow blow! Not getting mercy!)
Give me another day
(4 million people out of work right now! You gotta do something!)
So I can try to find my way ([?] watch this!)

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
We on the brink of revolution, you let it get too hot
So many people tryin' to hang on and just can not
They must've forgot last night's news spot
Read like a news murder plot starring who got shot
And very uplifting, just who got knocked
Very little giving, everybody's heart is locked
And they call this a civilization
Where I can't even find work with proper employment qualifications
Hip-hop is the name of my nation
Where every day is Saturday and twelve months is vacation
Peace love unity having fun
You can tell by now I'm not the average one

[Verse 4: Triune]
Get choked for the dough, get stabbed for the stash
My actions brash, I rap for grabbing the cash
They search for the blacklist faces
So no need checking your ethnicity on applications
High class for the green
How the fuck I make thirty grand a year with Dukes holding a Master's degree?
It makes no sense so I make those cents
Using my mind and using a nine, break bread
The move not orderly until those political figures meet a nigga over Martin Normandy
'Til then a nigga gon' count his stacks
Shoot craps and crack niggas for countless acts
This a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm Triuno, some call me a great one
Until Bush knee deep in my community
I'm hustling for mine 'til I get an opportunity

[Hook: KRS-One]
Have mercy, Mr. Percy
Can't find a cent to pay my rent
Give me another day
So I can try to find my way
