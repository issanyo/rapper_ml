[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
I got twenty-five cans in my knapsack
Crossin’ out the wick-wack
Puttin up my name with a fat cap
Suckers that want to be in my face, I smack that
Big respect to Artifacts
Fat Joey Crack and Mack
And Bio, and Brim, come again
With B.G. 183, recognize me
I’m a fiend… for the spray paint
Laugh if you wanna, I don’t really care if you ain’t
Cuz you don’t know me, and I don’t know you
But I do know Cope2, he hittin’ walls too
It’s the underground community of what we call writers
Worldwide burners gettin’ hotter, gettin’ brighter
Whattup Nicer, whattup Nasa, whattup Chino
Masta Ace in the place with the bass
You know we know
My man Rican, my man Zorro, taught me how to draw
In the yards of the 5 train and the 4
So when I'm on tour I rep that hardcore
I'm taggin’ up your black-book sure
I'm out for fame

[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
Bombin’, taggin’, black-book braggin’
Throw ups, pieces, aerosol all graphin’
Takin’ my space in this place, I ain’t askin’
Art is a passion, something you can’t cash-in
Back in the past, when we made our own fashion
Aerosol art—it revealed what we imagined
When “The Back” was the crew, on the buckle was the name
Bubble letters, other letters, wild style, out for fame
On the highway, taggin’ it my way
Hittin’ up the freight trains as they go by me
Never the cop-ay, somebody stop me!
I’m hittin’ up everything, hope the cameras don’t spot me

[Chorus (Turntablism): KOF & KRS-One]
W-Welcome to the—my life—
Be respect—be respect—be respect—
Out for fame (Yeah)
Everybody knew my style
I’m a fiend, recognize me
Out for fame (Yeah)
