[Verse 1: Rakaa Iriscience]
Since the serpent and the apple in the Garden of Eden
Earth to satisfy man’s need, not greed
Ignoring direct orders, forbidden but still eaten
Mankind getting pulled over for speedin’
Sunset, pollution brings a beautiful haze
Rich red waves, orange lavender fades
Breathtaking in a number of ways
Real hip display, kids struggle to play
They manufacture as long as the haves grab it
Have-nots want it as long as the haves have it
Read the product codes on bags made of plastic
Mountains thrown away like trashcans are magic
It takes a lot for the boss to feel the loss
Smoke billowing, chariots expelling exhaust
Into the sky, deep, now peep the new heat
Smog looks like fog rolling in on the street
Now breathe

[Hook: KRS-ONE]
Understand that I am the breeze and the trees
Oceans and seas

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
Truth is inconvenient at times, nonetheless
When I call it how I see it it rhymes, I’m one of the best
Greenhouse conspiracies, Exxon secrets
Icecaps melting, oceans swelling
Voices conflict but they clearly yelling
But I don’t buy the climate or the fear they selling
Reality is scary enough, easing the plane down
Out of baby blue skies into L.A., gray-brown
You, feels like it’s you against billions
I know, homies trip ‘cause you mad at oil spills
The furs, the baby seals, how big business kills
That we don’t inherit Earth, we borrow it from our children
The whole system is outta order
Chickens coming home to roost, clucking round the corner
Real power we can give to our sons and daughters
Is the knowledge of the power of the wind, sun, and water
Now breathe

[Hook]

[Verse 3: KRS-One]
Understand that I am the breeze and the trees
Oceans and seas
I’m floatin’ with ease with the dopest MCs
When I spit entertaining cats don’t want to leave
‘Cause locks are not just opened up with keys
What you know, you perceive
It’s dope what I wrote and nope it don’t freeze
In fact it heats up, so let’s bring the streets up
Makin’ ‘em weep up
Look, the brain and the mind are not the same
Why blame your true natures, your true name
Life is a game and the way you play it
Starts with your own name and the way you say it
How do you see you? How would you be you?
I’m KRS-One with my Dilated Peoples
This how the streets do, teach you
People died so we could do what we do, man
Now breathe
