As long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talkin bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

But the second I start with the state of the economy
Black leadership, Black gods and Black sovereignty
That's when you can't seem to follow me, confusion
You feel like you losin, I'm no longer amusin
This song's about choosin, choosin why you cruisin
Either Black entertainment or the Black Revolution
People love to see a young Black man rap
Until he wakes up and realize he's caught in the trap

So as long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talking bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

But the minute I get in it bout the way these rappers spit it
The minute I start spittin that truth here comes a critic
I freestyle off the top like removin ya yankee fitted
But they not really checkin for skills, they want the gimmick
Many of the challenges we face, we could solve em
But there's no trust, no unity, and that's the problem
Black people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
White people fightin amongst themselves that's the problem
US foreign policy is simply just bomb em
Rebels against they own government, the US arms em
Then when things get outta hand, yeah they try to calm em
More money, more diplomacy, just charm em
If that doesn't work then they move to "Osama"
Turn him into a terrorist, so they can disarm em
Through the corporate media, we don't stand a chance
But too many people wanna us to just stand and dance

So as long as I'm dancin
Actin or rappin
Walkin around like
I don't know what's happenin
You like me (x4)

If I'm talking bout drinkin
And nothin bout thinkin
As long as I'm high
And I never ask why
You like me (x4)

You like me, you like me, you like me
You like me, you like me, you like me
