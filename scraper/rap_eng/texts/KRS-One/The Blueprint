The blueprint!

[Verse 1]
Musty, fusty, yet so crystal clear
The non-commercial set is now here
Brought to you by the will of positive people
K-R-S plus One equals
Slammin' lyrics and beats unquestionable
The professional while I guess that you'll
Grab the album that rocks the most on the market
Strong hearted with a target
--Bloo-- and the target is hit
I shot the lyric then reload the clip
--Bloo-- another shell hits the ground
Along with the shell my opponents weak crown
--Bloo Bloo-- the title comes after
What a disaster listen to the laughter
Your heart I capture
Cause every lecture has texture
If you're wack I say "next, sir"
Who's next cause I've got no time for weakness
Only the teacher speaks this
Dialect, that gains 'nuff resect
Which money can't buy you yet
I don't care cause Boogie Down Productions has both
The most worldwide coast to coast
We didn't do it with the soft commercial sound
Try the ghetto, cause I refuse to let go
You see you don't understand I knew it
You got a copy I read from the blueprint

[Verse 2]
Keepin' it on track
And never wack
Please step back
If you speak the wack rap
Cause I alone can dis your whole pack or posse
Stupid sit there and watch me
You can't stop the original with a copy
Sloppy very sloppy you slouch
Every time you bite I yell ouch
Breakout get lost your throat is hoarse
You lost cause I'm dope of course
--One and Two and Three and Four--
But that comes from years of practice
Anti-slackness anti-wackness
Throw on the glasses and teach the masses
Very simple the question I ask is
How many MCs must get stomped
Before somebody says Kris has no comp?
Thousands, both here and overseas
If you're soft I say "please, leave"
Here's the door, here's your hat coat and mitt
Cause here we read from the blueprint
