Where the real at!
Where the real at!
Yeah!

[KRS-one]
Yo
Where I come from gats bust for nothin'
Thugs, ministers, cops, teachers, all be hustlin'
Your family's the only one ya trustin'
Clubs be jumpin', redesigned cars be bumpin'
Now there's ranks supreme KRS is a free man
In Hip-Hop culture, I'm like Allen Greenspan
I tell the culture what's hot and what's not
Now look who's on top and look whose shit just dropped
We ain't about sellin' records, we ain't music merchants
We emcees we go straight to the club and hurt shit

Down to the spot this is real Hip-Hop
Join this movement; them other cats steal a lot
You can feel the knowledge of self or feel this Glock
I'm authentic, KRS I'm really hot
Yo, what up Fat Joe that's my nigga for life
Remember when Pun fell off the stage, right on my wife
In the Bronx, we all laugh about it today
What up Freddie Fox, 2 Glocks, Pik and Spay
Dr.Dre all day, both of them
Dr.Dre with Ed Lover and the one with Eminem
This a movement, all over the world we reach
I can prove it, all over the world I teach
You hear that Dr.King, "I Have A Dream" speech a lot
But no where is it manifested but in Hip-Hop
While them other cats be lookin' for a radio song
I'm in Washington Heights, puttin' them Dominicans on
You can feel it I'm strong, I last longer lets do it
You want the real Hip-Hop well join this movement
We ain't about sellin' records, we ain't music merchants
We emcees we go to the club and straight hurt shit
