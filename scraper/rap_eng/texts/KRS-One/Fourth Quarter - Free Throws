[Intro: KRS-One]
Yeah, listen to the lyric. Here we go!

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end -
Not the world - but the age is ending. (ending)
Listen to the astrological message I'm sending (I'm sending) (Tell 'em.)
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me:
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God changes his house and
Enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically;
The New Testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God - no lie -
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun that hangs on the cross of the Zodiac
The Zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time: two thousand years and that's a fact -
It's called an age or a house in the Zodiac
The twelve disciples are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish on dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer, (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius, (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
And creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)
Do you wanna go higher...
