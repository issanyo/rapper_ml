[Verse 1]
Why these people always gotta front
Why people can't be real from the jump
I'mma be blunt so inhale it
My flow is like the ocean, I sail it
Metaphoric oceanic flow, run it
Like the ocean I'mma stay current
From the first time I rhyme they spun it
Any MC test BDP sound we a bun it
They just begun it, we the veteran
Better than any of them and we keep it 100
I'm the blast master but faster
I'm the same that influenced the game I'm named after
Hip-hop - don't fight the hunch, spike the punch
Take it back to the Castor Bunch
I'm having these rappers for lunch
I'm giving their captain a crunch
Munch, crunch, hunch up
You feeling KRS, put your ones up
