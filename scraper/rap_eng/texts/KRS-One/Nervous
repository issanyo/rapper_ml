And now.. it's TIME.. to GET {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
BDP is in full and total effect
I'm gonna shout out a couple of names
We're gonna do it like this
DJ Doc.. Manager Moe.. Ms. Melodie.. I.C.U., McBoo
{NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
D-Nice.. Scott LaRock.. KRS-One, I think that's me
And you know what? I'm down with BDP
{NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
So right about this time
You should throw your hands up in the air
How many people got Nike's on?
If you got your Nike's on, put your feet up in the air
If you don't got Nike's on
I think you need to keep your feet down
Cause the party is live {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
And we're in total stereo, yaknowhatI'msayin?

So all the suckers out there that wanna test
It's time to get {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
And at this point, we gettin a little stupid
I'd like to say, DJ Doc is in the back chillin out
On the 48-track board without a doubt
Break it down Doc, like this! {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
I'd like to give a shout out to who? Big Daddy Kane
Heavy D, and Eric B
Melody, D-Square {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
So just throw your hands in the air
Just throw your hands in the air
KRS-One is here without a care
And I don't have NO fears homeboy
So all the suckers out there that wanna test BDP
It's time to get {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
Now, here's what we do on the 48-track board
We look around for the best possible break
And once we find it, we just BREAK..
.. or, we just BREAK {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
There's two ways to do this, you see what I'm sayin?
If you feel the board, you feel around
We got tracks one to track 48
We find track seven, and break it down!
{NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
Okay.. this album has been funded
By the Blastmaster KRS-One Fund
Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!
You know what? We're gettin {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
Okay, we gon' play a little game, break it down Doc
Like this, or like THIS
{NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}

You know what? I used to be a graffiti artist
I used to write KRS-One all over the place
All up in Soundview, in Brooklyn
Then when the cops come for you, ha ha hah
You just get {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
And another thing:
Me and my crew, we made hit records all over the place
But we left B-Boy Records
And you know what happened after that point?
Ha hah, they just got {NERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}
