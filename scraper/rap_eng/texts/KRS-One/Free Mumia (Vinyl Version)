[Intro]
Knowledge, where the people at?
Free Mumia!
Channel Live! (KRS-One)
Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!
Free Mumia!

[KRS-One]
Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin' about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin, but the conversation ain't goin' nowhere
You can't diss hip hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, well listen up sista

[Verse 1: Hakim, KRS-One, Tuffy]
I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, "You're a gangster"
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
You'll have money cause I hear you get stars
She said, "Where you from?"
I said, "I was born up in the South Bronx
But now I reside across America"
She said: "You the one who be causing all that mass hysteria

Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge, ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love

She said, "I like it, that's why I jock it"
Then I said: "You only on my dick because I fill brotha's pockets
Cut the bullshit, take me to your pad"
She said: "Im'a give you the ass because I like the way your pants sag"
Spread the legs with the other hand she threw the kitty
Then I sprayed jizm like graffiti on her titties
Freestyled all night, no doubt
That bitch couldn't get enough cause she was strung the fuck out

[Chorus: KRS-One] x2
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia

[Verse 2: Tuffy, KRS-One, Hakim]
Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the Final
Call, as I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, hit that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin' cannons that phat
Because he censored the uses of the metaphor
You can get the tip of my dick Gore
Because it's you that brings the real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin', cut from the poor

Why sure! Back before we were born, they sold us out
Yeah, J. Jackson, we know what you about
Back when you was running for the presidencey and competing
All rap was dope, you loved every beat and
But you took the beating
You was using us then, like you're using us now
In the National Urban League, I don't know how
You figure the Stop the Violence Movement gave you six hundred thousand, nigga
And now you quicker to diss, I get with miss Tucker
You better find another you sell-out motherfuckers

Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggas are full of shit, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension
You paint the picture, it's the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim, that voice from the East

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3: KRS-One, Hakim, Tuffy]
Buck-buck! Buck-buck-buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the cluck of a chicken, definition is what you're missin' and
Listen to your children instead of dissin' em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the younger
Like they be sayin', "Want to", but we be sayin', "Wanna"
They gettin' dumber every summer, as they walk the road
Mainly because they cannot understand the code

In actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
Always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
Or degrees full circle, dead from the purple
Rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins is the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm Audi hundred forty four thousand with my people

From Caligula to Hitler, and now it's Schwarzenegger
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
The rock cock back the Glock cause I don't trust
The Devil, I rebel until Babylon is dust

[Chorus] x2
