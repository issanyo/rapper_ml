[KRS-One]
Yeah, turn my voice up
Yeah, you make the base bump, you know that
Yo Foxxx, what up man? You killed it on this shit

Listen to the track, this goes back
Stripped down, cats don't get down like this
But true revolutionaries get down like this
Street activists be surrounding Kris
I gets down, I don't just pound my fist
Greedy executives, y'all can like drown in piss
Cause raw Hip Hop, man it sounds like this
I got pounds of this, I spit rounds of this
Man pass me the mic, I go to town on this
Walk out with a cap and gown on Kris
Cause I graduate, man I'm glad they hate this
I float cause I never hesitate, I'm wait-less
Some of y'all can't take this
I'm like the ocean, you what a lake is
Yo, who wanna "rhyme on"?
You cats backing up
When the Blastmaster KRS start acting up
Yeah that gat be up, six-five, I strut with two legs
I see the top of all of you's heads
And that's symbolic of Hip Hop
It's like a jungle sometimes and we like the treetops
Cause when I always spit fly, and rappers get sprayed
I always was taught man, never to be afraid
Who wanna "rhyme on"?
Always spit fly and never be afraid, I'm timeless
We the plus man, they the minus
Nothing sounds like us
These rappers are starting to sound like the black versions of Imus
Me? I'm Akhenaten and writing on papyrus
We old school, don't try us
Let me ask, who wanna "rhyme on"?
Let me get this rhyme on, let me turn my sign on
These lyrics will shine on
If this ain't Hip Hop then I'm wrong
And I'mma be wrong, cause this is it
I take it all the way back to the boom, the boom, the bip
KRS-One, who's gonna jump on this?
