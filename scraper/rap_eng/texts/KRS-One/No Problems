[Refrain]
I know it's rough out there
But you got to..
Stand on your feet, No problems
If you eat and you sleep, you've got No problems
To live is to love and really seek, No problems
No problems, No problems
You've got to..
Stand on your feet, No problems
If you eat and sleep, you've got No problems
To live is to love and really seek, No problems
No problems, No Problems

[Verse 1]
You see these bombs going off like usual business
Up on your feet, your dreams are not finished
Believe in yourself man, I'm speaking a lesson
Instead of stressing over depression just count up your blessings
Rich man or poor man, I'm neither or neither*
KRS don't jerk money and he's no miser
I'm wiser
We could see the rich life is toxic
If you ain't got peace it don't matter whats in your pocket
Switch the topic
I roll with the force so it gets me what I need so I don't worry about the cost
I'm all ?
