"I want the world to know you won't beat us, because we're the children of those who took the worst fall of slavery and brutality that ever lived, that ever existed. Our parents survived the Middle Passage. Only the strong got here, and then we lost our name, our culture, our religion, and we're still here. So you may have a momentary victory, Mr. Bush, but you don't know who we are."

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I pledge no allegiance, fuck the President's speeches!
What the industry did to 'Pac they did to Jesus
Rapin' his vocals, and then destroyin' the message
Tryin' to deport us if they can't destroy and arrest us
Government front religious, but their heart is empty
Like a televangelist preachin' out of his Bentley
Callin' abortion murder in a medical building
But don't give a fuck about bombin' Iraqi children
Talkin' like units in the fuckin' libretto
Look at their mansions and look at your suburban ghetto
The gulag, the new hood where they send us to live
'Cause they don't give a fuck about none of our kids
That's why Blacks and Latinos get the worst education
While devils run America like Birth of a Nation
Affirmative action ain't reverse discrimination
That shit is a pathetic excuse for reparations

[Hook: KRS-One]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga, it was you
Bush knocked down the towers
It was you, nigga, it was you
It was you, motherfucker!

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They say that terrorism revolves around the Qur'an
But that is stupid, I'll show you why it's totally wrong
'Cause if this country was invaded and crumbled
I'd turn Harlem into a Columbian jungle
And I wouldn't be fightin' for a Christian nation
I'd be fightin' for survival from extermination
I wouldn't fight for Fox News, them racist niggas
I'd be fightin' for the hood, for the faceless niggas
For the immigrants America loves to despise
Even though it needs them to make the economy rise
They feed us genetically-modified garbage
So I repetitively reload the cartridge
Boston, New York, down to Atlanta
Guerilla war in the swamps of Louisiana
Camera panoramas of hammers couldn't rock me
East Coast to West Coast, you can't stop me
And fuck Schwarzenegger, his pops was a Nazi
And it runs in the family, so run for the Grammy's
Run to the coon picnic and try to pick up a mammy
But half of y'all are faggots tryin' to pick up a tranny
Eddie Murphy-ass motherfuckers goin' commercial
Even Interscope is gettin' pimped by Universal
Green Tutankhamen Lantern, I curse you and murk you
But the Bin Laden slush fund remix just burked you

[Hook: KRS-One]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga, it was you
Bush knocked down the towers
It was you, nigga, it was you
It was you, motherfucker!
