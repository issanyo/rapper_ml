[Hook: Talib Kweli]
[Scratch] Oh Really?
Oh Really? You think you murdered the track
Impact of the back of the billy, club
Take it back to what rap really, was
Make so much noise we could barely hear your buzz
That's why we've got these rappers scared of us
These other emcees just don't compare to us [x3]

[Verse 1: Krs-One]
KRS-One, Buckshot we back again
Time for you rappers to take of the mask again
From one to ten, we pass the ten
Bumping Dead Prez cause I'm an African
I'm naughty by nature, raunchy by nature, Forty by nature
Y'all Corny by nature; Meaning, all of y'all naturally whack
And I'm naturally dope like coke before crack
Oh Really? I'm more like the weed in this rap
And these new jacks are more like the seeds in this rap
I don't need to react, I don't even need to reach for the gat
I can see how you speak and you act
You'll be laying in the ground in five days
If this was the seventeen hundreds you'd be my slave
If this was ten thousand B.C. you'd be living in my cave
I'm bringing new meaning to the term 'I'm saved'
I'm like a mountain man, unshaved
Walk through ice and fire unscathed
I'm living proof that you get better with your age
Hip-Hop's a journal, I'm turning the page
Yo Buckshot

[Verse 2: Buckshot]
Everybody get the gauge
Don't play with me I ain't a video game, I'm so serious
Put so many holes in your brain, you oblivious
To the fact You owe period
Who the asset and who the ass that, Oh there he is (Hah)
Neck full of high class diamonds
Wrist looking like you made a trip to my hymen
In the colosseum, or harlem, or canal
You cop jewels by the penny weight? I go by the pound
Anyway, I go by the style, not by the sound
So when you cop my CD you can go out of town
Go out of bounds, I'm blowing the whistle, Referee BDP
Y'all know I'm official, Y'all go on my tissue
Y'all niggas are shitty, you get wiped out, lights out
You can't outwit me, outsmart me or outfit me
Yeah this my gear, I got an arsenal with me, nigga it's my year
