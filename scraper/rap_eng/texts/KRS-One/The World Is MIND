You know
Whatever the brain doesn't have a word for it can't see
I teach you this all the time
The world is mind
M-I-N-D

[Verse 1]
There were two patients laying in the hospital
They shared the same room, both fighting health obstacles
The first patient had his bed by the window
He could see outside and feel how the wind blow
The second patient, his bed was by the wall
No window, he couldn't see nothing at all
So in summary there was no sun to see
He was laying in the dark looking for recovery
He could see the other patients looking outside
And jealousy took over his pride, he couldn't hide
He said to the patient by the window
"Hey! Tell me what you see outside there today"
The patient by the window started saying
"I see people walking, talking, I see children playing"
"Cars going by with the booming systems"
But the patient by the wall could only lay and listen
Bedridden, he couldn't see it for himself
But the descriptions he was given was improving his health
Everyday the patient by the window would say what he saw
And everyday the patient by the wall wanted more
But what he wanted even more instead
Was to be in the patient by the window's bed
He wanted the same bed that the patient had
If he could just exchange beds it would make him glad
So one day the patient by the window was gone
And the patient by the wall knew something was wrong
But he still asked the nurse if he could be first
To get the bed by the window, and what's worse
He did get the bed by the window
But the shock instead was a wall full of brick stone
No cars, no people, no scenery
No light, no flowers, no greenery at all
It was like just a brick wall facing the window
He said to the nurse "I was tricked, yo"
The nurse said "Tricked? You'll be fine"
But a view of a brick wall he didn't have in mind
And what really blew his mind
Is when the nurse said, "Cheer up
"The previous patient, he was blind"
He realized right at that time
You create your reality, the world is mind
