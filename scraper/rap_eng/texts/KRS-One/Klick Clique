You know every once in awhile it clicks
It’s like first you don’t know
Then you do know
Cause it clicks

You tryna find your real clique quick
Real quick
But suddenly the truth comes real quick
Klick Clique
Your man’s a child real quick
So Klick Clique

Put when the Five-O flashed that badge
You felt sick
Klick Clique

[Verse 2:][Torae]
Klick
One day it just clicks
[?] length with the teacher
The pencil real shake
Klick
Klick
Every mark spar the clique
To huddle round in a circle
To hear the guard spit
Klick
Click clack
Been the sound of the gat
And every rhyme like a round
To your crown till it crack brap
Clack click
Your jammy is jam shit
Hand no hand in your
Handlers handywork you hand thick
Klick
Click your remote
Click the revolt
If you ain’t clicking
You ain’t fitting
To depict the results
Klick
Started off real criminal mind
Take it by any means necessary
Designed the blueprint
Klick
Clicking your name
The clique in the game
When it’s all said and done
Name a clique that remain
I came in thick for my clique
I’m dippin the same
Picture this song
Song crips
Click, print it
And frame

Don’t you get it
I wouldn’t have said it the first time
Klick Clique

Klick Clique
Don’t you get it
I wouldn’t have said it the first time
Klick Clique
You know every once in awhile it clicks
[record scratching]
Don’t you get it

Klick Clique
It’s like first you don’t know
Then you do know
Cause it clicks
Klick Clique

Don’t you get it
I wouldn’t have said it the first time
Klick Clique
It just clicks
Don’t you get it
I wouldn’t have said it the first time
