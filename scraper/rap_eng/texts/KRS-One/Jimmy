[Intro]
The J, the I, the M, the M
The Y, the J, the I, the M
It's Jimmy! It's Jimmy!
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1]
Here is a message to the super hoes
Just keep in mind when Jimmy grows
It grows and grows and grows, so let it
But keep in mind about the epidemic
When Jimmy releases, boy it pleases
But what do you do about all these diseases?
Jimmy is Jimmy, no matter what
So take care of Jimmy cos you know what's up
Cos now in winter AIDS attacks
So run out and get your Jimmy Hats
It costs so little for a pack of three
They're Jimmy Hats for the winter attack
Good for a present, great for lovers
Demonstrated by The Jungle Brothers
Protect your Jimmy and keep it fresh
They're Jimmy Hats by KRS

[Hook]
So, remember you're never too old (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Remember you're never too bold (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Do me a favour, wear your hat
So Jimmy will have the opportunity to come back

[Verse 2]
Well, Red Alert is down with BDP
Teaching you all about Jimbrowski
I don't wanna hear that you're not with it
Turn around and see your butt in a clinic
Having doctors just poke at Jimmy
Let me express what now what's in me
Too many people take too many risks
Too many people I see get dissed
Jimmy Hats are now in style
Cause you can't trust a big butt and a smile
Some are dry and some lubricated
Many companies make and made it
So all you super hoes, wear your hat
Cos dripping Jimmies is straight up wack
Keep in mind about Jimbrowski
Jimmy Hats by BDP
