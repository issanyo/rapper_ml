[Intro: Swizz Beatz (& KRS One)]
BDP posse, BDP posse
Pete Block posse
Ruff Ryders posse, hey
KRS posse, KRS
We in here, we say

Remix)

BDP Posse
Talk to 'em KRS

[Verse]
Fight back, shoot back, loot that, protest
Brick to the helmet, I ain't feeling no stress
Going up against the cops, I ain't wearing no vest
The city where I come from makes your life hopeless
We're trying to stay focused, go to school, listen
But for us, school is just another pre-prison
The only way the people listen is when they're threatened
So grab your weapon, it'll be on in a second
Class warfare, yeah, we got it all here
The poor gettin' so poor they cannot even bear
The rich gettin' so rich they cannot even share
Or give an equal share to those that got 'em there
[?] right, pay what's right
You got the microphone today, my brother, you gotta say what's right
You know the cops work for the first class, not the rear class
So they get the protection and we get the tear gas

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
BDP posse, BDP posse
Pete Block posse
Ruff Ryders posse (Ruff Ryders) hey
I got my hoodie and mask on
I got my gun and I blast on
BDP posse
Pete Block posse
Ruff Ryders posse
