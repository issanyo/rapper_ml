[Intro]
KRS…yeah, this is it right here
Let me warm up on this
Knowledge Reigns Supreme

[Hook]
I’m a teacher to my people, they won’t leave me alone
With The Alchemist producing Kris, yeah, we in the zone
Anytime I’m in the club, it’s like I’m really at home
You my family, so disrespect, well, we’ll let you know

What you sayin’?
“Squeezing this trigger like a silly bully”

[Verse 1]
You’re going deep with this brother, he don’t speak like no other
He keeps it undercover, only truth he will ever utter
The proof he discover, we use it for many others
That keep another to discover how they keep from not going under
The beat’s like no other, it’s heat like the summer
I was raised in the streets too but I wasn’t bein’ a runner
I wanted them beats that was butter, so I could toast ‘em while I utter
Another club thumper for the summer
I tagged KRS-ONE, uh, with rhymes like thunder
I propelled myself from right under gutter—what, sir?
I’m a wisdom and knowledge lover, a philosophical brother
With Alchemist here, I think we got another

[Hook]
I’m a teacher to my people, they won’t leave me alone
With The Alchemist producing Kris, yeah, we in the zone
Anytime I’m in the club, it’s like I’m really at home
You my family, so disrespect, well, we’ll let you know

This what you bumpin’ right now
“Squeezing this trigger like a silly bully”

[Verse 2]
I ain’t grow up in a mansion, I grew up in the street, sir
I wasn’t trying to be handsome, sexy or sweet, sir
I used to hang out ‘round Bleecker
By CBGB’s with the air tings with coke and reefer
I was houseless, looking for beats to
Heat the streets, for eat, money and sneakers
Sitting in West 4th eating a pizza
I visualized my whole life as The Teacher
Hip-hopper, showstopper, Glock cocker
Street philosopher, then I met DJ Scott La Rock, and uh
We formed Boogie Down Productions in ‘85
Hip-hop culture about to become politicized
Yeah, we them guys that see them lies
Like Buju said, ‘Seckle with your 45’
It ain’t no horsey ride, we’ve been in the trenches
I’m from 149th Street, Grand Concourse Benches
You don’t even know what tense is
Until rappers are claiming the top spot that KRS-ONE enters
(Just like…) I start taking ‘em out like dentures
Hittin’ ‘em in their ego, shocking their nerve centers

[Hook]
I’m a teacher to my people, they won’t leave me alone
With The Alchemist producing Kris, yeah, we in the zone
Anytime I’m in the club, it’s like I’m really at home
You my family, so disrespect, well, we’ll let you know

What you sayin’?
“Squeezing this trigger like a silly bully”
