[Intro: KRS-One]
Hey, I can't find nothing on the radio
Yo, turn to that station

[Michael Stipe, (KRS-One)]
The world is collapsing around our ears
I turned up the radio, but I can't hear it

When I got to the house and I called you out
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song on the radio
It makes me sad
I meant to turn it off to say goodbye
To leave in quiet, (See ya!) that radio song
Hey, hey, hey (Ha, ha)
(C'mon, c'mon)

I've everything to show (Everything to show)
I've everything to hide (Everything to hide)
Look into my eyes, listen
(Yeah!)

When I got to the show (Yo, ho, ho)
I could tell that you had been crying, crying
It's that same sing song and the DJ sucks (DJ sucks!)
It makes me sad
I tried to turn it off (Turn it off!) to say goodbye, my love
That radio song
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey)

The world is collapsing around our ears
I turned up the radio, but I can't hear it
Yeah

(Yeah)
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
(C'mon, c'mon)

I tried to sing along, but damn that radio song (Yeah)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey

I've everything to show (Everything to show)
I've everything to hide (Everything to hide)
Look into my eyes, listen to the radio
I turned up the radio, but I can't hear it
No, I can't hear it

Hey, hey, hey (Say what?)
Hey, hey, hey (Let me do that thing)
Hey, hey, hey (Hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey (Yeah, boom!)
Hey, hey, hey (Say what, say what, say what?)
Hey, hey, hey (Check it out!)

[Outro: KRS-One]
What are you saying? What are you playing?
Who are you obeying day out and day in?
Huh! Baby, baby, baby, baby
That stuff is driving me crazy
DJs communicate to the masses
Sex and violent classes
Now our children grow up prisoners
All their lives, radio listeners!
