[Intro: KRS-ONE]
KRS-ONE hey yo Jonathan Emile test your mic!

[Verse 1: Jonathan Emile]
Every single step that I have taken up
I’m making up and shaping up my destiny
Making dreams reality to wake them up and shake them up
Get your cake and bacon up
Giving them the best of me there ain’t no rest of me

[Hook: Jonathan Emile]
Find a way to live a way to learn to love to change to grow up
Homie do you, I'mma do me
And in the end brother we gon see
What it is. What it is?
What it is. What it is?
What it is. What it is?
What it is. What it is?

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
Pipes on clear, no fear nothing stopping us
Crack the knuckles up buckle up rocket's up
These days you never know where I may be popping up
Jonathan Emile's for real, I wish you lots of luck
