[Intro: KRS-One]
Feel this, a new experience
And your approach to the lyrics
To the beats and the rhymes
KRS

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
After 19 years of rocking, how do you rank me?
Poorly or greatly? I'm no Johnny-Come-Lately
It's the people that pays me
G-O-D is what raised me
To think that you could blaze me, you must be more than crazy
Radio is Fugazi, XM satellite plays me
Criticism don't faze me, being rich don't amaze me
These princely rappers, they gettin' parked like Paisley
I'm two times the effects like Scoop and Crazy Drazy
I know that no man out there could save me
So I save myself with knowledge of self and [?] that God gave me
No coulda shoulda or maybe
I'm in 2024 with the adult version of your baby
The path of life is so wavy, you can not be lazy
Or mindless like a ship sailing eternal gravy
Through hip-hop we speak so plainly
So let's unite and sail through life as a navy

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)

[Verse 2: KRS-One]
All these people looking at me
Walking with me, staring at me
This is how we work, flash film glaring at me
Little children very happy, I'm signing books CDs
Now I'm signing t-shirts, and yeah my hair stay nappy
Living giving advice on living your life
Oh no, you don't have to be stopped
I'm talking walking working
Inserting energy for certain, not an average person
Temple of hip-hop to hold the over boulder
Money folder for soldier, big up Tony Toker
I don't bridge or poker, not a sauna soaker but come on over
Let's make a plan to get free as we can
Cruisin' the span of this land [?] in a new range rover
Get out the city my friend, they have no pity my friend
The way we treat each other is silly, my friend
When you consider the millions of men and women and children
We gotta raise the quality of living

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)

[Verse 3: Ishues]
Music don't make me, I make it then make it
Make sense, don't it?
And if it don't, you should spend some more contemplation on it
Moments of time spent honing my rhymes
Sent from only the divine, my purpose is mine
And mine alone to define despite your prospective vision
Or skeptic criticism or messed-up definition
I'm a servant of God, don't ever mistake it
And your fate for all that faking, you can never escape it
I'm faceless and raceless, my message is ageless
I'm within all faces the same like with hatred
The Matrix was fake but how they make it so tight?
It's a Mahalia Jackson, imitations of life

[Hook: Dax & (Triune)]
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
Another day (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)
It's just another day for me (beats rhymes living a life)
The only way (in these times it's gotta be life)
[?] freedom (yeah, living)
