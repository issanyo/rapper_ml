[Intro]
Crown Ruler Allah Cee King
Crack that's exactly what this means
And to all the Gods in 86 who are impressed
You better sit right back and listen to this

[Hook]
Crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the jumbo means dumbo
I say crack stay back, crack stay back, crack attack
I say the dime is a waste of time

[Verse 1: KRS One]
Young, proud, middle class, beware yet
Crack infiltrating, it's that you can bet
Now is it politics or lack of leadership
That has a young baby selling her body for a hit
(I say the dime is a waste of time)

Why don't you wake up, girl, at your school
And get knowledge of yourself and the golden rule
Now woman don't you know you're the queen of the Earth
And your precious womb is the home of human birth
So don't sell your body for no crack or dirt
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)

You tell your mother a lie just to get high
And talk about the sneakers that you didn't buy
Just to get a fifty to get high, this new affliction
Some people say it's worst of all
There are no barriers, everyone will fall
First it was heroin from Kennedy to Luther
So now they're in the street just selling woolah woolah
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)

I'm gonna break it down to you if you don't know what I mean
I say cracks mixed with reefer taking over the scene
First it was coke, girl, now that's a brand new thing
Now let's pray to God and let's pray to God
And let's pray to God you don't get addicted to this scene
(I say the jumbo means dumbo)

[Verse 2: Spoken Word - Mark Gibbons]
So what do we say now my young people
What should we do
I say crack stay back, jumbo is a dumbo
And a dime is a waste of time
Young, proud, middle class, beware yet
Cause crack's an infiltration, you can bet
Is it politics or a lack of leadership
Who really knows
But after a blast of this stuff your soul, mind and body goes
Crack stay back, jumbo means dumbo, a dime is a waste of time
Even the upper class you must watch your set
With this stuff you'll lose all your gains, you may even lose your jet
First they gave us heron, they called it Boy
From Malcolm, John F Kennedy, right through Martin Luther King
But now it's cocaine in crack form, hey it's the same old thing
This new affliction's powerful, y'all, some say it is worst of all
There are no barriers this time, with crack everyone will fall
So what do you say now my young people
Black, white, hispanic alike, what do you say now
I say stay back with your crack
I'm no dumbo, keep your jumbo
I value my time, don't want to buy your silly dime
Cracks are the devil in a white disguise
Once you use them you are sure to die
I'm the brother who on TV said
Say no young people and keep your heads
Say no young people, say no

[Hook x2]
