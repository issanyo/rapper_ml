[Verse 1]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad [Boogie Down Productions, Will Always get Paid]
Take a sad song and make it better [We'll take the wackest song, and make it better]
Remember to let her into your heart [Remember to let us into your skin]
Then you can start to make it better [cause then you'll begin to master, rhyming, Rhyming, RHYMING]

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

[Verse 3]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder [Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready]
[I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go]

[Verse 4]
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 5]
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

[Verse 6]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad [Boogie Down Productions, Will Always Stay Paid]
Take a sad song and make it better [We'll take the wackest song, and make it better]
Remember to let her under your skin [Remember to let us into your skin]
Then you'll begin to make it [And then we'll begin to master] [rhyming, Rhyming, RHYMING]
Better better better better better better, oh [rhyming, Rhyming, RHYMING, rhyming, Rhyming, RHYMING]

[Outro]
[Na na na na na, na na na, hey Jude]
[Verse 7: KRS-One]
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls

[Bridge]
Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go
