[Intro]
So you ain't learned the lesson?
You ain't learned the lesson?
Aight, let's go!

[Verse 1]
You got bars for me?
Fuck the cash my nigga, I'll whip that ass for free
Fuck a million dollar battle, I make your car rattle
You ain't making no money on me slave, you're a chattel
Me? I'm a freeman, where your shows at?
I took you out in '86 and the whole world knows that
For 30 years nigga, you ain't spitting no rap
Queensbridge hates your ass, you can't go back
You flow whack, and let me say this for my black kids
Technically I ain't take you out Shan, the crack did
So gather 'round for the celebrity roast
I killed Shan already, so it must be his ghost
I still got it, ain't you get it?
Cause of you the Bridge was over
Till Nas came back with Illmatic
You don't even rap good, G you not hood
You're the opposite of Nas
Just spell your name backwards

[Break]
You still ain't get the lesson
You still ain't get it

[Verse 2]
One hit, two hit, three hit, four hit
Shan you need to forfeit, you already lost it
Face that shit, taste that shit
Hip-hop didn't need your career so I erase that shit
You done, the only way you gonna win this battle
Is if you bite my name and call yourself Shan One
With the "W", but you don't even think that fast
I'm the first and the last, youâ€™re the worst from the past
I'm the Blast, Master, KRS-One
What's up? After 30 years you just stand up?
After 30-something years you just man up?
S-H-A-N is still hugging a nut
What the fuck!? You called my wife out? Man that's so whack
Blow! Nigga hold that! Blow! Nigga hold that!
See, I be going like the ocean, you're a crab
Now bow your head down like you was doing a dab
