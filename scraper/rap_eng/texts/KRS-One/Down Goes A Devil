[Verse One]
Booyaka! Down goes the other man
I stand with bloody ass hands like Redman
Cause I just choked another
Called me in, provoked a brother
So I flipped the script like Danny Glover
The other day, chilling on the lines of unemployment
I feel like flipping and killing devils for enjoyment
My madness, started at the age of 12
When devil's burned down my house like we was living in Hell
It Ain't Hard To Tell like Nas, I'm in a rage
This planet is a cage, I'ma bust like a 12 gauge
From pressure and stress isn't something that can't be forgiven
Is it a dream or a dream that we be living?

[Hook] {x2}
Booyaka! Booyaka!
Down goes the devil
Down goes the devil
Down down goes the devil

[Verse Two]
Putting my head to bed, better yet I rest my dreads
Thinking about these devils and how they got me fed
Up, it's time to gun buck with my shots
Any questions for my attitude I just say, "Why not?"
They've been fucking us
And they've been crushing us
Who stole 200 million from accounting, it wasn't us
400 years of murdering and pillage
Is why you get my middle finger walking through the village
Why increase the peace while beast increase the pressure?
I'm tired of the lecture, the speech is getting trifle
Brothers killing brothers, time to redirect the rifle
To the one who was born in the mountain of the Caucus
Now you're starting us
Walk us in the mall of [?], devil's trickery
Fuck the bickery with the west
The devil's got the hollow points pointed for my chest

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
I walk around maintaining not to be a rebel
But everywhere I look I go there's another devil
He plays a roll like ya down, faker than an actor
Before he gets to me, I'm tracking down a damn cracker
I got mad stress I can't take it no more
Day after day devil's follow me through the stores
Like my pores is sweating me and upsetting me
I don't steal but I wet ya G just for testing me
I always be looking in the mirror of my Land Rover seat ah
The overseer, pulls me over
Just cause I got a Jeep with a phat system
Put down your gun we can toe to toe mister
He thought he was slick like breeze the devil pulled his piece
You figure, he didn't know I was quicker
Non stop shots for Rodney King that's a given
Is it a dream or a dream we be living?

[Hook]
