CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 1
Once upon a rhyme, not long ago
Flat tops were in and you cut your afros..
I went to a club on the hip-house scene..
With Doc Marten's and a pair of baggy jeans..
It might've been Queens..or the Bronx, I think..
..and it was 18 to party, 21 to drink..
I blinked in darkness, the suckers let me in..
The night of my life was about to begin..
Inside now.. NOTHING could stop me...
..Three songs later..met the first... Nice body...!
..a good lookin' girl--
From her voice, I could tell she was a Brooklyn girl..
The world stopped...It seemed to vanish..
I asked what she was...half Black, half Spanish..
Not that it mattered, just conversatin..
She went to the bar and I took her invitation...
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 2
Everybody move, nobody front...
It was February--Black history month..
I turned my beeper off so I wouldn't be on call..
There were 99 bottles of beer on the wall..
..but..none would fall...so I started to reach..
She had two orgasms and a sex on the beach..
Such each...ice cube..and still wanted more..
You know what I was thinkin'? Mmmm..Lipstick on a straw...
I said to the cutie "This is where hello stops.."
...then I flavored her tongue with three different jello shots..
..tasted it off her, her eyes got softer..
She said "You gonna dance now?" -- I said "Thanks for the offer..."
Lost all control; the strobe lights was blinding...
Krs was rhyming...this girl was grinding..
My inhibitions were totally shattered..
...and that's when she told me to "Dance like it don't matter..."
CHORUS
Here and now..you've got to live your life...
Don't worry how-- just go hard tonight..
C'mon--Dance like it don't matter...
VERSE 3 - Krs-One
Dance like it don't matter, on stage a dope rapper...
I see Greenie on the dance floor--- go dada!
Pockets don't grow skinny they grow fatter..
Music pumpin' so damn hard, the glass shatters..
...but...there's Greenie, dancin' to the CD..
I'm gonna be me, I hope this cat sees me..
Party all packed and the drinks are goin' up..
While KRS raps, it's Greenie blowin' up
Dancefloor.. I got the whole spot leanin...
Hear it, the spirit--you got the whole place fiendin'..
Real emceeing, real streets you seein'..
Kickin' live lyrics to live huiman beings..
This is what we do, we're not in a trance..
Like my man Lelu, we like to dance..
Can you dance? Can you move your body?
Can you move somebody? Are you new in the party?
There's the hottie--but her man got the shotty..
...and I'm the emcee that puts the boogie in your body...
