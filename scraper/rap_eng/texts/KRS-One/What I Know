Mental Candy

[Chorus]
(Let me tell you what I know)
What I know is that stuff's gotta go
(Let me tell you what I know)
Watch me freak this flow yo, c'mon, yeah
(Let me tell you what I know)
What I know is that stuff's gotta go
(Let me tell you what I know)
Watch me freak this flow yo, and check it out now

[Verse 1]
When you become serious about your hip hop
Let me know when I freak a flow that shows you the way to go
Unlike others what they sayin' is irrelevant
While KRS-One appeals more to the intelligent
On January 30th, 1906
3000 Africans were killed by some bricks, they don't quit
British troops to be excact, is called the Bambatha Massacre
This took place in South Africa
May 4th, 1978, they still kill
7000 African men, women and children
Tell the world I told ya
This particular killing took place in Cassinga, Angola
But wait there's others
White democrats murdered 60 more African brothers
This took place in Louisiana
And it's called the Coushatta massacre - know your history

[Chorus w/ slight changes]

[Verse 2]
I resemble the herbal when I'm in your mental
I go ungentle, never beginning or ending like a circle
Purple raised emmenagogue from my meditation state
You nift your consciousness when you lift my tape
I'm givin' you these dates tough you'd hate
But to evaluate your own mental state
You're gettin' older not younger
The system keeps you under
Concentrate on living this summer
Check it: 1963, the 15th of September
Four girls are bombed by the KKK
Remember, August 26, 1874
16 Africans are lynched in Tennessee, want some more?
May 14th, 1970
Police killed two African students at Jackson State University
And injured fourteen others
For years America been killing us - sisters, brothers

[Chorus w/ slight changes & Diamond D solo]

[Verse 3]
Give me lyrical skills that build or give me death
When these rappers are out of breath I have two hours worth of rhymes left
You can kill a man by taking him out his land
And putting him in the land he doesn't understand
They teach him to respect Greek mythology
Like Pythagoras, Ptolomies, Socrates
These people are thieves
They stole astronomy, mathematics, all tactics of biology
Even the concept of democracy, stolen from the king Akhenaten
Now logically look, put down the book, use your brain
If you don't know who you are, you are clinically insane
The board of education can't see that
To they deserve to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back, give me my culture
But they don't understand that because they suckers

[Chorus w/ slight changes]
