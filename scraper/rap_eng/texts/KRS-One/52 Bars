[Verse]
I just took a vitamin, but now my eyes are wide and big
And now I'm runnin' up the fuckin' walls like I was Spider-Pig
Flyin' into shit like Al Qaeda did, I'll admit, I'm kinda lit
I just slided a fifth of Irish whiskey inside my lips
And I got rhymes to kick for days, yeah killin' it really pays
Stealin' my flame you'll be chillin' with Billy Mays
I feel amazing, blazing this track, I'm takin' no crap
And the fact you compare to other caucasians is wack
No it ain't Asher Roth and I sound nothing like Action Bronson
I sure as fuck ain't Mac Miller or Mr. Mathers, stop it
They say I'm a mix of Catfish and Hopsin, but I'm passed the nonsense
Waitin' for me to stop's like waiting for AIDS to hit Magic Johnson
So hoe don't push me, pussy you can die slowly
I'll break your legs and leave you in the bushes for the coyotes
You might know me as the rapper known for snappin' his jaws
Rappin' fatter than Santa Claus and never havin' to pause
Man, I just wanna be on stage catching panties and bras
Givin' my all the audience while my fans be in awe
Nowadays rappers respond with a status actin' like broads
MC's as sweet as Reece's Pieces and that's the reason
Competition's passed me, 'cause my only competition's past me
I laugh at these spitters with their Twitter and Instagram beefs
Can't even call it beef, 'cause I learned from Biggie Smalls if heat
Ain't with you while you sleep, odds'll be that you probably
Are not in deep waters G obviously you just wanna see
Your name on the blogs and feeds so everybody thinks you're a raw MC
But honestly, if you think they'd fight, dude you're fooled
They just doin' the same shit that high school girls do
But hype boosts it to be this thing that it really isn't
Giving them an image of a menace but it's still a gimmick
And you give into this farce; regard the nonsense frauds say
But really these artists' hard as Ariana Grande
You silly if you think I mean to respond with gunplay's
How it should be, all I'm saying is just stop the false claims
Like saying you'd clap whoever you sendin' attacks to
Relax dude, don't act stupid it's just a rap feud
I should bash you, but I'm above all you other suckers
Plus I came to show out, so enough of these motherfuckers
Let's get into some lyrical shit, here we go bitch
When hearin' me spit your ears are in bliss but you clearly look pissed
'Cause you fear to admit for years you've written inferior hits
Now it appears to be quits so you steer your whip and veer off a cliff
You delirious if you seriously think you come near to this
You queers'll get severely dissed then I'm smearin' your tears with piss
So give your career a switch, hip hop is just not working out
But based on your current sound you'd be perfect as a circus clown
You jerk around when you're writin' your rhymes
Your skills ain't as ill as Nature's, mine alter your mind
I kill haters, spill they blood, dry off and then I
Will feel great as Bill Hader high on Item 9
I'm live as the vital signs on Michael Myers, I'm immortal fool
See you can't forge SigNature, but there's a million more of you
