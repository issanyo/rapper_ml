[Intro]
Alright, now here we go

[Verse 1]
T'cha t'cha, that boy is a t'cha
I want you all to understand I'm down with BDP
I got so many styles, but I'm not an MC
I am a teacher teaching rap, and of course I am back
Because these other MC's out here are so weak and wack
So BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them
BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them
All about the guy who first is down but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker
Among thousands and thousands of very good MC's
A poet will flow like the breeze
Like the wind, air is all around us
From what I hear, it's a good thing you found us
And in a hurry, just in the nick of time
Cause I do four things: rhyme, produce, teach, and bring to you new styles
Well here's the first style, right out the pile
It's called vocabulary. Difficult, isn't it?
At least is looks that way when you witness it
Kill (kill?) meaning to deprive of life
Fiancee: future wife
Poet (poet): a person who writes poems
Wandering, meaning to roam
Everyone sees me when I walk into the public
Even the suckers, I just love it
When they get disgusted every time I prove
(Boogie Down Pro...) Boogie Down Productions will move
Meaning to motivate, lest rhyme straight
Hate is a very very big mistake
It rhymes with frustrate and aggravate
Let me just demonstrate why I won't abbreviate
Television, a view of scenes transmitted
Every single second you get it
Pepsi (what?) the choice of a new generation
Fired from work: termination
Quality: something special about an object or person
Can you rock a party without rehearsing?
I can, anytime, on the spot rhyme
Many recording artists can't do it, but I'm
More than just a recording artist kicking dust (who?)
I'm a sandstorm, taking human form
K plus R S equals one
I don't burn anymore, I just cook 'till you're done
And when you're done, then I serve
Like alphabet soup, (letters) letters, (words) words
Sentences, chunks of meat into a paragraph
Get the meaning then ask the question 'bout the guy
Who first is down but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker

[Verse 2]
Kewe-kewe-K, Arewa-arewa-R, Ewe-ewe-S, my rhymes are fresh
Please step back, let me progress
Meaning to advance, you only get a glance
Of me at a time, sayin' some rhyme
Or sayin' some rekkid, that should respect it, select it
I'm never ever wack or reject it
Challenge BDP it get's dissed, expect it
I travel the nation by mostly plane
I travel New York by either cab or the train
Some say that I'm insane, they say
Why would you want to ride the train
(But I) but I don't care, as long as I get there
I never used to pay my fare, but now I think I got to
Because from a jail cell I can't rock you
That's being incarcerated, meaning locked up
(A tool) a tool for holding water is a cup or pail
The opposite for fresh is stale
(The largest) the largest sea-mammal is a whale
Beer is called ale, or sometimes it is called brew
(A group a) a group of human beings is a crew
You know what I'm gonna do? Explain Criminal Minded
Cause much too many people still are blinded
Let me rewind it, and elaborate on blinded, meaning can't see through me
He he he he he, these people make me laugh
The way they like to change up the past
So when you're there in class, learning `his story'
Learn a little of your story, the real story
It doesn't pay to know the life and times of someone else
It doesn't benefit your wealth or your mental health
I go for self, but the real self is one with all
The self who's by himself does fall
Down, just like the guy who first was down, but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker

[Outro]
Alright, now here we go
