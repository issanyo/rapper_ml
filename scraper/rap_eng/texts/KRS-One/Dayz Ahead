[Intro]
Godcore
Urban inspirational
Holy Hip-hop
You know the type, all in your city
Word up

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 1]
Let's come together once and for all
Before our children cannot walk in the mall
Before we can not talk or walk at all
Already aviation is stalled
Now everybody wants to drive, bringing our highways to a crawl
Just about three weeks on back
I was talking to a journalist about my album, the Sneak attack
Now I know, why I felt that way
Why the cards God revealed to me was dealt that way
Be prepared for the unexpected, that was the theme
But if your booty's shaking, you can't know what that means
Look, we all, in the, same, game
It's that world bank game that got struck with two flame
But we, yes the people, are struck with true pain
Coz the world Bank'll do the same under a new name
We gotta recognize the prize, and the people at the door
No more lies, you can no longer ignore

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 2]
I know [Know what?]
I know! [What you know?]
What do I show? [What you show?]
Capitvating lyrical flow!
[They don't play it on radio!]
Yeah, but the spirit know
But only a few can hear it though
The metaphysical lyrical blow
The minute you're in it and hear it, yo
See the evil and clear it, yo
See that for as many that died there was twice as many miracles
Uh, So let the dead bury their dead
Life is but a dream, and in the dream we gotta get ready for bed
Better we look ahead instead, to the ones that survived
Pray for them too, coz there grace of God kept them alive
Yes we mourn for the dead and will still kill for them
But what about the injured that must still rebuild again?

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

[Verse 3]
To all the people, that never lost someone
Consider the cost of the loss of a lost daughter or son
These cowards slaughter and run
And to know that there's more than just one
Makes you wanna store up your gun
And withdraw all the funds, but

[Hook]
I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The love I give to you, you give to me

I know that the dayz ahead are dark
But you can shine the light that's in your heart
You've got-ta see yourself in victory
The respect I give to you, you give to me
