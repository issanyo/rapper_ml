[Chorus]
Symbols of injustice and hatred
Confederate flag (bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

[Verse 1]
I ain't here for selling shit
Me I came for telling it
I tell it like it is
So my people stay intelligent
We ending it
Racism, slavery, we ending it
This is why we bringing down the flag of the confederate
I share the same sentiment: Slavery is bad
But slavery was established by the american flag
Follow me
The american flag it flew in every colony
To break down the confederate only ia a hypocrisy
You bringing down one flag to raise up another
When both flags ensalved my sisters and my brothers
Yea man there were others
African, french, the portuguese
The english, the spanish, enslavers for all of these
So why raise any flag that killed my mom and my dad
Invaded my lands with plans to take up all that they had
I'm glad, the confederate flag is banned today
But the American flag is still flown by the KKK

[Chorus]
Symbols of injustice and hatred
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
Symbols of human enslavement
Confederate flag (you gots to bring it down)
But what about the red, white and the blue
American flag (you gots to bring it down)
Racists flew that flag when they captured you
American flag

[Verse 2]
KRS, the right teacha
In the street I might see ya
Under the American flag blacks had no rights either
Women had no rights either, natives had no rights either
White abolitionist had to fight against white preacher
Red, white and blue should mean red, white and black
Blue was our indigo color, coming from way back
But the system is racist, when the murderers are acquitted
So we ride in the streets, then you say we shouldn't have did it
"they destroying their cty", man you don't get it
If this was my city I wouldn't be getting shot in it
Stopped in it, harressed, unemployed and always locked in it
While the guns, the polution and drugs are always trapped in it
Turn the tv off man, don't listen to all that
You a global citizen, you got to know all the facts
You a global citizen, you got to know how to act
Ask yourself, what does the American flag mean to Iraq?
