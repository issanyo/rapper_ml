Take it.. right now..
Don't hesitate!  (world peace)
You want world peace?  (world peace)  (peace.. TAKE IT)
Or world talk?

(world peace..)
(world peace..)
(world peace..)

Yo, a lot of people are under the assumption
That peace, is soft or somethin
We must begin to reprogram our thought
FROM, how we were taught
Back in school, and our TV screens
Strength, is always mean
Love, is always soft
And peace is too peaceful
When all are equal
Sit back, and read the papers
About the murderers, thieves, and rapists
We depend on police for justice
But when do we say, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
Right now, and call their bluff
It's not a matter of frontin like you're tough
It's a matter of takin yours
And livin universal laws
Cause those laws, cannot be bribed
Nor changed, or paid on the side
You must come correct and walk straight
More love, less and less hate
When you walk, walk with AUTHORITY
Tell the negative people, don't bother me
Move your face away, I ain't with it
In a minute, I'm gonna hit it!

	If we really want world peace
	and we want it right now
	We must make up our minds to take.. it..
Right now!
	If we really want world peace
World peace..
	and we want it right now
.. or world TALK
	We must make up our minds to take.. it..

Break it down!
Take it, yeah!
World peace..
Yeah.. come in..

CRASH, SMASH, don't ask
When the negative disrupts the class
How much longer?  Get stronger
The battle is getting longer
World, peace, or world talk
Do we run?  Or do we walk?  (CHARGE)
If you want world peace, take it
Cause a lot of our leaders FAKE IT (fraud)
It's similar to armageddeon
When the positive people stop lettin
The negative, control, how we live
Listen to the music I give!
