[Verse 1]
Okay
Okay
Okay let's do this
Uh huh
Before I spit the verse I'm versed up
I got to take a moment for some ancestor worship
Scott La Rock all day
Ms. Melodie all day
(?) all day
Kwame Toure okay
They watching over KRS today
There's so many ancestors with me
Man watch what you say
You don't even know how I got here
So many dudes are not here
So I do not fear
When the roads is not clear
We are not alarmed with it
(?) in the darkness I'm the spark in it
With every sentence your intelligence I sharpen it
Like a knife or a box cutter you cut the carpet with
Spark that shit
Dudes don't know how deep Chris Parker get
You hear the art I spit
Cause I was at the start of it
The cypher is hyper when KRS is part of it
The same cypher's incomplete when apart from it

[Verse 2]
Let me make this really clear
They are not us
All these wack twitter rappers I do not trust
They will pull out the gat but they will not bust
They will witness injustice but they will not fuss
They sitting at home thinking they can stop us
I'm flicking ashes on these asses leaving them in the dust dust
Criminal minded
Spiritual minded
Political minded
My lyric you can time it
Watch how I rhyme it
Spit, shine, and grind it
Autograph and sign it
No corporation behind it
Free man, free MC, and free-minded
You looking for authentic and real
Well I'm it
These critics be amazed they don't know what it means
KRS still ripping it in 2017
On to 2018, 2019
Its a crazy scene, I'm all in their face like Maybelline
