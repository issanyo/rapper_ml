[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 1]
Flashlights, canine dogs and crooked copper's
Automatics, tear gas, rams and helicopters
Off of marijuana, on the East Coast every year
While California selling that high grade everywhere
It's crazy how the East Coast considers herb the enemy
While every corner in LA is a dispensary
The country been split on this issue now for a century
Why would a natural harmless herb lead to a felony?
New York need to catch up
The pace need to pick it up
You know them prosecutors got big spliff litted up
Switch the philosophy think of the economy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook x2]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 2]
People taking risks
Cause they know that money gon' come
The drug game is global
Paying off twenty to one
Who you telling?
You don't think these politicians they selling?
Doctors ain't sellin', cops ain't sellin'
While rocking your melon?
Cop cars smelling like Cali blue dream
In New York brothers like "What do you mean?"
I mean switch the velocity
Think of the economy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 3]
Brothers on that lock down
Sisters in that lock up
Things were good in the hood
Till them D's popped up
Brothers getting shot up, cause the systems unjust
Segregated justice
It's just them and just us
Cops roam around like a gang trying to jump us
Into the plantation prisons they wanna dump us
Cause they're really prisons for the poor
It's about the money, not the drugs
That's what I'm getting handcuffed for
It ain't about the law, it ain't about the crime
Cause banks are paying fines for their crimes all the time
Huh it's a setup, switch the philosophy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from

Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won
