[Verse 1]
Some people think that they’re in commercials
Some people treat you like you don’t exist
Sometimes I want to go, to a McDonald’s
Shoot some people as they walk, in my sights
(All the same) All the same, I’d never join the army
All the same, I’m still ashamed at night
U oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon

[Verse 2]
Some people think Rod McKuen is a poet
Some people think there’s evil folks and good
Some people vote to electrocute the bad ones
They stand outside the prison and cheer when the lights go dim (All the same) I know everybody is my brother
Even my brother, though I don’t care, much, for him
U oh-oh-oh
U oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
C’mon, baby let’s fight the good fight
(Against all good fights)
C’mon, baby let’s fight the good fight
(Gonna make it through the night)

[Chorus]
C’mon, c’mon
C’mon, c’mon
(C’mon, baby) C’mon, baby let’s fight the good fight (They say)

[Break]
La-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

[Final verse: KRS-One]
Cut the B.S
Just what are you telling me?
You have the right to your own, death penalty?
Snap out of it, and smell the coffee
You're above the Ten Commandments?  You've lost me
So where is the death penalty for you?
Now that you murder and spread lies, too
"In God We Trust" on the dollar bill
Congratulations, substitute a pill

[Outro]
C'mon, c'mon, they say, they say
C'mon, c'mon, they say
C’mon, baby
C’mon, baby
C’mon, baby, baby, baby, baby
C’mon, c’mon, they say
