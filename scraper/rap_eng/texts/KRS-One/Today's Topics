My man Chuck D
You start it off for us
It take one plan, here's the issues
FIRST~!

[Chuck D] + (KRS)
We don't control shit (second)
No education enforcement (third)
And damn sure no economics (fourth)
Dependin on governments
Forever in a plantation state (fifth)
You know why? Damn that's why I hate hate (six)
Wanna do somethin for the people, make us equal (seven)
Instead of creatures, who got human features (eight)

Let the whole world reach you (nine)
Then classrooms can't reach you (ten)
Yo T'cha (what?) Hit me, drop it now!

Yo today's topic, self-creation
You can front if you like but it's your time you wastin
It's your mind you wastin, that's why I'm replacin
Ignorance with awareness that we are a nation
Hip-hop, we create the future we facin
Man - you see what we doin, you still debatin
Still complacent, still hatin
But you'll see there is no revolution, without revelation
