[Spoken Intro]
Peace, here we go again
Sir Vicious Just-Ice, and I’m pissed off
I’ma talk about this girl, she’s a Booga Bandit Bitch
You know what I’m sayin’
She might be your mother, your aunt, your sister, or maybe your girlfriend
But who cares? Just bust the story, know’m’sayin’
Check it out

[Verse 1]
This fascinating drama I’m about to tell
Is based on facts and exact as well
It’s a point that’s true, from me to you
To all you females that think you’re cute
When you’re hanging with your crew, no one bothers you
But you persist and even diss anyone that come through
You would even laugh, scream out or just hiss
Any act or emotion to describe the diss
Once she looked me up and down, and screamed out “Please”
Said, ‘hold it one minute, this shit has gotta cease’
Since you did disrespect the one you address
The payment is fatal and close to death
I possess immortal power by the way I defeat
I’m ambidextrous to a rhythm that’s hard like concrete
When I’m on the mic, there won’t be no debate
‘Cause my anger and humor, it will fluctuate
When I didn’t even know ya, I tried to speak
But your ignorance response made it incomplete
Tried to be real nice, arise to talk
I heard a stupid response, then I started to walk
‘Cause my time is consumed with energetic goals
With radiant rhymes that always glow
If you see me on the street, at a party, on the stage, please
Don’t even smile or even wave
‘Cause you you’re your chance, your time has elapsed
Now face Sir Vicious and feel my wrath
To conclude this chapter and end this shit
Don’t say nothin’, you Booga Bandit Bitch

[Verse 2]
This story I’m telling is definitely selling
No screaming or yelling at you, in fact, I’m very overwhelming
This verse is strictly for the brothers
So girls, disregard, and wait for the others
To be very blunt and truly legit
I’m talking about a specific Booga Bandit Bitch
Brothers, about the girls who like flaunt and taunt
Shake their nasty boots, stanky when they walk
Mouth full of lies, awful odor when you pass
Big cigarette, breath smelling like dragon ass
For all of the ladies, this is not a diss
I’m talking about a Booga Bandit Bitch
When you ‘re living in the projects, you know what I mean
The kind of girl who begs and is a drug fiend
Hanging in the spot, frontin’ like it’s a job
Basin’ all of the product, but she had to slob knob
That’s fine with her, yo, no problems yet
Jimbrowski line up ‘fore her piece get wet
4, 5 in the morning, cold shaking about
Can’t sleep in your house ‘cause your mother locked you out
You sorry ass wench, go sleep on the bench
Go turn you a trick for about 10 cents
The day comes around, it’s time to change
Skeleton in the closet, your clothes rearranged
Wash up, make up, thick lipstick
You still ain’t nothin’ but a Booga Bandit Bitch

Don’t ever call me in your life, bitch…

[Verse 3]
She’s a slick bitch, a dirty broad
Frontin’ for nothin’, perpetratin’ a fraud
As my great rhyme bar starts to percolate
Then the drill of my rhyme start to perinate
‘Cause it’s hard as hell to communicate
With the powers undivided as I demonstrate
As these depth shore stunts climb up to the beat
I’m able to rock a party any day of the week
Up on a Friday night ‘til the Saturday morn
Pardon me, everybody, while I keep on
My level comply if you will imply
At the end, no reason to further verify
Body in shock, your mouth starts spinning
Your head in a daze, your mouth’ll start grinning
Like working for a compound, drop before you get down
If you can’t hang, I’ll catch you on the rebound
Rhymes so treach, start to feel lowdown
Bring your spirits back up with the same old sound
Just-Ice, Ice-Just, that’s right, I’m serious
Like chewing sweet candy, it’s “ah, so delicious”
So tasty, never hasty, I might say maybe
And if you think you’re good, baby, you tried to play me
Like the heavy duty machine, that’s what I’m like
Crushing tons of MC’s, ‘cause that’s my delight
Let’s drop all of that, came here to tell ya
A cool MC, a nice kind of fella
The way I rock the house, I could get away clean
The way I speak my words, I could rock the whole scene
And get party jumping, people start to clap
Hear me on the mic as I commence to rap
Future shock of the party, with me, you just start
Work it out real good ‘til you bust your heart
Gotta do it with the flow, let it go, not fast
Keep it in deeper but just let it last
Like a homerun hitter, I’m ready to score
Like a tough girl, get her when I want some more
That’s how it is with me, you know that’s fine
‘Cause the way I’m always moving, I hardly have time
Make rapper come thin and become fat
Esther look good and Beretta turned black
For all other hopers, just listen
Take your mind into another world dimension
Put my chalice on display, my show just rocked
And let everybody know I can’t be stopped
Just-Ice rocked the house, turnin’ it out
Without a doubt, ha
Hey, that’s that old school type shit
