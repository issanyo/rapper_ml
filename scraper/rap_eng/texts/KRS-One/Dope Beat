[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 1]
My name is at the top of all of those that mix
Or turning poetry into cash for 87
Some did it got paid, some jams were never played
But I am just a poet who watched the whole parade
Go by, and why? Cos they wasn't fly
Others claim to be fresh, but they're not KRS
I cannot walk around the street with my head in the clouds
Either running on my gear or having colors too loud
Everything must coincide with the way I feel
And by the way it's Scott La Rock on the wheels of steel
So I take one step to adjust the mic
I get around the whole city so I do wear Nike
I like a funky beat, a studio like Unique
I write the crazy fresh lyrics and I don't eat meat
You can look me up and down and my DJ too
Because we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew
Taking out emcees on the 1, 2, 3
No matter who they claim to be in society
Because we know their games, we'll pull their file
If they need a different style we can get wild
He's I.C.U., he's out to kill
I'm KRS and we get ill
DJ Scott La Rock got his own beat
The extravagant life is what we seek
I will tell you like this cause I know for a fact
I will live a long life and I don't smoke crack
Captivating the crowd seven days a week
You know what they told me to say? I got the dope beat

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 2]
For me to say again another verse of my rhyme
Means what you heard before must've blew up your mind
So now it's time to find poetry like mine
Do not waste all your time because I'm one of a kind
Cooling out and easy going cause the money be flowing
6'4", brown eyes, and I'm always showing
Stupid emcees on the mic the way it's 'posed to be done
They study rhymes all week but I be rhyming for fun
When they lose they get upset, always pulling a gun
But they must snap out of that because I'm KRS-One
Not two, not three, but O-N-E
Get it right the first time I won't repeat this rhyme
If you think that you can burn me with your amateur ways
Keep in mind that I been out there from back in the days
I don't brag about the people I know
Because they're still bluffing, they're not givin me nothing
I can walk around the city with the rhymes I flaunt
Cos no matter how you front it's still the ones you want
See, I am funky fresh and poetry is my opinion
Taking out you suckers while the Scott La Rock is spinning

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Verse 3]
My name is KRS-One, I'm still kinda young
I don't wear Adidas cos my name ain't Run
Got Nikes on my feet and to be complete
I can rock an American or reggae beat
Got rhymes for the 70's, 80's, and 90's
Not being conceited but it won't pay to try me
Out to any feud, any battle, any reason
Make the rhymes up every season, this style, I'm just teasing
Pick up the pace, homeboy, pick up the pace
You're way behind schedule, listen to what I'm telling you
This particular style may vary
The things I converse about are heard rarely
Some can't bear me, others try to scare me
Sounding intelligent but not yet equivalent
You know what?

[Hook]
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (you got a dope beat)
I got a dope beat (we got a dope beat)

[Outro: Scott La Rock]
I.C.U. is in the house
Miss Melodie is in the house
Lena Love is in the house
D-Nice rocks the house
Gold Miss Item rocks the house
Flavius Walker turns 'em out
42 Black knocks 'em out
To my mellow Moses Gun, rock the house
Norty busts it out
McBoo turns it out
Chuck Chillout cuts it up
Red Alert works it out
Scott La Rock Jr. my pride and joy
KRS-One, his mother's first son
And I know he'll never run
???
Scott LaRock... Scott LaRock
