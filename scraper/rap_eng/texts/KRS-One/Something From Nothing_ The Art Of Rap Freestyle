I bust gat heat right here at Fat Beatz
My man Ice-T, that is that heat
We here in LA chillin', KRS always willin', rhymes keep spillin'
I'm off the top, like what, the sun
My name is KRS-One, these stars, you don't see none
When I come out you see all the day
These other whack rappers, we blow 'em away
Why? Cause they don't understand my cycle
I go from tape, CD, back to vinyl
Shh, you cats ain't ready!
I take it back to RockSteady and give you a classic medley
Me? I'm not B-E-T or M-T-V, I'm H-I-P H-O-P
