Be strong, be strong

[Intro: KRS-One]
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
You must tell these devils, word, {*HA! HA!*}
You got to tell a devil {*HUH*}, then tell a devil {*HA!*}
Got.. word.. what, {*HA! HA!*}
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, huh huh {*HA!*}
Be strong! {*HA! HA!*} Word
Stand on the rock (.. stand up on the rock ..)

[Verse One: KRS-One]
When the devil got your soul, and you ain't got control
You know you Born Again, but you feel like you old
You put your mind on Christ, or put your mind on Kris
For everlasting life, you must listen to this
Now you could get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll go with this, yo Christians where you at?
Oh yes it's KRS, with Church of the Harvest
With Clarence {?}, hip-hop's winning evangelist
And then there's Hezekiah, his fire brings the fire
He's takin it higher, tell 'em {THE DEVIL IS A LIAR}
I know, you thinkin bout that Y2K
And I see, this fear that makes you lose your way
But we got, somethin that is bigger than Benz
And we stand, upon the rock that cannot break
Through millineiums, don't you think we been here before?
Through millineiums, God has always opened the door
Word!

[Hook: KRS-One]
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
You got to tell the devil {*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*}
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
Word, word up {*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*}
Word {*HUH*} {*HA!*}
{*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*}

[Interlude]
(.. be strong ..) Be strong (.. be stronnnnnnnng ..)
Be strong!  Word
(.. be strong ..) Be strong (.. be stronnnnnnnng ..)
Endure!  Endure!

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo, if all you got is money and the little things you wear
You worry bout your car note, you worry bout your hair
Then you ain't got no faith, and you must live in fear
Now listen to me people, and listen to me clear
So like I was just sayin, I think it's time for prayin
Don't put your trust in Satan, it's Christ you put your faith in
You minimize your hatin, and stop your hesitatin
It's faith that keeps you movin, so do not be mistaken

[Hook: KRS-One]
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
You must to tell the devil, word {*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*} word
You got to tell the devil {*HUH*} UHH tell the devil {*HA!*}
You got to tell the devil, word {*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*} word
You must tell the devil {*HUH*}, you must tell the devil {*HA!*}
Word, tell that devil, word {*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*} wo-word
You must tell the devil {*HUH*} uhh {*HA!*} uh-huh, yo
{*Ahhhhhhhhhh HA! HA!*} Yo

[Verse Three: KRS-One]
Now you listen to these lyrics, they speak into your spirit
You shiver when you hear it, but some just cannot bear it
But when you get up near it, there's no need that you fear it
It's KRS O-N-E you know me hip-hop be spirit
So you tell the devil HUH, tell that devil HA
Tell that devil HUH, tell that devil HA
You must tell the devil HUH, tell that devil HA!
Get out of my life, change your life, word
