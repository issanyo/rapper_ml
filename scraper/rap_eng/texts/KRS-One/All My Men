Woooooooooo!
Where my men at? Real dudes
Where you at? Look

[Hook: KRS-One]
Me is a mon, understand, not a passin trend
Me is a mon, understand, we provide and defend
Me a mon with a plan, my love it never ends
I'm callin - all my men, ALL MY MEN~!

[KRS-One]
All my men that be holdin down they house and they spouse
Men, y'all know what I'm talkin about
Real men, providin for the kids, no doubt
Holla out, 'gwan shout, you the man of the house
Men! In my opinion if we gonna start winnin
F'real, we gotta respect women
Every mister, hug your sister, it's the
Time to support your woman and not diss her
It's the, teacher, overstand
I'm like a preacher, reachin your upper man
Man, many don't understand
How important it is to have a plan

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
All my men that be holdin they house down, true workin
All my men that be holdin they spouse down, for certain!
You spread love when you drivin around town, not jerkin
You a healer, you take away what's hurtin
Cause if a man can't do what a man plans to do, his purpose
Then a man makes plans with empty hands, he's worthless
He can't even understand the plan
What the second or the first is
Let me verse this or reverse this statistic
We gotta think futuristic
Strategic, logistical and even mystical
We need a new ritual
I'm tired of jumpin over buildings
And havin to stop to hold adult hands like children
C'mon, you can do it, c'mon
And when they get paid then they quickly run along
This ain't just another song
This is that fruit that reveals the right from the wrong
It won't be long here, before the storm's here
And real men are gonna have to be strong

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[KRS-One]
Be a MON, stand on principle
Just be a MON, let God live in you
Just be a MON, walk in the spiritual
Metaphysical, political, lyrical
Just be a MON! Understand you not a passing trend
And this is the end
