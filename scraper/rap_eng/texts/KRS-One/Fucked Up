[Intro]
YEAH! YEAH!
C'mon...
Let me tell you cats {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
Snitchin and squealin and the underhand dealin
That's how you get fucked up!!
Robbin and stealin like you ain't got feelings
That's how you get fucked up!!
Gettin head in the bed with another man's wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 1]
People walk around just, in a daze and oblivious
To them demons that live in us
Who can you really trust
Is it them demons that got us schemin or is it really us?
People really fuss, and them guns really bust
Brothers dyin over silly stuff
Them streets can get really tough
They ain't playin man, you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
When you can't forgive and all you spit is negative
That's how you get fucked up!!
When you're dissin your elders and cheatin your relatives
That's how you get fucked up!!
Messin with a man's crib, kids or wife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better think twice how you're livin your life, cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm a true school cat, just a cool cool cat
Got security tellin these people to move back
I got two new tracks, somethin new from DAT's
Tunnel Rats with Proper and Triune in the back
I don't move with a pack, I move membership
Hip-Hop we livin it and what I'm doin is rap
But cats wanna talk that crap
'Til they see that I'm not playin, you better {get what I'm sayin}
Everyday more betrayin, more lyin, and from friends
More crime and more revenge - HUSH
Things are really rough; cause there's really no one out there
That I doubt that you can really trust
Them guns bust - how many hustlers gotta die
Go to jail for a fiend to get a rush?
From ashes to dust, that man of lust
Is decayin, you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
Talkin that crap behind another man's back
That's how you get fucked up!!
Spittin gossip and scandal and don't have facts
That's how you get fucked up!!
Bein caught in the hype, flashin off your ice
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!!

[Verse 3]
I'mma close it out, cause all my foes they doubt
I'm rollin out, they know what I'm all about
I don't roam about, I appear and shout
I wear 'em out, then we clear 'em out
I steer the route to where the end be at
Where the peace, where the love, where my friends be at
Where the jealous ones envy that
And they start betrayin, that's right you better {get what I'm sayin}

[Hook]
If you schemin a lot on what another man's got
That's how you get fucked up!!
Dreamin up a plot for another man's spot
That's how you get fucked up!!
If you live by the knife then you die by the knife
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!!
Flashin what you got cause you think it's cool
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better watch yourself cause when you ACT A FOOL
That's how you get fucked up!!
When you act like you better, treatin men like mice
That's how you get fucked up!!
You better always think twice how you're livin your life cause
That's how you get fucked up!! {get what I'm sayin}
.. {get what I'm sayin}
