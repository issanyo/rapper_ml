[Intro: KRS-One]
Who is the DJ that's cutting it up?
Bring it back yo, bring it back
Mad Lion, KRS-One. Set, set it!

[Verse One: Mad Lion]
Act like ya know and don't act like a slob
Or else you're gonna give my gun a blow job
[?] fool and crazy
Your little Illegal style can't phase me
[?] breathing indo
Mad Lion mad and I kill people too
Whether with mic or a gun
[?] there's no place to run
No place to duck and no place turn
[?]

[KRS-One]
Lyric for lyric, KRS with god mad enthusiasm excite
The protoplasm to the orgasm
Or neck spasm
This ain't no phantasm
Title I smash 'em, your favorite rapper you can't match him
Against this
Mad Lion and Kris
Ten years ago we passed but they persist, so we ask 'em
"Who don't you think about when you think about
Taking an MC out?
It's the Teacher no doubt
Oratorically supreme
I don't go up in the mainstream, I go up in your bloodstream
Like the dope fiend
Me? You could never double team
That's the impossible dream
I don't lack self esteem I gleam
Still it seems
As I read Vibe magazine
Rappers day dream about letting off steam
You know what I mean when I roll up on the scene
And go to the extreme
On your peaches and cream team
Keep your conversations to a minimal
Mind it, I'm still Criminal Minded
If you listen you'll find it
Any time you wanna commit professional suicide
Find my tour guide
Collide where I reside
And you'll be hog tied
Crucified and drip dried
I'm amplified like the five o'clock free ride
You've been notified, we can take this outside
Statewide, along the country side I'll leave you cross eyed

[Mad Lion]
Give thanks and praise while big spliff blaze
Watch out

Keep in mind who started this flow
Mad Lion, yo you better act like you want it
Lyrics we flaunt it and float it, we own it
You copy, we wrote it
See
Clickity, click click
In goes the magazine
[?] against your spleen
Cause we don't sta-stutter
We don't sta-stammer
Gunshot [?] and now you skin like a Hummer
My grammar
Is great
Whoever underrate
I keep it nice and spiffy for all you pirates
Who rape, this style I create?
Mistake
I'm real, you're fake

[KRS-One]
Yeeeeah
They were talking loud, now they mumble
The ball they fumble
My lyrics bump like razor stubble, double trouble
The Remix, I gat ya, the Funk is the Master
As I Flex on the next rapper when I'm vexed
Checks are cashed
As ass is grass fast
In a flash, long last the flavor from the Blastmaster major
Captain
Inner city general rapper
And we kept it real
No sugar, no saccharin
While other reggae artists chase the platinum, we don't fear 'em
Yesterday they were large, today you don't hear 'em
Like clothes we wear them out
Paper we tear them no doubt
Mad Lion come and take 'em out

[Mad Lion]
Double trouble
That's what you get when my blood pressure bubble
Piss in the grate, your body turn into rubble
Never want gold
You never were humble
Now it's time pitty bad bwoy them rumble
[?] a football fumble
No you wanna walk through the lion's jungle
Bring all your crew
Bust slugs and rumble
That's why the lion him say

[Outro: KRS-One]
Big Daddy Rickster is down with us
G. Simone is down with us
Funkmaster Flex is down with us
Channel Live is down with us
My man Fat Joe is down with us

Commissioner Gordon is down with us
Making funky music is a must, I'm number one!
