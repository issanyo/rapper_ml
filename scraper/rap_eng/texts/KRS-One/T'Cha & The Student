KRS-ONE: Welcome to the Temple, class is in session. Me, I'm the teacher---asking all questions. Question 1 - What am I being?
GREENIE : Y-Y-Y-Y-You a rapper !!!
KRS-ONE: Wrong! I'm emceeing..
GREENIE: What's the difference?
KRS-ONE: Well, it's the unity; The rapper is corporate, the emcee is community
GREENIE: Community rap?
KRS-ONE: It's something like that...for emceein'... but the question was...
'What am I being?"
GREENIE: What are you being?
KRS-ONE: Can anyone answer this? What are you seeing? Can anyone answer Kris?
GREENIE: When you say "What are you being?-- Does that mean you're BEING your emceeing?"
KRS-ONE: Yes! But what I'm being is hip-hop..THAT'S what's really gettin' respect on your block...
GREENIE: Hip-Hop !?!?
KRS-ONE: That's right-- Hip-Hop... Last of the human skills..
GREENIE: Ahhhh... Hip-Hop..
KRS-ONE: Let's go further... with this pre-meditated worder...Kris Parker, the teacher-- I know you hearda... All the sciences, makin' instruments out of appliances, showin' you what self-reliance is...
GREENIE: ...but whose rhyme this is? Why's whack emcees in our face like sinuses? You positive like plus, Kris, and they minuses-- Ideas are going through my mind like a Catscan...I'm not a white emcee who pretends to be a Black man...I was writing rhymes when they invented Pac-Man..now my rhyme'z is tight like that suit on Batman...You kept it real, Kris, you came out as a rosta; I'm comin' out controversial...talkin' 'bout Schvartze....Rappers are whack today...but I don't need to dis' one... My rhyme style is THIS one....
