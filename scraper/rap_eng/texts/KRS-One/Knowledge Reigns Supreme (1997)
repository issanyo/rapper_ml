[Chorus: KRS-ONE]
The word I bring to you today
Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme
You got no time to joke and play
Cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme
While others play that game for fame
Their concepts bring you stress and strain
But blessed are those that know my name
Is Knowledge Reigns Supreme

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Why do I call myself God when I'm speaking
People always ask me this question when I'm teaching
What you gotta understand is that Kris don't exist
The only existence is God consciousness
In God consciousness is what exists is Kris
Your ego tells you that you doing all this
You a Mister, a Mister professional lyricist
I get rid of this forever, It only gets better
Kris from the universe; you can never sever
Cause there is no Kris, only the universe remember
Go a little deeper you can check me
My whole campaign is about living life correctly
But don't respect me respect the universe
Tt's her verse that I disperse

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
I'll bring you out the cave
And change how you behave
Everything is really particles and waves
Not to mention your visual extension is ruled by perception
Guiding your every direction
If you really want money your mentality much switch
If you really wanna be rich you gotta act like you're rich
You can't act like a bitch if you wanna be a lady
You can't get the gravy if you're sitting around lazy
You can't be in the hustle if you ain't looking for trouble
You can't be single if you know you're really double
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
You can do it, yeah
We can do it, yeah
We the best
Don't worry about the cards that they dealt ya'
It's real I percieved myself out the shelter
Every day and night seeing myself rock the mic'
Lyrics tight, getting paid right for my mental sight
Richer not poorer, expanding my aura
To attract more'a positive energy

[Chorus x1]


[Background talking: Unknown]
Uhh, one two my man Kris
Flip the style you do it like this

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Hard to forget it
The culture thats inbedded check it
It's energetic
But people really want me deaded
But Kris won't let it
The same thing that you read I read it
My hair is dreaded
But hip-hop yes you must respect it
We must direct it and use it positively
So these skeptics can learn our mathetics
Like metric I said it
I'm about to shed it
Why don't you check me like your credit
You still don't get it
You twist it like ???? ????
Rappers nowadays sound so pathetic
Yo let me said it
Although my presentation is derided
And hypothetic
My genetics is highly poetic and athletic
But still some don't get it
The paparazzi life is all synthetic
The balancing of the mind is what's authentic
The total body is ultra-magnetic

[Outro talking: KRS-ONE]
There's no need to be afraid
Open your mind
Do your knowledge
Do your knowledge
Stop studying your knowledge
And do your knowledge
