Yeah, yeah
There was a time when I could not find
The Spirit of God beyond the mind
In retrospect, the intellect is blind

It makes me think that I'm the reason
For all that's mine
Even this rhyme, I'm inclined to believe
Is from me, instead of being received
This is how we're deceived

How am I more than dust
When it's Your love that animates us?
Forever I will trust
Your love is better than lust
You live forever in us
