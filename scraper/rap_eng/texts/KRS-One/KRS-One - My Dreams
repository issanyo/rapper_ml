[Intro]
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 1]
30 years back on the scuffle with 'em weapons
Hunger in the aisle, we can roll in a second
In the real [? 0:17], you must be respected
One way in the entrance is the exit
You ain't getting out unless you wreck shit
Bullies'n'Black hoodies, man, you ain't have to be in some next shit
Every other person had a knife or a box cutter
Every other song you heard ("WHAT MOTHERFUCKER?")
This is where I grew up at, with my first songs blew up that
Where I first got my new crown gap, but you know that
It's just every once in a while, you do go back

[Bridge]
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 2]
I'm manifesting
My team, my mean, my scene, my dreams
No sleep in the hood, [1:08 ?]
This scene's my dreams with dreams just dreams
In 1985, my means were so lean
Rappers back then were so crisp and clean
How can I ever be heard or even just seen
I'm [1:21 ?], no money, nose's runny, funny
But, indeed, knowledge reigns even when it's sunny
Just when I thought my dream hadn't stopped
In-walk DJ [1:29 ?]
Just when I thought my dream hadn't finished
Teddy Ted's special case said ("Let's spin this!")
Just when I thought that I couldn't build there
My visions and my dreams were fulfilled right there
I told you, we'll be here forever if we're still here

[Bridge]
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

[Verse 3]
See it in your mind's eye
Take your vision high, high
Worry 'bout no wise guy
Telling you, you can't fly
They're living a lie, lie
Telling people blah, blah
All they do is cry, cry
So when they cry, why stop
Turn up the [2:20 ?]
Never be a shy guy
Sail on the deck of your intellectual eye, eye
Captain, help your own destiny
Your dream is like hearing this song
It was meant to be
Like this is the vision you was meant to see
Don't be scared, get prepared, now you see
I'm manifesting ("My dream")

("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
("My dream")
