You an adult now, you gotta start living like one
Like if you an emcee, you can't wait for me man

[Verse 3: Raphi]
Give you the gun, yeah right, why should I?
Had enough of this life, how could I?
Live another day, live it away
It's all display, come on now really, why would I?
It ain't working man, I'm worthless
I'm a good guy gone berserk
And nobody cares, everyone's smirking
[?] for me and my girlfriend
[?] my girlfriend
It's better this way like veterans say
The world just don't deserve him
Final curtain, yeah you heard him
Never hurt that no one will miss me
I did them [?] but they diss me
Respect never cut the check so I did my dirt tryin' to get filthy
For feeling guilty, choking on two feet of milky
But that's just how Cali build me
Move on with a new song tryin' to make it, will he?
The clever kid never did
I readily weathered it moving the subject and predicate willfully
Doing it skillfully, kept it real but it never made a mil for me
Paid the bills? Yeah right, man it made more
And it wasn't what I came up in the game for
Big Shame became one of my name
Whether money ever coming to me [?] open the door
But I'm tired of knocking, on my last option
I'm stopping, never got it popping
So it's no longer fun
I got my gun, I'm done
