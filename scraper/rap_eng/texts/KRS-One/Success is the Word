[Intro]
Money, Money, money, money...
[Human beat box begins]
SUCCESS... [Gilligan's Island theme]
SUCCESS
[Imitating Mr. Howell/Jim Backus] "Hey Gilligan, my boy... Success is the word!"

[Verse 1: KRS-One, Levi 167, Scott La Rock]
I'm going to travel by jet to the south of France
Hit the fine ladies; put them in a trance
So party people; say what you want to do?
Dining on my yacht in Paris too
With the finest clothes and drive a big car
Sun roof, Rolls Royce, and the caviar
Fine wine, champagne, Don Perignon
Party like crazy to the break of dawn
Up and down and on and on
The party won't stop until we break the law
In my hundred room castle, in Madrid
And walking through the night with my man LC

To be a success above the rest you got to be the best
Able to pass the most vicious test
You got to put it all together, and keep it cool
'cause with success comes money too
You're gonna take your time to get it right
And work real hard both day and night
You better punch that clock up on the wall
'cause with success, you'll have a ball
Money, fame, and fortune too
All these things are here for you
If you take your time, relax your mind
Put it all together instead of wiggling your behind
You say you want to be something and have a good life
But how you gonna do it if you don't think twice
You see your mama gives you love so strong and true
She's always by your side trying to help you
She said what you can conceive you will achieve
(But in the butt) you will receive
Riches, wealth, and so much fame
You got to pay some dues if you play this game
SUCCESS!

A Mercedes Benz and lots of friends
A condominium, I'm having so much fun
A big bank account, and so much clout
I want to be the one to turn it out

Well I want to be the king of the playboy swing
Have diamond and furs and all the jazzy things
Hang out with Liz, travel round the world
I even have a stable of those fly girls
King in [?] of my chalet
Down for the sun in Montego Bay
Or would you prefer Miami Beach?
It's not that hard to reach
By boat, by car, or private plane
With cash money, you can go insane

[Chorus]
Success!
Success!
Success!
Success!

[Outro]
S-U-C-C-E-S-S That's the way you spell success!
