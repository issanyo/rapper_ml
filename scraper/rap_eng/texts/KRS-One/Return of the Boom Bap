[Intro]
Boom Bap Original Rap
Boom Bap Original Rap
See how it sounds(bo!) a little unrational(bo!)*4

[Verse 1]
Now bad boy squad and bad boy crew
Everything I do, I do just for you
Another silly sucker wants the champion belt
But like a microwave, these days I make em melt
Return Of The Boom Bap means just that
It means return of the real hard beats and real rap
The ladies in the place like it just like that
I'm a around the way guy with a baseball cap
You know my style, you know my name
I'm chillin' at the top, but I'm still the same
I never crossed over, never went pop
You know Krs will give you real hip hop so

[Hook]
See how it sounds(bo!) a little unrational(bo!) [x4]

[Verse 2]
People always callin me a top celebrity
Cause when I'm on the mic
I like to speak freely
You hear me chattin' lyric but Im not an MC
A one poetic member of the crew B.D.P
I looked around the nation but I simply couldn't find
Another entertainer with a rhyme like mine
I pick up the mic and I tear up the phone
At this point in the party I should be left alone
But uh-oh uh-oh I've come to show
A brand new flow, is the flow wack? NO!
Listen to the pro, come to the show in a b-boy stance
Bogle in the dance
Bogle and a bogle and a bogle in the party
Here's a little stylee, come an wake up everybody
Boom bap original rap
Boom bap, boom bap original rap
Refreshin' when you hear it hard rap is all that so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bogle in the dance, bogle in the dance
Bogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party
Bogle in the dance, bogle in the dance
Bogle in a, bogle in a, bogle in the party
On and on to the PM Dawn
I buck two shots and you squad is gone
You add a little street in your r-a-p
But never do you wanna challenge B.D.P
Cause smashin' up a crew, one-two is the least
When a sucka wants to battle that just gets me geesed
I never backed down from to an MC feud
Never on stage KRS got booed
Stayed hardcore never changed my attitude
I got the hip-hop juice for the hip-hop food
I eat when I drink, an I drink when I eat
When I speak, what I speak, what I speak is not weak
Now Boogie-down, boogie down, boogie down produc
With the buck buck buck buck buck buck BUCK!
Throw ya hands high in the sky
Wave em around, cause I get down
Down to the nitty, to the nitty, to the gritty
Peace to all the hardcore kids in the city so

[Hook]

[Outro]
