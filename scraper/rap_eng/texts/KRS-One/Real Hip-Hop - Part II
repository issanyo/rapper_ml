[KRS-One]
Hah!  They not ready, uhh uhh
Set it off, South Bronx
Set it off, uhh, check it

The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there

It's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo
Steppin out the limo, KRS-One, gettin in you
From the get-go kiddo throw em out the window
Flip em like a nickel
Peep the hottest single
He'll sink them like the S.S. Minnow
That same kid that rocks the Benz rocks the Pinto
Watch my signal, I rock the rap game like Nintendo
Hey diddle, diddle, get played now like a fiddle
I watch you wiggle, in front of the audience that was fickle
Now you can't make a nickle, the sour pickle you are
KRS-One, ninety-seven superstar
I got one thing to say and let me make this clear
Everywhere, now throw your hands in the air

The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, throw your hands in the air!

[Mic Vandalz]
Yo, been rockin rooftops, knahmsayin?
Internat', yaknahmsayin?
KRS, vandalizin, yaknahmsayin?  With the Mic Vandalz
Boogie Down, Uptown, yaknahmsayin?
It's dope, check it out

[KRS-One]
When I ain't doin a show, or bringin all the money in
Or at the studio, or home studyin
I'm checkin out Funkmaster Flex on cassette
As he wrecks turntable sets with many subjects
Huff now that's the Blastmaster connects, the larynx
To a high-tech mic set, you get what you get
Tech and Sway, index of singles is complex
On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix
Hip-Hop I reads it, and mark your album incompleted
I seen it, saw it, back in eighty-five
Platinum rappers yo that can't rock live
Their mental facilities, lack the ability
For lyric agility -- battle?  You're killin me

The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here
The real hip-hop, throw your hands in the air!
The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is it over here?
The real hip-hop, yo it's over there
The real hip.. now throw your hands in the air!

[Mic Vandalz]
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)

Aiyyo I'm breakin, in this rap thing, I've been waitin
Ready for the world, rude like awakening
Homo sapien, ? ? rock every stadium
Scholars and players, here to Las Vegas
Embrace the papers, land of money makers
Brothers hate us cause the brothers ain't us

Yo yo, from coast to coast I'mma overdose you and BDP you
And Kris-Kross your mind, wouldn't wanna be you
A Uptown thing, world premier
Throw your hands in the air baby it's on
How many MC's wanna get they rep torn?
From Joe to Cage and mics in my juvenile days, I abuse
The mic get lifted, the crowd gets amused

I got next.. you lose!
