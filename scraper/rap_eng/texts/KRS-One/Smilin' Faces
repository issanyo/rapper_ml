[Shock G]
Yeah.. aiyyo Kris tell 'em what's up yo

[KRS]
Yo, yo yo, one two!
Comin at you live and direct (that's right)
Digital Underground kid, you know what's up

[Shock G]
Aiyyo Kris is chillin, Shock G's chillin
What more can we say, about the village
The real killers, chillin in the Whi.. I mean the not RIGHT house
Want me to be they lab white mouse
The smile of seedy greedies, deprivin the needies, breakin treaties
Overseas wildin while they profilin on the TV's
Some of 'em cool though.. see I like that nigga Bill
Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down
Now let's break down the meaning of a smile
Is it happiness and blissfulness, well let's go down the list
You got the real deal for real-real smile
You got the phony they don't know me let me hide my feel smile
The dumb embarassed smile
The ooh she look delicious, yo that girl is lavish smile (uh-huh)
Then you got the shake your head nah black, that shit was whack smile
The across the bar, yeah it's cool, we can hit the sack smile
The crack smile, the caught in the act smile
The over my shoulder caught you schemin on me delayed react smile
The smile you're really glad to see when it comes round
The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down
You glance back, your man who packs that once in a while
Gives you the - oh I'm strapped, do your thing, baby I got your back smile

[Chorus: KRS-One]
Smilin faces, sometimes
Pretend, to be your friend
Smilin faces, show no traces
Of the evil, that lurks within

[KRS-One]
Whaddya think I joke?  Whaddya think I sniff coke?
Me a wild t'ing like Tone Loc, you better be dope
When the soundclash erupt, rev up, step up to the cut
Whassup?  I show up to blow up and leave the spot TO' UP
You know what?  I'ma go nut, but you know what?  Yeah, so what!
It's the regular, when you checkin the, one that perfected the
Smilin faced people posin as your equal
Knowin they wanna beat you defeat you and eat you, but they greet you
With peace and love, not with the piece but the dove
Not beneath but above, now the cheek give a hug
Snug, no grudge, 'til you turn your back and learn the facts
Called learnin truth, the tree is only KNOWN by its fruits
These smilin faces, in many places, sometime they racist
Sometime they sexist, sometime they want your Lexus
Sometime they be your family members remember
Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fella, with them you thought
You'd never ever sever, but they was two-faced - it happens
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever forever
Let me make this relationship better, if you real stay real
Be real, the truth we got to treasure, not these

[Chorus]

[Shock G] And they be lurkin
[KRS] You know what's up, ha!
[KRS] KRS-One, Shock Gigga!
[Shock G] That's me baby
[KRS] HA HA.. word

[Shock G]
Yo, just let the beat breathe
Uhh.. yeah..
Cause they be lurkin
Never trust a big butt and a smile baby
Uhh.. keep it goin, ah keep it goin
Yo Kris that's peace baby (uh-huh)
They know the deal
Smile ain't nuttin but an upside down frown (word)
Never trust a big butt and a smile
