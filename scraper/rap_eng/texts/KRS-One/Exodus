Yeah
What they know about this
KRS
You know what's up
Let's roll

Back on the block boy
Look out for the cops boy
Stop boy
Punks got the drop boy
(?)
Hiphop nuts
Boy that wacks the nemesis
Mayhem, Noisia, KRS
Aha, Exodus

Trying to escape
To create the hunger
Is build from state to state
KRS don't need a break
Politicians always too late
From Atlanta all the way to Holland (yo)

I think my people need a break

All my people put your hands up right now
We're on a mission
You know what time it is

We rollin' out
Mayhem, Noisia, KRS
We want da Exodus

You know what it is
I wanna see everybody movin'
Everybody movin'

We want da E
X
O
D U S

Yeah
Let's roll
