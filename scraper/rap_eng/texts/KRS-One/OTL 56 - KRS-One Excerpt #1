KRS-One: This line "suicide it's a suicide buda bye bye" this was a Jamaican Patois lyric. Very common in Jamaican MC-ing, the style "suicide it's a suicide". I'm telling the other MC on the opponent that you're basically killing yourself by coming to challenge KRS-One. I did this on the Just Ice album, Kool & Deadly, and it somehow caught on I guess. A lot of people liked the flow of it, so when I heard it a few times in a people's choruses, scratched a few times in peoples' songs, and even said in peoples' lyrics - I love it all. I loved it all. Anybody that knows me knows - you could use anything of KRS-One's. If you can somehow innovate what I did or just use what I did to better yourself? I'm all for it
