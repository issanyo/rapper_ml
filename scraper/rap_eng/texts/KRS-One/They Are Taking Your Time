Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind


Eleven million people unemployed and I'm one of them
I grew up with the rats and roaches I had fun with them
Fly sneaks' and fine clothes, I had none of them
But when I came to MC rhymes I had a ton of them
People tell me go get a job, I would run from them
I saw the workforce and work was no fun for them
No beach, no melanin, no Sun for them
With slave robbing bosses why would I come under them?

So at 7 am you wake up from sleep
At 7 am I wake up and take a leak
At 7:05 you got slippers on your feet
At 7:07 I'm going right back to sleep
At 7:15 you thinking about today's meeting
At 7:30 am, my friend, I'm still sleeping
At 7:45, your phone start beeping
Old text messages from yesterday's meeting

8 am you leaving it's freezing
You're feeling unworthy trying to get the work before 9:30
9:45 I'm just turning over
9:45 man, you looking over your shoulder
Here comes the boss looking for that folder
And you know within your folder, you didn't meet your quota
Now 11 o'clock's to bone ya', your boss says where's the folder?
And you feel like you a goner

Well, you simply gotta make it up
But 11 o'clock ops KRS just waking up
Linger in the bed to about 11:30
Spit a morning  prayer, I hope heaven heard me
Stand up at about 12 o'clock, you on your lunch break
I'm just eating breakfast vegetarian cupcakes
1 o'clock, you back at your desk, back at the office
Back into stress, your desk is a mess


Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind


You doing your best but your best ain't enough
You wanna do less but less, makes it rough
It's 101 in the public and private sector
Either way I'm giving a conference at 4 pm a lecture
Topic, while I check my other appointments
Cause hip hop is a culture in lifetime employment
See, back in the days,  to avoid getting jerk
We was told to go to college in case rap didn't work

Now today, not to be so hurt
You better know how to rap in case your degree don't work
Man, you better get the lesson, and stop stressing
MC and a DJ and a high paying profession
So if you need to - don't let them deceive you
You ain't got to believe me, it's time you believe you!


Listen to this rhyme, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
Rise up and shine, they taking your time
It's like you're in prison when you don't use your mind
