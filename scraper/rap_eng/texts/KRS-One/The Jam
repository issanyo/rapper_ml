[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
Yeah!
Get off the tip if you're not legitimate
We were chatting reggae back in '86
Boogie Down Productions get the party cranking
DJ KRS now, with the Shabba Ranking
Taking titles, breaking idols
The lyrics I chat in your head are like vitals, so eat it up!
Fresh styles we manifest
Sydney Twain, Specialist, Shabba, and KRS....ONE
In Japan, it's "ichiban"
KRS-"Ichiban", number 1 rap song
You try to do it, and it turns out all wrong
You know why?
'Cause all the others specialize in plastic
Boogie Down Productions specialize in classics
Classical Hip-Hop, Reggae, Dancehall music
Industries rocked by BDP
So girls throw your hand in the air
Put 'em down, turn around, and move your bo-dy-dy-dy

Now listen Shabba, you know you run Reggae non-stop
And KRS-ONE is terrorizing Hip-Hop
