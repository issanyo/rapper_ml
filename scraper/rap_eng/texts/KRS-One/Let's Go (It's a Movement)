[KRS-One]
Yeah Ungh Yeah Ungh!
Yeah Yeah Yeah!

We bout to do it like this
Word up all the way from the Bronx
LBC what's up?
Wooo Let's do this

Chorus 2X:
It's a movement
(Let's go, here we go!)
I'mma prove it
(Let's go, here we go!)
KRS-One
(Let's go, here we go!)
Warren G, Lil' AI
(Let's go, here we go!)

[KRS-One]
Radio waves making you behave like a slave
So many ways to enhance what you crave
Microchips and optic clips have you licking your lips
With your eyes fixed on tits and fast whips
It's funny how we call cars whips
We slave for it
How many times were you beaten by they tricks
You looking at an eclipse
Faded dark spot in front of the light
Shut your eyes quick
International KRS passing through
When you spell Hip-Hop the H is always capital
Here's what we have to do
It ain't hard to see
KRS, Lil' AI, Warren G
That's the power
Ain't no calming me
An open hour
They see the god in me
Pardon me
In hip-hop, your heart is free
What you telling me, KRS, LBC?

Chorus (2x)

[Warren G]
South Bronx, South Side Bronx
Boogie Down to my G-Funk Productions
Mic check, one two
Move a little somethin
Something with my peeps
Hip-hop declaration of peace
Street movement (let's go, here we go!)
Let's keep it music (let's go, here we go!)
I'mma prove it (let's go, here we go!)
If you've got beef with Hip-Hop (let's go, here we go!)
International incomes so we're in the suite
Watching Ichiro hit in runs, life is sweet
I take it back where I'm from
Knowledge rules supreme over nearly everyone hmph
It's a shame how we caught up in the material lifestyle
And our next generation living wild
It's time for discipline time for listening
To this declaration of Hip-Hop christening

Chorus 2X

[Lil' AI]
My name is L-I-L AI, I'm Lil' AI, yo
(raps in Japanese rest of verse)
