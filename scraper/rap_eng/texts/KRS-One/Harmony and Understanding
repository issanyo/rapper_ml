When the mooooon is in the seventh house
And Jupiter, aliiiiigns with Mars
And Pete, will guide the planet
And love will steal the stars
Right now we're living in the age of Aquarius
The age of Aquariussssssssssss
Aquariusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!
(Aquariusssssssssssss)

[KRS-One]
Yeah, ah, yeah, ah
Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more need for superstition
All your living dreams are visions
Mystic crystal revelations
And the mind's true li-ber-aaa-tion

[unknown singer]
Aquariusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!
(Aquariusssssssssssss)
