[Verse 1: KRS-One]
What is the difference between the palm and the fist?
When the palm is open, does the fist not exist?
Or when the fist is clinched, ready to harm
Does it mean that you no longer have a palm?
No palm and fist are part of the hand
But even deeper, they part of what you understand
There is no palm or fist
Your perception of your hand movements is calling it this
Palm and fist doesn't exist
But they do, when your hands is used like this by you
So try to look at words, while you cookin' the herbs
Look at the birds, is that a bird?
A B.I.R.D.S? Is that what it is?
Is that what's building his nest?
That's not all of it, a B.I.R.D.S is what we calling it
But really, what is a bird really?
Look past the word symbols to see the bird clearly
Hear me, if you never name yourself
You are forever subject to everyone else
Your name is your nature
It makes you lower or greater
I'm not a hater, but you'll see later
So back to the palm and the fist, overstand
The palm and the fist are symbols of the hand
It's what the hand is doing, not what it is
The doing is the effect that causes what it is
So what is it, when you live by the definitions of what others give
Living history of what others live
You're like a kid, I mean a goat
Being led to the slitting of your own throat
Wow, for many there's no hope
It seems like they up ships creep without a boat
