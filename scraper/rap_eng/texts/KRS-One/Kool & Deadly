[Spoken Intro]
Okay, here we go again
We fucked up the first time, and now we’re gonna do it over
Whoa, I’m gonna go home and shit and listen to this
That’s DMX on the beatbox
Ah yeah, back again y’all for your pleasure
Sir Vicious Just-Ice, the dangerous gangster of hip-hop
My man, the original and human DMX on the beatbox for your pleasure
What we gon’ do right here is get real Kool & Deadly, you know what I’m sayin’
All this I’m saying gon’ get edited out, so it don’t matter anyway
1, 2, 3, hit it

[Verse 1]
Listen up, real close, party people
My lyrics are fatal, my voice is illegal
“To be or not to be” that is your question
Influence not allowed, no type of seduction
When I’m rhyming, I stand alone
No group or two on the megaphone
Lyricist lunatic MC like psycho
Not mega but I meant to say micro
Acting ill is not for Rhea in the desert
Now call Pilar or Medina
I have a goal in every dream I chase
Boost a level on the treble, pump the bass in the place
So, just clap and have a good time
Enjoy yourself and hear Just rhyme
Any troubles at all, I’ll solve them
Be it small or large or any kind of problem
Lay your head on the speaker, my words will reach ya
If you’re stupid, take a lesson, I’ll teach ya
That’s my job ‘cause I’m duly sworn
To build on the mic, make knowledge born
For those who cannot understand my swift swift rhythm
Don’t try to mock my words, ‘cause I will diss them
Think the first verse is fresh? Stick around for a while
Peep it out, everybody, my Kool & Deadly style

Ah yeah, DMX get live
Just-Ice, rock on, Kool & Deadly

[Verse 2]
I’m deadly as a mantis, could hurt you like a tumor
Just-Ice is my name and it’s a New York rumor
Mantronix programmin’, while I examine
Beats move swift and highly advancin’
Deep rough sound in my gangster voice
Hard rock response makes it first choice
Pat myself on the back, congratulate my physical
Don’t get stupid, this point is critical
It doesn’t matter if you’re beat or flowing
Not where you’re from but where you’re going
Getting paid with cash I spent
The hardest rock like dry cement
Just dry, no, I didn’t say powdered
I know you’re wondering how did I finish that very last sentence
You listening, misfits? Stop biting or I will diminish
You…and your entire crew
By the way, what’s left for me to do?
But blow off some smoke, let some steam off my chest
Digest all the rest and mess up the best
A session or energy, the power of thought
Tranquilize any size to bring ‘em to a halt
Not mentioning a diss in this
Baby, because my beat floating funky, please don’t pause
Continue rockin’ and your woppin’, you do it smooth
Listen to my mathematics, proceed to move
Elevatin’ to a level that’s good enough for me
Increasing my equal to a higher degree
Sit back, relax, enjoy the tune
It’s enough music here to fill up the room
Stop acting wild, show some tranquility
Back to the beat, admire my ability
To rock on the mic and make things right
So biters don’t and get me uptight
So I could sing my song all night long
If there’s a pause in the beat, Just-Ice goes strong
Control your body, uplift your spirits
Applaud and cheer the undisputed lyrics
I know you want to rock and enjoy my party
Dance, be cool, don’t irk nobody
Think the second verse is fresh? Stick around for a while
Peep it out, everybody, my Kool & Deadly style

Yeah mon, that’s real big
Gon’ moshitup now, salute, salute, original DJ

[Verse 3]
When I abate all aches, I will rock a brain
My intention is dissin’ as well as disdain
You clearly eating rhymes, claiming you’re legit
I nullify, rescind, vitiate, prohibit
All that come within my cipher I’ll haunt
Release my wrath and relate and flaunt
Thought and want, expedite then taunt
Punitiveness and must, now my anger is launched
Strong and silent, fast and far
Won’t miss with this at the far reservoir
Subjugate at will before I reach a preacher
Make amends and use us whether straight or oblique
Non-biased to all, but things are really rushin’
By the time they get the answer, I changed the question
Your records ain’t jack shit, I’m like elastic
Mad ‘cause mine are hits and yours ain’t plastic
I’m the gangster of hip-hop, you better consider it
Slightly grease monkey, imbecile, a damn idiot
Comparison to me, like a plug out of socket
More cash in my mouth than you got in your pocket
And flexible I am, strong and courageous
Incessant, and terse, and very audacious
I predict or see it’s live and select
Conquer, control, rhymes better abject
Excluding my foe when lacking a stand
To serve a T is the lane, erosion my path
Not a treat, but worse, I’m metal
If fractioned by you, it’s a score I settle
I latch on your neck like the dog I’m ropin’
I’m far from fame ‘cause my lyrics are dope and
A message I send very omnipotent
Powerful, persuasive, very influential
I chill, won’t hit you no harder
Every time you see Just-Ice, you know I hit larger
Reaching for my goals, whether lower or higher
Yo, you can’t rap, you lollipop liar

[Outro dialogue]
