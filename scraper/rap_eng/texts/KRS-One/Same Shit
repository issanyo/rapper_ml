[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Its time to kick ass

Yeah
Same shit
Yeah
Same shit
Wake up

[Verse 1]
Listen
Terrorists and governments play the same game
Banks and big business take the same blame
Open your brain
The Klan and the cops are the same
Slave quarters, blocks, and prison blocks are the same
They only separated by name
Overrated by fame
What's in a name?
Our colonists is the same
People can't really see it
Because they're blocked by the name
But really Nazi Germany and your black is the same
Look
Wall Street and Main Street
Really that's the same street
Drug talk, corporate talk
Really that's the same speak
Boom bap, boom bip
Really that's the same beat
A throne or a chair in your home
Really that's the same seat
I wrote and recorded this album in the same week
California and Barcelona
Its got the same heat
I walk the same street
Put no trust in the game
Good cop, bad cop
They one and the same
Same shit

[Bridge]
You know
Listen

[Verse 2]
Rapper and politicians they want the same thing
To kneel before their master and kiss the same ring
But Solomon and Selassi them are the same king
So from (?) I spit the same swing
Ding ding ding, there goes the bell
I'm the same as heaven, these dudes the same as hell
I'm the same as the plane at liftoff, fly
They the same as a rip-off, a lie
I remind you
Don't let the criminal mind blind you
Instead let the spiritual mind find you
See I'm you
Just twenty years ahead
Its to your advantage to hear KRS-ONE and rewind what he said
Its the same shit

[Bridge]
Its the same shit
Look

[Verse 3]
Drug cartels is what sells the medical
Drug spots and drug stores are identical
Y'all need to wake up and join with the woke folk
Ignorance is only gonna keep you with them broke folk
KRS is on some cool shit
I ain't nothing to fool with
I teach more kids than the school gets
Game over, stupid
Its like we at the eight ball corner pocket
And I got the pool stick
You can say whatever, me I'm living better and better
Getting cheddar, out in Greece getting the feta
Up in Catalonia only eating paella
Up in Italy getting bread, call it bruscetta
I spit
They cruise cars, I cruise ships
Democrat and Republican, that's the same shit
Its the same shit
