KRS-One: You know, MC Shan is the beginning of my career. If it wasn't for MC Shan, KRS-One would not exist. I start that way whenever I'm talking about MC Shan. Whenever I'm talking about MC Shan, I have to start off with: he is the creation and start of my career. And literally, because, you know, when you have lines - and I'm actually thinking of the full song, many people tell me this that this style is kinda different... It was his style that I was doing, and many people don't know that. I mean, many people do know that, but if your hip hop begins in the 90's, for instance, you may think that the style that I'm doing on the South Bronx is actually my style. It's not. It's a parody of MC Shan's style. And I'm sort of mocking or mimicking his style so in a lot of ways you can say that KRS-One's actual style was MC Shan's style. I kinda bit his style and started my style. That's something I would never say in public
