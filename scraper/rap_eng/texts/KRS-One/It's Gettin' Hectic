[Verse 1]
Times are critical, although I kick the metaphysical
Sometimes my rhymes flow kind of political
All the real B-boys make noise
Here comes the bomb yo, please stay calm yo, see I'm though
Happy chappy wind up and slap me one hitter, critter
Each year, I'm bigger, thicker, lyrics moving quicker
It's true, I got more styles up there
So I'll put it together and come out with an album every single year
Listen here, something new is going on
So of course Blast Master says it faster in a song
As you noticed the Bush Administration
Dealt with foreign affairs through the United Nations
In the UN, the Europeans have seniority
Yet in the world of nations, whites are the minority
This doesn't balance out for no nation
Check it, the UN is like the world plantation
There's more dark skin force than white forces
But Europeans are raping their resources
To be more specific while I'm rhyming
Resources mean oil, gold, minerals, diamonds
Anything to make the European riches a minority
They need this but there's one glitch
They concentrated much on international
But not enough on the thinking of the national
So while the Bush administration was outside
Yes the Clinton administration will be inside
Anything that affects the way you think
In music, in television, in writing, or out of the shrink
Cause if you start bugging within the nation
That messes up with what goes on in other nations
Not only Blacks but whites are starting to see the hypocrisy
Cause they're fed up with the economy
They're not uniting Europe for Europeans
They're uniting Europe to enslave the world of human beings
So rise up, there's little time to dance
To the youth in Great Britain, U.S., and France
Never forget, you might have to set it
Yo, things are getting hectic

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
If I can make you think there's something's wrong in my song
Then my song is a threat to what's going on
We've had years of free debate
Now they're gonna clean out rap in every single state
You'll see less and less on your television
And you'll see more and more violence and tongue kissing
Before I leave this point, I'll give you more
Explicit lyrics stickers is supported by Tipper Gore
Al Gore's wife, a White House resident
Vice president to the president, I think you're getting it
Rap music has the most influence yet, you bet
So now, it's a military threat
Anything that changes how you feel changes how you act
That's a threat, and that's rap
Racist mothers and fathers hate Black
But their children be chilling with Black kicking that rap
More and more White kids feel what we feel
You'll see more White kids with a mic on the wheels of steel
And that ain't the global plan
I haven't even discussed Japan
Japanese youth love Black youth
In Japan, there's no racists in the DJ booth
Just truth, screaming from the microphone
So the object is to shut down the head right here at home
Never forget it, you might have to set it
Yo, things are getting hectic
