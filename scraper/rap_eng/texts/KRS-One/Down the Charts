You can't still worry about the charts position
It's the heart that you're missing
It's the art that you're missing

Just a little something to hold you over
The Kris'Style album on the way, Word Up!

When you're number one, everybody come
But when you drop to two, everybody still with you
But when you drop to three, everybody want to see
But when you drop to four, everybody still adore
But when you drop to five, people will help you to strive
But when you drop to six, you selling every mix
But when you drop to seven, people start guessing
But when you drop to eight, people hesitate
But when you drop to nine, it's when you start to find
That when you drop to ten, you start to lose your friends

When you drop to eleven, you record stops selling
When you drop to twelve, it's everyone for themselves
So when you drop to thirteen, you stop working
When you drop for fourteen, no more self esteem
You drop to fifteen, because you live then you seen
When you drop to sixteen, you're now out the scene
When you drop to seventeen, you see things you've never seen
That when you drop to eighteen, you know what it means
So you drop to nineteen, on then to twenty
At nineteen you lose your honey, at twenty your money to a Playboy Bunny

At twenty-one things ain't funny
At twenty-two, you don't know what to do
So you hit twenty-three, you look for security
So you drop to twenty-four, no more can you endure
When you drop to twenty-five, at the bottom you've arrive
When you drop to twenty-six, you're on old-school mix
When you drop to twenty-seven, they tell you to stop step in
When you drop to twenty-eight, you start to meditate
When you drop to twenty-nine, you expand your mind
When you drop to thirty, you see it was all dirty
When you drop to thirty-two, and it occurs to you
When you drop to thirty-three, now you can see
It's all about skill and the love for the art
Not who's above and who's bellow in the chart
You gotta look in the heart, it's there where you start
I and Hip-Hop are never ever apart, Word!
