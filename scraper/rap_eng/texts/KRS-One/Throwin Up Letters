[Intro]
Uhu , Uhu
Krs in the building , my man Longevity
This is good , let's do this
All my graff writers whadup
Keep moving , that's right !  (C'mon ! C'mon !)

[Verse 1: KRS-One]
This a passion , can't stop it's nagging
[?] braggin' , Paint rackin' I'm baggin'
Can't stop dragging so I'm rhyming, saggin
Packed in the magnum we dissapear like Aladdin
I'm dreaming about stabbing [?]
No acting , these toys are straight slappin'
Let's get it crackin' with red , brown and black and
Shoutout to Cope2 , doll and joey crackhead
Way before rapping , Krs was graffing
Laughing , throwin up letters without asking
Long lasting my passion, thanks for asking
Bombing , burning pieces , throwing up , tagging
Time for some action , acrobatic [?]
All of art work my heart works no relaxin
Now I took graff and combined it with rapping
Instead of taggin now I'm straight up autographing

[Hook: Rakaa]
I'm a star on the wall , my autograph (longevity)
I'm a star on the wall (x3)
I'm a star on the wall , my autograph

[Verse 2: Rakaa]
Black kitty, Blackbook, Black pack, Backpack
Master with the whole made skinny and the fatcap
Night rider , Sky rider , aerosolid rapcat
594 [?] pack
Colors like ice T
You know I got cans , build [?] running from the cops man
Feet woking high speed movin' up the block man
And Sting put on them red light like Roxanne
Subway yard , Spraycan art , Wildstyle , Style wars how to make them off
We battle to change their name or take their yard
Take they paint and fame and break they heart
I [?] specialists take flight
Dilated E.T.S
Sketch to the field , outline and highlight/highlife
I'm here to devastate I'm [?]

[Hook]
