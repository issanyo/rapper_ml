[Intro]
Just-Ice!
BDP Posse!

[Verse 1]
I walk around the town, keepin' to myself
Conceivin' new thoughts to sustain my wealth
Keep my eyes opened wide, my ears pierced for sound
I'm searchin' for a beat like a hungry, rhymin' hound
'Cause I'm potent and vicious and the most crushin'
Sustain any strain, keep you all guessin'
I'm a voyager for rhythm, a pirate for a rhyme
My voice is the vessel, now my mind must climb
To a much higher plane, that's my domain
Devastate and fascinate all but no strain
Too reliable to reason, a victim of sense
Wise up to the season and don't be dense
Been rhymin' for years and now's the time
Not two, three, four, five years but nine
To brag is not my bag but I must say this
You can say Just-Ice or say Justice!

DMX, rock on!
Huh!

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna talk junk or sound displeased
But your crew is the lettuce, boy, you're the cheese
Got a knack for being rude, I love to diss
That's why I'm not nice and call Sir Vicious
It's Just-Ice, that's right, I'm rocking long
With my man KRS—can you put the record back on?
Be alert, you jerks, do you hear what I meant?
The consequence is non-lenient, very intense
Captivate and control your very body and soul
Don't dare stop me now, I'm on the roll
Givin' credit to the man who beat ya best
BDP Blastmaster KRS
He's the master of the beat, the wizard, a machine
Connoisseur of a rhythm with sound that's keen
Combined with Justice to create
The crew of the year, 1988
In fact, it's like that, 'cause it's right and exact
Monstrosity of force with power that's packed
To destroy or disperse, or even invert
But the bottom line is this, that you're gonna get hurt
Don't get in our way, you better watch your step
Just-Ice and KRS got big respect
So for all of the people who are not sure
Sir Vicious Just-Ice is back for more!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm the devastating force when it comes to a rhyme
And if you never beared witness, well, now is the time
Your eyes will glisten, your ears better listen
Chastise for now for everybody I’m dissin’
For other MCs, yes, I wrote this
If you can't see well, then hear this notice
Now if you wanna battle me, you better take heed
With razor sharp rhymes that will make you bleed
As you’re betting, double debt and you find it hard to pay
Also regret the deficit, this one’s going to cost you
Much more than a little or few
'Cause now you bit off more than you can chew
Got a tantalyzin' style, take your mind on tour
Watch Just-Ice Sir-Vicious rock rhymes galore
Reinforcin' my rule and I'm ready to duel
With another sucker MC who wanna play the fool
Gotta be crazy, mentally unstable
Battle me on the mic, my man on the tables
You could never be smart, an intelligent braniac
Instead you're stupid, crazy-ass maniac
This rap I dedicated to them
All dirty MC’s that’s slimy like phlegm
Waste time on people who should be neglected
Make theyself look bad on a 12-inch record
All sucker MC's, your fate is at hand
Don't ever let me see your butt in a jam
We don't like each other but it's plain to see
It's gonna take all you got to deal with me
Peace!
