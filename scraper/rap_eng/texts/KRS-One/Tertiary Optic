[Chorus: P.A. Soul]
Made you feel like you seen god/
But it comes from inside ya/
Just relax and let these thoughts/
Slowly take you away, this that
Tertiary optic/
Vision of a prophet/
Tertiary optic/
Made you feel like you seen god/
But it’s livin inside ya/
Learn objectively rewire/
Everything ya mind say, this that/
Tertiary optic/
Vision of a prophet/
Tertiary optic/
Just breathe just breathe and you’ll drift away/
Don’t stress this place make you feel so safe/
Just breathe just breathe and you’ll drift away/
Don’t doubt yourself you’ll be fine today/
Just breathe just breathe and you’ll drift away/
Don’t stress this place make you feel so safe/
Just breathe just breathe and you’ll drift away/
Don’t doubt yourself you’ll be fine today/


[Verse: P.A. Soul]
I’m learning how to dig/
Deeper and deeper into the realms of my subconcious with/
Help from DMT I dont doubt, i could be lost in/
Infinity tryna figure it out, I’m spending hours just/
Pondering fuck it ima get out and smell the flowers thats/
When I understand its not the destination, it makes no/
Sense how can the end have all the information, give it/
Consideration, the immature lack the patience and the/
How you know them good times without them shitty days/
How you know ambition if you never feelin lazy its/
Perspective man why we always stuck on the subjective/
Always miss the meaning of the message, the irony is/
Thats the way we always end up losin ourselves, that’s why I/
Think we could use a lil spiritual help, that’s why I/
Say teritary optic use it to move the cosmos bitch this/
Third eye vision make you listen beyond the prophet and /
See the truth/

[Chorus: P.A. Soul]
Open up your third eye vision

[Outro (KRS One sample)]
Memory's not in the brain, memory's in the soul
The only thing you take with you after this life is your memories or your knowledge, your experiences
That's the only thing you take
These two eyes don't see the future, these two eyes don't see the past yet you can see your future and you can see your past
You can actually see your past
What is the sight that can see beyond time?
See this is an ancient meditation
That I am not the flesh
I am the energy, the consciousness, the being in the flesh
This si not religion this is actual fact
