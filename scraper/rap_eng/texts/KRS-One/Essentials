Yo JS, rule number four thousand and eighty is
"the record company people are shady"
The rule number four thousand and eighty one
Is never battle KRS-ONE!
I'm takin' 'em out, how they gonna call my name in the house?
Well it is just back save it up punch in their mouth
You take a little tribe upon me son
I'm like that alcohol that battled your father, remember I won
Used to beat your ass, now you take for me bash
You better take your seat in this class
I'm psychic, I know what's really on your mind
Hmmmm, you wanna be fucked from behind
Take a motherfuck from the nine, don't call it a come-back
This goes verbal my spine, dispurse on the back of your dress
I saw your man sittin' downstairs he did look like whoress
Tryin' to call Chris your crew your crew
Why I gotta come down to this?
I'm here on the stage you like fuck Chris
But backstage I say; Yo you said what Chris?
What your tryin' to move you can't move inches
What your tryin' to pull your DJ's are bitches
Takin' you out that's a sin
You see a new trick like Linda
And fell on his dick like Lewinsky
Never try to get me, never try to outwit me
You can be removed like a titty
Now while I put twenty inch grins on my Benzo
What a car to sit, to low, and bend my fender(?)
Yo Domingo in the back, KRS-one, yes the god of rap
I got JS on the wheels of steel
You know how we feel, Rahzel hit the real!!

[Rahzel]
Ra..ahzel
Brea..eak it down
Rahzel
Brea..eak break it down like this!
