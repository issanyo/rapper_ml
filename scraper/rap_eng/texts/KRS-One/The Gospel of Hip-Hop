KRS-One:
It’s always a privilege to spit with Lars
I’m a reality speaker, forget them cars
I’m learning how to teleport to reach to Mars
When you love this and live this you spit your bars
I spit a quick barrage, switch to ours
Before you get burnt by all these lit cigars
I spit because the time is upon us
Prophecy: education, Nostradamus
Are they the future, or really far behind us
Past perceptions trying to find us and blind us
It’s funny especially when Nostradamus
And none of these prophecies saw the Obamas
Life is a stage and it goes through dramas
So rewrite your script and replace your commas
Life is the crown-work, you’re the farmer
The seed is the idea, Kris Parker!

[Hook]
Everything’s falling apart
(Can't you tell me, can't you tell me!)
Everything’s falling apart
(Can't you tell me, can't you tell me!)

MC Lars:
Born in 82, I voted for Obama
It took ten years but they finally got Osama
PAX Americana, going Seal Team Six
Time to heal these kids, Kris I know they feel these riffs!
Hip-hop is the culture I watch it grow and breathe
The iGeneration knows exactly what it needs
We’re keeping our humanity, empowerment through art
Society is changing, evolution starts (you see)
Hip-hop taught me how to be a man
How to find my voice and love everything I am
Inspired by the youth, their knowledge and their passion
The way they shine the light, like Plato did in Athens (teach!)
What this means is that Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Over Nearly Everybody, never give up on your dreams
Clean energy, equality and a cure for AIDS
It’s on us ’cause we’ve got it and that’s why we keep the faith

[REPEAT Hook]

KRS-One:
The weather’s going crazy
The Earth’s magnetic field is getting wavy
People are feeling more lazy, the future is hazy
In prayer we ask, “Is this the end?” and God replies, “Maybe.”
The whole system is shaky and unreliable, national debt is astronomical
Poor people find this desirable, screaming “I got money!” when poverty is undeniable
The corruption is diabolical, at times even comical
I’m not typical, I’m topical, poetically philosophical
Today’s education is unappliable
I think with my abdominal, life is phenomenal
You make it all up with your optical, every moment is optional
That means anything I think in a blink is possible

[REPEAT Hook]

MC Lars:
Yo, I’m in a van with my band rocking clubs, rocking pubs
Worldwide and I do it for the love ’cause
I see the light in the eyes of the audience
The elements are heaven sent it’s awesome and it’s obvious
You see, we’ve been graph writing since the hieroglyphics
Breakin’ since the dawn of time, ’cause we’re so prolific
It’s that universal rhythm, griots on a mission
Going back to Africa, with stories they were spittin’
Ableton, Serrato, look how far we’ve come
Before we had computers DJs beat on logs and drums
Humming melodies and lyrics I can hear it in my spirit
Peace to Scott La Rock, ’cause he helped to engineer it (legend)
Want to spread the message of salvation over 808s
Digital humanities, we candidly deflect the hate
Let’s work heal the planet – hip-hop – it’s the gospel
With KRS the teacha and MC Lars apostle
