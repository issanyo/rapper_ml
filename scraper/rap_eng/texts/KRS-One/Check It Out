[Intro]
Woop, woop, woop
Pull over, Dust Brothers
KRS-One

[Hook]
People jump up when the action start
Check, check, check it out
KRS-One will take control of a body
Check, check, check it out

[Verse 1]
The living legend, I'm a 7 from Heaven descended
From '87, I promise to keep your body steppin'
Checkin' my lyric weapon which is kept and concealed
But quickly revealed over the wheels of steel
It's got to be real for me
Never faking funk, it's just me
When the club ?, people jump up
I emcee, you rap
The difference? I can flow off of ?
You've got to be handed tracks, pat on your back
Your emceein' be whack, never in tact
Word to the work in my mouth, I see that
But I can never be that, believe that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Do you rememba the Teacha's agenda?
We will be here foreva, time to surrenda
When the action start, you ?
Never lose my tempa, when my temp remembas
You know the sender of the dope beat, rememba
You see the ?, you heard I'm the winna
When the action starts, who gets in ya?
Positive bars, they creep up in ya

[Interlude]
Bidibop-bop-bye
Bidibop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bye
Ba-bye
Bidi-bop-bop-bop, ba-bop-bop, ba-bye
Ba-ba-bop-bop-bye-bye

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
One night you see me, see me ? your TV
Play me on your CD, still you can't believe me
KRS-One will take control of a body
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Kick it like karate, brown like Bobby
Blow like a shadi, how you gon' stop me?
When the action start, I'm snatching your heart
Smashing the chart, flashing the art from back in the park
Forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Ever-ever, forever, forever

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Stay street, stay ?, stay complete
When you compete over beats, reap what you speak
Be discrete, be elite, be the heat
? under their feet, and you will always eat
Forever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Forever, forever, forever-ever-ever
Forever, forever-ever-ever-ever-ever
Forever, forever, and ever

[Hook]
