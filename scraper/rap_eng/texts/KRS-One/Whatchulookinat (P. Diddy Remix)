It's time for you to strike back
In lookin' at you
Well, well, well, well
Whitney Houston
Hoo...hoo...
My-my-my-my-my
And they're watchin' your every move
They're watchin' you

Why you lookin' at me?
Don't get mad at me 'cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at

I feel your eyes on me
You've been tellin' lies on me
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at
Tell me, tell me, tell me

See, I don't understand why you keep peepin' me
When you don't even like me
You're after me and my man, don't think you're
Stressin' me
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no, no

Never thought (Never thought, never thought)
Never knew (Never knew that you) that you would do
This to me (Do this to me)
Tried to ruin me, you're my enemy (You're the enemy)
Never thought (Never thought, never thought, never
Thought)
That you (That you) would act as if you're cool with
Me
(So why you lookin' at me?)

Why you lookin' at me (Oh...oh...)
Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad at me)
'Cause I'm still gonna be me
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Me, me, me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Tell me whatcha lookin' at!)

I feel your eyes on me (Feel your eyes on me)
You've been tellin' lies on me (Tellin' lies)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Tellin' your lies)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at

Oh, you know you're wrong
Don't wanna respect my song
But it's okay 'cause either way
My diamond ring is real strong

You try to show the whole world what I do
But now I'm turnin' the cameras back on you
The same spotlight that once gave me fame
Tryin' to dirty up Whitney's name, no, no

Never thought (Never thought, never thought)
Never knew (Never knew that you) that you would do this to me (Do this to me)
Tried to ruin me, you're my enemy (You're the enemy)
Never thought (Never thought, never thought, never thought)
That you (That you) would act as if you're cool with me
(Why you lookin' at me, oh...)

Why you lookin' at me (Oh...oh...)
Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me
(I'm still gonna be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Tell me, tell, tell)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Look at you)

I feel your eyes on me (I feel your eyes)
You've been tellin' lies on me (You've been tellin' lies on me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (On me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at

Why you lookin' at me (Don't get mad)
Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me (Still gonna be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Ooh...)
Tell me, tell me, tell me (Come on)

Messin' with my reputation
Ain't even got no education
Try to mess with my concentration
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facin'
Oh, you know you need to stop it
Teeth into my name for a profit
God is the reason my soul is free
And I don't need you lookin' at me (Oh...oh...)

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me (Still gon' be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Really can you tell me, tell me)

I feel your eyes on me (Feel your eyes)
You've been tellin' lies on me (You're tellin' lies, lies, lies)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Tell me whatcha lookin' at)

Don't get mad at me (Don't get mad) 'cause I'm still gonna be me (Still gon' be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Oh, no, oh, no)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at (Ooh...oh...ooh...ooh...)

I feel your eyes on me (Don't get mad)
You've been tellin' lies on me (Still gon' be me)
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at
Tell me, tell me, tell me whatcha lookin' at

Look at yourself
