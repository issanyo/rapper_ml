Richard, yeah, boy, come here, let me speak to you
What is this scatting and scratching bullshit
(Incomprehensible)

You ain't washing your own butt, boy
You don't do your work, you don't do nothing
Just scatting and scratching bullshit

How old are you? You're eighteen years old?
At your age, boy, I was the captain of a ship
I was the captain of a ship, boy
I owned and operated my own sea vessel

[Incomprehensible] bullshit
[Incomprehensible], boy
