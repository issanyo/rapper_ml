MC Serch: There was a writer in my neighborhood, a female writer that went to Art And Design named "Too Cute". She used to get up on the C lines. She - Julie Shrenk is her real name - I used to love her black book. She had a great black book, and she'd have Lee and all these others... And I was like, you know, I need to find a name. I was a real inquisitive kid, so she was like, "Why don't you write 'Search'? You're always searching for..." And I was like "Alright, cool." So I used to write S-E-A-R-C-H Search, and then one of my birthdays, my man Kevan Moore got me a nameplate belt buckle. The difference between the 5 letter nameplate belt buckle and the 6 letter nameplate belt buckle was like $35. Crazy, mad dough. So he got me like the 5 and tried to squeeze in an "A" to the S-E-A-R-C-H and I was like "Nah, that don't look right", so I took it out and just had "Serch". That's how the "A" came out of "search"
