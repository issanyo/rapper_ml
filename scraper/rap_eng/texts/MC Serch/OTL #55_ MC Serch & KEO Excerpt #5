KEO: We would all afterwards go to the Burger King, which was a couple blocks away on the short blocks downtown, and it was 24 hours and they had an upper level where you could sit. It would be like me, my man Romeo, Dana Dane, and Biz, and Kane and the Ultramag kids and that whole golden era cats who were just tryna get on... We would be there like trying to get free food from the chicks that worked there, you know where you order a small fries and they fill up the bag with extra shit. We would go up top and somebody would beat on the table and we'd start rhyming. That might go on to the wee hours. I remember hearing a lot of the rhymes that would become like Ultramag's first record before they had records, hearing the routine that became "Just Rhymin' with Biz" before Kane had records, you know what I mean? All that stuff was being perfected right there.
