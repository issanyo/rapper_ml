MC Serch: Jay Cool from the Fresh 3 MC's...

KEO: The Fresh 3 MC's were probably the first guys from Music and Art to have a record deal

MC Serch: F-R-E-S-H fresh fresh fresh, yo that's fresh!

MC Serch: David Scilken, who put together the Beastie Boys, the Young and the Useless

KEO: Sure, sure. All those cats were there. Dave Skilken used to write graffiti. I knew those dudes, um -

MC Serch: May he rest in peace

KEO: Yeah, rest in peace. Uh, incredible jazz musicians like...

MC Serch: Sean F. Green

KEO: My best friend that wrote metro, RTW, great graffiti artist - his father was Ron Carter, the bass player. His name was Miles Carter. And I think he was responsible for introducing a lot of the older jazz heads to hip hop, because originally there was beef. The old jazz dudes were like "yo, they're stealing our records". And that's when Stetsa made that response record. And I think Miles was the one that like, got that whole jazzmatazz thing rolling, introducing his father to Q-Tip and Low End Theory and all of that. He's been out in Paris with John Lun doing incredible art. Just everyone there was a fucking star.
