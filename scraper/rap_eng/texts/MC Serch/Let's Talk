[Intro Skit]
[Karl] Hey what's going on, I'm Hot Karl, I'm here to see VP Serch
[Receptionist] Go right ahead, the door's open
[Karl] Thanks a lot, I'm gonna walk right in there
[Serch] Karl, what's up man, how you doing man?
[Karl] What up, it's good to see you, Serch-
[Serch] Listen, I got somebody on three, hold on. Sheila...
[Karl] Okay-
[Serch] What is- ayy, Dre! Wait, I can't hear him, where's he at?
[Karl] Hey Serch, I thought of some new material-
[Serch] Listen, hold on one second John, I know, I got you, hold on
[Karl] Okay, alright
[Serch] Where's he, in St. Barts? With the family? Alright, listen: I'm gonna call him back and-
[Karl] Oh, that's dope, Serch, I see that-
[Serch] Yo Karl, just give me a second bro
[Karl] Oh
[Serch] Dre, I'm gonna call you back. One

[Verse One]
[Serch]
It's my man Hot Kizzle, take a load off, have a seat
How you feeling, big dog?
[Karl]
Well, good, I think...
[Serch]
Listen, congratulations, I just heard you got signed
[Karl]
I had to stop by, you were my favorite back when you rhymed
[Serch]
Well that was a long time ago, when the rhymes were more slow
KDAY was on our radio, and rappers didn't make dough, but yo
[Karl]
Creatively I really wanted to discuss-
[Serch]
Listen, I been thinking of a formula ever since you signed with us
[Karl]
Oh, a formula, like Serch's D.O.C.-
[Serch]
Now listen! Don't you get snappy with me
[Karl]
I was joking-
[Serch]
Now sit down, we gotta break it down, how to make you sound
First we'll put some freestyles into college underground
Put out two white labels, then two CD singles
Combine 3rd Bass choruses into two-line jingles
Put you on alternative, sold-out tour
Pop your collar! Triple platinum, maybe four!
[Karl]
Wait, hold on Serch, I'm not dissing, but are you listening?
I'm hip-hop and I thought you were too, your point I'm missing
Are you taking my vision to abuse it?
I seen that shit before on Suge Knight's "Behind the Music"
I remember "The Cactus Album", you were a trend-setter
Now you've sold out, you're like 2000's Jerry Heller
[Serch]
Jerry Heller? Let me tell you something, that kid got cash
[Karl]
Sorry, I'll pass, even I know Cube got stuck in the ass
[Serch]
Yep, he got cups filled with stacks, cribs filled with plaques
George-Karl, give it a chance!
[Karl]
Who, me in shiny pants, doing a dance?
I can already hear those "sellout" chants!
[Serch]
No, "sold out", twenty thousand seats in advance!
[Karl]
No thanks, I'll stay underground and bust a B-boy stance
I'm 'a stay true, even if my idol thinks I'm a joke
And I'm a keep it real
[Serch]
Yeah, you're gonna keep it real, alright
[Karl]
That's right, I am 'a keep it real!
[Serch]
You're gonna keep it real broke!

[Hook One]
[Karl]
It's all about the art of hip-hop, no matter if it sells
[Serch]
It's about that Carson Daly and that TRL
[Karl]
We should talk about my thoughts and ideas, gimme the chance to
[Serch]
We should talk about recouping that money we just advanced you
[Karl]
We should talk about the love and the history from the parks
[Serch]
Yes, "106th & Park", number one on their charts
[Karl]
Man, you, got it all wrong, you see, that's not where I'm from
[Search]
Listen, hip-hop is a business, stupid: don't act dumb

[Verse Two]
[Serch]
See, I can understand your dilemma, you're struggling to hold your soul
But after all that struggling: you need to let it go
Free your mind and the dough will flow, it won't be far behind
Just think about the platinum mountain, I've got knives to climb
I'm feeling a little hesistant; you're being obstinate
Credibility of cheddar
[Karl]
I think I'm lactose intolerant
All right Serch, I see what you see, just another white MC
Able to be packaged into cute little CDs
I'm not another gimmick, don't sell me off my image
Don't assume my marketing until my material is finished
Cause no matter what happens it's about my satisfaction
And without a plan B I'll be assed out like Toni Braxton
I'm hip-hop 'til death, what are you insane?
Imagine me with all gold teeth and huge platinum chain!
[Serch]
Hmm... platinum chain, matching fronts
Featuring Cash Money and Manny Fresh, yes Karl, anything you want!
[Karl]
Come on Serch, I was joking!
[Serch]
I'm choking off the cash I'm 'a clear
Karlito, Eminem ain't got shit on you this year!
[Karl]
Aw, listen to this cat, pigeonholing me in rap
Imagining me 'getting jiggy' just to equal SoundScan stats
In fact, G, this could start some beef
I'd rather quit rap than have an R&B joint with Tyrese!
[Serch]
Ah! Hot Karl, another brilliant idea!
Quick, let me call Tony Money and start getting the single cleared!
[Karl]
Ahh dude, are you joking? What are you talking about?
It's becoming obvious why Pete Nice kicked you out!
[Serch]
Don't get it twisted, I left first!
[Karl]
Well, Mr. Big Executive needs to finally get his ego burst!

[Hook Two]
[Karl]
It's all about the art of hip-hop, no matter if it sells
[Serch]
It's about that Carson Daly and that TRL
[Karl]
We should talk about my thoughts and ideas, gimme the chance to
[Serch]
We should talk about recouping that money we just advanced you
[Karl]
We should talk about the love and the history from the parks
[Serch]
Yes, "106th and Park", a free ride on your jock!
[Karl]
Man, you, got it all wrong, you see, that's not where I'm from
[Search]
Listen, hip-hop is a business, man: don't act dumb

[Verse Three]
[Karl]
So I came in here to talk, sit down, and show respect
But I haven't been able to get out one word yet
[Serch]
Karl, you're not listening-
[Karl]
No, listen to me! I was able to get this far
Able to pursue my passion without being a pop star!
[Serch]
Karl, you're not-
[Karl]
SHUT UP! Right here I finally wanna get rid of ya
Burned up in your office like Puffy after Nas's video!
[Serch]
Sheila, get Stoute on two-
[Karl]
Oh, like what's he gonna do?
I'm not a thug but Hot Karl's gonna RUN RIGHT THROUGH!
[Serch]
YES!!! Big Karl, that's what I'm talking about!
You came in an underground MC, but now look how you walking out!
Now you understand my boy, you're ready for the plan
Here's your first advance Chachi, a hundred fifty grand

[Karl]
Yo, that's a hundred fifty G's? All cash?

[Serch]
That's a hundred fifty thousand dollars, Karlito. A hundred fifty G's, can we go to the club now?

[Karl]
Yeah, let's get jiggy
