Wait a minute, I'm white!
I can do whatever I'm white
Yeah, I can do whatever I'm white
Yeah

[Hook:]
When I'm in Detroit
I run red lights
The cops don't mind, it's aight
They say, "You can do whatever, you white."
Baby, I can do whatever I'm white, yeah
I got me some clothes, I dress real whack
Bright white pants and a fanny pack
I can dress however I like
Baby, I can do whatever I'm white, yeah

Anything I want I can buy a couple stocks and
I sit outside and I drink some red wine yeah
And the cops drive by
And they shout, "Hell yeah"
Cause you know that the cops don't care, yeah

[Bridge:]
I love me some hockey
I need me some hockey
Frisbee's aight
But it ain't no hockey
Buy me a retriever
And listen to Reba
I can be a stay at home dad
Yeah

[Hook]

Any time I want, man
I can go golfing
I can go jogging
Ride on my moped
Ride up to the lake front
In my Dodge Neon
Do me some fishing
And some jet-skiing
Grab me my keys and
Head out to the skate rink
Got my roller blades and
A camcorder taping
I can wear my shorts up above my knees
And I always pay my blockbuster fees, yeah
