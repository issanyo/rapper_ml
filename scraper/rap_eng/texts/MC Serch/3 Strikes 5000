[Intro]
You think you're pretty smart. You know why we make out so well? Why no one touches us?
Some white boys don't play that sh—

[Verse 1: MC Serch]
Here is a new hit, that some people don't get
Takin' it lightly, oh no that won't sit
With the Serchlite and the mic set to thrill ya
’Cause you ain't never seen this shade of vanilla
Drill like a sergeant and then I dismiss ya
You're calling En Vogue to hold on while I diss ya
Passing like Strickland ’cause I start to quicken
The pace, 3rd Bass, punk, you start picking
Up where we left off cause you shoulda stepped off
Instead of breaking out your sorry [??]
Slither like a snake, but here is a fact too
White poisonous snakes they can be black too
So don't boost the flex I know the deal
’Cause I've been around the world like that girl Lisa Stansfield
Next time you diss I just might say
Play like Johnny Gill cause you don't rub me the right way

[Chorus]
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand

[Verse 2: Pete Nice]
Kills I ills of the ill seed
Three heed the back stab from serpents free
Those who scam I flim lyrics to
The M-I-N-I-S-T-E-R you're stepping to
The PM the pimp shock goo, you're doo doo
Vic your ducks then vex like voodoo
You're head swollen, your big head soaking off
Rhymes'll slice Pete Nice'll cut your scrotum off
I'm minister mini-stereo and sinister
Pumpin' macanudo like finster
MC's for moving crowds, you're milking cows
Grab the sack, sucking through your foolish mouth
Folks find me on a frenzy on a Prime one
Ripping hats off the jimmy gets the job done
While your jockin', is ya buying or browsing
3 strikes I bugged your nut 5000

[Chorus]
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand

[Verse 3: MC Serch]
Slurping shaft of a brother who has craft
Though he deals the 360 and not have
Serch is first, 3rd Bass is the last word in hip-hop
You take a quick shot of the Thunderbird
Intoxicant, clocking it like we can get took
Gets like your S-curl is a mans look
Took the first pitch for a strike and ya try to switch
To goes through, the call from Richie Rich
Throw a hard slide inside to a lame brain
3 strikes, 5 Gs, end of ballgame

[Chorus]
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand

[Verse 4: Pete Nice]
Boosting boots and suits for gym use
Talk or true it seems your seams are lose
Crank your pot, what I got is devious
A derelict, tongue slipped mischievous
Hose your ho like a hook and ladder hose
Scratched my ass and blew my nose
False prophets play venom seller
The cave dweller drops lyrics a capella
I can tell her to dance to that ill dance
Playing Major Nelson, but wearing those genie pants

[Chorus]
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand
Three strikes to five thousand

[Outro]
