[Elliot Gould]
Why haven't you learned anything?
It's all there, it's all there in Toynbee and those books on the shelf!
Suppression breeds violence!
You're going to raise the curfew an hour? Will you look outside?
You see that kid?
Last week he just wanted to get laid! Now he wants to kill somebody!
(Pigs go home!)

[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Check the scary facts look at where we at
Terrorists, proletariats
Known to carry gats so we interact
Take ya back: 1492
The devil sent over a crew, in America the devil grew
To the current time now the politician be the devilish, forever rich
Barbarian heretic, forever sick
Inject the microchip into my dick
See these criminals of war on trial pleadin' the fifth
And the mental slavery continues
If it was food it'd be their favorite dish on the imperialist menu
We fight to liberate your mind state
But all I see's the fuckin' crack rock
The body count and the crime rate
Notice the life and death cycle
Why they whip them with the rifle
Like Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael
Sharper than stainless steel sherrigan and tie ya weaponry
Walkin' the West Bank like a desert storm veteran

Hook:
Why?, why you feel the need to hold me down
Who?!, who the hell is you to think you down
Where?!, where you gonna be in two thousand and two
What?!, *scratching* "Take these words home and think it through"
(2X)

[Verse 2: MC Serch]
I wanna be the catalyst for every street lyricist
I wanna see this movement like it was in eighty six
I free every son from crimes he ain't commit
I want Persians on the guillotine, with they neck split
I sell the Brooklyn bridge to a Saudi for an Audi
And I'd say, it was proper-ty, of the kings county
I reverse the effects, of physical neglect
I want whores in front of mirrors askin' where's my self respect
I want Ralph Lauren to get down wid Karl Kani
Have rodeo drives smack in the middle of Southside
I really want the Latin quarterback open
A pack of Newports for fifty cent and a quarter for a token

Hook (1x)

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
Sabac hold the style of rap chemist, environmentalist
Feel the highlights of life through the roots of John Flugen
Caught in clenches, the moon shape is in a quarter
Twenty heads just got slaughtered from the stress of a New Yorker
Check the laws of Orca, the holy token's how we built it
Life's filled wid smoke and piss and drinkin' sharp cold feeled it
Four and three sixty for Non-Phixion be the obvious
We handle jakes eliminate fake, stay alive in this
Survivalist overcome reflections of my inner demons
My mind relates to crime like fertile eggs relate to semens
I close my eyes like I was deceased
Envision peace then refuel from the sun in the east

Hook (2x)

[Verse 4: Goretex]
This rap may shatter your faith or strengthen it or you will end-er you
My temperaments foul like tenements I feel you sensitive
The ghetto horror deep within prophecies
Plannin' your own arrest like Jesus tell me you stoppin' me
Jerusalem sun down on the hill three bodies suspended crookedly
They bookin' me, my backs' against the wall with words they pushin' me
It's stated, like righteous kings in the line of David
Never Mercedes all them others made they got me jaded
Facin' the agony victorious call me Maccabees
Apocalyptic, hexin' my rivalries through chemistry
Drama time, shootin' shy guys rockin' econolon
Shootin' no peekin' tryna catch Gore trippin' on punch lines
