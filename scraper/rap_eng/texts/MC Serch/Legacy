[Verse 1: Cestyle]
Who goes there, the element of surprise, recognize my terrorist threats
Others be making ass bets with bounced checks
Credit card scamming is what I examine
Inflicting words causing vocal famine
Letting loose, the wreck loose with neck noose
Tied and overhanging, participles
Supplying and slanging the bionics of phonics
Syllables are left dripping with blood particles
Turning nouns and adjectives to rubble and debris
Emergency shot therapy
My remedy recipe for an immune deficiency
Take two of me and call me in the morning
Bright and early niggas to proceed with daily warning
I got you hooked, line, and sinker with no bait
I'll make you salivate, pulmonary's palpitate
From and increasing heart rate
When I aggravate your attempt at an assault
See your front lines with landmines down to a halt
With extortion, the black male tale from the holy grail
All hail my train of thoughts third rail
Non-stop expressing, turning every local into Chernobyl
Concentrating, my points out of focal
My thoughts digress and into check like superior superhero
Robert de Niro niggas, I label zero the infinite powers
The algebraic equation of c=mc2 and whoever tests is unprepared
For oral examination, innovation with no limitation without no hesitation

[Hook]
My heart feels what you feels
My eyes see what you see
For all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
I'll infiltrate your fortress, you make me nauseous, be cautious
My lyrics twist like a contortionist
I'm putting garbage emcees out of they misery
Now first verbally, but then if necessary physically
It don't matter to me, either or, I declare war
Hop in your territory and explore
Over enemy lines rhymes climb, in their designs
Overthrow and override ya mind
Truth to tell, I'm forced to excel, fought with the hell
Kickin' this shit to hit ya fuckin' head like a size 12 boot
I'm shooting this shit like a blow gun
You should know son, my tongue is swinging swords like a shogun
I emphasize like emphysema
Every word I speak creeps up in your blood stream like leukemia
Instigation of mutilation, under federal investigation
Escaping police stations, what's your nation?

(Black like Zulu bees, twisting trees, killing enemies
Misery comes in threes so Ill will cover these)

Cool, with these eyes behind ya cranium
Take it from the beats to the streets to the stadium

[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
No substitution for the revolution that we bringing
Clinging to the masses, but some bastard got my ears ringing
Must be from the caca he was speaking
Depending on freaking, acting but he's weak
And can't even test my skills
My skills come like boots
Hold up let me put you back up on the roots
Brooklyn chariots of fire magnify cess smokers
Culture driven like Jamaicans down in Park Side
Faltbush we sideways, gats push domes back
Attack like C. Thomas Howell in Red Dawn style
My 9 inch sights are like Celestine prophecy
Got to be golden and sculpture like pottery that's ancient Egyptian
Conniption fits, flips that contradict with Non Phixion hits
So break out Brooklyn, Queens, the outskirts and between
For those who front mean, I'mma kill your self esteem

[Hook]
My heart feels what you feels
My eyes see what you see
For all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on

My heart feels what you feels
My eyes see what you see
For all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on

[Verse 4: Goretex]
Wisdom for the unclean, dust fiends unite
Brothers who seen cream or holding they crack pipes for insight
I'm Christly to ice b, moving like electrical connections
Resurrect the people in my sections
Time or global, Judaic, mind's satanic, crime mechanic
Blast rhymes in Aramaic, I produce thoughts that's raw
Like fiberglass in newports, no shorts
Chewbacca got sold when I teleport
Paid like Toody, scarf the resource and clams landfills like manbuilds
Touch god on desert sands, Shiite madman
Packing rimshots and bedpants
Gorilla reinforcements, safeguard the wastelands
The rap veteran, quick to blast republicans
My ghetto's communist cause revolution calls for non-Americans
Back up, I'm strapped with bombs on my back
And it's like that Mussolini, Medina, Arafat

[Verse 5: MC Serch
I hang with goons with grilles that stop traffic
Can't adjust your comfort like a craftmatic
Sporadic, your flow's sleeping like a narcoleptic
Perfected, rhymes of life in times both connected
Intercepted like Keanu Reeves in Speed
Get the cash and clean, Casino's Ace Rothstein
Beam me to another layer of ozone where phones don't own dial tone
And I stay prone to write lyrics alone and hang in hotels with Connie Sellecca
To laying, serving drinks on my loveboat, floating off savage America
How you gonna politic without no campaign?
While politicians get snuffed for not getting in the game at my primary
I'm gonna name names
Or let the pentagon "ohh" they start to take aim
In my hexagon there's a lieutenant who's a spy
So if you try me, it goes back to they own eye
96 and 76 the revolution still spinning gas phase still gets given

[Hook]
My heart feels what you feel
My eyes see what you see
For all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on

My heart feels what you feel
My eyes see what you see
For all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on

My heart feels what you feel
My eyes see what you see
Through all eternity, there'll be no one like me
When we gone, this legacy will carry on
Non Phixion stay strong so bring it on and on and on (What?)
