[Hook: Willz]
Yeah I'm smoking strong in this bitch
I'm gone in this bitch
Yeah I'm a boss so you fucking with a don in this bitch
Yeah I'm prolonging these hits
This song is a hit

[Verse 1: Willz]
We smoking gas, think I can't do it Exxon in this bitch
Rips of the bong in this bitch
I'm holding in smoke, I hold it all when you hit
You and your mom getting hit
A middle eastern girl, she the bomb in this bitch
Like she's Saddam in this bitch
I do recon then I spit
Got 8 grams of the burnt, four O's of the lean
Got a couple backwoods and my bong next to me
Smoking the glass that you pass to the hash
To the back then (?) fill it with pack
Homie I'm lowkey, in fact you don't know me
Unless you sell drugs or you matching (?) pack
These don't approach me, don't know how to act
We blowing OG, like an asthma attack
Reading a bong, got a cup full of Act'
Now I spit in they palm, no need for a match
Willz got the (?) facing Rico getting wasted
(?) the squad (?) replacement
You trap out the bando, the dojo a basement
We put y'all to sleep like y'all just been sedated
My (?) I'm high like a space ship
Faded, now you in a situation that's hard to escape
But you try to evade it
You smoking dimes while my whole team got waited
You hated, I smoke till my tree dissipated
We facing
Now we OD and we faded
These fancy (?) try imitate us

[Hook: Willz]
Yeah I'm blowing strong in this bitch
I'm gone in this bitch
I got your bitch taking rips of the bong in this bitch
Don't take too long with these hits
This song is a hit
I got them bad bitches all singing along to this shit
Yeah I'm blowing strong in this bitch
I'm gone in this bitch
I got your bitch taking rips of the bong in this bitch
Don't take too long with these hits
This song is a hit
I got them bad bitches all singing along to this shit

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
We smoking strong in this bitch
Hella bongs in this bitch
If your nigga leave with me we going home to spark a zip
We going home to drink a pint while he got you smoking
Me and your boyfriend blowing up my phone
And I'm like nigga can I live?
Why you mad? We smoke hash, we spark gas
Fuck you mean nigga?
Please don't ever compare yourself to me nigga
Fuck you thought, you still smoking sticks and seeds nigga
Hit the bong and I don't cough cause I'm the Dr. Clean nigga
Pack so loud like a white bitch screaming
Niggas still opps and these hoes still tweaking
Talk shit about the squad and I leave your ass leaking
Money, team, and hips, so my whole team eating
I'm killing you bitches, you syphilis snitches
I light up the pack, backwoods and swishers
He taking my pictures, he loving my rhythm
I pass me the weed, he pass me the liquor
You niggas bout you, my (?) deliver
Got Uzis, got nines, got niggas that's cuzz
Got bitches that stalk, no bitches that talk
You all in my clit so I tell her get lost
Said "Rico do you love me?" I said "nah that's a set"
If you really wanna (?) I'm serving niggas where you live
If you skim me I'ma rob you
Take your money, scare your mommy
You can try me bitch, don't try me
He won't love but it's bad timing

[Verse 3: Highlife Cato]
I'm blowing all strong, that's that Hercules
Pack god caught a plug, it's an emergency
Blowing grade A at Highlife University
College hoes wanna match, I tell 'em certainly
(?) god Cato what you know
She blowing on my bong and she don't even smoke
Rewind this whole verse and tweet yourself a quote
I'm smoking on this presidential, I don't need your votes
I be cooling up in the stars and the clouds
There's a big difference between the stars and the crowd
All these haters really fast, think they knocking me down
Same clowns when I'm on try to spark with me now
We them niggas, we them niggas, can't you see
When I get a down bitch she gon' always smoke for free
But until then I turn up and stack this cheese
And watch out for them snakes and them rats that's tryna eat

[Bridge: Highlife Cato]
Smoke good, live life
Tomorrow ain't promised so I'm turning up tonight
Smoke good, live life
Tomorrow ain't promised so I'm turning up tonight

[Hook: Willz]
Yeah I'm blowing strong in this bitch
I'm gone in this bitch
I got your bitch taking rips of the bong in this bitch
Don't take too long with these hits
This song is a hit
I got them bad bitches all singing along to this shit
Yeah I'm blowing strong in this bitch
I'm gone in this bitch
I got your bitch taking rips of the bong in this bitch
Don't take too long with these hits
This song is a hit
I got them bad bitches all singing along to this shit
