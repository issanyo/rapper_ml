[Intro]
Uh yeah

[Verse 1]
Slaying hoes in vogue you know how it go
Juug a bitch and beat clip, he already know
These bitches sweet, trick or treat
Leaving bodies in the street
Bitches lame, I don't know who they wanna be
You wanna ride up in my lane, sorry you a lame
You wanna smoke up all my weed, bitch you gon' have to pay
May I just add a little something
If my pussy ain't wet why your boyfriend keep calling
Maybe I stole him
Maybe it's golden
Why you so open?
He say it's golden
Get off my clit, all my bitties it lit
He said my titties the shit
I said you know who I is

[Verse 2]
Killing this shit, flow sick
Girl some (?) on that bitch
I'm in the view smoking (?) with your bitch
I got the heart, you give dome to my men
How the hell are we supposed to be friends? Bitch
I don't fuck with the help, get woke or get left
AK or the Tec, you act right or get wet
Why would I work up a sweat when broke bitches do that?
I don't care who you are cause you'll never sit where I'm at
You'll never see what I see
Cause all I see is the green
You'll never smoke what I smoke
Because my tree man is me
Now I can rap about myself and all the wild shit that I've seen
All the men that I've lost and all the snakes that I meet
But please let me keep this shit cordial
I don't support you
You mad at me? That's some shit that you can't afford to do
Bitch I'm onto you, your nigga onto me
Get your dude bitch, like

[Hook]
Bitch I'm hotter than the sun
You might see Rico with the really big gun
Your friends salty
A nigga want me but I'm counting this money
Fuck with me, fuck with me
Bitch I'm hotter than the sun
Bitch I'm hotter than the sun
You might see Rico with the really big gun
Your friends salty
A nigga want me but I'm counting this money
Fuck with me, fuck with me

[Verse 3]
Where's the competition?
What's the lituation?
You niggas toss my shit
Boy you on that sneaky gay shit
I'm on that paid shit
Don't fuck unless he pay bitch
You can ask my enemies
I don't play friends with these
Bitches at my neck for my shit
And no I don't ever-ever got time for no regular bitch
Wearing her regular shit and her regular life
With her (?) me baby girl, you ain't my type
My (?) too expressive to be fighting you hoes
And my guns so big they got they own area codes
And my nigga so cool he brings me everywhere he goes
And everybody knows pockets on swole, heart on cold
Weed on lit
Her titties sitting perfect, backwoods on hit
Bars on oh shit, just quit you'll never be me, queen
RICO, bow down to queen me, queen Ri
You might as well just kill me
I slay shit, you a roach to ray bitch
I speak and get paid, you broke it's okay
JK it's not
I'm at the top, you not, that's the difference bitch
