[Chorus]
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go

[Verse 1]
L-L-Let it go, let it go, I’m smokin' on medical
They watch me through a telescope, Fendi on me head to toe
A lot of bitches try to do it, but I do it better though
I don’t gotta prove shit, because they already know
Pull up and we let ‘em go, take a leap Geronimo
Light ‘em up, knock ‘em down, these bitches look like dominos
They fakin' like the real thing, they remind me of Sweet and Low
I hustle like a ball player, fast break, coast to coast, woah!

[Chorus]
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go

[Verse 2]
I-I-I just shipped a pound off, no exercise, I’m losin' weight
I ain’t gonna argue with you, this shit ain’t no debate
I-I-I can see it in her face, mad 'cause I’m in first place
We could get it in, any day, anytime, any place
How you feel Rico? Bitch I feel great! Huh?
I see you gettin' money, oh my god, bitch you’re so late
It’s like a sixth sense, I can tell when a bitch fake
I-I-I mind my own business I don’t know why these hoes hate
Stop askin' for a handout, go and get your own plate
Before you cross a bad bitch, boy you better look both ways
Ridin' in that big body and it’s takin' up both lanes
Got a bad bitch, and you know she go both ways
You can catch me

[Chorus]
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go
R-R-Ridin' in a white 'Vette, black rims, Oreo
Why they don’t like me? Ask them, I don’t know
Is it 'cause they can’t come close? Shit, probably so
If you ain’t gon’ do nothin' then let it go
