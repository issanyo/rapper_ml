[Intro]
Rico-Rico
Haha, yeah, yeah
WhoisMike goin' crazy
Yeah, yeah, Sugar Trap

[Hook]
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool

[Verse 1]
Yuh, yeah
Kill a bitch with kindness, rumor is I'm lyin'
I don't like you, I won't hide it
I don't check tags, I just buy it
What I'm wearin', you can't find it
Couldn't wait to drive it, I was ridin' in a Hybrid
Now she wanna ride me
Audi and it's bright red, Gucci glasses, blindin'
Somewhere on an island, you somewhere stalkin' my shit
You probably like me or you might be jealous
You know I'm the shit, you can't act like you can't smell me
Get up off my dick, go get you a pretty penny
All the bitches in my clique get lit if you pass some Henny
But don't get nothing twisted, they look bad but they ain't friendly
I got OG by the ounce, I smoke more than a damn chimney

[Hook]
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool

[Verse 2]
Keep it on my fucking hip, 'cause this shit, it might get hectic
You ain't got no pool, you ain't even got no leverage
Shoulda stayed in school, you a lame and I could tell it
Addicted to this money, I wake to go and get it
Bitches steal my swag, tell that hoe gimme my credit
Young bitch with a bag, you know that I'm well respected
If a bitch wanna play with me, I make sure that she regret it
When I walk up in the party, make your bitch look like a peasant
Yeah, yeah

[Hook]
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool
All this money in my pocket, they all blue, they all blue
They like, "Rico is you ballin', is it true, is it true?"
When they see me out in person, "is it you, is it you?"
Bitches talk a lot of shit, but I could never lose my cool
