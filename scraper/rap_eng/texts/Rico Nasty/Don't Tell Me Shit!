Please don't rap me up, bitch this ain't no fucking cypher
Oh, I'm sorry told shawty flip a brick
Baby lost it now she in some deep shit
Not my problem, I'ma hit my next lick

All of my (?) are foreign, all of my clothes are expensive
I got him eating this pussy, (?)
Baby girl I'm so savage, living life I'm so lavish
All you bitches is jokers so you know that I'm laughing
Laughing at you bitches on my way to the bank
All of you bitches is in hiding like you name was Ann Frank
No disrespect to the dudes cause my check was diamond encrusted
And disrespect none of my niggas or my guns get to busting
(?) bitch, no discussion
I'm balling, no limits, while you ball on a budget
Oh my God man, I love it
Screaming I'm not in the cut, I'm at the bank
I didn't go MIA, I went money hunting
Cause I'm a baby lover, money lover
I can't stand an undercover

Niggas checking like I want 'em
Baby you the only one, nigga don't tell me that
He  said baby you my number one, nigga don't tell me that
