[Verse 1: Warhol]
Gosha my linen, I keep me a pigeon
Made the decision now codeine I'm pissin'
Back to back bitches, I keep me a fifty
Chop up the dough how she fuck up the kitchen
Chef on my bitches, come stay with the lemons
Take any doses, I pilfer the feeling
Fuck with emotion, I can't see the ceiling
I put the dot on the head like you Krillin
Switch up the dot, keep the beam on the steamer
Fendi my focus I drip like a preacher
Keep pressing on me and I lean like a meter
My Cuban in cleaners, it needed a cleanup
I switch up the pace, I watch for the Jakes
I beat it like Zay, piano I play
I play with the keys, and I [?] by the day
Bust out the form, we swerving the hate
I'm needing my check so I fly overseas
Keep Undercover like I cut up tees
Bitches bustin', they be sticking like fleas
Slimy niggas wipe your nose like a sneeze
[?] niggas be wanting something
Pissy, I know you're fussy
And I know we tuckin'
Niggas a dime a dozen
He pour the Robitussin
Keep Aquafina, put three in a liter

I trap in the bando, hit me on the beeper
I pour when I'm landing, I'm kissing the Easter
I'm fly like air force
I keep me some horses

In Paris, I need me some woods, I import em
Nigga be fishin', like fuck it I don't want it

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Rollin loud, smokin' loud
Ain't have a car I can't valet it now
Talking shit, pulling up
Point em out, like who the one who said it, now?
Few pounds, touch down
He said, "I never seen a bitch bust it down"
Watch what you doing and who you do it to
'Cause what go around could come back around
If money was milkin' I need me a cow
Proving 'em wrong like did I hear a doubt?
Gotta roll out you fucking up my count
You see what I'm doing, you know what I'm about
When I count my stacks, that shit make sound effect
Got these bitches really mad, cause they see I'm in my bag
They like, "Oh my goodness, you wish you fucking could bitch"
In a new car with a white girl that's a Cool Whip
Ain't no one to fool with
Never on no bullshit
