[Verse 1]
I know that you're bad for me
But you're the air I breathe
Suffocate when you leave
Nicotine when you scream
What have you done to me
What have you done to me
You are my everything
I give you everything
Now what is left of me
You got the best of me
Give you the rest of me
Give you the rest of me
Knew when I picked you up

[Hook]
It would be like a drug
Like a drug
Like a drug
It would be like a drug
Like a drug
Like a drug
