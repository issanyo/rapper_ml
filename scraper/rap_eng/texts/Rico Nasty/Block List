[Verse 1]
You know my block list poppin'
You ain't gone dish it little boy just stop it
Don't call my phone if you talking that nonsense
He wanna call me but my block list poppin'
He talkin' reckless so i had to block him
I took her nigga, bitch that ain't my problem
Now she wanna fight me cause she see i'm poppin'
I hate these niggas they be on that option
Told me he love but I stole his wallet
And once he noticed then I had to block him
He wanna smoke well I think I want to rob him
And once I get back to my crib then I will block him
