[Verse 1]
Smokin' stuffed crust
Bitches on my line, tell ‘em back up
Designer on my feet, better back up
If you want beef bring back up
I just hit a show, run my sack up
Gotta attitude problem, don’t act up
You know I’m coolin' in the cut with my mag tucked
And all my niggas Rowdy Ruff, yeah they get buck
She trying to get up in the club, claimin' she know us
Yeah, yeah, woah, huh?

[Hook]
Bitch back up
I just got a check, run my sack up
My weave and my motherfucking make up
Cost more than your whole damn life does
Ugh, broke bitch
Haha, lil hoe back up
Designer on me, bitch back up
From my head to my feet, bitch back up
Lil hoe you a fan, you need to back up
Back up, back up
Bitch you need to back up

[Verse 2]
Aye, you need to back up
Run my sack up
Bitches hating because I just run my math up
What’s your problem? I can solve 'em
Bitches hatin', I’ma fuck around and rob 'em
You don’t want no drama, keep it ‘bout the commas
Catch me in the club, I got my problem solver

[Hook]
Bitch back up
I just got a check, run my sack up
My weave and my motherfucking make up
Cost more than your whole damn life does
Ugh, broke bitch
Haha, lil hoe back up
Designer on me, bitch back up
From my head to my feet, bitch back up
Lil hoe you a fan, you need to back up
Back up, back up
Bitch you need to back up

[Outro]
B-b-b-b-back up
Back-back-back up
