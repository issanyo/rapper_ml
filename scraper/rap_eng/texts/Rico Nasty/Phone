[Intro]
WhoisMike

[Hook]
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit
Don’t call my phone, on some dumb shit
Don’t ring my line, if you don’t want shit
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit

[Verse 1]
I am not your idol, I cannot advise you
All I can remind you, please stay in the Bible
Demons come and find you, I don’t even like you
But I got to warn you, this life is a cold shark tank
Niggas watch you hit the bank, now they smilin' in your face
They wanna see you win the race, hopin' they can take you place
I can tell real from the fake, bitches smiling in my face
Just wanna eat up off my plate, but

[Hook]
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit
Don’t call my phone, on some dumb shit
Don’t ring my line, if you don’t want shit
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit

[Verse 2]
What’s a Honda to a Wraith? What’s a star without some hate?
My next house must have a lake, on to big and better thangs
Seen your money moving slow, seen my money moving fast
Seen that you couldn't keep up with me, I left you in the past
Drinkin' ace of spades in the club, watch me dance
Watch me get the cash, watch me get the bands
Watch me run it up, bitch you know what’s up
That’s why you duck and bum
Know you gotta keep your image up
So you ac'n tough, yeah

[Bridge]
Don’t call my phone on some bullshit
Don’t ring my line

[Hook]
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit
Don’t call my phone, on some dumb shit
Don’t ring my line, if you don’t want shit
Don’t call my phone, on some bullshit

[Outro]
Yeah
