[Intro]
I don't know what to say right here but I'm bout to rap. I'm thinking like right here

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
This that shit that my real niggas ride to
Pick us up some thots, tell them nasty hoes to come through
I don't like broke niggas, seen you with them fake shoes
Fake gold up in your mouth, you hoes hating, fuck you
Ugly hoes wanna jump me
Niggas claiming that they'd fuck me
Guessing that I'm famous
I'm on your nigga playlist
Got a lotta views on my KalahDiss
I'm the shit, you the piss
Why you pissed? You dismissed bitch

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
This is for my niggas that like smoking weed
Pussy niggas mad they be smoking .3's
Nigga want his money back
I worked you, I'm proud of that
Spend my money, get it back
My hittas dressed in all black
My nigga I'm sipping on a 40
Hit you with my 40
I don't even (?) if the bitches do it for me
I'm a boss bitch
Talk shit, get split
Pull that trigger my nigga
Said you wanna talk shit

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high
I said switch on my dick
Smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why
It's probably cause you ain't high

[Verse 3: Nile$]
Get the fuck from around me cause I don't fuck with none of y'all fuck niggas
Y'all lolipops cause y'all suck nigga
Keep the Mac roc cause it bust quick
And I'm iced out like I play hockey
I'm a dot you can't out top me
Killed the beat, need an autopsy
Young A$AP, my neck rocky
I've been killing beats for like too long
And I ain't never gonna get locked up
I ain't Usher nigga, don't get caught up
So don't fuck around, get your jaw crushed
And you are struck and that's all luck
While I toss guts
(?) your balls suck
And I'm in a white girl mouth like Starbucks
And you jaw fucking
And I'm - while I'm tossing
You ain't matching now I'm sparking
Keep a .30 on my hip like walkie talkie
What you talking bout?
I walk up in your house and fuck your bitch
And spark your loud
Bitch I'm higher than a cloud
And I ain't never coming down
Like I let go of a balloon, wait
(?) flow and it's new
Hotter than a furnace room
In the fucking month of June
Like cocaine brownies coming soon
Bitch I'm balling hard, y'all niggas acting gold and blue
Fuck your bitch up in your room
Like swish on my dick, smack a bitch, hit a lick
If you mad, I know why, probably cause you smoke mid
Got 100 clips with the shits
Your bitch swallow my kids
Your shoes tied so don't trip
Bitch and I ball hard like the Knicks
Getting bills like I'm Daffy, I don't really know what you ducking for
Like a stripper's ass I'm untouchable
I took (?) slow
And that's crunch time
Mike Tyson with this rap shit, I'm about mine
So me spitting a punch line is a punchline
