[Intro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Hook]
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
We keep guns just like Gilbert Arenas
I'm a bad bitch, I'm no diva
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
We keep guns just like Gilbert Arenas
I'm a bad bitch, I'm no diva
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
We keep guns just like Gilbert Arenas
I'm a bad bitch, I'm no diva

[Verse]
We keep 21 shots, no Savage
Bust the pack up out the plastic
Base the whole J, I don't pass it
Whip foreign, you better not crash it
Disrespect, no we can't have it
Pull up on you, cause some damage
Go to dinner, eat some salmon
We don't do shit just for cameras
She pop percs or she pop xannies
But the liquor she can't handle
Caught a plug, his name is Danny
I keep bags like I was Santa
That bitch wyling all on camera
She remind me of Nick Cannon
My wrist shining like a lamp and
He like when I talk in Spanish
You wanna paint me like a canvas
I be balling like the Mavericks
I'm (?) like I'm Randy
This gas smelling just like candy
We drink champagne in the car
Bitch you still scared of the dark
If you keep up all that faking you won't make it very far
You won't make it very far
They gon' line you up in chalk
If the feds ever grab me, I won't tell them what I saw
I won't tell what I seen
Bitch what the fuck do you mean?
I keep bands all in my jeans
It's busting up out the scenes
I run shit like I'm the dean
She lick me until I'm clean
Extendos long like limousines
I seen this shit in my dreams

[Hook]
We got guns like Gilbert Arenas
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
I'm a bad bitch, I'm no diva
We got guns just like Gilbert Arenas
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
I'm a bad bitch, I'm no diva
We keep guns just like Gilbert Arenas
Just like Gilbert Arenas
I can't wait till I sell out arenas
