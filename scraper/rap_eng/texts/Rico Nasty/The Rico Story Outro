[Intro]
It's the end of my tape
You get angry
I go like why you hate me?
You know what it is

[Verse]
I'm that type of bitch that make a nigga run away with me
I'm the type of bitch that make your boyfriend want to stay with me
I'm the type of bitch that got your (?) fucking hating me
Stop tweeting my ass like ah man y'all fucking angry b
I'm the type of bitch that got hoes making fake pages
Wanna know who my boo is and who my bae is
I'm the type of bitch that prolly call your ass out
Tell your friends you a pussy, take your money, cash out
I'm the type of bitch that got your ex-bitch stalking me
I'm the type of bitch that got my ex-nigga watching me
Hoes so mad cause I'm looking so good
Eating Japanese three times a week, you wish you could
And I wish you would text my number with some bullshit
Baby girl I'm crazy, your lil ass is on some fu shit
Talking bout you wild like you don't got my digits boo
If you wanna fight then just say it, quit the fronting hoo
I'm the type of bitch your friends hate so they unfollow me
