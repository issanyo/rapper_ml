Yuh, feel like I'm ridin' in a spaceship, 15 for my shades bitch
Pistol to his ear, I'm like, "what the fuck you say bitch?"
I'm ridin' in a spaceship, 15 for my shades bitch
Pistol to his ear, I'm like, "what the fuck you say bitch?"
I'm ridin' in a huh? 15 for my what?
Pistol to his ear, I'm like, "what the fuck you say bitch?"

[Verse 1]
Yuh, yuh, yuh, feel like I’m riding in a spaceship
Lemme make this clear
I just smoked 'bout ten grams on the way here
You ain’t smoking no gas, boy you be fake hit
You ain’t got no bottles in the club, you be fake lit
I could show you how to get some money, nigga wait here
They say, "how she get her name so fast?" Like, she don’t play fair
All these bitches is my kids you’d think I'd own a daycare
This ain’t where you play around, nigga it ain’t safe here
If you ain’t fuck with me back then, then nigga stay there
Designer frames on my face, I had to make that shit clear
Blue Benjamins I’m countin' match my blue hair
Truth is they won’t try shit, nigga I dare
You know I'm

[Verse 2]
I don’t pass the blunt, I face it, I’m winnin', they can’t face it
I know that I’ma make it, it’s so close, I can taste it
She say can she get a little, she just wanna taste it
Chase your dreams, if you got some talent you better not waste it
Wasted, if you fuck her then, you better use a latex
Niggas be undercover, eavesdroppin', tryna hear shit
Pistol to his ear, maybe I can let you hear this
Fuck being broke, a young bitch, tryna get rich
Fuck what I owe, lil’ nigga come and take it
In the stu' all night 'cause trappin’ be my day shift
Bitch bring your own gas 'cause niggas like to lace shit
Bitches like to talk a lot but see me and don’t say shit
