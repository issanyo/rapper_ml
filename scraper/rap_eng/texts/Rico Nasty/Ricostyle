New [?] in my closet, need to call a locksmith
Stop blowing up my phone you'll end up on the block list
Watch it, I know that they all be watching
Even the haters watching, do anything to stop it

They saying they don't know me over time
Press rewind, just press rewind
I remember when I couldn't even rhyme
I remember when they was all hating
But that paper I was chasing
I remember when my mama told me to stay patient
Yeah, now I'm patient, I'm caking
When I look up at the stars I see myself
'Cause I'm who I wanna be, yeah
Wouldn't wanna be anybody else
I can only see me, no I can't see nobody else
Put you pride up on the shelf
I'm a boss bitch and I got it out the mud
Now I'm flossing, so you hating 'cause you broke
It's okay girl, it's okay, it's okay
That you late and I'm paid, smoking grade A
Ever day is pay day, baby what you waiting for?
Why are you saving whores? Baby go hop aboard
Whenever I shoot I score, yeah
Just look up at the board, you see my score and I'm winning

Bitches always hating on that sugar trap shit, no
Bitches tryna copycat my sugar trap shit
I got it out the mud, I don't ever need no clique
I ain't never need no dude to tell me what to do
