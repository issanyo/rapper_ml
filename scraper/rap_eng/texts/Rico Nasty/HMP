[Intro]
I was really hoping you'd pick up because I miss you. Oh what and um I'm sorry I'm crying right now but I'm drunk and um, I miss you so much and you know this is some bullshit

[Hook: Freeco]
She wanna call my phone
I hit you with my niggas
I ain't tryna entertain ya
Baby I just wanna hit you
Voicemail saying call me back, call me back
Hear my phone saying call me back, call me back
Phone blowing up, I ain't tryna deal with ya
You need to have some patience baby I ain't gon' forget ya
Voicemail saying call me back, call me back
Hear my phone saying call me back, call me back

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
Call me back, call me back
They like it when I arch my back
Yeah just like that
Handcuff me, I'm like free the real
You know the deal
He begging me to hit-hit his phone
I'm all alone at the top
But I can't share the throne
So no one's home
Voice mail popping, baby leave me alone
I'm on the run
I'm on the run this brain is crazy
Oh baby put this cape on tryna save me
But I'm a villain
Sorry I ain't catching feelings, I ain't a dummy
When you get drunk that is when you show that you love me
I can't trust him, don't play games boy this ain't Atari
Feel like he using me, I'm Nicki and he's Safaree
Riding round out in the city and my bitches with me
He blow my phone up like Osama
Man fuck the drama
The sex is good but it ain't worth it
Is it worth it?
Swear that he do this shit on purpose
You really work it

[Hook: Freeco]
She wanna call my phone
I hit you with my niggas
I ain't tryna entertain ya
Baby I just wanna hit you
Voicemail saying call me back, call me back
Hear my phone saying call me back, call me back
Phone blowing up, I ain't tryna deal with ya
You need to have some patience baby I ain't gon' forget ya
Voicemail saying call me back, call me back
Hear my phone saying call me back, call me back

[Verse 2: Freeco]
She say call me back, where the fuck you at?
Stop asking questions bitch I'm back
She loving how I bend her back
Pull on her, try slam (?)
I make you cry, I make you scream
You want my love, that's in your dreams
I promise baby you will never ever get this hard for me
Unless you fly, I'll take you far
I'll show you things you never saw
A perfect day, we having fun but baby you are not the one
I can guarantee you are not the one I wanna be with
Yeah that shit's some torture
I'm drowning in it like the faucet leaking
Yeah you looking beautiful but I don't want relationships
You hit my phone when you alone cause you know I be breaking it
But just know I ain't saving shit
I like you but won't chase a bitch
I run it up and now you wanna fuck with me, that's crazy shit
I left at hello but I came back for the thots
(?) average guys
I can't take you off my mind
I gotta erase you from my mind
I can't give you another try
I hit you up another time
Sorry girl this shit's goodbye

[Hook: Freeco]
She wanna call my phone
