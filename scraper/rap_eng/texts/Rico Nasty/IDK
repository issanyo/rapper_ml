[Intro]
Look in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane

[Hook]
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
How bout you just ask me
Maybe come and ask me
How bout you just ask me
Nigga you can ask me

[Hook]
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
How bout you just ask me
Maybe come and ask me
How bout you just ask me
Nigga you can ask me
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me

[Verse]
Smoke the dope then ash it
Designer on, I'm classy
People always talking but they do not know the facts and ay
I'm just sitting here laughing
Cause money keep on stacking
And it's funny how you stretching your last dollars like elastic
I'm a real bitch and I do real shit
You got clout for being an actor all morning in the met
Nigga tryna give me sex, I ain't replying to his text
Cutting thirsty niggas off and I ain't talking, I'm (?), ay
I ain't know what they saying bout me
But I bet that they won't at me first
Make 'em drive off like a motherfucking taxi
Talking all this boss shit but you riding in the back seat
And he say he know my name is what it is, I get it nasty

[Hook]
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
How bout you just ask me
Maybe come and ask me
How bout you just ask me
Nigga you can ask me

[Hook]
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
How bout you just ask me
Maybe come and ask me
How bout you just ask me
Nigga you can ask me
I don't know what they told you
And I don't know what she told you
I don't know what he told you
But how bout you just ask me
