[Chorus]
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets

[Verse 1]
My life look like a movie so I know that they be watching
If you don't get the bigger picture, then you need to crop it
Beefing on the internet, in person, wanna squash it
Riding in a spaceship, going fast like a rocket
Every time I post a picture, they make me the trending topic
They hate me then they love me and it ain't no way to stop it
Some people say I'm ugly and some people say I'm gorgeous
I know that I am stubborn, cause my sign is a Taurus
Hot just like the summer and my money is enormous
Smoking Key Lime OG, I got green like a forest
It must be a bummer, know you wanna come and join us
I don't wanna listen to your problems, cause they aren't important

[Chorus]
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets

[Verse 2]
I am so unbothered, somewhere swimming in the tropics
I don't want your negativity or energy, it's toxic
You wanna be around me, and then turn around and gossip
Make sure that you be careful, cause somebody's always watching
You'll be surprised what people do when they ain't got no options
Smoking sticky cookies, it reminded me of chocolate
Set the bar high, know it's hard for you to top it
I lost my mind a while ago, don't think I'm gonna find it

[Chorus]
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
My neck, my wrist, my teeth on hockey
You be pocket watchin' but it's nothin' in your pockets
