[Intro]
Knew it was a reason I ain't go to school
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Making it do what it do
I make it do what it do
I make it do what it do
I make it do what it do

[Verse 1]
I started from nothing, yeah I had to make due
When you on the come up, they gonna hate you
But you can't be mad, 'cause they mad they ain't you
Shittin' on 'em, it's just something they can't do
So I just sit back and let 'em talk about shit
That I know ain't true
Or listen to bitches that swear that they knew you
Cash in my pockets
How much? I give you a clue
Any bill that I pull out remind you of Blue's Clues
I never lose
I'm always awake
No, I never snooze
Two foreign bitches can't remember who is who
They do not know what to do with me
I'm a loose screw
Tell me what more do I gotta prove
You comparing me to who?
Watch who you compare to me
That lil girl is way behind
Tell her catch up to my speed
It could never be us, it could never be we
'Cause it was I always, who was the one working
I got the occupation of a waitress, but it ain't food that I'm serving
I don't check the price when I purchase
I'll never be scared of no person
Don't make me make you meet some doctors and nurses
Magnifying glasses, these bitches be lurking

[Hook]
I knew it was a reason I ain't go to school
Now I'm a boss and I'm makin' my own moves
When you get up, gotta watch how you move
I make it do what it do, yeah!
I knew it was a reason I ain't go to school
Now I'm a boss and I'm makin' my own moves
When you get up, gotta watch how you move
I make it do what it do, yeah yeah!
I make it do what it do, yeah
I make it do what it do, yeah
I make it do what it do
I make it do what it do, yeah
I make it do what it do, yeah
Yeah
I make it do what it do, yeah!

[Verse 2]
That money'll change situations
I ain't pregnant, but the money I'm craving
Shit, my pockets look like they had a baby
Me and Benjamin, we should be related
How much I'm around him, you would think I knew him
If hustlin' a language, then I speak it fluent
I don't talk about it, no I'ma just do it
You took a shot and you missed it, bitch you blew it
I knew it, I knew they was hatin'
But I knew the chance was comin', so I was just waitin'
I'm patient
I did what I had to do, so I ain't never stressin' bout no paper
Bitch you should cake up
You need to wake up
I blow it and get it back, you gotta save up
I know how the game go, so they cannot play us
The money like leaves, so you know I'ma rake up
Smokin' OG gas, I ain't smoking vapors
I got different plugs, so I'm mixing the flavors
I'm young and I'm ballin', should play for the Lakers
I did it on my own, I ain't need no favors
Made double XXL and I made it to Fader
Worried bout myself, I never been a hater
I know they don't wanna see me make it
But I come up from nothing, can't stop til I made it

[Hook]
I knew it was a reason I ain't go to school
Now I'm a boss and I'm makin' my own moves
When you get up, gotta watch how you move
I make it do what it do, yeah!
I knew it was a reason I ain't go to school
Now I'm a boss and I'm makin' my own moves
When you get up, gotta watch how you move
