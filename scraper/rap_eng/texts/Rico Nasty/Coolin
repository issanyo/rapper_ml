Verse: I'm just coolin , always movin , have them groovin to my music . oh yeah this sauce , oh yeah this style you know I'm never gonna lose it , they try to stop me , try to drop me , try to take me out my zone
I be risin, I be climbin , I do this shit alone
Wait I got this team ,I got this set they be really lookin out
They be holdin me down , they dont care bout no clout
I got my shawty rockin with me yeah 24/7
If I'm not fuckin with yall energy then just get to steppin
Cuz I be coolin

Don't see no Ls you will never catch me losin
I'm still on drive I be cruisin
Y'all not sleepin anymore y'all just snoozin
Drivin on the fast lane
Just tryna get this cash mane
Married to this music , but this money got my last name
Not worried bout no obstacles not thinkin bout the past mane
I just keep on movin keep on pushing as I elevate
Fuck the hate

Get some , pickin all these fights baby when you gonna win some ?
I just got a lump sum
Wave it in your face and i dare you try to take some
