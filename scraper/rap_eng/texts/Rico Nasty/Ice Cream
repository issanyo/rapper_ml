[Intro]
Woah Kenny
Hello? Rico!
Yeah, Rico!
What? Rico!
Huh yeah, Rico!

[Verse 1]
With some white bitches screamin' YOLO
Lemonade for the shade, Jesus saves, I don't
Pussy taste like ice cream, come and get this strawberry yum-yum
Put it in his face, now he got a candy crush
I call that a sugar rush, he call me his sugar plum
He call me his little princess, I call him my sponsor
He know that I'm crazy, he call me his little monster
Bitches ain't even eatin' pasta, bitch I'm eatin' lobster

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ice cream truck
When the niggas see me, all the boys want some
All the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks
I seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, "Ew! What the fuck?"
Huh huh-huh, I'm the ice cream truck
When the niggas see me, all the boys want some
All the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks
I seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, "Ew! What the fuck?"
Huh yeah

[Verse 2]
He tried it, I denied it like shit, duh
He text my phone, I ain't replyin' like shit
That nigga broke, I can tell, it's like a sixth sense
Bitches real mad but, how more mad can you get?
In real life I'm a shark, you a goldfish
Here's my dick real quick, can you hold it?
Bitches these days gettin' bolder and bolder
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders
But I'm still

[Chorus]
I'm the ice cream truck
When the niggas see me, all the boys want some
All the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks
I seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, "Ew! What the fuck?"
Huh huh-huh, I'm the ice cream truck
When the niggas see me, all the boys want some
All the niggas want reed, bitch your boyfriend sucks
I seen a nigga tweet me, I was like, "Ew! What the fuck?"
Huh yeah

[Outro]
