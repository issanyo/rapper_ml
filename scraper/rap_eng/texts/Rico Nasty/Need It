[Intro]
Yeah, haha
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, I need it
I need it, yeah-yeah
I need it, yeah, I need it
I need it, I need it
Rico, Rico, yeah

Rico, Rico, Sugar Trap haha

[Verse 1]
I grab my dogs out the kennel
Got your blue benjis, you twinning
I ain't got time for no chilling
I only got time for some millions
He say I'm bad like a villian
He wanna give me his children
I just wanna touch a billion
Rocking out like Jimi Hendrix
I'm in his mouth like a dentist
I pray to God he could finish
I only wanna see commas
I ain't got time for no drama
But if I got drama I solve it
Bitches be ducking and dodging
But can't dodge them hits when they coming on
Act like a bitch when I'm coming
Them guns as big as Andre Drummond
They sound like thunder when they thumping
Blood on my hands came from rumbling
Is you hungry, is you lunching?
Lil ho you came here for nothing
Smack a bitch out with my hands
Then I go buy some new Vans
I just got blood in my Vans
And I just got paid in advance
I could be moving too fast but I swear I won't crash
He just might go through the dash
He smacking all on her ass
If we racing then you laugh
Girl you don't know all the facts
I think you need to relax, yeah

[Verse 2]
He call me an animal, he say I'm evil
Maybe I'm just on my people
Maybe I just wanna leave you
Maybe the money in the way
Yeah I just can't seem to see you
I'm so fed up with these people
He gave me head, it was decent
But not good enough to keep me
New foreign bitch, call her Mimi
Bring me that money, I need it
I don't need the change, keep it
No Mike Jackson, he gon' beat it
If he cheat, I'ma leave him
He a bitch, you can keep him
Smack a bitch for no reason
Came three times like Adidas
Hate these bitches, they some leaches
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
