[Verse 1]
Pointing red lasers on you
Do you need a head start?
Playing with the wrong bitch
I don’t think you're too smart
Good head, you would think he went to Harvard
Can’t ride my wave, getting knocked off
Going up in flames when I’m pissed off
Designer all day when I go shop
No ID, when I club hop
Got an old bitch, think I need a new dog
I can see it in her face, she don’t want nothing
She want me to put her on like lotion
They all want the clout and I know this
But I just want the money, I’m focused

[Hook]
I got a Ar-15 in the closet
In case a bitch want to start shit
I got a lot of Benjamin’s in my pocket
Just in case I want to buy it
I got a Ar-15 in the closet
In case a bitch want to start shit
I got a lot of Benjamin’s in my pocket
Just in case I want to buy it

[Verse 2]
All these niggas copy cats, and they piss poor
I need a Benz truck and a rarri, four door
She just took some molly, but she needed more
LSD tripping me, by the sea shore
Baby girl, what you mad at me for?
Swerving in a Audi, yeah I made a detour
You can’t hang with me bitch, cause you too poor
Smack a bitch out, with my skateboard

[Hook]
I got a Ar-15 in the closet
In case a bitch want to start shit
I got a lot of Benjamin’s in my pocket
Just in case I want to buy it
I got a Ar-15 in the closet
In case a bitch want to start shit
I got a lot of Benjamin’s in my pocket
Just in case I want to buy it

[Outro]
Woah
Who, what?
Sugar Trap, yeah!
Huh? Why? Why?
