[Chorus]
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?

[Verse 1]
Everyday I wake up feelin' like I need my life back
Ridin' on the money train, think I'm on the right track
If we take it from you, you ain't gonna get shit back
I got bitches on stand-by, they'll take your shit fast

[Pre-Chorus]
Long hair, nails done, bitches hatin'
Don't be mad 'cause you look basic
I roll grams up and I face it
You know that I stay in the latest

[Chorus]
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?

[Verse 2]
Struggling to hold on, the show must go on
Some only came for one song
Some prolly sing the whole set
I been in the worst moods, I been upset
I been havin' mood swings, sayin' shit that I can't take back
I got all this money but I wanna go back
They keep on askin' where the old me at
For the last time, she ain't never comin' back

[Pre-Chorus]
Long hair, nails done, bitches hatin'
Don't be mad 'cause you look basic
I roll grams up and I face it
You know that I stay in the latest

[Chorus]
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
Don't let life pass you by, waste money on what I buy
I don't know why, oh why? I don't know why, oh why?
