[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah
Oh yeah yeah
Oh my God
Oh yeah yeah
Rico-Rico
Yeah

[Chorus 1]
And I walk like a marathon
Just to see your face or to feel your arms
They say time heals pain
But mine still ain't gone
I see you up there tryna make a way
I know you hate about the things I did
And the things I've seen, and the things I said
I made a lot of mistakes that I still regret
But bitches ain't in my place, so they can't talk shit
I was with you today and every day before
Oh-ooh-oh

[Verse]
You would smoke a whole ounce and it still wouldn't phase you
Started drinkin' lean, I told you, "doctor drugs ain't safe boo"
Watch yourself and watch your health
'Cause when you here you only got one life to live
I give it to much, now it's time I get
I've been grindin' so hard like my time is near, yeah
The good or the bad one
And a new car, you know it's a fast one
I'ma make this year better than the last one
Niggas want a cut and they just mad I slid past them
No debit, I just cash out
Bitches hatin' but still have they hand out
What happened to the competition? Man down
Remember rappin' in my mirror, I got fans now
Remember starin' at my ceilin' 'bout to crash out
God sent me a signal, go get 'em, go get it, I'm winnin'
You hatin', I get it, won't stop 'til I'm finished
This just the beginnin'
Yeah, yeah-yeah
This just the beginnin'
Won't stop 'til I'm finished

Won't stop 'til I'm finish, this just the beginnin'
Yeah-yeah, oh

[Chorus 2]
And I walk like a thousand miles
Just to see your face and be in your arms
Since you've been away
I've been grindin' hard to be everything
Yeah, that we talked about
Oh yeah
And I walk like a thousand miles
Just to see your face and be in your arms
Since you've been away
I've been grindin' hard to be everything
Yeah yeah, that we talked about
