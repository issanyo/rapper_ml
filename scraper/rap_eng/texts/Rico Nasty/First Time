[Intro: Rico Nasty]
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Rico, Rico, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
First time I saw you I knew, yeah-yeah
First time we locked eyes I knew

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
Like yeah, first time I saw you
I knew he gon' be my boo
Got designer on his shoes
He's so cute
Watching how he move, he a boss nigga
And he always leggin, I think I love this nigga
I keep stalking him on twitter
If he ever liked a picture
I'ma get him, I'ma bag him
I'ma grab his ass up
And if he got a bitch I don't really give a fuck
I always get what I want, yeah-yeah, oh
I think that he's a trap star cause he always got the dope
But he might play football, baby boy built like the Hulk
He might be a rapper, I don't know
I gotta know, I wanna know

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
First time I saw you I knew, yeah-yeah
First time we locked eyes I knew

[Verse 2: Tino Loud]
Yeah who the fuck is that?
I gotta have her
Scrolling down my timeline like I gotta bag her
She tweeted "what he waiting for?" I know the reason
She favorite one more picture and I'm diving in them DMs
I hate a bougie bitch and shawty savage
She might just make me chase her but I know she worth the challenge
I don't know a nigga here so I know them (?) ain't damage
I don't know she mixed with Spanish
Let a real nigga handle
Like Drake I'm tryna make you my go to
Girl it's so much I can show you
I know that I don't really know you
But that's bout to change like a toll booth
When you mine I won't say that I told you
Hoes on my line, gotta give 'em the boot
I'ma make 'em real comfortable like sweat suits
Try and give you (?) I won't stress you, damn

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
First time I saw you I knew, yeah-yeah
First time we locked eyes I knew
First time I saw you I knew, yeah-yeah
First time we locked eyes I knew
