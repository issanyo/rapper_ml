[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ah-ah
Rico-Rico, yeah, haha
Yeah, yeah, Rico, Rico, yeah
Like yeah-yeah
Oh my God, oh my God

[Chorus]
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
I don't care, yeah

[Refrain]
I'm making moves, I'm doin' what I wanna do
Don't ever like to trust myself when it comes to you
I'm only worried about money and revenues
Scary ass bitches remind me of Scooby Doo
Smoking OG feeling like I'm on Looney Tunes
We twisting backwoods all day like a Rubik's Cube
Monkey nuts on that chopper look like mini hula hoops
We teach you a lesson better than school'll do
Make your move

[Verse 1]
Make it how you want it
We can do this shit in private or in public
If we ain't talking money then it won't be no discussion
Stop all the bluffing
What's in your pockets nigga? Can't see nothing
What's in my pockets? A bunch of blue hundreds
I work hard for this boy, I didn't get lucky
I'm eatin' good while you sittin' there munchin'
Nigga you lunchin'
Bread make me walk with a limp, I need crutches
Only worried about the numbers
Money come to me in clusters
Niggas talking, they some busters
Yellow diamonds look like buses
If you got it then I rush ya
I'm never folding under pressure
Just bought a designer umbrella so I can flex on a bitch in any weather, yeah

[Chorus]
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
Feeling like counting my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
I don't care, yeah

[Verse 2]
Chasin' this money but I'm never rushin'
I got a new pistol, the best ones is Russian
Don't blow my house down with that huffin' and puffin'
You got a big mouth but you not goin' do nothing
I'm out making moves, I'm making moves

[Refrain]
I'm making moves, I'm doin' what I wanna do
Don't ever like to trust myself when it comes to you
I'm only worried about money and revenues
Scary ass bitches remind me of Scooby Doo
Smoking OG feeling like I'm on Looney Tunes
We twisting backwoods all day like a Rubik's Cube
Monkey nuts on that chopper look like mini hula hoops
We teach you a lesson better than school'll do
Make your move, yeah
Just make your move, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
Anywhere that I be at is a move
When I turn up at my show it's a move
Feeling like countin' my money, my mood
Pussy niggas tryna fuck up my groove
People be calling me rude, yeah
I don't care, yeah

[Outro]
Oh my God, haha
Oh my God
Yeah-yeah, haha
Yeah
