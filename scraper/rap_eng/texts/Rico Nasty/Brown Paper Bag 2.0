[Intro: both]
Breathe in, breathe out
(My daily meditation)
Breathe in, breathe out
(Rico, Rico)
Breathe in, breathe out
You keeping me from fainting
Breathe in, breathe out

[Verse 1: Yoshi Flower]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Go put that money in that
In a brown paper bag when you're capped out of racks
And a bad habit flashback
You kept a stash at the shits like Slash with the licks
How I wish we could could kick back, ohh
Try to feel that you felt when it's real
And how I wish that I had all the things that I like
Lots of gas so you gotta get rich real fast, yeah

*Intrumental break*

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Hahahaha, yeah
I know I ain't the cutest bitch walkin'
But I might be the realest bitch talkin'
Growin' up I ain't never really had shit
Talk tough but we know you ain't 'bout shit
I just spat 'bout 10 thousand
I'm just an Italian, yeah
I just left from the islands
Sun settin' when I'm landin'
Cat act like I understand it

*Instrumental break*

[Verse 3: Both]
I ain't got mine, I don't need yours
City every night, sold out shows
You been with me through it all
When everyone let me down
We should know by now how the games always
Always stay ten toes, woah, woah, yea

[Bridge: both]
Breathe in, breathe out
(Yeah, yeah)
Breathe in, breathe out
(Give us, oh)
Breathe in, breathe out(woah)
(My daily meditation)
Breathe in, breathe out
That's why I keep you around

*Break*

[Outro]
Breathe in, breathe out
Yeah, oh
