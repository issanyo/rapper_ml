[Hook]
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me

[Verse 1]
He told her the same things he told me
Said he loved her laugh, he told me the same thing
We was just chilling then I heard his phone ring
He ain’t wanna answer so I had to do my thing
I was asking him some questions, he think he smarter than me
Why you have to click ignore before the name pop on the screen?
Do you know how many niggas would kill just to be with me
Even breathe the air I breathe
Oh no, how could this be?
He tried to play it off and that’s when I knew
That after all the bullshit that he put me through
He was lying through his teeth I had to find out who
You think you gonna play with me but I don’t think so boo
Yeah yeah!

[Hook]
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me

[Verse 2]
I let it go because I ain't have no evidence
But time and time again this bitch keeps popping up again
She trying hard to get noticed
Then he play her like he ignored the bitch
But why this nigga lying ‘bout it, that’s the part that got me, bitch
I’m just playing stupid cause he still giving me money
Niggas think they buying love, you taking bitches shopping
I don’t need your money, lil’ nigga my pockets poppin’
Lying ass nigga you only good as an option
Yeah!

[Hook]
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
He told her the same things he told me
