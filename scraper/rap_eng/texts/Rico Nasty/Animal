[Refrain]
I'm a bear, you a mother fuckin' reindeer
Where I stay, you can't mother fuckin' stay there

[Verse 1]
Keep them kids like a mother fuckin' daycare
Don't like how I sing, bitch I don't care
Smokin' on OG peach, can't get my mind clear
Bad bitch, she with me, she got curly hair
When we get to the trap bitch, don't stare
Lot of guns, lot of packs, lot of dope sellin'
And if you ain't know bitch, we don't do no tellin'
If you a pussy we gon' smell it like it's dope on ya

[Chorus]
Went to ya hood, they like, "we'on even know shawty"
Design it up, lookin' sweet, I don't need no stylist
If ya nigga look at me it ain't no challenge
Bitches want beef with me but they can't manage
Got my tool, grab the heat, let's have a camp fire
You talk a lot but you ain't got none to talk about
If it ain't money comin' out bitch, shut ya mouth
Pistol whip ya ass and now she fallin' on the ground
Screamin', shoutin' in the street like she at church
I'm that bitch, diss you on your own shit, go and check the verse
I'm the one they lookin' at cause I'm the one who did it first
I got hot up on the beat so you could call me Lava Girl
Once he heard of Sugar Trap, he wanna come into my world
Choppa make him break dance, call that shit the sugar twirl

[Refrain]
I'm a bear, you a mother fuckin' reindeer
I'm a bear, you a mother fuckin' reindeer
I'm a bear, you a mother fuckin'- mother fuckin'
Where I stay, you can't mother fuckin' stay there

[Verse 2]
If she postin' it, I doubt that she gon' blow the shit
It's OG gas I'm rollin' it
No bacon, ion talk to pigs
Bitches know what's up with me
I'm living lavish, luxury
Money don't mean nothing
Them cubics on you, you look broke to me

[Chorus]
Went to ya hood, they like, "we'on even know shawty"
Design it up, lookin' sweet, I don't need no stylist
If ya nigga look at me it ain't no challenge
Bitches want beef with me but they can't manage
Got my tool, grab the heat, let's have a campfire
You talk a lot but ya ain't got none to talk about
If it ain't money comin' out bitch, shut ya mouth
Pistol whip ya ass and now she fallin' on the ground
Screamin', shoutin' in the street like she at church
I'm that bitch, diss you on your own shit, go and check the verse
I'm the one they lookin' at cause I'm the one who did it first
I got hot up on the beat so you could call me Lava Girl
Once he heard of Sugar Trap he wanna come into my world
Choppa make him break dance, call that shit the sugar twirl
