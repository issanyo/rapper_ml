[Chorus]:
Lately I been thinking ‘bout a bag, no laundry
Lately I been making bitches mad, niggas want me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in his two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep
Lately I been all about my paper, no loose leaf
Lately I been putting pressure on 'em, bitches know me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in his two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep

[Verse 1 - bbymutha]:
Can’t keep, these niggas can’t keep up with a bitch like me
These bitches can't figure out that i am not they enemy
Beefing with your mutha just like beefing with yourself
I be giving bitches knowledge they just put me on the shelf
Free game, oh you mad, huh?
You was missing out cause you was plotting on my bag, huh?
You was suckin dick for clout and i was simply suckin dick for paper, play or pleasure
And you wonder why you looking like a lesser, do the work, bitch
Blame it on whatever but I really do the work, bitch
Slow and steady wins the race so pop another perc, bitch
You don’t wanna see me it’s a pistol in my skirt, bitch
I'll never belong to you forever, i'm too clever, hoe
It’s levels to my loving, I can't give you more for less
When we matching I ain’t talking kicks, I’m talking bout a check
I can’t boss these niggas up no mo’ I’m pressure on they necks
I ain’t tryna live in vain and I ain’t tryna die in debt, bitch

[Chorus]:
Lately I been thinking ‘bout a bag no laundry
Lately I been making bitches mad, niggas want me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in his two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep
Lately I been all about my paper, no loose leaf
Lately I been putting pressure on 'em bitches, know me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in his two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep

[Verse 2 - Rico Nasty]:
Lately I been feeling like my money too long
I can’t break it down ‘cause the weed too strong
She hate on my music but she still sing along
I bet that bitch gon’ diss me in her new hit song
If you hating on me, please, go get a job
I been stunting on ‘em hard - don’t need a cause
These bitches be watching me just like a hawk
If it ain’t money coming out ya mouth, you shouldn’t even talk

[Chorus]:
Lately I been thinking ‘bout a bag no luggage
Lately I been making bitches mad niggas want me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in this two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep
Lately I been all about my paper, no loose leaf
Lately I been putting pressure on 'em bitches, know me
I was in a rush I had to fuck him in this two seat
We be on the hush, it ain’t a secret that he can’t keep
