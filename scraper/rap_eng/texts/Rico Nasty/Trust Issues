[Intro]
Yeah, Rico
Kennyyy

[Verse 1]
They keep tryin' hard to get at me but I don't think it's stickin'
They only wanna beef with me because they see me winnin'
It's diamonds in my ear, so it's hard for me to listen
Bitch, I'm worth a check, I bet you want for me to hit you
We ain't that close, I bet you wanted me to kiss you
Outfit sick, I should be walkin' with a tissue
Bitch, I'm a dog, but I just broke up out the kennel
Car paid for, cash, and you ridin' in a rental
Diamonds in my dental, crazy in my mental
Stab you with a pencil if you don't get the memo
This shit too simple, smokin' on indo
Racks in my pocket, so it made me limp slow
I just got to the party so I'm gonna sip mo'
Pockets fat, so you know they won't fold
She just popped a bean, I ain't talkin' 'bout a pinto
If you lookin' for me, I be everywhere you can't go

[Chorus]
I'm with the shit, good or bad, either way it go
If you got a problem wit' me, can you let me know?
I-I-I-I got a lotta issues, I try not to let 'em show
I got trust issues, don't nobody get too close
I got dough like a roll, choppa make 'em hit dem folks
I-I-I-I got a Cali plug, he pull up on me in some locs
Walkin' through the airport and I got a Fendi tote
Ridin' with my bitches and we stay with plenty poles

[Verse 2]
Talk shit, adiós, I need my money vámonos
I like cheese, no nachos, they like, "where you get those?"
I touch mo' money than a bitch who work at Wells Fargo
I got people turnin' heads everywhere that I go
Kenny on the beat, so you know the beat fye
Talkin' too much, my niggas pull up with that fye
Five grams to the face, bitch, that's a high five
You work a nine to five, I make nine bands five times
Guns like we in the army, hope you roger that
You tryna get a follow back and I be where the dollars at
I make mo' money than my old teachers and I'm proud of that
You thought you was teachin' me, well, bitch, I shoulda taught yo' ass
I hope that they ready for it, life come at you fast
Whatever you say outcha mouth you gotta stay true to that
I hopped in a foreign, I might just do the dash
Rich bitch in the passenger, I hope I don't fuckin' crash

[Chorus]
I'm with the shit, good or bad, either way it go
If you got a problem wit me, can you let me know?
I-I-I-I got a lotta issues, I try not to let 'em show
I got trust issues, don't nobody get too close
I got dough like a roll, choppa make 'em hit dem folks
I-I-I-I got a Cali plug, he pull up on me in some locs
Walkin' through the airport and I got a Fendi tote
Ridin' with my bitches and we stay with plenty poles
