[Intro]
Rico-Rico, Rico-Rico
Rico-Rico, Rico-Rico
Who is Mike going crazy
Aye

[Verse 1]
I just went to Benihana and I’m smokin' sheets and funnel
You a wannabe, who wanna be, I’m only ‘bout the commas
See me in the street on any day, I’m really ‘bout that drama
And you know I keep the heat on me, ain’t talkin' bout the summer

[Hook]
Smoking Key Lime OG and this car got two seats
When I hop out it dank, you can smell it on me
Handle that shit myself, I ain’t gon’ call police
Keep that bitch on a leash
Or keep that bitch from 'round me
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Walkin' wit' a attitude like, what’s the problem?
I'ont hang with DMX, I’m with some Ruff Ryders
Gas got me high as shit but no, I ain't the pilot
I'm the whole meal you hangin' with a whole biter
I was hustlin' when these niggas was wearing Spyder
And I’m servin' like I’m workin' in a fuckin' diner
Bitch I been the flame, I just need a lighter
I’m a doer all these bitches lookin' like some mighters
With the touch I got the Midas
Drinkin' Ace of Spades, you drinkin' apple cider
When I see that hoe, I’ma fuckin' fight her
Mike Tyson, I’ma fuckin' bite her
Huh, shit! Where my lighter?
I know that I’ll be the best, Ion need no title
Walk up in the ring, who my fuckin' rival?
Nigga fuck that, go grab the rifle
Spray the champagne, my niggas get to wildin'
Got yo bitch mad, she saying we childish
I’m just tryna flex on anyone who doubting
Your jewelry fake, boy, it’s lookin' real cloudy
I’m fresh to death, my outfit ‘bout to have a bounty
Walk up in the club, they don’t pat down me
I’m gettin' money while these bitches out here loungin'
Been workin' all week, my bank account astoundin'

[Hook]
Sm-smoking Key Lime OG and this car got two seats
When-when I hop out it dank, you-you can smell it on me
Handle that shit myself, I-I ain’t gon’ call police
Keep that bitch on a leash
Or keep that bitch from 'round me
Sm-smoking Key Lime OG and this car got two seats
When-when I hop out it dank, you-you can smell it on me
Handle that shit myself, I-I ain’t gon’ call police
Keep that bitch on a leash
Or keep that bitch from 'round me
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Smoking Key Lime OG
And this car got two seats (Rico)
When I hop out it dank
You can smell it on me (on me)
Handle that (Rico) shit myself (Rico, Rico, Rico, Rico)
I ain't gon' call police (when I hop out)
Keep that bitch on a leash (woah)
Yeah, yeah
