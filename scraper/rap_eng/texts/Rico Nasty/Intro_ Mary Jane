[Intro]
Haha, hold up, this shit is recording? Fuck
Aye shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up, haha, fuck

[Verse]
Is your niggas tryna mack me
Bitches wanna ride
I don't speak no french but we can be (?)
My life is a movie with thoughts on my side
And I got hella niggas cause I'm hella fly
My mama be tripping, she say that I bang
But I got hella grass, look out for the snakes
They plotting on me, they smile in my face
But niggas be trying, can't keep up the pace
I roll with the blunt, my eyes feel the haze
You bitches spark me, you feeling the shame?
I'm loving a bitch
She go by the name of Mary Jane
