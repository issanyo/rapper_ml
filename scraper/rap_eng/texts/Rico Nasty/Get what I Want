Rico:  Yeah yeah! Rico Rico! Rico Rico! I still get it out the trap!

Hook:

No You ain't put up

So you ain't Hittin My Blunt

I Gotta Run It up

So I can Get what I want

And I just took an L

It's about gettin Back

I'm still makin Plays

I still Get it out the Trap





I gotta Run It up

So I Can get what I Want

I'm tryna run me up a check

And Back the Bentley Out the front

They hate to see me Ball

Don't wanna see a Nigga stunt

They try & take me out the game

I keep the Nina In the cut

I'm jus out Here Grinding

For the House up on the Hills

I'm tryn Buy My Mom a House

I’m tryna pay my mama Bills

I'm Trappin for a Mil

And I been Rappin for a Deal

They Janked my Brother out his life

My nigga shit been gettin Real

I jus Wanna Double What I'm makin’ In the trap


They don't feel a Nigga struggle

Take an L and Gt it back

No you ain't put up so you ain’t hittin’  my blunt

I’m tryna make my mama’ proud & back the Bentley Out the front




Hook:

No You ain't put up

So you ain't Hittin My Blunt

I Gotta Run It up

So I can Get what I want

And I just took an L

It's about gettin Back

I'm still makin Plays

I still Get it out the Trap

Rico Nasty:

When you repeat the shit I say

Make sure you sayin’ the truth

I been gettin’ money since I hopped in the booth

Diamonds on my ear, and Diamonds all on my tooth

If you fuck with opps then I can’t fuck wit you

Smokin’ on this gas give a fuck `bout you

What’s the point of talkin’ shit, if the shit ain’t true?

I don’t know these niggas or these bitches, who is you?

Mad at a bitch, nigga you look like a fool

Mad cause I’m rich nigga go make you some moves

Run up on a hoe like Biggie, bitch gimme the loot

Gotta pay me to dispute

I dont fuck with hoes in groups

Babygirl go & do you!


Hook:

No You ain't put up

So you ain't Hittin My Blunt

It's about gettin Back

I'm still makin Plays

I still Get it out the Trap
