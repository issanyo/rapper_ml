[Intro]
Rico, Rico

[Hook]
I don't want to 'cause my bruh already hit dat
See me smokin' dope, don't ask if you can hit dat
In my Audi tryna find out where the roof at
Need a new car, tell me where the Coupe at

[Verse 1]
Posting pictures but we know that you won't shoot dat
I'm a bad bitch, baby, I'm a cool cat
See you big mad, I just spent a big bag
Designer mix-match, tell me where you get dat
If she get close, tell that hoe to get back
She want no smoke, she just want attention
Got 'em stressin', I can feel the tension
Not to mention, I be money spendin'

[Hook]
I don't want to 'cause my bruh already hit dat
See me smokin' dope, don't ask if you can hit dat
In my Audi tryna find out where the roof at
Need a new car, tell me where the Coupe at
I don't want to cause my bruh already hit dat
See me smokin' dope, don't ask if you can hit dat
In my Audi tryna find out where the roof at
Need a new car, tell me where the Coupe at

[Verse 2]
I'm a bad bitch baby, you a catfish
Make you disappear, you'd think I'd know magic (poof)
That's my old flow, I'ma let you have it
Bitch I ain't lucky, you know that I planned this
Somewhere in the sky, I don't think I'm landin'
Know they want my spot, but they cannot have it
Your opinion - you can keep it
Don't really need it, I hope you can see dis

[Hook]
I don't want to 'cause my bruh already hit dat
See me smokin' dope, don't ask if you can hit dat
In my Audi tryna find out where the roof at
Need a new car, tell me where the Coupe at
I don't want to cause my bruh already hit dat
See me smokin' dope, don't ask if you can hit dat
In my Audi tryna find out where the roof at
Need a new car, tell me where the Coupe at
