[Hook]
He wanna know why I don't call him no more
He keep saying that he misses my voice, yeah
He told his friends that he think I'm the one
He wanna make love to me, I use him for fun

[Verse 1]
He wanna be my boo but he just my toy
Playin games with his head, no bunny, play boy
Baby boy I am so sorry that I lead you on
So I wrote you an apology and put it in a song
You're mad I friendzoned you, you're mad and I'm wrong
But all you want is clout and I cannot put you on
All you're gonna do is leach on to my friends
Baby you are not my type, I cannot pretend
Rather this than reject you
Please don't make me get disrespectful
We could never be something special
You are just my friend you will never be my next boo, sorry

[Hook]
He wanna know why I don't call him no more
He keep saying that he misses my voice
He told his friends that he think I'm the one
He wanna make love to me I use him for fun

"Can I get some love?" No you can't nigga
