[Hook]
Watch me get that cash, bitch
Don't worry 'bout my past, bitch
'Cause every move I make, I make it better than the last, bitch
OoooooOOoOoooooOh
Smoking OG gas bags, when I'm in a drop top
Colored diamonds on my shit, they look just like pop rocks
OoooooOOoOoooooOh
Chopper in the trunk, it's as big as a boombox
And the clip longer than a motherfucking tube sock
OoooooOOoOoooooOh

[Verse]
They playing poker, they bluffing
I flex on that bitch, it ain't nothing
Don't care bout the season, no cuffing
I'm only cuffing that money
She'll do it all for a hundred, she hop on that dick like a bunny
Walk up on him, now he running
And all my music, she be bumping
But she ain't, 'cause she ugly
That clip hold 50, he keep dumping
Bitch I turned nothing to something
My pockets fat, just like a pumpkin
I put the money in a duffel
I don't know you, I can't trust you
No fast break, I gotta hustle
Rather show you than rebuttal
I'm chasing a sack, I can't cuddle
Y'all talk it over, go huddle
Put words together like it's Ruzzle
My jewelry dripping like a puddle
I can survive in the jungle
My shooter keep jacking my lumber
I swear to God I cannot fumble
My hair is long just like Rapunzel
Ain't talking if it ain't bout the numbers
Bitch we balling like the Thunder
Say that shit that make 'em wonder
Keep a tool just like a plumber
Bitch I need 3 for an onion
My pockets is soft like a dumpling
If we see you, we gon' crush you
Yeah, Yeah, OoooooOOoOoooooOh!

[Hook]
Watch me get that cash, bitch
Don't worry 'bout my past, bitch
'Cause every move I make, I make it better than the last, bitch
OoooooOOoOoooooOh

Colored diamonds on my shit, they look just like pop rocks
OoooooOOoOoooooOh
Chopper in the trunk, it's as big as a boombox
And the clip longer than a motherfucking tube sock
OoooooOOoOoooooOh
