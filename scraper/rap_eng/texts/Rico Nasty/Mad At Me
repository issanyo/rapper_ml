[intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I got hundreds in my pocket, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Like DJ Unc, I'll make 'em walk it out
Designer stepping when I'm walking now
I'm my own boss, I ain't clockin' out
My voice is a band, what you talkin' bout?
It's a band in my mouth we can't talk it out
Pull up on her, she ain't talkin' now
My niggas got water, no crocodiles
Keep a cannon on me, ain't no Wild 'n Out
Never leave a witness, they ain't findin' out
Fuck a bitch and I block her, I'm down and out
When I open my mouth they be bitin' now
I'm back in L.A. and I'm feeling like Biggie
Money the only thing that keep me busy
My niggas run shit like Ezekiel Elliott
Please don't mistake 'em for Missy
I run my city
Bitches ain't shook me and still cannot shake me
My alarm should be made out of money
That's the only thing that wake me
Brand new pistol and it came with a laser
All this talking but I swear it don't phase me
Bitches mad that they boyfriend don't want them but crave me
I need it now, I am waiting
That money it made me impatient
You'd think its my birthday, I'm cakin'

[Chorus]
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Is it 'cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?

[Bridge]
So I asked them why they mad at me, they did not have an answer
I swear these bitches can't touch me, I feel just like MC Hammer
Watch I turn up in the function, but I'm not a party planner
Now what's up boo? Why you so mad at me?
It's just a simple question
I told her to bring a friend along, a bad bitch is my preference
Where I'm at in life feel normal, I guess I was always destined
If you don't wanna help yourself, then I guess I just can't help you
Is it cause my sauce?
Is it cause my watch? I wanna know why they mad

[Chorus]
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Is it cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Yeah, yeah
Is it cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?
Why are they so mad at me?
Why are they so mad?
Yeah, yeah
Is it cause I got hundreds in my pockets and it makes them mad?
