[Intro]
Kenny Beats

[Verse 1]
When I hop out they gon’ call me Rico Blues
When I drop the top I turn that shit into a Coupe
It’s a new day, I need me a new boo
Countin’ blue faces to my favorite show Blue’s Clues
Put yourself in my shoes, you be me and I’m you
You like to play hide and seek, I can’t wait to find you
Diamonds on me blind you, ballin’ on em Cailou
I look good in every angle so you don’t like me beside you
Seven bitches, three lines, bitch, that’s a haiku
