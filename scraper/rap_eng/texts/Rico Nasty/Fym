[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Came from the struggle and all it took was some patience
I'm staying humble but you'll never catch me waitin'
I dreamed of this when we was sleeping in the basement
We barely speaking now, I swear I really hate this
'Cause you the reason why I made it and the reason why I hate the shit
Just calling to let you know, nigga, you ain't shit
On my flight, about to leave on some vacation shit
And I hope that you know you could've came with me
If you stayed with me, yeah
But I don't got time for the bullshit
Thank God I caught your ass with that new bitch
I'd rather die than to wait on that fairytale love shit
I just want to see the top
Grinding, I can never stop
Bitch, I don't fuck with no ops
I know they hate me a lot
Yeah, I know that they want my spot
These bitches can't do what I do
These bitches ain't from where I'm from
These bitches can't fuck with the kid
These bitches ain't really on nun'
Bout my money like religion
All you bitches ignorant copy kittens
I was just reminiscing
When I ain't even have a pot just to piss in
Daddy gone, yeah he in prison
Momma shuts him out the building
School don't really make a difference
Selling drugs with good intentions
Can't stop til' I'm sleeping with millions
Can't stop til' my momma got Benzes
Counting money screaming fuck all my exes
Middle fingers up like fuck all the fake friends
Got my money up now bitches wanna hate me
Yeah, yeah, bitches wanna hate me
I don't know what I did lately
Yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when your money sky high they say you sold your soul
Rumors don't get better, they just get more bold
I see you haters coming at me, I won't fold, yeah
No, no, I won't fold, God d-

[Chorus]
God damn, stunting on my ex bitch
God damn, all this ice on my necklace
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when your money sky high they say you sold your soul
Rumors don't get better, they just get more bold
I see you haters coming at me, I won't fold, yeah
No, no, bitch, I won't fold, yeah
Haha! Bitch Yeah yeah yeah, damn

[Chorus]
God damn, flexing on my ex bitch
God damn, all this ice on my necklace
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean, yeah
Fuck you mean

[Outro]
Whoo! It's lit!
