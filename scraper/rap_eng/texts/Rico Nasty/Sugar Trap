Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap

[Verse 1]
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
We got OG, we got powder, we got choppers and flowers
If you scared go call the opps 'cause we don’t welcome no cowards
We keeps sticks and when we spray it’s like a cinnamon shower
You’d think it’s diesel in the trap 'cause all we smoking is sour
I remember being broke, I used to dream about power
Now it’s bitches in the trap and they do what I desire
They can tell I’m on my shit 'cause all I put out is fire
These bitches wearing hand me downs, while I’m wearing designer
And I bet yo nigga know me, I might be his supplier
Sugar Trap, I’m on a mag, that’s why you bitches all sour
Always keep a pretty strap because it match my attire
She wanna hate me so bad, but secretly admire, yeah

[Hook]
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap
Welcome to my sugar trap, welcome to my sugar trap

[Verse 2]
Yeah, haha
You ain’t welcome in the trap if you ain’t gettin' no money
Broke ass niggas be so quick to try to take somethin' from me
We ain’t chefs up in this bitch, but bitch we stay with them onions
You know that we don’t follow rules, do what we want, we don’t suffer
See them hollows hit the air, no we don’t blink when we dumpin'
My bitches always with the shits, so don’t think about jumpin'
Got money all around the house, they know that we up to somethin'
These hoes be actin' all hard, but they soft as a muffin
I ain’t wanna pull your card, but I know you be bluffin'
We ain’t in here baking cakes, bitch it's pounds in the oven
Niggas love fake trappin', you ain’t getting no money
If we want it, we gon’ take it, run up on ‘em they runnin'
You ain’t never bust no heat bitch, I was raised in the jungle
Mix the sugar with the trap, they think that I’m up to somethin'
Got this shit all on my own ain’t need nobody for nothin'
How you expect to eat, and you don’t even know how to hustle?
Yeah yeah
