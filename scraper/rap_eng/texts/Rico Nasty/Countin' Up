[Intro]
Hello? Yeah bitch, I said I'm on my way
Hello? Yeah bitch, I said I'm on my way
The fuck? Bitch I'm coming the fuck?
Woah! Kenny! Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'm the bitch with the long hair and her top off
Talk tough, like a bottle top, we twist your top off
Had to hit the turn quick, just to get the narcs off
I'm the real deal shawty and you just the knock off
Shake it up, no Coca-Cola, I'm the one that pop off
Hit me on my Motorola if you need some narcos
I've been workin' every day, no, I ain't never call off
Talkin' shit on Instagram, that pistol make you log off
It's upsettin' that these bitches think they better than me
I got the bar too high and it's hard to beat
Gucci shades tint dark so it's hard to see
The easy part is gettin' money but it's hard to keep
I know you seein' that I'm busy so don't bother me
Like I passed every test, you ain't as smart as me
You a stunt double, shawty, you a wanna be
See me on the scene, you know that I charged the fee
Like yeah!

[Chorus]
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady countin' up
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady countin' up

[Verse 2]
You can't even handle a bitch like me
Make my own money, and I buy my own weed
Touch my wrist and your hand gon' freeze
Beggin' for the kitty on his hands and knees
Who you frontin' on? Come on girl, I know you a rookie
You got some followers, so what? Do you want you a cookie?
I got promoters throwin' shows so they can say that they booked me
When I walk up in the mall, they be turnin' and lookin'
No race, I went easy 'cause the pace I been pushin'
In the stew, I'm like a chef, they like, "Rico, what you cookin'?"
Probably one of these bitches' heads, I'm better than all the rest
No this is not a drill, hoe, this shit is not a test
I think you need to roll out, catch you actin' too hesitant
I bet you can't count all the money that I just spent
Niggas singin' to the feds like they Jazmine Sullivan
My racks too big, I just popped my rubber band

[Chorus]
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady countin' up
What? What? What? What? What? What?
Bitches on my dick, so what?
What? What? What? What? What? What?
It don't matter 'cause I'm steady countin' up
