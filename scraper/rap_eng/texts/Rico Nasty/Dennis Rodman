[Intro]
Oh my God
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
Ten different colored wigs all in my closet
I'm feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Different colored bills all in my pocket
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Ten different colored wigs all in my closet
I'm feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Different colored bills all in my pocket
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman

[Verse]
Why you got that gun, you only gon' cock it?
I got some bands in my pockets
Why you hatin'? You should stop it
If you're the plug, I'm the socket
Dirty money, I should wash it
Ten different colored wigs all in my closet
Feelin' just like Dennis Rodman
Bitches be searchin' and watchin'
My bitches be lurkin' with choppers
They put you to sleep like a doctor
That lil bitch is loud but I'm louder
I'm rollin' like you doin' sour
That packet right there need a shower
Bitches keep playin' with powder
You lil pussy, you coward
Just like Rebel I get rowdy
Shit I'm the bitch but she doubt me
Lil bitch you suck just like Downy
These niggas cannot arouse me
All your diamonds lookin' cloudy
Walk in the bank and I'm smilin'
I'm sick of these bitches they childish
Can't answer the phone cause I'm countin'
I can't stop until I need an accountant
Bitch I get high as a mountain
I'm makin' plays runnin' rounds and
I'm tryna buy a few houses
I'm just might flip a few ounces
Keepin' bad bitches like Dennis Rodman
I shoot your ass like a target
You bitches too out of pocket
Baby girl you need to stop it
You know that I keep a rocket
I just might make a deposit
Sat in the trap, they gon' mock me
I don't know why he keep calling
Xans make her walk like a zombie
Walk in and fuck up the party yeah

[Chorus]
Ten different colored wigs all in my closet
I'm feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Different colored bills all in my pocket
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Ten different colored wigs all in my closet
I'm feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Different colored bills all in my pocket
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Feeling just like Dennis Rodman

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
