[Intro]
Okay

[Verse]
I'm rolling up this sticky-icky
Wanna be my pretty kitty
MOB for life cause I know these bitches kinda iffy
Sexual seduction but my mind is corrupted
I can't give a nigga love cause my heart belongs to money
Honey, darling why you mad you
Say I can't be trusted, well lil nigga I never asked you
Wanna be my boyfriend, check in for me like you can
But nigga I'm single, you're a boy Peter Pan
I'm high off this Earth
This the death of the purp
If you talk wild shit
Fuck around and go miss 'em like an amber alert
Alert, nigga mayday, mayday
This nigga wearing fake BBC, crazy, crazy
Foolish jazz niggas
Fufu ass niggas
Put my tongue in the bullet cause I'm ruthless as niggas
All I want is money, I can't fuck with no broke bitch
Bitch you can't smoke with me
Cause my weed make her nervous
And she ain't coming home tonight or tomorrow
I can't pass her to the team unless she vows to swallow
These hollow tips spit like mambas
And I'll wet your ass your ass up like a toddler in pajamas
Then I'll take your bitch to Beni-fucking-hanas
Now she all up in my room, I got her hotter than a sauna
Just playing my nigga
I ain't gay my nigga but
If she cute I might slay my nigga
I'm ugly as shit
But I bet your nigga love me, he be all on my clit
He be telling me he love me like I really give a fuck
When I don't need no nigga, all I really need is drugs
And money, a whole lotta money
These bitches claim they real
I'll leave 'em sleeping in a snuggie
Snoring, your bitch boring
My bitch foreign
You a broke nigga which makes you unimportant
Money team, we some posh ass bitches nigga
Don't talk shit I swear to God you'll be missing
Now I'm all up on his mouth, no 'Yonce
And he wanna put a ring on it, fiance

[Outro]
This the outro, this the outro
My nigga this the outro
This the outro, this the outro
My nigga this the outro
