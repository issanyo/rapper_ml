[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
Tatted up from head to toe
Riding in a Range Rover
What we got up in this bitch?
I hope we don't get pulled over
Laying in a Cali king, I used to sleep on sofas
Life was a nightmare, I'd pray that shit was over

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
Lately it been better days, I been taking better ways
I like splurgin on designer things so it's real hard to say
I'm just being myself and for that they like to call me brave
Where you at? I'm getting paid
Smoking on the highest grade
Dipping, dodging, peasant paparazzi on a daily basis
I'm a Typhoon on these bitches that wanna ride my wave
Take a lot of bullshit just to phase me
You won't drive me crazy
I'd take money way before the fame
And oh my goodness gracious

[Chorus: Father]
Tatted up from head to toe
Riding in that Range Rover
What we got up in this bitch?
I hope we don't get pulled over
Laying in this Cali king, my shawty got that roll up
Shawty getting her throat fucked
Everybody know us
Yeah, yeah, bend that over, toe touch
Smoking on that potent
Damn that ass is rotund
Okay, and pull up in that bih
We on one, everybody on one
Everybody want some

[Verse 2]
Damn this girl is giving me the creeps
I'm glistening she watching me
All the way from 'cross the room
You know a nigga make 'em swoon
God damn I'm bent fam, ayo shawty hench fam
Ice water in my veins, fell in love with this fame
Geeked up, uh huh, I'm shaking, shawty think I'm twerking
Don't get it twisted nigga used to have that Nextel chirping
Shawty In love with excess, my American Express
I don't do this shit for the people
I'm greedy and I'm deceitful

[Chorus: Father]
Tatted up from head to toe
Riding in that Range Rover
What we got up in this bitch?
I hope we don't get pulled over
Laying in this Cali king, my shawty got that roll up
Shawty getting her throat fucked
Everybody know us
Yeah, yeah, bend that over, toe touch
Smoking on that potent
Damn that ass is rotund
Okay, pull up in that bih
We on one, everybody on one
Everybody want some
