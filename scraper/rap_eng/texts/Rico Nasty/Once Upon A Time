[Intro]
Once upon a time
Once upon a time
Once upon a time, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ha
Oohh

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time there lived a bad bitch
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
Couldn't go out, she's scared to show skin
Haters sending shots, but all them hoes missed
Heard what they was saying, but knew she couldn't quit
It was no debating 'cause she was that bitch
Knew she wasn't normal 'cause she didn't fit in
They was chasing niggas, she chased the Benjamin's
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
Sitting in her room she started a movement
Got a few fans, created a blueprint
Dropped her first tape and left them clueless
Doesn't care about your opinions so keep it
Designer on her clothes with diamonds all on her wrist
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
Walk up in the mall and spend a bitch rent
Now when I talk it's a check behind it
They take what I put out, I don't check behind it
When I swipe my card they don't decline it
Life ain't a movie you can't rewind it
Now when I say it they can't deny it
Once upon a time there lived a bad bitch
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
All she ever wanted to do was get rich

[Chorus]
Once upon a time there lived a bad bitch
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
Designer on her clothes with diamonds all on her wrist
Yeah, with diamonds all on her wrist
Once upon a time there lived a bad bitch
All she ever wanted to do was get rich
Yeah
Yeah
