[Intro]
(Fuck it up!)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I step out
Bitches stretch they neck out
I don't never stress bout
What the chitter-chat bout
Smack her in her damn mouth
Time to bring the dog out
Smoking got the fog out
I got green like a treehouse
Smoking og gas bags in a Backwood
You only good with yo man when you in the hood
You can not come alone but I wish you would
See me walking with a pick
Leave your ass in a pit
Smack a bitch till she spit
Blue money no Crips
See me walking with a limp
We gorillas no chimps
Going crazy in a VIP
Told her put it on her tongue
Now the party going dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Hook]
Now the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Smoking out the Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Do this shit for fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Got the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Now the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Smoking out the Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Do this shit for fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Got the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

[Verse 2]
Pull up in a Tahoe, and I'm smoking Tahoe
Bad bitch with me, looking like I hit the lotto
Your chain is looking hollow, I'm the boss I'm on the top floor
Money in a floor board, what you think I work for?
Party going dumb, I do what I want
We do this for fun, Bitch I'm smoking out the Uh
Rolling up the blunt rolling like a blunt
I do what I want, got the party going dumb, Bitch

[Hook]
Now the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Smoking out the Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Do this shit for fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Got the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Now the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Smoking out the Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh
Do this shit for fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Got the party goin dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb

Got the party goin dumb!
