[Intro]
Muah
(SK on the track)
Bali Baby
DJ Honorz what up nigga

[Verse 1: Bali Baby]
Clip hanging out my pocket like commas
I'ma go fuck up some commas
No I do not do the drama
My niggas ruthless, you know they might just bome shoot up at your mama
My Spanish bitch down, nah she don't say nada
So I take her shopping, Gucci and Prada
Had to ask her friends "What was here name?" Cause I forgot what they called her
All I know is chasing a dollar, I'm a dog, no collar
I might just go and wrap a fucking baller
Toting the sticks like we Harry Potter
She a fly on the wall, so I'ma swat her
I'm so icy when in sun I'm in water
They hate my music and they say that I taught her
You do what I do so you know you my daughter

[Hook: Bali Baby]
Put y'all all in my taxes
I'ma put y'all in my bracket
Yeah, put y'all in my taxes, y'all in my taxes
Yeah I'm gonna stack it, run up at Saks Fifth
Put y'all in my taxes, on my taxes

[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
All my niggas bad like they some bastards
All my children, I'm the trap daddy
Racks on me like I had a tennis rack
Wanna be me but you ain't in my bracket
Rich homie, called in rackets
Steady clip one in the head, I'm a savage
Jump out with Draco, Rico, go get nasty
I got stripes like New Balance
Go anywhere, nigga I trap with an Atlas
I [?] the cookie at it
I'm the coach where the [?] like John Madden
I'ma cover the set like a line backer
I'ma stunt like Givenchy, a slight dabber
Cut that shit out, I'm a [?]
Chop that shit up we some rare rappers
All my OG like ESPY, grandaddy, pussy

[Hook: Bali Baby]
Put y'all all in my taxes
I'ma put y'all in my bracket
Yeah, put y'all in my taxes, y'all in my taxes
Yeah I'm gonna stack it, run up at Saks Fifth
Put y'all in my taxes, in my taxes

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
Busting the pack out the plastic
Make you disappear like magic
And I'm balling like I'm Magic
These bitches hating, made me turn to a savage
He wanna know why they call me Rico Nasty
I bet I make you feel the pressure
I apply it and I won't let up
Smoking healthy just like lettuce
That clip way too long, you can't measure
Different ways to finesse
And I got several of these bitches biting, yeah they cloning me
Ain't never ducking no beef, ain't no ho in me
My pussy too good so he can't say no to me
And he keep trying to hit, you'd think he's smoking me
He from the city, he keep saying motor me
Not too many hitters look like a colony
Damn I meant colony
Think I had a dick the way these pussy niggas riding me, yeah

[Hook: Bali Baby]
Put y'all all in my taxes
I'ma put y'all in my bracket
Yeah, put y'all in my taxes, y'all in my taxes
Yeah I'm gonna stack it, run up at Saks Fifth
Put y'all in my taxes, on my taxes
