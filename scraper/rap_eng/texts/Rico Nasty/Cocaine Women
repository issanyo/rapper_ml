[Intro]
The kids are on drugs all the time, the problem is all the drugs

[Verse 1: Chris Madison]
Cocaine women in my old sniffing
White off a plane ticket
I can't say fame did it
Drugs in my veins tripping
No more games bitches
Parallel with pain killers
I can't feel my face nigga
Addicted to your ways
Prescription to the grave
That I dug myself today
Overdose (?) who can know
Your beauty's so delusional
Druggy with some clueless hoes
Uh, let me clear my nose, fuck
Keep my bitches, (?) close
Stay in clothes killing pussy
Leave in rows we some (?)

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
He might love me now but when he's sober he can't handle me
Says that I'm annoying, I ignore it, please just pass the weed
Druggie not a junkie, got cocaine, I keep that molly
You're a drug and I'm the addict
Yeah I think I formed a habit
Now my friends keep calling me crazy
They saying that you ain't shit and maybe
They could be right about that shit but right now I don't give a fuck
Cause tonight you looking good and I just rolled another blunt so

[Outro]
The kids are on drugs all right, the problem is they're on the wrong drugs. They're on a combination of processed sugar so they can be mini coke fiends. And mind narrowing processed crap like ridalin that doesn't open up their minds, it levels and controls them
