[Verse 1]

Diesel on me like a gas pump
Pockets fat like a baby bump
Turn any bitch to a damn slut
Only wanna get my bands up
Run down he goin give it up
Tryna pull up in a Bentley truck
Pop bottles when we hit the club
Cut a check for a concert
Blue benjis gotta work for em
Most bitches like to twerk for em
See my name and throw dirt on it
You preaching too much like a church sermon
You flexing forreal but your pockets hurting
Acting scary why you so nervous?
I'm a young bitch
So I'm still learning
I'ma learn how them M's work
Iont think I ever had a problem that I couldn't solve on my on my own time
Two bad bitches rollin dope and slutting for me at the same damn time
You say it's real but it don't shine
Say you rap but you can't rhyme
Yo bitch all on my line
I bet I'll make yo bitch..

Gay (x14)

[Verse 2]
Bitches be livin to hate
Fuck they opinion I'm movin the weight
Fuck her one night we ain't doin no dat-tin
Wait-bitch keep your bullshit you can sa-ve it
Smokin on thraxx think I'm bla-sian
Eyes the same color as sa-tan
I think he mad cause I ain't give em deal
I know he mad
Nigga fuck how you feel
Eatin good I ain't missin no meals
They see my wave and now they wanna swim
I keep the weight like a muhfukin gym
Rougers and 30s keep those on his hip
Blue benjis I ain't talking bout crips
Hennessy in my cup when I sip
Fuck around and boy you can get hit
Fuck around boy and you can split
Fuck around and I'll make you a lick
No janky niggas up in my clicque
Smokin cookies I ain't talkin bout crisps
Shooters good iont think they gone miss
That nigga goofy I ain't taking the risk
Give you chills from what's that on my wrist
I bet I'll make yo bitch..
