[Hook: Willz]
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them bad bitches in the back, tell them bitches match
All my niggas smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
I said, all I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them bad bitches in the back, tell them bitches match
All my niggas smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack

[Verse 1: Willz]
Slow motion cause the dope polling
And I'm roach holding, got these hoes going
Niggas dro tote, make these hoes roll
Like some low pros and they like get dos
But I blow smoke but these hoes know
I ain't sparking shit unless these hoes match it
Call it hashtag and she gon' back pass it
I'm a track bandit and a pack addict
Space ship lifted, that OG spliff
Taco missing, I smashed that kitten
She wet, no fishing, cause sex my mission
J's get burned in the air like incense
Sick with the flow
Laying the bitch, she take hits from the bowl
But least she gon' go for the squad
We all getting top
Roll up and roll I'm like you're not our block
Fingers fuck, trippy as hell
I smoke and inhale, my skin looking pale
Eyes low as a whale, (?)
My blunt super fat like I'm smoking a whale
All these niggas writing but they acting
They ain't with the shits
I just fucked your bitch, copped a vit
Now I'ma smoke that shit

[Hook: Willz]
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them bad bitches in the back, tell them bitches match
All my niggas smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
I said, all I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them bad bitches in the back, tell them bitches match
All my niggas smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
I ain't smoking on a budget
Copped an ounce just cause I want it
Bad bitch and she know it
My weed stronger than Hogan
Hoke, I buy my pot in bulk
Blowing O's is my speciality
Ask a nigga, he know
Bitch I'ma doja soldier
Super stoner, smoking purple drank and purple
Bitch I feel like Barney
Call up a nigga, tell him match me
I got foreigns, can you fuck with that or nah?
I got blue cheese and blue dream, promethazine
Codeine and Prozacs for the lowski
I'm the ganja queen
Sipping on that Actavis
Smoking on the loudest shit
Bitch you can't afford this shit
Smoke the pack is a lifestyle
You don't smoke enough so sit down
All I blow is pack, all I blow is loud

[Hook: Willz]
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them bad bitches in the back, tell them bitches match
All my niggas smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
I said, all I blow is pack, all I blow is pack
See them fuck niggas in the back, tell them niggas match
All my bitches smack, then you mad that your shit not thrax
All I blow is pack, all I blow is pack

[Verse 3: Billy]
All I blow is strong, Dollar Bills, yeah you know me
Smacked off the Prozac, percs is set, you know me
Nigga I stay cut then the trap
Doja niggas, yeah we always got the pack
Don't be mad at me, walking spot, yeah you know me
Dollar Bills the name and your ho, yeah she blow me
Like the J, I pass her to Jay
But it don't be a J, it be my dick
You be mad as shit
You know I be nutting in that bitch mouth nigga
I know you mad as shit, I know you sour nigga
Don't be mad at me, yeah you pouting nigga
But she topping, ohh
