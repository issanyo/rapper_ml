[Intro]
Yeah, Rico! Rico!
Oh my god

[Verse 1]
Whenever I don’t get my way, bitch, I get real belligerent
Have a pot to piss in, and now I’m pissing on ‘em and they sick
I need a doctor visit, tell me doctor, am I really sick?
He said I’m showing characteristics of being a snobby bitch
Yeah I’m a poppin’ bitch, and I know it ain’t hard for you to see
I used to watch TV and now I’m the bitch you seeing on TV
I pray to god that my thousands can turn into some millions
And to some billions, that’s just my everyday feeling
They keep on asking how I’m feeling
But shit, how would you feel?
Whenever everybody else is hungry and you serving the meals
I’m gripping the wheel, I’m praying that I don’t get a ticket
Even if you moving fast, the chance could still come and you’ll miss it
Apply it and risk it, cause everyday ain’t promised a visit
How you expect to learn anything when you talk more than listen?
[?] than bitten, they keep on sending shots but they missing
I invite bitches to my hotel room, and I got ‘em kissing
Getting money, the objective of all of my daily missions
Everybody got a problem with me, but I just don’t get it
I can’t even go nowhere no more, cause they want a picture
If money made out of lemonade, then I need me a pitcher
Smoking on some gold papers, bitch it shout when you hit it
You can’t get me out my character, cause I’m ‘bout my business
I’m with a white bitch, she snort more shit then Bobby and Whitney
They don’t like to hear the moves I make, cause they’re stuck in a pivot
They took the sauce and yeah I want it back, does that make me stingy?
They call me weird cause I don’t look like none of these other bitches
They can’t stand to see me when they cringe, when they see my picture
I already know I’m realer, and you don’t even know the difference
All my shit original and I don’t ever need a witness
When I’m talking money, you say what you say, cause you can’t comprehend it
Listening to Aretha Franklin, thumbing through some Benjamins
I mixed the molly with the Percocets, sounds like an even plan
Bitches wanna swag surf, cause they see I set the trends
Rico, what that bag worth? Bitch, you better not ask again
Getting on my damn nerves, I might swerve in the Benz
Bitches act like birds in the coupe I be in
Better snatch your girl when the troops walking in
So much smoke in the air, you think Snoop up in here
I got purple and I got that shit with fuzzy orange hair
For every bitch that's hating, I'ma put one in the air
