[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Sugar trap bitch
Haha haha
Rico-Rico

[Verse 1]
This ain't no motherfucking playground
Bitch we don't play 'round
I was wearing wigs
Think I'm moving on to braids now
Everything I do
Bet she wanna do it too now
Watching how I move
Tryna study all the tools
But you can't, you a lame
I can tell your pussy stank
Riding in that big body, when I hop out bet it dank
I'm on E lil' bitch, but I got a full tank
Fake on me lil' bitch, bet it make a bitch shake
First time I hit a mill I went and got some Gucci
Tell these bitches pull up and they playing hooky
If you ain't got bottles or bands bitch, don't book me
Run up on her, dark alley, in a black hoodie
B-b-b-bitch this the sugar trap turn your shit to puddin'
I'm always in the stu' bitch look at what I'm cookin'
I'm always this in some new shit so these hoes lookin'
And if you run up I bet you getting your shit tooken

[Chorus]
I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)
I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)

[Verse 2]
Hey, every day is lovely, every day is sunny
I don't need your money, bitch, I got my own money
Should have seen the shit comin'
Seen that bitch start punchin'
Red Audi fruit punchin'
If we fight you know my niggas gonna jump in
I ain't scared, bitch
Just a whole lotta gang shit
I'm a bear, you a mother fucking reindeer
Where I stay, you can't mother fucking stay there
Yuh, and I had to make that shit clear bitch

[Bridge]
I said I'm in a red Audi, bitches fruit punchin'
On a beat I don't punch in

[Chorus]
I'm a poppin' ass bitch let me remind ya (Remind ya)
Don't hide, I can always come and find ya (Find ya)
Ain't no bitch in me bitch, come proper (Bitch, come proper)
In an Audi going fast, you behind us (You behind us)
