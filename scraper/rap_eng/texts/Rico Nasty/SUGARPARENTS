[Chorus: Aminé]
I could be a sugar daddy, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot
I could be a sugar daddy, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Shawty want a first class flight on a jet
I put her on Spirit if she can, South West
Look baby I ain't one of these oldheads
If you give me Blac Chyna I'ma leave you on read
My money is my money so I put it in my sock
Here's some advice bitch, go get a job
Shawty can't stand me, even with ten toe
That's why she got a Cash App and a Venmo
I'm Mike, Bad, Thriller, nigga
Dirty Diana's always in my dresser
La-di-da-di-da-da-da-da-da-da
I'm the hubby bebopa undercover
I got racks on racks on racks
And you know that's facts on facts on facts
Gold diggers want an all access pass
So she give me all access to that ass

[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
I could be a sugar momma, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot
I could be a sugar momma, but I'd rather not
That's how I keep my money, baby, I got me a lot (A lot!)

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Sex sells, spend it on my retail
You gotta pay attention to the details
Always money when I check my email
Hotel by the seashore, got plenty seashells
I ain't got time for the he say she say
I just bought my own car and I ain't lease it
I can spend it on you but I ain't easy
He want me to buy him shoes, he ain't worth shoestrings
When I get into the show let me pull a few strings
Put the boy on game, he could learn a few things
Every old nigga talk the same old game
Selfish with my money and that shit won't change
You would think he went to school with the head game
I'ma let him break the rules if the head straight
But I'm good, I don't really need the deadweight (Naw)
I don't really need the deadweight, for real

[Chorus: Aminé & Rico Nasty]
We could be your sugar parents, but we'd rather not
We got a lot of money, baby, I know you wanna rock
We could be your sugar parents, but we'd rather not
We got a lot of money, baby, I know you wanna rock
