[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
I got a choppa in the trunk
Can't wait till my engine in the trunk
Bad bitch shake her ass in the club
These hoes is goofy they only showing fake love
Hold my money like a hug
Walking funny cause my slug
These bitches still be wearing uggs
Make me sick like, ugh baby girl get the fuck
Cashing out sippin' mud
Had to get it out the mud
See me then these bitches mug, YEAH

[Verse 2: Willtharapper]
Told that bitch don't do no hugs, look
That bitch say she in love, look
I smash on your bitch like I'm Mario
I get a lot of dough
I smoke her, they like it's honor roll
I see a opp then I shoot till the choppa broke
Or drum in that 40
That shit sound like rock & roll

[Verse 3: ChellyTheMC]
Aye, bad bitch shake her ass in the club

Bitches want relations that shit complicated
All these perky's really got a nigga elevated
Good brain got a nigga feeling educated
