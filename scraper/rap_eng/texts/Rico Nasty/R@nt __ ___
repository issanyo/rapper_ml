[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Cool and I'm pretty
I'm so undercover
Got Whitney no Bobby
My molly is pink
But fuck what you think
Wearing a mink
Just to go to the motherfucking store
Whore some motherfucking more
Raunchy bitches at my door
Screaming fake it till you make it
Bitch you fucking, I can't take it
Stop pretending, stop relating to my shit
You ain't never hit no lick
You ain't never smoke a nina
You can't sit with us type shit
You a basic wanna be, yeah
And I ain't throwing shades though
I'm COOL like my wrist
Yeah I know, pockets on Adele, can't shoot slow
Bitch I'm eating
I don't gotta introduce myself
They be like "it's nice to meet you"
Like "you look so cute in person, like can I get a feature?"
And then I'm like no way
Then she's like OMG
Then I'm like okay
Then she's like selfie
Then I'm like bitch I'm not fronting
Do I fucking know you? Do I fucking know you?

[Outro]
I'm the shadiest bitch, yeah I'm the craziest bitch
Got this shit on my hip so please do not play with me bitch
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the craziest bitch
That you'll ever fucking meet
Leave your body in the street
Please don't ever fuck with me
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the craziest bitch
Why you hate on me bitch?
You know I got money it's blatantly here
Please do not play with me bitch
Please do not play with me bitch
I'm the shadiest bitch, I'm the shadiest bitch
You mad you cannot fuck with my clique
