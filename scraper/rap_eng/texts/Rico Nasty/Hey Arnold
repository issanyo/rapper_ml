[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I taste just like ice cream
Bitch I am so icy
Heart cold like an ice queen
That's why they don't like me
Lackin', that's unlikely
I'm ridin' with pipes and
Smokin' on some good gas
Girl just come and try this
Catch me in the club bitch
See me poppin' bottles
He saw me on IG, thought I was a model
Your girlfriend, she swallow
I'm loadin' these hollows
She like takin' footballs
Call that bitch Hey Arnold

[Verse 2]
And I'm with a white bitch
She just like to try shit
Old nigga keep callin' me
I keep on declinin'
Bank account keep risin'
Enemies keep hidin'
These niggas be lyin'
You chose the wrong side bitch
Anything I show you
I want you to see it
Order up 10 bottles
Bitch we bout to get lit
Your bitch she might get hit
Hit her with a dirty stick
My niggas hold 30 clips

[Hook]
Shoot you like a movie bitch, yah
And I ain't with the goofy shit, yah

I pray to God that I can make them hits, yah
We smoke him like a hookah stick, yah
While you be on that goofy shit, yah
And no I am not new to this, yah
My watch, it got the fluorescent

[Verse 3]
Every time you see me I swear I'ma cash out
I like havin' bad bitches turnt up with they ass out
My new bitch like Hey Arnold, she fuck with them footballs
I think we gon' buy a whip just to take the roof off
I don't even know the bitch but I bet she with the shits
Soon as we walk in this bitch I can hear 'em talkin' shit
But that does not matter
Pockets getting fatter
I can get you madder
Money tall as ladders

[Outro]
I taste just like ice cream
