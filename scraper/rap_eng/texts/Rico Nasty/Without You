[Intro: Rico Nasty]
Uh-uh, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah

[Hook: Rico Nasty]
He said he get hard when he think about me
I swear every time we fuck I be screaming and shouting
Everywhere I go I can't be there without him
Baby's so loyal I can't even doubt him
Dick so bomb, I can't stop thinking about him
He's my sidekick, he said fuck a side bitch
If a bitch try to push up, punch that bitch for trying
Who am I without you right beside me?
Yeah, right beside me
Want you right beside me

[Verse 1: Tino Loud]
I told her give me 10 feet cause my baby crazy
She know my dick be bomb, she ride like new Mercedes
Do I love her, had to feel her out like applications
Baby simple, it just took some good head and patience
They know what they seeing, they shooting me
Every time we step out, it's just you and me
Bae you be snapping on bitches like poetry
Tripping, I'm tryna stick my dick in your ovaries
Bet I'm Jhene while I eat it like groceries
I signed my name on that ass like it's notary
You know that I'm street so I gotta keep a pole with me
Nothing like an ex when I got no ho in me

[Bridge: Tino Loud]
She said that she can't stop thinking about me
I done showed her real now it's life without me
So loyal and I'm riding and can't shit reroute me
Strike that pussy 3 times she still ain't out me
I love when she screams at the top of her lungs
She my lil soldier, she never run
Caliber rounds go another one
She not my main, she my only one
I love when she screams at the top of her lungs

[Verse 2: Tino Loud]
She on my hip and that's right beside me
Swing with them (?) like I'm Michael Lowry
No (?) she filled tryna satisfy me
Want it, I get it, she don't deny me
She on my hip and that's right beside me
Mama hates gangsters, she never hide me
We split the money, we don't divide it
So real, I'm the one she confide in

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
Yeah Rico, Rico
Yeah, yeah
Who am I? Baby is you gonna ride
Do or die, got my head all in the sky
Oh my, baby boy you do it right all night
All my ex-niggas try
But them niggas can't compete
Got me leaking on the sheets
Daddy know that I'm a freak
I'ma be whatever he want me to be
I love you but I just need you to see
Don't take advantage of me because I'll hurt a bitch
I'll fucking mark a bitch
He tell me calm down with that crazy shit
Just give me dick, yeah-yeah
Baby you the one, who am I?
Baby you the one, who am I?
