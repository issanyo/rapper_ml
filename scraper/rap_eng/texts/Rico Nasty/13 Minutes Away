[Hook: 2HypeMike]
I'm 13 minutes away, I'm 13 minutes away
Girl just chill out and wait, I'm 13 minutes away
Lil shawty had patience, you got me out here speed racing
I'm 13 minutes away 'cause I know you tired of waiting
I'm 13 minutes away, I'm 13 minutes away
Girl just chill out and wait, I'm 13 minutes away
Lil shawty had patience, you got me out here speed racing
I'm 13 minutes away 'cause I know you tired of waiting

[Verse 1: 2HypeMike]
I know you tired of waiting (I know you tired of)
I'm on my way, I'm not playing (I'm on my way)
This shit getting old, it's ancient (it's ancient)
We need better communication
I just gotta do what I gotta do (do what I gotta do)
Baby girl I will not lie to you (baby girl I will not)
We won't get married, no rendezvous (no, no)
You don't wanna chill with me that is cool (that is cool)
But I just know you are missin' out (missin' out)
You can't find me 'cause I'm missin' out (missin' out)
I'm on whole different mission now (I'm on a whole different)
I'm tryna knock on your sisters now (tryna knock on your sisters)
A smile on my face, this is not a front
She mad that I'm balling, she out of bounds (she out of bounds)
I thought she'd be happy I kept it real (kept it real)
And I didn't give her the run around (run around)
But I guess I shouldn't've done it
Tried to give you everything that you wanted
And won't be fake so I kept it a hundred
And to think I end up getting punished
Need everything back like I fronted
This shit getting old, it's ancient (it's ancient)
Just relax, you ain't shit (you ain't shit)
Fuck all our communication (fuck all our communi-)
You got me sick like a patient

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
He said that he 13 minutes away
And I know that I don't wanna wait
He said that it's wet like a lake (yeah)
He put in work, baby boy need a raise
I ain't with the fakin', don't play games
Like 'em lowkey and he stay out the way
Fuck me good and put me in my place
Give me space, never all in my face
But lately we haven't been on the same page (oh)
The more we get distant the more that I miss when he say
He 13 minutes away
I need him to eat me like a plate
And I know that this isn't a phase
Baby boy different, he can't be replaced, yeah
Goofy niggas in the way
