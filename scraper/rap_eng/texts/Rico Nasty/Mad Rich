[Intro]
WhoisMike going crazy
Woah! Huh! Yeah!

[Hook]
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich

[Verse]
Bitch I’m twenty but I’m thinking like I’m forty
My niggas play with babies not the ones that get aborted
She crushed the molly down, she said, "it’s better if you snort it"
I keep the cash in the house, now I’m looking like a hoarder
Don’t ask me for no song 'cause nigga I seen a sneak diss
Pissing motherfuckers off, hoe you on a piss list
Yeah I got a lot of weight but I ain’t fit bitch
Don’t you ever cross that line, do you need a fit bit?
I ain’t drinking lean cause I usually sip liq
Pussy legit, niggas wanna lick this
Got a gun full of hollow tips, fuck a ballistic
Just spent a hundred dollars on some fucking lipstick
Woah! Huh! Yuh! Yeah-yeah!

[Refrain]
Walking with a limp, gas in my hemp
Pull up to the club, with the windows tint
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Walking with a limp, gas in the hemp
Pull up to the club, with the windows tint
Hop up out the car looking mad rich
Walking with a limp, gas in the hemp
Pull up to the club, with the windows tint

[Hook]
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich

[Bridge]
Make ten bands, twenty, watch this magic trick
Scope on the rifle so I don’t miss
All these bitches my kids, stop trying
Stop trying, stop trying
Make ten bands, twenty, watch this magic trick
Scope on the rifle so I don’t miss
All these bitches my kids, stop trying
Stop trying, stop trying

[Hook]
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich

[Outro]
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
Hop up out the car, looking mad rich
Looking mad rich, looking mad rich
