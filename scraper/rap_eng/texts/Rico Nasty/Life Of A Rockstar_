[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
They playing poker, they bluffing
I fucks on that bitch, it ain't nothing
Don't care bout the seeds or no cuffing
I'm only cuffing that money
She'll do it all for a hundred
She hop on that dick like a bunny
I walk up on 'em, now we running
All my music should be bumping
But she hating cause she ugly
That clip hold 50, he keep dumping
Bitch I turn nothing to something
My pockets look just like a pumpkin
I put the money in a duffle
I don't know you I can't
