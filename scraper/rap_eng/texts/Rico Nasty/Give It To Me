Give me all your love and your trust
Lay me down and do whatever you want
Yeah baby give it to me
I always got what you need, I can be your fantasy
You said you like it nasty, well I guess that's how you got to me
I think that we was meant to be
I seen you in my wildest dreams
Thoughts of you and me
Hennessy and weed
I can be your everything baby
I know you been feeling so fucking alone baby
Just give me all of you
Give me all your love and your trust
Lay me down and do whatever you want

You said you like it nasty, well I guess that's how you got to me

[Verse: Tino Loud]
She gon' pop it for a real nigga
She ain't never gave that pussy to a lame though
I won't play with your heart girl
But I play with that pussy like a game though
And I need you in my picture like a frame though
Know you had a couple real niggas
Still we ain't the same though
When I tell you not to do it and you don't
When you tell me not to do it, swear I won't
We so different but we perfect
You ain't never had a nigga made you nervous
You said I make you feel just like a virgin
I'ma slide those panties open like a curtain
I go to work, it ain't no call off
And fuck them other bitches, cut them all off
Now we reaching for the sky just like a jumper
Be hoping that everything you love me on the (?) like woah
