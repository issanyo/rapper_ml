Lil Sperry:

Really, really high in heaven like Marley
Fuck with Rico on TV like Carly (Lil Sperry)

Take no prisoners no we don't save
Beats in my ears, J's on my feet
We never go to sleep cause vamp niggas sneak
And you know my ass was up in the kitchen
And you know my ass really gonna eat

Hydro Dre:

New wave, I swag when I surf
Vlone trapping, yeah I swag when I serve
Counting bands, I feel like a clerk
She give me brain now I feel like a nerd

Splash on your bitch with the water
Swerve on the feds at the corner (Hydro Dre)
Ya ya

Eazy Mack:

She's my old bitch, Ray J and Kim K
