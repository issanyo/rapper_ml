[Intro]
Don't compare me to these bitches because we are not the same
Woah
Try to steal my sauce but you can't
Yeah
Kenny, oh my fucking, Rico

[Verse 1]
G-G-Goodness gracious, I might give a fuck on a rare occasion
I would steal my sauce too, ‘cause it’s outrageous
Do whatchu gonna do, you don’t gotta explain it
I just booted up so I’m concentrated
How much money can I make on vacation?
Walk up in the party, I know they eyebrows raisin’
Two bands on my shoes, they ain't even got laces

[Chorus]
I-I-I like bad bitches who be ragin’
Rage, ragin’, ragin’, rage
Bad bitches who be ragin’
Rage, ragin’, ragin’, rage

[Verse 2]
Eeny meeny miny mo, catch a rat by her tail
Don't ask what I'm smokin' on 'cause that shit ain't for sale
I can't trip off a basic bitch, 'cause I might break ya nail
You a fuckin' donkey, I'ma let this choppa pin yo tail
I'm stuck in traffic, music blastin'
They wanna know how it happened
Salute me like I'm they captain
You bitches is not a challenge
I'm causing shit for a reaction, want action, I'm snappin'
Stop with the racket, Balenciaga my fashion
My bitches ragin' and blackin' out
Keep my name out your fucking mouth
Before you find out what we about
Type of shit that you read about
If you talk it then be about it
Call 9-1-1, this bitch bleedin' out
But we still got the speakers loud
Give a fuck if you reachin' out

[Chorus]
I like bad bitches who be ragin’
Rage, ragin’, ragin’, rage
Bad bitches who be ragin’
Rage, ragin’, ragin’, rage

[Outro]
What the fucking, fucking, fucking
Rage, (go) rage, (go, go) rage
Rage, (go) rage, (go, go) rage  (go, go)
Rage, rage, rage, rage
Gooo!
