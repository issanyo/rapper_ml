[Intro]
Yeah, you know I don’t never know what to say right here
[?] took it to town

[Chorus]
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I getcho nigga HARD
This blunt is hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I got yo nigga HARD
This blunt I’m hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD

[Verse 1]
Smoke bamboo, big lit
Thick white bitch, Iggy
You know my weed sticky
What’s the secret Vicky?
We be turnt like Timmy
Then we roll out like Jimmy
My show sold out in your city
You can’t keep up wit me
Sit on his face ‘til his nose guard
To put me down you need both arms
These bitches mad cause I go hard
Ready, set, I got on Goyard
Chains on my belt, I’m a rockstar
Don’t need ID, I use facecard
These niggas dig me like a graveyard
I work hard so I get to play hard

[Chorus]
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I getcho nigga HARD
This blunt is hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I got yo nigga HARD
This blunt I’m hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD

[Verse 2]
What I got on it ain’t come from the store
They see me soon as I walk through the door
I’m up on the roof, I was just on the floor
How the fuck did I get rich when I was just poor?
All of these blessings, I’m thankin’ the lord
I’m never stoppin’ I gotta keep goin’
I don’t use the brakes when I’m drivin’ a foreign
I only go faster, I never go slower
Ballin’ so hard like, “what’s the score?”
If she want beef, I need a fork
I know it hurt them to the core
Your nigga a lame, a bitch, a dork
Bitch I come from nothin’, every day I’m stuntin’
I know you ain’t got this, bought it out the country
Money don’t mean nothin’, get it like it’s double
If we get into it, you know you in trouble

[Chorus]
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I getcho nigga HARD
This blunt is hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD
Bitch, I be goin’ HARD
I got yo nigga HARD
This blunt I’m hittin’ HARD
And what I’m whippin’, HARD
