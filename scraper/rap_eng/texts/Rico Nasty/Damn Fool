[Intro: Highlife Cato]
Damn, I just walked out Neiman Marcus with a shopping card
Can't afford it, you just leave it in the shopping cart
I'm tryna put spikes on my feet so it ain't hurt to kick it
Same bitch used to lean on me tryna kick it

[Hook: Highlife Cato]
You a damn fool, you a damn fool
Better play it cool, Broadstreet got the tool
Better stay in school or end up on the news
That nigga think he cool but he don't got the juice
You a damn fool, you a damn fool
Better play it cool, Broadstreet got the tool
Better stay in school or end up on the news
That nigga think he cool but he don't got the juice

[Verse 1: Highlife Cato]
You'se a damn fool it's something in my juice
It's something in my juice that got me saying fuck in twos
That gas on me in booth, I gotta watch my moves
A nigga play with game and leave him, he into it too
Damn, I just walked out Neiman Marcus with a shopping card
Can't afford it, you just leave it in the shopping cart
I'm tryna put spikes on my feet so it ain't hurt to kick it
Same bitch used to lean on me tryna kick it
She say what's the lawyer fee, them bitches look expensive
Fly (?) and a Roll' got everyone offended
She wanna fuck me cause she heard that the dick tremendous
I fucked that bitch and kicked her out just like I'm the (?)
I been flipping since I learned to turn a one a to two
I'm tryna turn my fucking Beamer to a Bentley coupe
I'm tryna cap, mask down, catch (?) snooze
In high school we was at your parties with that boom
She don't want no bitch nigga cause the bitch ain't gay
Whip clean, riding dirty on the interstate
You buying (?) I'm just tryna buy some real estate
No OG man, (?) and you get killed today

[Hook: Highlife Cato]
You a damn fool, you a damn fool
Better play it cool, Broadstreet got the tool
Better stay in school or end up on the news
That nigga think he cool but he don't got the juice
You a damn fool, you a damn fool
Better play it cool, Broadstreet got the tool
Better stay in school or end up on the news
That nigga think he cool but he don't got the juice

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
Money is the mission
Shoot you like Scottie Pippen
I think your shoes untied because lil bitch you really tripping
That lean is what I'm sipping
I don't think that you listening
Them hoes still hating on me, oh God you must be kidding, ya
My bitches trap out the ounce
Baby girl keep my name out your mouth
Drugs coming in straight from the south
While I'm getting money you sit on the couch
Black and white bitches just like a Zebra
You're (?) nigga a tinker
I'm in the throw while you sit on the bleachers
Twitter bitches sucking just like some (?)
Raf Simmons, no I don't want Adidas
Shooters shooting just like Trevor Ariza
Pockets sloppy, that's just sauce on the pizza
Selling drugs like that shit ain't illegal
Hit you twice like a motherfucking sequel
Baby girl, me and you are not illegal
Wrist cold like a motherfucking freezer
Bullets hot like a motherfucking fever
