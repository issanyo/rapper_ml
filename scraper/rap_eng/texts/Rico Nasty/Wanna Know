[Intro]
I just wanna know
I just wanna know
Rico, Rico

[Verse 1]
How you askin' for favors when you were never there?
Had your comments and doubts about my entire career
Told me I couldn't and wouldn't and now I'm finally here
I hope you hearin' me, I'm really tryna make it clear
I saw people comin' up and it just wasn't fair
'Cause I worked just as hard as them and I should be there
I had people talkin' shit but I just never cared
I used to be so regular and now I'm everywhere
'Fore everything happened to me I knew my time was near
And I could tell it by the way people were acting weird
And I ain't got no competition off of what I hear
And I ain't need no help, I did it on my own
Baby I just wanna know

[Chorus]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, oh yeah, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know

[Verse 2]
I'm at a place in life they said I'll never go
I know people that they said I'll never know
I'm a hundred 'cause a side I never chose
And I'm loyal 'cause I never broke the code
Stop talkin' bout doin' shit, I know you won't
You know that I be rockin' out at all my shows
Now I'm buyin' all types of designer clothes
Straight A's, you could say I'm on a roll
I been busy all week, I'm on the road
She hatin', but my shows she front row
It didn't happen, and don't anybody know
You can't keep up with me, girl you're too slow

[Chorus]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, oh yeah, baby, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
I just wanna know, yeah, I just wanna know
