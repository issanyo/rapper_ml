[Chorus: lil aaron]
I know you think that you fly the way you came in
But I could go and change your life if you my main bitch
'Cause oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous

[Verse 1: lil aaron]
Yeah drinks are free, drugs are free
Girl just come with me I run the scene, yeah
Anything you wanna see, baby I could keep you company
Been up for days, up for weeks
Out here gettin' paid, just fuck with me
Shawty I ain't got no time for games
Tell me do you wanna run away?

[Chorus: lil aaron & Rico Nasty]
'Cause I know you think that you fly the way you came in
But I could go and change your life if you my main bitch
'Cause oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous (Rico, Rico)
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
I'm rockstar famous bitch know you ain't us
Walk up in the party we were more than we came with
I already know that's why more bitches hate us
Anywhere, anytime they know a bitch turn the stage up
Go get me my money then I'm heading to the next one
Bitches always concerned 'bout the next one
Fuck around and get hit with the left one
If this a competition than you lookin' at the best one

[Hook: lil aaron]
I know you think that you fly the way you came in
But I could go and change your life if you my main bitch
'Cause oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous

[Bridge: lil aaron]
I could change your life overnight
Girl just close your eyes
There ain't nothing else, but flashing lights
On this side, yeah
I could change your life overnight
Girl just close your eyes
There ain't nothing else, but flashing lights

[Chorus: lil aaron]
I know you think that you fly the way you came in
But I could go and change your life if you my main bitch
'Cause oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
I know you think that you fly the way you came in
But I could go and change your life if you my main bitch
'Cause oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
Oh, oh, oh, oh I'm rockstar famous
