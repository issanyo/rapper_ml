[Chorus]
Bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm nasty
Bitch  I'm nasty, bitch I'm - bitch I'm nasty
Agh, bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm nasty  (Kenny! Rico!)
Bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm - bitch I'm nasty

[Verse]
Bitch talkin' shit but she living in a kid room
Bitches wanna hate, swoop 'em up with a big broom
I've been makin' big moves, yeah
You've been fuckin' mad dudes, why you fuckin' mad dude?
Is it 'cause I'm makin' money like your dad do?
While you suckin' random niggas like a vacuum
I don't know why she went into the bathroom (I do!)
But I know what this motherfuckin' cash do
Sweet like a Pop-Tart, don't take it to heart
Play it cute, thatâ€™s smart, I don't need your chart
I don't need your part, I just need to smoke
I just, (Bitch fuck you! Shut up!) Rico, calm down
Bitch I'm charged up!
Bitches wanna beef, get you burnt up, I am the best, bar none
And I'm screamin', "Fuck Trump! Black girls, stand up!"
Bitch I'm nasty, and I don't give a fuck like, what is classy?
Smokin' on cat pee and my voice is raspy
I know these hoes can't stand me
I'm a black queen in a black coupe
With some black niggas in some black suits
If you run up on us, then they gon' shoot
I don't really care what you kids do
Gang! I don't really care what you bitches do!
Woah! I'm that bitch, shawty, who are you?

[Chorus]
Bitch I'm nasty, (Duh!) bitch I'm nasty
Bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm - bitch I'm nasty
Agh, bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm nasty
Bitch I'm nasty, bitch I'm - bitch I'm nasty
