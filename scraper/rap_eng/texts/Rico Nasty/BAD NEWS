[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
She don't pop Percs but she pops the pussy (Okay)
He might flash the bang, if the opps are looking (Alright)
I'ma throw some ones when the ass is falling (Okay)
I might hit the lick if the cash is calling

[Chorus: IDK]
I take your stacks, now I got racks
I take your stacks, now I got racks
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)

[Verse 1: IDK]
Only blue hundreds on my mind these days (Okay)
See us in the DM, and she mine these days (Alright)
Work ethic like I be on the line these days (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
These niggas can't see me
And there is no wonder why I shine these days (Stevie)
So back the fuck up, I got batches of luck
I'ma dig you a diss so your ass gon' be stuck
I don't know who to trust, everybody is sus
Everybody's a faker, a liar, a bluff
Everybody's transforming, I'm Shia LeBouf
Don't nobody be straight with it, eyein' 'em up
Ain't no need to debate with it, I am the one
I'ma count up this bread while you eyein' the crumbs, yikes

[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
She don't pop Percs but she pops the pussy (Okay)
He might flash the bang, if the opps are looking (Alright)
I'ma throw some ones when the ass is falling (Okay)
I might hit the lick if the cash is calling

[Verse 2: Rico Nasty]
I don't got no competition, I don't got no rights
But I got a damn rifle, quick-scope, red dot 'em
Put a bitch to sleep, hell yeah, a bed rocker
I got hits like Red Sox, I got bitches, lip lockin'
Beef with me, it's no stoppin'
That bag comin', no stoppin'
That meant that they can't stop it
Bitch you need to stop talkin'
'Cause you know you ain't poppin'
And my style, you can't rock it
Confident, I ain't cocky
And I just went shoppin'

[Pre-Chorus: IDK]
She don't pop Percs but she pops the pussy (Okay)
He might flash the bang, if the opps are looking (Alright)
I'ma throw some ones when the ass is falling (Okay)
I might hit the lick if the cash is calling

[Chorus: IDK & Rico Nasty]
I take your stacks, now I got racks
I take your stacks, now I got racks
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks (Ayy)
I take your stacks, now I got racks, right
