[Intro]
Rico, Rico, yeah
Whoah, yeah

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid

[Verse 1]
You think that I'm in the ocean, the way that I ride the beat
Eat all of these bitches up for breakfast like bon appetit
Everyone who doubted me, I got 'em all in disbelief
Rather do it than to say it because I know talk is cheap
Rap is like a Transformer, remind me of Bumble Bee
They say I apply the pressure, I know they can feel the heat
I keep elevating every day, don't think I have a peak
I know they gon' act hard, but I know these bitches weak
My diamonds different colors, man they look just like the rainbow
I change hairstyles more than these lil' bitches change clothes
I got a lot of expensive fabric all on my wardrobe
Pull up to a bitch show, now the show postponed

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid

[Verse 2]
These niggas act thirteen, these bitches act like me
When I step out I make a movie, no Spike Lee
This gas I'm smokin' on em make the whole damn house reek
Brought my first car, cash ho, 'cause I ain't need a damn lease
If money was honey, a bee a only I wanna be
They run up with my sauce but they still can't do it quite like me
I know you want my spot but that's somewhere that you'll never be
I'm too busy hangin' with the wolves to be countin' sheep

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid

[Outro]
I do what I wanna do, I say what I wanna say
I get new hate every day, I hope I don't catch a case
Rollin' all this ganja, it's gon' take me to a better place
Rather do it than to say, while you hate, I'm gettin' paid
