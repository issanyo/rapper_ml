[Intro]

Sugar all over the trap, yeah
Sugar Trap

[Verse]
Two bitches on me, oh yeah I'm in a sequel
That bitch an actor, she belong in Regal
When I get up, call me a Desert Eagle
No underwear but I got on a see through
She gon' get nasty, she show you what money do
Swear that I don't know none of these people
Two foreign bitches, I think they illegal
Got some shooters who gon' hit when they see you
We go to New York and splurge
Just like the ones in The Purge
You say you chop on the curb
I think you just saying words
You mad you couldn't get served
You on my page, why you lurk?
Block a bitch like I'm Serg
Pop a bitch like a perc
Labels all on my shirt
Keep it under my skirt
Bitch you can't come up we said
All you can do is talk shit
Designer on me, I'm a walking lick
Boy you was hot like a bit
Turn the club up, we get lit
Liquor getting to me, I think I'm hit
Get paid for a show then I buy a new whip
Smoke a bitch like a cig
These hoes smoking mint
Girl you is not with the shits
My hoe left i grew up in the apartments
Sister had a problem then I would solve it
Most of these witches be hot like some coffee
I don't play basketball, you cannot cross me
I can't even shoot the bitch if I wanted to
They gon' play victim, act like they don't know the truth
Please don't walk up on me if I don't know you
Please don't me let you feel what this pole do
I done had so many problems with people
That bitch an actor, she belong in Regal
Bitch you a ran up lil ho, you a weasel
Bitches be thought they playing with needles
Bitches back to back, yeah I'm in the sequel
My mouth a weapon, I swear it's so lethal
You sucking dick and you mad he won't keep you
No food on your plate but girl I can't feed you

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Sugar all over the Trap, Sugar all over the Trap
Either way it's on the map, it's on the map
Find your way, X on the map
Sugar all over the charts, Sugar all over the charts
Haha, Sugar Trap
