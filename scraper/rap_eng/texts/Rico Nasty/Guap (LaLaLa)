[Intro]
Children, cover up your ears and do the lala sound!
(cheers) Woah, BITCH!
Haha, Rico
What's up Kenny?
Lalala, what the fuck?
KEEEEENNNNNYYYYYYYYY

[Chorus]
Be-bet you, bet you, bet you wishing on a star
You praying that this shit would stop
See you actin' like you hard but that is somethin' that you not
I got big knots so my pockets they be swole a lot
Like la la la la la la, I'm singing to the fuckin' guap
Be-bet you, bet you, bet you wishing on a star
You praying that this shit would stop
See you actin' like you hard but that is somethin' that you not
(Uh, uh, uh, you lil hoe!)
I got big knots so my pockets they be swole a lot
Like la la la la la la la, I'm singing to the fuckin' guap

[Verse]
Big body Benz, pullin' up with some black rims
I only sign checks, multiply, no subtractin'
Runnin' circles 'round these bitches, think I'm on a track field
Fast car, hot wheels, fuck how a hater feel
Bitch I signed a major deal. multi million dollar conversations
You can't get a chair, four bundles in my head
Two bands on my feet
If you got a issue, you can get it like a magazine
I ain't goin' back and forth, you gotta pay to talk to me
When you hit my blunt, it feel like you stepped in a boxing ring
Atcho door like Halloween, and all my niggas trick or treat
Yes my name is Rico Nasty, I know that it's nice to meet me

[Chorus]
Be-bet you, bet you, bet you wishing on a star
You praying that this shit would stop
See you actin' like you hard but that is somethin' that you not
I got big knots so my pockets they be swole a lot
Like la la la la la la, I'm singing to the fuckin' guap
Be-bet you, bet you, bet you wishing on a star
You praying that this shit would stop
See you actin' like you hard but that is somethin' that you not
(Uh, uh, uh, you lil hoe!)
I got big knots so my pockets they be swole a lot
Like la la la la la la la, I'm singing to the fuckin' guap
