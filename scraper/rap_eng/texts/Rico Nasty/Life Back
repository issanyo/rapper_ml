[Intro]
Gin$eng
Rico! Yeah!

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They said they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They say they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back

[Verse 1]
It took a long time to get here, so I won't look back
You spoke too soon, well, that's too bad
Steppin' on my toes, you can get a toe tag
I know I'm the shit, I don't really like to brag
I'm in a good mood, I'm havin' a great day
They don't have nothin' else to do but throw shade
I just went and spent a few racks up in Dolce
You already know it's my way or no way

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They said they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They said they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back

[Verse 2]
Is it 'cause my money quicker? My bundles thicker
I got a couple figures, blow the whistle
I am so official, I keep a pistol
I don't need your permission, I don't need your opinion
Can't you see I'm on a mission, I gotta go and get it
Listen to my intuition, chasin' every single digit
Takin' every chance you missin', they keep talkin' I don't listen
Don't wear it unless it glisten, I know they can see the difference

[Chorus]
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They said they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
Everybody wanna act like they know me
They said they want the old me
Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back
