[Intro]
Lex Luger on the beat so, what the fuck you think?
Rico!

[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot - scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot - scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous

[Verse 1: Rico Nasty]
Up late, no sleep - that's no breaks
Smoke gray good gas - that's propane
Ski mask, no face - that's no name
No diamonds in this watch, bitch, it's plain jane
I'm in love with nothin' but Mary Jane
You need to watch your damn mouth, stay in yo lane
Pimpin' hoes like I'm walkin' wit a fuckin' cane
Stupid whip ride through wit no brain
How many bad bitches fit in a Range?
"Can I drive your car Rico?" Bitch what you think?
I got a bad attitude, I can't change
Pull up, bet it dank, where I'm from, it ain't safe

[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot - scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot - scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous

[Verse 2: Lil Gnar]
Bad bitches flockin' me, all these hoes jockin' me
Only speak in money, lil bitch, that's that guapanese
So high - outer space, I'm on some other shit
Ice dancin', lookin like I'm tryna call the mothership
Party girl off the molly, welcome to my world
Fuck a stage - in the crowd, I need a moshpit
Rage out - Lil Gnar brought them thangs out
Ten shots from this fire, take yo head off

[Chorus: Rico Nasty]
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot - scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous
Off of transformer, you a informer
I'ma deform ya, let them thangs torch ya
She hot scorchin', you cannot afford this
Bad bitch wit me and she look so gorgeous
