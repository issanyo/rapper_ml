[Intro]
Hi Kevin

[Chorus]
What's the point? Lala da da da
What you mean? Lala da da da
Are those words? Lala da da da
In one ear and out the other one

[Verse 1]
Moving slow, eyes low, cup full, blunt rolled
I don't even know where I land
You know I get money so when they see me flexin'
They can't do nothin' but act like a fan
I don't do word of mouth, watch what you say
Or I make sure that you can't say it again
New city, new show, baby take it slow
You might never see me again
Yeah

[Chorus]
What's the point? Lala da da da
What you mean? Lala da da da
Are those words? Lala da da da
In one ear and out the other one

[Verse 2]
I've seen angels cry, I've seen demons dance
Baby take a picture, make the moment last
Weed residue all over my designer pants
That's my old flow, you could have that
I don't look at the pricetag, I just ring it up
I got these bitches so mad, now they teamin' up
You gon' get what you lookin' for if you keep it up
People always got a problem but they never speakin' up

[Chorus]
What's the point? Lala da da da
What you mean? Lala da da da
Are those words? Lala da da da
In one ear and out the other one
