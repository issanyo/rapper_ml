[Intro]
Kenny! Rico!

[Verse 1]
My bitches act stupid so please don't test them
Walking with a weapon, they don't check me
I'm smoking on some veggies, yeah, I'm feelin' real healthy
Running game on 'em, bet they can't catch me
I feel like a alien like I was in a test tube
Pistol blow your candles out, I'll come and bless you
I'm thinkin' 'bout a vacay, somewhere in the Canc√∫ns
Flyer than a airplane, think I need a parachute
Talkin' like you big shit, I ain't never heard of you
Better than you on my worst day
Designer on my sweatsuit
It look like a spacesuit, ridin' in a space coupe
You look like a cartoon, I wouldn't even watch you

[Chorus]
In my own lane, do my own thing
Wanna be great, what's it gon' take?
People false claim, people gon' hate
But you can't worry 'bout them
'Cause they won't change
In my own lane, do my own thing
Wanna be great, what's it gon' take?
People false claim, people gon' hate
But you can't worry 'bout them
'Cause they won't change

[Verse 2]
I got real money, hoe I ain't frontin'
I don't need nothin', niggas wanna hump me
Bitches wanna crime me, I just fuckin' love me
Stuntin' on a bitch, and I just switched gears
If you talkin' shit, man I really don't care
I just bought that shit, so I know they gon' stare
I been winnin' so much, yeah, I know it ain't fair
Got more gas than a Shell, I just show and you tell
I think that I'm sick and it might be contagious
It don't matter what I do, they hate it then they take it
People fake it 'till they make it, always dressed up in the latest
You can never catch me slippin', 'cause I'm never fuckin' playin'

[Chorus]
In my own lane, do my own thing
Wanna be great, what's it gon' take?
People false claim, people gon' hate
But you can't worry 'bout them
'Cause they won't change
In my own lane, do my own thing
Wanna be great, what's it gon' take?
People false claim, people gon' hate
But you can't worry 'bout them
'Cause they won't change
