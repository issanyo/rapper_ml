[Intro]
Rico!
Kennyyyy!

[Verse 1]
High off acid! Fly like Aladdin
On the red carpet dressed in high fashion
Hello! How you doin'? Bitch I’m outstandin'
You couldn't get in, so you outside standin’
I could stand still but my diamonds still dancin'
He a hood nigga but I make him a romantic
I'mma go and get the money, like I am a addict
Before I went and got a safe, I put it in my attic

[Chorus]
I ain't classy, more like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl, like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy, hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me

[Verse 2]
All these rap niggas be like, "Damn! Where my song at?"
Catch me in the room, I’m smokin’ gas, where the fog at
Two-tone, mix-match, they like, "where you get that?"
You niggas some pussies, lemme show you where my dogs at
Fuckin' on yo bitch, tried to tell me where her walls at
He gave me his number, but he know I ain’t gon' call back
Fall back, if you got a problem we can solve that
We do this often, wake you up like coffee in the mornin'
Money and residuals, so when I sleep it's criminal
When I pull up in the coupe and drop the beat
Even though it was stutterin’
High off acid! Alice in Wonderland
I'mma always go get the ball when you bitches fumble it

[Chorus]
I ain't classy, more like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy, hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why these bitches can't stand me
I ain't classy, more like sassy
Smokin' out the bowl like the bitch named Sandy
Taste like candy, hands like Randy
I'm original, that's why you bitches can't stand me
