[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, hey

[Verse 1]
I ain't in Houston but I got a rocket on me
It's a lot of bitches, daily tryna clone me
I don't need a gang, I'll take you by my lonely
I'ma shoot shit up, this pistol ain't made by no Sony
Pull up in a red Audi, call me Rojo
You can't keep up with me bitch, you a slowpoke
Mo' money, mo' problems, I just smoke mo'
A lot of drugs, bigger miles for the low low
I got two bitches with me couldn't choose one
Do you work at 7/11? You slurpin'
I ain't a wave rider, bitch I'll buy the ocean
I'ma dive in, while these bitches floatin'
And my numbers keep goin' up while they coastin'
And if money was bread then I'm double loafin'
I got a beam and this clip, so I'm double focused
If I ain't got it on me, I'ma double poker

[Hook]
I'm in a four door, four O's (four O's, yeah)
Red car, Rojo (Rojo)
Jewelry always on Coldstone (on Coldstone)
Bad bitches always loco (always loco)
I'm in a four door, four O's (super soaker)
Red car, Rojo (loco motive)
Jewelry always on Coldstone (huh uh, huh uh oh)
Bad bitches always loco (limo)

[Verse 2]
Pussy stay wet, super soaker
I'm in a foreign, loco motive
My bitch is foreign, she's so loco
She don't like broke niggas, yo tampoco
Roll it up, then I blow it out the window
Niggas spray your block and make you do the limbo
Knock her ass out, like Kimbo
Then I pull up to the party in a limo

[Hook]
I'm in a four door, four O's (yeah)
Red car, Rojo (Rojo)
Jewelry always on Coldstone (on Coldstone)
Bad bitches always loco (always loco)
I'm in a four door, four O's (super soaker)
Red car, Rojo (loco motive)
Jewelry always on Coldstone (huh uh, huh uh oh)
Bad bitches always loco (limbo)
