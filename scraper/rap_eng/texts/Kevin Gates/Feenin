[Intro: Lyrica]
Won't you come over? Yeah
Won't you come over?
Won't you come over?
Won't you come over?

[Verse 1: Lyrica]
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Why are you acting like a fool?
It's the nasty things you do
That send me through the roof
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Why I’m sitting here needing you?
This shit here over due, Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica]
Tell me why you had to go this far? This far
Baby I will come to where you are

[Chorus: Lyrica]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
What you mean when you say you need who?
On the couch in your V secret in a see-through
Emotions rolling, saying me too
With your thoughts on my faucet I can see through
Say trust issues, I'm stereotypes
Had a nigga feeling I was never your type
Gripping your waist, throwing dick in your thighs
Bet you never had a real nigga look in your eyes
Now stand up, now dance for me, now do it real slow no hands for me
Say ew euf, I'm watching, tell your ex boyfriend stop blocking
I'm a gangsta that mean I got options
Call block on the phone talking bout info
I whip down, he whipped up, I whipped out the extento

[Chorus: Lyrica]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you

[Verse 3: Lyrica]
Baby I've been waiting
Yeah, baby I’ve been waiting on you
I fuck around and lock the door
Straight push you down and put it out on you
I'm just hoping you can take
I'm just hoping you can take it to
The next level, Hope you ready for what I'ma do, I'ma do

[Pre-Chorus: Lyrica]
Tell me why you had to go this far? This far
Baby I will come to where you are
Boys stop playing games

[Chorus: Lyrica]
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby I'm needing you

[Outro: Lyrica]
Won't you come over, won't you come over?
Won't you come over? Yeah
Won't you come over, won't you come over?
Won't you come over?
