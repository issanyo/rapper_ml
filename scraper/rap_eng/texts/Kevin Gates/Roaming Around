[Intro]
That bitch come on like a movie
I've been roaming around
Getting bored with designer clothes
Material things, never seem to hold you back
They just seem to hold you yeah

[Chorus]
I've been roaming around
I've been roaming, around
I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found
Say I've been roaming, around
I've been praying that the rain don't fall
Painful memories erase those all
Say I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found
I've been roaming around
I've been roaming, around
I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found
Say I've been roaming, around
I've been praying that the rain don't fall
Painful memories erase those all
Say I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found

[Verse 1]
See I just fucked up a sack
And got it back off the jump
Meaning I picked up the fumble
Not afraid to get money
Shawty with me shining brighter than the lights in the city
I'mma put her in a Beamer while my ex in a Sentra
I'm just doing shit on purpose for to make em look at us
She looks over and laughing
We like "baby you messy"
Talking reckless, disrespect, I'm not afraid to go rumble (wild out)
If he wanna do it with me we can get it with muscle
Nigga talking bout a tussle but that iron bout to flush 'em
Nigga take a concussion
I ain't a busta
I ain't afraid to go bust 'em
And I lay down like "fuck it"

[Verse 2]
Niggas knowing the business (Look Uptown, Beezy, Mocha what it do)
Everyone get it (They do)
If I walk up in a establishment, I'm not leaving a witness (Wanna keep ya head keep ya hands on top of em!)
I tie up all the loose ends
And I'm going hard, all day long
Avoiding questions asking me why I ain't came home
Street lights on but I still ain't came home
I hustle all day long (turnup, turnup, turnup, turnup!)

[Outro]
I've been r
I've been r
I've been roaming, around

[Chorus]
I've been roaming around
I've been roaming, around
I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found
Say I've been roaming, around
I've been praying that the rain don't fall
Painful memories erase those all
Say I've been roaming around
Somewhere up in the clouds
Somebody flyer than I
They're nowhere to be found
