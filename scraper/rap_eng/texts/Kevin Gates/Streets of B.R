[Chorus]
The game on freeze
But I be trapping in and out it
You gotta believe
That there ain’t no other way
Around it
I can’t sleep
But pray to God
That he find me
The shit won’t cease
They say they found another body
In the streets of BR
It’s the hardest way of living
The good die young
And the others go to prison
In the streets of BR
Listen close and pay attention
The Church ain’t safe
So I ain’t looking for religion
In the streets of BR

[Verse 1]
Gripping this Mac 10
Work for my workers
Helicopter circling prostitutes I be servin' em
Prosecuting Attorney want me dead
It ain’t like I ever did em shit
But kept my family fed - I bled
Police pulled me over
But I fled
Ain’t no catching Gates
I’m working with a set of legs
I stand still
I try to give you examples
Of how this man feel
If I don’t catch you and kill you
This other man will
I got that tan still
Peanut butter ground ill
Let me catch your hand
In my can
Here come the blam - ill
You steal a wallet or a purse
To satisfy the hunger
Of your pockets
Till they burst - it’s worse
My partner’s sister youngin
Like to flirt
An older nigga raped her
I could never know the hurt
It hurts
It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts
It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts

[Chorus]
The game on freeze
But I be trapping in and out it
You gotta believe
That there ain’t no other way
Around it
I can’t sleep
But pray to God
That he find me
The shit won’t cease
They say they found another body
In the streets of BR
It’s the hardest way of living
The good die young
And the others go to prison
In the streets of BR
Listen close and pay attention
The Church ain’t safe
So I ain’t looking for religion
In the streets of BR

[Verse 2]
I grip boulders to pitch
To the real smokers
And buy stolen goods
From all of the deal holders
Food stamp card
Most of my meals’ frozen
Most of us deal dope
And all of us still tote it
Whoa hop out of the truck
With the chopper
Make us spray rounds
Lay down
This is not a playground
Ya heard me
Kay sounds
Tell him I’m on my way 'round
Ya heard me
I'm in all black
With the black mask and gloves
Double strap the tac
Go rrrr-at backin' 'em up
Line myself shells
Hell is where ya findin' em
Mine are to the streets
From the television monitor
First rule of the game
No trust no love
If I could just remember
That touch I’d sing something
Passed by rocking that Gates
They mean mugging
You niggas don’t exist in the game
You mean nothin'
You niggas don’t exist in the game
You mean nothin'

[Chorus]
The game on freeze
But I be trapping in and out it
You gotta believe
That there ain’t no other way
Around it
I can’t sleep
But pray to God
That he find me
The shit won’t cease
They say they found another body
In the streets of BR
It’s the hardest way of living
The good die young
And the others go to prison
In the streets of BR
Listen close and pay attention
The Church ain’t safe
So I ain’t looking for religion
In the streets of BR

[Verse 3]
Get away to a place
Where I’m good
Its raw women with AIDS
And they stay in my hood
To all niggas with braids
Got blazed where I stood
Small nigga with waves
Says Gates, it's all good

I do this cuz I love you
Consider it on a muscle
You had gave me the game
When I didn’t have a penny
You was the one who came
When them other niggas didn’t
Money over bitches
Anybody could get it
Hospital or ditches
Bicycles or fences
Layin low with intentions
Of coming out up out the trenches surrender
Can’t see it or witness
Can’t be it I see it
At the same time
But I can’t speak it
Nightmares from the night air
Stares and a groan slight
Glare from the right flare
Tears in the bone
Two bottles few models
Pair of patron
And the drum roll sound
Like snares when its on

[Chorus]
The game on freeze
But I be trapping in and out it
You gotta believe
That there ain’t no other way
Around it
I can’t sleep
But pray to God
That he find me
The shit won’t cease
They say they found another body
In the streets of BR
It’s the hardest way of living
The good die young
And the others go to prison
In the streets of BR
Listen close and pay attention
The Church ain’t safe
So I ain’t looking for religion
In the streets of BR
