[Verse 1]
Disassociating threes in the building (BARAAKAAA)
How they leave as we flee the scene
Brief apparition of my agenda, I'm just being me
Prayers in the seed to an upper being, just free'd the team
On my knees reaching for fire flies, think i know wings
Bitch I fell in love with Lil Meeky (WAAAAAH)
Off the amphetamines, ain't have alot
In fact she was happy, I wouldnâ€™t sell her dreams
Now i'm selling things, with the stamp on it
Teflon wrapper, closed hamper, putting tax on it
Hated on for my inevitable success, Still
Dealing with the devil I only know as myself
In the mirror i see is god and that only god is myself
Prayers answer, closed caption, Mr. Mathers no distraction
In the kitchen, no whippin, straight drop is manufactured
For the few that choose to be un-recreative with a habit
I'm recreative with a habit as i resorted to dog food
Discombobulation, which ever way that you call it..

[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like Marshall Mathers
Good hearted and prone to fuck up, my family hate me
Emotionally I'm scarred and what I love has betrayed me
(MATHERS)
Hate to say it sometimes i wish i wasn't created
Begging me to speak my mind, but don't like when i say shit
(MATHERS)
Stood strong surrounded by you Pinocchio's
Feared being exposed by a product out of a broken home
(MATHERS)
Made believers out of men as i approach the throne
Rappers grab for cover, I grab the cover of rolling stone
(MATHERS)

(sometimes i feel like Marshall Mathers..)

[Verse 2]
This goes out to those out there who hate to be alive
Searching for placement is being taken by surprise
Besides, its hard tryna always find the fun in they jokes
Always ended up the butt of they jokes (YOU FUCKING FAGGOT)
Contemplation of it ending with this pistol to my temple
Thinking if i pull this trigger will this semi take my misery away
Or would i just be killing me in vain
Relationship estranged, shorty asking how i deal with it everyday
Magazine filled, single mission or army
Up in the Benz with a mini and rip the arm of a target
Two time is talking, one coughing: the coffin called ya
Call it sugar in ya cafe, I could coffee call ya
Im in the boston market where niggas beefing from both sides
Detroits fine, searching for a line, all the dope dry
Talented, ghetto niggas looking for work
Conviction facing, most of them to get it out on the curb
Absurd

[Hook]
Good heart and prone to fuck up, my family hate me
Emotionally I'm scarred and what I love has betrayed me
(MATHERS)
Hate to say it sometimes i wish i wasn't created
Begging me to speak my mind, but don't like when i say shit
(MATHERS)
Still strong surrounded by you Pinocchio's
Feared being exposed by a product out of a broken home
(MATHERS)
Made believers out of men as i approach the throne
Rappers grab for cover, I grab the cover of rolling stone
(MATHERS)
Sometimes i feel like Marshall Mathers..
Sometimes i feel like Marshall Mathers...
