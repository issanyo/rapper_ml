[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Nigga told me it was cheaper to be myself, ya heard?
Then that same nigga told me it wasn't always cool to be me
What the fuck?
Always tellin' me that I was good for nothin'
I was never good or nothin'

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
All I know how to be's a ridah
Grind or die, I'll put that on the bible
All I know how to be's a ridah
Brains on the dashboard, probly no survivors
All I know how to be's a ridah
Prayin' for protection from the one that's right onside ya
All I know how to be's a ridah
Hood niggas (all I know)
Good pretenders
All I know how to be's a ridah

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
90 knocks in and out the spot for cream
90 shots hangin' off the big machine
See my sister cryin' they took her love away
All my niggas how we sellin' drugs for pay
I just [?] they wanna murder me
So I gotta keep a cannon every day
Whole family [?] we gotta find a way
Stomach full of lean because we lost our way
Make a [?] never [?]
[?]
I lose every girl 'cause I sleep with my rifle
Now I tell the world this

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
All I know how to be's a ridah
Grind or die, I'll put that on the bible
All I know how to be's a ridah
Brains on the dashboard, probly no survivors
All I know how to be's a ridah
Prayin' for protection from the one that's right onside ya
All I know how to be's a ridah
Hood niggas (all I know)
Good pretenders
All I know how to be's a ridah

[Verse 2: Mistah F.A.B.]
Damn, I can't believe they killed my nigga Jack
Had a dream the other night that I brought my brodie back
We was gettin' [?], smokin' out a Back, sippin' Act
'Cause that's how we use to do it, me and J and the Mac
Shit fuck with my mind and realize that he gone
Got me relapsin' back to back, blowin' out of the zone
I put that on my soul, never erase your number from my phone
Thug tears for thug angels, callin' heaven their home
A lot of suckas gettin' credit, but they fake and they fraudulent
'Cause they ain't shit without possessions, puttin' on shows for their audience
My brotha Jack taught me a lesson, that we don't care how hard he is
And that them niggas bleed too, regardless of who he thought he is
See, I was raised on the curbside
By pitchin' flippers, lettin' birds fly
And whoever kill the Jack, I sear to God I hope that nerd die
See a vision with my third eye, got my mind on murder
Mama didn't raise a bitch, bein' a coward was a nada

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
All I know how to be's a ridah
Grind or die, I'll put that on the bible
All I know how to be's a ridah
Brains on the dashboard, probly no survivors
All I know how to be's a ridah
Prayin' for protection from the one that's right onside ya
All I know how to be's a ridah
Hood niggas (all I know)
Good pretenders
All I know how to be's a ridah
