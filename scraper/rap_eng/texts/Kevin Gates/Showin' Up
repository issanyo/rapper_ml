I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up
All that ass you got behind you
Slim waist, all that ass you got behind you
I mean, I mean where the fuck they find you?
Where the fuck they find you?
I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up, showin’ up

[Verse 1]
Hold up, pause
Break the knob, speaker going out
Two big booty bitches, both cheeks poking out
If I feel played everybody getting robbed
This fine motherfucker corn on the cob
Listening to Three 6, slob on my knob
If I don’t know you I don’t wanna, I don’t like the vibe
Disrespect me, I’ma die, see it in my eyes
Hit my dog, hit the mall, what you did, drop a bag
Into fashion, I ain't bragging, 450, ate Italian
Got a chick, she Dominican and she half Italian
Portuguese on her, big knots going at her top
Throw some D’s on her, I’m a rich boy, I'm on top
Niggas sleep on you when you're bitch made
How can I tell my mama, she gon’ lose respect for me if I ain’t die
Bless her heart, she gon’ be upset me with me I ain’t fly
I’m retarded, I’m a dog, I’m a lil bhagyari dog
Pulling up, happy meals right outside of Benihana’s
Try to drink a million, know he really want to see me under
Muscle, no need to tussle, hater ‘bout to see me bubble
Nigga he be want to shoot the shit but he ain’t saying nothing
Got around a nigga, acting weird like he up to something
Drop 50 racks, backed back, another nigga touched them
Game played above his shoulder
Can’t think, get the shovel

[Hook]
Bad bitches wanna fuck me
Yeah, yeah, shawty love
Bad bitches wanna fuck me
Yeah, you know
Shawty love the way I
Shawty love the way I
Shawty love the way I
Way I’m cutting up
I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up
All that ass you got behind you
Slim waist, all that ass you got behind you
I mean, I mean where the fuck they find you?
Where the fuck they find you?
I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up, showin’ up

[Verse 2]
Hold up, pause
Break the knob, speaker going out
Attempts at the phone, you hear your beeper going off
I just hate Kevin Gates, he be showing off
Big name, getting heavy, horsepower on the Chevy
Money Wap, countin' Fetty, bad bitch, we together
Jugg man, another level, mansion crib, jewelry section
18k, plain jane, Lance bought a bezel
Freak or we can fuck wherever, get 'em sis, fuck ‘em up
All black 750 with the peanut butter guts
Who is this big fine motherfucker running up?
Pumps in the bump, booty going bumpabumpabump
Shoes on, watch me, drunk man, what the fuck
Beem, boom, beem, bam, boom, yeah, going dumb
Glock, boom boom boom, now you want to duck
You was on the gram talking tough, now you want to hug
Hundred fifty bands on the bluff, cuz get a cut
Moving on, better thoughts, cleaner weed, cleaner living
Kitchen bags at the cleaners, even made a cleaner killing
What he said? Fuck a nigga, I ain’t really get to hearing
Lately I been running out of seconds tryna get a minute
Using me a metaphor, I figured you would get the picture
Shawty bad, she a ten, blowing gas in Virgina
Express pass, had to get it, you ain’t get the picture?

[Hook]
Bad bitches wanna fuck me
Yeah, yeah, shawty love
Bad bitches wanna fuck me
Yeah, you know
Shawty love the way I
Shawty love the way I
Shawty love the way I
Way I’m cutting up
I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up
All that ass you got behind you
Slim waist, all that ass you got behind you
I mean, I mean where the fuck they find you?
Where the fuck they find you?
I’ma hit the dick on you, ain’t no cuddle up
She be showin’ up, showin’ up
