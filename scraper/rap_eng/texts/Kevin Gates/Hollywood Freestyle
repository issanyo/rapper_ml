[Verse 1]
Loyal to nobody but this thing of ours
Try to get cream 'til the whole team empowered
Ask Kevin Gates, don't be asking a nigga
I'd die 'fore I ever pay draft to a nigga
They shackled a nigga, I don't know how you loving life
Hassled a nigga only because the hustle right
Gotta be a great, I barely pick a pen up
Time to get established, trap's starting to pick up
I get a little action, I'm calling the clique up
Gates in love, he stay writing 'bout a bitch
Tablet on the shitter, writing when I shit
Can't make it, had to pay a working order fee
Bumps on my ass from a dirty toilet seat
Never between teeth, I say it aloud
They was forcing a abortion, trying to murder my child
It just started, but I aim to see finish
Can't walk away or change, I'm deep in it
My niggas that ain't caught up or slain, they defendants
But Gates ain't leaving the game, believe in it
Just started

[Outro]
What it do? It's Kevin Gates
And right now I'm kicking it with Hollywood Freestyles, HipHopDX
