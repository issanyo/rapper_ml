Ugh.. I'm finna find a O, Ion take L's
Still ridin' dirty, Ian got L's
I'm never smokin joints, all I smoke is L s
Still sellin weight, Ion need a scale
(Repeat x2)

(Verse 1)
Its pablo el chapo, hit me when you need it
In the streets I'm like mayweather, bitch I'm undefeated
My '86 cutlass, you know i cut the top off
Castle fully J's and Gucci belts, no knock offs
See I can show you niggahs how to make this money
Or I can show you niggahs how to take this money
Bitch I'm from baton rouge niggah, grinepave
I'm bout soft, I had a stove, I used the microwave
I'm still with my shooters, fuck a fight
I'm still ridin' 6's, ain't got no license
I made a 100 bands, shout out to melz
I'm still sellin pounds, ion needa scale

(Chorus)x2

Ion think they ready, I done jumped in it insane
Fish scales to the arm & hammer
Don't lemme forget them bags
Pants I like to sag, ian got a swag
Go ask yo bitch bout Luca Brasi, bitch I got them bags
4th floor with my tightest niggah, it's late night an we thuggin'
I went to jail, them niggahs stayed strong, if you need money i'm flushin'
I took an L on some oil based, when I tryed to rock it, it crumbled
Shook back like cooked crack, no ?, but I'm stuffin'
Tryna fade away from the blow
But I still came from under that, blowin' my nose
Tryna be ? , when they took that
No actin', I only provide 'em with O's
I'm thuggin' hard, let's get it
Niggah fuck bein to friendly
If we got you fiendin', for a meal ticket, tell pablo I sent ya
