[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Really hate to boast, do the most
Don’t go tit for tat
Really hate to boast, do the most
Don’t go tit for - hol’ up
That was all a joke
Up the road they don’t mention that
Let me stick to facts
Come to racks, I go rack-o-bat
Turn up on they ass, bitch I am Michael Jackson bad
Masi stick with rap, bitch I’m strapped
Do the murder dance
Keep up with my lingo, [?]
Remember what I told you
[?] band pussy, I’m bout cooking
Rather die a soldier
Hoes fall under Drika
I got the coke line and the reefer
In the VIP with the beeper
Foreign shit, valet for no reason
Made mouth game look like a freezer
That’s a quarter mill when I’m speaking
I said the mouth game look like a freezer
That’s a quarter mill when I’m speaking, gone

[Hook: T Rell]
It’s money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Tryna ball out the frame nigga
Bought new car fuck them jeans nigga
It’s money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Tryna ball out the frame nigga
Bought new car fuck them jeans nigga

[Verse 2: T Rell]
Flying through the sky like LeBron James
Get so much money that a nigga need his own bank
Got a bad bitch way badder than Beyonce
[?] shark swimming down in a fish tank
Never gave a damn or a fuck what a bitch think
Watch em [?], dip low as I switch lanes
Like bye Felicia
Can’t get money, then I don’t need ya
If you want a feature
Better talk cash or I’ll delete ya
Never really fucked with people
When it comes to cash you niggas so deceitful
Money make the world go round
Money make the girls come out
Money make you dress like this
Money make you floss that loud
Damn I really love that sound
Smelling like new money, but never get a dime from me
Nigga time’s money
I swear that you boys funny
I’m paid and your girl love me
Yeah your girl fuck me
You broke niggas so sick
You’re bored and your nose runny, stay away from me
You [?] I’m a big homie
[?] take the wheel from me

[Hook: T Rell]
It’s money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Tryna ball out the frame nigga
Bought new car fuck them jeans nigga
It’s money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Money to be made, nigga let’s get paid
Tryna ball out the frame nigga
Bought new car fuck them jeans nigga
