[Intro]
I ain't lie, know what's happenin' with me bae. I'm a fucked up nigga, I ain't gonna lie but I know that the first day I ever seen you, the first day I been around you, I know we was in love, I know this. You know how you feel, like fuck how it look, fuck thinkin' about it, I know how I feel. You know what I'm sayin'? And my heart don't lie to me, that's why I follow that motherfucker like this here bae, forreal

[Hook]
When you're alone at night and need somebody by your side
No matter wrong or right sayin' it's gonna be alright
No one'll hold you tight, no one'll look you in your eyes
As if it ain't okay to cry, try to be the tough guy
Think about you all the time, start to feel it backfire
No one love you like I, hope our love ain't expire
Tryna figure out why, dyin' on the inside
One day I'll get over my pride

[Verse 1]
I knew I loved you when I met you, some say this don't exist
Emotions captured, had to have you, ain't care who you was with
At your apartment off of Siegen, had a brief disagreement
You move back to Houston, we went like three years without speakin'
I got back on drugs bad while I was stillin' chasin' cheddar
My heart was broke, soft and stressin' battlin' with my depression
On top of that my team was shittin' on me harder than ever
Not a worry in the world whenever we was together
I flew you out to Miami, we laid up in the suites
Bathtub full of fruits while I was rubbin' your feet
We went to Bloomingdales, I bought us matchin' grey theory sweats
Said I ain't want you to leave before you boarded the jet

[Hook]
When you're alone at night and need somebody by your side
No matter wrong or right sayin' it's gonna be alright
No one'll hold you tight, no one'll look you in your eyes
As if it ain't okay to cry, try to be the tough guy
Think about you all the time, start to feel it backfire
No one love you like I, hope our love ain't expire
Tryna figure out why, dyin' on the inside
One day I'll get over my pride

[Verse 2]
Shoutout to Nard that's my personal trainer
He cool with you because of you I now treat him like a stranger
Big booty Shelby I know things ain't work with me and your sister
Best of what life has to offer love, you still my little sister
Pull up in vets, hear the engines, eight speed tiptronic transmission
Four door Porsche reminicisin'
Wishin' that you was here with me
I used to to tease you bout your feet
We would laugh and we'd giggle
And havin' breakfast on the beach
You don't know how much that meant to me
Holdin hands in Aventura Mall ,public affection
When you and me don't need no bodyguard, I'm your protector
Facetime, I can't wait until you call me, you special
You had that problem, now that problem solved, he won't disrespect you
Un-uhhhh, not ever

[Hook]
When you're alone at night and need somebody by your side

Think about you all the time, start to feel it backfire
No one love you like I, hope our love ain't expire
Tryna figure out why, dyin' on the inside

[Outro]
I not ever love, not ever
You know I never love, not ever
No-one respect you like
Kill someone if someone disrespect you love
I see you lookin' at my girl
Yeah she a fine girl
Yeah I love the way you whine girl
She from the islands she be ooh
And ain't no lookin' at my girl
