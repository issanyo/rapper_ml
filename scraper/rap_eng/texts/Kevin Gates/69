[Intro:Malachi]
Yeah, it's your boy Malachi
Kissin' me below my navel
Lickin' you below yours
Doin' some grown folks shit

[Bridge:Malachi]
Let me lick you up and down say shawty
I wanna do you things let's get it started
I wanna sing my song for you at my party
It's going down, aye
And what you me to do it's no problem
And if your man got a problem with that then I'll solve it
And I'ma lick lick lick you like that
Betcha won't go back
Cause I got you, aye

[Verse 1:Kevin Gates]
Other people might find it knida bizarre
Me kissin' you in the car or sexin at your job
While in the parking garage
I look at you like a star and you look at me like a player
Started chasin' my change and you started sayin' I'm changin'
I'm back to grippin' ankles, I'm kissin' all on ya nipples, I'm lickin' all on ya fingers
I'm lovin' seeing you naked
You crazy we trading places
I also know it's amazing by all the faces you makin'
Pullin' on my dreads repositionin' your legs
All around my neck while you lookin' up at the ceiling
Sucking all on your navel while fiddling with your kitty
I hope we don't wake the neighbors
You feel it all in your kidneys
Loud it ain't no whispering
We all know what the bidness is
Your friends act silly
They at the door while we getting it
You might think I'm tripping
I heard them while they was giggling
I'm dicking it ridiculous
Ooo wee I'm thick in it

[Hook:Malachi]
69
Here we go
We gone rock
Baby
We gone roll
I do you like this and I do you like that
Turn your ass around and let me hit you from the back
We gone rock
We gone roll
We gone do it just like grown folks
Face down Face down Face down
Yeah

[Verse 2:Kevin Gates]
Now as the sex scene unravels
Hold your ass still
Tell me what you like
You got your number one fan here
Gates been retarded
Eat the pussy like a last meal
Get your booty lick
Pull your hair
Get your back drilled
Spit all on your clitoris
I know you love how that feel
Naked in the trap
On the floor in the South
I was rubbing on your titty
With your toes in my mouth
You was all against the door
With some more on the couch
Face down in the pillow
While I stroke in and out
Incline with it arch
Thick thighs you a horse
It go *snort sound* made it talk
It go *farting sound* made it fart
Spirits get lifted
Here the uhhh in your voice
You a freak
Girl you wet all my jeans when you moist
Thinking bout me made you scream in the dark
Cocaine dick rod and the people snort
Cocaine dick rod and the people snort
