[Intro]
Man I swear to god I got some niggas out there in Shreveport so loyal it just don't make no fuckin' sense

[Hook]
That my nigga I call'em Blocka
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker
That my brother I call him hundred mane
La Familia and I put that on my momma
That my nigga I call'em Blocka
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker
That my brother I call him hundred mane
And I put that on my momma

[Verse 1]
Real nigga in the game, I know how to maintain
Rap and hustle, sell coke, bitch says the same thang
Countin' money like Shawn, big money like Don
Shout-out to my nigga Don Juan, gotta grip the bag with 2 arms
Got the weed comin' by the acres
Look like I robbed 2 farms
Jamaican cartel pull up, bad bwoy say "Wha gwaan?"
I just hit'em like whaaah
Still be goin' dumb
Mouth full of platinum bitches askin' where I'm from
Diamonds grill just like Master P my mouth be sayin' UGHHH
16 252's that's four bricks on a scale
And between me and you, I just got out of jail
Took my lick I ain't tell, and I know you wish you could be hidden

[Hook]
That my nigga I call'em Blocka
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker
That my brother I call him hundred mane
La Familia And I put that on my momma
That my nigga I call'em Blocka (block)
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker
That my brother I call him hundred mane
And I put that on my momma

[Verse 2]
Real nigga in the game, streets say the same thang
And if I get caught again, I'm goin' to the chain gang
Not afraid to take losses, gold mouth dawg we bosses
Tryna clip, ohh its gon' cost ya
You gon have to come take it off me
Whipped out in the foreign with a bad bitch named Lauren
Say she use to live in California
She don't speak English and she foreign
Say her ex-boyfriend borin'
Wanna drug dealer who important
Slangin' dope dick I'm retarded
Finger lickin' chicken in the trap house
Know they love me in the neighborhood
I ain't gotta hustle with the strap out
Ion care what niggas rap about, I ain't rappin' what they rap about
I'm the nigga niggas rap about
Murders gettin' reenact out
Kickin' rocks in the crack drought
Up the gat I ain't back down

[Hook]
That my nigga I call'em Blocka (block)
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker
That my brother I call him hundred mane
La Familia And I put that on my momma
That my nigga I call'em Blocka (block, block)
That my bitch I call her Betty Crocker (block)
That my brother I call him hundred mane (money)
And I put that on my momma
