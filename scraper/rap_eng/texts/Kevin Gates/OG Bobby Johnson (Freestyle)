[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Ayyy... Luca Brasi two nigga..
Ayyy... I don’t get tired..

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Cocaine whipping, in the Pyrex different
Flicking with the wrist, I don’t get tired!
Hit it with the ice, when it (crack) it’ll quick dry
Passed by the trap, that was something you could get by
Retawdid!
Stripper getting money by the Ziploc
Chilling outside, in the whip, with the 5th cocked
Face into my navel, sort of like a table
The bitch doing shit, got my dick in a lip-lock, Rollin
Aroma from the odor, kind of potent
Got me choking, when I’m smoking
Probably stroking in a Hitchcock! (Know it.)
Fast car, worth a couple mil
In New Orleans, the Lord knew it wasn’t from no Hip-Hop! (On it.)
We ain’t bragging, I ain’t laughing doing anything to eat
Big ma got the dog food boomin' in the East
Ghetto where we’re starving, wanna do it with the heat
Dirty house full of roaches, hear ‘em moving when you sleep
My nigga turned bitch, wanna do it we could beef
Have a wild loud session, metal chewing through your feet
Jag bout to pull up at the Air mark, Me and Stroke open up a track, it’s a landmark
What up?
Tall yellow bitch, cut the fan off
Turn into an animal, I’m leaning on Zan Bars!
Cut up!
Fed up with a nigga, he a hater, having issues with another nigga winning, why you mad for?
Brick after brick, I ain’t talking 'bout the back board
Alley boy, wash your blade, thugging in the back yard
O.G. Boobie Black, brought a mask and a Mac, Brrraack!
Matter fact, it’ll rip a nigga dashboard, (Dashboard?)
Five in the morning, when I rip around the bottom
In the black Porsche truck, with a stepper right on the side of me
I pray to God I won’t make it, he don’t hustle everybody
What I clutch on, what I got a crush on
Fuck no!

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Word around town I'm a suspect
Me and Donald steady stomping through your projects
Rest in peace, killer stone at the projects
Boobie Black, rep the Magnolia Projects!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!
Word around town I'm a suspect
Me and Donald steady stomping through your projects
Rest in peace, killer stone at the projects
Boobie Black, rep the Magnolia Projects!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black!

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Soulja Slim reincarnated, a lot of niggas hate
I got they women doing favors, I don’t get tired! (Get tired)
Feeling my demeanor, ain’t no ring around her finger
But I swear I’ve been invited to her fish fry
Beat the pussy from behind, Molly turned her up
Contender, no pretender, coming quicker than a zip-line
That was in her mind, I ain’t hit her with a pimp line
Zipper, she gonna get it with her teeth
She unzipped mine, nigga!

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Word around town I'm a suspect

O.G. Boobie Black!
O.G. Boobie Black! (B.W.A.)
Word around town I'm a suspect

Rest in peace, killer stone at the projects
Boobie Black rep the Magnolia Projects! (B.W.A.)
