[Intro: Lil Chuckee]
Phone bill, lights bills, gas bill, I got it
I, I got it, I, I got it
I, I, I, I got it

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
She need them bills to pay her bills
Money all in this floor
Co-coming out in her clothes
Going up and down on this pole
Need them bills to pay her bills
Gangsta shit do we really bound
Pence a second they hanging down
Diamonds blinging and they talking loud
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need the bills to pay her, bills to pay her, bills to pay her bills
She need them bills to pay her

[Verse 1: Lil Chuckee]
Got a phone bill, her light bill, her water bill in my pocket
The way she got all my money is like she stole my wallet
Raping my jeans how she all on me
She want that beat, that B E A T
To get her out of town, I got the money found
Is like she was just born and now she keeps her clothes on
Clap-clap on, clap on
She make it clap round of applaud
She whipping, she trapping
She ‘bout to take her drawers off
Like damn, my girl twerk it slow for me
Pop pop pop that, I'mma throw this money, shawty
Mula mula mula, her trunk set pranks
Spending all this money I'mma have to run to the bank

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Chuckee]
I told her do it with no hands
Look at her, showing off, doing it on a handstand
Bandz a’ make her dance, I love it when she dance
She shaking it so hard she got me hard up in the pants
All in the mirror, stiletto custom fifty
If he ain't trying to pay her bills, than she tryin’ to kick it
I made the party, I'm feeling good, so I'mma blow nine hundred
First of the month, it's bills time, so I'mma blow twelve hundred

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, get the trash back, I'm blowing cash
I-I-I'm looking for her; where she at?
You make a nigga fall in love, Goddamn, you're fine
Bring her back two times, let me get behind

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Chuckee]
They know I got it, got too much money
They can’t fit in my wallet
All in the mirror, 'round and 'round she go
Love the way she move when she drop it on the floor
Watch how she roll, moving slow
Fifties and hundreds is the only thing I throw
Don't stop, girl, I won’t move
Hop in my Ferrari and baby let's go

[Hook]
