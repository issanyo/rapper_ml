[Verse 1]
People try to get over
Always got some different shit to say
Show ya boy some love
You know I got you when I get it straight
That ain’t how its supposed to be
I’m strictly about my dividends
Friends got ridiculous
And started acting sensitive
Street nigga play the block
The truth is what you pick around
Real niggas about that issue
Automatic spittin' rounds
Steady born killer with a killer
Gripping on the Glock
I’d done had an argument
And finished it with 50 shots
Really something wrong with me
I’m no longer loving life
Paul never proud of me
He said I can’t do nothing right
My business is my benefit
I ain’t never reaching ya
School don’t agree with me
Never been no teacher’s pet
(you got kids with you main man
Why you be neglecting her)
Busy fucking her Erica
My bitch get more respect than her
Weird you know what it is
This is what I live for
And love with my lil' girl
I live [?]

[Chorus]
Stuck in the streets
So I’m - sucking my teeth
Gotta hustle to eat
While I’m - clutching my heat
The object of the game
Was to stack and get out of here
Shit’ll never change
Now I’m trapped can’t get out of here
Stuck in the streets
So I’m - sucking my teeth
Gotta hustle to eat
While I’m - clutching my heat
The object of the game
Was to stack and get out of here
Shit’ll never change
Now I’m trapped can’t get out of here

[Verse 2]
Been through the guerrilla shit
Lumped you could lean on me
Till a nigga smash us
And never pull our pants up
Something got us ignorant
Smoking weed front the law
Innocent harassing me
To make me get in front the car
Nigga tend to flash out
I’ll let him know what cash about
Grinding in the mess
Trying to pull a couple of stacks out
Bet you know how it be
Fuck whoever looking out
Quick to up and cook ya and to cook em
If they pulling out
First I let that thang go
You know how this thing go
Empty out your pockets
But you coming off yo chain ho
You know how this thang go
He know how this thang go
Time in the cage
Know exactly what the mess bout
Sitting in the prison
Go to rec when I’m stressed out
Best friend telling me
The game I should back off
Same nigga tried to blow my mother fucking back off
Same nigga tried to blow my mother fucking back off

[Chorus]
Stuck in the streets
So I’m - sucking my teeth
Gotta hustle to eat
While I’m - clutching my heat
The object of the game
Was to stack and get out of here
Shit’ll never change
Now I’m trapped can’t get out of here
Stuck in the streets
So I’m - sucking my teeth
Gotta hustle to eat
While I’m - clutching my heat
The object of the game
Was to stack and get out of here
Shit’ll never change
Now I’m trapped can’t get out of here
