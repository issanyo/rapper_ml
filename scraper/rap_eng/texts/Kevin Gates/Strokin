[Verse 1:]
Say my name out loud
In the pussy deep, you talk to me!
Looking at me like that, you did it all
Don't talk to me!
I been home like sixteen months
And the way that you call , like you never had dick at all
Kissing in the car
While in the park garage you go slipping off your bra
Oh, oh, damn your titties soft lifting up your skirt , slip your panties off oh, oh
Hands all over your body!
Licking on it all no feelings involved
Watching water fall took no time at all, pussy
What we doing won't hurt nobody!

[Hook:]
Looks like I've seen you in my dreams, or in a magazine
People asking who are we (when we roll around)
Though things are not as they may seem
Want you like you want me
Skip to this bed room scene
And it's going down!
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion

[Verse 2:]
As a gangsta I be putting her hands all the way behind her back
I'll be divin' when I be divin' she be dick dick dick
Fall off in the club, niggas say, 'what up?'
No walking around it, you're a bad bitch
I see you looking, I want the pussy , fuck, talking about it!
Leave with me, get fucked good
That gangsta shit, I'm all about it
On the floor, leave the bed made up
Real street, nigga, none of that made up
Lay you on your back with both legs up
Eat the dick with a lot of spit
Sixty-nine, we can try again
Love the way you smell love to feel your skin
Hands together, I'mma hold them back
Put the head in, and I throw it back
Arch you all the way to the ceiling
Get your booty licked while you make it clap
Uh, I'm nasty! A lot of tattoos get at me
Face underneath your waist
While my fingers scratching your scalp
You keep squirming all on my couch
You left nipple all in my mouth!
Ask them hoes about me, I kill pussy
I know you know what's that about!

[Hook:]
Looks like I've seen you in my dreams, or in a magazine
People asking who are we (when we roll around)
Though things are not as they may seem
Won't you like the you want me
Skip to this bed room scene
And it's going down!
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion

[Bridge:]
Now turn around
Sweating like a storm cuz we dont kid around
After this you could tell all your girlfriends
How I just dick you down!
While kissing on your shoulders, and I make you bend over
Give this dick like I'm supposed to
I'm strokin in slow motion
I'm strokin, now hold on
