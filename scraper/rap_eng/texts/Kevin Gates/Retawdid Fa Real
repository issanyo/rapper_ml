[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Is it my fit? My gems? Oh they know what it is
Believe what you like oh bitch I'm ballin' forreal
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know it's got a name but don't know what to call it forreal
My shawty something nice and she know what it is
I kill her from the rear she say she feel it in her ribs
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know its got a name but don't know what to call it forreal

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
They say there go Kevin Gates
My color scheme different
Banana Republic, cucumber, Aqua Marine Stitching
Ocean water retawdid
Flying men, a cheaper number
Play with me I go get peaded Millimeter squeeze in public
You see me fresh check out my collar
Lot of stacks don't need wallet
Got this bopper who talk proper balloon booty so I popped her
Big ol' dick I got a lot of, got some giggling
She bragging on it, my belt cute and I'm sagging on 'em
My glasses on and I'm swaggin' on 'em
When I rock Louis Vuitton, people stop and stare (Hat, scarf, belt, shoes x4)
Fell in Neiman Marcus at this Gucci love affair
Before life was like a movie groupies really wasn't there
And if it's something new by Coogi I'm completely unaware
Shoulder game, cone of option I'm opposite Louis Lane
Cone of poppin' Clark Kent out the pocket like Loa Slane
See I don't what you think, but they feel I'm retawdid
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Is it my fit? My gems? Oh they know what it is
Believe what you like oh bitch I'm ballin' forreal
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know it's got a name but don't know what to call it forreal
My shawty something nice and she know what it is
I kill her from the rear she say she feel it in her ribs
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know its got a name but don't know what to call it forreal

[Verse 2: Flame Gang Flow]
Fuck a Maybach I'm probably on a skate deck
For heaven sakes, I think its Flow and Kevin Gates
My weed is great, I'm in the bay I think it's great
The weed is laced
Aye suck my dick and make a steak
Oh, girl you look so sexy
Don't I know you from somewhere? Ain't yo name Alexis?
I kissed her on her neck, and then she start undressing
Now I'm bout to kill that pussy like I'm tryna get arrested
I say whoa Keemo Sabi, you know I keep it slimy
If I ain't with Lil Shottie I'm with Lasso Luchiani
Swag is astounding bad bitches baking brownies
And I get so fucking high I'm surprised you fucking found me
I'm a rapper and a skater, bet your ex they ain't know me
Bitch I won a Grammy and a X-Game trophy
[Cough cough] This weed got me coughing
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Is it my fit? My gems? Oh they know what it is
Believe what you like oh bitch I'm ballin' forreal
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know it's got a name but don't know what to call it forreal
My shawty something nice and she know what it is
I kill her from the rear she say she feel it in her ribs
It's retawdid, retawdid, retawdid, forreal
Know its got a name but don't know what to call it forreal
