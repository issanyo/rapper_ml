[Verse 1: Dre Rich Kidd]
Somebody told ya that I'd be up to no good
And I be riding around with a chick that I knew from my old neighbourhood
You don't have to ask, I'll take this time to confess
If you wanna know if I'm cheating, girl, the answer is yes
Wait, girl, before you go, won't you let me explain?
I be smashing these chicks on the low, but it's not the same
Why you acting so strange? I didn't expect this reaction
Thought you would be mad, but you over there laughing

[Hook: Dre Rich Kidd]
Now I'm thinking something going on, let me find out
That I'm not the only one who doing wrong, let me find out
That you got some other nigga in your phone, let me find out
Stepping out, let me find out you ain't here and some other nigga chill
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out

[Verse 2: Dre Rich Kidd]
That's why you stay at your mama's for the weekend
Let me find out you was with some nigga creeping
And when you say you go to church
Let me find out you was with somebody else, putting in work
I know they say what goes around, comes around and that's so true
Thought you were the exception, never thought it would be you
Now bad that your confession, tryna keep it true
These little thoughts keep creeping in my mind, could I have been so blind?

[Hook: Dre Rich Kidd]
Now I'm thinking something going on, let me find out
That I'm not the only one who doing wrong, let me find out
That you got some other nigga in your phone, let me find out
Stepping out, let me find out you ain't here and some other nigga chill
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Baby, I can't even make the past go away
Relationship bad, hold up, wait
Dranking syrup and pouring Ace
Everything we had thrown away
Tattoos, pain, gone away
Teardrops on a nigga face
Text Red, say she on the way
Watching movies, steady blowing bricks
Margielas on the coffee tables
Raw wraps, roll up all the papers
Good you gone, he done a favour
All natural, I don't like a flavour
Weed good, I'm just tryna taste it
Money bag, I'm just tryna chase it
Both scheming, why the fuck you playing?
This nig here, what the fuck his name?
You better tell me, better not try and save him
In the streets, really living gangsta
Silly me thinking the pussy for me
I ain't never been a hater
Let me find out my life in danger
No rubber, fucking with a stranger
You was mad, fucking outta anger
I was cheating, maybe that explain it

[Hook: Dre Rich Kidd]
Now I'm thinking something going on, let me find out
That I'm not the only one who doing wrong, let me find out
That you got some other nigga in your phone, let me find out
Stepping out, let me find out you ain't here and some other nigga chill
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
Let me find out, let me find out, let me find out, let me find out
