[Chorus]
Grinding comes with who we are
Diamonds in my moving car
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Grinding comes with who we are
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Nothing’s wrong with movie stars
Air traffic control
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like

[Verse 1]
No affiliation - uneasily intimidated - by loud sounds
Breadwinner round - table round
I don’t play inbounds
Hard to weigh in pounds
As profound - found townhouse
Oxford flannel - courtesy of Thom Browne
Down south
I’ll be John Brown in living color - belligerent
Structure keep my foot on a buster
I only suck at sucking metaphors
Used in implicating that I suck at nothing
Pardon me for teaching no distractions
You’ve been interrupted (get em)
Hoe with a hoe (what)
No chick I’m trustin'
Quick consumption
Stick her shove her
Lick her stomach kiss her hug her
He find out she’s been with me
Here come questions - kick her punch her
Symptom from the pencil
Sick enough to get us rich for nothing
I shit for nothing - pattern example
Yield the type of drop the type of fire
That lift them higher than scaffold building
They said they made Gates
How you build a building
Get the base safe field of dreams
Not a Wringley Field’n

[Chorus]
Grinding comes with who we are
Diamonds in my moving car
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Grinding comes with who we are
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Nothing’s wrong with movie stars
Air traffic control
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like

[Verse 2]
Biggie Small, Pac, and Jay-Z
Still my favorite rappers
Getting paper wasn’t talking paper
When it came to tablets
Money off the book
Made famous off paper tablets (scribble)
Fornications of the mouth
As in Kevin Gates
Ghetto beggin' - beggin' for better
Bet I’m in better shape
Behind this accepted from heaven
Posses an iron fist
Me not entertaining - attention taken
By [?]
Don’t think I’m Big Meech
Quoted Tyrus Thomas
This how we gon’ eat
Until I die and my body’s embalmed with
Embalming fluid
Be fruitful or foolish
As opportunity pursues
Be useful and use it
Using names loosely
Being loose get you smooched
With an Uzi
Oops - I’m in Jupiter cooling
Hungry no snoozing, I’m drooling
Tempted to shoot while I’m shooting
Thought he was food and I chewed him
Took over the booth nobody you
Show me who I’mma boot em
Timberland’s tan - try the boot
Get the boot in your booty

[Chorus]
Grinding comes with who we are
Diamonds in my moving car
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Grinding comes with who we are
Pray that we don’t lose an arm
Nothing’s wrong with movie stars
Air traffic control
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like
I put on a show tonight
Something that I think you might like
