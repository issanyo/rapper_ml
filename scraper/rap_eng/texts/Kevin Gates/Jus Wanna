[Intro]
Excuse me, you're not a plug
So I why are we speaking for?
Excuse me, you're not a plug
So I why are we speaking for?
Excuse me, you're not a plug
So I why are we speaking for?
Excuse me, you're not a plug
So I why are we speaking for?

[Chorus]
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
Girl you some action I've never seen
Girl you some action I've never seen
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I used to deal with your padre, a long time ago
Since then I moved on, but I still deal dope
Takin' trips out to Bogota, I used to catch hard sales
I was in love with your madre comida
Now I got my own cartel

[Verse 1]
Came from Puerto Rico, move to New Orleans
South Baton Rouge, sellin' cocaine
Don't you feel the love in the air?
(You can smell the drugs in the air?)
When you come to Colombia
When you come to Colombia

[Bridge]
Girl you some...
Girl you some action I've never seen
And you a brick of that Medellín
Don't you feel the love in the air?
In the air
You can smell the drugs in the air
In the air
When you come to Colombia

[Verse 2]
I am not a king nor a don
I am something way far beyond
At night I make solander to stars
I be singin' praise to Allah
I be up all night
We were children when we first met
Playing in poppy fields
Running through heroin
Didn't even know what it is
Helping papi crush the coca leaves
That was way before machines
Used to love visiting the villa
Making noise praying no one hear us
Goddamn i dont wanna leave
Damn i dont wanna leave..
You mi caramelito
And I gotta ship the perico
Dinero in Norteamérica
And I gotta get it back overseas
And I gotta get it back overseas
Dinero in Norteamérica
And I gotta get it back overseas

[Chorus]
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
Girl you some action I've never seen
Girl you some action I've never seen
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I used to deal with your padre, a long time ago
Since then I moved on, but I still deal dope
Takin' trips out to Bogota, I used to catch hard sales
I was in love with your madre comida
Now I got my own cartel

[Verse 3]
Run it up, bein' broke a bad dream
Fast car with the NASCAR seats
Jaguar with the all black feet
Z06 spillin' Act on me
Hit the mall, I run out of shit to buy
Ball, got a lot of shit that I supply
Lick mine then you know I gotta ride
Bitch that I'm with, she won't even visit
I ain't even trippin', fuck her, she can die
Dyin' inside, thinkin' homicide
Bye, cold world I hate to be alive
Letters, I am contemplatin' suicide
Say I'm keepin' this between you and I
Wanna make love, she ain't got the time
Always in her feelings, blamin' it on business
I just got a mistress, fuck her intuition
I want you to know I'm lovin' somethin' else
I want you to know I'm lovin' someone else
I want you to know I'm fuckin' in your bed
I hope what I wrote be fuckin' with your head

[Outro]
You should have tried to hold on to me
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
You should have tried to hold on to me
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
You gon' miss me one day
You gon' miss me one day
You gon' miss me one day
You gon' miss me one day
You should have tried to hold on to me
You should have tried to hold on to me
