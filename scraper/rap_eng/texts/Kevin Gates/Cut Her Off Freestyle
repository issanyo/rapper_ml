[Intro]
Yeah
It ain't nothin' to fuck yo bitch dog

[Verse 1]
Starin' at me like the damsel in distress
Acapulco diamonds and they dancin' on my neck
Flawless no inclusions we don't fuck with VVS
Fall off in the club and its cardiac arrest
Her cardiac arrest
Maliyah dancin' to my song
I'm a plug who make music I'm like Tego Calderon
Still I'm bout that gangsta' shit so please don't rub me wrong
I need to see you naked with no clothes when I get home
Slighty narcissistic bae so please don't read me wrong
Dickmatized her, dick amazing, and she blowing up my phone (won't leave me alone)
Bitch I'mma killer
Up in her cervix she screaming its murder, her face in the pillow
Pulling her hair, while I nibble her ear, and I’m fucking her slow and we all in the mirror
Hold up, Oh well
Left the ho at the hotel
Bungee jumping, my line chirping, bout' to go and catch me a sale
(Bae don't leave) You trippin', you can stay here or come with me
Whipped up at the gas station bought a box of Goodies and a digit
Need sixty dollars on pump four cause the gas tank like empty
Won't play the game like 2 Chainz, ain’t riding around but I'm gettin' it
Pull up at the trap, I'mma text ya phone like "I'm over here come get it"
Buggati, fucking with Brittany
Told her "I'm sorry" she say she forgive me
Entangled in my conversation as if I'm a Judas she look at me different
Would we get in trouble for fucking each other cause I use to fuck with your sister
I heard that your pussy get wet as a river and possibly need some assistance

[Bridge]
Oooooooohhh it ain't nothin' to fuck yo' bitch dog
Yo' bitch dog
It ain't nothin' to fuck yo' bitch dog
It ain't nothin' to fuck yo' bitch dog
Nigga, fuck you and yo' big dog

[Verse 2]
Retawdid', reading my aura, I'm too intelligent that why you bothered
Know it’s a name but don't know what to call it
My name is Kevin but she call me awesome
South by Southwest was performing in Austin
Ignored the BS and I ain't bout no talkin'
Can’t see you niggas, my clip in the carbine
Don't make me spray this bitch like Madd Marvin
(Bitch what you ain’t hear me?) Bitch don’t make me spray this bitch like Mad Marvin
Hold up, I say I don't get tired!
Blessing in disguise, this for those no longer with us while we out here on the grind
May God be with your families while you rest up in the skies
Shout out Roy and Ryan nigga’ dipping through that nine
I'm loving on Lil NaNa I met her at a Second Line
Bread Winners Association, still I'm out my mind
Drika booty bigger than a bitch I grip her from behind
And can we have a threesome I know that she don't mind
Know it's warmer than a sauna stroke her for a long time
Bae told the bitch to get here
Then she got off in the bitch ear
Got to feelin’ on her, never been molested came out her clothes then we rip
We a power couple don't trip
We a power couple that trick
Bread Winner escort service we'll buy bitch a new whip
Broke hoes car break down can't afford to get the bitch fixed
Fake bags in a air mattress can't afford to get the shit fixed
Plug, I'm in the socket
Thought I was sleep when you went in my pocket
Bitch I caught ya' (Oh my God!)
Don't make me spray this bitch like Madd Marvin

[Outro]
Shit, we ran't out of beat
I don't get tired
You know I'm all the way out there nigga
