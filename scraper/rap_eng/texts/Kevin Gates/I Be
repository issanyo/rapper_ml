[Hook]
I be in the hood, I be in the trap
I be with the shooters, I be busting straps
I be (x9)
I be with them killers, I be with them dealers
I be with them strippers, I be with them real niggas
I be (x7)

[Verse 1]
You ain't met a nigga like me
Run through shit like me
South-side legend like me, [?] kill and the street
Who the fuck won't shed me? Can let a nigga check me
Pull up in the hood, nobody touch my G
Droppin nuts on the track, I stand up and trap
Go hard in the paint, what you really know about that?
Too real way before rap, took a break from the trap
Hunnit block on the news, I had to fall back
Pull up in all black
We jumped out with the strap, we don't really know how to act
Young nigga gon a cab
Inperfect gon' ich
South-side nigga we gon' bitch
Speak to you like a preacher
See if you came for a feature

[Hook]
I be in the hood, I be in the trap
I be with the shooters, I be busting straps
I be (x9)
I be with them killers, I be with them dealers
I be with them strippers, I be with them real niggas
I be (x7)

[Verse 2]
Young, rich and I'm rolling
In a car that's not stolen
Yea I'm on parole but the pistol I'm holding
I say Dreco, you say [?]
About my pace n bout my lego
[?] dripping like [?]
We 100 ain't no Fredo
O.G Bobby Johnson
Nigga pealing your potato
I got killers on a payroll
They go movin, Dreco say so
If I'm not witnessing my business get your ass in Halo
(Say hello to my little friend, hello)
Ain't no talking about me, pussy scared to talk about me
And if they talk about me, quicker way to get it bout me
All these killer around me, number drug dealer around me
What the fuck you think? Goin on we decline counter

[Hook]
I be in the hood, I be in the trap
I be with the shooters, I be busting straps
I be (x9)
I be with them killers, I be with them dealers
I be with them strippers, I be with them real niggas
I be (x7)

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Landlord on my error
Still correcting my errors
Designer belts and morgelas
In a jail cell, no tellin' (braa)
Keep chest cold, rock ice water
Got a broke wrist, I put ice on it
Wrist game, got a 6 brain
But the doctor said I can't write on it
I ain't really go to high school but a slide through I got options
G'ed up when I read up
Keep the heat talk, no pocket
Lil bitch nigga that sent niggas she ain't never caution nobodys
Nigga tried to job me but shot me
I came back and I got him
Hoes want to fuck Bread Winners
Ain't nothing fucking with Brasi
Louis belt but I'm gucci
Stroke with me, we stupid
Straight face in the club silence
Said a cheque Nikey just do it
Bread Winners Assoication that's probably Menace and Boobie
Salute
