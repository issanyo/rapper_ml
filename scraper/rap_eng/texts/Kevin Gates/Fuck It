Lil Bro: Man, fuck your DJ

And all that shit
Lil Bro: Fuck em, what can they do for me
KG: You right, My nigga fuck your DJ
Kg: Lil Bro, you gotta turn my shit on...
So the hoes can be on my dick

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it
I ain't scared to go to jail
I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin
Fuck him
My block roll, outta of control, phone jumping
Just seen a fight, my lil hoes with the scuffling
Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it
I ain't scared to go to jail
I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin
Fuck him
In the drought we gon' eat yellin "FLOOD IT"
Took my lick when I went in I'm 100

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Heroin swag cut up bad my new Mac, Kodak Black
Gold buttons, hold up yeah, Pour up
Wait that was Mazi line first
A lot of niggas been dabbing lately that was Mazi lil work!
No leash, pitbull in the streets
On the dead end, watch how I make it jump
Status in the game, I ain't stretching cane
Mentioning my name, Customers will come
Ooh get 'em Gates, hold up get in there
Bitch get it straight, I got 50 pounds
I am not popping bottles on they ass
Full auto, hit the throttle on they ass
Wasn't trying when my pockets doing bad
Now I'm bout to go and really make 'em mad
Fuck how they feel, I don't take it back
Catch a fade in my younger days
Zip shit quick, put you up
Rendall bitch you know what up
Rock one, yeah keep it up
Nuk stuck with me through the clutch
I ain't never seen him switch it up
Villy tell lil J I say what up
Hold your head, Iâ€™m fuckin' with you tough
I love your mama, know we had it rough
Gangster Reezy I was looking up
Trell saw me get it out the mud
He didn't have a shower just a tub
Big Jimmy house on eleventh
12 Big London I'm a stepper
Stanley called me Kevin Marcellus
Get it

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it
I ain't scared to go to jail
I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin
Fuck him
My block roll, lot of control, phone jumping
Just seen a fight, my lil hoes with the scuffling
Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it
I ain't scared to go to jail
I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin, I'm thuggin
Fuck him
In the drought we gon eat yelling "FLOOD IT"
Took my lick when I went in I'm 100

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Boobie black went to jail
Streets, I was in 'em knee deep
Real Magnolia die-hard's
Pulling up to get weed
Me and Gunna locked up together
Way back think we did in 90s
UNLVG, Uptown Niggas Livin Grimy
[?] yo [?] bitch I miss you
You still in the trenches, I been grinding
Menace on my mind, I kept it silent
Fuss, fight, argue but I'm diving
Lately feeling like I've been surviving (I did)
Jumping out with Raunchy montana
Out in Watts, cooling out in Cali
Compton menace hit me you know what's happening
I just sent it, You ain't get the package ?
Miami, hold up man, I'm just rapping
Trapping, run it up, I'm just camping
I ain't seen Cree-Cree but once
Understand it, she gon understand it
In Tarzana, I'm tryna build a mansion
In Topanga, I see Kylie Jenner
Sometimes I see Tyga with her
Neiman Marcus, I just went retarded
I got money problems
Get the picture?
100 pints of Ac' and I'm quick to spend it
Islah thuggin that's my daughter laughing
Ain't too many times ain't caught her happy
Conversation crosses look what happen
Pussy street nigga you a rapper
Run up on me, come and see what happen
I'mma die, I ain't from this planet
My lil son bad, I'm his daddy
Your baby mama used to be a daddy
Grown man, you still got a daddy

[Outro: Kevin Gates]
You still got a daddy, man be for real
Like you is a little boy
Hey look it's Kevin Gates, you heard me?
'Preciate you for joining me...
On this adventure that we 'bout to go on
This is Murder for Hire 2
Man let's get into some shit
