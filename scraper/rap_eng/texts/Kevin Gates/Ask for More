[Intro]
I mean, I'm really, this how I'm livin', you know what I'm sayin'
Just tell 'em live it up

[Hook]
Hundred thousand what you mean?
Money hangin' out my jeans
Double cups stay on lean
Bad women all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all I see
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?

[Verse 1]
I'm rockin' designer, relax and reclinin'
Back of the Audi and I got a pilot
Watch me, I'm flyin'
Flyin' so high
The fuck do you mean pussy nigga? Don't ruin my vibe
I'm not comin' down, got my feet off the ground
Elevated my sound, don't hate on me now
This loud got me lost in the clouds
I'm rollin' up another right now
I wonder would she ride for me?
Would she hold it down if I wasn't free?
If I gotta go then I gotta leave
She can hold the bands and the keys

[Hook]
Hundred thousand what you mean?
Money hangin' out my jeans
Double cups stay on lean
Bad women all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all I see
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?

[Verse 2]
Some want my fetish, money countin'
Most likely need a new account
Seen her blew a thousand
I just wanna graduate, she can move from round me
On my head, think he had a bounty
Call me country, flyest in your county
Call me ugly, I just D'd her down
Matchin' luggage, she gon' need a gown
Packin' up and ain't no need to frown
Dice game, roll on the floor
This a gamble you ain't gotta answer
Moment I was broke you were gold
Benz coupe bet game over
Long wheel base Range Rover
No tint, still ain't seein' me
CLS, AMG machine
Red wine sippin', blowin' limbs
Planted seeds, now we growin' M's
Camouflage thermal jama set
On the phone choppin' it with vets
Big booty come and watch a movie
Nah my nigga I ain't wrap her yet
Somebody at my door, I gotta check
Eff with me tommorow, that's a bet

[Hook]
Hundred thousand what you mean?
Money hangin' out my jeans
Double cups stay on lean
Bad women all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all on me
Bright lights all I see
Bright lights all I see
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
How could I ask for more? How could I ask for more?
