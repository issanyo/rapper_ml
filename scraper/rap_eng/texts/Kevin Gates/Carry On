[Hook]
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
(Always potent with my rappin', accurate with timing)
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on grinding
(Always potent with my rappin', accurate with timing)

[Verse 1]
Time to speak up and tell my story to the people
Success is in the next room, I saw it through the peep-hole
Should I use the key or should I budge in like a "negro"
The industry is cold but I'm 50 below zero
I do this from the heart, you just leave the beat on
You know we go hard, lyrical libido
Spinning heads more than a 325 beamer
Your skills ain't sick, but mine give you a fever
Kevin's in the building, who turned on the heater
You gotta live fast, Ariba Ariba
I always stay fresh, ahoy Mr Beaver
UKevin una mandla so the crowd goes Viva
Killin' Izinyogas tryna steal my shine
Like a fish on a hook, I lift you up with my lines
I'd say im down to Earth but I'm always so phly
Shawty go low, nah lets just get high

[Hook]
Carry on Hustling, carry on Grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on Grinding
Carry on Hustling, carry on Grinding
(Always potent with my rappin', accurate with timing)
[Repeat x1]

[Verse 2]
Second verse and you know it only gets meaner
I'm rappin' real ish, you just play with rhyme schemas
Flowing like The Lakers, and ballin' like the Stealers
Got enough sperm, I dont wanna rap for peanuts
Talent so high, I'm young, black and gifted
Trouble on every corner but homie I'm drifting
Too fast and furious, shades black tinted
You can't see past my shades, im pimpin'
More real than Sgubu of SABC1
Kevin spits magic, my pen is a wand
Killin fake rappers and preventing any birth
Too real, you even believe it on April the 1st

[Hook]
Carry on Hustling (yeah), carry on Grinding (grind)
Carry on Hustling (hustle), carry on Grinding (grind)
Carry on Hustling (hustle), carry on Grinding
(Always potent with my rappin', accurate with timing)
[Repeat x2]

[Outro]
We livin' fast out here, yeah
Better say thanx to the rewinder
