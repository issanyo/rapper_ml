[Chorus]
Feel like I been on for a minute
Only when my whole team is winnin'
I been goin' off for a minute
Talk slick when they see me start grinnin'
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih

[Verse 1]
When Raunchy hit my line, I'm 'bout to glide to California
Compton Menace'll come scoop me from the airport if I wanna
Laid back, fishin' for plugs, we coulda died in California
I don't give a fuck, I want my daughter to witness
Get a man who like your father, no lil' boy who never lived it
Pouring syrup in the drink, depression hurt me every way
Boulevard male hit the dank
Wanna see you win, get it straight
Lot of 'em probably say I don't love 'em, I don't spend enough time with 'em
Stickin' to what's left of the G-code is where you find get 'em
Weed dead in the hospital, his mama in the hospital with him
Nuk in the same hospital, I was in the bed with Shakira
My phone rang by the hour, Teeka called, why she cryin'?
Pig dead out the bottom
Thinkin' how Iâ€™m gon' live without you
Tall nigga kinda hate it
He was happy that a nigga down
Thankin' Jesus for the heater
When he hopped out y'all ran from him
Steel on a late night he'll come and get the yey

[Chorus]
Feel like I been on for a minute
Only when my whole team is winnin'
I been goin' on for a minute
Talk slick when they see me start grinnin'
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih

[Verse 2]
Late night I think 'bout where we posed to be
Where we go from here
I don't fuck with pussy niggas, only fuck with real
I even love some pussies, always had me in some shit
Fist fighting for 'em and jumpin' out with iron slangin' stick
[?] shot at my feet, [?] knocked out my teeth
We scuffled, he say he loved me, "I love you too, keep it street"
E-man went called my uncle, then he copped a plea
Told 'em I had snuck him 'fore I hop in the street
Rest in peace Lil Ced, I'm like "Why you had to leave?"
Somebody played then they dead, man that's how it had to be
I'm tellin' Draco "go suit up, you clutchin', I'm clutchin'"
I was goin' eat that food, you know how I be comin'
Behind [?] grippin' a biscuit, walk you down all in public
My daughter died, I make the streets cry, Berto I love you
J Real you my brother, let's go harder for nothin'
Only reason the beef breathin 'cause you told me "I love ya"

[Chorus]
Feel like I been on for a minute
Only when my whole team is winnin'
I been goin' on for a minute
Talk slick when they see me start grinnin'
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih
I'm tellin' y'all
Get off my ih
