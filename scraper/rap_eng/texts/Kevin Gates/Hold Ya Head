[Hook]
This goes out to those who in the grave
Loved ones in the grave, the others doing time
But we'll be just right
Hold your head, hold your head
But don't ever hold your head down
Everybody love it when you're broke, hate it when you shine
Back against the ropes, no frowns, we still smile
Hold your head, hold your head
But don't ever hold your head down

[Verse 1]
Got it out the mud serving local in the trap
Couple faggots wanted me wacked, had me clutching gats
Pumping crack, crack smokers quickly coming back
I do about 55 ounces off of brick, it's jumping back
Neighborhood record label popping in my city
Dreadlocks, aqua green collar with a fitted
Headlock label say if I leave I get a headshot
Signed one contract, business venture proposal
Pay close attention, tricky dealing with hidden motives
Like I said I signed one contract, but noticed
Went to jail, came home, label playing me closer
Showed me two contracts with my signature and my social
What the fuck is that?

[Interlude]
Let's be honest. When you check into a hotel and you sign for your room you don't write your motherfucking social security number next to your signature. I come they got my social next to my shit on two contracts. I only signed one

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All I they ever told me was how blessed I was to be under them
Reaper'll kill you, God's children ain't the children of men
This for those who got picked on and teased all their life
Unspoken motives of the cruel, on my knees every night
Black termal up under army fatigue with a pipe
Itching a brick of biscuit, no need to mimick pretenders
Indeed I eat a business when enemies would befriend you
Until they see you defenseless and send a nigga to flip you
Strictly dealing the district, they leave the building, it's history
Back controlling the city with vacuum sales and them digits
Shitting on you bitches who wouldn't lend me a penny
Smiling everytime I'm sticking my dick in one of your women
Gates

[Interlude]
A wise man told me that to get what you want you gotta know what the fuck you want. A wise man also told me that a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. I'm up in focus
