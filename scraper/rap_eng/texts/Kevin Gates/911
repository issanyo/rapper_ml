[Intro]
Know I'm into playing soccer and I'm into boxing
Every round fresh body you know how I'm rocking
I don't usually do this
Every round fresh body you know how I'm rocking

[Bridge]
Hoping and praying that you gon' give it up tonight
And I'm calling you 'cause I need you
Aquafina, girl I'm beeping

[Verse 1]
Ooh, surfing on the wave girl
And we could make a splash aw
Baby what you saying?
Bout another round or what
Bitch you got my gun unloaded
My ego is big can you stroke it
You sipping the liquid courage
Keep driving but watch when you swerving

[Pre-Chorus]
You the truth, you the one, you the illest
You the one who got my girl catching feelings
Not now, really you be on some chill shit
You just pull up and you hop out and you kill it

[Chorus]
911, 911, murder murder, murder murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em
911, 911, it be a murder, a bloody murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em

[Verse 2]
Blaow, blaow blaow blaow blaow
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all man down
Something's telling me you want it
My intuition never wrong way
Kiss it soft, kiss it slow, kiss it strong, yeah
Pick me up, you be calling my phone, yeah
I got my eye on you like a cyclops
Moon walking Michael Jackson with the white socks

[Pre-Chorus]
You the truth, you the one, you the illest
You the one who got my girl catching feelings
Not now, really you be on some chill shit
You just pull up and you hop out and you kill it

[Chorus]
911, 911, murder murder, murder murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em
911, 911, it be a murder, a bloody murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em

[Verse 3]
Wet, wet, licking on your neck
If anybody find out they gon' be upset
You know how I'm living love, he is not a threat
I don't flex
You a fine girl tell me where they find you?
Bend it down girl beat it from behind you
Lean it over bust it open I'm behind you
I pull your hair and smack your ass when I'm behind you

[Bridge]
Hoping and praying that you gon' give it up tonight
And I'm calling you 'cause I need you
Aquafina, girl I'm beeping

[Chorus]
911, 911, murder murder, murder murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em
911, 911, it be a murder, a bloody murder
911, 911, yeah you heard 'em, yeah you heard 'em
