[Intro]
Sometimes you gotta put your pride to the side in this game that we call life
You know I'm tryna get back to my kids
You know I can’t win with these crackers
I'm a nigga, and they look at me like a nigga
Like [?] and lie down real quick, fuck it

[Verse 1]
No self worth bein' honest
But I converse with some bosses (I do)
I’m a real earner and I worked hard
Thanking God look what I accomplished (Allahu Akbar)
Inside support system awkward
Take time with trial, only options
Division nine, no PC in Chicago, fighting drama
My relationship gettin' rocky
No spousal trust, I was movin' unconscious
I was talking with Jay and [muted] recruited a move that allotted me counsel
Back and forth without representation embarrassin' ran out of options
Told my attorney go get with the DA
He come with a deal and I'm coppin'
Aiming for 36 months but he came with a 30 so fuck it, I signed it
He think I'm stupid, well fuck what he think
I ain't fight with them crackers, I got out they way
Stateville, now I’m going up state with the gang members
They respectin’ my name
You one of the mean, you play with the kid
You gon have to kill 'em you one of the greats

[Chorus]
No need to say it, I was sufferin’
My head hurtin' of concussion
Broke bed on me fuck it
I don't think they really love me
Trust issues, I'm accustomed
Writers block, no question nah
Already knowin’ you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
Ain't no need to discuss it
We have a heated discussion
Internet beef, I don't entertain
I know how to come up from nothin'
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
I'm gettin' straight to the money(yeah)
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it

[Verse 2]
I'm an energy person and I'm at ease
But the minute you hurt me you gotta leave
Got some niggas who love me, they outta reach
Got some children who comin' up, gotta teach
Got some family who mad cause they tryna leach
Got some big booty woman who I don't need
Master manipulation, been manipulated
But it really don't bother me
Gold trim platinum, matte white Benz
V12, yellow color baguettes
Red guts, panoramic, my roof
Any given moment I can hop in a jet
In the weight room gettin' rid of weight
Pat touchdown, doin' a set
Hit the space bar, click and refresh
Making salat when I need to reset (Allahu Akbar)
Turnin' the pot got me whippin' the vet
On the phone, communication with the joint
Still going in tryna prove a point
I don't socialize, I don't see the point
50 wrapped up, stuffed in a bump
Underneath the trunk
Order what you want
Laying in the trunk sipping red wine
I don't give a fuck
I do what I want

[Chorus]
No need to say it, I was sufferin'
My head hurtin' of concussion
Broke bed on me fuck it
I don't think they really love me
Trust issues, I'm accustomed
Writers block, no question nah
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
Ain't no need to discuss it
We have a heated discussion
Internet beef, I don't entertain
I know how to come up from nothin'
I'm gettin' straight to the money
I'm gettin' straight to the money
Already knowin' you gon' lie to me, ain't no need to discuss it
