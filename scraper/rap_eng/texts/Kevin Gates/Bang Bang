[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Fuckin' with the plug daughter
Made a young fortune
And my lungs coughin’
When I'm done torchin‘
Broke down bricks I'm a slum lord
Jump off fresh make the gun charges
3-door coupe when I'm done talkin’ 
Who ya chick love, never once called her
In the driveway I'm not the one stalking
In designer stores I'm the one flossin’

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street 
Name another that you think go harder than me (watch me go) 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice fore you speak
Here to take the crown and I mean by any means (my shit go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street 
Name another that u think go harder than me (watch me go) 
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice for you speak

[Verse 2: Trevor Jackson]
Got signed 3 years ago no album out (whoa)
The frustration is an understatement should I end the drought (yea)
Got the world like damn can he do it?
Is he really up for the task?
I laugh at the fact that you ask 
It’s like can flash really run fast
Shout out to the ones who knew from the jump
That I'm that nigga 
And to the ones who never showed up
Man I’ll always remember
I n’ Jay right beside me 
That’s my brother for life 
Trey and fresh3 on the track we
Cooking until we die
Y’all think it’s so simple 
But y'all don't know what I been through
Dodgin’ snakes, duckin’ strays, tryna lock jaws like them pits do 
But I'm a lion, a tiger, a bear
And I'm tryna get ahold of it yea
Tryna set a spark
In world that is dark
So they never forget I was here
Yeah

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that you think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice fore you speak
Here to take the crown and I mean by any means (my shit go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that u think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice for you speak

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
White bottom God made boots
Waterproof front grey sweater 
Not in competition for the chicken 
Kissin’ no bragging I'm just way better 
Feather wherever oxy I'm extra sneezin’
Might bless ya, screeching go get em’ 
Workin’ 2 hittas, meant to say burners 
Cookin’ 4 burners, talkin' 'bout stoves 
And when I say burners coulda meant phones comin' back silent 
Lookin' like burgers
Babe you look nervous 
Tell me what's wrong 
Might look chaotic 
Under control 
Start to whip silent keep us controlled
Garbage can dealers gettin’ disposed
Louie V emblem really got boring 
Bow-legged stripper, ripper, she snoring 
Say I'm too cold
Talk I ignore it 
If I'm not hustling you unemployed
I don't get tired energy drink
500 m's nigga you know it
Richer than your favorite rapper won't show it
I ain't really gotta trap keep going
Greedy bout eatin’
Really enjoyed, addicted 
I'm focused niggs keep goin'

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that you think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice fore you speak
Here to take the crown and I mean by any means (my shit go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that u think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice for you speak

[Verse 4: Trevor Jackson]
It’s funny how my feelings in yo speakers 
And yea i got the baddest know you see her
I'm hard hitter I go I go hard with it
I work all year 
Losing ain’t an option
Rae Sremmurd on me oh how I do it
I ain’t got no type I love makin’ the music
The same but I just grew some
I've come to the conclusion 
That everyday's a game of spades 
To win you gotta lose some
Been awhile the beast was in the booth 
Time to let it loose 
So anybody on your pedestal 
You can tell ‘em to move

[Hook: Trevor Jackson]
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that you think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice fore you speak
Here to take the crown and I mean by any means (my shit go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street
Name another that u think go harder than me (watch me go)
Bang, bang, bang, bang, now think twice for you speak

[Outro: Trevor Jackson]
Here to take the crown and I mean
Here to take the crown and if you try to stop me
Bang, bang, bang, bang, it go hard in the street 
Your boyfriend’s lame, he ain’t retarded like me
There go Gates he do his bank with his B
Finer thang go let ‘em hang over me
