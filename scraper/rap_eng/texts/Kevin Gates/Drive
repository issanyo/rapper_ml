[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Never made love outside in a car
Eat dick, while I twist a cigar
You a lady in the streets
Don't know what you mean to me
And a queen to a king, Yes you are
But every time you're around me, baby
Make love, I drive you crazy
Ride smooth like a Mercedes
And I fuck you like the bitch that you are

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Come here boo give me kiss
Taste your own pussy got to get it off my lip
Spit it in your mouth
Then ya spit it on my dick
Six nine, six nine, we be wobbling the headboard
'Bout to put it in your life, what you scared of?
Bend ya to the floor, they no running from a nigga
Lick all in ya booty, got you runnin' from the lizard
I got diamonds on my Momma
Like the middle of December
First time I made it this cold
I had to feel your body shiver
Hate to be around too many
I don't really like to kick it
Could of fuck with other women
Baby you ain't really feel it
When you tell me that you want it
And a nigga don't deliver
Hit 'em with some jugg
I know you feel it in your kidney
Leave the crib to make a play and bae
I know you really miss it
Pull up to the trap I got a meet my brother, Menace
Stupid nigga out of line
I put his feelings on the ceiling
(Aye!)

Make love, I drive you crazy
Ride smooth like a Mercedes
And I fuck you like the bitch that you are

[Verse 2: OG Boobie Black]
I'm a O.G you can say that shit (What's that?!)
Bitch I been knew you was a trick (Bitch!)
Never did hate, get that cake (Get it!)
Suck a nigga dick, look him in the face
I don't give a fuck 'bout broke ass hoes (Fuck 'em)
Real ass nigga, 'bout my dough (Ya!)
If a bitch wanna chase, let her get up in the race
All my niggas still runnin' in the race (Uh, Ah!)
Slapped in the face, Bitch obey
None of you bitches ain't winning this race
Trust no hoe, bitch call your brother
Bet you had dick he a dead motherfucker
Stupid ass hoes, trying to get a look
Love the backseat, trying to keep it in the hood
Eat that dick up puh so good (Damnn!)
She know what it is, and the bitch understood

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Moment of silence
Soldier Slim, watching bitch
You better not say a word
Slap on her ass three times, for the thirty
Cut up in the kitchen, steal digits phone kick it
Still getting to the business, went to knocking over birds
Don’t keep the back arch
Getting on a nigga nerve
Squealing, squirming, I know what to do
You ain't pay attention when I told you not to move
Let me get my keys, I'm a fuck you in the coupe
In the backyard sales still coming through
I don’t get tired, where you going I ain't through
I'm a make you get on top
And ride it while I'm driving
I'm a hit the gas, all you gotta do is guide me
Eye contact ho, let me know you got me
Rest in peace Joe, yeah young nigga wilding
Rest in peace Joe, yeah young nigga wilding
