[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
If you fresh then we all like
They say I'm hard to like
Walking round Louis down
Downtown Harlem nice
They say I think I'm all letting you women be on me
Black on black, stacks
This comes from dealing with junkies
Gave the streets the news (realest in the city)
Rap game in the like the crack game
My deal with an addiction
Hold it down for the millions and the millions who convicted
Dealing with sentences
I ain't talking about no English class
Throw the book at you shit
I'm talking like an English class
I'm in the kings clean the same spots on my shirt
All base, fish scales
Same spots on the work
Same block on the curb
Same watch on the slurb
Same drop let the trunk bang with the bang cock
Girl coming cray she's tryna try to fray straight from Bangkok
Pour the bag of pills
I throw everybody back
Kevin Gates getting played up in everybody trap

[Hook]
I don't know about you but we get money over here
Money over here, we get money over here
Fresh off release had to stack change on you pussies
Nuts hang, let my chain swing on you pussies [x2]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I yawn at Gates still safe like the vacon shit
Fuck coners, deposit lump sums like the bank n shit
You in the repossession? We in the takin' shit
Fuck your fingers, niggas up in Nina's tryna break ya shit
Stupid how the kid get freaky
I want a pinky ring
Don't be in the streets you don't even know what freaky mean
I'm on this evening thing, significant others
I just get them in covers then I
Stick them and shove them while I
Piss in the rubber then I
Pitch in the gutter
Call her back, money short a stack
Hate to call her that
Hoover suction vacuum cleaner like where the carpet at?
Waterberry retawdid
All we do is feel long with hair
Then we baptise let them gargle
Where the toilet at?
Go against the audience we send them where my father at
I'm a G nigga
Hell Mary flee flicker
What's up with Bone? Get him on the phone
I got some lean nigga

[Hook]
I don't know about you but we get money over here
Money over here, we get money over here
Fresh off release had to stack change on you pussies
Nuts hang, let my chain swing on you pussies [x2]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
50 Grand in jury, make a nigga want to rob me
Thing click sing switch needle in my i.v
People in the lobby, detectives all around me
Went against my game being stupid out my boundaries
Keep a drum in the south
Why you running your mouth?
Pussy motherfuckers know what's up they don't come in the south
Slide out the misle
You guys got to feel them
Hook up on them pies
Taken rise out the denim
Don't respect money
After that what happenin'?
I ain't ever rat, other cats say they won't rat again
Gas come out the jackets all the racket get retracted
Goin' to jail been played out
Bracelets in the shackles
Did that when we was in juveniles
New niggas be acting
Cuts in your eyebrow ready to wile out
Get snuck in the club for yelling your side out
It go bam-chicka-bam go live in the clouds mouth

[Hook]
I don't know about you but we get money over here
Money over here, we get money over here
Fresh off release had to stack change on you pussies
Nuts hang, let my chain swing on you pussies [x2]
