[Intro]
Chakra realignment, the way I be kickin' that lingo
Meditation, I’m in order now, I'm unlike regular people
I faced a lot then I settled down, the way I be kickin' that lingo
Got ’em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
High intensity discharge, I got a better medallion
I'm ’bout to give her the dragon
I’m 'bout to give her the dragon
Glowin’ on 'em, Bruce Leroy
I got a fetish for fashion
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin’ I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo

[Verse 1]
Red Porsche lookin' like a crab, I'ma go cop a Sebastian
Bitch brain game through the dash
Musta been takin' some classes
She's a swallower, got a scholarship, I wonder where she got her Master's
Houston we got a problem, I need space, intergalactic
I'm 'bout to open a wrapper, I meant to say open a package
I'm 'bout to read me a brick, I meant to say book
Promise I will not slip again
Continental, no Michelin, well it's only there when I'm in the Benz
I'm bein' hated by many men, get rich or die like I'm 50 Cent
Remember when life was the simplest, back when I didn't have fifty cent
Sober now, I'm takin' Yoga classes
I'm a great example, great sex haver
In-shape for the Met Gala, come in Kim Kardashian
Dick in your back, now look back at it

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
High intensity discharge, I got a better medallion
I'm 'bout to give her the dragon
I'm 'bout to give her the dragon
Blowin' on 'em, Bruce Leroy
I got a fetti for fashion
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo

[Verse 2]
Vibe, I'ma roll a fly way in a driveway at double R
Voice activation at the start, push button, I ain't gotta park
Really talkin' 'bout California, New York, I ain't got a car
I'm beyond, so the Altamar nonchalantly coolin' by your broad
Hard, how much it cost? You gotta ask, you not someone I should be around
Valet gonna offer me orange juice, when in Paris I'm shoppin', at Leganow
Fashion jacket got iron swagger, rockin' a magazine with a Rod
Tobacco leaf, Ecuador
Mind your business, not gettin' bored
Soft touch, close, slammin' the door on some shit that I know that you can't afford
We 'bout to eat on the bed but I tend to sleep more comfortable on the floor
For keepin' it real, never won awards
If you wanna meet, it may be yours
If you wanna meet, it may be yours
If you wanna meet, it may be yours

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
I'm 'bout to Enter the Dragon
High intensity discharge, I got a better medallion
I'm 'bout to give her the dragon
I'm 'bout to give her the dragon
Blowin' on 'em, Bruce Leroy
I got a fetti for fashion
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo
Be around me, know you want to
I'm unlike regular people
Got 'em thinkin' I know Kung Fu the way I be kickin' that lingo
