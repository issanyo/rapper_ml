She don't wanna make love
She just want me to come over and stroke her
And she don't wanna make love
So I gotta bend her over and stroke her

I understand you got a man, and I'm a dog
Dick like a half a brick, I just dropped it off
Turn your song on, Turn your phone off
Leave your heels on, Take your thong off
Kiss you knee caps, Spread your ass checks
Can't 69 all the time, Girl you're nasty
(Yeaaah) I'm touchin all on your kitty
Get on top I let you ride, While I'm sucking all on your tittys
You're boyfriends a lame so I'm about to fuck your brains out
Say my name, Go ahead and let it rang out
Love the way my ding-a-ling-a-ling hangs out
Let me do thing I let my ding-a-ling hang out

She don't wanna make love
She just want me to come over and stroke her
And she don't wanna make love
So I gotta bend her over and stroke her

We in the the mirror (Whatcha mean)
You my bad bitch
Up and down on the counter
I attack it, while I stab it, then I grab it
In the back of her mind I know she thinkin' what'll happen
Under a spell, I mean it must be magic for me (For me)
Jumpin out tha shower, with my towel on
I'm enjoying this I wanna see you with out the towel on
Double cup styrofoam, imma taste the
Gimme a kiss, lick ya lips, you don't taste the lean? (Taste the lean)
That's when she told booty-hole, booty-hole
I put it in her booty-hole

She don't wanna make love
She just want me to come over and stroke her
And she don't wanna make love
So I gotta bend her over and stroke her
