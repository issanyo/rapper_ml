Bitch you something so serious
It's recording?
(They say diamonds are forever)
(They say diamonds are forever)

[Verse 1:]
Public thought me a pessimist think my thoughts too pessimistic
Reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am and two-seated
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to God, somebody pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins, just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate but feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys, who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop you jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't meet ya momma but I told her I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too personal, lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens them idiots must don't love life

[Hook]
Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint
While under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off, loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright
Cookin' soft and selling hard while under neon lights

[Verse 2]
Bread Winner Mafia ? we poppin' in climates with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink then it's what I believe
Exploring desires this moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her "D"
She, grippin' the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now while inside of it hollerin louder she get it with speed
This is we. They say diamonds are forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal girl)
Cling on got the theme song on my ringtone I'mma beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan that I'll have you scared better tell em I'll catch em I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July bout that
And they say diamonds are forever (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal)
From start to finish go ? sayin life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, go now start ya engine
On a 90-day run we thought was different
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings but a understanding
