[Verse 1]
Overseas mixtape tourin'
You was probably thinkin' bout me durin'
Quran with me, thumbin' through the Surahs
In need of moisture, wouldn't give you urine
Rest in peace Puerto Rican J
Yo no me canso, what the fuck he say?
Fat Marquito, who the fuck are they?
With her mother, probably where she stay
Fat, black, nasty, who your baby daddy?
Sure as hell ain't Puerto Rican Gates
Name in my ear, real 'til you squeal
You no longer solid, on some gangster shit
Hoe get out your feelings
All on Instagram
Internet beef, lil' dirty stinky bitch
Hate I mean this with all my heart when I tell you
Fuck your mama, I just bought a whip
On you pussy where you niggas gotta sit
Sayin' pussy cause you sure ain't gotta dick
Born Breadwinner, fuck that other shit
I-I believe in a sky, a higher power
Shots fired by your favorite rapper
Partner - boom boom boom - God got my body
God time to shine, I'm not satisfied
Lucas on the line, shut up hoe be quiet
Hoes wanna fuck Breadwinner Ron
Come on say you don't, hoe you know you lyin'
Pretty motherfucker, jokers say I'm ugly
Where your real hair?  Hoe you know you byin'
Uncle be blowin' up a nigga phone now
Uh uh nigga, come on keep it where you kept it
Took a lot of Ls, I became a veteran
Over set-backs, I be steady steppin'

(Surah Al-Fatiha)
Bismillaah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem
Al hamdu lillaahi rabbil ‘alameen
Ar-Rahman ar-Raheem Maaliki yaumid Deen (yeah)
Iyyaaka na’abudu wa iyyaaka nasta’een
Ihdinas siraatal mustaqeem
Siraatal ladheena an ‘amta’ alaihim
Ghairil maghduubi’ alaihim waladaaleen
Ah sha la do Allah
E la ha il Allah
Washa do Muhammad
Du la surah Allah
Allahu Akbar

[Verse 2]
Double duck city, tooly rang movin'
Out the chain gang, 40 with the drum
Same nigga in your party goin' dumb
Diamonds in my mouth, I don't let it run
Rihanna wanna suck a real nigga dick
Really goin' down, not in no DM
Partner wonder why she won't let it slip
He don't keep it real, hit him on the flip
Meet me 'round the corner, burn him with the sticks
Why he got the biz?
He know what he did
Ain't no love when the winners really win
Peddle drugs in a rental, spin your wheels
Junkie name bought a spot, I pay the bills
Cocaine residue up under fingernails
All on top the table and on every scale
Pop scrips for me, I want every pill
Winter cold summer, never know the feel
Sirens pull up, we already know the drill
Whoop the charge, but we couldn't beat the ride
Schemin' on me, see the look in people eyes
She a demon, while she speakin' I'ma slide
Nigga winkin' I ain't even much surprise
Common Projects on my feet, I need to drive
[?] I caught a close to twenty-five
Five years ago, when I was twenty-five
Twenty-five, facin' twenty-five to life
Receivin' in, wasn't even read my rights
A bitch who want some money, she can take a hike
Me, myself, and I took my own advice
Breadwinner films, built an enterprise
Down to shoot some shit, depend on which device
Going in alone, rappers tellin' lies
Keep it platinum, never change, homie
Heard they 'posed to got some change on you
You go platinum, family change on you
Mouth is platinum, spout some change on them
I never stress on 'em touchin' me
Think 'bout it 'fore you run up on me
Some will say'll say that they don't fuck with me
Probably cause they cannot fuck with me

(Surah al-Fatiha)
Bismillaah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem
Al hamdu lillaahi rabbil ‘alameen
Ar-Rahman ar-Raheem Maaliki yaumid Deen (yeah)
Iyyaaka na’abudu wa iyyaaka nasta’een
Ihdinas siraatal mustaqeem
Siraatal ladheena an ‘amta’ alaihim
Ghairil maghduubi’ alaihim waladaaleen
Ah sha la do Allah
E la ha il Allah
Washa do Muhammad
