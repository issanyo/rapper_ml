[Intro]
Man there ain't no sense in playin' with these niggas man
Go in there and give 'em the business, flush him out
And we gon' turn up in this bitch tonight, hard for
Luca Brasi nigga

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, it's him your won't see tonight
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Bridge]
Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Interlude]
Girl, but Kevin it's like you here but you ain't here though
Gates, what the fuck you mean I'm not here? I'm right here
Girl, you lookin' at me like you want another bitch to jump at my face
Gates, well maybe I do

[Verse 1]
Talkin' work on my phone nigga say he got them bricks
Scored a few by the two, or the ten, that's a lick
And my momma know I'm gutter and she also know I'm strapped
And she know I killed the key and Keith, ain't try to murder back
She know you take a shot at me, I'ma send like 30 back
Christina and Alicia, they both keep my dirty gat
Comprehend you talkin' reckless while we on my cellular
Life is too depressin' to be stressin' on the regular

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, you won't see the night
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Bridge]
Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Verse 2]
I wanna stop hustlin', I wanna change over
Right now a nigga aim on that Range Rover
God forgive for the brains I done blowed away
Put that on my unborn child and my throwaway
Commitment shy, I'm afraid of bein' involved
Shawty tell me she love me, I don't tell her I love her back
Niggas in the hood, I go see 'em when I can
I got niggas in jail, I go and see 'em in the can

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, you won't see the night
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Bridge]
Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
