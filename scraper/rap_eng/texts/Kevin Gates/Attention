[Verse 1]
Walk without an entourage in which I won't discuss
Killers in New York in the clink, they know enough
My celly spit in the sink, one blink, I'm sheddin' blood
If we was in the street, one squeeze would wet him up
Acceptin' no disrespect, wait, who am I to budge?
Quarter million dollar mouth, who am I? The plug?
Nothin' that can save you, your life is now above
I wouldn't even give a fuck if you and I were blood
No one lent their helpin' hand, got it out the mud
Rappers in the industry see me and give me hugs
Then they gossip with their partners in private, I've seen it done
Fat boy you a bitch, you know how I come
MAC 11 rangin', slangin', cuddles with the drum
Keep my name out your fuckin' mouth, endin' off your tongue
Double 0, 17, my BGs sellin' drugs
Drought 'round Hollygrove, key need me to flood

[Chorus]
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Please don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Goin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'
A gangsta, all this pain, it get rough
No retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt
And I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways
I ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days

[Verse 2]
King Leonidas at his finest, no witness so who assaulted you?
Talk to God, go to war, think, consult with the oracle
Kevin Gates' face front page in the article
Lawyer paid, dismissed the whole case, they'll slaughter you
Run and I observe, ain't no sense in bein' audible
Quarterback call the audibles, switch the play on the blitz
Harlem at the Rucker, dick suckers watchin' the kid
Rust color Timbs with a gun up under my gear
Thump through the slums and slump me somethin' forreal
Cut off one of your fingers and puncture one of your ribs
Youngin' really thuggin', guerilla hustlin' for real
Body tatted, DJ Drama, that gangsta shit in my grill
Lay loose with a Llama or stank a bitch if he squeal
Set outside the store that my gangsta bitch just went in
At the pharmacy poppin' 'scripts, my prescriptions is gettin' filled
I love her, took her name and encrypted it in my ear

[Chorus]
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Please don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Goin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'
A gangsta, all this pain, it get rough
No retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt
And I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways
I ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days

[Verse 3]
Appreciate the help that's been comin' on nothin' will I depend
When asked about the pen, if I'm goin' back that depends
Faucet water brought me to places to say I ventured
Older I can cope with soda, pull off in the grey Avenger
I want her, she pushin' kids in the stroller, who? For her sister
The purchase skirts with some purses but couldn't flirt with her friendship
Jewels, DVD, Raheem murdered by Bishop
Paid in full, no disappearance, dealers be switchin'
[?] clip rich then snitch, tellin' the business
I see this every day, deceit, failure to mention
Ten toes deep, want my money on fleek
Section 8 voucher and public housin', we livin'
Mama callin' Meals on Wheels, they won't deliver
Came up quick in the trenches when we was little
Call a pizza man and rob him when they deliver
I should write a book entitled, I Promise I Really Did It

[Chorus]
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Please don't be alarmed, for the money I'm impatient
Attention, you are in the presence of a gangsta
Goin' hard or you starve, I don't see no sense in waitin'
A gangsta, all this pain, it get rough
No retreat, we don't sleep, when it's beef we gon' hunt
And I'm lookin' for some niggas with some bitch ways
I ain't shit, shaved or bathed in like six days
