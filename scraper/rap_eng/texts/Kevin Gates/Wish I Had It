[Intro]
Anything lost, can be found again, except for time wasted
A vision without action is merely a dream
It's the action, it's the grind, it's the hustle, it's the persistence

[Verse 1]
In the car while roaming around
All my thoughts been roaming around
Where I come from like a hole in the ground
Silly me still holdin' it down
Every car pass by with the music on loud while bumpin' Roaming Around
Tellin' me to make a hit but I really don't get why they walked on Roaming Around

[Hook]
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (Retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (Retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle
Clock is ticking
Ain't' no time to kick it
Nothing comes from sleeping, but I’m dreaming on my true religion
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Gotta get it
On my true religion
Nothing comes from sleeping but a dream
(I'm 100it with it)

[Verse 2]
Light skin and I fight good just like Muhammad Ali
Jab nasty, hook good, just like Muhammad Ali (Rollin' bands, in my pants, talkin' cash, I'mma smash) Hol' up
Out the streets, stay in the streets all I can do is be me
With Flo Rida, nothing in common, I'm not a B.o.B
Hustle hard and I'm hands on
I'm a good guy that could transform
Did time I ain't ask for
Still sendin' mail through the hatch form
Different city within the city
More overcrowded than a ant farm
L-l-l-look, don't try this at home

[Hook]
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle
Clock is ticking
Ain't' no time to kick it
Nothing comes from sleeping, but I’m dreaming on my true religion
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Gotta get it
On my true religion
Nothing come from sleepin', but I'm dreamin'
I'm 100it with it

[Verse 3]
I be loaded, thinkin' of condos (Gizzle, what)
Product of a broken home
P-p-pray but I just hope that I don't ch-ch-choke what I'm smokin' on
Potent, ocean-grown, no cologne I just roll
Two-time convicted felon, dumb shit, get at me
Yeah it's Luca Brasi right here talkin' bitch you know I got them racks
I'mma shooter, with a shooter, I ain't never pay for that (Shout-Out)
Young Money wanna sign me (Shout-Out), my rap jacket too violent (What's that?)
Bread Winner, 100it Gang, that's Dreco and Mazi

[Hook]
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Out my window
I see everything I dream about and wish I had it (retawdid, I'm retawdid)
Hustle, Hustle, Hustle
Clock is ticking
Ain't' no time to kick it
Nothing comes from sleeping, but I’m dreaming on my true religion
Hustle, hustle, hustle
Gotta get it
On my true religion
Nothing come from sleepin', but I'm dreamin'
I'm 100it with it
