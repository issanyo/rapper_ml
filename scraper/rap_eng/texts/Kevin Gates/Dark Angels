[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Where we go from here, if I leave the block
A little money fine but I need a lot
Take a preachers route but dont lie to people
I ain't never seen anything in the sky
Clean in the ride, what I mean that I'm fly
With a bitch super mean, bumpin' lean to the side
I was thinkin bout any means I could try
I believe in a high!
Being logical gave me a reason to doubt
Scheme for things I was dreaming
In a magazine article reading about
Face card, I ain't got to pay for drugs
It comes free with the artificial love
Could I just do me, let me be me
I ain't arguin' for much
I'm with this bitch and I feel free
She don't demand of me for much
My sex drive been at an all time low
I can barley get it up!
Tryin' to keep another mother fucker happy
Swear I'm givin' up!
Drug usage is increasing since the last time
Been gone awhile and I'll be back just like the last time
Racks on me, stacks on me, travel hard
One nation under God!
In the car alone, prayin' to the stars
Engine roaring, make a joyful noise
Praise be to Allah, come this far or not!
Cocaine, Foreign car, look who takin' off!
Throwin' money at my nigga
Younger sister really wishin' he was with us
But look who takin' off!
Band for you to keep, love I'm finna leave
So I guess I'm taking off!
Good hearted if you think wrong
How could you be right?
Four niggas fuckin' the same bitch
She pop up pregnant this can't be life
Get rid of the bitch, 'fore I get rid of you bitch
I'm sick of you bitch
No hands on ya, rubberbands on ya, I ain't talkin' like a stripper
Pay! They do it, send razors through, spray the kay and make you flip
Only reason I ain't kill your mother
Strength of her daughter
And she cheats everyday on your daddy
Tryin' to give orders
Then they try to extort a gangsta, I'm someone important
Don't step in my office, I ain't about no talkin'
Be sippin' my coffee while bullets is sparkin'
Without any caution, now watch who I'm crossin'
Boobie is awesome, can't jump if I lost ya
With this I went off
My grandpa a gangsta, he died I went off
Don't interrupt me while I am recordin'
Shit so depressing, I wish I could pause it
Misunderstand it, put that in a coffin'
Back to the margin, re-up and get off it
Label an orphan, lane of my own
I got the hawkin, I am retarded
Know there's a name, don't know what to call it

[Verse 2: Trae]
Yeah
Its like sometimes when I sit by myself
I honestly can say everybody can't relate
That's why I talk to my angel
I'm in the dark looking for a peace of mind
I need guidance Father can't see the signs
Like nothing real the word redefined
Knowing the game is different streets redesigned
Still thuggin but dont wanna catch a piece of time
Knowing that love might get you when its lookin for shine
So many young niggas lost they vision is blind
Now I'm sick as fuck got pain beatin me down
Swear a nigga sick of losing where the fuck is the wind at
I gotta fight harder where the fuck is my wind at
Lookin at the road, damn where the fuck is the end at
All I know is be the truth swear nobody will bend that
All I know is loyalty I don't know how to pretend that
You did a nigga dirty how the fuck I'ma amend that
You said you was alone so I stepped to the plate
When shit got hard for me ain't no help get sent back
Bet, everything that go up come down
Word to everyone one of my niggas that was gunned down
At night I talk to God, ain't get back one sound
Its hard to see light comin out when the sun down
Runnin, I dont even know where I'm headed
I did it all for the streets all I got was the credit
If I can go back I'll tell my nigga to edit
Until im runnin out of time get the clock then set it
Sluts lust hopin they might trap shit
All cause I rap, now I hate this rap shit
Laws comin ain't no time to react shit
Judge wanna convict me I ain't even much clap shit
Born sinner cause I was lookin for dinner
Tryin to feed my kids tell em daddy a soldier
Lord knows I need em kind hard to function
Gettin sick of the devil that bitch ridin my shoulder
Fresh out my luck somethin short of a clover
Stress recycle shit over and over
Fuck the world these days shit colder
Friends fake but all I want is to get older
Feelin the pressure like everyone watching
The bell keep on ringing like somethin that boxin
My son havin seizures no doctor can stop em
Hold on to him with all i got I can't drop him
My spirit been broke I pray somebody swap him
My heart feelin pain like if somebody shot him
My brother keep callin I tell him I got him
And since nothin promised I'm goin without em
My aunty just died I can't cry I just kissed her
Short of my visit they told me I missed her
Look up to God hopin heaven can list her
Somewhere in his kingdom with both of my sisters
So in my zone nigga fuck if I'm trippin
My testimony somethin niggas should listen
Been 32 years but I'm still on that mission
The struggle got a nigga hooked like I'm fishing...
