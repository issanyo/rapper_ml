[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Nigga I think I'm talkin' 'bout a bitch
Squat made the beat
I bought a brick from Gustavo's
I'm lookin' out for debacles
Go Grizz
I bought a crib in Morocco

[Chorus]
You shoulda just let me have you
I could've made you so happy
But I don't do second chances
Everything, man what happened?
Forever I wish you happiness
Never do this again
But I fell in love wit' a dancer

[Post Chorus]
I don't wanna be without your love tonight
Whenever I'm with you it feels like paradise
Mix a few mistakes with wrongs and rights
When you listen to your heart it gives you sound advice

[Verse 1]
I'm that nigga you want
I'm that nigga you love
When you met me, you knew I was a plug
You know I was your drug
Not bein' mannish
Hope you not bashful
Can I just grab a handful of ass?
And not to harass you
Had to just ask you
Kiss on your panties
Lick on your panther
Bowlegged stance, I love how you standin'
I love how you starin' at a nigga
Embarrassin' a little
I'm a little shy, I had to admit it
I'm a little fly, I had to admit it
Just went viral on my Insta
Where I'm likin' all your pictures
Yellow gold like I'm Muammar Gaddafi on these niggas

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Pull up in my new Tahoe
Bought a brick from Gustavo
Lookin' out for debacles
Free my nigga Muhammad you know we visit in Cabo
Flip the money and made a ki', bought a crib in Morocco

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
You shoulda just let me have you
I could've made you so happy
But I don't do second chances
Everything man, what happened?
Forever I wish you happiness
Never do this again
But I fell in love with a dancer

[Post Chorus: Kevin Gates]
I don't wanna be without your love tonight
Whenever I'm with you it feels like paradise
Mix a few mistakes with wrongs and rights
When you listen to your heart it gives you sound advice

[Verse 2]
Takin' them trips, meet at the port, you know I will
Thuggin' a sport, you know I'm real
Don't gotta rep, you know I kill
I don't eat pork and I don't squeal
Fly you out, sit down and chill
Beat that pussy from behind, bitch, bend over, you know I drill
Your lil' dude too insecure, why he worried about the kid?
Why he speaking on my name? Don't he know I get it in
You want smoke? Then it'll get there, pronto
Fix your attitude
Say lil' bitch, just keep it G wit' me, that's all I ask of you
That's all I ask of you

[Pre Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Pull up in my new Tahoe
Bought a brick from Gustavo
Lookin' out for debacles
Free my nigga Muhammad you know we visit in Cabo
Flip the money and made a ki', bought a crib in Morocco

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
You shoulda just let me have you
I could've made you so happy
But I don't do second chances
Everything man, what happened?
Forever I wish you happiness
Never do this again
But I fell in love with a dancer

[Post Chorus: Kevin Gates]
I don't wanna be without your love tonight
Whenever I'm with you it feels like paradise
Mix a few mistakes with wrongs and rights
When you listen to your heart it gives you sound advice
