[Chorus] Emanuele Rigido

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumping I’m ring, ring, ringing
Counting money while they ring, ring, ringing
Trap jumping I’m ring, ring, ringing
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumping I’m ring, ring, ringing
Counting money while they ring, ring, ringing
Trap jumping I’m ring, ring, ringing

[Verse 1] Insanis

Rappin with the anger that I got in my soul
Every disgrace cuts me open, bleeding in a bowl
Yea I get it that I got no feelings, but I have a goal
You may touch my chest, but you will think you're in the north pole
If there's no help I will make it on my own
And the ones who want to see me fail are crying back
Accusing me I'm not myself, but I know they are the clones
I keep real to myself, I'm the best on every track
Look at the people, controlled, they are so feeble
We gotta live our lives, cause this is not a sequel
Licking the booty, but it's yours, you're a beagle
Looking at you from above, you don't know that I'm an eagle
Every statue destroyed erases our history
A part of me dies and that shouldn't be a mystery
I'm a sinner, but I got a saint in the inner me
Maybe death isn't so bad when you live in misery

[Chorus]

[Verse 2] Insanis

Gimme the mic so I'mma set it on fire
Nobody can touch it 'cause I am a liar
'Cause what I sing, I drink, is always dire
And when they admire, forever they call me sire
Gonna fuck you up so beat it, I will never be defeated
I hate the way I was treated, I will never be depleted
I want a punani army on me
'Cause I will never be a philosopher like Gandhi
I turn up, motherfuckers look silly
Confused like the sheep chased in the big city
Acquainted with the vocabulary, I got no limits
The brain works so well, forging good music in minutes
You don't know me, but you found me in the parking
Staring at the phone, and you know I am the lost king
Bitches sucking on my dick, you know they be barfing
If you can do it better than me, then you can come sing

[Chorus]
