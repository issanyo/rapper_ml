[Pre-Intro: from The Godfather]
"Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to this personal service contract, with a big bandleader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. Now Johnny is my father's Godson, and my father went to see this bandleader. And he offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went to see him, only this time with Luca Brasi."

[Intro: Kevin Gates]
I don't know when I have to come in Gus, you gonna have to signal me
Throw them fours up there
They gonna love that, the children of my section gonna love that

[Verse 1]
Broke bread in the trenches, ligaments incoherent
Luca Brasi Story, skid is itching to hear it
Bread Winner go fly, no kites on me
Got white on me, catching crack sales all night, homie
Got a smoker system with a pipe on it
Got a digital scale, critical well
Niggas watching for the Bread team
Morning steak with the baked beans
9-milli holding 18
Ed Sheeran, A Team, customers awaiting
Fuck around with this shit
No prison sentence, escaping
Everyday, I'm praying, best friends don't betray me
Young guy, really pussy, a gangster he's portraying
Mad cause he ain't me, your girl fucking with Muk-Muk
Left jail, back to the kitchen, like Martha Stewart, no cookbook
My daddy made me look good, but that's not no good look
White jet screeching off, in a vault, my speakers bought
In Zion City on fourth street, strapped by the crotch, Coursey
Of course we know ?, but her life is boring
Pouring promethazine in a one liter of Mountain Dew
Fountain of youth, I've just discovered
Uncovering who I really was
In the game, I am aggressive
I'm even handed, meaning ambidextrous
Can of ?, while your ?
No short-taking round here
I'm a street nigga, got beef with ya
Touch everything in your family
My baby momma big booty bitch, her grandmother can't stand it
My pants on but they sagging, fuck who can't understand it
?, my BG understand it
Somewhere on the corner, possibly on the summer
Caught a whiff of aromas, absorbing most of the odor
Bitch I'm cold I'm a soldier
Remote control for the moment
They tuning in to Gates gas station, Boost Mobile phoning
? platinum patroners, making them have convulsions
Look who taking office, Kevin Gates while in office
Used to have a brain, unfortunately I lost it
I know it's got a name, but don't know what I could call it
Retawdid

[Outro]
On TV screens, thugging hard won't need no green
Smoking ? gonna bring me cheese
Bad bitch, and she on her knees
Talking 'bout she won't do this thing
All I know is ?
I blow the brains out
