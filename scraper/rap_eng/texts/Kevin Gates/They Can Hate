[Chorus]
We gon talk about the policy
Imma break the game down
And give it to you logically
A nigga get gettin' money now
Fuck it they can hate
Big blunts and purple shit
Fuck it they can hate
Ice fillin' up a nigga chain
Fuck it they can hate
Rock rims that’s on everything
Fuck it they can hate
Kevin Gates - they can hate
Dead Game - they can hate
Won’t change in the game
Stack change - they can hate

[Verse 1]
Back where I started from
Back where it started from
Kept a poker face
That’s what promoted Gates
Getto Lanisha in the beamer
With the stolen plates
Gather the audience
Of people, I'mma blow the state
Ain’t no controlling Gates
Life like a video
Flights with the white mode
Nights than Arsenio
Do it for the money
Don’t wanna be livin' famous
Ghostwrite for niggas
That wanna be entertainers
645 honeybee coupe
Come with a yellow stick
550 see thru top Gates for President
Demand what they tellin' me
Handle the legacy
Morris Brown Maserati tanned
With the leather seats
Timberlands peanut butter wheat
Rockin leather trees
They like let em eat
Gates don’t let 'em breathe
Ain’t shit ahead of me
That won’t let him sleep
I’m like AIDS a disease
Won’t ever leave

[Chorus]
We gon talk about the policy
Imma break the game down
And give it to you logically
A nigga get gettin' money now
Fuck it they can hate
Big blunts and purple shit
Fuck it they can hate
Ice fillin' up a nigga chain
Fuck it they can hate
Rock rims that’s on everything
Fuck it they can hate
Kevin Gates - they can hate
Dead Game - they can hate
Won’t change in the game
Stack change - they can hate

[Verse 2]
Rastaman real ting
This get in the way
Some got away
Some got shot in the face
Other rappers fake
Don’t want get it in with Gates
Get em on a track
Now you’re dealin' with an Ape
Now you dealin' with a great
It’s to make it all basic
Different with his business
Bourne Ultimatum
Eatin' niggas up
Born occupation
In a suite she a Japanese
Foreign operation
Do it in the mirror
On the floor or by the basement
Label me the truth
You will never get remembered
You a fan you was in a band
Better when assembled
Alleviate fear leave out nothin
Lean on the couch up and be
House fuckin
Now I’m like get the cash
Maneuver the Bentley tag
Dog having puppies
In the closet on a Fendi bag
Michael Vick shit
Nigga pissed how real is that

[Chorus]
We gon talk about the policy
Imma break the game down
And give it to you logically
A nigga get gettin' money now
Fuck it they can hate
Big blunts and purple shit
Fuck it they can hate
Ice fillin' up a nigga chain
Fuck it they can hate
Rock rims that’s on everything
Fuck it they can hate
Kevin Gates - they can hate
Dead Game - they can hate
Won’t change in the game
Stack change - they can hate

[Verse 3]
Look - styrofoam white cup
Got a lot of ice
And for a bezel around my watch
Got a lot of ice
I just go in and cop
I don’t look at not a price
Man it’s some shit I do a lot
This is not advice
Not a nigga, not a bitch
In this world that I ever bow down to
Gotta hunnid guns gotta hunnid clips
In this bitch nigga, we’ll blao blao you
Okay, I’m reloaded
You need to know this
And it’s BR if you got it
You better tote it
I - I - I - I’m Gucci my nigga
And I need me a buyer
If you need you a dealer
You know I’m a guerilla
Trying to say I’m reckless
Like Thriller
Niggas sick but I’m iller
Niggas real but I’m realer
Got to find me a pill of
Some of the light blue painkiller
Got my bitch in this bitch
Her booty soft as a pillow
All I know is get it
All I know is get it
Never take a break
It’s ya Minelli
DGYSE - they can hate

[Chorus]
We gon talk about the policy
Imma break the game down
And give it to you logically
A nigga get gettin' money now
Fuck it they can hate
Big blunts and purple shit
Fuck it they can hate
Ice fillin' up a nigga chain
Fuck it they can hate
Rock rims that’s on everything
Fuck it they can hate
Kevin Gates - they can hate
Dead Game - they can hate
Won’t change in the game
Stack change - they can hate
