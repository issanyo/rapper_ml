[Chorus]
I can't even trust my heat, 'cause sometimes that bitch jams
And everybody that I meet swear that they gon' hold it down
And every bitch I thought I loved took my heart and went crash
And every time I was away, she had dealings with the past
That's exactly why
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho

[Verse]
Millimeter time, three stripe Adidas time
Believe in God, I just beat a crime
What I'm doin', I won't feed a dime
Mindin' my business in my leisure time
Heart cold, this time I'm keepin' mine
Keepin' mine, ayo, keepin' mine
Exotic, fine, sexy creature
Chocolate Easter Bunny, it ain't Easter time
Fiji water, sip it like your wine
See sativa, he just holla...
Kevin Gates, all the way up
Like it's money just to hit a line
Flashback, take it back a while
Bitch tellin' me to get a job
Now she askin' can she have a job
Askin' that to someone who enjoyed
Workin' for myself, I'm unemployed
Never fire, actin' with a rod
Big dog status on the yard
Bought a car to practice in a car
They grabbin' shit, my back against the wall
I love you, never had to get involved
Pull it off in traffic if I get the call
I just wanna ball, I said don't we all?

[Chorus]
I can't even trust my heat, 'cause sometimes that bitch jams
And everybody that I meet swear that they gon' hold it down
And every bitch I thought I loved took my heart and went crash
And every time I was away, she had dealings with the past
That's exactly why
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
I ain't trustin' no, no, no, no, no ho
