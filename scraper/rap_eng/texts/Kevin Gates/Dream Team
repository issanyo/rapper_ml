[VERSE 1: Kevin Gates]
This came from under the overpass
Of being passive
We don’t believe in asking
See it indeed we snatching
The ? harrassin

Meanwhile I’ve been focusing
Sit back and I’m noticing
This dope in what I’m posed to get
Casino full of poker chips

Well the birds don’t chirp
But they really do flirt
And they all wanna get close to him

Cash on deck
Imma stack my check
Till my pocket fat like Oprah
Here’s my bitch she sick
She Oprah thick

Cruising in my Louie
All the groupies on my Gucci loafers
Cutie with a booty hold up

Wait a minute I’m supposed to ask
You ain’t just see the Rover pass
Really don’t mean to boast and brag
But I possess the coldest swag

Other chick got a donkey ass
Shopping spree no folding tags
Yo women come back misused and abused
My women come back with grocery bags

Life is only as lonely as
A person make it so I made it
New Mercedes two vacations
Bought a plane and flew to Vegas

I’m in a jacuzzi bathing
Smoking on some silver haze
While chilling with a few Jamaicans
He insane I must be crazy

[Chorus]
Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea

Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea

[VERSE 2: Kevin Gates]
I got some good jook
I slang iguana dick
All that eaten and late night fucking
I’m the one who got ? bit

Tyra, Antoineesha, One, Sierra, and Yolanda and them
Couple of women in colleges
Prefer not to acknowledge em

Help em with they modelin
If they bout some gargling
Head to get ahead if you good with head
Then you gotta swallow it

Woodwork like a carpenter
Retarded I’m just marvelous
While wheeling and dealing for bargains
So I’m similar to an auctioner

Keep secrets don’t believe
In no leeching
The missile is heat seeking
Vehicle has heated seats

Treated seams candid
A Cutlass check the inside of it
96 Impalas, suede, ostrich and koala prints
Used to be obnoxious
Then them hoes starting jocking it

Now I’m on my grind
Pop my collar rottweiler shit
Up in VIP don’t bring the glass
Send us the bottle bitch
Robert Cavalli stitch
Find me on some finer shit

[Chorus]
Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea

Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea

[VERSE 3: Malachi]
On the Interstate 10 - I’m H-Town bound
My Spanish bitch expecting me
With her ass in the air - and her face straight down
I’ll take that bitch to ecstasy

Gotta little plug - with a keys and a pound
But the dope I slang - come out my mouth
Never lay your head - where you keep your bread
Just took about a hundred three out my house

Out my socks out my drawers
Out my mind out my top
Ain’t can’t fit tired of rubbing

Gotta kick one of these hoes out my drop

Out of every album that I done drop
Which one you like the most and shit
Got so ? to my name
But I don’t mean to boast and shit

Just doing me - don’t have to try
That shit come natural
Their game like the dream team
Travis and ? they take me national

Pimp em in the club - and I pop 20 bottles
Man I’m not thinking rational
? stuff for about 20 models
Man I’m just trying to smash you know

No panoramic view from my grandmama house
Off the porch
Millioniare scheme
With a Panamera dream
Young nigga fin to go pop Porsche

With the windows jet black
So them hoes don’t notice me
We gotta be called the dream team
Cause we make more hits than Jodeci

[Chorus]
Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea

Dead Game like a dream team nigga
And more doe and we about to get richer
More shows more doe more liquor
Dead Game like a dream team nigga yea
