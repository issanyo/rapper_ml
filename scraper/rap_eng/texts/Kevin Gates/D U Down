[Intro]
What you say your name is?
This your first time bein' here, you know around me, yeah?
Look
Man I want the fuck out you
Like nah

[Chorus]
Dick you down, dick you down
Dick you down, dick you down
Every time you call
Pick you up, bring you 'round
I'ma beat it up, he don't do you
Like I do, ooohhh

[Verse 1]
Ran off on the plug, I was touching her to Plies
Country fine she obliged
I was givin' a massage
Big fine like her mama
She smile, then I got her
Then I got her out her body
That little pussy got some power
Know she tryna be a model
Dancin' while she was in college
Bartender at the spot, and yeah
That pussy got some power
Lickin' on her, go to kissin' on her
For a long, long, long time
I wanna go another round with you, baby
Only if you don't mind
Had you on the four wheeler
You was excited, nibble on you, Tyson
Smackin' on it while I grip it from the back
Actin' like you don't like it
I go hard in the bed
I be pullin' on her hair
Diamonds glistenin' all up in your face
Now stick that ass in the air

[Chorus]
Dick you down, dick you down
Dick you down, dick you down
Every time you call
Pick you up, bring you 'round
I'ma beat it up, he don't do you
Like I do, ooohhh
Dick you down, dick you down
Dick you down, dick you down
Every time you call
Pick you up, bring you 'round
I'ma beat it up, he don't do you
Like I do, ooohhh

[Verse 2]
In here layin' in my chest
Teeth twinkle in the dark
She asleep and I'm awake
And I'm reminiscin' in my thoughts
She my baby, she a boss
I might go buy her a car
I just wanna see her floss
She like real she awesome
Can't take a lot, she go to talkin'
And I don't really do no talkin'
We had met out while out in Houston
South-by while out in Austin
I be fuckin her to my lil' brother
Bam music, you know I'm retarded
I'm a bread winner, yeah
But you can call me Kevin
She be callin' me Marcellus
Throw it back, I bout to catch it
Ain't no fallin', I'ma catch you
If you callin', come and best you
Super nice to your lil' sister kids
You know all of them my nephews
She be laughin' at me, she be crackin' up
Told her pink is where I met you

[Chorus]
Dick you down, dick you down
Dick you down, dick you down
Every time you call
Pick you up, bring you 'round
I'ma beat it up, he don't do you
Like I do, ooohhh
Dick you down, dick you down
Dick you down, dick you down
Every time you call
Pick you up, bring you 'round
I'ma beat it up, he don't do you
Like I do, ooohhh
