I’ve been betrayed and never lost
Fuck it I can get it on my own
Niggas getting caught up on the phone
I know how to weather through the storms
I could grind and get the money long
Long go get it I could leave it alone
I go to jail today I’m left alone
The plug love me I knew you long gone
Niggas will run with me to say they hung with me
They not one hunnin
Broke and we didn’t have nothing to eat
But found some way and we got with a real nigga

Remember when we was young
And fighting over crumbs
Now we control the slums
40 with the drums
(40 with the drums)

[Verse 1]
I remember when we was just
We were trying to see some shit
While niggas were on some beefing shit
I was busy trying to be some shit
Stay up trying to tell myself but
Boy now you straight boy, I’m going to leave this shit
Told my momma I’m about to drop with gates
She can’t believe this shit
A lot of niggas played me on the low, I had to eat some shit
Lost Key be my label, told my brother we gone eat with this
Play me a nigga gone bleed for this
It’s coming and I seen this shit
Went from catching them buses to them foreigns
Ain’t no keys in this
All I know is keep it real, Ain’t never been in no fake shit
I done been in the back before, ain’t never been on no hate shit
Lord knows I been broke before, so now we make that paper flip
Use to be on my dick, now me and the plug got a relationship
I swear to godddd

I’ve been betrayed and never lost
Fuck it I can get it on my own
Niggas getting caught up on the phone
I know how to work through the storms
I could grind and get the money long
Long go get it I could leave it alone
I go to jail and damn left it alone
The plug love me I knew you long gone
Niggas what to run with me to say they run with me
They not one hunnin
Broke and we didn’t have nothing to eat
But found some way and we got with a real nigga

Remember when we was young
And fighting over crumbs
Now we control the slums
40 with the drums
(40 with the drums)

[Verse 2]
Beg the lord forgive me
Killing came with ghetto vision
I know the angels with me I’m not one for superstition

BWA
Hard to name a nigga flyer now
Your bitch just fell in love with the neighborhood supplier now
No more beans no more ice, brainstorming on the flight
Not the flight that caught my wings in in the trenches selling white
I’m not focus on your women you could keep her she ain’t right
Bread Winner Ron grab the money count it lick it right
Take the pain away
Dog food in syringes
Take the pain away
Don’t believe still here
I’m so rich I’m going away
Don’t believe the snitchin
Your bitch just fell in love
But I'm fresh out of trust

I’ve been betrayed and never lost
Fuck it I can get it on my own
Niggas getting caught up on the phone

Long go get it I could leave it alone

The plug love me I knew you long gone
Niggas what to run with me to say they run with me
They not one hunnin
Broke and we didn’t have nothing to eat
But found some way and we got with a real nigga

Remember when we was young
And fighting over crumbs
