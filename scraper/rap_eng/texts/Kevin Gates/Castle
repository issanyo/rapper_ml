[Produced by The Hipaholics]

[Intro]
Don't say his name and make him famous
Pelican fly
Fuck it make him pay you
Operator, attention operator, I got
(Hipaholics, baby)
If someone's gettin' impatient, I just
Told Donald Trump think about if you came from rubble
Would you be so quick to judge?
Or would you be more quick to love?

[Hook]
Step in the castle, we on an island
Breadwinner castle, we goin' live
Step in the castle where the pelicans fly
You get out of line we turn this bitch to fourth of July
In the castle, breadwinner castle
Step in the castle, we on an island
The breadwinner castle, breadwinner castle
The breadwinner castle
Look who disrespected, you gon' regret it

[Verse 1]
She go to work as a porn star
I go to work when the phone call
Got an apartment and foreign car
She can take orders when I'm in charge
Free all my niggas behind the wall
Pray you get out, wanna see you ball
Now that I'm makin' it through the struggle
Haters be waitin' to see me fumble
I'm rock and solid, I never crumble
I'm like a Marley, I'm blowin' ganja
I took the route when I'm in the jungle
Ceremony, yea the bongo
Niggas thuggin' in the Congo
You know I go where they won't go
No I'm not doin' the kung-fu
In the kitchen mixin' gumbo
Fuckin' for a two piece, hit him with a combo
Nigga I go where the gun go
Fuck it we can rumble
Keep it movin' when I stumble
Elephant trunk in the front, Dumbo
Pussy niggas mumble
Run up if you wanna, you get Mutombo'd

[Hook]
Step in the castle, we on an island
Breadwinner castle, we goin' live
Step in the castle where the pelicans fly
You get out of line we turn this bitch to fourth of July
In the castle, breadwinner castle
Step in the castle, we on an island
The breadwinner castle, breadwinner castle
The breadwinner castle
Look who disrespected, you gon' regret it

[Verse 2]
She go to work as a porn star
I go to work when the phone call
I could dress up like a painter
Banger up under my overalls
Talk to your bitch, them annoyin' calls
Put her to sleep, she be snorin' hard
Pussy won't wrestle (?)
Moment of silence for Owen Hart
Mirror image of Richard Pryor and Robin Williams
Made me a funeral, meant to kill him
Rockin' it hard without water whippin'
Standin' up tall when I'm in the kitchen
I'm a pimp boss player
I'ma talk to you later
I got five cellphones and a new Navigator
Got a bad bitch waitin', Italian or Caucasian
She be snortin' tarter in the water on vacation
Got a sad bitch hatin', now the broke bitch persuade her
Talkin' bad about a gangster but she know her ooh-ooh stank it up

[Hook]
Step in the castle, we on an island
Breadwinner castle, we goin' live
Step in the castle where the pelicans fly
You get out of line we turn this bitch to fourth of July
In the castle, breadwinner castle
Step in the castle, we on an island
The breadwinner castle, breadwinner castle
The breadwinner castle
Look who disrespected, you gon' regret it

[Outro]
She go to work as a porn star
I go to work when the phone call
She got my back like it's dry wall
Chopper on deck like a foul hawk
Walkin' around with a firearm
Playin'? I'm droppin' them shells off
I got a Mac-11, disrespectin' you'll regret it
