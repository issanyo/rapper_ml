[Verse 1]
I'm often judged for the way that I look at life
Truth in the good book but don't know if I'm lookin' right
Had a couple of dollars, blew it on sprung ladies
Up in the slum pumpin' a woman, say 'waam' baby
Lord of the ring, keep ring up in the pocket
Used to order new ki's for the ring, the 'Ds" knocked it
I watched it, drop in the water get grimey
You not a artist, you just stopped and restarted the timer
I'm in the bottom, I just hopped in a car wit' a timer
It's not a problem, when I spot 'em the shit could get violent
I got a chopper, it go 'rrrah-kah-kah, brrrah-kah-kah, rrrah-kah'
You want some mo' bitch?
Come here- 'brrrah-kah-kah, rrrah-ka-' -the driver
Posted bail, got a drain in tha' account
I ain't 'posed to be in jail, I'm maintainin' in tha' drought
I lie and tell my girl that I'm'ma change when I get out
I'm right back with them hoes, just the same when I get out
Gates

[Chorus]
I wish somebody could rescue me
But there's just no helpin' me
By any means, I'm'ma stay alive
Seekin' relief from the other side
They say the drugs don't make it right
But they ease my troubled mind
It's the only Life I Know
It's the only Life I Know, 'oh-woah'

[Verse 2]
The only thing I know is 'cock it and bang, bust'
The can leave your face red, like a paint brush
Gates- Niggas is crooked, they blast fiendin'
Act street; but shit, I'm good in tha' bushes, I blast heaters
Seen it lead to mo' fast feet then a track meetin'
Ass-eater, blow a hole through your nose and your back region
I ask people and ain't receive advice at all
The 'gat', bleach 'em, and after that we wipe it off
Automatic clip in the hand of the MAC squeezer
Frequently misled, mo' creeps then a bad preacher
Not a street nigga, then the 'hood won't back 'em
You just a brussel sprout, I'm a full grown cabbage
Could talk cheddar, when I should talk lettuce
Got a room full of food, and I'm good off extra
Live savage, only in worse matters
Struggle in the jungle, and nothin' but work matters
Gates-

[Chorus]
I wish somebody could rescue me
But there's just no helpin' me
By any means, I'm'ma stay alive
Seekin' relief from the other side
They say the drugs don't make it right
But they ease my troubled mind
It's the only Life I Know
It's the only Life I Know, 'oh-woah'
