[Verse 1]
Fuck the rap game, I wanna get it like G
Put me on the block, go to thuggin' like E
Think I'm goin' back but free my nigga Lump
Me and Gunna, 9th innin', just beat a life sentence
Anyone of you lil' boys on the yard, throw the coffee in your face
While your wife stick a knife in your kidney
Bitch I'm goin' crazy, going out gangsta
9 milli's slangin', Telly Hankton
MAC-11 rangin', jumpin' out, walkin' up on blocks
40-50 shots, I'mma clean a nigga clock
Everybody gettin' rocked when we hop out
Pussy better not cry now
Nigga where we from it's the code that we live or we die by
Grrrrrat, nigga, bye bye
No police up in the business when you get the shot and miss it
50 niggas from New Orleans come and terrorize the city

[Hook]
Aaaah, what's happenin'? Don't panic, don't panic
'Bout to... get 'em dead, don't panic, don't panic
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout a jewel  nigga showed off
Couldn't use your brain, now you gotta get 'em blowed out
Dog, get a call, everything for the scram
Don't panic, don't panic
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine

[Verse 2]
Team strong as a bitch, layin' low down, low down
Everything feel the business, lay 'em all down
Auto manslaughter but you never thought it out
Curse, kill 'em all, let the lord sort 'em out
F&N point short, let the spark haul 'em out
This what war 'bout, nigga, fuck that
Meek men is Gunna and Boobie, we already died twice
God in my heart when I gave back life
I was coolin', I was tryna live a laid back life
Now my kids gotta see me in the pen or the grave
Real street nigga, no pen to the page
And I will beef with you anywhere, any place
Lil' ugly ass bitch better fall back
Keep my name out your mouth or get your hard hat
Brasi the enforcer, I meant to say the landlord
Better yet, let me let them rubber bands talk

[Hook]
Aaaah, what's happenin'? Don't panic, don't panic
'Bout to... get 'em dead, don't panic, don't panic
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout a jewel  nigga showed off
Couldn't use your brain, now you gotta get 'em blowed out
Dog, get a call, everything for the scram
Don't panic, don't panic
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine

[Verse 3]
I don't mind doin' time, I'ma doin' time vet
Hustle in the jailhouse, Bread wanna bet?
BWA, this is not BMF
Everything around me convicted already
Pull my clique together, built it from the inside
Penitentiary rules in effect
You lil' boys go to jail but you don't know how to fight?
Ain't no guns back here, don't know how to make a knife?
Stand tall on my own, I don't gang bang
I done seen it go bad on the chain gang
Seen niggas gang raped by their own gang members
Cliquin' up with other gangs and they kill their own nigga
Seen a nigga on a visit huggin' on his wife
Get back to the cell, he another nigga wife
Everyone that say salamu alaykum ain't your brother
Come to my respect, I'mma die over nothing

[Hook]
Aaaah, what's happenin'? Don't panic, don't panic
'Bout to... get 'em dead, don't panic, don't panic
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout a jewel  nigga showed off
Couldn't use your brain, now you gotta get 'em blowed out
Dog, get a call, everything for the scram
Don't panic, don't panic
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine
Fuck bein' friendly, nigga say what's on your mind
Naw I'm bein' quiet, I got murder on mine
I got murder on mine, I got murder on mine
Defending what I love, I got murder on mine
