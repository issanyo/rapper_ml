[Chorus: Berner & Kevin Gates]
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, it's a light show
All these hoods up in the warehouse, it's a light show
When them guns spark, and it's dark out, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All these lights around the crib, yeah, that's just the way we live
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me

[Verse 1: Berner]
Yeah, hundred and fifty grand on me, I'm guaped out (guaped out)
I couldn't pay attention in school, I'm glad I dropped out (dropped out)
I be ridin' 'round all paranoid when the cops out
I keep a forty in the dash and the craziest stash
Yeah, my jewelry drip, and my phone clickin', I'm tripped out
I shipped out a hundred fifty more then we dipped out, we dipped out
No bank account, I keep the cash in a big house, in a big house
See the V.V.S.s in the crazy necklace, with the brown bag I been gettin' reckless
I been hood rich, big box and all that
Two black bags, I'mma buy up all that
Bust-Down glowin', look like a light show
The stone in my ear look like a light bulb
In '03 I was O.T., with the O.G., tryna be low-key (yeah)
New crib in Hawaii, blue and red lightin', no cop behind me

[Chorus: Berner & Kevin Gates]
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, it's a light show
All these hoods up in the warehouse, it's a light show
When them guns sparks, and it's dark out, it's a light show
All these lights around the crib, yeah, that's just the way we live
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
You see the stars up in the whip, yeah that's just the way we live
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All these hoods up in the warehouse, it's a light show (it's a light show)
When them guns spark, and it's dark out, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Foreign whip with my foot on the gas
Fish tailin, I was showin' my ass
Smoking some shit, you consider it grass
Exons still consider it gas
Chick on the side of me startin' to spazz
Slow it down, bae you goin' too fast
Ching-boaw, I'm behind all that ass
She Armenian, she come from Baku
No sleepin' alone, I'm sleepin' with you
Half of the time, that ass on my mind
She back in town from Majisa Bhajan
Red bottom, Christian Louboutin
Tell Berner, he gon' come with a ton
Brick player, I'mma pray with a don
Off-White, not the regular ones
Cook dope while she thumbin' through funds
She legal so she clutchin' the gun
Hit jail, I'mma need her to run
Hit the stash spot and come with a trunk
Jump bail, run it up in the clutch
Earring, vroom, Formula One
Diamonds divin', they performing a jump
Teeth hittin' and they glisten too much
Limoncello gettin' stuffed in a blunt

[Chorus: Berner & Kevin Gates]
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, it's a light show
All these hoods up, in the warehouse, it's a light show
When them guns sparks, and it's dark out, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All these lights around the crib, yeah, that's just the way we live
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show
(It's a light show, it's a light show, it's a light show)
You see the stars up in the whip, yeah, that's just the way we live
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All these hoods up in the warehouse, it's a light show (it's a light show)
When them guns spark, and it's dark out, it's a light show (it's a light show)
All this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me, this jewelry on me
