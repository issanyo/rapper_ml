Shawty look good but her friend look better
Wish I would have known that
Before I even met her
We could blow strong when we kickin' it together
Late night in the whip, talkin' bout whatever
I could keep a secret but we gotta be careful
I could keep a secret but we gotta be careful
Whip it from the rear while I nibble on her ear
What we doin' here maybe sure no one ever hear

[Verse 1-Kevin Gates]
Louis Vuitton Aviator frames, you know?
People like us takin' off, Pluto
Body inked up, keep starin' she fucked
Remove her panties with my teeth pussy eat up
Grind hard, time behind bars, never ease up
Vagina they should keep it clean I'm a beat up
Have her naked cookin' breakfast while I kick my feet up
Bout to go to work no need to roll the sleeves up
Rollin' out the red carpet while I roll my trees up
College girl questionin' my cup, what's the pink stuff?
Turn her to a fiend, taste the Lean, baby drink up
Doin' every freaky thing she could think of

[Verse 2-Kevin Gates]
Branded, twerk that girl like Kev Hamill
White automobile lookin' like teeth enamel
Randall, down to the art but it's a gamble
Gun and ammo quarterback if you ain't understandin'
She don't want me givin' dick away a double standard
Hate to be romantic, rather be man-handled
Hands behind her back, tied her up with a bandana
Pullin' Strings as I made her sing Carlos Santana
Bitch wit' ass, that's a BWA banner
2 ounces of Lean in a 20 ounce fanta
Dick make her feel it in her stomach when I rammed her
I kill pussy, made her out an example
