[Hook]
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it
Not to be cocky but they do it all tryna win
Middle finger right up, big smile on my face
I don't get impressed by too much
I'm gon' keep it real, keep it real
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it

[Verse 1]
150 dollars for a haircut
Remember bein' broke and I ain't had much
Fresh kicks, no whip, hard to add up
Got on my grind, I'm afraid of havin' bad luck
Balenciaga, Margielas
Bread winners set a world record
I took my team to the 'chip
Bought us all some new whips, to the death you forever fly
Think what you want, we in the sky
Boarded a plane in Hawaii
I'm not endorsing getting high
Seem like when I'm stressin', it gets me by
New coupe, matte black, peanut butter guts
Porsche truck, BM, she the runner up
You ain't gotta say a thing when you live your dreams
Crack a smile, mess around, blind everything

[Hook]
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it
Not to be cocky but they do it all tryna win
Middle finger right up, big smile on my face
I don't get impressed by too much
I'm gon' keep it real, keep it real
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it

[Verse 2]
I could never let 'em turn my momma lights off
Do whatever to survive, need it right now
We the ones pretty girls used to turn down
Now I got a nigga sweatin' all up in her mouth
And they jumpin' through a hoop, doin' backflips
And they say they get aroused by my accent
Interstate, go and get it, comin' back with it
Booty club, cuttin' up, throwin' racks in it
Throw it back, get it
In the club turnin' up, throw it back get it, get it, get it
Throw, throw, throw, throw it back, get it
Told my sister we okay, what you worried bout?
Kevin Gates, I'm the one you prolly heard about
Get a couple years, bounce back from the pen
I'd do it all again for my kids, they the world now
They the world now
Did a couple years, bounce back from the pen
I'd do it all again for my kids, they the world now
They the world now
I say I'm turnt up in this bitch fly right now
And I don't know how to turn down

[Hook]
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it
Not to be cocky but they do it all tryna win
Middle finger right up, big smile on my face
I don't get impressed by too much
I'm gon' keep it real, keep it real
I love it, I love it, I love it
I swear that I love it

[Verse 3]
Emotions on my sleeve, I can't even lie
Copin' with depression, I don't even try
Not to mention bad dealings with some women
Tend to get all in my feelin's, even contemplated suicide
Deep secret, keep it in-between you and I
Late night text message, baby you reply
You ain't sleep yet? Baby I don't get tired
You would have thought I was a snorter and I hit a line
You would have thought I was a snorter and I hit a line

[Outro]
