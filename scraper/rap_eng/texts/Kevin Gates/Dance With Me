Intro:
Won't you please x2
I'd really love to x2

Yeah, yeah. Won't you
Dance with me x2

Verse 1:
Another night, another club at a different place
The party's bumping, I'm really loving this pace
Time to have some fun
Partying with everyone
Maybe dance with someone

Out of the corner of my eye, I spot a cutie
Red dress, lipstick, heels she a beauty
My eyes locked in the notion
Get ready girl, I'm approaching
Hope to get you in motion

Chorus:
The party ain't over, why you standing over there
Do you need a partner cause we'd make a great pair. Won't you
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me

Cause girl you're looking so fine to be standing there alone
You should come out on the floor, put down your phone and
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me

Verse 2:
A night like this comes once in a lifetime
And not having fun would be a crime
So what's the issue?
Tell me what's the issue?
I just wanna groove with you

You told me that you didn't have the rhythm
When it came to music, you didn't have much wisdom
I'm like 'if that's the issue, I can teach you, baby
You'll be moving to the right beat, my lady'

Chorus:
The party ain't over, why you standing over there
Do you need a partner cause we'd make a great pair. Won't you
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me

Cause girl you're looking so fine to be standing there alone
You should come out on the floor, put down your phone and
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me

Bridge:
Just take my hand, and follow my lead
Loosen up, surrender to the beat
Yeah that right
If you keep it up
We'll go all night

Ooh, enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself for me
Let's have a good time you and me
We can tear the whole house down
All you gotta do is get on down

Chorus x2:
The party ain't over, why you standing over there
Do you need a partner cause we'd make a great pair. Won't you
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me

Cause girl you're looking so fine to be standing there alone
You should come out on the floor, put down your phone and
Dance with me x2
I really wanna dance with you
So please come dance with me
