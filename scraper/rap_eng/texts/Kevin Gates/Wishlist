[Verse 1]
Snowbird, tying ribbons up in your hair
Wishing that I could be there
Stay awake, stay aware
Cause I'll try to stay awake throughout the night
And I will chase the sun in flight
Till I'm there, I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Winter came, I was gone
Flight departures, times we've lost
Saw you standing in the snow
Such a vibrant glow

[Chorus]
Oh, did you ever think I'd come home?
I couldn't spend this night alone
'Cause you're number one on my wish list, baby
Oh, in a little bit I'll be there
Like a star shot through the air
To make a check-mark on my wish list, baby

[Verse 2]
Airplane, could you take me far away?
To the snow enveloped plains
Cause she's there, cause she's there
I fly, in a coast to coast charade
But if only for one day
I'll be there, I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Winter came, I was gone
Flight departures, times we've lost
Saw you standing in the snow
Such a vibrant glow

[Chorus]
Oh, did you ever think I'd come home?
I couldn't spend this night alone
'Cause you're number one on my wish list, baby
Oh, in a little bit I'll be there
Like a star shot through the air
To make a check-mark on my wish list, baby

I promise I'll be there
Cause you're the number one on my wish list, baby
I promise I'll be there
Cause you're the number one on my wish list, baby

[Bridge]
I've got time, twenty-four hours
Waiting for the go-ahead from the tower
If I had just one wish, get me home for Christmas
I've got time, twenty-four hours
Waiting for the go-ahead from the tower
If I had just one wish, get me home for Christmas

[Chorus]
Oh, did you ever think I'd come home?
I couldn't spend this night alone
'Cause you're number one on my wish list, baby
Oh, in a little bit I'll be there
Like a star shot through the air
To make a check-mark on my wish list, baby

I promise I'll be there
Cause you're the number one on my wish list, baby
I promise I'll be there
Cause you're the number one on my wish list, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, did you ever think I'd come home?
I couldn't spend this night alone
'Cause you're number one on my wish list, baby
Oh, in a little bit I'll be there
Like a star shot through the air
