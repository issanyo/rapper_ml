[Verse 1]
The mood is right, the feeling's up
We're here tonight and that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 2]
The party's on, the feeling's here
That only comes this time of year

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 4]
The word is out about the town
To lift a glass, oh, don't look down

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding

[Verse 4]
The party's on, the spirit's up
We're here tonight and that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 1]
The mood is right, the spirit's up
We're here tonight, oh, that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Outro]
Christmas time
