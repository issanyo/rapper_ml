Og Boobie black, camera caught the footage
Drop a quarta' thang', witness got the fully
Poppin' beam and mac, don't put on a hoodie
Ain't no tinted windows, they know I ain't pussy
I'mma' die bout it, rappers lie bout' it
In and out of jail, I ain't cry bout' it
Nigga killed my brotha', had to write bout' it
Fuck you and your mother, she could cry about ya
New designer belts, someone to respect
Breadwinner shit tatted on my neck
Still in the game, all of my connects do whatever for me
They love me to death
