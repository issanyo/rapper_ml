[Hook: AKON]

Yeah we roll in the Cadillac nigga straight loc'in
Top open everybody holding g’s
Smoking on the Cali weed
We proceed, we burning
We bang like a heart attack niggas ain’t joking
So focused, everybody hate police
Won't let a nigga roll this weed
We proceed, we burnin'..

[Verse 1: Chinx Drugz]

Call it been there, will spin it niggas all offended
You know I’m bout to rape the game like a sex offender
Gonna get it on your own no co-dependant
Before you back your throne nigga know your limit
Still burning rollin' with the top back three times felon
Forty's knock is top back
New J's on Chris Shawn going strong
Your picking stems out your shit then you know its wrong
Gone smoke out the chevy windows half cracked
This the cali love, I blow my last stack
Stealth mode with your bitch told her pass that
Before she drop it on my carpet told her ash that
We burnin, burnin

[Hook: AKON]

Yeah we roll in the Cadillac nigga straight loc'in
Top open everybody holding g’s
Smoking on the Cali weed
We proceed, we burning
We bang like a heart attack niggas ain’t joking
So focused, everybody hate police
Won't let a nigga roll this weed
We proceed, we burnin'..

[Verse 2: French Montana]

Fresh up outta court
Rolling up a dank
Diamonds in the paint
Harder than a tank
Why the fuck them niggas have it
Get up on your feet
I’ll be court side braggin'
20 for the seat
Truck up in the hood
Bitch with the sports bra
Feet up on the wood
I could flip a small car
You bald headed skank don't fuck up my high
Canarys on the gold chain will fuck up your eye
Plenty drink, plenty smoke, plenty niggas
Steady fuckin' with us, niggas choke
Naked bitches takin pictures
I'm gettin throwed weeds official
My wrist glisten, niggas broke (FUUCKED UP)
We burnin..

[Hook: AKON]

Yeah we roll in the Cadillac nigga straight loc'in
Top open everybody holding g’s
Smoking on the Cali weed
We proceed, we burning
We bang like a heart attack niggas ain’t joking
So focused, everybody hate police
Won't let a nigga roll this weed
We proceed, we burnin'..

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Im from under..of being hated
They know I’m still the greatest
I know some fakers that's faking, I call 'em imitators
I got a bitch and my mistress is still in patience
And she missing the sick dick and she sick of waiting
But i got sick of waiting
I got a zip of piff that I've been puffin lately
I feel like shit is gravey only if i make it out
And if this road lead to a dead end I'mma make a route
I got 'em all down south
They go from making money out of town
To get my own down south
Disrespect in here will get you punched in the lip
We got bricks not the back boy the front of the rim
So a lot of pricks bitches often coming with me
Spread money across the counter never question receipts
I ain’t mean to approach ya
I got my team to scope ya
They took a shop to tangle all to keep my focus
We burning..
