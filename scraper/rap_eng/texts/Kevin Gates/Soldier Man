[Intro]
Say, say Tasha say Brianna run over there and bring me my cup ya heard me
Bring me that right there
Nigga already know my swagger sit on the ceiling with hopes of grabbing a million
If rap don't happen to happen its back to bagging and pitching
How can a child heed they father when he somewhere in the pen
30 days from my release right back in the streets again

[Hook]
Prayers go to heaven, when you close your eyes
The gunshot sounds come as no surprise
When living in a soldier man town
When living in a soldier man town
No sunshine skies are grey
But we live this night and day
I Guess I'm living in a soldier man town
I Guess I'm living in a soldier man town

[Verse 1]
750 Li, dive in the streets
You learn to swallow your pride or you die tryna eat
Kevin Gates, don't know what to call it, forever me
Whatcha months like, I ain't sold grass since 17
God I know you in control of the cards and you deal em right
My dawg gave his heart to the Lord, and got hit with life
At least we still see him, not at all freedom
Family pictures without you in em, we not at all cheesing
Something about your daughter, the way she be looking at me
Give her toys, and I spoil her, she still don't be looking happy
Niggas look crooked at me, symbol of success
Bread Winners Association got the emblem on my neck
Out of town Beto and Brian we talking brick money
A8, R8 Spyder, we talking whip money
Pigeon on the strip, feet hurting, you talking trick money
Had to get a job to survive, cough up your rent money

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Lord bless me with another topic, public defender
No dream team, no Johnny Cockrin
The mothers of my children got they own specific ways
Head first in the game, keep hunger pains away
When Grandfather passed away, I heard him say you the man of the family
Never thought the Judge and the DA's would try to slam me
Now I understand that it, ain't no understanding
Money in my hand, my respect, I'm demanding
Label label me reckless safe to say a loose cannon
Fast cars, fast broads, and penitentiary chances
Broke it off they like family, big dawgs got involved
Now the kid is outstanding
Nike sweats, White G-Stock look who out standing on the block
Fiends passing, watching things harassing
Stop it, in the street I'm tryna see a profit
Can't go get a job, I ain't got no other option

[Outro]
True life confessions, expressing what I believe
Scars on the surface, with mines I can bleed
Everything I lost, eventually Ima see
Lay my life down, holding my weapon willing to squeeze
Stuck in the street life
Sucking my teeth like
Hustle to eat, while I'm, clutching my heat
Object of the game was to stack and get out of here
Shoulda never changed, so I'm trapped, can't get out of here

[Hook]
