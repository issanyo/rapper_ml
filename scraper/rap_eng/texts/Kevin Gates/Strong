[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I send this out to my soldiers up the road again
Still breathin, probably never comin home again
Lookin up to heaven askin where did we go wrong?
And tell me why forever got to be so long?
And be so strong, but we all break down
Starin through the bars down a long hallway and there's no way out
Out of sight, out of mind, got me lookin at the world like they forgot about us

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
I got some niggas down the road and they ain't comin home
I think about them everyday I'm gettin my hustle on
But talk to them every day, they got cellphones
Realness behind the wall gettin they juug on
Put yourself in my shoes you probably wouldn't survive
I thank God every day I open up my eyes
Another thanks to my lawyer I escaped a dime
Any charge I ever had I took that shit to trial
Don't get caught with that cocaine
Gotta be smart in the dope game
The world is full of snitches
I hope I never go to prison

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I send this out to my soldiers up the road again
Still breathin, probably never comin home again
Lookin up to heaven askin where did we go wrong?
And tell me why forever got to be so long?
And be so strong, but we all break down
Starin through the bars down a long hallway and there's no way out
Out of sight, out of mind, got me lookin at the world like they forgot about us
