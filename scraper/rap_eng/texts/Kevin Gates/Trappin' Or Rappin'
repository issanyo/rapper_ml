[Verse 1]
Brains on my pants, leg
I'm itching to blast
Shit stains, seeing blood got me pissin' my pants
I'm equip with a can
Serving and robbin my people
In a bottom about a dollar they holla miss equal
I seen greats disappear in this life of crime
They snatch Malcolm, kill row in this life of mine
Show a nigga love they smile and they won't move
Same shit got London, shot on the front porch
Then that nigga got Fresh and that stupid chain came
Wig, I got intendancy to shoot and range aim
The colder actors get protected, confidential
The sit downs and the talks made me conscientious
Now my times spent giggling, never mind you bitches
And if your times spent listening
Mind your business
I talk a lot about a grind
Running out of time
KEVIN GATES DEAD GAME, BOTTOM LINE
I been dealing with yay
Pushing and flipping my cake
I'm addicted to thick chicks stick dick in their face
And if I ever get the word you stealin' my babes
You order try to grow fans and live in a lake

[Hook]
This is life we don't talk about the other side
I watched families tore apart, saw mothers cry
Running faster, knowing that it don't matter
See my friends in the pen with they arms shackled
It don't happen on the wire happen in the bricks
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich
We get it on like the new indictment don't exist
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich

[Verse 2]
I thanking god he bless me got a way with words
If I don't get it out of lyrics then I'm taking yours
I sit back in my coupe
Relaxing with who?
Hard to handle I could make an example and shoot
Then your family got to make an example of you
LISTEN TO KEVIN GATES, HE SICK IN THE HEAD
He eat traits, get them then rip them to shreds
Still is different once said I love you don't mean a thing
Because everybody right around tell her heat a swing
I walk it off with a frown it hurt when I'm smirking
Tec in my shirt
Protecting my purchases
If I offended anybody I said it on purpose
Test it is worth it
It's all raw deley
When you mosquitoes get the speaking brought her off with me
Stop at campus cuts niggas got to line up
Not me, hot seat
Line with a line up

[Hook]
This is life we don't talk about the other side
I watched families tore apart, saw mothers cry
Running faster, knowing that it don't matter
See my friends in the pen with they arms shackled
It don't happen on the wire happen in the bricks
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich
We get it on like the new indictment don't exist
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be left out looking through a fence
Life on the other side looking through a fence
Watching from the tv, listening from the radio
Reminding me of (Pac or Big), he ate his prone
He wear that mask like Jason or Casey Jones
Buy and sell on the bell, send the purple
Flying shells through the 12, ninja turtles
With Michelle, ginger ale and a different circle
Make it rain, Gates
But I done blue the spot Wayne
I ain't care if yous a prostitute or not now I prostitute the block
Got her selling the goodies
Had my people see you dressed Vest and the hoodies

[Hook]
This is life we don't talk about the other side
I watched families tore apart, saw mothers cry
Running faster, knowing that it don't matter
See my friends in the pen with they arms shackled
It don't happen on the wire happen in the bricks
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich
We get it on like the new indictment don't exist
Either trapping or the rapping I'ma get us rich
