(Hook)
First class flight is leaving now
Dry your eyes
Baby, I'm way too fly to be around
Your kind
Life of the party
Every time that I'm in town
Grown, used to hardly
Fucking with the lights on

(Verse 1)
Wanted an old school Chevelle
But addicted to dash
But when you dressing bummy
Women look at you and laugh
Rock windows...
Method of catching a cab
Houston by way of Grey Hound
Catching the slabs
Triple digits without assistance
I'm fetching a pair
Designer on my bitch
And I got Dominicans fixing her hair
Shout out to my nigga
Maserati Mazi
Stand up in niggas chest
While rocking Versace
Big booty stripper
My life's complete
Foreign thang playing Rick James
"She's alright with me"
One Hunnit Gang
Put that on my name
Change on the gauge
When it bang
Blowing out your brains

(Hook)
First class flight is leaving now
Dry your eyes
Baby, I'm way too fly to be around
Your kind
Life of the party
Every time that I'm in town
Grown, used to hardly
Fucking with the lights on

(Verse 2)
Phone calls can affect
And my dawg be calling collect
Got a party offer that says
Spray the .40, off with your neck
If your daughter was disrespecting
Ain't no talking when I'm upset
Shawty want to converse
And I'm like what the fuck about?
What the fuss about?
Dick got a problem so suck it out
Do it with the lights on
No way you're stealing my jewelry
If you do, I swear to God
I'll be picking the jury
Syrup got it hard to see
Leaning, Vision is blurry
Kinda, Sorta like the shit that you consider injury
Cedric Tasco my nigga, Birdman Slim
Words can't heal
Broke heart, Blackout
No rubber, No feelings
Fucking in the trap house

(Hook)
First class flight is leaving now
Dry your eyes
Baby, I'm way too fly to be around
Your kind
Life of the party
Every time that I'm in town
Grown, used to hardly
Fucking with the lights on

(Intro)
Life of the party
Every time that I'm in town
Grown, used to hardly
Fucking with the lights on
