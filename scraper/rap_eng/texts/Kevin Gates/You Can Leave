[Intro]
Nigga run up on me with the handgun
I might could stand one
They say when love comes around
Baby you could leave
I said baby you could leave

[Hook]
They say when love comes around I probably had missed it
If this the way it is it's correct to assume I'll end up
All alone
Probably with some other guy
Ain't no needin' why
My pride won't allow me to even try
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave

[Verse 1]
This a fucked up scene, I'm mugged up mean
What the fuck you mean, this ain't over
How you change over, holla game over
You tripping hard you ain't sober
On banana boats how we came over
Designer stores, Michael Kors
No plain clothes without names on 'em
Your right wrist got my name on it
I'd be lying if I said I ain't lonely
That nigga dead we ain't homies
My pain growing that thang on me
Cocaine rover, mean range rover
Swang corners put aim on 'em
Kuh kuh and bang on 'em
Leave brains on 'em and stains on 'em
Get three grand for my main smoker
This game cold but I stayed focused
Bread winner chain on the head of the lame
He was here, but he ain't, we steady rollin'
When the cam moving blam through
No shampoo hit head and shoulders
Never been in love I ain't joking
Pass by your house on a late night
Bumping Swim Good by Frank Ocean

[Hook]
They say when love comes around I probably had missed it
If this the way it is it's correct to assume I'll end up
All alone
Probably with some other guy
Ain't no needin' why
My pride won't allow me to even try
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave

[Verse 2]
Please don't do this to me
I'm losing, I'm losing my sleep
Without you it'd be hard to smile
Like crackheads losing their teeth
Blew the national keep harassing cause you for me
Drew your name in class, professor asked, "Is this a new degree?"
Profusely in pursuit of something you reminded me of a society
Feel 'em slipping from sanity
Don't eat enough, I'm rude no longer speak as much
Frequent find the reasons niggas stepping on my sneakers
Got me steaming I should beat 'em up
Or get beat up and say somebody made ugly
You don't love me
So disgusted seeing couples coupled up in public hugging
Huffing, puffing, phone reluctant
You most likely call it stubborn
Kevin Gates mixtape motion picture
All or nothing

[Hook]
They say when love comes around I probably had missed it
If this the way it is it's correct to assume I'll end up
All alone
Probably with some other guy
Ain't no needin' why
My pride won't allow me to even try
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave
Took one in the sleeve
Without you by my side it's safe to say I'll die
But baby you can leave

[Outro]
And that's how we comin' man
All through the mixtape
Versatility retarded
Make 'em believe, that's what we doin' right now man
Turn it up, let's go
