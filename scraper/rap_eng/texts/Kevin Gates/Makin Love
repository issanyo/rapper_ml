[Intro]
I had figured it out what it be
See a nigga just do something pussy because they just won't see
They just won't see as if, you know, I'm in a real thing
Awesome awesome
Really don't even call me Kevin no more, call me awesome, call me awesome

[Verse 1]
Exit off Highland, headed to the bottom
There go them dicks, (I see em') just watch em'
Make a left on East Buchanan, pull up in a backyard on Carolina
Me and Lil Ra-Ra, we juug in the city, at night I lick on her vagina
Shakira ain't want me to fuck with Sharita, backdoor Vicky with Dewana
Trappin' a package, I wrap it, get at me
When Dominique pull up, I serve, he leave happy
Shout out to Spanky, we floodin' the drought
We on College at IHoP and Cherish can't stand me
My pants is saggin' with 'bout 30 bands
Masquerade in New Orleans when I spotted Jasmine
Cedar pull up in Atlanta with Bizzy
That's Bread Winner business, that's Boobie and Menace
They land and say "Stand up" and eat niggas' chests
RIP Reezy, uptown in my section
Fear of Allah and all praise be to God
Be my only protection whenever I'm steppin'
Callin' out to the Creator
That Aramis will come up from under whatever
In the cell I can see all the pain in his eyes
And I wish I had somethin' to tell him

[Hook]
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
Think about respectin', everything I said, I meant it
Racin' modification on the Maserati engine
Pull up on the block, my bad, I'm sorry y'all hatin'
Shittin' ordinary life, fuck all of y'all lately
Gazin' out the sunroof, wonder why she not performin'
This bitch don't wanna eat my dick, I told his ho don't bother
Pull over, kick her out the car, won't even tell her sorry
It's a long walk back to B.R. while in Georgia

[Verse 2]
Awesome, we almost home
And them niggas you fuckin' with don't do no sparkin'
Don't do no talkin', I will not ever see death
Listen carefully, nigga, I'm flawless
Illuminated by the high-power
Enlightened but walk in the darkness
Cast not your pearls to the swine, young nigga
Remembering what I had taught you
I am outweighing a truth and a lie
And I've been up 40 days on a flight
Overcooked dope with a grayish complexion
When it first hit the pot it was white
My oldest son lil' Tyler
Every time he 'round me he smilin'
And he know his daddy would turn this bitch to Afghanistan
No problem

[Hook]
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
Think about respectin', everything I said, I meant it
Racin' modification on the Maserati engine
Pull up on the block, my bad, I'm sorry y'all hatin'
Shittin' ordinary life, fuck all of y'all lately
Gazin' out the sunroof, wonder why she not performin'
This bitch don't wanna eat my dick, I told his ho don't bother
Pull over, kick her out the car, won't even tell her sorry
It's a long walk back to B.R.O. while in Georgia

[Outro]
I had really did that, nigga thought I was stuntin'
The bitch ain't want bless me, ya heard me?
I told her "Look bae, go get that out the trunk for me?"
You know, soon as she went and got it, you know
She forgot the Aston Martin had the automatic close button
SKRRRRRRT, BROOM
And it wasn't my whip, it was a rent I'ma keep it one thousand
You heard me? (Laughing)
Man you know I'm all the way out there, I don't get tired
