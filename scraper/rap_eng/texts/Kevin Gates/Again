I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again

Long hair Dreka looking like she got ass shots (Ooh!)
Doing pole-a-robics sipping lean and soda I am not
Glock nine by the stop sign bout fifty thousand in the stash spot
Pray to God we don't crash in the whip through the dash
I could tap the gas and make that ass drop

Ever wonder why your bitch look funny when the music playing
Been a gangster safe to say that I live everything I'm saying
Bend her over pull her hair and eat her pussy, lick her ass
And when we be cutting up her feet be in the ceiling fan

Hold up, let me get my roll on
Think I need another pocket just to put my phone on
H-h-h-hold on, let me get my roll on
Think I need another pocket just to put my phone on (Who there?)
Long nose, better get your donk on
Speaking with the wrong tone, that'll get you dun dun
Thinking with my dick wasn't nothing like a thong song
Looking for a two piece boom chicka boom boom

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'ma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again
I'ma pull up bens again, p-p-pull up bens again

Pants sagging bout gat blasting while rats snitching I am tatted
Lean bad got bad habits yellow bitch from Lafayette fantastic
Dead broke, got mad ad it, I'm back stacking I'm flap-jacking
Your flap rattling you fat faggot, I'm back at it in the trap trapping

I love the bens, I'm Bandcamping, I'm standing strong, you bandwagon
I'm concrete, you transparent, my dick out, your hand grabbin
No can blame us, who grab bammas, eat yo block, then rim shaggin
No hidden cameras, from the back smashing, her ass clapping, I am nasty

Road to riches, go and get it in Daytona Chargers
Took a dive from not following our first mind
I was getting in the mail through UPS
If I tell you I'ma stay away from Juliet
I'ma lying

Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again
