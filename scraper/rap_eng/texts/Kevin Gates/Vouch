[Intro]
Yes sir, I'm never standing out
I'm never standing out, oh, oh
Go Grizz
Man, this big Gates right here talkin'

[Chorus]
Watch yo' mouth, no dissin' me, you know we all saw it
You say I'm fake, that's your opinion, that's just y'all story
Just face the fact I was y'all blessin', but y'all ignored it
Your quest for fame had you distorted, not acceptin' sorry
I'm really that, the streets a vouch, the people vouch
The jail a vouch, all the niggas in the feds a vouch
We held it down while in the drought, one of my cells a vouch
I'm standing' out, when it's beef, I'm never standing' down

[Verse 1]
Stayed next door to Jermalo while in Saint John apartments
Couldn't afford the rent, we moved with grandma, more like an orphanage
The neighborhood ain't like us, say we came from New Orleans
Had some fights, I slung some iron in Baton Rouge, you recall it
Lee Lucas doing life, he left when I was 11
Had a job I did not like and started narcotic sellin'
I do it for me, I feed myself, fuck who not willin' to help me
We either die or go to jail, so what the fuck could you tell me?
Fully loaded MAC-11 when this pressure get applied
Got a brand new Glock 9 and I keep it by my side
You took the side of that lil' boy, done out of hatred, no question
Draw ya sword, get met with brute force, no second guessin' (up there)

[Chorus]
Watch yo' mouth, no dissin' me, you know we all saw it
You say I'm fake, that's your opinion, that's just y'all story
Just face the fact I was y'all blessin', but y'all ignored it
Your quest for fame had you distorted, not acceptin' sorry
I'm really that, the streets a vouch, the people vouch
The jail a vouch, all the niggas in the feds a vouch
We held it down while in the drought, one of my cells a vouch
I'm standin' out, when it's beef, I'm never standin' down

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Still honor Tommy Wraith for everything he did for me, I was loyal
Got betrayed, it came with great disapointment
I thought we was under that law but your nephew's an informant
Put the folks in my business, gotta set court appointments
Gotta suit up with lawyers, damn, this how we rockin'
They copyrighted my name and wanted 1 million dollars
The label laughed in my face, I had to pay out my pocket
Young Money closed the door and ain't nobody wanna sign me
Travis Newman looked out, we in the apartment, we grindin'
If you want 'em wholesale, just pull up and we got it
Shout out to Ms. Connie, my heart on Carolina
I put diamonds in the T-O-P and all in the bottom
I ain't never change up, let's get that understood
I'm in that 70805, they don't show love in my hood
I ain't never change up, let's get that understood
I'm in that 70805, they don't show love in my hood

[Chorus]
Watch yo' mouth, no dissin' me, you know we all saw it
You say I'm fake, that's your opinion, that's just y'all story
Just face the fact I was y'all blessin', but y'all ignored it
Your quest for fame had you distorted, not acceptin' sorry
I'm really that, the streets a vouch, the people vouch
The jail a vouch, all the niggas in the feds a vouch
We held it down while in the drought, one of my cells a vouch
I'm standin' out, when it's beef, I'm never standin' down

[Outro]
I ain't never change up, let's get that understood
I'm in that 70805, they don't show love in my hood
I ain't never change up, let's get that understood
I'm in that 70805, they don't show love in my hood
