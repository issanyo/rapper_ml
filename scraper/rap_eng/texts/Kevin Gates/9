[Intro]
Ohh, yeah, ohhh
Ohh, yeah

[Hook: Jacquees]
Girl I'ma put you on the side of me
On the side of something special, you should ride with me
I'ma ride, I got your back cause that's how riders be
I'ma ride my gun, I'ma keep you on the side of me
You can be my 9
Girl, I'ma put you on the side of me
Girl I'ma put you on the side of me
On the side of something special, you should ride with me
I'ma ride, I got your back cuz that's how riders be
I'ma ride my gun, I'ma keep you on the side of me
You can be my 9

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
When we sexin', it's X rated
Deeply compelled by the scent of your fragrance
We wrapped in the bottle, we stoppin' in Vegas
We shoppin' for lingerie, lovin' your laces
Pussy no odor, I can't even taste it
Or better yet, safe to just label it tasteless
Niggas know emotion, my phone in the matrix
They claim to be an occasional drinker
But I know what you turn into without thinkin'
Bend it back open, I (?) spank it
Head-head boy we out to eat
After went out to eat
Bae come around with me
Just shopped the shower sink
Twistin' up collard greens
Music loud, vibe with me
Stick to this broccoli, loud from the driver's seat
Lickin' my fingertips, thumbing through lots of checks
I'ma ride you by any means

I'ma ride my gun, I'ma keep you on the side of me
You can be my 9 girl, I'ma put you on the side of me
Girl I'ma put you on the side of me
On the side of something special, you should ride with me
I'ma ride, I got your back cuz that's how riders be
I'ma ride my gun, I'ma keep you on the side of me

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Let the top down, let your hair blow girl
Million dollar trips around the world
I bought your bitch so you can't find your girl
Look at my wrist, yeah, all my diamonds real
And I, bitch your baby daddy broke? I can change your life
Yeah I got a trap queen, me and hubby shootin' dice
I need you on the side of me baby like every night
This is my medicine, you know I gotta get right
When I move she move, I gotta keep her by my side
Shawty so real, she can never blow my vibe
Whole pound of the gas, I tell her roll up while we ride

[Bridge: Jacquees]
Ride, why don't you ride with me?
Why don't you ride with me?
You can be my 9, right on the side of me
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
Why don't you? (Ride with me)
