[Verse 1]
In 7th Grade, we promised that we'd never break each other's heart
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved, past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Excuse - that's just a broken heart
I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight
(Say Gates, what you doing?)
Playing songs on my invisible guitar

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

[Verse 2]
Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused
Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different, would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living
Creatures of the night - we gon be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin', labeled a demon cause I can't even die
The curse of eternity - God created me, but why?
If I turn you into I, your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe, including the Willendorf
This is art
I'm a God

[Hook]
Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

I would go to war with God...to war with God, to war with God..
