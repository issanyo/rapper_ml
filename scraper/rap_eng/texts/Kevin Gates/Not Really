(Hook)
Trust issues got me being cautious, not friendly
Niggas rollin' swishas, do I wanna hit it? Not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I'm riding solo, I be strapped with that 9 milli
I'mma make you kill me, I'mma make you kill me
Baby I'm a different type or real, I can't make you feel me
Neva disrespect me, I'mma make you kill me
Maybe to police in my city, I'm already guilty

(Verse 1)
Judicate, the housing where I'm residing is boarded up
Don't go hard, go hard, go hard, go hard in stores, at work, order up
Don't come up to talk to us for nothing, exit is for rummy(?)
Been here in the streets, I see police, they don't protect and serve
Hands on the badge of a bad one, stretch him, make him hurt
Young niggas go berserk, he's in pain, taking narcotics
Hearing sirens outside, found another body
Nobody ever give us, take it, resort to robbin'
Education in the game which came from my reviving
While on the move, bumping Future, ain't no way around it
While in School, caught up chasing loot, take a break, I doubt it
Nuts hanging to the floor, nothing else to say about it

(Hook)
Trust issues got me being cautious, not friendly
Niggas rollin' swishas, do I wanna hit it? Not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I'm riding solo, I be strapped with that 9 milli
I'mma make you kill me, I'mma make you kill me
Baby I'm a different type or real, I can't make you feel me
Neva disrespect me, I'mma make you kill me
Maybe to polices in my city, I'm already guilty


(Verse 2)
These things make it down block, Sound shots
Children make the news, small murders, that any town got
He just want some shoes, you fooled, you got around that
I don't like niggas who be talking out of turn
Solid object, gotta turn into profit, feed my pocket
Fiber optic going brr-brick-bra-brrra, my type of violence
Live a hustla, die a gangsta, why not move in silence?
I'm the original my self, can't be no carbon copy
Switch lanes they come behind me, pulling out on sideways
Now the Impalas rockin' , braid with the auto cocker
Listen to Starlito
Other rappers are fuckin' liars
100 gang, come on
Fire, fire fire, fire

(Hook)
Trust issues got me being cautious, not friendly
Niggas rollin' swishas, do I wanna hit it? Not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I'm riding solo, I be strapped with that 9 milli
I'mma make you kill me, I'mma make you kill me
Baby I'm a different type or real, I can't make you feel me
Neva disrespect me, I'mma make you kill me
Maybe to police in my city, I'm already guilty
