[Intro]
Aye, automatic, automatic

[Bridge]
Automatic, automatic, panoramic coupe
That's my girl, she like to ride panoramic too
We gazin' at the stars through this panoramic roof
We gazin' at the stars through this panoramic roof

[Hook]
Roll my weed, then
Pour my lean
Would you believe I'm blowin' up?
Gettin' 50 Gs a feature, my show price is going up
Hard to deal with this depression lately I've been throwin' up
The hoes they used to hate me, love me now
My phone been off the meter
My phone been off the meter
I don't want to talk to nobody
And don't want nobody around me
Fantasizing about me
They can wait down in the lobby
Privacy, please need my privacy
I don't want to talk to nobody

[Verse 1]
Oh, whoever thought you would lie to me
Supposed to be right here on the side of me
Countin' me out and you doubted me
Street nigga, I hit the lottery
We was supposed to be married
Pack all our bags, run away to the altar
Anyone play with my love put a dent in they shit like the strait of Gibraltar
God love his children, he's awesome
He sent me an angel who's flawless
Got shot in my mouth in '05
Knocked out my teeth, it was awful
Was rendered unconscious, I called you
4:30 AM, you recall it?
Now that's just a thing of the past
We in the Lennox and turned up retarded

[Hook]
Roll my weed, then
Pour my lean
Would you believe I'm blowin' up?
Gettin' 50 Gs a feature, my show price is going up
Hard to deal with this depression lately I've been throwin' up
The hoes they used to hate me, love me now
My phone been off the meter
My phone been off the meter
I don't want to talk to nobody
And want nobody around me
Fantasizing about me
They can wait down in the lobby
Privacy, please leave my privacy
I don't want to talk to nobody

[Bridge 2]
We trying to run the money up there like way, way high
We trying to run the money up there like way, way high
You know what time it is
Niggas in they feelings on my timeline
Pay them no mind again
Out my mind
Don’t know what time I’ll be arriving
But I’m alone

[Verse 2]
No one alive could do your body like I do
Got a plug from out of town and we've been making major moves
I know Vyron Carter, the real Vyron Carter
Actin' like you don't believe me
Pull out my phone, I could call her
Breadwinner, never change
We the strongest label in the game
Cocaine paint on the Range
And it's money over everything
A couple niggas switched on me Lord
But I'ma still stay the same
Rolling round, I'ma row it down, boulevard mail in the paint

[Hook]
Roll my weed, then
Pour my lean
Would you believe I'm blowin' up?
Gettin' 50 Gs a feature, my show price is going up
Hard to deal with this depression lately I've been throwin' up
The hoes they used to hate me, love me now
My phone been off the meter
My phone been off the meter
I don't want to talk to nobody
And want nobody around me
Fantasizing about me
They can wait down in the lobby
Privacy, please leave my privacy
I don't want to talk to nobody

[Bridge]
Panoramic coupe
That's my girlfriend she like to ride panoramic too
We gazin' at the stars through this panoramic roof
We gazin' at the stars through this panoramic roof

[Outro]
Ohh she like to ride remove panoramic coupe
Ohh she like to ride remove panoramic coupe
