[Hook-Starlito and Don Trip]
I got a bitch, that got a bitch
I'm tryna quit, downed a brick
Count this shit, it might be counterfeit
Tryna stretch it, before we run out of it (yeah)
Yeah that's how it gets (Stepbrothers)
My lil homie had a scholarship, but he got shot and shit
About a bitch, ain't that bout a bitch (ain't that bout a bitch)
But nigga I got locked up with, gon probably snitch (ain't that bout a bitch)
I Swear a nigga going through a lot of shit, I just can't snap out of it

[Verse 1-Starlito]
I go to sleep on it (on it), and wake up focus (Lito)
What the fuck is up with all these Hollywood locals
And why these main stream niggas wanna copy my vocals?
Be another sad story, he got shot for some hoe shit (ahh)
Pop up at the show, we done popped the promoter (haha)
Right after we pull off, cops probably show up
Old lady stop me, while I was shoppin at Kroger
Said waitin on my new tape (Lito) she already got all the old shit
Its on the way, Oh Shit, just finishin a to go shit
Hatin niggas hatin, we didn't mean to keep ya waitin
I am just an 80s baby that these streets raised crazy
You try to interfere with that check, might as well pistol play us

[Chours-Starlito and Don Trip]
I got a bitch, that got a bitch
I'm tryna quit, downed a brick
Count this shit, it might be counterfeit
Tryna stretch it, before we run out of it (yeah)
Yeah that's how it gets (Stepbrothers)
My lil homie had a scholarship, but he got shot and shit
About a bitch, ain't that bout a bitch (ain't that bout a bitch)
But nigga I got locked up with, gon probably snitch (ain't that bout a bitch)
I Swear a nigga going through a lot of shit, I just can't snap out of it
(Gates-Lito this shit for real, true story)
(Get em Gates)

[Verse 2 -Kevin Gates]
Cold hearted, don't do favors
Ain't no love really felt for me
These cards that was dealt to me
Fake friends, they don't care for me
Pockets empty, not one name in my phone even lend help to me
Bad feeling, this baby I just had its not my own
If I don't send money, Until the work come back then fuck it
I'm not wrong, she say she sorry, that get old
Son so invited you to path, but what for
Bout that time that I get that doe, always on the road
That get rough, get that check, run it up
Face with problem after problem, just work hard, and don't give up (don't give up)
Fell off, flat broke, heard 'I ain't shit' bout a hunnid times
Laughed at, talked about, suck it up, no cryin
Stack my money till it hurt
Made them all respect my grind

[Chours-Starlito and Don Trip]
I got a bitch, that got a bitch
I'm tryna quit, downed a brick
Count this shit, it might be counterfeit
Tryna stretch it, before we run out of it (yeah)
Yeah that's how it gets (Stepbrothers)
My lil homie had a scholarship, but he got shot and shit
About a bitch, ain't that bout a bitch (ain't that bout a bitch)
But nigga I got locked up with, gon probably snitch (ain't that bout a bitch)

[Verse 3-Starlito]
I hit my point in the back door, Deuce Deuce, Lil Jo (Lito)
He caught it though, man you niggas hoes
Glad you wasn't my charge partner, you would've told
Stress got a young nigga lookin old
We all crooked, I bought it after they took it
I'm out the hood hoe, niggas still call my phone
Lookin for that good dro, and I got just what they lookin for
For the ? though
If you want that love ticket, its gon be pretendo (Lito)
You know what it feel like? Paying rent for all of your kin folk
If I wouldn't ain't grind so motherfucking hard, believe me I woulda been broke
Riding through the hood, what they hidden for
Money on my head, got a hit on me so I don't give a fuck
I done been hit before
This niggas don't want no money, but they go to war over a lil hoe
