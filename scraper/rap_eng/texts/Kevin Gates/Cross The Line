[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I hate when she away from me
In the middle of the night
Fantasize function of the mind
Paranormal activity it happen all the time
I been goin' unnoticed i can bribe by the grain
Seen you suggestin' the plan from a intellectual stand
Make you all gas 'em ride in the flexin' my hand, but now
No feelings far we kill 'em off
Afraid of a relationship we never tryina get involve
If you can't text boy take a lick and brush it off
You ain't gotta leave the things you never give a fuck at all
Throwin' like wow thing we're tall
Fuckin' till the sun comes up and then some war we been doin' all again

[Hook: T'melle]
Every time you cross the line you got me feelin' like, you got me feelin' like
Its amazing, like you got me
[?]

[Verse 2: T'melle]
When i'm happy, its like i'm in heaven
When i'm angry its like i'm movin' in hell
You wrapped your arms around me cause you tryna calm my nerve
And kissin' on my neck but this time it ain't gon' work
And i'm higgin up my skirt and your boxer wouldn't work
You been a bad boy i'mma give you the lessons you deserve, come on

[Hook: T'melle]
Every time you cross the line you got me feelin' like, you got me feelin' like

[Chorus: T'melle]
When we were younger
Back in the day
We had this game
We use to play
Its funny how you make me feel the same way, we pickin' another flower baby
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
I'm just hoppin' that he don't get tired of me

[Verse 3: T'melle]
The way i be screamin' your name when ever you puttin' it down
Yeah that be the same way that i be screamin your name when ever i'm mad as hell
I be talkin my talk, talkin 'bout get in to my car
Talkin 'bout [?] up to your job cause this time you took it too far
But when they see me you takin' off my bra
And when i see you i'm takin' off your jawns
So give it to me till i can't take off mine
I forget what we was fightin' for

[Hook: T'melle]
Every time you cross the line you got me feelin' like, you got me feelin' like
Every time you cross the line you got me feelin' like, you got me feelin' like

[Chorus: T'melle]
When we were younger
Back in the day
We had this game
We use to play
Its funny how you make me feel the same way, we pickin' another flower baby
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
Does he love me? Does he love me not?
I'm just prayin' that he don't get tired of me

[Outro: Kevin Gates]
