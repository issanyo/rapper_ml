My momma she told me go get it, the money
I had to go get to the riches
Young nigga i had to change my life
Don't think about juuging at night
In the hood I earned my stripes
Got a white bitch cooking on ice
Young nigga walk around on the north side
Pockets fat Quavo Kelly Price
Apartment hallways shooting dice
Shoot a nigga Glen Rice

[ Verse 2: Kevin Getes ]
My pants they falling
Full cuff stacks i'm balling
I know its got name
I don't know what to call it
Her mano my partner
My diamonds are agua
I meant to say water i'm tripping
The Benji
The Benji
Go get it
My tender she pretty
With big tigobittys
Always itty bitty
Behind tinted windows
A black Honda civic with bricks in the fenders
Pull up in a foreign and leave in a rental
High credit card for hotel it's a dental
Designer everything thats on everything
Every day that I floss
Expensive watches everybody watchin'
And it ain't really nothing to a boss
Get lost

[ Verse 3: Takeoff ]
My momma she told me go get it the benji
I been graduated from midget
Believe it like I might be Ripely's
Trapping in Memphis but im no Grizzly
Run up on me you coming up missing
Glaww, glaww! Leaving no witness
I'm a young nigga and I want a milli
I fly cross the city to see ass and titties
Trying to run tricks on me grab at your ceiling
I'm really finessing these pigeons
I really be whipping these infants
Millis they all in my ceiling
The leaches still washing my dishes
Santa still coming on christmas
Callin' up Kevin, he open the gate
F&N sleep with me, that's my roommate
