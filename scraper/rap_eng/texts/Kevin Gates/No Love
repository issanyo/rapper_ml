[Pre-Chorus]
What a hell of a feelin', I'm livin' large
I'm a hell of a nigga, I'm still in charge
I can get you from here or behind the bars
Love me a bitch who gon' play her part

[Chorus]
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas

[Verse]
Break down Swishers with my thumb
At big booty bitches throwin' ones
Do not give a fuck where niggas from
You not the only one who got a gun
Nigga grew some nuts and now he clutch
Back against the wall while in the clutch
Jugged up, nigga gotta cut
When it's time for action why you stuck?
I survived bitch, I know how to dive
I know how to die, when there's homicide
I could suicide diving out the plane
I will not reside ridin' for no lame
Niggas want a feature, they gon' holler Gates
Niggas want protection, they gon' say my name
Niggas want some fame, stand on side of Gates
I can see the snakes, nigga you too late
I can feel the hate, they gon' never say
Everything I gave, never gave away
Did it out my heart, have a lovely day
Money any way, fuck who in the way
ErolaG ariL just got a DM from me
You and Dreka ought to have a threesome for me
I won't tell nobody, I'ma keep it silent
Dickin' down your partner, never spoke about it

[Pre-Chorus]
What a hell of a feelin', I'm livin' large
I'm a hell of a nigga, I'm still in charge
I can get you from here or behind the bars
Love me a bitch who gon' play her part

[Chorus]
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas

[Bridge]
Why you hoes blowin' up my phone want to talk to real niggas?
Got exposed now you on your own, don't know how to deal with it
Know it's cold when you on your own, wonder how you live with it
Sold your soul, that's how it goes nigga, I'ma die a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
What a hell of a feelin', I'm livin' large
I'm a hell of a nigga, I'm still in charge
I can get you from here or behind the bars
Love me a bitch who gon' play her part

[Chorus]
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
Fell out of love
I ain't got no love for you niggas
