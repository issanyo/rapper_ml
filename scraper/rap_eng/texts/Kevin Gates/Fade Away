[Bezz Believe]
First I mix that legal lean with that I don’t get tired then I call up Kevin Gates and the homie Mook Boy

[Chorus]
You best believe we on that paper chase
I talk that shit yo favorite rapper been afraid to say
He asked me for a front I told that bitch no way Jose
And I could get away with murder like my name OJ
And when these haters go to hate we hit that
Fade away, that fade away (you best believe, we hit that) that fade away, fade away, that fade away (that please believe)
That legal lean make me fade away
Fade away

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I’m a Steph Curry
Sip the lean, numb the pain, and pray it fade away man
Beat the body Johnny Cochran come and see today man
In the jungle we gorillas, we not bathing apes
OJ Simpson with the trigger we gon make you late

[Verse 1: Bezz Believe]
Talk shit but I could back it up
Grind hard no matter what
Rings, no sleep
Hell, been through Hell twice
And I’m still standing tough
I’m just doin me
Couldn’t give a fuck about a hater
Tell em get out yo feelings Hoe and go and get some paper!
Scurred off in that V12
I’m a heavyweight I don’t need a scale
From the moment I open my eyes all I do is see sales
Wholesale to retail that legal lean going worldwide
That UPS sending packages out about the size of a P12

Motivated by loyalty
Only thing that’s important to me
Diamonds dancing around my neck
Same price as a quarter key
South Georgia to the Florida Keys
I threw my stamp on the Sunshine
I swear to God I have money, cars, and 3 different hoes at one time

[Chorus: Bezz Believe]
[Hook: Kevin Gates]

[Verse 2: Mook Boy]
I’m piled up like door sale
You throwback like Nextel
I could piss on a 100K
Air force, Sho G, Fuck a record deal
Wrists at the bottom of the pot
Going in circles call that a windmill
New choppa got night vision
And a twist-a-round like a steering wheel
Pull up I just tested coke, pump some gas in, catch a coke deal
Keep telling her to slow down she don’t wanna chill coz she on them pills
Steph Curry with the Mac 11 I could take a shot and then I fade away
Tear never fall down my eyes but I murk something tatted on my face
Me and he’s in this rental car we strapped up and we came through
Push a button yellow top lift up like Donald Trump’s toupee
My dawg benz just crawled up and then laid down in the drive way
My bitch keep playing mind games she don’t know a nigga finna fade away

[Chorus: Bezz Believe]
[Hook: Kevin Gates]

I know somebody feel me
In the slum where its filthy
All praise to Allah
It gon be difficult to kill me
I Am Mujahideen, [?] the lean
Say he got a vest on
Pop! Ima shoot him in the knees
Make him fade away

I’m a Steph Curry, I’m a Steph Curry
Make you fade away
