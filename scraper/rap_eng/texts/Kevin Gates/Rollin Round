You only get one opportunity
If you don't know, it's gon' show
Real recognize real nigga


[Hook]
Whatever I spend, hustle too big
I'll get it again
Women pretend ( Tell you they love you)
I don't want to hear, go where you've been
Hustle too big( BWA!)
I know how to win, whatever I lend
I'll get it again
Rollin around with mills
I'm rollin around with mills (BWA!)
Don't want you to love me
I don't want to love you anymore
Rollin around with mills
R-rollin around with mills
I don't want to love you
Don't want you to love me anymore
Rollin around with mills
R-rollin around with mills
Don't want you to love me anymore


Don't know how to stand down
All we do is stand out
Pockets, rubber band out
I don't do no hand outs
Shots fired, man down
Boomboomboomboom
Lay him sound
She a stripper, I'mma trick her
Get her to my trap house (kill her)
Make her tap out
Finish, kick her ass out
Swear to God
I can't get caught up slipping with my pants down
I.D.G.T!I don't get tired
You should know what that's bout
Pants sagging, Gold medallion
Pray that we don't pass out

Hold up, I want stand up in they chest
What up? Cut up, bandanas on hammer
Rest in peace Big Hammer
I was supposed to play for the Panthers
But shoulder played in the slammer
Bunch of problems, no answers
Lee Lucas coming home
I can't wait till you get out
Me and Nook, Range Rover rugged
Day that you get out
I go mad, show my ass
I'm supposed to be somebody
I don't notice or nobody
Fouling parties, uninvited
All my haters they don't like it
Keep your girl up, unexcited
