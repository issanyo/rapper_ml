[Intro]
I'm goin' out a real nigga
Bread winner business
Shoutout to Baltimore
My H come out of Maryland, see
Bitch I'm from Maryland

[Hook]
Panoramic roof on my new Altima no Maserati
Low key in a rental boo so please don't tell nobody
She just tapped her homegirl look girl there go Luca Brasi
Excuse me bae I'm on a lot of drugs I'm out my body, lord
I swear I'm out my body lord
Look, please don't talk inside the car
This depression get the best of me
I'm in my thoughts I don't want to talk until tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Rest in peace to Lil Amp - bout it
Boy throwin' 4's in the south
Street nigga step team really pack gats, gold's in the mouth
Momma told me never hit a women but i bat hoes in the mouth
Make the trap roll in a drought
Get the pack goin' on the route
Talkin' that money shit I'm too intelligent
Flip on my flip then I jump in a bucket
When I'm in Cali you know I be thuggin'
I've been shot without a bad leg
Me and Cre Cre in Compton coolin'
On Caress Ave eatin' crab legs
I'm goin' out a real nigga
Bread Winner business

[Hook]
Panoramic roof on my new Altima no Maserati
Low key in a rental boo so please don't tell nobody
She just tapped her homegirl look girl there go Luca Brasi
Excuse me girl I'm on a lot of drugs I'm out my body, lord
I swear I'm out my body lord
Look, please don't talk inside the car
This depression get the best of me

[Verse 2]
Lightning fast from the left jab make the right, damn he throw pressure
Man I don’t need no effort, make the coke measure, treat the hoe special, baggin' coke rebellious
Take 'em to trial, no backin' down
The Luca comes out the day I'ma smile
All praise to Allah
The limbs blowing loud, my faith in the clouds
Legal tender we tippin' on strippers that’s my way of giving back, stay out my business
Walk like a general goin' organic, investin' in diamonds they made out of minerals
I'm with my niggas Starlito I kill for you
My heart droppin' knowledge in interviews
My grandmother told me that someones gonna love me the others gonna try to get rid of you
They call me Jesus, I speak the truth

[Hook]
Got a ramen roof on my new Altima no Maserati
Low key in a rental boo so please don't tell nobody
She just tapped her homegirl look girl there go Luca Brasi
Excuse me girl I'm on a lot of drugs I'm out my body, lord
I swear I'm out my body lord
Look, please don't talk inside the car
This depression get the best of me
I'm in my thoughts I don't want to talk until tomorrow
