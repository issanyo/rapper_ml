[Intro]
I mean I wanna talk a lil' shit

I mean, Lidocaine, Isotope, Bolivia, mother of pearl, Acetone
We really in the streets with it

[Verse 1]
With the acetone Rico press it back (I do)
Took a 4-way out each one and its jumpin' back
Five hunnit racks on a whole pack
Bad bitch on the road 'bout to run it back

[Bridge]
Cell phone ring that's another hunnit g's (hello?)
Asian out in Cali 'bout to send a bunch of p's
Cell phone ring that's another hunnit g's (hello?)
Asian out in Cali 'bout to send a ton of p's

[Verse 2]
You ever jumped out on a nigga block, ya heard me and just been like "Ay who the big dog is?"
I'm getting 'em whole, I'm gettin' the load
They come off a plane, they come off a boat
The eighteen wheeler pull up on the low (beep)
Backin' back into the zone (beep)
Pager we hit like a phone (hello?)
Text message I settle it wrong
Text somethin' your nigga be gone
He ain't on the connect that I'm strong
I send a hit and the pressure be on
Ridin' in Bentley's mind your business, I'm the business
We in the buildin'
Breadwinner, Mafia Material
Breadcrumbs, not with the cereal
Real one I look in the mirror
Dope in the pot here makin' a miracle
Hold on boo don't get hysterical
We in the gutter, shit a lil' scary
That's the new scary, I am not scared of, you are not fresh
What are you wearin'?
When I get dressed, people are starin'
Think what you want, I am not carin'
That my lil' hoe, I don't mind sharin'
She keep it solid, movin' in silence
[?] here in the [?]
Nobody perfect, we understand
Bought her kicks gave her some bands
She hold a set, thumbin' through that
I hit from the back, I make her tap
Pullin her hair, we in the trap
All the J's, seen 'em naked
Still servin' while I'm flexin'
Shirt off and I'm sexy
Skrt off in the Lexus
Straight raw, I'm a legend
Gold mack 9.11
Rap talk, I'm a veteran
Cookin' a brick and I'm makin it stiff
I got it coolin' right in the kitchen
Food boomin' right in the trenches
New booty give me your digits
Stickin' dick all in your kidneys, new jewelry, really ridiculous
New coupe, removable ceilings
Two scoop, nigga we drippin'
Ice movin' all in my dentures
Bitch bad, booty got dimples
Freckle face, the dude, he got pimples
Dunk her off, she's livin' in Denver
Migo call, tell him to send her
Wrong sides, service delivered
Rolls Royce, shittin' on niggas
Snow choice, both gonna kill him
Mouth swear, you cannot mimic
This high, I'm really livin'
Truth be told, I'm one of them niggas
Truth be told, I showed a few niggas
I'm a trophy, I’m in the city
Trap spot, we goin' digits
Push button, punish her with it
Glitch comin', in a few minutes
Say lil' daddy "why you pretending?"
Wasn’t for me, you wouldn’t be livin'
Pull up on site, hop out in vintage
I'm really wit' it, standin' attention
Makin' decisions, how we gon' fix this?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Show me where I ain't a real nigga dawg?
Show me where I hated on a nigga for?
Every nigga that ever came 'round me did better nigga
Ya heard me?
I appreciate your loyalty
