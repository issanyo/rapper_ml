Intro
Know i wanna be your love, baby how bout you? (baby)
So you know i want to be your love (dude leave all that there its gonna sound raw haha)

Chorus
So you know i want to be your love, baby how bout you?
Cause we could go across the world, whatever you want to do
The way you got me feeling, girl i'm wit it if you wit it
I ain't tryna play no games, babygirl lets just be serious and take our time with it

So if you want to roll with me, see girl i'm fine with that
Later on we could hit the sheets, shit where my condoms at?
As long as youre with me ill always have ya back, like girl are you fine with that?

Verse 1
You got me all up in my feelings, i can't control this
Dashboards doing digits, you know i'm rollin
Tryna get hooked with you, so we can smoke and
Hold hands by the end of the night slow dance
Don't take it to fast baby girl slow plans
Because time waits for no man, and if you want to go high
Just hold on tight and prepare to ascend
Float on now swerve, i gotta grind until it hurts
And i grind hard cause i know what i'm worth
So sorry but that money might just come first
Cause you know that i be putting overtime at work
But don't give up on me. cause your perfect at your worse
Find a better? i'd never search, wouldn't even be worth
No one on earth can do it like you do, i know you know it
That's why you do it like you do, and you keep me hypnotized
Too, thinking bout you in the coupe
With ya hair blowing through the roof
If you down with it then that's cool hell yeah that's bool
But don't you ever try to play me like a fool
(nah b*tch cause you gone get used like a tool aye)
Like girl are you fine with that?

Chorus
So you know i want to be your love, baby how bout you?
Cause we could go across the world, whatever you want to do
The way you got me feeling, girl i'm wit it if you wit it
I ain't tryna play no games, babygirl lets just be serious and take our time with it. (time with it)

So if you want to roll with me, see girl i'm fine with that
Later on we could hit the sheets, shit where my condoms at?
As long as youre with me ill always have ya back, like girl are you fine with that?
