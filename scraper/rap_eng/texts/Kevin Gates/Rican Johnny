[Intro]
Murder For Hire
Bread Winner Association
Comission guys are it
We got it for the next two summers, nigga
Take her backseat watch this
It's Holiday Season, bitch
Money count don't stop
Foreign cars, bad bitches
Suitcase full of money
(Holiday Season)
Nigga I don't get tired

[Hook]
Money really make me feel like I could be somebody
When I pull up in that Benz, beaucoup freaks surround me
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny
Money comin' to me ridin' round with duffel bags
Stacks of dirty money wrapped in beaucoup rubber bands
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny

[Verse 1]
My bitch is Tahoe, this whip came equipped with Moscato
My driver be drivin' me around
Gunner and Boobie, my clique full of shooters look stupid
They sendin' them rounds
While I'm in bounds, awkwardly I got an ounce
Groupies be followin' me around
Want me the take off the rubbers, you dummy it's nothin'
You fuck with a few of my rounds
Britches ain't baggy, but my pants are saggin'
This Five Panel hat and I just turned it backwards
Somewhat eclectic I don't fuck with rappers
I'm not into swaggin' but they love my swagger
Your bitch is an animal, fuck from the back
And it's somewhat degradin' the way I behave with her
Want me to stay with her, I could just play with her hard
On her feelings won't kiss her, won't lay with her

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I got paper to get
If I'm broke then I'd probably end up unhappy
I'm a ceramic, pull up on carbon ceramics
My bitch didn't deliver a package
The label has sued me, it threatened to take me to court
And you know we look at it like rattin'
They got in front of a song for like 8 minutes long
But that shit wasn't even effective

[Hook]
Money really make me feel like I could be somebody
When I pull up in that Benz, beaucoup freaks surround me
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny
Money comin' to me ridin' round with duffel bags
Stacks of dirty money wrapped in beaucoup rubber bands
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny

[Verse 2]
Where the bands at, rubber band that
Caught money givin' orders to a bitch, excuse me?
Finna say orders to your bitch
I ain't really even really wanna argue this shit I got a condo and a crib
And the people that I own it check, now nigga come get it how you live
Put that on the RIP, Rest in Peace to my nigga Weep got a feelin' that I'm on a muthafuckin' wig
Carve a pussy not at all a pussy, would it bother you or can I call you pussy?
On the phone with a bitch I can call for pussy, I ain't feed her no dick Im'ma starve the pussy
Palm with the balls and my arms in the pause, run a nigga up while your arms in the car
In the car unalarm, in the car with a alarm I was talkin' bout the feds if your offed then your on

[Bridge]
I'm in love with the way the money come off of these drugs
My conversations addictive some people might catch 'em a buzz
While you was in jail this nigga was fuckin' your fianc√©
That bitch gon' love and she gon' kik but she not Beyonce

[Hook]
Money really make me feel like I could be somebody
When I pull up in that Benz, beaucoup freaks surround me
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny
Money comin' to me ridin' round with duffel bags
Stacks of dirty money wrapped in beaucoup rubber bands
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny

[Outro]
Niggas playin' with my niggas when they not here
You know you owe some niggas money its gon' sound fair
Treat my nigga like he [living?] you a pussy nigga
And don't be rappin' on his name with all you pussy niggas
Ball,  welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
Ball, ball, welcome to Puerto Rico
You got that in there?
Let me hear that nigga
