[Hook]
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
You should know better
Do it all for my dogs, everyday goin' hard, I'm a winner
You should know better
Used to dream about a mil
Now we gettin' it for real
Shoulda left you right there where I met you
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
I'm a bread winner

[Verse 1]
Gettin' it in, gotta win, we not kickin' it
Bread winner team, we sick and we live with it
Whippin' machines equipped with a fridge in it
We the connect, we not bout to mention it
We with the shit, no talkin', we finish it
Some say I'm ignorant
Mecca, we touchin' September, I'm making my pilgrimage (Allahu Akbar)
Maybe I'm different
Looked at you like you were special, you not even build for this
UFOs in the crush Gates
So when it's up niggas goin' nuts
Big shit tucked, toolie on clutch
Pockets on lump, free my nigga Lump
Goin' out dumb
Engine on run
Thuggin' in the slums
Thumbin' through the hun's
Separate the ones
(Somebody called a riot?)
My daughter get the violets
Break bread, slidin', lay up in the Hyde
Room too expensive
Motel 6 and bitch quit trippin'
Niggas in feelin's
Wait don't wait, forklift liftin'
Brasi gon' fix the traps up, vision

[Hook]
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
You should know better
Do it all for my dogs, everyday goin' hard, I'm a winner
You should know better
Used to dream about a mil
Now we gettin' it for real
Shoulda left you right there where I met you
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
I'm a bread winner

[Interlude]
Hey man what you talkin' bout? Man just do you Gates
There it is

[Verse 2]
Dabbed in, front pockets stuffed
Money look like we been doin' lunges
Raised up in the blunt, I'm doin' crunches
Tattooed all over my stomach
Out in London talkin' to Big London
Stand up in they chest, okay I love you
Niggas hatin', wait I'm doin' numbers
In they feelin's, tell 'em I say fuck 'em
Hold up, wait, tell 'em that I love 'em
We could go, we had a discussion
Fame tend to blind the people on the side of you like you never mean nothin'
Focus on brand new things
Tryna show my children how to hustle
Teach 'em how to trust one another
All we got is us and your mother
Fall down, get back up again
Lose it all right before you win
Kevin man, you messin' up your gift
Shit like this be hard to come again
Fall bad, I know I admit it
Real struggle, I don't ever quit it
Thinkin' back when I ain't have a cent
Back when I ain't have a shit to give

[Hook]
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
You should know better
Do it all for my dogs, everyday goin' hard, I'm a winner
You should know better
Used to dream about a mil
Now we gettin' it for real
Shoulda left you right there where I met you
You shoulda known when it comes to the dough I'ma get it
I'm a bread winner

[Outro]
She spoken to me bruh. Yeah she spoken to me you know "I'm sorry bruh I like this shit, you heard me?" Shit bothered me
I'm a bread winner
