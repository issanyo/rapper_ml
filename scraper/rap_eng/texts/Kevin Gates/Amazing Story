[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Could tell the most amazing stories, I grew eyes behind my head
My senorita speaking leaving I ain't even trippin
Think that every time I'm not around it's other women
Lanlord that rap I don't give a fuck about nun of this shit
Ate her good while pulling her hair
She throwing her pussy back on this dick
I'm armed and retawdid giving orders to my squadrin
BWA Bread Winners Association, check me out
When I kill her from the rear I dick her down
(I don't get tired)
Feel that dick?
Like Julia Roberts on Pretty Woman, bitch on the lips I don't kiss
Got a 3 of Juice in my 20 ounce while I ride around, I sip
Been going hard, aiming for the stars, this foreign whip that I'm in
Say 'What up?' to you, won't smoke with you, me and bitch niggas ain't friends

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, If anything go wrong I know no one will ride for me
Garentee, could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head

[Verse 2: Yung Mazi]
They left a nigga for days, shot in the back of my head
I see you, no one was on my bed
Fuck the feds, fuck the feds
In a high ride with Low, I read, show you how to play
I never talk, I ain't have to say it
I took it, I didn't have a way
Eye behind my head, stay in that real view
Stay in that big Coupe, money not an issue
Blow paper, tissue
A bitch can't ever miss you
On me, 1, 2, pistols
Shooters geek my lil crystals
Bitches freak molly crystals
Wrist lighting up Christmas
Try it, I flipped it, kill this

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, could tell the most amazing stories I got eyes behind my head
Could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Truth be told, I'm a gun slanger
My nuts hanging to the floor
Your friends talk with their eyes telling me we should fuck on the low
We could leave the bed made up punch dick in your stomach all on this floor
Lick all between your little toes, don't do this type of shit with no hoes
Rip out their weave, fuck them hard, she say 'Gates you hurt my insides'
Now you feelin' how I'm feelin' really hurtin' on the insides
Never let your pride get in the way of what you really love
Killing emotion with too many drugs
Kiss on it, then lick it while up in the tub
(Recession of knowledge that wasn't in lighting thats why on the phone I'm knocking up on my cup?)
Bitch get up, fuck I'm sorry, that was suppose to last until tomorrow
I'm a gangster never in her life has she been around anyone like I

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
You said you'd never leave
Now who's gonna comfort me at night when I'm alone, oh?
Actually, hustle hard while in the trap long nights we get it on though
I'm stacking cheese, If anything go wrong I know no one will ride for me
Garentee, could tell the most amazing stories I grew eyes behind my head
