[Hook: Lil Phat]
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I move in units my city booming while under pressure
Screw being foolish, this opportunity, who you telling
I'm into rappin' and package handlin' for the family
And when I'm trafficking I'm ridin in Toyota Camry's
Supply to user but I'm the one who supply to mover
Ganging influence, comparing Gates to Larry Hoover
Forced to borrow soap and clothes, wasn't born rich
Nine scoring fits, foreign whips, and a foreign bitch
Restarted to extortion for Porsche in
Automatic panic, see the weapon that I'm sporting
I risk, feel I'm Mona Lisa, forever straight
Had to get her cousin cause she thicker than the Everglades
A lot of people feel it's wrong and it's fucked up
It's coming to ya front door, what the fuck for?
It ain't no life in the window, I got the curtain up
Confused, slinging them burgers behind the burger store

[Hook: Lil Phat]
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove

[Verse 2: Lil Phat]
They go that young ass thuggin' ass nigga out the top
I'm the trill fam youngin, you can bet he call shots
I remember on the block
When I was slinging rock
Now I sold them whole things, and open up shop
Had to shut down the spot, cause [?] got hot
Now I'm in the studio, the pen and pad my pot
I can whip it, I can flip it, I can show you what to do
From the street to the booth, [?] I'm the truth
Yea I got what ya' want for a nice price
Keep that heater thing for jackers I'll put it on ya' life
You don't grind, you don't shine, you don't hustle, you don't eat
You ain't no goon, you don't sling iron, you can't make it in the street
Yea I'm out here grinding, I love the money
I got all my money, to make em say you dummy
Got it have it right, when ya come to the store
I got Xan bars and X', I got lean and dro

[Hook: Lil Phat]
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
I like it fast, live lavish, I used to blow money
Then my nigga told me that slow be sho' money
Ima' beat the bock this money come to the door for me
Gotta' sell blow, 'till I blow up get show money
Sick of sitting, got me knowing what a milli do
Willing to break a leg for the figures, or lose a limb or two
I'm about somebody kill us, come get rid of you
I see through your facade and I question is it really you
Line up, fire, why you hiding, what you really shoot
I know some goons and when I send them they triggers whistle
Had me spitting on instrumental to figure the riddle
Find me in the middle, double little my competition
Anyone can get it, I'm with it, it ain't' no option is it
I feel it's my turn, you got to let us by
Won't pop a wheelie in the lead, I'm gonna peddle by
Clutching chrome, touching concrete like a set of tires

[Hook: Lil Phat]
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove
You gotta have cash to knock on my door
I make the block hot I bring out the dough
I bring out the yo
I bring out the dro
I make the block hot when I bring out the stove
