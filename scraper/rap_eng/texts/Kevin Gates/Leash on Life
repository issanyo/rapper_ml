[Verse 1: Starlito]
They shooting up movies, they shooting up schools
Young black fools ain’t the only ones that suit up with tools
Exercising my second amendment and pleading the fifth
With a fifth, this my second this Remy, I drink, I don’t sip
And the reason is this: it’s fucked up out here
So we out here fucked up, if you make it out then you lucked up
Trying to save ourselves coming from where we raised ourselves
Stuck between a rock and a hard place with the razor and a scale
Turn wine back to grapes and it's raising hell
Breaking down bales just to make bail
Catching sales off a cell 'til you in a cell
I’m just trying to prevail, well only time will tell
Well, niggas telling over time, ain’t no telling
I ain’t lying
Ain’t trying to go out like my homies did
I keep that on me and I put that on my homie's kid
Wonder if I gonna be missed, if I did a lonely bid
Got homies in the pen who only focus keeping a phone hid

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
When life comes with unexpected times I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hold the seatbelt right up
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to God I get a leash on life
Leash on tight, only right that we know
And please don’t judge us for the paths we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I' press the rewind

[Verse 2: Don Trip]
He got that strap in his bag, see he get bullied at school
Young nigga shot dead in his class, he put his school on the news
Now put yourself in his shoes, walking away didn’t help
He got no friend to defend him, he got to fend for his self
And he too skinny to fight, running away just ain’t cutting it
His daddy ain’t home, his momma still struggling
She juggle three jobs and get no help from the government
And you don’t know nothing about him but you trying to sucker him
Heart of a giant, I’m sorry he'll never back down
And they gonna keep pick on him 'til one day he blacks out
And reach in that book bag and he pull that mag out
Now he get the last laugh and you’re just the class clown
Tool on deck, yes, no I can’t help that
When momma was stressing, I hit my block like a tailback
See we trying to make it don’t got no suits, just got cases
And I need more than this dope money to leave to my babies
