[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Bitch, get naked disrespectful when we sexing
I-N-D-E-P-E whatever
Ain't got no time for spelling, bout time you start undressing
All that ass behind you yeah, I can see it from the front
Cutting up the 'ply, sipping gnac, blowing blunts
In the car, oh God I'm nasty
Just said don't put nothing past me
Behind it over, pull your hair, then smack it
Pressure, 'tron, scratching
Beat the pussy, I got come back
Now come back (come back) what's happening? (come back)

[Hook: Kevin Gates]

On the couch, making love, in a drug house (ugh)

Face down, ass up that's the way we like to fuck (you're right)
On that goose, you too loose baby, tighten up
On a deuce, sipping juice, that's my type of love (retawdid)
That's my type of, tattoos all on my body
My whips always exotic (skrrt!)

In and out of jail, I'm thugging
She hold it down, no question
Aggressive, get money, she love me, one hundred (ugh)

Big Chanel bag for the racks and the pistol
Riding for a nigga, she ain't never tripping
The Porshe Panamera coupe, she really about her business
Copped it off the profit, got a condo in the trenches
Flights taking off, she above them local bitches
