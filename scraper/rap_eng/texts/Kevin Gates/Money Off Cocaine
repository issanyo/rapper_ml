[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Money off cocaine, make money off cocaine
Pussy rappers be talking about it but never seen it dope game
Came up from nothing
In the slum its dangerous
Everybody around me on cocaine and angel dust
I swear we even dogs who witnessed they be turning up
If anybody play we blllbllbll and burn them up
Caus they be be turning up, turning up, you could believe I'm turning up, now turn me up
Everybody around me on cocaine and angel dust
If anybody play we blllbllbll and burn them up
Caus they be turning up

[Verse 1: Yung Mazi]
(Spanish)
I keep drinking like a cooler
2, 2, 3 came with the cooler
Now deebre, call Mezoter
Check he added them calmers
I see you, drama
I see you, t-trauma
Scared go to church
My rolley is Obama
Obama sweets, Obama seats
I'm Obama to the streets
I'm Osama with the heat
My shooters, my killer
Can't wait to turn up
Can't wait to count up
Can't wait to turn up
Got it out the mud
Pouring up the mud
Gotta catch me, gotta kill me
Fuck the judge
Rather count a mill nigga, fuck the club
Got the devil around me on angel dust
Got Gates with me, Young Thug with me
Your bitch with me, just a count up

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Thugga thugga baby
Turn up, turn up
Play, get bunked up
Beeze up, run up
My whole crew two gunners
Mazi, big bruh
Look at her
Sherow, too good, damn, nerves
Young thug you noise
I got 80 chainz, I got two notes
I'm on Miley Cyrus I have your notes
And my best dressed nigga yea yea
Got bricks like a motherfucking project
Got bricks like a motherfucking yea yea
All a nigga do is make profit
And I'm smoking on the best nigga yea yea
Chew 2000 make 3000
DK on a mother fucking watcher
DK got a fucking pocket rocket
DK not gon hesitate to pop it
Promethazine I slowed up
I'm poured up
Your bitch wanna cut us, then I moe her

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Trust Picture Focus
Rocking presidential rollies
Back out the trap here come the cash
I'm about to dash, my foreign fast
Do the do the dance, want a Kardashian
Hustle this fortuitous
(Procepable?) in time with peace
I'd rather die a solider
Mix the yoda with the soda
Coke and Toyota corollas
My nigga head got bust open for a fuck nigga
My heart broken
Big Sean know how I'm rolling
Take one of mine and I'm going in
Ain't shit, shower or shave for 16 days
'till I get that bitch I ain't going in
Jetlag on my going in
That's RT8 I'm blowing in
Back up camera I hate to use
I'm old school I'm know well
I broke two bricks to show broke niggas and hoes gon start I approaching in
If you try around me don't let me shake that because if I come back it's over then

[Hook]
