Bread winner for life
Got it tatted on my shit twice
I was trynna fuck with that other boy but they rat niggas like mice
Gambling habit my pants sagging
And I really like to shoot dice
Bet a hundred
Shoot a hundred niggas
Went to prision had a bunch of niggas
Everybody that's supposed to love me i ain't get a letter or a fuckin' nigga
Where the real niggas?
Don't cry about it disrespect me imma die about it
Going live lotta eyes watching, glass house
And a wide body
Baby momma sayin I wasn't shitten
She ain't even lying couldn't lye about it
Dope was cheap â€˜til election time then Obama won, prices skyrocket
