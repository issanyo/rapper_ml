[Hook]
My heart, my heart, callin' out to you
In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you
And we don't even talk anymore
Never knew separation anxiety before
Every time the leaves are changing
It's the loneliest time of year

[Verse 1]
Wait hold on baby, you don't have to leave let's talk it out
If you say you're no longer happy, you can turn around
Burn all my belongings if you can't figure it out
I don't really need those things anyhow
But every time the lights go down in the room
... me and you
Never meant to say all those things causing so much pain
Now my thoughts on the floor so confused
Listen to .....

[Hook]
My heart, my heart, callin' out to you
In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you
And we don't even talk anymore
Never knew separation anxiety before
Every time the leaves are changing
It's the loneliest time of year

[Verse 2]
My favorite book's The Notebook by author Nicholas Sparks
Built a staircase just to runaway, but she won't make it far
Every time the leaves start changing we're lonely just like before
And I don't really need those things anyhow
Her bein' the reason why I can smile
Settle down, think I know a real fly place
A coffee shop around the block from where I once stayed
