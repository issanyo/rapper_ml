[Pre-Hook]
What if God was one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Lookin' for love in the club like one of us
Tryna' make it out the slums like one of us

[Hook]
What if God is one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Gettin' it out the mud like one of us
Makin' calls to the plug like one of us

[Verse 1]
Makin' calls to the plug
Tryna' ball, going hard I'm not ballin' enough
I got scars on my heart come from fallin' in love
On my knees every night placing calls up above
Seem like God won't pick up
If Heaven won't show me a way
Guide me when I grip the weight
'Cause in the city we livin' in it's kill or you gettin' killed
I was taught to keep it real, misguided in the field (pop pop pop pop pop)
Forgive me I done gripped the steel
She the devil, she was bad, long weave, beaucoup ass
Frownin' up, make pretty faces, when I'm hittin' her from the back
And I got caught and I ain't rat, some beaucoup guys she ain't hit back
I done been to hell and back, 'cause I done been to jail and back

[Pre-Hook]
What if God was one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Lookin' for love in the club like one of us
Tryna' make it out the slums like one of us

[Hook]
What if God is one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Gettin' it out the mud like one of us
Makin' calls to the plug like one of us

[Verse 2]
Makin' calls to the plug
I fell off then got up
I'm standin' tall no matter what
Real nigga never budge
Thinkin' thou shall not judge, while I stood in front the judge
Media they tellin' lies about me that don't matter much
Hey now, turn it up
I just got back from the future don't know what I'm speakin' of
Hey now, turn it up
Leave you leakin' just for reachin', ain't no drinkin' out my cup
Shawty yellow, awe yea, slim she Barbie Doll bad
She got pregnant from my partna', so I had to fall back
She was wit' another rapper, hold up I can't talk that
Text her when she call back
If I ain't a dick slanga' tell me whatcha' call that

[Pre-Hook]
What if God was one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Lookin' for love in the club like one of us
Tryna' make it out the slums like one of us

[Hook]
What if God is one of us
Just a thug like one of us
Gettin' it out the mud like one of us
Makin' calls to the plug like one of us

[Outro]
Out the mud
Makin' calls to the plug like one of us
Out the mud
Makin' calls to the plug like one of us
