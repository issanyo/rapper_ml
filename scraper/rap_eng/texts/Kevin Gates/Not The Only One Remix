[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Say you love me, yeah
(Say you love me, yeah)
I know that I'm not the only one
Struggles I done overcome
I killed that nigga for my dogg and now he owe me one

[Verse 1: Flowz Dilione]
Cut the grass, all I see is snakes
People hatin on me they were never mates
Jealous so they wanna see me in a grave
Talk about it, but they ain't really brave
They be leavin, thought she was gonna stay
Never showed pain crying in the rain
Moved on nah I never run away, if you hate me then say it to my face
Dudes talk shit, bitches playin games
I'm too busy putting food up on my plate
If you're with me then you ain't gotta say it, one phone call will have you on a plane
I know who is real, don't know who is fake
Let her go before so I'll shoot again
Got my father's blood running through my veins, kill you for my mum I'm just being real
I know that I can't be the only one, that's just how I feel, know you can't relate
Tryna make a mill you're just in my way, I don't get tired tryna win the race
I know that I can't be the one you love, you don't really love me
You just love the fame, you have gorgeous eyes they don't see my pain
Baby I'm a star we are not the same

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dogg and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Actors got stripes they ain't never earned
Not a freak for fame, rather wait my turn
Say he tell it, tell it put him in the dirt
Fuck his family members, they can wear his shirt
Every rapper talkin' cookin' dope
Flippity flip, break-break the wrist
I desire and I would be alone, no attention if it's ignorance
To say it frankly, I don't give a shit
Breathin' hard, come on say what's in your thoughts
Somethin' on your mind, I could take it off
Money mean nothin', I want my respect
Different focus on tatted on my flesh
Hoes in my clothes, underarms smellin'
Million man march this ain't Malcolm X
Where I'm fair receivin' government assistance
Get up out the bed, spend up all they check
How you don't know that, you ain't never gagged
What you mean by yay, talkin' sellin' crack
Embalming fluid, run to Montana
Thinking going back and peddle where
Pistols, rentals, thugs stoppin' up the rig
Renegade hoes settin' up the trick
Junkies usin' H, it's a better feel

[Hook]

[Outro: Kevin Gates]
Ain't been havin' no dreams
Don't be gettin' no sleep
How could someone call me those things
They don't even know me
I lost everything I love and we could go
Loyalty which probably mean the most
Heart played on every time I gave
Makin' me a freak bitch
