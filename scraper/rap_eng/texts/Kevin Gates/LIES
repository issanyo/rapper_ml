[Intro]
Yeah, swag
Luca Brasi
My nigga Luca Brasi in the building man
Street niggas only
Yeah OK

[Verse 1 Swag]

Broad soft but this shit hard
I'm a damn pro in that kitchen
Streets dead I'm Finna wake me up and my whole city they listenin
Talk stupid in your rap song and my whole team we blitzing
Hold the choppa like a hand tool everybody round this shit gets it
Been about my business you think different then come try me
Somebody get this nigga my X-ray there ain't a pussy bone in my body
I make my gunna split the whole 32 he'll let em off in the lobby
Like fuck how we pull a homicide it was just supposed to be a robbery
Real niggas on side me
Fake niggas beind you
See this that music you grind to
I raise my wrist I might blind you
A bitch say I stumbled I ain't trying to
Swag who the fuck is you lying to?
All that money when you riding through you say you bout your business I'm bout mine too

Whe

[Chorus Gates]
All up in the lights
Ain't no wrong or right
Killing over nothing
Waring over stripes
Discretely speaking of heaven and we make it our lives
But forever's such a very long time
Solo in the game, all I think about is you
Tell a lot of lies but we make me sound true
Don't know who I am, I just know I've bought a louvre
Tell a lot of lies Tell a lot of lies but we make em sound true

[Verse 2 Kevin Gates]
So hard but the coke soft on the coke hand no kitchen
Both hands on pistols
Through windshield when they spinning
I saw jail
I embraced jail like at least I'm here with my niggas
When its not nothing we'll rob something
When we got something we spilt it
Pops trippin like he mad at me
I was tryna see what I deal em
Last nigga I really loved been dead n gone but I miss him
Triggers will blast I won't slip on no mess
I might come get yo ass From the clique doing back
Got a bitch and she bad when I'm broke on my ass
Don't need to pretend that bitch gone with the wind
Stand on my own so I'm stronger than them
I suffered I struggled I'm hard imma win
Got a coroner to spend if you run up a nigga
Punch in yo stomach you vomit yo nigga
Why the fuck, why is you comfortable nigga?
Gotcha you a luxury car and a stripper
Sniffing n sniffing you said you gone get it
Menace that pussy I know what I'm killing

[Chorus Gates]
All up in the lights
Ain't no wrong or right
Killing over nothing
Waring over stripes
Discretely speaking of heaven and we make it our lives
But forever's such a very long time
Solo in the game, all I think about is you
Tell a lot of lies but we make me sound true
Don't know who I am, I just know I've bought a louvre
Tell a lot of lies Tell a lot of lies but we make em sound true

[Outro Swag]
Yeah man
Its easier said than done man
You know when 2 real niggas come together man
This what you get man
Street shit only man
You know what I'm saying you already know man

Shouts out my hood man west bank maroubra all day ya heard me?
