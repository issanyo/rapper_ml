You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here they feast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Can't show no teeth out here teeth here
Mark of the beast out here

Verse 1(Devious)

Land of the free how can we sleep
What are we doing?
Stand up for me hand up for me what ya pursuing?
Death or it's life life or it's death
Ashes to ashes or take your first breath
Take you a right or take you a left
But never just chill with the cousin of death
How could you judge how do you know what is the premise
They kill in the hood but livin is good
Look at our prisons
And dreams are deferred when life is a blur but mind ya own bizness
And god has the gavel and god is the jury who is the witness
Through peril and famine our teens carry hammers and go to the slammer
No thought of regret or presence of mind and nothing's examined
They pay it no mind they see but they blind they narcoleptics
But how could you sleep and never consider who's really affected? Who Knows

Chorus

You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here can't  show no teeth out here
Mark of the beast out here

Verse 2 (Kevin Gates)

Psychoanalysis which I performed on myself
What that is? Alarming myself
Seeking help from the higher power divine knowledge can't call on myself (Oh Lord!)
Thought that I may have encountered my happiness
Only in that I made it hard on myself
Spirit willing when the flesh weak
Profit of god in the makin
In the mirror I see it my left eye is evil
I'm beautiful, Lucifer, Satan
In the kitchen we cookin no apron
Providing the poison who willing to take it (it's raw)
Selling they soul like when we sellin gold
Only led to a cell and me layin alone
My plug on the line my delivery comin
I'm tormented lord just deliver me from it (Get on the ground!)
Jumpin up outta my sleep to get money or could I be rushing to an early death (Blat!)
Ran in the streets lotta ignorant hustlin
Guns go to bussin they'll burn ya chest (ew!)
On my knees in the hospital another chance and I'm back in it
Lied to God in jail again said I was quittin but I'm back with it

Chorus

You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Mark of the beast out here
Ain't  no peace out here
You sleep out here sleep out here
Can't be sleep out here
Can't show no teeth out here
Mark of the beast out here

Verse 3 (Devious)

Tossin and turnin twistin and burnin what are you learning
Who to believe are u deceived
What are you earnin
What's if it's right what's if wrong
Turn on ya phone check out this song
Should you rebel or should you condone who got the answer to carry us home
That's deep huh like Plato, that's devious and gates yo
No sleep huh just wake bro that's confidence or that's faith yo
All in the mind all in the brain who can protect it
Keepin you in or keepin you out now what is neglected
The prince of our peace r the mark of the beast
Should we go west or should we go east
Free from it all or tied  on a leash
Whatever the answer we never gon sleep
----we meditate, we all wanna go inside heaven gates

Chorus

You sleep out here sleep out here

Can't show no teeth out here
Mark of the beast out here
