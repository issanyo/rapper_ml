[Chorus]
Annie are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay Annie
Say Annie are you Okay A
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay Annie
Say Annie are you Okay A
Are you okay Annie?

[Verse 1]
Without a pot to piss in
No window to throw it out
Came in the game blind
But this what I know about
They teasing me in school
People calling me fat
Think I saw the world different
But ain't all of it bad
Tryna leave the street alone
But they calling me back
Only time I feel like anything
And saying anything
You left right when I needed you
I would of gave you anything
Am I not a man if I cry on the page
On my knees saying "Why Lord"
No, I'm not at all
Perfect but I try Lord
Or in the same prayer
Should I say I try hard
Painkillers watching Bruce Willis die hard
Pusha T on the beat Yelling

[Chorus]
Annie are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay Annie
Say Annie are you Okay A
Are you okay Annie?
Annie are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay Annie
Say Annie are you Okay A
Are you okay Annie?

[Verse 2]
If you could make it out my hood
You could live in a different country
Grew up in Baton Rouge
In this bitch like a different country
What I'm suppose to do
When killers warring with me
Tuck tail wear a thong
Be a bitch in the streets
Window shot up
But I'm still with the Mafia
People say "Gates keep the steel on the side of you"
Last Instagram think the meal was Tilapia
Months ago in court
Facing 30 years
Major monicker with a major facing 30 M's
Still in remorse to my thoughts
I murdered them
Little girl you still daddy baby
Know I hurted them
Right when they needed me the most
I deserted them

[Outro]
Annie are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay Annie
Say Annie are you Okay A
Are you okay Annie?
