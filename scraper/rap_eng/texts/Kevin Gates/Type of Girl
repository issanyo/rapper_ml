[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Man, look, check this out, look
Man, fuck all that man, just listen to the music
The music telling you to come with me
Give your girl the key man
You know you can chill til Uber get here to get you
After you get this dick man what?

[Bridge: King Ko$a]
Got a thing for the thick women
She gon' light it up imma roll one
She know I will make her mine
But a nigga like me can't choose one
She gonna hit me for the business
I'm gon hit her with the finish
Baby, Imma work you out
Show you that a young nigga really do this

[Chorus]
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
That's the type of girl I hold it down for
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
She know I'd hold it down for

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
What you doing send an uber
50 shades of Gates on her sofa
Forgot to move it right after you bend over
Sip a lot of lean opposite of sober
Goddamn
And I'm going ham, pull you closer
Grip you by your neck while I nibble on your shoulder
Text messaging "oh, woah"
In my phone like when you coming over
I don't talk but I listen I'm a real nigga
Pull your hair, talk bad when I deal with ya
She gon' light it up and maybe I'm a chill with her
Big thighs, slim waist, bitch real different
She got her own whips, and a crib with it
Swimming pool out back, skinny dipping in it
Double Mac with the flap
Got the semi with me
Thick girl cutting up when the liquor in her
Running from me when I jump say she feel it in her
Kevin dick, too addictive come on say you nice
Tryna gimme money come on got it off the block
Stand up, gotta stay with me, double stock
Hold it down before you get it, touching every spot
Tie her to the head rail, she be wilding out
Too deep, Kevin please yelling "take it out"
When her face in the pillow hard to make it out

[Bridge: King Ko$a]
Got a thing for the thick women
She gon' light it up Imma roll one
She know I will make her mine
But a nigga like me can't choose one
She wanna hit me for the business
I'm gonna hit her with the finish
Baby, Imma work you out
Show you that a young nigga really do this

[Chorus]
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
That's the type of girl I hold it down for
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
The girl I'd hold it down for

[Verse 2: King Ko$a]
I got a thing for the latinas
Pick her ass up in the black beamer
Or I might just do her in black beamer
She could call her friend come and tag team
She gon' leave all the drama for the actors
And we gon' leave all them games for the packers
No sequels, no missing chapters
And we always getting high like we climbing ladders
Lil mama know she a dime
Hoes throwin shade she still shining
And Imma slide in like a zipline
All these haters acting sour like good wine
I pass through her crib when I got time
A nigga on the road needing dollar signs
Gold diggers see me as a gold mine
But i don't see them hoes like I'm going blind
Kosa!
She calling my phone when she get horny
She in the bed all alone, can't do without me
I'm kissing her thighs touching her body
And she know I be gone in the morning cause a nigga

[Bridge: King Ko$a]
Got a thing for the thick women
She gon' light it up Imma roll one
She know I will make her mine
But a nigga like me can't choose one
She wanna hit me for the business
I'm gon hit her with the finish
Baby, Imma work you out
Show you that a young nigga really do this
Oh

[Chorus]
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
That's the type of girl I'd hold it down for
That's the type of girl I'm fucking with
She know I'd hold it down for her
