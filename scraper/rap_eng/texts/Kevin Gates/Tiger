[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
As luck would have it my best friend
The brown skin nigga with the braids
Not the pussy nigga with the fade
But the short chubby nigga with the braids
Got out of jail I was flat broke
Well not broke but low funds
Funds lower than they ever was
I was tryna rap without selling drugs
Me and Eric Taylor kept grinding hard
But every plan just fell apart
His mama died every night I cried
And prayed to God to protect his heart
The label kept on booking shows
Most of which was a instant flop
This means I would appear
And perform without getting guap
This the part where it gets evil
Got deceived, couldn't believe it
My social next to a signature on a contract where I didn't leave it
Me and Tone had a lot of talks
Til' it ain't really make sense to talk
Told him what I needed as a artist
He would say ok and then brush it off
Rap game, calling for me
Let's run the ball no fucking off
Travis Vick and the name I said
Forever I'ma have love for him
Had to focus on my career
Others tryna be club owners
Got the ears of a major label
Now everybody in the world on it

[Hook]
Heart of a tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challenger or rival
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
N.T.M.A. to police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger

[Verse 2]
Altercations, I'm thinking Travis must really hate me
Been like a brother through middle school, woulda never rapped until he made me
Really used to flip hoes together, go out together, do shows together
Still amazes me, kinda crazy how popularity can make you change
Got his Nova, I was happy for him
Got his 'Burban, I was happy for him
Got his Benz, I was happy for him
Got his Hummer, I was happy for him
No nigga round I wouldnta splattered for him
Put their head on a platter for him
Never disrespected your bitch boy
I protected your bitch boy
When niggas that we both know was tryna put dick on your bitch boy
All you ever did was criticize me
Pillow talk to the world bout me
These tear drops on my face real, my mom will tell you I'm not stuntin'
Juvenile detention for self-defense, broad day I popped somethin'
Her ex-boyfriend broke her ribs, blacked her eyes, I shot somethin'
'scuse me, I'm my own man
In jail or on land
Always tryna fight me
How the fuck you hurt a nigga you love
I would never put my hands on you, reason being you a nigga I love

[Hook]
Heart of a tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challenger or rival
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
N.T.M.A. to police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
N.T.M.A. to police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger
