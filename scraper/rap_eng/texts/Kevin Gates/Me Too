[Intro]
Rock Boy Beats
That nigga Ladd got the juice, boy

[Chorus]
Heard you want a nigga that's gon' please you
Suck your toes, dick you down, please you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
Girl, you're addicted and I need you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
I like fuckin' you in public, she say, "Me too"
She don't like using no rubber, I say, "Me too"
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm thuggin', I say, "Me too"

[Verse 1]
Touchin' the top of your ass (ooh)
Popular view when I give it a smack (come here)
Make you say "Ooh" when I hit from the back (ooh)
Baby, don't run, put a arch in your spine (arch)
Dick from behind, while you wiggle that ass (shit)
When I'm in public, I feel on that ass (feel on that ass)
Strip club, 400 a dance (damn)
A lot of niggas wanna touch on that ass
In the mall, goin' shoppin' for bags
Dressing room, while you undressin' I grab it (come here, girl, I got you)
A big ol' handful of that ass (oh shit)
1942 in your glass
I'm up the strip, I could sent you a Lyft (want me to stay there?)
Stay loyal, I might get you a whip (I could)
First class flight, get you a trip (phew)
Want me to take orders, get you a bitch (get you a bitch)

[Chorus]
Heard you want a nigga who's gonna please you
Suck your toes, dick you down, please you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
Girl, you're addicted and I need you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
I like fuckin' you in public, she say, "Me too"
She don't like using no rubber, I say, "Me too"
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm thuggin', I say, "Me too"

[Post-Chorus]
Is you down? 'Cause I'm down, she say, "Hell yeah"
Can I pick you up? Dick you down? She say, "Hell yeah"
I say is you down? 'Cause I'm down, she say, "Hell yeah"
Can I pick you up and dick you down? She say, "Hell yeah"

[Verse 2]
Grab her legs, throwin' 'em up in the sky (wee)
We both wakin' up in Dubai (Allahu Ahkbar)
Break bread at the table then I
Eat the pussy from the back and the side
Let you get on top, you can drive (oh shit)
Bread Winner, we free enterprise (oh yeah)
Cuff you, I'm unwillin' to try (can't do that)
Fuck you like no other guy
Runnin' through it, did a small bit of time (I did)
Movin' forward, something in me to grind (yew)
Diamonds on me, they reflect and I shine
Rich sex, beat the pussy, goodbye (take off)
Send text hopin' you will reply (I do)
Need you to come kick it tonight (for real)
Lick on your titties and look in your eyes (oh shit)
Kissin' your kitty, wait, hold up, wait mwah

[Chorus]
Heard you want a nigga who's gonna please you
Suck your toes, dick you down, please you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
Girl, you're addicted and I need you
She say, "Bae, I'm nasty", I say, "Me too"
I like fuckin' you in public, she say, "Me too"
She don't like using no rubber, I say, "Me too"
She wanna fuck me 'cause I'm thuggin', I say, "Me too"

[Post-Chorus]
Is you down? 'Cause I'm down, she say, "Hell yeah"
Can I pick you up? Dick you down? She say, "Hell yeah"
I say is you down? 'Cause I'm down, she say, "Hell yeah"
Can I pick you up and dick you down? She say, "Hell yeah"

[Outro]
Hell yeah, for real
