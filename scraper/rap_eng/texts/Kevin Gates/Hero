Got on white drawers
Hope I don't shit myself
Got my brick watch me shit myself
Toothaching up in this bitch
Shawty smoking boo koo loud
They free my phone
Won't leave you lone

[Hook]
A coward dies a thousand times
And a soldier dies uno
Immortals die zero, zero zero zero
Left up to me I'd rather die a hero
(2x)

[Verse 1]
Choppas out go blaaat kapow
Let me catch you slipping and you ride up on em
Riding round the median see us speeding
While chief grinning these tires shreeching out
One more fool stomach so unfull
Bet it don't look good when them heaters easing out
Lived everything you can seem to speak about
That's your bitch I ain't mean to freak her out
See what the desert eagle beak about
All I know is cocaine
My uncle been to jail free Lee Luke
Product of the dope game
Thinking back its just retrospective
Few people need to be reprimanded
Thugging bad with a bag of cash
Shoutout to Fee I got duffle bags
I survived shots with the gun cocked
Found out who it was I was unshocked
Played hot blocks let cops watch
Stacked money for a house now I run shop
That nine up in this bitch
Blowing Ryan up in this bitch
Pussy rappers smile but they pissed
All they rhymes sounding like shit
And I'm the shit

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2]

Say Gates my girl just cheated on me
Fuck that bitch that's her lost
Look at it like that's another nigga problem
In New York they call that a jump off
Your dick will hate a good jump off
Choking smoking my lungs off
My bare bitch don't run cross
Spray the pump off make it slump y'all
Like a millionaire and I'm vision impaired as if all I can see is the loot
Beautiful women prepared for whatever I ask and they staring at me and my crew
No disrespect was intended for Kendrick Lamar don't know shit about liquor and pools
While in the water they giggling twos watch I hinder the threesome and lick her in pools
Follow me you
Niggas in twitter expressing they feelings because all they bitches unfollowing you
Talking that silliness not comprehending it what the fuck I look like talking to you
This ain't Street Fighter I'm not good at kicking it you must look at me like Ken or Ryu

[Hook] (2x)
