[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Yeah, yeah
You hear my voice you already know what I been doin' bruh you heard me
Say Mazi you love me? 'Bout to show off for you baby
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin', still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin' and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, I wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
When you came home, I was excited
I looked up to my cousin
The world been cold
My heart been taken
I got somebody who love me
[?] Port Allen in jail be toein' Brian and the feds
Kept it silent, dyin' inside
I wasn't right in the head
I lied to you wit' what I said, I shot myself in the head
Doin' drugs, easin' pain
I hate to get outta bed
Even ran off on my daughter
I admit I was scared
I know I could've gave her order
I was better off dead
5.7 in the cartridge
I ain't takin' precaution
I ain't scared of a army
I was tryna lay in my coffin
Smokin' without coughing
Early morning go walkin'
When my dog was still alive
We ain't never go without talkin'

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin', still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin' and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, I wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Christmas, I don't celebrate
We on two different means
We was suppose to be retarded
Big old house full of kids
We was suppose to cop Ferrari's
For your bitch and my bitch
Takin' sips of lean with every blunt that we twist
Remember we fucked T together
Lied and said we was twins
We even did our beards together
You come out, I go in
Late night at the car lot schemin'
On a big body benz
I'd of fucked my wife with you
That's just how this shit is
Niggas in my ear been tellin' me on you they gone spin'
Although you cut me, I still love you I don't know how to pretend
Light lil' blender with lil' Kale just to touch on her skin
Take my pain out on her pussy and then be puzzled again

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin', still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got eatin' and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
