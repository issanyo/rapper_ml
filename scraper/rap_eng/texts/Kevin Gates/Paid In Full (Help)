[Intro]
You whattup?
Man what that is, love
Hey look this some of that exclusive, you heard me?
You know, this some of that, you know, luxury ride type shit
Check this out

[Verse 1]
Sick man grinding hard, hard to switch lanes
Aviators, sleep-deprivated, ain't ate in six days
Had a belief and we team never believe in me
Begin to be misleading ? had the shift changed
You niggas shit brained
Cause you believe anything you see on tv without going there
Seeing homeless, right around the corner
Hungry, starving, underprivileged
Needing garments, but'll bargain with the dealer fixing fixes
I'm a god to these niggas
God-willing I'll depart with my winnings
Play it smart or be caught up in the system
Beat the odds, odds in, my dogs seekin' a pardon
Poker stare, I wasn't playing fair, I threw my cards in
My nigga wifed a B, I treat her like trash
Thinking this ain't have to happen had he never made me mad

[Break]
I'm saying though, you like to fight?
You can fight for your life, don't play with me
See a lot of niggas don't be knowing
I be doing real shit, ya heard me
You're now rocking with ya boy Kevin Gates
I'm just trynna be your favorite rapper, that's it
What's the point of having soldiers if you can't use 'em?
You know the Puerto Rican kid, he be popping wheelies and shit
Sell a lot of coke, what the fuck I do, man
Nigga know wassup, I'm tryna get paid in full

[Verse 2]
Bread winner street game, look who in the air chillin'
Flare the pistol, now the paramedics gotta airlift him
Wings on the skull, what I tell to the judge
Not demonic but it symbolizes hell from above
Got a cell-button bug, paper trail never budge
Assailant selling drugs, never tell on the plug
I'm a thug, what that mean? True hustler, under God
Took something, under arm percussion, for who harm
Muzzle swarm, no discussion concussion, make it hard to talk
When he not thinking or walk when he not breathing
Quality street music, which targets the law beaters
Paw grieving, Lord please be with the mother of this motherfucker
Led by assumption, only right that the metal touch you
Safe to say Kevin Gates is a motherfucker
Luca Brasi

[Outro]
I thank y'all for sitting through the lecture, you know
I love each and every one of y'all on a personal basis
I wouldn't say that if I ain't mean that
That mean I really do mean that, I really do mean that
Mane, what the fuck you looking at me like that for?
Bitch what you want do something
I'm just fucking with you, thug
Now go 'head 'fore I put that iron on yo pussy ass
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, thug
