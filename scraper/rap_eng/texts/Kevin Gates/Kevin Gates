[Intro: Kevin Gates]
We had some bumps along the way, but the reward is in the journey
I'm in my bag

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I left from global tours almost in my peak, then have to go sit down in my clink, just to reach the peak again
Mad with prison guards, turning keys
Mad with God, why he don't answer me while on my knees, I'm in need, I believed
Life don't ever turn out how we want but I succeed
I hustled a lil bit pursuing things which I achieved
I told my wife my plan, I also told her she could leave
She cried her eyes out, the abruptly she disagreed
I had to talk in code while giving orders to the streets
Executive staff, two board members, they on my team
Execute affairs whenever matters get decreed
I played by the rules, received my slot from out the beam
Big general nigga, game literature giver
When you stand on nation business this shit come before your children, this shit come before your feelings
Niggas shoving dick in my lil hoe, I took no interest
Lost emotions on my last bitch, past tense, now I'm just pressure
Niggas shooting, taking shots, that don't leave no impression
Gates don't ??, And I don't get aggressive
Hanggliders moving silent, if you hearing impared
Get your brains blowed out, put your feet in the air
People under my stairs, cold hearted my staff
Buy one hoe, I'm protected
Took some losses, no question
But we only fear Allah, walk anywhere, no protection
By my father, neglected
The pressure hit, I'ma sell it
Seeking love out in the slums and got embraced by the ghetto
Right leg under took some fire, still got traces of metal
Upright independent feelings, bitch we die it's whatever
That case you had, it got deferred, you agreed to some telling
I lost some fights I never told, I never fold under pressure
Took some time accepting mine, go look it up for the record
Dead broke while in New Orleans, people thought I was balling
Rented a black Maserati, just for one of my artists
When Versace Jewelry was hot, I was the one who had bought it
Put the roof over your head, when I had just had a daughter
Show me where I hated on you, back stab me too often
Dealing with the opps, while I'm in California recording
Put you in a grey Camaro, just invoice me, I spent it
Paid Pepper that lil money that we borrowed, remember?
I stood up for you when they said you was messing with children
They say I'm signing sex offenders, niggas right in my city
I told you "fuck em, just stay focus, you gon' blow any minute"
Transistion play hard, that's your defense mechanism
You still my favorite rapper, though you like him turn you against me
You really hurt, I see your pain, you dissing me cause you miss me
You really hurt, I see your pain, you dissing me cause you miss me

[Outro: Kevin Gates]
Ain't nobody never love you like me(never in life), and you know that
When you sit around in the room remember one thing, if you can't be used, you useless
Big Alsace
I been a gentleman
