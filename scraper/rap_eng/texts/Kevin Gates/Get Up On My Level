[Intro]
Get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level

[Verse 1]
Tongue kissin' a pint in public (Can't see you niggas)
No feelings ain't no bitch I'm trustin' (Can't see you niggas)
Faces that she make disgusting (Can't see you niggas)
Throwin' dick inside her stomach (Can't see you niggas)
Cause hurt cause I been hurt before (Can't see you niggas)
Love don't live here anymore (Can't see you niggas)
Racks spent on designer frames (Can't see you niggas)
Rocking shades to hide the pain (I can't see you niggas)

[Hook]
Money ain't shit, got it all day, get it all day
Hoes y'all chase, wanna fuck me
The things you niggas brag about, ain't shit to me
I feel it's only right to say
You niggas need to get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level
You niggas need to get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level

[Verse 2]
Ain't squeal when the polices took me (Can't see you niggas)
Fresh to death in central booking (Can't see you niggas)
Lick was for my team I took it (Can't see you niggas)
Not thinking they would play me pussy (I can't see you niggas)
Talked about when I'm not looking (Like Stevie Wonder)
Played with keys while making music (Like Stevie Wonder)
Smiling bright throughout my struggle (Like Stevie Wonder)
Rich as shit but can't see nothin' (I'm just like Stevie Wonder)

[Hook]
Money ain't shit, got it all day, get it all day
Hoes y'all chase, wanna fuck me
The things you niggas brag about, ain't shit to me
I feel it's only right to say
You niggas need to get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level
You niggas need to get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level, get up on my level

[Verse 3]
Goin' hard for 'em in the paint, never had a real family
That nigga, I call daddy
I never had a real daddy
They was already making music
I just added rap talent
Came out of prison pursuing my dream now everybody mad at me
I ain't never try to diss y'all
All I ever did was tell the truth
Pray every one of y'all artists make it
Don't or do, I still salute
Got real niggas, from New Orleans
All they do is click homers
Made men don't make statements
You bigger than that, that's phony
Want every nigga that rap, from Louisiana to make it
Medication then meditation and elevatin' to greatness
"I'm not bothered by your dissin'", you was in your feelings
Gave you niggas my all and you mistreat your niggas
Now I can't see you niggas

[Outro]
Get up on my level, get up on my level
Love don't live here anymore
I can't see you niggas
Get up on my level, get up on my level
Love don't live here anymore
I can't see you niggas, can't see you niggas, I can't see you niggas, can't see you niggas, oh I can't see you niggas
(Karma comes right back around and you'll get what you did to me)
And love don't live here anymore
I can't see you niggas
Karma comes right back around and you'll get what you did to me
And you'll get what you did to me
Karma comes right back around and you'll get what you did to me
I can't see you niggas (What you did to me)
Karma comes right back around and you'll get what you did to me
