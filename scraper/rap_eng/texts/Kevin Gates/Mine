(Intro: TK Kravitz)
(TK Kravitz)
(Nonstop)

(Chorus: TK Kravitz)
I can tell you miss me baby
I hear them talkin' but it don't phase me
I can still taste your lips all over mine
I can still taste your lips all over mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine

(Verse 1: TK Kravitz)
I can still taste your lips lil shawty (lil shawty)
Every bag you got, I bought it (I bought it)
I know you want me inside
Just like a bed, treat you right
Maybe you got too much pride
Maybe you got too much pride
I try not to fuck you girl
It feel like a magnet
Somethin tell me that I need you girl (I need)
Somethin tell me that I need you girl (I need)
I'm in love with that ass, what it look like?
Hit you with the dick and ask you what it hit like
Barry Bonds with it, I ain't calm with it
Yeah I got it wet, like a faucet hit it

(TK Kravitz & Kevin Gates)
I can tell you miss me baby
I hear them talkin' but it don't phase me
I can still taste your lips all over mine
I can still taste your lips all over mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine

(Verse 2: Kevin Gates)
(Know I was turnt up I was seein you, ya heard me?)
I took some L's in the game and had to step it up
Just had came home from jail now we catchin' up
Spent some bread on your nails while you freshen up
Love to get you undressed, why you dressin' up?
(All of your secrets will soon be disclosed)
All of your secrets will soon be disclosed
The faces you make when you gettin' this pole
You piss on this dick when I'm fuckin' you slow
You don't need to trip 'cause I got you we grown
My mouth killer lights and the light show is on
I'm laid on my back, when you ride I hold on
Don't want me to let loose inside you hold on

(TK Kravitz & Kevin Gates)
I can tell you miss me baby
I hear them talkin' but it don't phase me
I can still taste your lips all over mine
I can still taste your lips all over mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine
