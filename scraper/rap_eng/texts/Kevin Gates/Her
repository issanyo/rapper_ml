[Hook: Kevin Gates]
That bitch there got a booty on her
Mane that's a big booty bitch, I want her
That bitch there got a booty on her
Mane that's a big booty bitch, I want her
Fine ass, with yo fine ass, yo big fine ass, fine ass, with yo fine ass, look fine ass, yo big fine ass
Let a nigga get behind that
I ain't playing witcha, swear to God x3
For a big bag of money I be going hard

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates
Cuttin' up on the Hemi
Hellcat with the Hemi
Big booty with the titties
Ooh ooh you the sickest
Even got pretty nipples, the kind that make you wanna nibble
Polo drawers out of Dillard's, designer belt by the zipper
BreadWinner sweats with the slippers
Drunk man on the liquor
On the front porch with the hittas
With my engine in blowing killer
When I'm with ya bitch I won't kiss her
Mane what you mean she don't listen?
Say what you mean you don't feel it?
It probably mean your shit little

[Hook: Kevin Gates]

[Verse 2: Boobie Black]
Bitch I tell the truth, only truth, that's the truth
Big fine motherfucker, yea what it do
Small waistline, when she walk that ass jumping
Bitch I ain't frontin', I just wanna fuck you
Nigga I'll fuck your whole world up buckin'
I got the .50 caliber, nigga I ain't frontin'
Same nigga from the Magnolia Project
OG Boobie Black, real nigga with respect
