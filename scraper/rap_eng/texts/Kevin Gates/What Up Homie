[Verse 1]
They say we moving to fast, big deal-bite us
Other side of the class the slim chicks like us
Other side of the glass shooter windshield wiper
Now the tears on my side and you still can't wipe them
A lot of baby mamas hard to feed them from the pen
I'm a make it from this rapping I'm a feed them from the pen
You are the sum of equation when niggas don't keep it real
Now niggas telling on me cause never know how it feel
I swear the dope game just get so phony
Weight of the world say that it all fell on me
And the closest of the closest had they [?] on me
Sometimes I don't sleep and it been so lonely
Lot of time ride around with out the chrome on me
I'm tired of living would somebody put the chrome on me
But I got to stand strong cause of what I stand for
Life sentence ain't comprehend of what it stand for

[Hook]
(Be like what up homie)
I've been with you through the storm hope you know I miss you and I wish you hurry home
(What up homie)
Hard to touch you through the phone so I put together this letter and stuck in a song
(What up homie)
Eventually you will see I ain't forget about I'm just busy doing me
(I be like what up homie)
Eventually you will see never forget about you I'm just busy doing me

[Verse 2]
As your life unravels know I'm with you in the cuffs
I know you get to travel but it's different on the bus
I remember you and me sitting in the trap
Talking how you like bentleys and how you want to rap
Talking how you like you Christine and how you want her back
Her boyfriend got stupid, you caught him with a gat
Deep in the paint, shots high percentage
Rawest in the city, niggas not competition
Play your song over the phone, it's only steel
Riding in the s500 to Lauren Hill
The rain keep falling water dropping on my sleeves
The water like my problems trying to drop me to my knees
Can see me in the whip blowing killer behind the tint
But my girlfriend tripping we still behind on the rent
Thats when I told her everything I had a way of working out Pockets broker then my leg, hard to see it working out
