[Intro: Marcus Black]
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Marcus Black]
Oh that's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Oh that's my nigga, yeah that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Hey that's my nigga

[Verse 1: Marcus Black]
Hey that's my nigga, she's so solid
So I pay dollars, I pay homage
All she want from me is just to keep it honest
And don't ever let no bitch jump out of pocket
When I was down she held it down just like she promised
When I was broke she fucked me like I had them commas
I can never bring lil' baby no dishonor
That's on my soul, that's on my mama (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Marcus Black]
Oh that's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Oh that's my nigga, yeah that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Hey that's my nigga

[Verse 2: Marcus Black]
All my  fooly's love her , had the Gucci clutch her
She a movie in the bed, she keep that coochie bustin'
She got that Jamba Juice, she always keep the smoothie running
I'm in the studio feeling like Groovy Q or somethin'
If she say it I believe it, that's what happened
'Cause she ain't never lied to me or done no cappin'
When it come to baby, know I'm 'bout that action
I ain't got no pics and I don't get no passes, that's my nigga

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
You know I'm penitentiary rich, you know
Bitch puttin' three hundred on my books, you know
You know you my lil' nigga, retarded
Remember you blessed and consider yourself
You ain't look at me like I had my shit on myself
Took a lil' hit on the belt but I'm steppin', God help me
I'm in and I'm out of corrections
I'm tryna get radio play on a record
I hustle, I'm sellin', nobody respect it
I did a few shows in the studio heavy
But shawty was there for me, never no question
I wrecked my lil' car, was pushin' a bucket
She catchin' a bus, doin' that 'cause she love me
Come up from nothin', I started back hustlin'
I'm comin' in later, she don't do no fussin'
Niggas be fake, they pretending they love me
I follow my face, I said they don't do nothin'
I'm poured and I'm thuggin', I'm puttin' up numbers
It's gettin' disgusting, I'm 'bout to get ugly

[Chorus: Marcus Black]
Oh that's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Yeah that's my nigga, oh that's my nigga, ooh
That's my nigga, yeah that's my nigga, ooh
I ain't talking 'bout my partner, I'm talking 'bout my lil' boo
It's crazy how she the most loyal nigga in my crew
Hey that's my nigga
