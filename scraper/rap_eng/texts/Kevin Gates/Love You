[Intro]
I got a heart that's full of love
With so much love to give
But I'm saying though, I feel how you feel
Where we go from here?
I got a heart that's full of love
With so much love to give
Look, I ain't never been too hard for myself

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar
When the lights go down and you're looking around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you

[Verse 1]
She's a murderer, when I hurt it aches
She has an hourglass figure and a perfect waist
Breaking my feelings she contributes to the murder rate
I went to jail she dreamt it, from the symptoms I have no escape
This no facade Peter tange in my cigar
The way I move may be peculiar to people I come across
Stress, this confession forever you in my heart
Wish you the best, in whatever endeavors that you embark
Gates
I got a heart that's full of love with so much love to give
I often pictured us together married with some kids
Victim of a broken promise I know what it is
And all of your friends know I'm a gangster

[Bridge]
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
I pray that heaven comforts you, so you should be alright, alright

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar
When the lights go down and you're looking around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you

[Verse 2]
Making fake moves backwards (what that is), fatal attraction
I'll forever be your slave, I been caged in and captured
And the drugs don't really make the problem ever shrink
But they do release the endorphins that help me not to think
Suicide's been contemplated irrational way of thinking
Attach a brick to my ankle and throw me over the deep end
Weekend, sleep in, I don't go to clubs
Ask me any question and I might respond with shoulder shrugs
Connected for eternity when forces take control of us
Luca Brasi get it in, you should know what's up
Do this every time I'm the life of the party
Know its got a name but they don't know what to call me

[Bridge]
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
I pray that heaven comforts you, so you should be alright, alright

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar
When the lights go down and you're looking around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you
