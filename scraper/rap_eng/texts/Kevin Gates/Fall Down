[Intro: Moneybagg Yo]
Quit holdin' onto to that shit
Throw that shit up, we don't care nothin' about that
Yeah
Big Bagg checkin' in, nigga, let's go
Hey Rvssian
Huh, huh

[Chorus: Kevin Gates & Moneybagg Yo]
Small waist, her hair long
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Hey)
Hunnid bands on me got me lit right now (Got me litty)
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (No goin' back)
I need her name, no stripper name
I'm sittin' back, she entertain
She do a lot for a little change
She see the lights set off my chain
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (No goin' back)

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Hey, ooh, the way she twerkin' got me focused (Focused)
Throwin' cash, starin' at that ass
And I don't give a fuck if she notice (What she look like?)
Pretty thick, bad bitch, diggin' me 'cause I'm flashin' (Flashin')
Louis, Fenti clashin' (Mixin'), cash cannon blastin'
Kickin' it like the Feds came, you heard of the bread gang? (Yeah)
We hot as toast, what's up with your head gang? (Huh?)
When we do the damn thing (What?) You better not choke (Uh, uh)
I just met a freak ho out in Puerto Rico
Hit it right back like we need a sequel
Rubbin' on her cat now she call me Doctor Evil
Asshole naked in a YSL peacoat
Money fallin' down like I just tripped (Tripped)
Saucin' off the 'Gram, man I just drip
She in trouble, man give her the tip
A couple off ugh-ughs and your ah-ah's
Love when them lips suck on me like a ba-ba
Make the volcano erupt while we gettin' hotta

[Chorus: Kevin Gates & Moneybagg Yo]
Small waist, her hair long
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Hey)
Hunnid bands on me got me lit right now (Got me litty)
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (No goin' back)
I need her name, no stripper name
I'm sittin' back, she entertain
She do a lot for a little change
She see the lights set off my chain
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (No goin' back)

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Ask her, do she like workin' out?
To some audio
One, two, three, from the back we doin' cardio (For real)
Pardon my bluntness, pardon my lingo
Like bein' private, don't do people
Don't compare me to your old boyfriend
Really retarded, we are not equal
Walk in the club, when I saw you in here
I knew I had to have you, I'm seein' you watchin'
Married my hustle and I am not stoppin'
I'm walkin' around with a brick in my pocket
Deep in the paint, but I'm no Dennis Rodman
I look like a killer, you want me inside ya
I caught a few bodies that I don't acknowledge
My ultimate goal was to go back to college
I'm in the Porsche and I put it in throttle
What is your IG and why you don't model?
I'm lovin' your body, you shaped like a bottle
You 'posed to be somebody's, baby I'm honored
I love what you doin', collectin' your dollars
Leave with me, forget all your problems
Soft kisses all on your vagina
Picture me givin' you dick on an island

[Chorus: Kevin Gates & Moneybagg Yo]
Small waist, her hair long
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Hey)
Hunnid bands on me got me lit right now (Got me litty)
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (No goin' back)
I need her name, no stripper name
I'm sittin' back, she entertain
She do a lot for a little change
She see the lights set off my chain
Oh, make it rain and fall down (Down, down)
I throw it up, she throw it back
It's up there, no goin' back (Hey)
