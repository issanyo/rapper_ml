[Hook: Kevin Gates]
If you get in the way, I want to clean up brigade
Beat up your face
No surrender, me no run away
If you get in the way, I want to clean up brigade
Beat up your face
No surrender, me no run away

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Last time I checked, I wasn't soft on these streets
Bled and fought, win, lose, or draw on these streets
Rob a seven fifty, got taught on these streets
Open shopping, hotels
Serve raw on these streets
Jumps feel tough and the shot gun pop one
Wanted me a mouth-piece but Bow Wow's got one
Eatin' when they sleepin'
Feedin' my aggression
Ease when they be, watch them freeze under pressure
Lyrically inclined I post and represent
Shit no, sick flow
Throw some medicine
X-Macmilicon
Young, black militant
Cash on the stash god damn, magnificent

[Pre Bridge: x2]
Might as well sag my pants everywhere I go
You know I'mma show my ass everywhere I go

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
2002, close case
I shot him in the face (No surrender, me no run away)
I couldn't get at the nigga, so I made it my point to get at his bitch
Check me out, look
Up in sovereign when I saw you dancin'
Approach her from behind like do ya damn ting
She tellin' me she feelin my Jamaican accent
So I walked up by the leavy trying to break her back-in

[x2]
She pullin' on my dreads she call me Mr. Lova
I'm send me love to Shabba Ranks, she call me Mr. Lova

We're all going on a summer holiday
Hustle in the drow, we can run the holiday
We're all going on a summer holiday
Hustle in the drow, tryna run the holiday

[Pre Bridge: x2]
Might as well sag my pants everywhere I go
You know Ima show my ass everywhere I go
