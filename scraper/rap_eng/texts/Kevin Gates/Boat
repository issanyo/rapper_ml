[Intro: Chevy Woods]
That's all these niggas rap about is trappin'
A nigga been did that

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
Hunnit pack boy you ain't never seen a hunnit
Hunnit pack boy you ain't never seen a hunnit
If you ain't never been a boss a lot of work got frontin
Out of town full of duffle bag full of that dope
And a nigga bad hand for car money now a nigga need a boat

I need, I need a I need a boat
I need a boat, I need a boat, I need a boat
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a boat
I need a boat, I need a boat

[Verse 1: Chevy Woods]
Double knock at the door that's the code to the trap house
Been a junkie bout an hour, used to let me use the crib thats a trap out
I done been did all that shit niggas rap about
Drop a bag when you hear a motherfucker click boom get you ragged out
I need a hood with some cribs and some motherfucking OG's
Tap, tap what the fuck? 5 shots in your chest if you owe me
Better keep it ding round here, dirty money try and clean round here
Bullets cold ding round here, make her suck a nigga lean round here
Scared for my hood, tell me what you pussy niggas even need round here
I be with good shooters they don't even need a motherfucking bean round here
48 hunnit I done seen so many niggas bleed round here
Streets sleepin' go brrrrrr get a pussy nigga clean round here

[Hook: Chevy Woods]

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
What up? Cut up? I don't get tired
Out of town nigga bout to pull up on a taxi
Make a left on East Buchanan, make a left on Carolina
23, 29 transaction
What you tryna get? Need a spliff? Action
18 O's, 500 4 grams
Weigh it on the scale only that without the bag
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the bag
Real street nigga, I ain't ever seen a hunnit
Where the clique house be, you would think I have a hunnit
Interstate, enter state, now we go and get it
Mustard on the yellow before you stuff it in the vender
Connect trying to bring them I was buying 2 minutes
Slow down find another blood and he coming with it
I'ma cut them up and ima test them right infront of you
Put them gloves on before I even see the bundle
Finger press a mother fucker nigga never fondle
Making sure a fishscale, I don't sell all base but I could make it all
Shake, especially in the drought
Hit me with the re-compress, you gon have to kill me taking food out my kid mouth
Maybe you don't feel me I'ma die bout respect nigga you really seen me
A hunnit pound of green in a 18 [?]
I only sell dope, told Lito come and get it

[Hook: Chevy Woods]

[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
Start the car on you niggas I don't even need keys
Two hundred on the dash, you a hunnit nigga so round twice your speed
Hit a nigga with the pack, he don't bring nothing back then you know what it is
White clean off the mac if you know where you stay it ain't safe round here
I see the jealously all in your eyes nigga
Heres a table with about 4 pies nigga
Pour killas, Im the truth you a lie nigga
If he ain't table then you know he ain't mine nigga
48 hunnit
I was on tour some real break out on the road
And a bitch ass nigga hit my spot for about a quater bird
I ain't even trip that come with the gang
Now what thats worth its all in my chain

[Hook: Chevy Woods]
