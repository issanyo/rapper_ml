[Intro: D Bo & Kevin Gates]
Whhaaat?
D Bo
Raw, uncut, no stains, nigga
Shit real 'round my way, R.I.P the dawg nigga, you hear me?
"Solid" way more than a word to me, it's a lifestyle, ya heard me?
All the way from Fall Creek, baby
Rest in peace to all the real, free the solid, ya hear me
I don't get tired

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Back to the fridge and the freezer facin' the gas stove
Put glass at the colleges, makin' sure the gat close
Fresh box of soda, shake it, makin' sure it ain't no clumps
Arbys ain't what you want, fish scale with extra chumps
Water, wrist game Dasani, won't fold, no origami
I never spoke, came home a legend, grindin', now I'm shinin'
Snakes envy all around me, had to switch up my climate
Keep it a thousand, then if not, most likely dyin' 'bout it

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
Droppin' ice in the Pyrex, and watch it come back solid
Servin' raw, provide product, while in my environment
Niggas like re-compressed dope, man they ain't rockin' solid
Back-stab you for a hoe, and call [?]

[Chorus: Lil E]
These niggas ain't solid (No-ooh-o)
It ain't all about who is poppin' (No-ooh-o)
If you a killer then control it, ain't nobody supposed to know it
'Cause these niggas ain't solid (No-ooh-o)
It ain't all about who is poppin' (Oh, no it ain't, No-ooh-o)
If you a killer then control it (Control, control, control, control)
Ain't nobody supposed to know it

[Verse 2: D Bo]
On some one-hundred and ten shit (One hundred)
I take everything personal when handling business
If that's your nigga, don't let him short ya', 'cause he gon' feel like He ain't gotta pay, and that type of shit fuck up friendships
Speakin' of friendships, fuck 'em (Fuck 'em)
Answer this, my nigga crossed me, should I bust him?
His momma love me, plus his kids call me uncle
We been on missions, we was side-by-side bustin' (Bop-bop-bop)
They say love is blind, I ain't see the same side of lovin'
He ran a whole play down to his old lady, how can I trust him?
My back to the wall, two pistols wit' extended clips when I'm Hustlin', they questioned me about murder, stick to the code, I Don't know nothin', keep my distance from these niggas 'cause These

[Chorus: Lil E & D Bo]
These niggas ain't solid (No-ooh-o)
These niggas ain't
It ain't all about who is poppin' (No-ooh-o)
If you a killer then control it, ain't nobody supposed to know it
'Cause these niggas ain't solid (These niggas ain't)
It ain't all about who is poppin' (Oh no it ain't, no-ooh-o)
If you a killer then control it (Control, control, control, control)
Ain't nobody supposed to know it
(Ain't no-one supposed to know)

[Verse 3: Lil E]
Can't no nigga tell me nothin' when I'm clutchin', listen
It's 'bout far few in between, who I call for assistance
But he supposed to be a dawg, we broke bread, we fucked brauds
See this shit was all good about a week ago
When he ain't had shit, don't no solid niggas speak in past-tense that shit through
I told them niggas fuck em

[Chorus: Lil E]
These niggas ain't solid (No-ooh-o)
It ain't all about who is poppin' (No-ooh-o)
If you a killer then control it, ain't nobody supposed to know it
'Cause these niggas ain't solid (No-ooh-o)
It ain't all about who is poppin' (Oh no it ain't)
If you a killer then control it, ain't nobody supposed to know it

[Outro: Lil E]
