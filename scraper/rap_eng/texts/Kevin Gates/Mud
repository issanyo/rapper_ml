24 Hours, nigga, 7 days a week
Me, I don't get tired, I let you other niggas sleep
Turn up for that check and yeah I get it out the streets
Hustle like I'm starving going hard, I gotta eat
I get it out the mud, yeah, yeah
I get it out the mud, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch how I break my wrist
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip
I'm all about my chips
I get it out the mud yeah, yeah
I get it out the mud yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch how I break my wrist
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip
I'm all about my chips
I get it out the mud
Turn up in 2 seconds
Get it with music and cope when I'm stretching
Across the street under a bando
And here with your ho, could get her to go fetch it (Here boy)
On the scale, but I call her the ruler
And that's what I'm using my method to measure
Got her jumping up out of the party
My clique-ity clucking surrounding my property
I meant to say my clientickity
Numbers official retickity
Out the mud, nobody did shit for me
Arrogant often I'm bigity
All about money, like what done got into me
Breaking down bricks and we blowing good grigity?
Say you ain't feeling me, outta try killing me
Neighborhood love me, it's hard to get rid of me
My baby mothers are sick of me
I put that dick on 'em now they ridiculously
Saying, that when I don't come in I'm with a freak bitch
I've been chasing my paper religiously
I'm really in the street, others pretend to be
Let me get off of my grind then they sellin' me
No one repeatedly coming and getting me out the mud nigga
I'm the epitome
24 Hours, nigga, 7 days a week
Me, I don't get tired, I let you other niggas sleep
Turn up for that check and yeah I get it out the streets
Hustle like I'm starving going hard, I gotta eat
I get it out the mud, yeah, yeah
I get it out the mud, yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch how I break my wrist
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip
I'm all about my chips
I get it out the mud yeah, yeah
I get it out the mud yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch how I break my wrist
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip
I'm all about my chips
I get it out the mud
Money coming, my money gotta flip it
I ain't waiting on nobody, I'mma go get it
I ain't tripping on a nigga, I'm a gorilla
Somebody take something from me, I'm gonna go kill 'em
Trap with my heart and I'm serving out the window
Barely balled up, with a curtain on the window
Face card worth a lot of bands in the hood
Had to leave the dice game, got a bond out Fooz
Sunday coming up, pull the cars out
Look, another 20 grand, but my girl called me
Put bail, what the hell got all y'all shook
Poo hit the line in the drop
Blowing drank then take him to the road
Pulling up, getting it, ? Sick man
Drop no whip, and a nigga gon' vouch (vouch)
Another 4K just stuffed in the couch
Promise I ain't tryna swag, I just got a lot of that
Anybody try me, I'mma put 'em in a body bag
Follow that, copy that, pounds in the garbage bag
Backed in the bank, y'all leaving after driving that
Call 'em back Call 'em back, chill, no falling back
Quicker than I got it, then I done ran out of that
? Shittin harder than the bitch ?
