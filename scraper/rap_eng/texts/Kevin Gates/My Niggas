[Gates Speaking]
Glock staying cocked
Aim, Squeeze
Dive in there and get 'em

[Intro]
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolut
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolut

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Gates hit the lobby of your favorite hotel, they get stupid
Dead game, come equipped with a chain and 10 shooters
Anything move? Report it he be a victim
Oh he BWA, he straight, a breadwinner
My trap, open with crack like the pocket on a bus
My bread wrapped in stacks like I got it off a truck
What type of nigga tote a pipe, ignite in it in a bust
I put that on my life, I'mma bite a million bucks
My dog, eat steak, gotta feed me cake
I get payed for spittin' like I'm T.D. Jakes
Tell the bartender, bartender send over the hard liquor
Money like a poker parade, not a card with us
Handshakin', fan basin', hosted by the tan sadist
Me? I'm a G, blow weed like a plantation
My nigga birthday, tell the stripper light the candles
Taylor made gator suede, [?]

[Chorus]
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolut
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolute
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
My niggas by the picture booth, a photo session
Purchase every color collar in the Polo section
I mean, what kind of nigga take trips out of town
Find a freak, bring her back, let the click dick her down
Movie after movie, run game on the bitch
Call Vick "work ya' magic, run train on the bitch"
You know how this thing go
Money longer than train smoke
Out in front the club, them triggers will make ya brain poke
Give us what we came for, bring it in what we aim for
My niggas stay fresh, don't know how to fuck with plain clothes
Now we ride suicide, pro handle, dope crease
Goin' to the Lakers game, buying out the floor seats
Fiend with a team, with jerseys and fitteds
Worried with security, they nervous, a sickness
I heard of them niggas, I served by the bitches
Too solid and they talking? We'll murder the witness

[Chorus]
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolut
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolute
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
I move with dope movers, miniature MAK-90's
Relax in the Matra, I trap, we read dollars
Any altercation, the strap will freeze violence
Lit up on the strip, we strike, we see sirens
Street where they stuff it fast
Pump heat, bust and blast
Black leather gloves, ski mask, and a duffel bag
They gon' have to handle us
Don't know how to handle us
Get a bad vibe, 50 shots to the [?]
Smolder jackers, Ruger's and automatics
Shooter's say "is ya' stupid? Them dudes got a lot of swagger"
Word on percentages, Bird got a lot of talent
Nerve of the news camera, them boys grip 2 hammers
Grab on a new felon? they smashin' ya new new balance
Im back, 10 stacks, and with crack we do magic
Place where your [?] came
Probably made chump change
Arsenal weaponry, Gates got a gun range

[Chorus]
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolut
What kind of nigga make a nigga move when they come through?
Act a fool when they come through on Grey Goose and Absolute
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, my niggas, don't you fuck with my niggas
