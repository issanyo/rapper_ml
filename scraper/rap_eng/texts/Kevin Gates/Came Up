[Chorus]
Young nigga hold a rock for the family
Been a long time, hope they understandin' me
I walked a hundred thousand miles, long way from home
Miss my niggas, some dead, some ain't comin' home
Nigga came up, I done came up
Plottin' on them billions
Nigga came up, I done came up
Trap jumpin' off the hinges

[Verse 1]
Arrogant face, no one know what I'm faced
I ain't runnin' from court, I'ma face 'em
Tryna blow with this rap, gotta make it
Fuck the fame, it's the paper I'm chasin'
I just wanna shine
When the rap game turned their back on me
Tried to blackball me, no cosigns
Many major artists said, "Fuck that," kept rollin'
Gave DJ Khaled one of my CDs
He was actin' like he ain't know me
Received no fundin' from the label
Two strikes against me, no room for flakin'
Don't sell dope, just loud now
And I only serve a few niggas
Choppin' game with the Cali plug
They love me 'cause I'm consistent

[Chorus]
Young nigga hold a rock for the family
Been a long time, hope they understandin' me
I walked a hundred thousand miles, long way from home
Miss my niggas, some dead, some ain't comin' home
Nigga came up, I done came up
Plottin' on them billions
Nigga came up, I done came up
Trap jumpin' off the hinges

[Verse 2]
Went behind my back, got at my connect
I ain't trip on it, stayed silent
Lito say he need to speak to me
Got some gangsta shit to run by me
Then I hear a song with that nigga sayin'
Pussy already in the red
Fuck my goons, no spendin' bread
Seen dude, I was by myself
Spoke to me, then he turned his head
Boy a bitch like I fuckin' said
Gotta write Gucci, tell him hold his head
Industry niggas'll smile in your face
No chemistry with you, no smilin' for Gates
Bread winner like Nike
Air Force 1s strapped tightly
Just do it if you don't like me, pussy

[Chorus]
Young nigga hold a rock for the family
Been a long time, hope they understandin' me
I walked a hundred thousand miles, long way from home
Miss my niggas, some dead, some ain't comin' home
Nigga came up, I done came up
Plottin' on them billions
Nigga came up, I done came up
Trap jumpin' off the hinges
