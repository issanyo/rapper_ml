[Hook]
I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no bitch that I can't hit, don't know no chick that say no
Don't know no chips that I can't get, don't know no whip I can't own
Shit, I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no ugly bitches
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
Don't know no bitch niggas
There's some things I don't know

[Verse 1]
Don't know nobody leaning harder, Phantom bought while out in Florida
Condo out in Georgia, my little daughter diamonds water
Don't know nobody who ain't retarded
Know there's a name, don't know what to call it
Actavis flowing like a faucet, 40's my precaution
Don't know who can't afford to take a trip when they get bored
Keep they chick in Michael Kors, wake up in designer stores
Infiniti trucks be pulling up, Louis luggage on the floor
Ain't being searched by TSA, private jets we finna board

[Hook]
I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no bitch that I can't hit, don't know no chick that say no
Don't know no chips that I can't get, don't know no whip I can't own
Shit, I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no ugly bitches
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
Don't know no bitch niggas
There's some things I don't know

[Verse 2]
This new whip I bought is awesome
Don't know how the fuck I bought it
High speed chase, patrol behind me
Don't know how the fuck I lost them
I say skiiirt, vroom, head on collision
Don't know how I'm talking
Crashed with a Jeep rendered parapalegic well I barely can see and don't know how I'm walking
Don't know a parrot
Polly be talking your shawty be gawking
She stalling, she falling
Don't know why she's talking or why she be calling
Protecting your momma's house, Macaulay Culkin
Rappers that don't know I'm right on their heels
Don't know how to party, but I'm going in
While they had a party I'm stacking my ins
Exit in a rental, come back in a Benz
I got it

[Hook]
I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no bitch that I can't hit, don't know no chick that say no
Don't know no chips that I can't get, don't know no whip I can't own
Shit, I know a lot, but there's some things I dont know
Don't know no ugly bitches
Don't know no broke niggas
Don't know no snitch niggas
Don't know no bitch niggas
There's some things I don't know
