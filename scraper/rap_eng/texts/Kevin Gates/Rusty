Picking Up My Old Ways
Dust Myself Off I Got Rusty, Babe

Dust Myself Off I Got Rusty,Babe

[Verse 1:]
It's A Quarter 'Till Nine
I'm Feeling Lost
Done Got My Wings
Now She Gone Call
Talking 'Bout You Tryna Fuck
Tryna Make Love, Do Some More Drugs
Really As Long As You Ride This Pony
I'mma Be Nice
So I Can Go Ahead And Beat That Pussy Up
No Ray Rice (yeah)
Spend The Night
Gone In The Morning
Do It Tomorrow
This Time Bring Morgan
( This Time Bring Morgan)

[Verse 2:]
I Was In The Booth
When I Got The Call
Told Me I Was A Player
Got To Many Broads
Got To Many Phones
No Kevin Gates
I Leave Ass Alone
Just Cause (Just Cause)
I'm On Some Other Shit
Sound Like A Greatest Hits
Who Needs Benefits
When Everyday I Kill That Shit
Live That Shit
Doesn't Really Matter
Kill My Sorrows and Pain
With A Line of 'Caine
Fucking For Free Eases Everything
Love (Love)
