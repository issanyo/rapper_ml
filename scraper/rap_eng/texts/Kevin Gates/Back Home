[Chorus]
Back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
I said I’m back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
Before I was gone

[Verse 1]
Back like I never went
Back to my residence
Exit out the drought
Southside - I’m the president
Breadwinner mafia don’t like it
We eatin' up
Need an encyclopedia mean
I’m reading can’t read enough
Made a fire extinguisher
Squeeze in front of the media
When the carbon spark
They talk as if they swallowing helium
Used to drop whitey, cook beige
I’s a lunatic - went from watching movies
With floosies to eating tuna fish
Lust for thoughts masturbating
Stainless steel shitter
Lotta jailhouse visits
Buying barker shower slippers
I was taught, Lord Jesus
That prayer change things
All I gotta do it believe
And watch thangs change
And that’s when the game changed
I got caught up in the wrap around
AK 47 fifty shots out the wrap around
Type of shit I rap about
Everythang I live and did
Fresh up out the clink
Screamin HUH - put that on the rib

[Chorus]
Back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
I said I’m back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
Before I was gone

[Verse 2]
It’s the nigga Luca Brasi
I thug in the streets
Out the mud - push drugs
Put blood in the streets
How’s a mother supposed to feel
When her older son is a killer
Coworkers with the mother
Her older son was the victim
In a crime field violence spill
They say time heal
If that’s the case must be a mistake
Still, I cried tears
Joy Frazier God be with his lady
He got nine years
Focus on your rap
Will have your people living good
I’m being tangled with entrapment
Tryin to keep it in your hood
Praying for lil' Chris life stressing him out
God, please be with B
Ain’t no stretchin' a line
Last week on 15 they tried X’n him out
But that’s what blessins about
Being reckless allowed
Do the careless operation
Get the Tec in your mouth
Me and Nuk in the blue and white
Hallway thuggin' the raw way altercate
Make em broad day somethin’

[Chorus]
Back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
I said I’m back on the grind
Back on my toes
When they let me out I’m gone
I’ve been down for too long
But now I’m coming home
Better than I was before
Before I was gone
