Verse 2: Kevin Gates

Air Nike get long pockets, grinding rocket swish

Diamonds dancing, my cologne got ‘em tryna catch their breath

They get cardiac arrest when they see the Cartier
Bling’ll blind you, glancing without glasses, vision get impaired
80’s baby, flavor, kitchen table, sticking to the script

Sold a lock and drop it straight to gangsters, I don’t want to whip
Trap beating, say he need a fix, watch out, break the wrist
Arm & Hammer going hammer time, too legit to quit
Black and white cells, let’s just say my clientele a panda
Thumbing through it, only run it up to fuck up with a dancer
Cash off the slab, junkies tryna flag me all in traffic
Gotta blast, moonwalking, Michael Jackson walking backwards
