[Hook: Scrilla]
Codeine'll have you lazy
In the kitchen goin' crazy
Tryna dodge my old lady
She gon' drive a nigga crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, whip-whippin' up a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, a, a-a-a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby

[Verse 1: Chedda Da Connect]
Had to whip the 36
Real street nigga who ain't scared to sell shit
Trappin' is my hobby, watch me hit it with the wrist
Take it all off, that's what I told your bitch
(I'm whippin' up a baby)
Cocaine'll have you lazy
Runnin' down Ocean Drive, I can't feel my face
Dodged my old lady cause the bitch goin' crazy
I just dropped a stiff 80 on a new Mercedes (cash stacks)

[Hook: Scrilla]
Codeine'll have you lazy
In the kitchen goin' crazy
Tryna dodge my old lady
She gon' drive a nigga crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, whip-whippin' up a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, a, a-a-a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Straight drop be the mob
'Fore I whip dope, I'ma die
Two zaps come and bag 60 grams
I ain't never jump 85
Breadwinner, stand up guy
No wrist, all my drops off
Mailed it to the oil, hit it with the water
Hang up in his face, watch he go to callin'
Banger on the waist, I ain't even talkin'
Walkin' in the mall, they know I'm retarded
Hit the Louis store, watch I go to ballin'
Never love a bitch, I can love my daughter
I'm what chicks dig, I'm not even bothered
You too immature, I can't be your father
Don't wanna lie but do your body like I work comin' out of Florida

[Hook: Scrilla]
Codeine'll have you lazy
In the kitchen goin' crazy
Tryna dodge my old lady
She gon' drive a nigga crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, whip-whippin' up a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, a, a-a-a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby

[Verse 3: Chedda Da Connect]
Have it stankin' up the kitchen
Clear my bitch freezer, got a couple pounds of midget
I've been catchin' plays all night through my city
I be in the trap house with them pistols
I'm in that new Mercedes, with my baby
(What you doin' with your freak?)
In the kitchen like the 80s
I keep them trey pounds, like Katy
(8 ball, 8 ball)
Got fiends goin' crazy

[Hook: Scrilla]
Codeine'll have you lazy
In the kitchen goin' crazy
Tryna dodge my old lady
She gon' drive a nigga crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, whip-whippin' up a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby, a, a-a-a baby
In the kitchen goin' crazy
I'm whippin' up a baby
