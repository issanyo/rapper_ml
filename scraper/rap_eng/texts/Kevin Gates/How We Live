[Intro]
(?) Kevin Gates (?)
I got it out the, on the muscle
On the muscle
You know the (?) where I live

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Stay down till you come up in the game nigga now we action
Deep disdainment for entertainment, lights, cameras, action
I could kill you with the love but that was just a fraction
Tend to click out on my drugs, music is my passion
Change my bad habits all my partnas say I'm funny actin'
Call it coordinated swag, nasty like me everybody askin'
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Bitches shootin' crosses from behind the bifocals
They don't know I caught it
Bitch I'm Vicked out
Dick game real kosher I be smokin' on the Marley
I don't want no money nigga you ain't had a friend like Kevin
Walk your nigga down, bust him up, then I went to jail nigga no tellin'
Convicted felon really co-sellin'
Posed to be up in somebody college
Dream was to meet Don King
Next Muhammad with the boxing
I'm a Muslim I don't try to hide it (Allahu Akbar)
I'm a killer, I done caught a body
Rap game legend, I forgot it
Oh my bad, there go Luca Brasi
Lil one dead, lil one tried to rob me
Hit me leg, wrestled for the raw
Oxycotton fetish for the boy
I'ma take my chances, I'm a dog
Aston Martin keep on gon' off
Jump the bitch, I love you, I'm on call
Industry (?) switch up on a broad
Kevin Gates okay, signing off

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Stay down till you come up in the game nigga now we action
Deep disdainment for entertainment, lights, cameras, action
I could kill you with the love but that was just a fraction
Tend to click out on my drugs, music is my passion
Change my bad habits all my partnas say I'm funny actin'
Call it coordinated swag, nasty like me everybody askin'
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live

[Verse 2: Yung Blaze]
No they don't get it how we live
In the kitchen whip it till it's pale
Bitch we started from the bottom
Now we headed toward the hills
Bitch you know I'm bout that action
I ain't never been with actin'
If I love you then I love you
I'ma love you with a passion
Brandon start changin' my ways
How I'm thinkin' the shit I be doin' they doin' for me
Had to start changin' my ways how I'm thinkin'
How they do it for me
All praise gotta go to God
You ain't gotta tell me bitch I'm raw
Dope good (?) goin' off
8 feet they goin' for the sauce
Who's swag super duper nasty
Shooters with me, everybody actin'
In the streets clenching' on the ratchet
Catch 'em broad day and let 'em have it
Niggas really pussy, I be laughin'
Bitch I'm really livin' what I'm rappin'
Niggas mad, never been a factor
I could see 'em hatin', what's the matter?

[Hook: Kevin Gates]

Call it coordinated swag, nasty like me everybody askin'
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live
They ain't come up how we live, they don't get it how we live
