(Hook)
I got mustard in the kitchen
In the Pyrex I do magic
Activis in soda
Similac in pampers
Don’t pull up when I say pull up
This play just might get cancelled
Drop soft and turn it solid
Jakes call me Austin Powers
My plug gave me that mojo
Now watch me work my mojo
My plug gave me that mojo
Now they come stamped like designer
My plug, Got me turning up!
My plug, I’m turning up!

(Verse)
Hold up, Hold up
Got it out the mud and I do it with the drugs
Pour up, Slow up, Pour up
Drought running out what I up recombust
Caught coming up I was catchin a bus
Bitch I really want really don’t give a fuck
Dressing bummy they teasing me in school
Hair never cut only came for the lunch
One day all that changed
Bought a vert blew out the brains
Yo ho tryina pick my brain
How the fuck he got all that change?
I’m a Gangster!
Rockin designer frames
Bond jumping had to pawn something
Fire arm clutching no bond money
Stack paper made sacrifices
White on white my car’s custom
My arm ugly won’t barrow nothin
No sleep fuck it just yawn for me
Still woke where I deal dope
Burglar bars on my trap house
Jennifer, Miss Air Mattress?
Slow stroke til she tap out

(Hook)
I got mustard in the kitchen
In the Pyrex I do magic
Activis in soda
Similac in pampers
Don’t pull up when I say pull up
This play just might get cancelled
Drop soft and turn it solid
Jakes call me Austin Powers
My plug gave me that mojo
Now watch me work my mojo
My plug gave me that mojo
Now they come stamped like designer
My plug, Got me turning up!
My plug, I’m turning up!
