Shit that I'm dealing with as of lately make regular people crazy
Accepting of kind gestures then later they'll want a favor
Lames in the dead lane saw I was destined for greatness
Everybody runs games, just peep it don't let them game you
Now give them what they expect they all find a reason to hate you
Walked away from salty, fuck niggas and kept it gangsta
Wouldn't mention a name when I spoke about situations
Ask god to see the world now I'm always on a vacation
Nobody saying Gates, don't turn your back on the hood
Turn your back they talk bad, they want you back in the hood
Southside, I saw a lot of progression, shout out to Vic
That other guy driving the Audi try sabotaging careers
Picture perfect working on something that ain't need to be fixed
Throwing a lot of crosses between the top and the artist
It's the same reason that me and my father haven't been talking
Loud mouth a rat when your conversation recorded
Nigga, don't you know I got niggas that clear your corner?
Everybody tuck their tail but nobody left in your corner
Freak for attention? I'd rather not being mentioned
Money stacked up, everyone I love out of prison
Marijuana, bathe, and grapes and Promethazine while I kick it
Panoramic roof and AMG Benz, no tinted windows
Sea salt scrubs, body massages ended with facials
The hottest club out in Canada bottle service at tables
BWA the strongest name where I'm stationed
Pray the soldiers all return home safe from where they stationed
Long hair, indigo eyes my Anastasia
Blind to the criminal mind, bae I could lace you
Took a hit or two but now drug dealing my occupation
Walked out on the biggest label, bought a brick and I sold it in Houston
Vanda took the charge, freed our neck from the nooses
God put me in position, don't ever confuse it
Out the dick of the Glock with the paper tags
Louis Vuitton, ER luggage, I paid for that
With Mayweather out in Vegas where the lights are overrated
When you broke and money come at you easy to be persuaded
Niggas give me stale faces no matter how much I gave them
Knowing if we switched positions, he wouldn't do an exchange
Wise men change and fools they stay the same then
Break all rules, follow your heart
If half of you had to chose you wouldn't know where to start
Bad vibes and company falling back unreluctantly
Fuck that, removing myself abruptly
The world too large to be letting somebody bump me
Make a scene bumping yo gum, watch I up it and go to dumping
Weak niggas insecure and get loud when they feel uncomfy
Yeah, come on
See it when it's fake, I won't play the game that you playing
Causing a disturbance, he want somebody to save him
Sometime I get perturbant, I entertain when it's flagrant
Mental on point you know I'm something amazing
Said it to remind myself positivity equals growth
Knowledge provided, but only to those who need to know
Having sleep disorder when thinking of Letha daughter
Could text and tell her I miss her
But fuck it, don't need to call her
The chick who I'm with be so uptight and shit
Always in her feelings for all type of shit
Sometime I feel I compromise, what have I become?
Thinking about what would have happened back when we was having fun
Talking in the trap and exhaling killa from my lungs
Everybody strapped, you got a gun-- I got a gun
Ruby Tuesday everyday, place an order, here we come
Only thing I ever hated was being restricted roam free
No restrictions, weight of the world, deadlift
Got everything I ever wanted with no one to share it with, deadlift
Got everything I ever wanted with no one to share it with
