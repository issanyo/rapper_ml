[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah, look, acting all sadity when a nigga in your city
Fame going to her head, thankful I ain't buy them titties
And I don't pillow talk with a hoe, that's a no no
In the morning, shaderoom, she be telling all your business
And now I got a couple chickens that I'm flying out the coop
Got some niggas that can fight, got some killers that can shoot
And bitches all on my 'gram, I'm trying make 100 million
Got bitches on top of bitches, I'm stacking 'em to the ceiling
Always a nigga tryna hate on me
And every time we pull a burner on 'em, they want peace
Bad bitches see the ice, they wanna skate on me
I hit the G with my D, now she won't leave
But I don't trip, I just let her stay and sip codeine
You know she can give me head but she can't smoke my weed
In that penthouse suite, I'm the man with the models
And we don't fuck with you nigga, we know you telling your partners

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 2: YoungBlacc]
Look, look, now these bitches wanna show's up
Cause they see me on the road and I'm jolled up
And all these bitches on my line like they know us
But I don't want that pussy, I'ma let the crew fuck you up
She so with it, my bitch bad, she gon' get it
Her lil sister, she thick now, get those digits
This money coming so quick now, need more spinach
We turn a bitch to a bust down if Chris hit it
And I ain't never 'bout to save no bitch
But if she bringing back money, we gon' all get rich
I need a new whip, new chain, talking 'bout the rap game
Keep the bitch tiptoes down, I'm speaking facts mane
And you ain't never 'bout to break my niggas
And all this money, I'm about to fresh to death my bitch
This the west coast, trap game, hit 'em on the crack cane
Spending young money and shit, call me Mack Maine

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 3: Young Lo]
Look, 'fore she used to be a solid bitch, but now she fucking with my tolerance
Like I ain't the nigga that's bringing dollars in
Took me from that regular life to living extravagant
Now you wanna flex on a nigga like you the baddest bitch
OHB, that's out of here bitch, I got some new freaks
Porsche 9/11, sitting pretty on the new feet
Two get fucked for an hour then let the crew skeet
Cruising, got 4 on the way while I got 2 suites
Black nigga in white linen with white women
And I ain't tripping, I like women that like women
Ooh baby, they all losing be like women
If I kill the pussy baby, that's a life sentence
Praying light, that's night vision
High-Tec, yeah I like sipping
Sold dope for them gold ropes, I like pitching
Whipping the block in 4 pots, this my kitchen, fuck with us

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
Big buck, bitch teeth crooked, and I ain't let her fuck
I ain't paying for the Uber, never told her that I love her
Kick her out man, every night she go and get her brother
Locked up with the reds, you know she watch a nigga fuck
Dog, I go hard, I am already a boss
On the plane slinging Rolls, I am already a boss
I be solo in the game, I be whipping up a Range
Name's holy wait, kick and fly conversation
Don't complain in the game, I ain't doing no complaining
He don't wanna front it, I'ma take it when I'm aiming
Move real cool, handle business like a gangster
Shoes on the bed, that's a lion to the jags
I be working out, wearing slay ups doing reps
Like the bench press, kill and stand on your chest
No one came in, flip for another set
She recertified, real nigga whip the stack

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We always fussing and arguing, then we kiss and make up
And every time I go out with my homies, I'ma have the party lit, going way up
But why you acting so surprised? I gave you my heart, girl I put it right in front of you
Socialize, now we in the club tryna socialize
