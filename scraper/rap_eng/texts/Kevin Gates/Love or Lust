[Chorus]
Could it be love or is it lust?
The way you make me feel swear I’ll never give you up
Feelings getting mad you say it’s about trust
Hard to deal with confidential, I feel it’s about us
Okay you heard them in the mafia but only if you, (yeah only if you)
Telling you the truth will probably only confuse you
Thinking you’re beautiful and I don’t wanna lose you

[Verse 1]
Candles by the side of the bathtub, we both naked
Place your legs over my shoulders, we both [?]
Love when I do it like this, we both shaking
Got this fantasy fulfilled man, we both racing
Exchanging fuck faces, while I touch places
Spit on her pussy from behind while we love making
Excuse me for being rude, I meant [?]
Slap that ass, got percussion like a drum base
Fuck you like a slut, treat you like a young lady
Penetrate, hyperventilate, [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
When you tell me you love me I feel it’s only a façade
If you ask me a question you probably won’t get a response
But I look at you different and I never mean to belittle you
Your nigga’s a creep I don’t see a reason for hitting you
I want to go kill him but I really feel like he’s pitiful
(I want to go kill him but I really feel like he’s pitiful)

[Chorus]
Could it be love or is it lust?
The way you make me feel swear I’ll never give you up
Feelings getting mad you say it’s about trust
Hard to deal with confidential, I feel it’s about us
Okay you heard them in the mafia but only if you, (yeah only if you)
Telling you the truth will probably only confuse you
Thinking you’re beautiful and I don’t wanna lose you

[Verse 2]
Every weekend you get off and spend it out of town
Last week we had a threesome in the lava lounge
Infatuated, you’re the shit in your designer blouse
Grabbing on your hips, bit your lip when you got aroused
Raised eyebrows, screaming Gates out loud
When we through, we watch a movie, how does takeout sound?
Shopping though the [?], purchased a sweater
Houston Galleria, [?] collation
The nerve, while you stressing over [?] I be fetching
Room service serves hors d’oeuvres [?]
Orgasms won’t happen, unheard of with Kevin
[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
When you tell me you love me I feel it’s only a facade
If you ask me a question you probably won’t get a response
But still, in the morning I give you kisses on the cheek
Flight leaving tomorrow so I won’t see you for a week

[Chorus]
Could it be love or is it lust? (all mine)
The way you make me feel swear I’ll never give you up (all mine)
Feelings getting mad you say it’s about trust (all mine)
Hard to deal with confidential, I feel it’s about us (all mine)
Okay you heard them in the mafia but only if you, (yeah only if you)
Telling you the truth will probably only confuse you
Thinking you’re beautiful and I don’t wanna lose you

[Outro]
She’s all mine
She’s all mine
Yeah, nigga she just loves me
She’s all mine
She’s all mine
