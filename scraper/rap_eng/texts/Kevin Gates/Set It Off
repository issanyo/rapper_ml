Paper thin patience, not a basketball player
I'm loved for this talent may never play for the lakers
Strategizing forced entry, armed robbery as of stated
We was pulling capers, Protecting your belongings pistol rape you leave you naked
Abella praying daily for protection of her baby
In the race for the change, showing no signs of me changing
I wanna be like the niggas in the whips taking vacations
Abandon project buildings got my weight up in the vacants
Cheap numbers dope wack, customers complaining
Orange jumper metal shackles, shit that come with slanging
Wooo here come the dawgs
Don't come from underneath the house we ain't gone call em off
Torn pants pepper sprayed as I fought em off
Im a gorilla Im a vet in the court of law
I went to war watched the coroners they haul em off
Asking questions never answered, ouuu im in my thoughts
I saw my flaws, one day IÂ´ll be better
Washing my draws in the toilet, scared to open letters
Might get the news, my mamma dead my ole lady done left me
Full speed for the cheese, kill all my vendettas
Fuck your Ruger 9 nigga this is a Baretta
My heart turned black that could send me to hell
Only time I hit my knees was to get out of jail
Only time i hit my knees was to get out of jail
