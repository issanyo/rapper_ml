[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Nigga with a bag, that's why them older niggas hated him
Know that ain't he goin', he'll crack a nigga cranium
Bigger than a mob, can't be touched, titanium
Gang goin' harder, dare a nigga to come and play with us
Stripper bitches mad 'cause I fucked her friend at stadium
Bitch know she done lost her whole life 'cause she ain't stay with us
Niggas know they'll lose they whole life if they play with us
Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Niggas know they be super goofy, they can't hang with us
She live for show, I just bought Chanel because she pigeon-toed
Pinky rose, I ain't talkin' champagne but they live for sure
Old days, we was havin' shootouts up in broad day
Hallways, mamas kick us out, that was always
Street shit, streets want anyone our age
Bro was found guilty with fourteen, boy them dog days
I know a rich nigga that'll kill you for some Balmains
Last nigga, say fuck my guys, now they all dead
I done got my bitch super pregnant, got 'em all mad
My guys fuck with your guys, then it's mob ties
Met a bougie bitch, said she ain't going, I took her to Popeyes
Why lie? She ain't pull her pants down, bye-bye
Why lie? I got six kids, I'm a da-da
Ride in that McLaren, when I see 'em, I'ma drive by
And you not my family, you ain't around me, on God, God
No, no, no, no, no
When you smoking on exotic, you need top notch
Shout WorldStar, on the come up, gave me top box
No, no
Niggas know they lyin', they say they got opps

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Nigga with a bag, that's why them older niggas hated him
Know that ain't he goin', he'll crack a nigga cranium
Bigger than a mob, can't be touched, titanium
Gang goin' harder, dare a nigga to come and play with us
Stripper bitches mad 'cause I fucked her friend at stadium
Bitch know she done lost her whole life 'cause she ain't stay with us
Niggas know they'll lose they whole life if they play with us
Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Took my last thirty shams, I bought a gram and got back in it
Always fallin' off in the mall, flexin' for the bitches
OG Boobie, top lieutenant, look him dead in his eyes
BreadWinner homicide, and now we on the rise
Foreign car pull in, oriental headlights
Starving in the trenches, one day we'll be just fine
I was gettin' them in high school, only rule is don't lie to me
See the belt, I'm a fly shooter, send the addy, I'll fly to it
Pourin' up the lean, droppin' bracelets in the cup
All this ice, I'ma die for it
All I ever wanted was a whip and to ride Forgis
Big booty bitch lounge around while we loud blowin'
Pen bump the hip and I'ma still be around for it

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Nigga with a bag, that's why them older niggas hated him
Know that ain't he goin', he'll crack a nigga cranium
Bigger than a mob, can't be touched, titanium
Gang goin' harder, dare a nigga to come and play with us
Stripper bitches mad 'cause I fucked her friend at stadium
Bitch know she done lost her whole life 'cause she ain't stay with us
Niggas know they'll lose they whole life if they play with us
Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
And I scream "I'm from the Lam'," I gotta let 'em know
He told on the whole mob, that's why they let him go
He first got locked up, ain't sent money, I sent letters though
My big bro had the D-line locked, it was in a finger four
He was on that block, you know what's up, what we did for Moe
Go fuck on me then fuck my mans, I don't get these hoes
Booka said he catch that bag, he gon' get D Rose
I ain't gon' lie, I tricked off once, I bought some Jimmy Choo's
Knew I was a star, dropped that song, I got some good reviews
Ain't gon' say her name but the bitch had bust me down for Fendi boots
And that nigga you callin' your big bro, I seen him gettin' hoed
Every time we come through swaggin', they wanna be us
Bitches always put they head down like they don't see us
They in the back of the plane, seat 27, had to key us
He don't know how to work no gun, he say it jammed but it was de-cocked

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Nigga with a bag, that's why them older niggas hated him
Know that ain't he goin', he'll crack a nigga cranium
Bigger than a mob, can't be touched, titanium
Gang goin' harder, dare a nigga to come and play with us
Stripper bitches mad 'cause I fucked her friend at stadium
Bitch know she done lost her whole life 'cause she ain't stay with us
Niggas know they'll lose they whole life if they play with us
Niggas know they'll lose they life if they play with us
