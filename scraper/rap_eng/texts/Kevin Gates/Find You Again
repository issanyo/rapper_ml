[Intro]
Ay, you could be so used to somethin', man
You know everyday you grow, everyday you changin'
And I never tried to change on you but it's just like
I had to do it by myself for so long to where when you come back into my life it just don't feel right like
Feel like somethin's missin'
And you feel like - you just feel different
So you gotta forgive me if I act strange wit'chu
Never changed wit'chu

[Chorus]
This is a burden that none of us want
The judge broke us up when I went back to court
Sentenced the time and it tore us apart
Beautiful creature and I know what you are
Prayed no one else get control of your heart
I hold it down, I was built for this part
Been away too long
I no longer know who you are
But I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again
I'll find you again, love, I'll find you again

[Verse 1]
All I knew was run it up and try to stack, stay focused
One day you be up to bat and I'm on it
Fingernails, tryna scrape
With the safety pin break it down to crack, whoever want it
Movin' reckless wit' the Gat, I protect the pack
I be stayin' strapped, niggas tryna jack, bitches tryna trap
Maybe it's perhaps, I be in the trap
And I got them racks near, stroked up, we keep it on her lap
You know how I'm comin', fall in the pit, I dive in your shit
I'm one in a million, I'm standin' on ten
Hit your bitch from the back, I supply her with dick
She was a virgin when she was with him
Showed her somethin', fuck everyone else
I can't give you the world but I give you myself
If you was loyal put my love on the shelf
You are now just a notch on the belt
Guess I'll find someone else but I ain't got time for no one else
Grind hard, Glendale bein' chauffeured
Panoramic roof, in here we smokin'
Legal pistol anybody approachin' (boom!)
In your name in case we get pulled over (woo, woo)

[Chorus]
This is a burden that none of us want
The judge broke us up when I went back to court
Sentenced the time and it tore us apart
Beautiful creature and I know what you are
Prayed no one else get control of your heart
I hold it down, I was built for this part
Been away too long
I no longer know who you are
But I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again
I'll find you again, love, I'll find you again

[Verse 2]
We was all utterly rejected
We went from nothin' to somethin' together
People like what the fuck you see in her?
Told you they like what the fuck you see in him?
Why you love him? You shouldn't trust him
He's a fuck up, so disgustin' and your family's sayin' fuck me
I'm successful and now they love me
Marble Slab, our first kiss
Recollectin' the night that you told me you need me
Told Tyra, "Baby, gimme the keys"
Put a dick on my hip on the highway, I'm speedin'
Just had a argument, you was too busy
I would get upset whenever you would leave me (don't leave me)
Joe changed form, got 'em tatted on my arm
Felt so alone and it wasn't easy
Late nights, grandmother's house
Talkin' takin' over the world together
Helped me through my insecurities
Sayin' you was gonna be my world forever
I comforted you through the death of our child
Had our first girl together
Our love is a fire inside and it's gon' burn forever

[Chorus]
This is a burden that none of us want
The judge broke us up when I went back to court
Sentenced the time and it tore us apart
Beautiful creature and I know what you are
Prayed no one else get control of your heart
I hold it down, I was built for this part
Been away too long
I no longer know who you are
But I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again
I'll find you again, love, I'll find you again

[Outro]
You know your momma from out the Nine
You what I'm sayin?
My grandma from out the Nine
All my cousins and shit from out the Nine you know?
Uh, I'm sayin' like, um, this-this how this 'sposed to go
This ain't no, you know
This how this 'sposed to go ya heard
Totin' my hustle all in the Nineth Ward
And I'm really retarded, yeah
Nigga, I'm really retarded, yeah
That bitch platinum (platinum, platinum, platinum)
