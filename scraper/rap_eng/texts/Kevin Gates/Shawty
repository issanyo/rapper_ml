[Chorus]
Even though I’m not your man
You’re not my girl - I’mma call you my
Shawty
Cause I can’t stand to see you treated bad
I’mma beat his ass for my
Shawty
And we ain’t did nothing that
We ain’t supposed to do
Cause you my - shanty
Baby girl - you know I’ll be home
Keep me on the ringtone
Shawty

[Verse 1]
Women be like - he try to fuck him
Right after he meet em
He’s insensitive in a sense
And don’t know how to treat em
But holding hands - I feel it’s so much
We could show each other
And we be kissing - touching
Fussing while we stroke each other
See the way we hold each other
We took a bath and you tried to get on top of me
Put on that Kevin - that’s my favorite
Wanna see you naked
Started progressin’ - and the situation got disgusting
Like you a gangsta bitch - and me being a hustler
This on the muscle - fuck it me and you
Had a toast - to having arguments in restaurants
And walking off
And still and all - when feelings fall
We kill em all - afraid of a relationship
We never tried to get involved
Said we’d never fall in love
That was in the winter
After sex and all that other shit
Went out the window
A lot of dick I deep tissue machine
While pinching one of your nipples
Accompanied by the screams

[Chorus]
Even though I’m not your man
You’re not my girl - I’mma call you my
Shawty
Cause I can’t stand to see you treated bad
I’mma beat his ass for my
Shawty
And we ain’t did nothing that
We ain’t supposed to do
Cause you my - shanty
Baby girl - you know I’ll be home
Keep me on the ringtone
Shawty
Say it to me girl (whoa)
(whoa whoa whoa)
Shawty
(whoa whoa whoa)
Shawty

[Verse 2]
I know you feel it
It’s elegant in a sense
Few delicate benefits
This thing is not a fling
It’s never been innocent
Say you with a friend
It better be you and Tiff
If you catch me with a bitch
I’m catching one in the lip
(Gates)
Get on top of you - and make your body feel electric
The way I take you in the room - and then we start undressin’
Any questions - not too many go unanswered
I’mma leave you cause I don’t believe in second chances
After fussing and the fucking - now we leaving town
And you telling me I ain’t shit - and like to sleep around
That ain’t the truth - you like a friend with a benefit
Trips on a plane - I’m missing you would complain
Fist fights with a lame and injuries I sustain
That’s the difference when it really come to making time
Street nigga handle business and he got a job
Street nigga handle business and he got a job

[Chorus]
Even though I’m not your man
You’re not my girl - I’mma call you my
Shawty
'Cause I can’t stand to see you treated bad
I’mma beat his ass for my
Shawty
And we ain’t did nothing that
We ain’t supposed to do
Cause you my - shanty
Baby girl - you know I’ll be home
Keep me on the ringtone
Shawty
