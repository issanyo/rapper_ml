(Intro)
This is where we separate the men from the mics

(Hook: Kevin Gates)
I don't know what you think, but they feel I'm retawdid
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it
See me rocking ice, you might say I'm ballin'
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it

I don't know what to call it, I don't know what to call it
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it (x2)

(Verse 1: Kevin Gates)
(Get em Gates)
I'm shining, I'm flossin', I'm really making cake
A hundred grand in Jury with this 40 on my waist
They beefin' in my section
I ain't scared to ride 'round
I'm a gangsta, run up on me crazy
You get blown, blown
I do this on purpose, you mad, you hurtin
We be in the club, I'm swag, I'm surfin
Got me saying damn, her ass, she workin
Had to get behind her, she bad, I'm flirtin'
Kevin Gates had to get it straight, rap game, heavy weight
I pull a hammer on a (blammer?) til the metal break
Shawty feel I'm retawdid, I'm already acting ill
So I put her on (Percardi?) and her party pack of pills
"Man I hate Kevin Gates" You tell everybody that
Dead Game Mafia, everybody strapped
Party pack of pills, I threw everybody back
Kevin Gates gettin' played up in everybody trap

(Hook: Kevin Gates)
I don't know what you think, but they feel I'm retawdid
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it
See me rocking ice, you might say I'm ballin'
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it

I don't know what to call it, I don't know what to call it
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it (x2)

(Verse 2: Kevin Gates)
I just had to.. Vrrrmm.. Pass through
Hard top drop in the bottom with the glass roof
Quarter key for all of my lil poppers, this what cash do
Love to show my ass, act bad, they'll smash you
Your girl on my liquor, feelin' on my tattoos
I could make her leave will let me spit her.. mm
Bad news, I'm tired of getting off, I wanna go legit
I'm worth a lot of stacks, I'm trying to throw a brick
Ringa-linga-ling
You could believe my money long
Who this Britney from (?)
Then I don't pick up the phone
Your girl sit behind me, she ain't tell you how I stroked her?
Would've gave you some but I heard you had a owner
I do this on purpose, you safe, you hurtin'
Stand up in they chest, they mad, it's workin'
There go Kevin Gates, put it in they face
I'm swag, I'm surfin, she bad, I'm flirtin'

(Hook: Kevin Gates)
I don't know what you think, but they feel I'm retawdid
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it
See me rocking ice, you might say I'm ballin'
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it

I don't know what to call it, I don't know what to call it
Know it's a name for it but I don't know what to call it (x2)
