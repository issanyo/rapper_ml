[Intro]
It ain't a diss song
It’s a real song

[Verse 1]
Concert in town, ain't nobody beating me out
Shit I'm the rawest
And the rap game leaving me out
Everybody looking for entertainment on the 4th
I’m on the block, maintaining no entertainment at all
I'm sick of being patient
I'm sick of waiting to ball
Them niggas got a deal
How come ain't nobody asking me?
Them niggas just acting, they ain't even half of me
Never been shot, never been to jail
I get locked never tell, see this rock I'ma sell
In the club by myself when they frontin' and mean muggin'
Can’t intimidate a G, shut don’t mean nothing
First bitch I ever loved let Jarrod get that ass
Second bitch I ever loved, killed in a car crash
Older brother trippin' get to slippin’ go to war fast
Armed robbery, apprehension
Co-defendant, never caught
Stood on the code of armor and never told on my nigga
(get 'um)

[Chorus]
I was supposed to be done blowed already
He the rawest, he retarded, but no not Kevin
Strained through the pain, and the lames can't feel 'um
Names rang in my state but my name ain’t nuthin'

[Verse 2]
On stage, we rocked out
Rockin' the crowd, in exchange I get played rockin' a frown
My bitch a gold digger she wiping 'um down
While in the trap he piping her down
I accept it, didn't like it but I took it and smiled
I look to the clouds, to the heavens ain't speaking aloud
Forever making mistakes, falling on my face
I just wanna die, how much more could I take?
God give me a sign
Show me I'm not forsaken
I trusted you for years, still I'm alone and naked
Maybe I'm to blame, I wasn't made to make it
Or you look at me the same
The same as you look at Satan
How you try to love when you're hearts full of hatred?
How do you forgive when in your heart it ain't [?]
I don't pop, you understand?
I'm a killer I tote Glocks, you understand?
Labels try to get me from my label they tried
Being loyal to my father I frankly denied
Played the bitch ass nigga
Ass nigga gave orders
Came with no complaining, taking it raw
Same thing never granted me creative control
Feeling loved when your people got cheesed by the freezer bag
I tried hard to tell 'um I'm in need of cash
I'm the one you screamin' at
Fuck it i won't even ask

[Chorus x2]
I was supposed to be done blowed already
He the rawest, he retarded, but no not Kevin
Strained through the pain, and the lames can't feel 'um
Names rang in my state but my name ain't nuthin'
