[Intro]
Say old bitch ass nigga I fuck wit you, ya heard me
He had tried to play me pussy, speak on it
You know you my nigga, ya heard me
But this how I go sometimes in the game that we play ya heard me
When you a boss you gotta do somethin' you don't wanna do

[Hook]
Everybody hollin' Gates you need to watch your weight
I been standin' in the kitchen, guess I'm watchin' weight
People hollin' Gates you need to start workin' out
Sellin' work I'm on my grind, guess I'm workin' out
Everybody hollin' Gates you been gainin' weight
I just flipped from two to five, guess I'm gainin' weight
Girlfriends yellin' I need to be liftin' iron
Both my convictions was for pistols, stay be liftin' iron

[Verse 1]
Black ruger, white Panamera
Won't fuck your wife in the right manner
I could lock the work with the arm and hammer
Trap girl she armed with hammers
Won't walk the Ave unless on Canal
Hit the Iberville with like 20 bells
I'm a live nigga like Lonnie B, free Killer Stone and Lonnie B
Got Boobie Black and he ride with me ?
Baby gangsta won't pay to spank ya
Ice pick ya knees might break ya finger
This whip's amazin', meant to say Caucasian
With a black abrasion like Carson daily
Car been waitin' I was just complaining
Bout Luca Brasi is fried, out his mind

[Hook]
Everybody hollin' Gates you need to watch your weight
I been standin' in the kitchen, guess I'm watchin' weight
People hollin' Gates you need to start workin' out
Sellin' work I'm on my grind, guess I'm workin' out
Everybody hollin' Gates you been gainin' weight
I just flipped from two to five, guess I'm gainin' weight
Girlfriends yellin' I need to be liftin' iron
Both my convictions was for pistols, stay be liftin' iron

[Verse 2]
Bread Winners Association
My jaws locked no combination
Got a hard-on in the hard top
Yo bitch whipping no conversation
Three baby mommas and a hood wife
I'm killing, brought the whole clique this year
Tear drops in my shit this year
Ain't no pretending, your ho pretentious
I give the go, she a floating rivers
Get coke delivered don't boast my nigga
My grandmother sell dope, remember?
Lil niggas in charge, my dick won't even get hard
Less I snort a line of that boy
Bitch I'm south side that bottom
Bitch I'm Carolina that boy, I go hard

[Hook]
Everybody hollin' Gates you need to watch your weight
I been standin' in the kitchen, guess I'm watchin' weight
People hollin' Gates you need to start workin' out
Sellin' work I'm on my grind, guess I'm workin' out
Everybody hollin' Gates you been gainin' weight
I just flipped from two to five, guess I'm gainin' weight
Girlfriends yellin' I need to be liftin' iron
Both my convictions was for pistols, stay be liftin' iron
