(Intro)
From the driver side door, you take my pain and you turn it into purpose you hold on to me, sometimes you hold on to me, Work Nigga!

(Hook)
Work comin' in from a lot of different spots
Shift never over soldiers workin' 'round the clock
I no longer gamble since my partna lost his top
I hustle through the pain I just give it all I got
Foreign engineerin' I maneuver to the guap
Wishin' optimistic this shit started over pots
Everybody 'round me got agendas I be watchin' while they plot
Hustle through the pain I just give it all I got

(Verse 1)
All the rejection Im catchin' hell flashback and propel
Turn my pain into purpose focal point to excel
Give me the funds doin' crunches shirt X-X-L
Prison lunches doin' lunges in the back of a cell
Went to the penn and did a bid Im plugged wit' the cartel
I get roadside assistance they deliver the bales
Punted shit for our sister bodies under my belt
Ima 3 time convicted felon 50 million in wealth
It's a 100 k a feature or go find someone else Im a bread winner Dumb bitch Im signin' myself white Wraith in the slums parked in front the projects I don't hang where Im from I just bought the projects

(Hook)
Work comin' in from a lot of different spots
Shift never over soldiers workin' 'round the clock
I no longer gamble since my partna lost his top
I hustle through the pain I just give it all I got
Foreign engineerin' I maneuver to the guap
Wishin' optimistic this shit started over pots
Everybody 'round me got agendas I be watchin' while they plot
Hustle through the pain I just give it all I got

(Verse 2)
Congested all my feelings I learned how to compress 'em
Got over bein' neglected used to hate my reflection
Scarred all over my body brick layer finesser
Big timer William Rider brushed aluminum texture
Matte white soft close touch pull up Im flexin' private jet fly correct 40 thousand no pressure throwin' money at the strippers order up and invest it
Put her legs up by her head she do that wit' no effort
Crack a smile my mouth illuminated really on ice fly you in from outta town and put some dick in your life
Different methods disinfectin' different parts of my brain
Coulda went and saw a car but I went caught me a chain

(Hook)
Work comin' in from a lot of different spots
Shift never over soldiers workin' 'round the clock
I no longer gamble since my partna lost his top
I hustle through the pain I just give it all I got
Foreign engineerin' I maneuver to the guap
Wishin' optimistic this shit started over pots
Everybody 'round me got agendas I be watchin' while they plot
Hustle through the pain I just give it all I got
