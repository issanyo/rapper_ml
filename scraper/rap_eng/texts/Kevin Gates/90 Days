(Intro)
What up big dawg!!(Beat Zombie)
Real nigga status (Real nigga status)
I ain't doing nothing strange, put it on change
(I am Michael Jackson)
But ain't no shame in my game you understand me
Real nigga status
I'll go get a job if that's what takes it
I am Michael Jackson

(Hook)
Don't nobody understand me
I ain't caring what they say
Behind your back, Talked bad about you
While they smile in your face
Turn they back when shit get real
They gonna do that anyway
Alot'ta lonely nights I cried
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em, Grindin'
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days
Grindin' on 'em! Grindin'
Could you give me 90 days
Grindin' on em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days

(Verse 1)
(What up-Cut up)
I remember wishing on a star
We was broke and we ain't have a car
We collected change in a jar
Going half on the weed
Hit the store and stealing a cigar
When the money gone, Women leave
So we treat the hoes like what they are
Breaking in cars, Stealing radios
And the microwave got SpagettiOs
New pair of Jordans for a stereo
Well I got it on me, Im'ma let it go
Clutching bad with a metal glove
Gangsta nigga, you already know
Live the shit they rap about, this ain't the shit they ready for
Out the mud, I maintain for this
Cocaine slang for this
In the game, Bitch I prayed for this
Do my thang for this
Baltimore, Bullets rang for this
Diamond chain equipped
Stayed the same
All my partners changed
And I can't hang with them
Check me out

(Hook)
Don't nobody understand me
I ain't caring what they say
Behind your back, Talked bad about you
While they smile in your face
Turn they back when shit get real
They gonna do that anyway
Alot'ta lonely nights I cried
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em, Grindin'
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days
Grindin' on 'em! Grindin'
Could you give me 90 days
Grindin' on em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days

(Verse 2)
I love you nigga like a brother
I met you through my big brother
I'm'ma real nigga till I die
I ain't never tried to fuck your baby mother
Too much respect for to touch'er
And I look at her like a mother
My grandmother up and died on me
Only thing I had like a mother
Fuck the fame, Nigga thuggin'
Not to many make it out the struggle
I no longer go to funerals
But I'm spending money on the guns
I done killed shit
I done paid for it
When my daughter cried in my arms
Disrespect me nigga, Im'ma die about
Anyday, you knowing it's the law
Bread Winner getting off
In a jail cell all alone
You rap niggas kinda wack to me
You ain't never really went to war
Beat a nigga to the car
Yeah, I'm really throwed off
Catch them slipping at the red light
Watch you get your shit blowed off
Raw

(Hook)
Don't nobody understand me
I ain't caring what they say
Behind your back, Talked bad about you
While they smile in your face
Turn they back when shit get real
They gonna do that anyway
Alot'ta lonely nights I cried
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em, Grindin'
I am not ashamed
Grindin' on 'em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days
Grindin' on 'em! Grindin'
Could you give me 90 days
Grindin' on em!
Im'ma be someone you love one day just give me 90 days

(Outro)
Don't you-Don't you ever come around here
Real nigga status, Real nigga status
Come around here , I am Michael Jackson
Don't you-Don't you ever come around here
Real nigga status, Real nigga status
Don't you come around here , I am Michael Jackson
...Come around here
Gotta be humble when you come around here
It's a jungle when you come around here-ohhh
Gotta be humble when you come around here
They gonna expose you, don't you come around here-noo
