[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I'm a dog in the streets, my name sumn serious
Can't go nowhere by yourself, bitch you ain't nothin serious
[?] niggas dames, her brains somethin serious
Bitch you play, then you lay (gun sounds) sumn serious

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Okay seriously, young nigga tryna duck conspiracy
Lot of niggas ain't real as they appear to be
Can't none of em' fuck with me lyrically
Dead fuckin serious, on that drank, don't know how I'm steering
Spend a comma, make your chest look like a period
Tell a ho get off my line
No, I don't wanna hear it, bitch you can't be serious
Police ass nigga, trap interference
Tryna get up out these streets
Ten racks for an appearance
My homie took it, I just bought it
Got my sack on clearance
Young niggas fearless, Aiming at your brain, leave ya earless
You hear me? Or as Gates would say, "Ya heard me?"
It's Monday, I've been up since Thursday
Sun comin up we still serving
I love countin money this early
Just did a verse for a pound of purple

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Verse for a pound of urp? Got damn Lito thats Murda
Green with purple strands, Donatello, ninja turtle
In the trap stash with the trash bag, I sell swag by the hashtag
Hold pounds like the dumbell rack
Brain flat, you won't catch that
I'm seein green while slangin sand with a 9 iron and a snap back
Not golfer, life a golf course
My caddy holdin my backpack
Gat black, goin blat blat, if a bitch nigga don't bag back
Pussy rapper got a bad rap? Immitation, intimidation
I just figure they scalp dry
Poor condition, got niggas flaking
Try to play me, visit satan or the one who created satan
Chasing paper, every day, as if it snubbed me and got away
Yopper never low on potassium
Fresh banana, just got today

[Verse 3: Starlito]
That just means you get shot today
Telescope on my three-oh-eight, Hit that ass from a block away
If a nigga cooperate, then the doctor gon operate
Fuckin right I rock with Gates, Niggas hate, then it's choppa play
I just want respect on my mind and grind
Don't know how they manage to hate cause I can't find the time
I'm so preoccupied with these dollar signs
They say they gettin money but they probably lyin
I'm sumn serious when it comes to these lyrics, The picture become the clearest
These tips at your head, your scripture get read, and then you become a spirit
Keep talkin pussy nigga but I don't wanna hear it
Point, aim, point blank range, point blank period
I'm dead serious

[Hook]
