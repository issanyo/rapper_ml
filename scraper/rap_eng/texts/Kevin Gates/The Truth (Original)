[Chorus]
I’m the truth from the streets to the booth
I’m the truth I serve rappers and trappers
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

I’m the truth from my spot to yo spot
From yo block to my block
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

[VERSE 1]
Gates - my family full of street niggas
Killers on my side that’ll bang ya out
And beef with ya
To show you I’mma beast nigga
I once fucked over three niggas
I’ll fighting go to shaking
Ain’t no tapping out with me nigga

Money stretched pressed cop a fresh bricks over here
Money jumping out the pocket - fresh out the soda bear
Where he from - where is at
(who it is that ?)
Don’t leave him breath get em E
That’s another trunk ?

Respect ain’t what it is
The making of a king
Dead game - I got the right to leave em
Naked where they sleep

You take it and you leave
Don’t be bracing up to me
Put that metal in your mouth
Like - braces on your teeth

80s baby - born in the crack epidemic
Now it’s New Era fitted rock fresh Academics
Live by the code unless you pay to coast
I ain’t caring if you sharing it’s best you break it off

[Chorus]
I’m the truth from the streets to the booth
I’m the truth I serve rappers and trappers
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

I’m the truth from my spot to yo spot
From yo block to my block
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

[VERSE 2]
Gates get it like - gun in hand
I’ll make blow do the running man
Then exchange oh him - play Randal Cunningham

Niggas saying duck the game
Cause the struggle man
I’m trying to count mo change
Than a Money Gram
Watch all this shit
Make it rain from the other hand
Nigga bout to have a coupe
Posted up on the block
Roof like a stadium
It open up from the top
Move like a Jefferson - straight to the side
If you grind harder than me
Your bricks fin to die
Gates and Dead Game ain’t goin’ to pretend
Man carry weight like a chain on the end
My dick don’t exist without brain on the end
No cut - cut straight like a blade on your skin
A lot of niggas slow it down - yes I’mma speed up
Running through a field of grass marching over tree stumps
Ain’t no catching up to me
Way too many speed bumps

[Chorus]
I’m the truth from the streets to the booth
I’m the truth I serve rappers and trappers
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

I’m the truth from my spot to yo spot
From yo block to my block
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

[VERSE 3]
Gates - BWA
(what that stand for)
Bread Winners Association
Hustle like get to work
Nigga never gets sleep
Watch it turn to rock
Pot popping like fish grease
Stacks in a rubber band
Grind stand six feet
I’ll make a bitch bleed
Turn him into Swiss cheese
Body full of holes
Like a sponge in a rinse sink
Violence - problems get overlapped
Why is that - cause the bottom always strapped
Everythang a nigga know - got a tote a gat
Forgive me lord - I know a nigga day coming
It’s like I turned a machine - I just make money
I got a session - set for ? my bitch with me
Ten minutes for the hour - black 650
Dead Game - I gotta send the paint
My watch look like I took a Glock and shot it in the face

[Chorus]
I’m the truth from the streets to the booth
I’m the truth I serve rappers and trappers
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga

I’m the truth from my spot to yo spot
From yo block to my block
I’m the truth - I hold the block nigga
Wasn’t on the block nigga
Now I own the block nigga
