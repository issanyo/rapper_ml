Could go and get a job but is rather stay in stack

I haha get down dirty going touch em up my momma like they momma so that'll kinda fuck her up
Low key , them collared shirts got a button up
You say he got a lot of blow he better button up
100 stacks ; you owe this to the game .. but you surprised ?
Mayne you know this never changed but besides
You prolly blow this on a chain
Now take me to the safe 'for I blow this on your brain
Try to earn cash but they ask where
I get it from
Nigga keep feeding me that work then I'mma nigga son
Z28s with, 8 fuckin' cylinders furnish my apartment with Ashley Millennium
Bitches keep asking it and gates ain't feeling em take em home and bend them to the gate where I'm sending them
You gotta keep in mind
I'm a street nigg*
Who kept it in the hood
Real street nigg*
You get out of line , imma get street with you I'm dead game bottom line let them heats hit you
I got in shape I ain't take a lunch break
The devil in my face for 11 months straight
I let em eat for 7 weeks , I layed off em
It ain't safe in the corner so I stayed off em
Get it straight ... WHATCHU mean "I got other plans"?
That hard life ; that tan , I'm like hustle man
I got that peanut butter mmmmmm in my other hand
I'm from the state you stupid you buy a brick , I put it in Louis Vuitton luggage ; buy 10, I throw in the Louis Vuitton duffel
That mini Mac 90
Louis Vuitton muscle
On an island like who wanna be a millionaire
My king player speak Spanish and got pretty hair
I'm in the game but I'm steady Trying to ease out
I took away from the streets but never reached out
I hung around ; took a peep from the top
I never knew dreams could be achieved from the blocks say I never knew dreams could be achieved from the Blocks
Say I never knew dreams could be achieved from the blocks I never knew dreams could be achieved from the blocks
You gotta keep in mind
I'm a street nigg*
Who kept it in the hood

My jacket went from rabbit to chinchilla
Ruth's Chris for dinner
Stilla be In a rental Blowin killa with a killer
My main focus in life was grind and get money
God show me the light so I rhyme to get money
Remember
On the air with them grams in my hand
Imma man took a stand never stand on the stare
Want green ? got peas you can handle em for me
Probably touch more keys than a janitor will see
Flip faced component
Handle by the seat
The hammer in my reach for dismantling your teeth knock ya brains outcha melon leave them splattered on your cheek
Now everything you thinkin all splattered in the street
Baffled by the street no exchange this a robbery
Cooking over blow the cain a commodity
745s, they crack pipe gray
With cream colored seats over cooked dope beige
You gotta keep in mind
