[Chorus]
Who remembers
Death in the family
Mental in shambles
To my children
I’m not an example

Back to court
Rockin shackles and sandals
Dreams of coming up
As we took chances

Friends canceled
No second chances
Let me just make it with rappin
The pistols come out
Pullin chicks cause I’m rappin

[First Verse]
Who remembers
From public defenders
To sippin that nectar
Drivin that hooptie
To is that a rental - new clothes
Trappin out denim
Speak my mind
Don’t care if I offend
Them pack boys
I tatt’d the emblem (448)
My pockets was empty
Feeling nauseous
Had to bounce back - from the losses
Had to get it up - on some ball shit
Only see the come up
They don’t never see the struggle
Got it out the swamp
Really had to hustle

With tunnel vision
In the concrete jungle
[?] rats
And the police trying to cuff you
Wonderin where the love at
When they say the love you

I’m supposed to fail
Supposed to be in jail
Me and my nigga really lost
Thirty five in the mail
Had to shake some
Get on the ground
Take some (I swear)
I don’t make excuses
I make money

[Chorus]
Who remembers
Death in the family
Mental in shambles
To my children
I’m not an example

Back to court
Rockin shackles and sandals
Dreams of coming up
As we took chances

Friends canceled
No second chances
Let me just make it with rappin
The pistols come out
Pullin chicks cause I’m rappin

[Second Verse]
Have you ever had
Trials and tribulations
Cause I remember
The trials and probation
Cuts from the cuffs
Cutting circulation
Keep my mind strong
But my heart vacant

Look up my name you see mugshots
Look up my finger a gunshot
Karma for keeping my gun cocked
Drinking in the pad
Like Jordan with his tongue out

I remember
When all my hope was gone (I was hopeless)
Break into houses
I’m from a broken home

Now I’m going strong
Trapping hard off a mobile phone
I feel trapped
But got the trap booming
Ain’t got no credit
But be at the credit union
Took the knife out my back
So I hang around some shooters
Try to snake me like Judas

[Chorus]
Who remembers
Death in the family
Mental in shambles
To my children
I’m not an example

Back to court
Rockin shackles and sandals
Dreams of coming up
As we took chances

Friends canceled
No second chances
Let me just make it with rappin
The pistols come out
Pullin chicks cause I’m rappin
