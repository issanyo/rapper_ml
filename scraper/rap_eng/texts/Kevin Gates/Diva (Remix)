[Intro: Don Toliver]
You, player, player
Player, player, uh

[Chorus: Don Toliver]
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
No panties with a skirt, attitude, she don't flirt
Compliment her, she'll smirk, slim, fine, down to Earth
Swipe the card, she don't sweat it if they say it didn't work
Quickly whippin' out them racks from out her new Chanel purse
P-pay attention, she-she the business
Only one condition, you can't get in your feelings
Fallin' from the ceiling, shawty look at me with thirst
Gatorade, my diamonds water, I could quench your thirst

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Kevin Gates]
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)

[Verse 2: Don Toliver]
It's a set up (huh), keep your head up
Shawty got her edges (huh), she keep her hair done
Pull up in a wrecked whip (huh), it's a red one
She don't do no friendships (huh), she gon' take some
But she do the benefits (huh) if she make some
Lil shawty innocent (huh) 'til she takes some
Beatin' down her ribcage (huh) 'til he breaks some
Shawty in her own world (huh), she in The Matrix

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
And she clean, reflectin' me, matching Js and Supreme
Got these starters, one of her favorite, she gon' answer every ring
Text message goin' "beep", sippin' solo with her king
Tag team one of her homegirls with Maceo, Hazid
When she walking' out in public, big old booty back and forth
That ain't nothing, you should see the way it wiggle in her shorts
Step inside the club, it look like she receivin' an award
Niggas go to showin' off, ballers go to bottle wars

[Chorus: Don Toliver & Kevin Gates]
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
Lurks outside, she has no reason (huh)
Take your cash and swipe your Visa
Strip club poppin', she naked for the evening (huh)
New Chanel poppin', she got the latest season (huh)
White on white, she sexy for the weekend
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
I know she's a bad lil diva (huh)
