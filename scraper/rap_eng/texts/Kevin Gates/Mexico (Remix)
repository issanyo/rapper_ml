[Hook: Stitches]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio

[Verse 1: Stitches]
When I met Julio, I swear to God, my life changed
He done put me in that serious cocaine game
He told me what I had to do to get away with crime
And now I'm always loaded up with money all the time
He got locked up and man, I had to [?] his bond for him
He was a real nigga with me, I kept it real with him
You wanna tell on your plug, well, you's a pussy nigga
If they snatch me up, I don't know who the fuck is that nigga
I say, "Fuck you, and your feelings"
In the drug game I done made a killin'
Niggas want a problem, I'm ready for war
If you want problems, nigga, we come to your door
If you got a problem, nigga, put you on the floor
And I put a gun right down in your throat
Shoot you in your body and your intestine
Don't ask me no fuckin' questions
When they put me in that room I don't ever fold
When they put me in that room I don't ever fold
Fuck you pussy pig
I need my lawyer, I ain't sayin' shit

[Hook: Stitches]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Bread winner cartel, bread winner cartel
I pull up by myself go ask the plug, ye Im for real
We back to back in Porsches with the loud pipes
Crack a smile, my diamonds dancin' rockin' loud ice
Turning up in the foreign car, ma says got the Audemar
Rocks and cotton goin' dumb and you know that's a lot of Rs
Julio, he not afraid to serve, he a gangsta
Drop 200, that's like 20 squares, on vacation
I like to sip the lean a lot, you know that's medication
Fucked with the plug daughter, I used to be the enforcer
When niggas ain't want come with they bread I used to force 'em
I'm Bond hop the Bentley Cooper, move to Austin, retarded
It was soft till I drop it in the water
7 grams of soda, every ounce comin' hard
Your favorite rapper pussy and his feelings 'bout a broad
I ain't killed ya boy, but I did ya other boy

[Hook: Stitches]
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
When I went to Mexico, my life changed
I got my bricks from Julio
I got my bricks from Julio
I'm drinkin' on Don Julio
A hundred bricks from Julio, Julio
