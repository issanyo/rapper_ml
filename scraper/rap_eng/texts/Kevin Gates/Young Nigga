[Bridge]
I been thinking bout chasing green since a young nigga
Hung around a old head, but I never was a dumb nigga
Nigga tried to send me off, tried to second guess a young nigga

[Verse 1: Sino]
Been stack 2017, i was a young nigga
Now listen little young nigga, you better keep reing up, better learn to stack funds nigga
You better stay away from guns nigga, trying to make it out the hood, better stay away from dumb niggas
This shit can motivate you young niggas, back when Meech came up shit motivated young niggas
But the street show no love, better watch who you deal with cause niggas get you fucked up

[Hook]
Getting cream with my young niggas
Got a team full of young niggas
Only fuck with some niggas
I'm OG to these young niggas, young nigga
Young Nigga
Young Nigga

[Verse 2: Sino]
Hear you been coping more ye, stacking them huns in them safes
Now you got guns on your waist, told you these niggas dont play, they run in your place
It's al in the game young nigga, sunny right now might rain young nigga, homies in the hood might change young nigga
Getting money when it's good, when it's bad take the stain ypung nigga
So find you a place, stay on the low, sell that shit on the low, stay the hell out the way, I did it by myself, had a thing for yourself, you get rich by the day
Speaking to you as a OG young nigga, get your mind right, you'll see young nigga
I'ma keep it real, I'm what you wanna be young nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Getting [?] own place, get your leg on
I'm on the phone trynna get some crack, anyone pull up I know how to get it back
Piss tube wearing, cocaine in the trap, pounds of the loud on the real nigga strap [?]
Traveling on the train I ain't fucking with the meal, baxkup girl scout cookies by the bell
My nigga can you open when you put on sell, wanna see you on your feet, young nigga doing well
Young nigga out of line, see my youngins in his head
I dont gang bang, gun bang see you in red, friend said slang a slow walker nigga dead, who ever said it tell'em keep you in there prayers, did me already ain't nobody getting spared
Fuck nigga cooking out by dog food, only put a four on the door bet it cost you, talking bout a nice tile served I lost you, moving in the park and can't nobody walk through, tour coming up 15 for a walk through
I don't get tired I be resting with my eyes closed, I'll go walking in I'm slipping out the side door, paradoid I don't like pulling up a pot holes, bitches I ain't trusting, but the money pronto

[Hook]
