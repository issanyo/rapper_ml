[Intro: O.T. Genasis]
O.T
Yeah you know this so hard man
I ain’t even getting on this one
I did what I had to do, ooh!
All I want is money
All I want is money
Top down, show the cleavage
This right here the remix

[Hook: O.T. Genasis & Young Thug]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it (whoops), but it, but it, but it
But it, but it, but it, but it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to but it
Your price is way too high, you need to but it

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I need some racks like a shottas
I might just go and rob the bread truck
I got your bitch in the spotty
Make her suck dick ‘til I’m fed up
These bitches they know I don’t play with them
They know that my niggas will spray on them
We lie to these bitches like rugs
We tell ‘em anything to lay with them
She come and do it ‘cause I’m not a disgrace
She gon’ follow me way to the private jet place
I’ma keep me a rubber, I can't leave no trace
I’ma take off that rubber and bust on her face
What you gon’ do?
I ran up my ring and I pull out the wraith
Talk ‘bout that ice
Got diamonds on me and they wet like a sink

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Gold Rolex and it’s presidential
Thing I wanted once since elementary
I’m just a breadwinner chasing that money
Don’t bother me back, women follow me
Out in Detroit, I need none’ but way better
I’m special, you better not lie to me
I’m ‘bout to rebound on a real
I’m in the street pound for a kill
I need a sweet house on the hills
I’m in the projects in the field
Harriet Tubman on the bill
Think I need two pills worth of them
Way I be talking like need to chill
Can I be honest, I cannot pretend
Pass by the clique house, having a garage sale
Big cars, big rods, all of ‘em raw as hell
Flip phone, call the cell, bounce back off a L
Broke wrist, ah yeah, bread winner cartel
Big money matter fact, grind tryna get it back
I don’t go to church, in the booty club, blew a sack
God knows it was hard, he was thinking he was giving back
In the trap house shooting craps, tryna win it back
Cut the plug off, price high, he don’t want a cut?
I don’t need nobody I can get it out the mud

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
