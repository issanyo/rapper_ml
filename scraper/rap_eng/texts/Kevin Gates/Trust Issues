[Chorus]
Trust issues got me being cautious
Not friendly - niggas rolling swishers
Do I wanna hit it - not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I’m ridin solo - I be strapped with that nine milli

Imma make a killin
Imma make a killin
Baby Imma different type of real
I can’t make you feel me
Never disrespect Imma make a killing
Maybe to polices in my city I’m already guilty

[FIrst Verse]
Adjudicated housing where I’m residin is boarded up
Don’t go off - go hard - go hard or starve at work hard or rough
Walking up don’t talk to us for nothin - exit get from round me
Been in the streets I see police that don’t protect and serve me

Bands on the badge of a bad one
Stretch him make him hurt
Young niggas go bezerk
Easing pain taking narcotics

Hearing sirens south side
Found another body
Nobody ever gave us take it
Resort to robbin

Education in the game
Which came from out here vibin
While on the move bumping future
Ain’t no way around it

Wild in school
Caught up chasing loot
Take a break I doubt it
Nuts hanging to the floor
Nothing else to say about it

[Chorus]
Trust issues got me being cautious
Not friendly - niggas rolling swishers
Do I wanna hit it - not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I’m ridin solo - I be strapped with that nine milli

Imma make a killin
Imma make a killin
Baby Imma different type of real
I can’t make you feel me
Never disrespect Imma make a killing
Maybe to polices in my city I’m already guilty

[Second Verse]
These things make a down block sound shot
Just to make the news - more murders than any town got
He just want some shoes - you food if you got a round knot
I don’t like niggas who be talking out of turn

Solid object - gotta turn in a profit
Feed my pocket - fiber optic
Going bri bricka bracka my type of violence
Live a hustler die a gangster
Why not move in silence
I’m the original myself - can’t be no carbon copies

Switch lanes here come behind me
Pullin up on side me - now I’m being polished
While getting brain with an autococker
Listen to Starlito - other rapper’s a fucking liar
100 gang come on FIRE FIRE FIRE FIRE

[Chorus]
Trust issues got me being cautious
Not friendly - niggas rolling swishers
Do I wanna hit it - not really
Blood in the streets for any one of my niggas
I’m ridin solo - I be strapped with that nine milli

Imma make a killin
Imma make a killin
Baby Imma different type of real
I can’t make you feel me
Never disrespect Imma make a killing
Maybe to polices in my city I’m already guilty
