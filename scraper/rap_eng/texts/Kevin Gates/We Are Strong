[Intro: Lil Bibby]
I don't know what the fuck wrong with these niggas man
Somebody tell me, please tell me, I don't know
It just, I don't feel these niggas

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Yea, I'm the young nigga with the sick flow
They watchin' how I move cause they know I get dough
Posted on the block, stuntin' with my kin folks
Nigga, you ain't talkin' money what the fuck you here for?
When I'm finna cop a crib somewhere by the rich folks
Same old young nigga used to kick doors
The whole world love me cause they know my shit cold
If not, I switch hoes every time I switch clothes
Pockets got knots in 'em, keep a couple Glocks near 'em
Long ass clip, know it got a lot of shots in 'em
Keep a bad thot with 'em, killas from the block with 'em
Pussy ass rap niggas always got the cops with 'em
That's why I can't fuck with 'em, never put my trust in 'em
How they gone react when a nigga get to bustin'?
Couple shots fired, watch the niggas get to runnin'
Niggas sneak dissin' so I just say fuck it

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Really said fuck 'em, this is not a rap song
Boost Mobile Curve, this is not a TracFone
Contract free, what a nigga trap on
Inner tube, cocaine with the mustard on a couple
Pray the Lord keep me safe from who I fuck without a rubber
Prayer make me cold hearted, I don't ever wanna love again
Sacrificing random money, up and bought another Benz
Brother got murdered, I'll never have another friend
Now I'm blowing loud when our lounge got emotional
At times but the drugs help a motherfucker tuck 'em in
Diamonds in my teeth will help me represent the struggle
People in position recognize a nigga muscle
When you come up in the slums having nothing make you humble
Stomach rumble learned to kill without a question in the jungle
Scary ass rappers when I leave a nigga mumble
Got it out the mud, they respect a nigga hustle

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
I be tellin' my little brother
"Mane look you got a whole promising future in front of you"
He be ready to flash out and you know, go with his move
I really don't feel right givin' no good advice cause I'm in the streets thugging
I can get killed or go to jail any day
Shit, but by any means, we gonna fucking eat

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby & (Kevin Gates)]
Aye Gates, where should I start with 'em?
I can tell these young boys ain't got no heart in 'em
Niggas funny, you don't even like to talk with 'em
(Me either but we gotta play it smart with 'em
Man fuck 'em in they ass, we finessin' for the check
If they get outta line they might get one in the neck)
Lay a nigga down, then skeet off in the 'Vette
Leave a nigga wet, I can't take no disrespect
(Loaded Mac-11, Bibby come through with the Tech
Shoulder play amazing nigga wanna get some wreck
Say you want us dead? You won't take another breathe
All I know is us, I don't see nobody else)
Did it on my own, I don't need nobody help
I was on the block movin' P's by myself
Chasin' after cash, everything movin' fast
Gotta get it while you can cause you know it won't last
(Rap don't work, Back to standin' in the trap
On the phone, in the kitchen, cookin' wearin' slabs
Nigga want four, I'mma hit him for the 40
40 Grand a bird, yea, a nigga been retawdid
Me and Bibby in the building, life of the party
Know it's got a name but I don't know what to call it)

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong
