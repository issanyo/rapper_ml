[Intro]
People telling me... talking 'bout, tell Kevin he shouldn't say he don't like living cause God gave me the light; no. I don't like life. But you know, I feel like the Lord blessed a nigga, you know what I'm saying? He blessed me everyday fucking day he let me wake up to this horrible motherfucker, you know what I'm saying? So the nigga tell me my attitude negative. Bitch I'm in the negative, what the fuck you mean?

[Verse 1]
I wanna be casket sharp ready when death call me
Ghetto up in heaven be a place where we all meet
Fresh out the box, no mistake if they off me
Strapped by the crotch, Gates waist like a car seat
Nigga never harm me, take your charge
Life straight, pray to God when the day get hard
You remember I don't recruit to get at you
December, Timberland boots and winter suits
In the matchbox, crack up, under the trap floor
Listening to Jay and Lupe Fiasco
Another bitch say she wanna sit in the beamer
Blow spliffs, put her lips by the tip of the penis
I was getting slapped by the ass and the nice tits
Pussy make a face in her, mouth like a vise grip
Gates why you playing, nigga think u saying something
This bitch a breadwinner
This slut gettin' fucked in the butt
Couple a bucks, I couple get some head from her

[Interlude 1]
After showing him the footage, he feeling a lil froggish. Got him pointing to his dick sucker and he still with the bitch

[Hook]
Just started and I aim to see finish
Can't walk away or change - I'm deep in it
The ones that ain't caught up or slain, they defendants
And Gates ain't leaving the game, believe in it
Just started and I aim to see finish
Can't walk away or change - I'm deep in it
The ones that ain't caught up or slain, they defendants
And Gates ain't leaving the game, believe in it

[Interlude 2]
They got you sitting down, strapped to a chair; they got you taking all kind of medicines. I'm not even believing the shit they telling me I was doing until I seen myself on camera

[Verse 2]
I'm loyal to nobody but this thing of ours
Tryna get cream till the whole team empowered
Ask Kevin Gates, don't be askin' a nigga
I'll die 'fore I ever pay draft to a nigga
They shackled a nigga
I don't know how you loving life
Hassling niggas, only because they hustle right
Gotta be a great, I barely pick a pen up
Time to get established, trap starting to pick up
I get a little action, now I'm calling the clique up
Gates in love, he stay writing 'bout a bitch
A tablet on the shitter - writing when I shit
Can't make it, had to pay a working order fee with
Bumps on my ass from a dirty toilet seat
Pain but, I don't think they hurt as hard as me
Never between teeth, I say it aloud
And they forcing an abortion, tryna murder my child

[Hook]
Just started and I aim to see finish
Can't walk away or change - I'm deep in it
The ones that ain't caught up or slain, they defendants
And Gates ain't leaving the game, believe in it
Just started and I aim to see finish
Can't walk away or change - I'm deep in it
The ones that ain't caught up or slain, they defendants
And Gates ain't leaving the game, believe in it

[Outro]
Wonder why he act like that; he always frowned up, he hold his hand right there like he retarded or something. See at the same time niggas could say whatever they want to, but I'm tightening my circle up, you know what I'm saying? You wasn't there when shit was bad, now all of a sudden you just wanna be 'round, wanna hang in the shot. Ain't none of that man, ain't none of that
