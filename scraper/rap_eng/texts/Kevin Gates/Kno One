[Hook]
She says I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fiendin' for me, I can get it wet
She says I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

[Verse 1]
Let me see you drop it, throw it back
I'm bout to pin you to the carpet
Like a slur, you goin' fast
I'm bout to make you get up off it
Couple bald head hoes, lotta long weave
Got a tall red head ho, swear she wants me
Shawty need some transportation, but she can't afford it
How bout you ride this dick to work, but just watch where you goin'
Take my time grippin' on her waist line
Started this at night now it's approachin' daylight

[Hook]
She says I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fiendin' for me, I can get it wet
She says I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

[Verse 2]
Don't nobody else compare the way Gates do you
Pull your hairs, smack your ass, knock your break shoes loose
Other lames take you out shoppin', dinner, and a movie
Suck your titty in the mirror with a finger in your booty
Top drop in a foreign, blowin' smoke up into Heaven
Right hand on your inner thigh, gently I'm caressin'
Say it make your pussy moist every time the engine revvin'
Gettin' dressed inside designer stores, you know how we be steppin'

[Hook]
She says I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fiendin' for me, I can get it wet
She says I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

[Bridge]
Gon' be a while before it's over
Don't say I didn't warn ya
I can't even lie girl, you the truth
Bedroom or the sofa, your legs around my shoulder
My attention, givin' all of it to you
It'll be an hour before it's over
Gon' be a while before it's over
I can't even lie girl, you the truth
Bedroom or the sofa, your legs around my shoulder
My attention, givin' all of it to you

[Hook]
She says I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one, alright
And I can go for hours, ain't believe me, had to show one, alright
See I prefer the floor, not the bed
Fiendin' for me, I can get it wet
She says I'mma dog, but it takes one to know one, alright

[Outro]
Let me see you work out
Let me see you work out, I love it when you work out
Let me see you work out
Let me see you work out, I love it when you work out
Let me see you work out
Let me see you work out, I love it when you work out
Let me see you work out
Let me see you work out, I love it when you work out
Ooh, that's it?
