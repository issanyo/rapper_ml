[First Verse]
Option the spring cleaner
Popular being seen
Talking candy I was thinking
Of aquamarine green
Serve by the empties
Throw it out tha window
I got work who tryin to get it
I’m going outta business
Drop your money off
I get my bitch to throw it out the window
Newman bought a box of Goodies
Blow it out the window
Phone ringing
“Midget man jus keep it gutter now you touch it you will kill it man”

Inconsiderate idiots consider me a rapper
Shitty how I’m pissing on the stitching in the mattress
Mentally bananas
Grippin on the cannon a lyricist God damnit
Can’t afford another injury
Meant to be riding Phantoms
Meant to be gettin clemency
Keep it street when you mention
Long nose in a choke hold
Smoke the top of your chimney

Quite - stay silent
To niggas with jive tendencies
Full-fledged runnin back
Nuttin like a Emmitt Smith
Need to see the green
For 22 like I’m Emmitt Smith
Feelin lit - Jumping out a Civic
What the business is
Seein sick signatures
Stick him leave him stickin like a window sill
Sip a lot of lean
Cough medicine fetish

Thought he was taught better
He talk reckless I wet him
Squeeze at a mosquito
Let’s all catch him to stretch him
Feel like I’m a lame
I walk with that aggression
Get him lost - o get crossed off
You better tell him

[Chorus]
Step up out the whip
Errbody lookin
Fake rappers sellin dope
Errrbody Cookin
Change on my brains
Ain’t nobody took it
Walk around like I’m a Giant
Feel like everybody pussy

See me in the club
Errrbody lookin
Kept it strong
When you right or wrong
Errrbody hookin
I ain’t trippin on them bitches
That’s errrbody pussy
Walk around like Imma Giant
Feel like everybody pussy

[Second Verse]
I said this already
Ice glisten nights lights
In the night life flight right
You listen twice

I’m so proud of my niggas
All this powder they flippin
I copped a house moved out
Then remodeled the kitchen

I be droppin consistent
Rockin a collar with tennis
You don’t want no money
You go shoppin
You poppin them skittles

Can’t see on side you
Without gridnin just watch
And you get it
And if I did then I’m most likely
I’m not who you figured

I’m just slightly content
With livin this obvious image
I ain’t want no part of this
You pussies invited me in it

Now my vitamins’ kickin in
And my vitals are lifted
Kevin Gates labeled me a great
By my title’s restricted
Blackberry phone
Watching me type in my lyrics
Read from the bible
Seeking vengeance
With innocent niggas
Bitches tell no lies
Automatic four five
Clutching on my genitals till I die
Say hello why

[Chorus]
Step up out the whip
Errbody lookin
Fake rappers sellin dope
Errrbody Cookin
Change on my brains
Ain’t nobody took it
Walk around like I’m a Giant
Feel like everybody pussy

See me in the club
Errrbody lookin
Kept it strong
When you right or wrong
Errrbody hookin
I ain’t trippin on them bitches
That’s errrbody pussy
Walk around like Imma Giant
Feel like everybody pussy
