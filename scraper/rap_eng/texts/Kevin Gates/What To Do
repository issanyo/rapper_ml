[Intro: UU & Kevin Gates]
Woah, man she really got me trippin' right now, like
I ain't never tripped this hard in my life
And my shoes are always tied
Maybe I should call up Lil Byron, you know?
He always knows what to do with the ladies
Yeah, I'm goin' in, yeah
Hello?

[Verse 1: UU]
Here I go again, yeah, getting all in my feelings
I can't help it, this girl is getting to my head
And I can't change it, it feels like this will never end
The thought of being without her just makes my heart stop
I go around try to hide it, tryna play it off
I didn't want this, I wanted us just to be friends
And I took the wrong advice, I should've waited instead
Tell me what I should say, tired of walking round everyday
Feeling some type of way
She didn't even wanna tell me how she really felt
I had to go around and find out from someone else
She think I don't know the truth, so I just go and play dumb
No, I can't be the only one that's going through this situation

[Hook: UU]
Please tell me what to do
Feels like my world's breaking in two
Everybody around me was tryna gas me up
I didn't know that if I did it, it would mess things up
When we're together things are not the same
Maybe I should've stayed in my own lane
When I talk to her I never know what to say
I just really wish that I could forget that day

[Verse 2: Lil Byron & UU]
I can tell you what you wanna hear
But that don't mean that the tension will disappear
You say things just ain't the same
I can hear it in your voice when you say her name
So my advice to you is don't stress about it
Don't let one girl get you down
There's plenty others around
As of matter of fact there's this one cute girl that's tryna
Get on with you bruh you better talk to her before I do
Man, Lil Byron, can you just be serious for one second?
I think things will return back to normal
Everything will be fine, you gotta give it some time
Just let this situation breathe
I can tell she wants things to go back to how it was before
But now she avoids the situation
This ends up being the topic of every conversation
I think you should leave it alone
Don't even waist your time tryna explain anymore

[Hook: UU]
Please tell me what to do
Feels like my world's breaking in two
Everybody around me was tryna gas me up
I didn't know that if I did it, it would mess things up
When we're together things are not the same
Maybe I should've stayed in my own lane
When I talk to her I never know what to say
I just really wish that I could forget that day
