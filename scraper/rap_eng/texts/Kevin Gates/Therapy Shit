[Intro]
We had some humps along the way
But the reward is in the journey
I'm in my bag

[Verse]
I left from global tours almost in my peak
To have to go and sit down in the clink just to reach
The peak again
Mad with prison guards turning keys
Mad with God why don't he answer me while on my knees
I'm in need, I believed
Life don't ever turn out how we want but I succeed
I hustled a little bit pursuing things which I achieved
I told my wife my plan, I also told her she can leave
She cried her eyes out then abruptly she disagreed
I had to talk in code while giving orders to the streets
Executive staff 2 board members they on my team
Execute affairs whenever matters get decreed
I played by the rule received my slot from out the bean
Big General nigga
Game literature giver
When you stand on nation business
This shit come before your children
This shit come before your feelings
Niggas shoving dick in my lil hoe I took no interest
Lost emotions on my last bid, past tense now I'm just pressured
Niggas shooting taking shots that don't leave no impression
Gates don't partake in folly and I don't get aggressive
Hang gliders move inside and if you hear it in pairs
Get your brains blowed out
Put your feet in the air
People under my stairs
Cold hearted my stare
Buy one hoe unprotected
Took some losses no question
But we only fear Allah walk anywhere no protection
By my father neglected, depression hit I must settle
Seeking love out in the slums and got embraced by the ghetto
Right leg under took some fire still got traces of metal
Upright independent feelings bitch we die it's whatever
That case you had it got deferred, you agreed to some telling
I lost some fights, I never told, I never fold under pressure
Took some time accepted mine go look it up for the record
Dead broke while in New Orleans people thought I was balling
Rented a black Maserati just for one of my artists
When Versace jewelry was hot I was the one who had bought it
Put the roof over your head when I had just had a daughter
Show me where I hated on you, backstabbed me too often
Dealing with the opps while I'm in California recording
Put you in a grey Camaro just invoice me I spent it
Paid Peppa that little money that we borrowed, remember
I stood up for you when they said you was messing with children
They say I'm signing sex offenders niggas right in my city
I told you fuck 'em just stay focused you gon blow any minute
Transition you played hard that's your defense mechanism
You still my favorite rapper though you let them turn you against me
Your really hurt I see your pain you dissing me cause you miss me
Your really hurt I see your pain you dissing me cause you miss me

[Outro]
Ain't nobody never loved you like me nigga
And you know that
When you sit around in a room
Remember one thing
If you can't be used you useless
Big Alsace
I been a General
