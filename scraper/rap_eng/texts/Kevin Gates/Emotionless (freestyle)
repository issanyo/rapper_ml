(Verse1)
Dear god tried church nothing came from it haze coverd pain troubled when stuck in a rain puddle
Same struggle when they judge you & tell you what you ain't posed to be
Disassociated what everything that was close to me
Element dealings with hard liquor leaving my liver scarred
Stealing cars, dealing hard sit up in the prison bars
Autograph prison guards fence, stand prison yards central-booking, rebooking then end up with a prison charge
This is crack in the making if i don't happen to make it
While drug trafficking & traveling thank god i made it
Alot of shit express my vessel propel heaters
Stan smith adidas possessing the shell feature
Dead game stock i came from a better bill don't love won't trust don't know if i ever will
If the ticket ain't legitimate you should a lose sight while you dance with the devil in the pale moon light

(Chorus)x2
Im so in love with these streets, sometimes i wear my heart on my sleeve im a G i believe
Day n day struggle alot of Hustler's come and go something out of nothing this the ghetto i come to know

(verse)2
I'd work it out (what you mean??) on the low sell yo from the hotel for coke sells & hoe sells dope
I can't get 4 the lowest i go is about a zone an up in & out of class like my summer wasn't long enough
Patrolling the corners im never on 'em long enough (but these nikkas mouth be???) they never seem to hold enough
Lesson learned if need be ima gett you whole shop after 12 gotta see me in the kitchen
Im might jus be a victim in a different situation if i can't get a appeal try to reconsideration
(whats a reconsideration??) quick give a illustration hard sentence, lawyers getting reconsiderated
Most first time offenders getting reconsiderated conviction over turned through invalidated statements
Nothing for the metal to breath till it breeze so when i say dont move bitch you better freeze

(chorus)x2
Im so in love with these streets, sometimes i wear my heart on my sleeve im a G i believe
Day n day struggle alot of Hustler's come and go something out of nothing this the ghetto i come to know
