[Hook]
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they wanna break one
Thought I heard somebody say they wanna break one

[Verse 1]
Me and my lil hoe, we be out in public
Catchin' feelin's, I be fuckin' her without no rubber
Kick a bitch ass, go to jail, beat up her brother
Disrespect me, I'ma die, that's just how I'm comin'
Shots fired, they just playin', they just might empty
Mic check, smash the gas, let the light catch 'em
Catch you with your clique and do somethin' bad
Talkin' shit that you was talkin' on the 'Gram
My momma taught me how to not be loyal to a woman
They gon' let your loyal partner rip when you not lookin'
Success is nothin', I'm thuggin', I'm goin' out my mind
When shawty brought that pressure you was scared to go outside
Talkin' bout me bad to Ciana but it's obvious
'Cause I'm gettin' cash like Ciana, buyin' property
I'm the truth, chosen one, couple niggas said it
Why you mad at Kevin Gates? Ain't you gettin' paper

[Hook]
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard

[Pre-Hook]
Show my ass, won't pull up my pants, let me do my dance
Show my ass, won't pull up my pants, let me do my dance
Show my ass, won't pull up my pants, let me do my dance
Show my ass, won't pull up my pants, let me do my dance

[Verse 2]
Look here boy, gimme that rod, I'm 'bout to step on somethin'
Got a house full of puppies, better not step on nothin'
Where these niggas was when I used to sell rocks?
Shoutout everybody in the working cell block
Me and Molly ah with the 30 round Glock
Breadwinner Ron party rockin' non-stop
Say you sorry, go let God forgive you, I don't hear ya
Note to self, them niggas ain't really fuckin' witcha
Note to self, them niggas been gettin' comfortable
Rap your ass off when you tired, that shit'll humble you
I don't get tired, when you tired it come from under you
Jump by, jump on songs, do what a grinder do
Cocaine in the streets, MC Hammer
Bumpin' the Steven Carol with the black bandana
C-Loc nigga, concentration camp anthem
Sippy you get jacked, kidnapped, held up for ransom

[Hook]
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard

[Bridge]
Jay Lewis, do the Jay Lewis, watch that Geaux Yella
Margielas, bumpin' gold yellow with a cold Stella
Jay Lewis, do the Jay Lewis, watch that Geaux Yella
Margielas, bumpin' gold yellow with a cold Stella

[Hook]
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Thought I heard somebody say they was a bread winner
Got it out the mud and I got it hard
All praise be to God, fuck a bodyguard
