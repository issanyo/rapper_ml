[Intro]
Life story for life story, ya heard me
I don't never lie to y'all about nothin'
Mane shit fucked up right now man
I'm going back to Hunts
I know they was goin' do me up, I swear to God mane
Leave all that in there

[Verse 1]
Okay three months behind on rent but my P.O. I paid em'
Just thought I'd warn you, when I'm broke I turn into a gangsta
My dawg got it, told em pop it, say he can't afford it
Lord forgive me, if he tempt me, I might have to force him
Two pair of drawers, when I'm thuggin', back to jail I'm comin'
So I can have a pair to rock, toilet wash the other
Two kids a week apart, and on the way another baby
My hoes pretend they love me
All my baby mamas hate me
I know my dawg see me starvin' while his pockets swollen
In the club, poppin' bottles, I just can't ignore it
Know he got it, told em pop it, now he can't afford it
Lord forgive me, if he tempt me, I might have to force him

[Hook]
I just want some money, I I just want some money,I I just want some money  I(You know how I'm comin')
I just want some money, I I just want some money I
Head first behind the bread (You know how I'm comin')
Doing bad, flat broke, ain't a thang to say
Look out for your dawg, got u when I get it straight
Doing bad, flat broke, ain't a thang to say
Look out for your dawg, I got u when I get it straight

[Verse 2]
The drug habit through the roof, mane you know what's happenin'
Every bitch that love me, bank account in overdraft, (What's with all the excuses, you gon' do it or don't?)
I know everybody I owe, I owe everybody I know
Then that same nigga I told, went told everybody I know (Damn)
Dr-dr-dressing bummy, catching rides, it got disgusting
Passenger side in public, women, won't give up they number
Talkin' ballin', then you oughtta toss it on the muscle
Won't break it off, might just have to break him off for nothin'
Ain't lookin good but maybe,I just ran out of patience
All around me papers, ain't nothin' straight girl
God forgive me prayin'
Feel like I'm hatin' on em'
He don't wanna give it up, I might have to take it from em'(hey yo)

[Hook]
I just want some money, I I just want some money,I I just want some money  I(You know how I'm comin')
I just want some money, I I just want some money I
Head first behind the bread (You know how I'm comin')
Doing bad, flat broke, ain't a thang to say
Look out for your dawg, got u when I get it straight
Doing bad, flat broke, ain't a thang to say
Look out for your dawg, I got u when I get it straight

[Outro]
All these old bitch ass niggas runnin' round this bitch ballin'
Yeah this song ain't for you
Spoken outro
Yeah 2014 I'mma take control of the reins
