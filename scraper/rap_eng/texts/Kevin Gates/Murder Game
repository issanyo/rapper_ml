The streets know the real ballers hanging with a nigga
I ran through them cuts and hallways with them killas
7 you can get the 2-50
Stone had the best cocaine in the city
I came up in a dangerous environment
Kept a cutta close cause you niggas do the most
Foreign cars pullin up thats money on your block
Thats them bread winners got them bitches by the flock
If you bout yo hustle I gots bs white and purple
We cookin dope, bet not play cause I'll hurt you
OG boobie black I'm in love with the game
If that bitch do you wrong do that bitch the same thang

Yeah thats yo nigga what you gone do about him
Another nigga killed em and the hood knew about it
Pressure on you nigga ain't no time to think none
Better ride for yo nigga put the murder game down
You a bitch nigga should've stay on the porch
Got up in the game and dont even know the sport
Ride for yo nigga thats how the game go
If you fall on yo nigga you's a mothafuckin hoe
