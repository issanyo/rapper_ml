[Hook: Wissel]
Through all the times in my life
Through all the things that's not right
I need to know
Who's got love for me?

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
It's kind of cold coming up
Outside looking in
When my room and my clothes and my shoes look like shit
Couldn't understand, they don't look in my direction
But the money made it make sense
They look in my direction
It's crooked in my section
Everybody gossiping
People show me love trying to make some dollars off of me
Let me lose my voice bitch
Your ho will stop calling me
Rap game, trap game
Dope will commodity
My folks broke a car for me
Order be mislead
Family pointing fingers now they boarder me for bread
Ain't nothing let me say it
Fuck me a nigga
Hard to trust my own blood
How could I trust me a nigga
A lady once told me, you dying to go to hell
Nigga trying to get rich, not trying to go to jail
So when love gets shown it's hard to find with it
I'm really mentally torn, can't identify with it

[Hook: Wissel]
Through all the times in my life
Through all the things that's not right
I need to know
Who's got love for me? [x2]

[Verse 2: Wissel]
If it wasn't for these [?]
I can't recall when I was broke that you cocksuckers [?]
Or when I was locked you sent me change to buy a soap
Now every mother fucker want to call me they round
They heard how I sound now everybody want to be down
I ain't the same nigga but I bless them like a rapper
Lord knows I [?] the name of Jesus get the [?]
Before I grab this weapon, [?]
You better tell them Kevin, in the South I'm a legend
And I'm bout what I'm about
Inside and out
The shit I speak about make a real nigga shout
Loves a strong thing
Smoking a show
Love me a [?]
That's the way love goes [x5]
Nigga

[Hook: Wissel]
Through all the times in my life
Through all the things that's not right
I need to know
Who's got love for me? [x2]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
GET EM' GATES
Kevin Gates got arrested
Heard he's on his way to jail
I ain't tryna hate
That nigga fake
I hope he stay in jail
Know he can fight and his girl doing bad
Man keep holding your nuts
I know niggas don't like me
Moaning around me flyer than your whole life be
Pints getting poured up
Lean getting roasted
Shirts at the concert
Drink getting toasted
Dreads hang neatly and the belt game lethal
Gurt getting dead and the health came freely
Confusing for a minute thinking hatred ain't needed
Mind state in a blind state and mine ain't greedy
Nigga gave me access, bricks coming through
Doing chickens like my women I could flip one with you
Got my people out the way I'ma sit on a few
Man nigga gave me access, them bricks coming through
Oh forgot I said that, ok whips coming through
BELIEVE THAT
