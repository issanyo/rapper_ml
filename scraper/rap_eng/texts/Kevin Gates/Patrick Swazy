[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Man, what's happenin'?
(One hunnid)
This Luca Brasi right here talkin', ya heard me?
I'm all the way out my mind
I'm all the way retarded
And just for the record, that nigga son started that word "Keisha."

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Patrick Swazy, (Who?) Patrick Swazy
Everything white, starting to think I'm racist
Patrick Swazy, (Who?) Patrick Swazy
Put up back to back, all my whips Caucasian
Patrick Swazy, (Who?) Patrick Swazy
Work, Styrofoam cup, color purple drankin'
Patrick Swazy, (Who?) Patrick Swazy
Shooter, Whoopi Goldberg dreads, Jamaican, Haitians

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Pronto, bricks be coming blanco
Girls Scout cookies, New York Knick hat
Blue with the orange like a Denver Bronco
Conoco, Conoco
See policia El repita
Vamonos! Vamonos!
Where the big booty hoes where I'mma go
Nigga outta line blap blap that llama blow
Gotta know
Pronto, bricks be coming blanco

Conoco, Conoco
See policia El repita
Vamonos! Vamonos!
Where the big booty hoes where I'mma go
Nigga outta line blap blap that llama blow
Gotta know, I'mma blow
Thumbing through a check
Bread winner sweats when I'm jumpin off the jet
Another nigga bitch, another nigga vet
Vagina kind of wet, in the bottom of the bed
[...] I'm Brett Favre-ing
Fire arm I'm serving quarters
Eighty-four from the tech, put the nine to your neck
Randy Moss or Peter Walric, them retarded

[Verse 2: Dreco]
Million dollar nigga, my hood still claim me
No matter the money, I ain't never change
Make one call, 100 Gang pull up sprayin
Hundred round drum, fuck that, we ain't aiming
All white gold, call it Phantom of the Opera
Nigga what it be? I'm retarded with that chopper
Hood love me like a nigga Big Poppa
I am a gangster boo! So show me where the dollars

[Hook: Kevin Gates]

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Pull up on side me, (Who that?) Dreco that look like Mazi
Wait that's Menace, they switched whips, got a bad bitch in it with hair extensions
Got a black extension (And what?)
And forty (You trippin son)
Retarded! That's what they call me
Don't know what to call it
Tip-tronic foreign, I'm shifting a 'rari
Eat pussy good and I fuck like a doggy
On all fours in front me, well that's like a horsey
Haters don't bother me I'm who they wanna be
Chip with no tip, you pissed off what you oughta be
Say you ain't trippin but take this for instance
Your chick is on Twitter and all her friends follow me
Chick with the wallabies want me to stop, screamin and hollering
Treat her like Pac, Believe it or not
