[Intro]
Blessed is the man that walks not in the council of the ungodly
Behold, I send you out as sheep amidst the wolves

[Hook]
Broken rib, I'm operational. Attention Operator
Laboratory is a kitchen stove, look who's operatin'
Oh, its for real though, Ill probably be this way for life
Oh, its for real though, Made a few nickels off the white
She like
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
You really miss someone you love, hold up a lighter

[Verse 1]
Muzzles black on the tip, runnin' back on a bitch
Put me in or I flip, grab rock and run an assist
Crossed without crossing lines, would suggest that I'm on my shit
Be not blinded, time allotted for grindin', that's all I get
All I give is maybe, simple solutions to those in debt
Tried to pimp me, simply broke out a Frisbee and told em fetch
I'm a dog, brain ain't on the same page that you lames on
Ate off the plate that the un-removable stains on
Speakin' of removable, send a few of my shooters through, maneuver through
Where your people kick it and remove a few
Say his girls a harlot, and he responded
"Gates Im through with you."
Back to removable, BLAOW had to remove a tooth

[Hook]
Broken rib, Im operational. Attention Operator
Laboratory is a kitchen stove, look who's operatin'
Oh, its for real though, Ill probably be this way for life
Oh, its for real though, Made a few nickels off the white
She like
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
You really miss someone you love, hold up a lighter

[Verse 2]
Inner city in which I grew up, no running from problems
The W, docker bottoms, rockin socks and the collar
On side of Roxy, actin lessons and a spiced tomato
Rocky touchin twelve ounces, chargin nothin to rob him
Im in Atlanta but my mind in Los Angeles
The 'rari reciprocates lost my mind in Los Angeles
Ferrari California
Ferrari California
Hit the weed, tat my neck
Then his sleeves, not a chest
Slingin D, You can't tell?
Lookin' mean, Ain't I fresh?
Free my nigga, Tedrick Shavers
Eric Banks, I love to death
Hourly consumption round you kifflin women got me vexed
CTC! What that mean?
Mean you need to cut the check

[Hook]

I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
I hold us down no matter what, cause Im a rider
