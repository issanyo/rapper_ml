Kevin Gates (hook):
In the fast lane I'm getting money
Run it up, run it up
And I ain't no way on earth you take it from me
Let's get this understood
On the block I love my hood
Every night I fight for dollars
When it's bad I grind about it
My bitch gonna find the problem
Pay her no mind about it
My bills paid in advance and if not we dyin about it
No time to cry about it
And it ain't no backing out
Extension out the mac, blat, blat, blat and back it up
Real street nigga man

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Street nigga won't flex, see the jects, hit the fence
How we came up in that bottom
Drop top, top drop free my nigga, Lil Sprite
When he touch down I got em
Pledge allegiance to the to the money counter
2000 racks is on the fucking counter
Bitch you with don't give a fuck about her
Fucked her good but nothing done about it

Hard to slap with nothin but traffic me
Narco trafficante, we a thousand
Cocaine on a table, fuckin mountain
Pouring syrup like a fucking fountain
Faucet orange, nigga prolly snoring
Nigga, Luca Brasi got the auction going
Plays the floor, I had a daily dose
You wanna pop the toaster when our pot be blowin
Shake back, rerock, shake back
Diddy in the kitchen water whippin nigga take that
Gates strap ,waste that, sitting on the step
No bulletproof vest where the apes at, ate that
Stay cooking, nigga straight pussy
Try to take it from me I'ma face book them
Hit the line, Lito got 5 niggas
He supply green, I supply chickens

In the fast lane I'm getting money
Run it up, run it up
And I ain't no way on earth you take it from me
Let's get this understood
On the block I love my hood
Every night I fight for dollars
When it's bad I grind about it
My bitch gonna find the problem
Pay her no mind about it
My bills paid in advance and if not we dyin about it
No time to cry about it
And it ain't no backing out
Extension out the mac, blat, blat, blat and back it up
Real street nigga, man

Came up on the dumb shit
Ak with the jay clip
Trey eight in the club with me
You can show love but don't fuck with me
I had little rocks and a plastic bag
We was chasing cars that was back to back
One of the few who's reps is figure
If I only know it some activists
Trash bags right now I'm texting for this
And I'm too strapped to relax
Two heats even know it's just me
And I fit in the front, big mac in the back
Got a bitch so bad all she do is nag
Told her put it in your name
Now I ride paper till she hate me like a fake bed
Hood rich real shit
I prolly look poor in a foreign
Me and Gates sit in the foreign one leader
Literally pouring the form
Afford to be on me, at 4 in the morning
Out of time just get a show
Speed, gotta get back though
I got court in the morning, true story

In the fast lane I'm getting money
Run it up, run it up
And I ain't no way on earth you take it from me
Let's get this understood
On the block I love my hood
Every night I fight for dollars
When it's bad I grind about it
My bitch gonna find the problem
Pay her no mind about it
My bills paid in advance and if not we dyin about it
No time to cry about it
And it ain't no backing out
Extension out the mac, blat, blat, blat and back it up
Real street nigga, man

45 on my hit double
Through the projects like Jesse James
Flamed up, never changed up
Rep the same block and same gang
4 dudes, zero zero I'm a hood hero
Off moving kilos in a tress spot
With them straps out
Bout 100 ounces in gladlocks
Hot dog get the backdoor, got a haunted nigga on hood jo
Grab one of her affiliated
Got cash money knocking at my door
Hold up I don't trust nigga
If I show love I fucks with you
I grind hard with all star
With a pain lean in a foreign car
Real shit, all of my people on trill shit
Riding round screaming rock town
Like how do you feel bitch

In the fast lane I'm getting money
Run it up, run it up
And I ain't no way on earth you take it from me
Let's get this understood
On the block I love my hood
Every night I fight for dollars
When it's bad I grind about it
My bitch gonna find the problem
Pay her no mind about it
My bills paid in advance and if not we dyin about it
No time to cry about it
And it ain't no backing out
Extension out the mac, blat, blat, blat and back it up
Real street nigga, man
