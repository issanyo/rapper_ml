[Verse 1]
Pussy good, soaking wet
She say if I give her dick away she'll be so upset
Argumentative, but not with me, it seems I stroke her best
4th quarter pressure tongue kissin' while I stroke her breasts
Lick her nipples, spread her pussy lips
Slipping off Vicky secret panties rubbin' on her clit
Legs open suckin' on her clit
Situation in the naked never get enough of this

[Hook]
Would you mind, would you mind, would you mind, would you mind
I'll be your soldier, I can stroke you
In slow motion for a really long time, time, time
After you bend over I'mma grip your waist and shoulders
Kiss and hold you for a while, a while, a while, a while
When your legs around me I get high and I don't wanna come down
Some might say I'm disrespectful, I regret it in not asking
Would you mind, would you mind, would you mind, would you mind
If I pull over and I fuck you in the bathroom stall for a while
Would you mind, would you mind, would you mind, would you mind
If I pull over and I fuck you in the bathroom stall for a while

[Verse 2]
Dedication, I'm dedicated
Lean with the weed, this is weed, heavily sedated
Rhythmic patterns seem to scatter, you my meditation
Ill, the way I feel when you not here, you my medication
T-shirt, clothes seen
Addiction got you itching for a hit, dope fiend
Clothes on the floor by the door, no joking
Hours in the shower, no towels, more steam
Body paint under fluorescent lights, glow in the dark
And love out the tub with the way you bend over and arch
Pussy in my verse, then reverse, throw it in park
Sexin' in the bathroom on a jet, we closer to God

[Hook]
