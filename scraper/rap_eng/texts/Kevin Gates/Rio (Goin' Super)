[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Nights out in Rio
Now we catching flights spending nights out in Rio
Nights out in Rio
Now we catching flights spending nights out in Rio

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Fall off in the VIP and drink up all the liquor
Official with the shoulder play, my shooter ain't gon' miss you
Thank a Nigga playing
Watch I go pick up little Mr, I just hate when Nigga's mouth off
That's when the pistol pop off
Now it's 25 for be real, hit the track up
Pussy don't want paying fuck it
I'ma beat the slack up
Act like he ain't catched that
How dare a Nigga act up?
Clown talking down
BLOWN BLOWN
Make em' back up
Stopping off in Dixie, you know Brian got the hook up
Shawty say I'm sexy, shit
I just got off them push ups
Plus I'm screenin' calls, into stalking
I don't need them
Bend a dawg, I don't like the way they talking
I delete em

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
My fit game official
My kick game official
Hard to see what's on your wrist but look at mine, he official
My dick game official
Exclusive every time
Exclusive every time
It's exclusive every time

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
We got it off the block hustle breaking down them kilos
Now we catching flights, spending nights out in Rio
Nights out in Rio
Nights out in Rio
Now we catching flights spending nights out in Rio

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Do me a lil team
I don't fuck around the sell out
Pressure get the pressing a lot of pussy Niggas sell out
Quick to point a finger
God know a name bell out
Tell out
Pillow talk with hoes, trick and mell out
Passing through the bottom
The fuck with buck on the killy
Meet your girl on Carolina, she feel the wood in her kidneys
Gucci belt with Polo boxers
Forever sagging my britches
I don't love them, I just shove them and nook will give them the business
Pocket full of knots and
Probably got on the skinnies
I tried to make them believe
And the probably just got them picture

I'm goin' super, goin' super..
I be ballin for real
Goin' super, goin' super
Goin' super, goin' super
I be ballin for real and you don't know what it is

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
My fit game official
My kick game official
Hard to see what's on your wrist but look at mine, he official
My dick game official
Exclusive every time
Exclusive every time
It's exclusive every time
