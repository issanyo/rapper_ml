[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
There go Brassi man
What's your name again?
Where I know you from
I think I know your friends
Not her your other one
I been burning limbs
Wanna hit the blunt?
Sippin' out the cup
I could give you some
And my dick a fool
Let me give you some
Been had wanted you
Not no hit and run
And my mouth dogs
Lick you with my tongue
Don't undermine me
I be goin' dumb
Hold up watch your step, please don't step on me
You don't see I'm fresh
Handle carefully
Polo underwear got from Beverly
Designer stores I do that separately
What kind of drink you want? That's not my concern
Tell me when you cum? Let me get my turn
Why you running from me? Tell me what you heard
Mouth full of diamonds
I be slangin' birds
I be in the hood
I supply the curb
And I got a mansion
Somewhere in the burbs
Bring you to my spot
Bet not say a word
Rippin' off your shirt
Make your body jerk
Baby move your body
I won't tell nobody
Dancing like Rihanna
Make your body work
I can stand behind you
Pin you to the counter
Listen to you holla

[Chorus: Wash]
I look for you my whole life
Baby where you been
I came here with my home boys
Tell me you got friends
Never thought I meet someone like you, but then I did
Tell me where you been
Baby tell me where you been
I done looked my whole life baby where you been
Promise I hold you down girl through the thick and thin
Never thought I meet someone like you, but then I did
Tell me where you been
Baby tell me where you been
Where you been
