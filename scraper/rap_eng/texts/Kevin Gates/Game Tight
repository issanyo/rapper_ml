[Chorus]
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed

[Verse 1]
Fuck no - I ain’t no new jack
Since 88 I knew crack
Temper through the roof
A nigga blew on me
I blew back
Hoes used to call me blue black
Money helped me through that
Started ? and outgrew that
My mind was like fight
It’s the battle of your life
It’s cold up in this real world
Niggas want stripes
Never bark but don’t bite
Never scratch and don’t hit
Nigga try to play ya sideways
Runoff in his shit
Never fall for a bitch
Less the bitch make ends
Look know you from the streets
So you ain’t goin' have no friends
Keep it loaded keep it cocked
Nigga keep it off safety
I’ll be a motherfucker if I let a nigga waste me
Place me six feet under no remorse
To make my mama cry
And get all shaky in her voice
To see my kids struggle
Like I did in the south
Imma lay em on a stretcher
‘for I let em take me out

[Verse 2]
First apologies to my bitch
And all the nights I spent away
Afraid of having sex
For fear I might just give her aids
My pockets and my contraband
A focus of my happiness
Reaching for a mill
Getting closer just to grabbing it
I prolly heard words of wisdom
Didn’t receive it
Vision - I’m the reason
Couldn’t come to believe it
My mother - steady grieving
I'mma underachiever
And I’m the one they call
When them guns get to squeezing
My brother - ain’t sleeping
My cousin - ain’t either
What is love re-define
I don’t understand the meaning
Feelings never care
My father was never there
React - regret later
Gates never scared
My life been a bitch
Hold a nigga - willing I fuck her
She go to squealin'
To let me know she feel it
She grab the pillow and grip it
I rub her clit and titties
Screaming Gates God damn
Show your ass
This is a set up

[Chorus]
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed

[Verse 3]
My nerve got a way with words
Itching to speak
Pen line from the grind
On the tip of my teeth
My money from a different standpoint
It’s on the up and up
Fuck him he’s selling cut
Imma customer Imma touch him up
My bitch getting cussed out
Niggas getting punched out
Missed call “Rastaman - boo wot ya fuss about”
Read it on the other end
Hammer dead flushed out
Bye to the bus only let you know
What trust about
Fully loaded detachable stock on the machine
Right underneath my armpit
I hold up the team
My Glock on everything
A pop better believe it
You don’t go in the box [?]
Doc see medical region
Shot better than breathing
I’m guessing this evening
Betting on Marquita
To drop letters to Reezy
Shot better than breathing
I’m guessing this evening
Betting on Marquita
To drop letters to Reezy

[Chorus]
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed
Game tight - simplest form - street nigga
Complexity- different with arms - squeeze triggers
Steady looking at God
Trapped in these ways
Rap to get paid
Or death and get sprayed
