Oh I think I like her, really think I like her
I'm not impolite but I gotta get behind her
See the way she whine move her body like a spider
Ain't finished the end yet, I wish I could rewind her

[Verse]
In the party on VIP, don't drink
Have a seat, come be around me for the night
Feelin' my stee', see what you like
If I be myself I could be what you like
Me not trying to be misleading
Tell me if I'm perceiving you right
The club is the way you releasing and everybody knows that we all need relief in our life
Man in your life mistreating you right
Really need somebody like me in your life
I should be your therapist
Really does seem like I'm reading you SIKE
Tame women, I'm a game spitter, this mouth piece is my ammunition
This dick so good it would have you wishin'
And at the same time it might have you missin'
Bae, I ain't about to grab you listen, I'm honest
This might have you trippin'
Got a main line if she catch me slippin' with other women then that's your issue (Aye)
I'm throw'd off
Said everything but take your clothes off
Like that don't match, take those off
Like oh girl your body's so soft
Just a thought, can't hustle a hustler
Come in or nothing, one or the other
Fondle' yourself, ? in public
Do know the subject, answer the question
Got you feelin' like love in the club
Let me take her to the house have a love in the tub
Hit you from the back got you huffing and puffin'
I'm up in your guts and whats up (Aye)

[Hook: x2]
Oh I think I like her, really think I like her
I'm not impolite but I gotta get behind her
See the way she whine move her body like a spider
Ain't finished the end yet, I wish I could rewind her
