[Verse 1]
Got me saying god, please bless my life
Keep a weapon but it's only to protect my life
Shirt bulking round the shoulders so the vest ain't right
Forever me, I ain't never freeze
Nigga play the deeze at ease
Twin sees in the Benz
See me where the devil be
Dope game brutal
Money slower than usual
Plug say it's cool but it moves slower than usual
Then my dog always told me don't never abuse it
One moment you got it
Next moment you lose it
Like I'm raw with the rap
And a fool with the music
My niggas will turn they back
First moment I lose it
Start laughing
"What happened?"
Like it's fucking amusing
They telling me to 'Chill, the street game is nothing. You 'pose to be on stage with T.Pain and Usher. Magazine cover. Me, Wayne and Busta. Then you walk around with like 10 chains and pumps"

[Hook]
Smell like burnt rubber
I know what's cooking on the pipes
Say you look disgusting
Don't make me put it in your life
I'm just looking for a vice
I ain't looking for advice
I done did a lot of wrong
I'm just looking for a right

[Verse 2]
Kevin Gates for president
Told a lot of guaps
Show my ass, got harassed by a motorcycle cop
They go wee-o-wee-o-wee
Looking at my watch
Started walkin' off then they ordered me to stop
My man, god damn
Why you pulling out your Glock?
I ain't popping, I ain't chewing
I'm just vibing to the music
Now they like the song say
Getting wylin' stupid
I don't be resitting them
I don't know how y'all be
Where I room something going on
Not on ya'll street
'Gates look out for your bran'
Yeah you know how y'all be
I was doing bad shit
You niggas ain't call me
Few niggas be mad but a few niggas be walking
Heard you got a show
Who put out a flyer?
Different whips, with your bitch
I am not a driver
I am not an action figure
Do not need a side kick
Rich, now they hold my dick
Like it was a side kik

[Hook x2]
Smell like burnt rubber
I know what's cooking on the pipes
Say you look disgusting
Don't make me put it in your life
I'm just looking for a vice
I ain't looking for advice
I done did a lot of wrong
I'm just looking for a right
