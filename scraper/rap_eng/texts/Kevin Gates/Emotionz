[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Got these bricks in motion (motion)
Got these whips in motion (motion)
Got your bitch in motion (motion)
Niggas catch emotions (niggas too emotional)
Got this work in motion (motion)
Got this dope in motion (motion)
Got these hoes in motion (motion)
Bitches catch emotions (too emotional)
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions

[Verse 1: Derez De'Shon]
I'm sick and tired of emotions (emotions)
Bitches textin' me with emojis
Get over it, I don't want you, it's over (man it's over)
Bitch stop calling my phone (man)
Leave me 'lone, bitch be gone (bye)
In my zone, and I'm gone (gone)
Blow another pack of that strong, I be long long gone
Outta my mind, been on my grind
Niggas been hatin' me for a long time
You too emotional, nigga stop crying (bitch ass nigga)
And when I drop the top off I get topped off
Got a red ho hotter than hot sauce
You get mad when she dropped off
But won't say shit 'cause I'll pop off (uh huh)
And I don't play with niggas (nah)
Nah I don't play with niggas (I don't play it bitch)
I'd never love a ho
'Cause nah I don't play with feelings
One minute you love me (okay)
Next minute you don't, what's wrong
All that emotional bullshit
You carry ya ass home (damn!)

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Got these bricks in motion (motion)
Got these whips in motion (motion)
Got your bitch in motion (motion)
Niggas catch emotions (niggas too emotional)
Got this work in motion (motion)
Got this dope in motion (motion)
Got these hoes in motion (motion)
Bitches catch emotions (too emotional)
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Emotions come some time, backwards in my mind
Hard to think about the past, so I don't press rewind
Best friends jealous of my success
Like hoe's they show emotion
Standin' over niggas, killer, send 'em, no emotion
Band-Aids on my fingertips, gloves on when I'm grippin
Signature SIG or the pistol grip end of the Smith &, niggas don't listen
I been pissed on, fucked over, women playin' me close
Came around, they hid the weed when I had no money on smoke
Made jokes like I wouldn't catch 'em, tellin' hoes that I'm broke
But I know everybody I owe, I owe everybody I know
Mama prayin' hard for me, get these demons off of me
When you been through what I been through in the streets, it make it hard to sleep

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Got these bricks in motion (motion)
Got these whips in motion (motion)
Got your bitch in motion (motion)
Niggas catch emotions (niggas too emotional)
Got this work in motion (motion)
Got this dope in motion (motion)
Got these hoes in motion (motion)
Bitches catch emotions (too emotional)
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions

[Verse 3: Derez De'Shon]
Your ho is an emotional roller coaster
I'm a coaster, I'ma coach her
If she wanna die, I'm rope her
Deepthroat her, I'ma choke her and then stroke her
She get high, she a roller
On the molly, bustin' boulders
I'm a baller up on the sofa
Wake the pussy up like Folgers, I'ma fold her
Lick syrup off her areola, so many colors, it's like Crayola
In my Styrofoam, so high I'm on, Mars
I don't fuck with them bars
Singin' like El DeBarge, I'm high

[Chorus: Derez De'Shon]
Got these bricks in motion (motion)
Got these whips in motion (motion)
Got your bitch in motion (motion)
Niggas catch emotions (niggas too emotional)
Got this work in motion (motion)
Got this dope in motion (motion)
Got these hoes in motion (motion)
Bitches catch emotions (too emotional)
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions
Emotions, emotions, emotions
I hate dealin' with emotions
