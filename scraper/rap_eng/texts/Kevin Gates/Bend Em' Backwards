Gates, Rock wieler
Gates, Gates

[Hook]
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward

I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x 2]

[Verse 1]
Hugh
Dead game, exhibition a paper
Brick a brick down then create a recreation
My situation perhaps
My innocent love affair
Manipulated emotion enable me not to care
Hmm
Flored killing
Everybody watching me
She asked me to buy her drink then danced on the top of me
Pause for a minute, push her ass to the ceiling
They tend to act bad when there's cash in the building
Gates
She was breaking her neck to look at us
Girl I touched the tattoo on this neck
Ridiculous
Not to mention I'm probably to inclined for your mind if you listen
You probably got aroused playing slippers in the kitchen
Before the blind fold, never knew as much attention
Truth to said a dare to afraid to show your [?]
A lot of dick in her deep tissue massage
Accompanied by a freak can only be a minaj

[Bridge]
I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x 2]

[Verse 2]
I like the way when she rock, her hips
Squeal under pressure
Do it in the mirror with your heals on the dresser
Nigga go to talking about money you ought to listen
Paper by the stack
Could back Georgia pacific
Sitting in the car, twisting my cigar
Sick of rad bitches, they don't listen in the car
Not to mention in the car
When the business get bizarre
Your nipples got erect when he was unzipping your bra
Aye

Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward

[Verse 3]
Mr Gates
He never pull his pants up
If they don't give me space
I'm leaving here hand cuffed
Northern light kush
Believe I'm a star
B bought the picture booth
And T bought the bar

[Hook]
I ain't use to this, she put her ass on me
If she do it, baby stick it
Do it fast for me
Say I might as well sag my pants everywhere I go
You know I'ma show my ass everywhere I go

I ain't use to this
They make it rain for you
Strip tease, drop change on the stage for you [x4]
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward, bend em' backward, bend em' backward
Hit them from behind me I go bend em' backward
I wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, wallaby, bend em' backward
