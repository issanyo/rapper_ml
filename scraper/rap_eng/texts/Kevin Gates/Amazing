[Verse 1]
I don't eat bacon, order steak and eggs
I'm picky, picking over chicken like a set of legs
I eat sushi and that honey butter sweat bread
You just started eating coochi
Don't let me say it
I am not kidding
That's why I stopped kissing
I am not dissing
Bright women pussy stank
All you niggas fuck the same hoes
Come on what you think?
Getting home, tryna wipe it off before my girl smell it
Why you think I'm tryna wipe it off?
Because your girl smelly
And my girl smell it
Stupid mother fucker
Know it's confusing, I be losing mother fuckers
Probably to inclined for your mind
Stupid mother fuckers
They say it's my turn to eat, I say It's been the time
I hold my city down winter time to winner time
Producers give me food to chew, hmm
Dinner time
And it ain't nothing else to do
Now it's killin time

[Bridge]
My grandmother use to tell me a long time ago, she used to pull me to the side
She'd say "Baby, sometimes talking to you be like talking to a brick wall. But you never cease to amaze me. You're amazing."

[Verse 2]
Jumping out the top of that thing, my dreads shaking
No look like Shabba Ranks, manna' talk like a Jamaican
You know can do what I can do, why you 'ating?
Try and get the money up too, real impatient
Thirty in the party
Hardly mean a ting
Manna' badman
You want to see my dingaling?
Dingalingaling
Wiggling me dingaling
You do the same if you ain't got a brain
Wiggle your dingaling
Jump in the Luc with Newman
He got a thing for green
Pick up the phone, call Bone
Yo I need the lean
My little nigga Level
Niggas ain't on your level
Get your change, don't change
Keep the city under pressure
Brice doing 6
Boobie coming home
Wayne had stacks
Smash the lack in a mc
Play the side line see the ties when they ride by
I don't hate, love to see you shine
Get your ride fly

[Bridge]
A lot of people don't know this
I jumped off the porch when I was like 14, 15
Head first in the game
Used to have fun rapping and shit
But me? I more looked at boxing like my ticket out the hood

[Verse 3]
Walking home from practice had a talk with Big London
Told him what it was and got the hook up on them onions
Whole block bumping
Traffic start coming
That other boy was passing through but wasn't sellin' nothin'
My favorite rapper Big Head, couldn't tell me nothin'
Buckzey came home, had the rap game lovely
Time Reezy came home I had a trap in the bottom
Then I told Tome I'd never turn my back on the bottom, got em
