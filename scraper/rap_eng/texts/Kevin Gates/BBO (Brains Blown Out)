[Intro]
People are gifted in, different aspects of life and
Certain things that we choose to do as individuals
Hinder us from doing other things
Don't be mad at me for being the best at what I was created to be
I love you, you know what I'm sayin', ? real talk

[Verse 1]
As projected, I'm on the winning team, illest in the league
Seemingly hate to disagree, a tendency to leave
If it's me and it's something I hindered, enabled to breathe
You could leave and go make an adventure, get down on my knees
Tell you that I love you, but you not returning my call
Made an appointment, you no longer answer at all
I get around, but I can't forget about it
And tell that other lame that's enough to get his brains blown out
Body shape is amazing
Conversations relate to the place that I used to stay in
Sweet street talk, love the way that we talk
Edible pleasure, eat you then tease you with teeth marks

[Hook]
I'mma keep it street, 'bout as street as can be
It's illegal for to steal a niggas feelings then leave
I get around, but I can't forget about it
And tell that other lame that's enough to get his brains blown out

[Verse 2]
Situation made me take a vacation, I went to jail
Keep in touch, love letters, I'm touching you through the mail
Masturbation in my mind, like I'm fucking you in the cell
Even booked you on a visit (You're crazy) you know me well
Seems we a lot alike, I mean a lot alike
Lonely when alone at night, I'm promisin' I'm never lettin' go
Ship sinking, I'm clinging on, Leonardo decaprio

[Break]
Try I, nights cry, BWA, a way of life
Speaking with my ambition
God speed in the street
May he be with my nigga Menace
