[Chorus]
What if God was one of us (What if God was one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Looking for love in the club like one of us (In the club)
Tryna make it out the slums like one of us (Slums like one of us, aw yeah)
What if God is one of us (What if God is one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Getting it out the mud like one of us (Out the mud)
Making calls to the plug like one of us

[Verse 1]
Makin' calls to the plug (hello?)
I'm tryna ball, goin' hard, I'm not ballin' enough (score)
I got scars on my heart, come from fallin' in love (don't fall)
On my knees every night placin' calls up above
Seems like God won't pick up
If Heaven won't show me a way (show me the way)
Guide me when I grip the weight
'Cause in the city we livin' in
It's kill or you gettin' killed
I was taught to keep it real
Misguided in the field (come here)
Boom boom pop bang bang
Forgive me I done gripped the steel (woo)
She the devil, she was bad, long weave, buku ass
Round enough, make pretty faces when I'm hittin' her from the back
And I got caught and I ain't rat, some buku guys she ain't hit back
I done been to hell and back, 'cause I done been to jail and back

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us (What if God was one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Looking for love in the club like one of us (In the club)
Tryna make it out the slums like one of us (Slums like one of us, aw yeah)
What if God is one of us (What if God is one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Getting it out the mud like one of us (Out the mud)
Making calls to the plug like one of us

[Verse 2]
Makin' calls to the plug, I fell off then got up
I'm standin' tall no matter what, real nigga never budge
Thinkin' y'all shall not judge while I stood in front the judge
Media, they tellin' lies about me, that don't matter much
I'm not turnin' up
I just got back from the future, don't know what I'm speakin' of
I'm not turnin' up
Leave you leakin' just for reachin', ain't no drinkin' out my cup
Shawty yellow, aw yeah, slim, she Barbie Doll bad
She got pregnant from my partner so I had to fall back
She was with another rapper, hold up, I can't talk that
Text her when she call back, if I ain't a dick slanger tell me what you call that

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us (What if God was one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Looking for love in the club like one of us (In the club)
Tryna make it out the slums like one of us (Slums like one of us, aw yeah)
What if God is one of us (What if God is one of us)
Just a thug like one of us (Just a thug like one of us)
Getting it out the mud like one of us (Out the mud)
Making calls to the plug like one of us

[Outro]
Out the mud
Making calls to the plug like one of us
Out the mud
Making calls to the plug like one of us
