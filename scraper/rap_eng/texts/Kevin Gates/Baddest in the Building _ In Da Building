[Intro : Kevin Gates]
Thatâ€™s it right there
Let me see something
Man you something serious ya heard me
Some might consider this a problem I easily fall in love
Excuse me if I touch, you the baddest in the club
I desire your body, exotic, I just can't get enough
You the baddest world

[Hook : Kevin Gates]
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like

[Verse 1 : Kevin Gates]
Do it in the mirror, make your body jerk
Pressure when we sex'n so it gotta hurt
Got your hand on my head while I'm chewin' on your kitty
I'm the cutest in the city in a collar shirt
Got a million dollar swag pants hang off my ass
And the money comin' fast, sell a lot of work
Few festivities we can peep this evening
Thinking we can both leave we don't need a reason
Got the window top flight out to Puerto Pico
Butt-naked in the tub with the ? steamer
Put the weed up when you see the people
90 day tech for a misdemeanor
My chick's demeanor, might get pissed at me
If she catch me sneakin' with another skeezer
Wild out in the club, real street niggas hold ya bottles up
Other niggas women tend to follow us
I'm in the V.I.P. section don't bother us
You know you couldn't see me with binoculars
Paparazzi think's I'm popular
Luca Brasi get's on top of her
Make her holla like an opera
All these lights in the house, all the candles in the bathroom
Step out of ya bath robes and welcome to my classroom
Bubble gum, bubble bath, pro position
The life jury cited on some ? postions
Spread your booty cheeks I'mma lick all in between
While I hit you from the back in the slow position
Get it from the side, get on top and let you ride
Then after that you can do that bad position

[Hook : Kevin Gates]
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like

[Verse 2 : Max Minelli]
I just spotted the baddest bitch in the building tonight
And I ain't leavin' 'less she leavin' with me
I overheard you told tell ya girl ya nigga wasn't fucking you right
I been drinking plus I done threw me back three
I'mma hit you with that ? I done came down
I ain't finna front you the flyest thing 'round
Head to the toes, shoes to the clothes
Ducks get played, bad bitches get choose
Bad bitches get they ears, neck, and wrist froze
Boss bitch swag, you be shittin' on them hoes
Love the way you pose when them niggas take flicks
Pull up to the club stuntin' hard in the six, six
Drop the top I pull out the knot
I make all them hoes bow down to you
Cause they ain't on ya level, I'mma change ya life
They ain't got no business hangin' 'round with you
I'm down to do anything you down to do
Go anywhere you down to go
You don't wanna make love I'mma beat it up
But when you 'bout to bust I'mma start grinding ?

[Hook : Kevin Gates]
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
You the baddest in the buildin'
My money super right
Got whatever parked outside
You could leave with me if you'd like
