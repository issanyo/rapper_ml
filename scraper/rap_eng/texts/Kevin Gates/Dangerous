[Intro]
Mute it I don't wanna hear myself
I don't wanna hear myself

[Verse 1]
Intricate lifestyles of the rich and famous
Considerably, I got this tendency for gripping bangers
Well dressed gentleman, but still a gangsta
I could make you moan spank ya and lick ya ankles
I'm saying tho
It be interesting when we kick it
This feeling no intermission
I'm feeling ya intuition
With hopes that I end up breaking you off
Take a load off
Take ya clothes off
Impatiently communicating daily but we don't talk
Gates make that pussy get wetter then rain weather
Body so soft I'm calling it Wayne leather
Passing through the hood with memories of the block
Left hand holding the wheel our fingers are interlocked
Tinted windows but the rocks still glistin' on the watch

[Hook]
My phone rings, who is this?
I don't know but I know you in my business
On the front of my boxers traces of ya lipstick
Shawty can we kick it tonight tonight
Say we never fall in love and never bring it up oh
Being lonely never really been a thing to us
Then you find another human like, never find a human like
Relationship strange to us
Guess it's safe to say we living dangerous, dangerous
Living danger ra oh oh, danger ra oh oh
Dangerous, dangerous
Living danger ra oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Complications in a lot of the stories you tell people
Street sweeper with a preaches commitment a bell ringer
Seen it all took a lost through the flossing it get exhausting
Death before dishonor you talk and you see the coffin
Grew up without a father rough, ain't nobody caution us
All in front my niece I got a bunch of fiends walking up
I'm a provider my actions go unacknowledged
Habits my satisfaction no longer promoting violence
I'm in the driver seat, Satan to the right of me
Pistol in the same city ain't nobody liking me
Agree to disagree in the differences in opinions
Hard living God willing my business is never finished
My life hard, niggas know I fight the same way
I don't like 'em, I alright it they pipe em the same day
Same gentleman was sticking his dick in ya dame face
All red on ya forehead right where ya brain lay
Artist painting depictions with a mill up on my mind
Exercise selling pies doing sit ups on my grind
Yo bitch up on my mind, it's interesting to hear
Nibbling on her ear while I ripped her from the rear
Paid rent in 2 apartments so constituents can live
Iron for the bullets, harassing on the avenue
All under my underarms fondling my valuables
Automatic Thompson, charming with a attitude
Death threats and apologies, only to get back at you
Local law enforcement itching to take a crack at you
Sent you up the river when they figure ain't no cracking you
Fuck about a pregnancy, fuck about ya life
What I hold blow ya shoulders off pump it out ya wife
Niggas send me letters can't forget to mail 'em back
What we don't have in common I done been to hell and back
The game a dead end don't forget to tell 'em that

[Hook]
My phone rings, who is this?
I don't know but I know you in my business
Call in inconsiderate, label me a misfit
You guilty 'til you innocent tonight, tonight
Say we never fall in love and never bring it up up
Being lonely never really been a thing to us
Then you find another human like, never find a human like
Relationship strange to us
Guess it's safe to say we living dangerous, dangerous
Living danger ra oh oh, danger ra oh oh
Dangerous, dangerous
Living danger ra oh oh, oh oh
