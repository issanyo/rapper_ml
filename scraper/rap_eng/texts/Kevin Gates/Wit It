[Intro]
Yeah that's gangsta shit right there
Look say bruh I ain't tripping bout that one ya heard me but look I'mma die hard behind this one here

[Hook]
I'm wit it I'm wit it I'm ready
Serious bout what you say now
Be ready for love
I'm wit it I'm wit it I'm ready
Serious bout what you say
Now ya ready for love
Hustle all day long but all I ever thought about was you
When it rains it pours
It's sad I'm told but all I saw was you
I'll fuck you right, I will
Unlike nobody else
Put that pussy on me make me want nobody else but you

[Verse]
Jumping, pussy gushing
Running like a water faucet
(Please) Don't get off it
I'm out my mind don't know what to call it
Hard to stand and too close to the edge
I think I'm falling
I'm wit it you wit it
Say that you willing we leap out the window
No filter no feelings no ceilings
On bail, like Master P no limit
Acceptance for Kevin's it's a process
You say that you love me no objects
Etc., etc., stop that
Been difficult for me to dodge it

[Hook]
I'm wit it I'm wit it I'm ready
Serious bout what you say now
Be ready for love
I'm wit it I'm wit it I'm ready
Serious bout what you say
Now ya ready for love
Hustle all day long
But all I ever thought about was you
When it rains it pours
It's sad I'm told but all I saw was you
I'll fuck you right, I will
Unlike nobody else
Put that pussy on me make me want nobody else but you

I'm wit it I'm wit it (Chained to you)
I'm wit it I'm wit it (Chained to you)
Hustle all day long but all I ever thought about was you
When it rains it pours
It's sad I'm told but all I saw was you

[Verse]
