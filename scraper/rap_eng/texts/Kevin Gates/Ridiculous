[Intro]
Yung Lan on the track
Hunnit bands for a kilo nigga

[Verse 1]
Shot the tech, she won't hit on the hip
Saks Fifth, ain't an act it's a gift
Puerto Rican, wishin' Johnny was here
Get to speakin', lotta diamonds in here
Maserati, I just did it for Mazi
Did time, wasn't really a problem
Watch flooded, bend a block in the bottom
Fours down, this a violent environment
North side, this a violent environment
Big Rod, gotta watch who around me
Free Nel pullin' up in an Audi
Free Ox pullin' up in an Audi
In the Feds, that's what they got in common
I'm yeah, gotta run up a comma
So focused, I ain't checkin' the comment
Want smoke? Go relocate your momma
Been broke, had to come up from grindin'
Sold soap, had to come up, no options
Jack the cell, had to come up from robbin'
Bad thang, had it to get it from round me
Tall nigga thought that he was my partner
Nuk switched on me, don't even holla
Gave these niggas everything I had in me
Nowadays, I wouldn't even give 'em a dollar
Diamond chains got a bigger bag wit' me
Nowadays I can send the piranhas
Made mistakes, better man and I'm honest
Never fold under pressure, I'm silent
Never told on a nigga, I promise
Lots of fights but I'm rollin' about it
Ask Guap how I go, no retirement
Ask Chicken, I'm controllin' the county

[Chorus]
Vacuum seal the money, ink, wrap it up, we 'bout to send it
When it come to catchin' plays, movin' major weight, I'm in the Guinness
Breadwinner, one nation under God, I represent it
Diamond teeth, I'ma gold-mouthed dog, bitch, I'm ridiculous
Vacuum seal the money, ink, wrap it up, we 'bout to send it
When it come to catchin' plays, movin' major weight, I'm in the Guinness
Breadwinner, one nation under God, I represent it
Diamond teeth, I'ma gold-mouthed dog, bitch, I'm ridiculous

[Verse 2]
Kinda cold in the whip, I'm adjustin' the climate
Break bread, give my hitters assignments
Pretty hair, kingpin in designer
Speakin' Spanish, plug live on a island
Big blunts, order kush and went drivin'
Car wash with a steering alignment
Shorty bad, puttin' dick in her body
No rubber, wasn't thinkin' about it
Swang the door, I was thinkin' about you
Told Juli, when he get out, I got him
Private jets with unlimited mileage
Daydreamin', wanna go back to college
Z06, I'ma put it in throttle
Four children, gotta look out for Tyler
Daughter Islah, got Kayson and Khaza
Side bitches tryna give me vagina
Neighborhood, I'm considered a timer
Reminiscin', I remember a time when I was little, wishin' I was a timer
Big rocks, I pull up and just blind ya
Big body, I'm considered a shiner
I'ma slang it, if I up, I'ma iron ya
Say you need it, I never deny you
Watch your people, them the ones who'll try ya
I'ma gangsta, I'm a nigga with honor
Need a brick? Throw you that on consignment
Need a whip? Take mine, you could drive it
Hit the bricks, I was movin' in silence
I'm him, if you hate to acknowledge
Moneybagg yo, I'm right onside him
Say they want that, they undecided
Out of line, I'ma catch me a body

[Chorus]
Vacuum seal the money, ink, wrap it up, we 'bout to send it
When it come to catchin' plays, movin' major weight, I'm in the Guinness
Breadwinner, one nation under God, I represent it
Diamond teeth, I'ma gold-mouthed dog, bitch, I'm ridiculous
Vacuum seal the money, ink, wrap it up, we 'bout to send it
When it come to catchin' plays, movin' major weight, I'm in the Guinness
Breadwinner, one nation under God, I represent it
Diamond teeth, I'ma gold-mouthed dog, bitch, I'm ridiculous
