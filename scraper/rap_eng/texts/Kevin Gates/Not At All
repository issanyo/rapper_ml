Time after time I done told myself
No matter what I ain't gon' cry at all
I can take a lot of pain It don't hurt at all
Time after time I done told myself
No matter what I ain't gon' cry at all
I can take a lot of pain It don't hurt at all
Best friends change up still standing tall
Bitch telling me "she love me" I heard it all
Lying to her like I never heard that before
Hold it down for my niggas that's behind the wall
Money on the phone, picking up when they call
I'd trade it all just to see you niggas ballin'
Going hard I ain't never going back to starving
God first, Get money the only thing we know

(Verse 1) (CG)
God first and that's where its at
CG I'm the bossman taking dabs and countin' cash
I bet you never thought I could floss like that
Put me on hold Imma call right back
Time is money I ain't waiting for that ass
Gimme something bad I can turn it into racks
Got a 1911 in my mothafuckin' hand
Never been a bitch no not at all
I know when I've won and I know when I've lost
Fuck with me yo I'll brush it off
I did my time and I don' paid the cost
Major chips yeah 24 a brick
Hit the block with the word and it went 86
Put it in the pot made a killin' with the shit
Never gon' stop till I make it big
Bring the pain make em' feel it quick
Respect the game and all those in it
I'm calling shots tryna lead the clique
Neglect the change and you'll find living
Ain't really what you thought it was
Getting money's the only thing we know
Pullin' up in that big body
Watch em' swingin' bang on 84s

(Verse 2) (CG)
A double cup of that activist
I can take the pain it don't hurt at all
Pullin' up with the baddest bitch
Making moves sittin' in my car
No limit on the credit cards
I can buy the bar like a birthday card
Hit the mall I got shoppin' bags
I love poppin' tags I like a girl that can play her part
Put it on me girl twerk it let me see what you working with
I gotta know if you really can drop it low down to the floor
Turn around and do a split
Can you tell I'm bout my bread I'm a baller mothafucka
Got years doing this shit
Don't think cause I'm nice that I won't think twice
Bout killing me a hatin' ass snitch
No not at all been ready since a mothafucka can recall
I hope you ready for some real shit from the boss
Kevin Gates got the hook and I got the bars
Till the end we all really got to work hard
Just know that I'm ready for a vacay
Hatin' on me make a move get the AK
Keep watchin' what I do you won't lose pay
Spit game recognize all day
