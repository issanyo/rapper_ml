[Intro]
You know when I made this on the [?]
The [?] you heard
I was [?] wit' this li' bitch ya heard me?
She took me to her daddy
I thought her daddy was the man
But her momma really was the one ya heard me?
I told that nigga, that nigga told me
"If you ever hurt my daughter I'll kill your family"
I told him "I ain't got no family!"

[Chorus]
Do you feel, this here
In your ear, dick up here
In your ribs, on the rear
From the rear, in the mirror
I'm him, don't trip
I gotchu, I gotchu
I got me, just get you
Selfish, it's not true
I'ma show you how I could do
Throw it back when you rock the move
Reason why I probably rock with you
I got me, I got you
On the rear, do you feel?
This here, in your ear
Dick up here, in your ribs
On the rear, from the rear

[Verse 1]
Dirty dollar getter
On the phone with one of my hittas
Drop the bands, pots and pans
In the kitchen, baggin up sand
I'm not carin', one of my mans
He owed me 100 bands
Say no names, hearing impaired
Push one button, your feet up in the air
Hard for me to sit back in this chair
I'm hands on, I'm everywhere
Go in his section turn up there
Cold sport but life ain't fair
Go back platinum one more time
After that it's white veneer
Say she love me, okay yeah
Let me rip and go somewhere
Step out dressed in sweatsuit dapper
They might say I'm debonair
In the slum, you never there
Paid for techs, you meant protection
Big old weapon by the stairs
From the projects, we in Paris
50 wrapped inside the fanny
Sipping fanta without a care

[Chorus]
Do you feel, this here
In your ear, dick up here
In your ribs, on the rear
From the rear, in the mirror
I'm him, don't trip
I gotchu, I gotchu
I got me, just get you
Selfish, it's not true
I'ma show you how I could do
Throw it back when you rock the move
Reason why I probably rock with you
I got me, I got you
On the rear, do you feel?
This here, in your ear
Dick up here, in your ribs
On the rear, from the rear

[Verse 2]
Screechin', mackin', bouncin'
Big ol' booty bouncin'
I'm pourin' up two ounces
This here flow like a fountain
This here tall like a mountain
We in here money countin'
Sometimes its so astoundin'
Blowing this loud we loungin'
Fix your face stop poutin
Bae I'ma take you shoppin'
I told you stop that doubtin'
GPS re-routin'
Goin' out for a lil' outin'
You better not get to shoutin'
I'll show you I'm really 'bout it
Don't make no scene in public
Bae who the fuck gettin' loud with?
Get in this room, get full of this liquor
Same one I dick you down in
Bricks just touched from out in the H
You knowin' I'm out of town and
Making that face I'm poundin'
You making that face you frownin' up

[Chorus]
Do you feel, this here
In your ear, dick up here
In your ribs, on the rear
From the rear, in the mirror
I'm him, don't trip
I gotchu, I gotchu
I got me, Just get you
Selfish, it's not true
I'ma show you how I could do
Throw it back when you rock the move
Reason why I probably rock with you
I got me, I got you
On the rear, do you feel?
This here, in your ear
Dick up here, in your ribs
On the rear, from the rear
