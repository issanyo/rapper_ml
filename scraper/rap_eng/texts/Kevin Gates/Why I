[Intro]
How do I look? I'm so nervous
Come on, we gon' be late!
This my first time ever doin' somethin' on this type of scale
Here goes nothin'
Ladies and gentlemen, people in the back, people in the front
Watch my shoes and try not to knock over my cup
And no you can't hit my blunt
Slim chick, fat chick, boy and that girl
Everybody out in the whole wide world
I wanna give y'all my brother, my dear brother, the honorable Kevin Gates

[Chorus]
Been abused, it gets hard to smile
Been betrayed once again, it happens all the time
Heart bigger than your body, love be hard to find
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I

[Verse 1]
Half of a blunt, puffin', strings on my heart tuggin'
You my best friend, smile callin' each other, we cousins
Problems played, you and me out there, shoulder play scufflin'
Other way, you and me 'bout that gunplay, bussin'
Don't give up on me, nigga, I won't give up on you
I don't need to be a hero, I thought I seen it all but I was lost
Nuk, you hurt me when you switched up, baby
You, me and Percy 'posed to get this paper, can't sit at my table

[Pre-Chorus]
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Oh, why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Oh why do you, why do you, why
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?

[Chorus]
Been abused, it gets hard to smile
Been betrayed once again, it happens all the time
Heart bigger than your body, love be hard to find
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I
Friendships got tainted, I remained amazin', I

[Verse 2]
I love my uncle, but he got somethin' against me, he trippin'
I'm just doin' what we said we was gon' do when we get it
Bread winner, other side tend to hate when you're winnin'
Slick remarks when we talk, I pretend I don't get it
Teeth knocked out whenever I had a scratch, Willie Denver
Small price that come with fightin' when you stand at attention
Then I big body Benzed it, comin' through with the juice
Talkin' bad behind my back, when I pull up, they salute
I say I big body Benzed it, comin' through with the juice
Talkin' bad behind my back, when I pull up they salute
You really hurt me when you switched up, baby
We were supposed to have the horses on the acre
Can't sit at my table
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Can't sit at my table
Can't sit at my table

[Outro]
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Oh, why do you say, "Fuck me"?
Why do you say, "Fuck me"?
