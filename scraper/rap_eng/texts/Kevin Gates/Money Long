[Intro]
DJ Chose
Dude was kinda speaking’ on you in a negative manner
Gettin’ out his body and then I got on top of that for you
Believe that, come here, bitch

[Chorus]
Money long (money), but my dick longer (it is)
Cellphone (yeah), won’t that pussy phone her (hello?)
Send her home (yeah), bitch, I’m in a loner (what happened?)
Money long (money), but my dick longer
Say your pack strong (pack strong), but my pack stronger
Mister bring it home (bring it home), double California
Don’t get your head blown (boom), drop a digit on ya
Say your money long (whew), but my dick longer

[Verse 1]
Let the dons step off planes, I go dumb, hold up, wait (let’s do it)
Breadwinner, I don’t wait, what you skrt, ain’t no brakes (skrt)
Black on black, matchin’ plates, back to hat, match the K (brrat)
Back to back, I’m on drank (I am), matter fact, that’s a shame (for real)
Gettin’ better, sippin’ lesser (I’m him), damn near had everything (let’s go)
Watch plain, rockin’ Jane (blow), get you changed for some change
I’m Gucci love, and I don’t change, when I get that through your brain
I’m shy, big body Range, I glide, we not the same
Tryna get back to that rico, but I had to fly to Spain
Hold up, let me take this call (do it), just got off the phone with Mane (god damn)
Ain’t your business, state the business, when can I get in your face (all year)
Breadwinner, how I came, I got weight on my name
And that’s on gang

[Chorus]
Money long (money), but my dick longer (it is)
Cellphone (yeah), won’t that pussy phone her (hello?)
Send her home (yeah), bitch, I’m in a loner (what happened?)
Money long (money), but my dick longer
Say your pack strong (pack strong), but my pack stronger
Mister bring it home (bring it home), double California
Don’t get your head blown (boom), drop a digit on ya
Say your money long (whew), but my dick longer

[Verse 2]
Thumbin’ through it, I’m with one of my killers, really think they belong in a kennel
I’ma die strong-armin’ the Civic (grr), sneak, geek, pour up in the sampler (yeah)
Fly to me, I be goin’ in slippers, I dive in your shit in a minute (come here, what’s up)
Sometimes, I get awkward intentions (I do), calm down, my reflection a killer (man)
That’s Kaza if you did not remember, I rock a t-shirt and a fitted (uh huh)
Snapback, put a hole in your center (bow bow), really that, I’m controllin’ the temperature (I am)
Yeen heard? I’m supplyin’ the weather (yew), out the country, like Miles, I’m extra (yew)
Hashish, hundred pounds or better, diss me, hit the town excessive (woo)
Two times, dick her down, I’m pressured (woo), like kids say, mines is better (it is)
I’m him, yeah, I be steppin’, flash out, sometimes I’m special (put it on sometimes)
Cigarette breath hoes, I never, you fall, please leave my presence (beat it, aye)
Bling blaow, my gold reflectin’, I smile, and that’s a blessing

[Chorus]
Money long (money), but my dick longer (it is)
Cellphone (yeah), won’t that pussy phone her (hello?)
Send her home (yeah), bitch, I’m in a loner (what happened?)
Money long (money), but my dick longer
Say your pack strong (pack strong), but my pack stronger
Mister bring it home (bring it home), double California
Don’t get your head blown (boom), drop a digit on ya
Say your money long (whew), but my dick longer
