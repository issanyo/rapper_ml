[Intro]
Ooh, man, that's pressure
Yeah, pressure
Havin' my way with the money, yeah
Nah, my muscles just gon' tighten up when they get a lil' cold

[Chorus]
Havin' my way with the money, yeah, that shit keep comin' and comin'
Been through the stack, I get rack on a rack, I keep thumbin' and thumbin'
I did a show, caught a case on that road, I ain't runnin' from nothin'
God on my side, I got nothin' to hide, now I'm runnin' from nothin'
God got me, woke me up, took me in
Sat me down, broke me down, said make me proud (said make me proud)
I came up, I rose up out the mud
Can't trust nobody so in God I trust

[Verse 1]
I'm a grinder, oh ooh oh oh oh
You got the number one song on the radio and you still gotta sit in jail?
I went and laid, I'm in the top rack by the lake
I'ma sleep all day and be up late
I had to make the best of what I had
I'm in the trap spot with the bangs
Fuckin' a bad bitch with the brain
Double the carats, get the rings
Standin' on all ten in the game
Just say went all in the paint
Happen to merc and I'm thinkin' 'bout Menace
Thinkin' 'bout Gunna, new daughter, delivered
Thinkin' 'bout havin' a car in the city
Under the tint, she be showin' her titties
There was a time when my name would get mentioned
Hard to stay fly when your pockets is empty
Bentley pull up, we gon' drop in there, simply
I'ma work out and go hard it's just in me
Cardiovascular, cardio fitness
Get outta pocket, we deal with it quickly
Lovin' a snake, turned around and it bit me right in the kidney

[Chorus]
Havin' my way with the money, yeah, that shit keep comin' and comin'
Ran through the stack, I get rack on a rack, I keep thumbin' and thumbin'
I did a show, caught a case on that road, I ain't runnin' from nothin'
God on my side, I got nothin' to hide, now I'm runnin' from nothin'
God got me, woke me up, took me in
Sat me down, broke me down, said make me proud
I came up, I rose up out the mud
Can't trust nobody so in God I trust

[Break]
Hey look, check it out
Hey, I'ma make mistakes in life
Yes sir
I'm not perfect, ya heard me? (I'm not perfect)
You know, don't judge me 'cause I don't judge

[Verse 2]
Ain't been to no funerals lately, my partners, they dead or in jail
I fought the pain for a long time, I tried alot and I failed
But now it's time to excel, they come on a metric ton scale
Say hold on to the guardrail, flyin' outta here
From takin' a trip to supply to takin' a trip to Dubai
I done been shitted on by a lotta rappers and it don't at all matter
The ones that fuck with me know I'm one-thousand, they know I'm all action
I'm a big general, I could send a load and I'm bread winner active
I could cook off the pot or a base, fishscale I could lock
Re-compress, five ton in a box
Guerilla hustle, I done been on the block

[Chorus]
Havin' my way with the money, yeah, that shit keep comin' and comin'
Ran through the stack, I get rack on a rack, I keep thumbin' and thumbin'
I did a show, caught a case on that road, I ain't runnin' from nothin'
God on my side, I got nothin' to hide, now I'm runnin' from nothin'
God got me, woke me up, took me in
Sat me down, broke me down, said make me proud
I came up, I rose up out the mud
Can't trust nobody so in God I trust
