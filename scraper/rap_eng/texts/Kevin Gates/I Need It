[Intro]
Turn it up, let me hear it
Turn it up, let me hear it, Oh dumb

[Hook]
I need it up in my life
Every night get on my knees and ask but
Heaven ain't been speaking back (speaking back)
I need it up in my life
This goes out to every ghetto every project who know losing's not an option
I need it up in my life (yeah)
All this money, cars, and clothes
You know I'm balling out control, on you hoes

[Verse 1]
They attempt to label me inhumane
I believe in God but not your God
Last nigga got outta pocket on the wrong decor got broke off
What the fuck is up with these A&Rs
Criticizing music they can't make
Poking fun at my struggle, I don't find shit funny
I live in places that ain't safe
2008 I got my leg blown off
Any given day could get my head blown off
Rest in peace to Tyree Edwards
Bullet in his head, got his head blown off
Tried school, was a great kid
Academically I excelled in it
Grew up poor, got teased a lot
Cause my school clothes had a smell in 'em
Same shirt four weeks straight
On the block grinding, caught sales in it
Juvenile detention my case worker said I might be headed for a crash course
No father figure, role models up in prison all my jump shots hit the back board
Head-on collision, not watching while I'm steering
No air bag, head hit the dash board

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Approaching me and wanna shoot the shit
But pretend as if they here to help Gates
Behind my back in front of label heads
Saying "Kevin just won't cooperate"
Missed flights, showing up late
I live life didn't rap about it
No time to live, my time for them
How the fuck I'm gon' rap about it
Speak the truth or rap around it
And in a wrap around I rapped about it
Tragic ending for some family members
In heaven sitting wishing I was with em
Instead I'm stuck in this hell on earth
With pretend friends who think of ways to get me
Couple niggas I loaned money
Said they got me ain't never get me
Tell a bitch no, I'm never guilty
Still ain't got no guilty feeling
Always telling me what I should do different
But can't explain why they ain't winning
My own blood, just turned against me
In disbelief I'm like "not true"
Devastated, got caught off guard
When I seen the switch I'm like "not you"

[Hook]
