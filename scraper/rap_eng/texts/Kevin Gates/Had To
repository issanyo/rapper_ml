[Intro]
Oooh, ooh, ooh
You had to, you had to know it
Oooh, you had to know it
What you doin'?
I'm a professional

[Chorus]
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
Too many snakes in my
Too much lean in my soda, you know I had to pour it
You know I had to pour it
Rubber bands in my hand, shawty bad, I had to throw it
Hunnit, hunnit
I be trickin' on a bag, yeah, yeah, you had to know it
Is you rollin'? Ooh, you had to know it (woo!)
I'm, I'm a soldier, ooh, you had to know it
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
'Bout to go get what I'm owed
Get throwed, you had to know it

[Verse 1]
I'm a professional, she fell in love in the bed
She let her heart get the best of her
Butter, she spread, dope what I do to her legs
Like the cocaine, I be stretchin' 'em
I've been hurtin', you wouldn't know the half
I'm a snake and she ain't mow the grass
Guard's down, now I'm on her ass
Credit card I'm maxin' out again
Drop top vert, do the dash
Breadwinner... in the Jag
My lil' brother, yeah she let him smash
Ain't too many we ain't really had
Stack it to the ceilin', do what you 'posed to do
Watch everybody that you keepin' close to you
Fuck over you bad and won't nobody notice
My heart kept the razor, ain't nothin' disposable
Gave it my all, went to war, I've been scarred
Dealt with a broad and she played with my heart
Played on by friends, not protectin' my cards
They would all say they was playin' their part
Came from the bottom, we aim for the stars
Won't shoot in the air, that's like playin' with God
Bitch, what up?

[Chorus]
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
Too many snakes in my
Too much lean in my soda, you know I had to pour it
You know I had to pour it
Rubber bands in my hand, shawty bad, I had to throw it
Hunnit, hunnit
I be trickin' on a bag, yeah, yeah, you had to know it
Is you rollin'? Ooh, you had to know it (woo!)
I'm, I'm a soldier, ooh, you had to know it
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
'Bout to go get what I'm owed
Get throwed, you had to know it

[Verse 2]
Climbin forward, strivin', I'm a grinder
Rearview watchin' what's behind you
Peripheral, watchin' what's on side you
Close homies just as a reminder
You can smoke, just don't let it blind you
These scriptures what I'm tellin Khaza
Don't let nobody know that you a monster
Keep it on the tuck and then surprise 'em
Mouth shut, let 'em think you're quiet
Big steps, always movin' silent
Strong shit, a legend when you sign it
Wishy washy shit you don't acknowledge
Pillow talk, pussy shit in private
Them hoes only know what you allow
Stand on all ten like you're a tower
One deep, you are not a coward
Never rat, if you do, you sour
Respect level, keep it at a dollar
Not involved in other people's problems
Everything you hear you think about
Don't make sense, nothin' wrong with doubtin'
Ease off, get it from around you
See trouble, try your best to dodge it
If it's meant for you, you die about it

[Chorus]
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
Too many snakes in my
Too much lean in my soda, you know I had to pour it
You know I had to pour it
Rubber bands in my hand, shawty bad, I had to throw it
Hunnit, hunnit
I be trickin' on a bag, yeah, yeah, you had to know it
Is you rollin'? Ooh, you had to know it (woo!)
I'm, I'm a soldier, ooh, you had to know it
Too many snakes in my grass, yeah, yeah, I had to mow it
'Bout to go get what I'm owed
Get throwed, you had to know it
