[Hook]
Can't explain it cause I know I'm not famous, but got everybody staring at me
I be pulling out cars cause my block roll hard
And the trap like a money machine
Had to make em believe
Make em believe
I could make em believe
Make em believe
I don't know no one like this, I'm so icy
I might not know how to behave, but bitch I know I got my money right

[Verse]
Stick up, lift your hands up
Love to show my ass Mr. Never Pick My Pants up
Big old watch and bracelet looking like a set of handcuffs
Bitch I'm dead game chain swang when I stand up
I'm from that South Side where shit ain't all gravy
Street nigga, I ain't tryna be no basketball player
My dog in the feds cause he clutch choppas
T address, gun cocker don da da
Game sharper than I thumbnail tack, and we still hold weight like a dumbbell rack
I know Rodrick Butler, the real Rodrick Butler
Yard full of pits aka big brother
Hold it down this for my lil rounds
Movie getting money
Hello World, I'm the man out here
My name rang every where I stand out here
My name rang every where I stand out here

[Hook]
Can't explain it cause I know I'm not famous, but got everybody staring at me
I be pulling out cars cause my block roll hard
And the trap like a money machine
Had to make em believe
Make em believe
I could make em believe
Make em believe
I don't know no one like this, I'm so icy
I might not know how to behave, but bitch I know I got my money right

[Verse]
Full time grind
Got some fly rides
Go to jail tryna shine I don't even drive mine
Interception, my pack got intercepted
My lil wide receiver seen him no pass cover protection
Curb where we see him, curb where we leave him
Backed down up under the words of his preacher
Holla'd bout you want me dead
The Glock goin go to clicking
Made a promise to my hood, won't let the block go unattended
Sendin pictures to the prison, God loves his children
Godmother still suffers with a  drug addiction
Bumpin trap or die, Gates like Jeezy
Straight drop no whip straight I ain't like Jeezy
16 2 and a quarters 8 4 and a half's equals 36 ounces, brick, you do the math
63 off a 2 then stuff em in a bag
The only thing you ever cut was another niggas hair

[Hook]
Can't explain it cause I know I'm not famous, but got everybody staring at me

And the trap like a money machine
Had to make em believe
Make em believe
I could make em believe
Make em believe
I don't know no one like this, I'm so icy
I might not know how to behave, but bitch I know I got my money right
