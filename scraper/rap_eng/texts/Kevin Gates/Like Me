[Intro]
Cash Money AP
I got shit
Leeboy on the track

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
Everything that you see me with be the finest
I can make you fall in love with all these diamonds
Got a few tricks thats up my sleeve, I can blow your mind with
I'm addicted to getting money, addicted to shining
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
You can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, young nigga shining

[Verse 1: NBA Youngboy]
I know I'm young but I feel like it's nothing I can't handle
Take all my problems and I drown 'em in this dirty Fanta
Baby you can tag along with me while I travel
Pop this X with me I swear we gon' be moving faster
Straight to the top I won't never let up
He dropped the ball and I'm gon' pick it up
Run that check till them niggas catch up
Gotta be strapped when I'm up in the club
For so many reasons they hating on us
But we get it anyways they ain't stopping nothing
I'm on I-10 to your state where I'm coming
Meet me at the hotel, I'ma leave in the morning
Had to get my foot up in the game
Fell off the ladder every time I climbed it
I threw 38 hundred on my chain
I go to Houston just to fuck with Johnny
Get that bag and take care of my gang
Since day 1 all my niggas been behind me
I'm in that North where you probably can find me
Up in the studio fuck where they hiding
Get money from doing these rap shows
I'ma ride this whip as far as I can go
Ma I swear I ain't selling that dope no more
No more of them nights with nowhere to go
For Lil Dave I gotta pour a 4
I swear that shit hurting a nigga's soul
Forever stand tall no I won't fold

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
Everything that you see me with be the finest
I can make you fall in love with all these diamonds
Got a few tricks thats up my sleeve, I can blow your mind with
I'm addicted to getting money, addicted to shining
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
You can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, young nigga shining

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Look in the mirror not seeing a thing
I might be the one not believing in me
Focused on grinding and staying humble
I wonder what everyone seeing in me
Remember when they didn't wanna believe, no, no, no
My diamonds is water and they tend to bling
I ain't finished, hold on
Drop top six, pull up in the Jag'
AMG 65 on they ass
Burning rubber, I've been thumbing through the bands
Pockets poking out, I can't pull up my pants
Thinking back to when we didn't have a plan
Air conditioner broke, we just had a fan
Shoes dirty, everybody used to laugh
Did the dash, acting bad? Yes I am
Chick who I was feeling wasn't in to talking
Ran the money up, then she started calling
Smokin' good- excuse me with the cough
Who is this so sorry? How you get my number?
I apologize, don't hate me
I've been whipping 'Raris out lately
One lifetime situation
Ain't nobody like me, I'm amazing

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
Everything that you see me with be the finest
I can make you fall in love with all these diamonds
Got a few tricks thats up my sleeve, I can blow your mind with
I'm addicted to getting money, addicted to shining
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
You can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, young nigga shining

[Verse 3: Stroke Tha Don]
It's Stroke Tha Don
You know I'm the shit nigga
Spent a cold 20 bands on my wrist nigga
Blow a bag, get it back, look like we flipped the kitchen
Nigga this close to a million making digits off of digits
I'm on the block with a sack of that Urkel
Young nigga trapping, I'm keeping it working
Front on (?) just to keep 'em in focus
I keep it G like a real nigga supposed to
Bitch I'm a boss, I ain't never no worker
Never stop grinding, we steady be working
Nothing but real niggas up in my circle

[Hook: NBA Youngboy]
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga like me
No you can't find a nigga like me, a nigga shining
