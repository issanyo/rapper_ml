[Intro: Kevin Gates]
Switch my swag, pants on sag, pockets full of bands
(Man hol' up)
Nah bitch don't go duck on me
I bet I'll make the trip
Switch my swag, pants on sag, pockets full of bands
(I'll never let you down)
You are what you do, not what you say you'll do

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
I'm a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot 'dem wonder how I do it
Switch my swag, pants on sag, pockets full of bands
Pockets full of bands

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it
Cocaine distribution
Bred to win, born a loser
Bad dope steady losing
Dog food with the music
Narcotic distribution
Drinking by the liter, diamonds in my ear
German engineered, I ain’t gotta steer
Gold framed specs, lens is super clear
Toast ‘em with the lean, this is our year
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates & AR-AB
Switch my swag, pants on sag, pockets full of bands
Dirty fingernails, what the fuck I’m doing?
Me and AR-AB, what the fuck we doing?
Dippin’ in a truck, pistol by the gut
Bend them niggas’ block, hit them niggas up
Call a phone cab, you ain’t gotta come
Got a hundred shooters, this ain’t what they want
Wanted eight grams, jumped to 33
This example saying call it Patrick Ewing
In my business ain’t no tellin’ what we doing
Lyor Cohen saying “How the hell he do it?"
Chop a hundred grams, never had a deal
No advance money, got it off the bill
Caught my first body high off the pill
Internet beef, how are y’all for real?
Jumping petty bonds, legend, I’m a god
Step a step for nothing, clutch a bunch of rods
I’m ready to die, faith is in the law
When gangster shit go on, I am unalarmed
Mice in the trap, counting thirty racks
Forty in my lap, how the fuck I rap?
Nigga I used to love lived next door
Shot me in my back as I was getting more

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it
Cocaine distribution
Bred to win, born a loser
Bad dope steady losing
Dog food with the music
Narcotic distribution
Drinking by the liter, diamonds in my ear
German engineered, I ain’t gotta steer
Gold framed specs, lens is super clear
Toast ‘em with the lean, this is our year
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it

[Verse 2: AR-AB &  Kevin Gates]
Coke wanna rob, uzi got mileage
Sitting in the projects, sleeping with a chopper
Bring it down proper, with a bunch of rastas
They cut your head off, then they play soccer
([?] wan and keep it wan?)
(Big man you sound like a pwussy wan)
Cash I’ll bring it, bet I get ‘em gone
Bet I make the trip, watch I get ‘em gone
Brick squares doing big numbers
Team will [?] Hitchcock
Dreamed of this shit sitting in the cell
Murder one charge, I ain’t have bail
First day home they gave me a MAC
125, point it to the scale
Used to be the plug, turned into the socket
In the Maserati, kicking it with Masi
Fast car driving, grape jar watching
Fiends, cops, crips, Xan bar popping
Hi-Tech straight, pour four zips
Fuck that Sprite, I don’t mix this
Pop me a perc, Full blown song
Pop me an opp, it been too long
Black selfish devil, black phone [?]
Credit card holder, fuck a damn wallet
Overcook dope, rubber band addict
Diamond teeth boy, landlord Brasi

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it
Cocaine distribution
Bred to win, born a loser
Bad dope steady losing
Dog food with the music
Narcotic distribution
Drinking by the liter, diamonds in my ear
German engineered, I ain’t gotta steer
Gold framed specs, lens is super clear
Toast ‘em with the lean, this is our year
I’m a shooter with a shooter
Extension out the baby uzi
A lot ‘dem wonder how I do it
