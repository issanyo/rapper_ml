All I wanted was a Bentley
A bad bitch and a necklace
40 on me never empty
Boss up, El Jefe
All I wanted was a Bentley
Bad bitch with a necklace
40 on me never empty
Boss up, El Jefe
All I wanted was a Bentley
Bad bitch with a necklace
40 on me never empty
Boss up, El Jefe

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Breadwinner Clarion, Nip Hussle marathon
Shooting dice, shotgun house with the cameras on
Bet a thousand dollars, 80 grand, get your gamble on
Me and Ron turned the trap house to the Paramount
Break it down, recompress, hit it with the hammer salt
Cocaine lock in the pot, tryna grab it off
On the pool table, loose paper, rubber band it up
In a fuck nigga’s chest, wait, still standing up
Bitch where you going with your face? dick standing up
Cocaine flakes, soft shake, Arm & Hammered up
Louis V monogram print, bandana-d up
Dog leash harness and the jeans, go’n add it up
Scheming on some boo schemes with your boo thing
Booty wing, pinky ring, on the bling, I ain’t had enough
Never had much, grind hard out of bad luck
Pussy nigga, probably feeling I ain’t did bad enough
Said he feel swaggered up, why you niggas mad at us?
Bitch ran off, so what, they don’t matter much
Steppin' out the James Bond coupe wit' the cannon tucked
AK47 go whoo, I blam it up
Hustle, got stamina, designer, examiner
Dolce & Gabbana, Odell, I’m an animal
Turned trash into cash
Went and bought a bitch a fake ass
Put her in the strip club and she ran it up

[Verse 2: Zuse]
Ride by, ooh, trigger finger pop
Catch an opp, stop, never watch him drop
Stone cold killer, cold 'cane dealer
AK clip, been that big gorilla
Never been to prison, caught never snitching
Came from the bottom, made it out the kitchen
Stovetop, baking soda, whole block
Pyrex, stove, pot
All I wanted was to make it for my mama
Breadwinner Boobie, all about the dollar
Millz with me, got the beat around his collar
Ron with me, got a problem, see the chopper
All I wanted was a bad bitch who swallow
All I wanted was to maintain
Bought an AP, it’s a plain jane
I’ma ride the track, no A train
Ruger in my Robin’s, Carlos in my Choo’s
Hugo when I’m robbing, Carlos when I shoot
Aim it at your head, knock you out your boots
Catch you by yourself, yaba-daba-doo
Yipee-ki-yay, [?]
Real nigga, I don’t do what rappers do
