Alright everybody work with me here, I REALLY tried my best. Like for effort

You gon' have to keep up with me on here
Handle the business, I'm all man
We had to drink from the storm drain
In front of the judge and the storm came
But i got it in like Lebron James
Don’t give a fuck about ball man
But we put a dent in yo bald fade
Dickin' the Denim the wrong play
I get the ?? in the hallway
Breakin' up bricks, yellin' fish
Hitta shit, money legit
Buy you a classic, Rockin a fit
Shit that I sip, More than your rent
I took a pledge when i came in the game
Gave the pussy nigga back his lil chain
Diamond link on the beat when it hang
My bitch bad with a booty that swing
Fake shit done polluted the game
Took a loss stayed true to the game
Big boss bought a coupe and a Range
Big dawg got a shooter who aim
Wrong move, it'll cost you your brain
Finessed moves he finessin my thing
Fucked over, I ain't sayin' I admit it
Came back then i ran up ticket
I’m him yeah the gangsta edition
Walked out really spankin' a nigga
Say they plannin on yankin' a nigga
On the Gram now I'm likin' they pictures
No plate, pulin' up in a rental
Hop out this a animal intro
Surgical what i am with a pistol
Swaying colors draw big ammunition
Neckway? an animal with it
Get away, gotta get to the 'Claren
Kill a junkie who was driving a witness
Burn the fingerprints after we finish
Tap in tell Gunna come get me
In Atlanta layin' low in the city
King branded let me suck on your titty
Wait i feel it and I'm rippin her kidney
Diamond teeth when I lick on her kitty
Only thing I ain’t doin’ no kissing
Been played I ain’t get in my feelings
Sad thing it was one of my niggas
Both ways I get money, a killa
No way i ain’t doin no stealing
Big gangs they really wanted them niggas
Been this loud, really one of them niggas
EMC super dope in the ceiling
Had to agree with controllin' the building
You get on that boat you know how we livin’
I’m pushing that button whoever won’t get it
Big bricks talking on the yard
Clientele up flooded all
Met a plug, then I met a plug
I'm the only drug dealer on the wall
Mutual gun,              -|
Shot up the Quan,     |
Baby who Don?         | <- I tried
From Mutual Quan   |
Didn't do it "??"         -|
I do my shit without a nigga knowing
Walk in the room get to glowing
Placed a order but you didn’t know it
Make ya baby lately shit went boring
Bred winner did it from the corner

( Chorus )
I get the picture, right now
Lil’ bitty bitch, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out
I get the picture, right now
Lil’ bitty bitch, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out
Stop playin’, why is you playin’
I am not playin’ I’m in the yeah
I’m just sayin’ what is you saying
I do not say, how much is yeah
Stop *pause* right now
Lil’ bitty bitchh, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out

( Verse 2 )
CO6
Chanel on the seat
Put em on feet?
Fuck up the street
Diamond my link, diamond my teeth
Now "??"
But me to speak
Yeah
Cocaine sexy motherfucker
Uptown flexin’ in the gutter
Was broke now I'm flexin’ for the summer
Back then ain’t nobody love me
Clinks? something stomping in the jungle
Let’s get ready for the rumble
We’ll skee- actually I don't stutter
Talk loud bet ya I won't mumble
Real fly jacket how I'm comin
Freshest in the district but I’m humble
Dealing with addiction I'm a junkie
Losing weight running to the money
Having plenty paper been acustomed
Leavin' out the tailor get it custom
Pray my baby make it in through Customs
Fucked her sent her right back to her country
Puerto rican jawn you know I love you
My ?exchange informer? kinda cut me
Pourin' drinks still likin' money
Freaky bitch still like em slutty
Kitchen phone ring
Breakin' down a whole thing
Two-fifty-two in every pie
Down a piece a whole thing
Mix a H with quanna??
Take him 1-2 whole days
Molly grits supply the strip
Byy the triple private planes
Read a book and took a nap
And doing the things that power the brain
Haters hate that's on the daily
Expected that when power came
Overseas the hours changed
Spent the week and counting change
Regular shit ima go in a minute
Pull a Gerar? and open the fender
Won't talk to a hoe throw the rope in the ??
Get out her pockets you go on restriction
All of my comments I pay no attention
Militant man with a militant interest
Muslim, seeking a need of ??
Stay on your Deen, he know that we mention
Try to come pay me I'm dodging a visit
He know it's illegal to charge over interest
Food for the homeless who sleeping on benches
You play with my sister you know that it's tension
Carpet to carpet the way I be nailing shit
Carpet them bitches they waiting to billy
Plumber went pipin' inside ??
The biscuit and put one them many extensions
Sauce on the table the waiter come get it
My come in throwin? flavor I'm drippin
Thumbin' through paper I'm not ??
You prolly won't see unless you comin' with it
He my lieutenant he drivin a bentley
It's something exclusive then it's not a semi
The window not tinted
I want you to see all the jewelry I got all my shit goin digi
I'ma unblock everybody on insta
I'm livin' like that, I know you get the picture

( Chorus )
I get the picture, right now
Lil’ bitty bitch, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out
I get the picture, right now
Lil’ bitty bitch, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out
Stop playin’, why is you playin’
I am not playin’ I’m in the yeah
I’m just sayin’ what is you saying
I do not say, how much is yeah
Stop *pause* right now
Lil’ bitty bitchh, bite down
One on my wrists, iced out
Real ones don’t hit with the lights out
( Stop Playin! )
