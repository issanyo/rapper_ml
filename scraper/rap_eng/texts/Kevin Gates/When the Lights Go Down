[Hook]
When the lights go down
All alone and there's no one to trust but now
Cause you connect with the heavens above
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love (to love)
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love
Are you looking for someone to love

[Verse]
Pornographic material picture picture perfect
Candlelit with frankincense, lyrics written in cursive
As I confess to the stars, with no facade, no disregard for sober thoughts
Screaming "Free Lee Lucas, and rest in peace to Wig"
May the angels congregate in the protection of his kids
Full armor underarmor with no protection for my ribs
Have yet to say "What gives?", as I would never give up
Who ever would've thought that those lames would try to kill us?
We supposed to be family, to the standards they ain't live up
Checking the car for bombs at gas stations where I fill up
Fell a thousand times, God grant me the strength to get up
Bread Winners Association, mission is to bill up
La'Corey my li'l brother, he constantly wylin out
Say the knowledge I provide him should probably calm him down
He say nigga killed his dad and being chill won't bring him back
So whoever disrespect'll feel this pistol in they flap
In a moving car, looking at the moon through Dior frames
A lot of fallen stars, I'm a start, meteors rain
Christian Dior, Louboutin, who are those names
An open court, but of course not a sports game
Court cases lawyer pays him for continuation
Thought you had a made case
Especially when you know you paid him
Date re-dated, old lady, kids with broken faces
Court motion waved it entered a sentence plea
Down on bending knees "god please lean your sentencing"
No cooperation, metal bracelets, never squeal or scream
I did my time, but in the mirror I can live with me
Imitation: Not who they proclaiming or appear to be
Life in the fast lane turned into a crash course
JanSport greyhound travel without a passport
Bag sorts in the brown relationship bulimic
Need to put you straight to sleep and I ain't talking anesthesia

[Hook]
When the lights go down
All alone and there's no one to trust but now
Cause you connect with the heavens above
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love
Are you looking for someone to love

[Verse 2]
Music career that I pursue perhaps minus my goal intact
Private council a monster contract but you were holding that
Loose in a loophole same hoe that tried to hold him back
Proportion catapult him might propel him through the roof
If you could see the way I'm flossing
Think I need a wider shoe
Situation sticky wish I would have tried a pot of glue
If you believe in magic I believe in Harry Potter too
Back when Tyler was a toddler watching Harry Potter 2
Hated on by my team made em believe (believe that)
Parking lot, no parking spot, no targets out (you don't see that?)
Jumping back in his range rover
I'm approaching my mark
I've enclosed in my art all the emotional parts
Constant encroachment on my lil soldiers commotion will start
Pick twelve whoever said bowling or stroll in the park
Werewolves coming out at night get it on in the dark
Cancel constantly spark chemo shark get it gone with a dart
Fat people shit no control it just go when I fart
Ever tried hibachi teriyaki don't go with a fork
In our stomach mamma bugging like I never was in
Must have been flown with a stark
Accident prone but I'm sharp
Lump back come home but he short
Underprivileged living in the winter wore nothing but shorts
Plus I got a cousin who get off he go dumb but he short
Ooh my bitch booty super juicy go dumb in them shorts
Fresh off the launching pad searching me for contraband
Boobie black tooly strapped where my entourage will stand
Limo tinted windows on my cars knowing all's well
Marvel at my Marvel Collection this a garage sale
Ain't hard to sell
Hard times catching hard cells
South side Baton Rouge City Where The Lord Dwells
More sell as Kevin Gates leader of the cartel
See me sipping lean by the liter till my heart fails
Never frail

When the lights go down
All alone and there's no one to trust but now
Cause you connect with the heavens above
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love
Are you looking for someone to love you now
Say are you looking for someone to love
Are you looking for someone to love you
