[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Wherever I go man I keep the trap jumping
Just the other day man I spent about a hundred
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
I ain't never going broke long my trap stay jumping
I ain't running out of work cause my plug keep it coming
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
Ima keep getting money ima keep getting money
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Got no respect I sell work on a sunday
I dont speak english all I talk is money
Hit em with the Glock might hit em with the semi
Nigga sneak dissing see ya tell them niggas miss ya
Fuck yo bitch on a Wednesday B I bet ya bitch missing
Poured a, eight of that lean man Im higher than a frizzy
Nigga got killed and it wasn't no witness
Gripping on this semi tell em peoples come and get me

[Hook]
Wherever I go man I keep the trap jumping
Just the other day man I spent about a hundred
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
I ain't never going broke long my trap stay jumping
I ain't running out of work cause my plug keep it coming
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
Ima keep getting money ima keep getting money
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
(I Don't Get Tired)


[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I ain't worried bout yall Ima keep getting hunnids
Plug keep getting fronted through the bands still thumbing
Big clip keep clutching
Sipping on purp and then skertch in a vertical
Bullets be flipping I put em in vertical
Revving the engine but move like a turtle
Seem like you mad cause them bitches ain't heard of you
Step on my sneakers I might end up hurting you
Glistens on glisten this not a Bentley
Behind a tint of a brand new infinity
Spin in the secret compartment
I'm whipping equipment that came with a shift in it
First Patrick Ewings they right on the floor by the door but a nigga ain't kicking it

[Hook]
Wherever I go man I keep the trap jumping
Just the other day man I spent about a hundred
I ain't worried bout yall ima keep getting money
I ain't never going broke long my trap stay jumping
I ain't running out of work cause my plug keep it coming
I ain't worried bout ya'll I'ma keep getting money
Ima keep getting money Ima keep getting money
I ain't worried bout yall I'ma keep getting money


[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Get you whacked for a stack that's a cheap lil affair
I got shooters over here I got shooters over there
Don't make me find out where you live them shooters come in there
Got your BM in the trap she say y'all losers over there
I put that cooler on my mac just to get rid of a lil air
Shoot my tire getting hit get in here nobody standing here
Front street, we killing victims and witness
Trap king, introduce you to my kitchen

[hook]
Wherever I go man I keep the trap jumping
Just the other day man I spent about a hundred
I ain't worried bout yall Ima keep getting money
I ain't never going broke long my trap stay jumping
I ain't running out of work cause my plug keep it coming
I ain't worried bout yall Ima keep getting money
Ima keep getting money Ima keep getting money
I ain't worried bout yall I'ma keep getting money
