[Verse 1]
Text you
Really didn't mean to affect you
Take a look at your thighs
By the look in your eyes
You really need somebody to caress you
Undress you
Pull your hair
And put dick on your spine
Get loud in public if I catch you with some other guy
Do you feel loved whenever we're alone
Whenever we're alone I can make you feel loved
When I turn you around
And I grip your waist
While I hit you from behind
And no you can't be Mrs. gates
I do this every time
(I do this every time)

[Verse 2]
Hey, how you doing?
Look my name "Kevin Gates"
I know each and every way to make you feel good
Pants below my waist
Teardrops in my face
I'm intelligent as hell and I'm real hood
Slang dick
Real jugg especially next to me
She the type of woman that will kick it for a day
But if she can't have her way
Get upset and leave
Again and again
No option but the wind
Call one of your friends
They could fetch your things in here
