[Hook: Kevin Gates (2 Chainz)]
Whip through the dash (Whip through the dash)
Some thing on my wrist is blinging (blinging)
Got a bad bitch in my ride (my ride)
But the whole time I'm still thinking
(Bet I'm on it (on it)
Bet I'm on it (on it)
This ain't no motherfucking lease, I bet I own it) (cause i)
Smoking green and I'm leaning out the ladle
I'm the flyest nigga living in the whip while I'm still thinking
(Bet I'm on it (on it)
Bet I'm on it (on it)
This ain't no motherfucking lease, I bet I own it)

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Respect none of your lies
Got a tampon on my line
PH levels on offset but pussy hater good try
Double sip, double cup, double parked it this time
Double taking, taking place on a double date, she got ass shots
Bartender she can have shots, take her home give her back shots
Hustle really hard never made it with a sport
Five hundred four grams and you never woulda thought
Eighteen ounces made it with a fork
Loved in the hood but I'm hated in the court
When the ball hit the rim that's a miss
Come to think about it wait, that's a brick
Three hundred eight balls coming, no assist
Aw here we go again, mind on dope again
Cuffs on my wrist tell the deets I don't know again
Insecure guy probly mad bout his ho again
Foreign on them inches take your bitch cause she was taking interest
Ladle licker naval kisser rear and rip her from the rear

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I ain't with all the arcades
Dogged her out like a shar-pay
Fucked your girl for an appetizer then fucked again for an entree
Southside where I came from, murder rate on the rise
Niggas will murk for food they might as well hold up a sign
I get minez, spell it with a "z"
Niggas sleeping on me: z, z, z
I wake them niggas up, take them niggas' cut, ate them niggas' lunch, EBT
See my movements is a movie, good head soothes me
And I love group sex, hell yea I'ma groupie
If sex is a weapon (weapon), hit her ass with that Uzi
Told her to wipe me down, hit her ass with that Boosie
Then we got trippy (trippy), hit her ass with that Juicy ( Juicy)
Had sex with her raw, hit her ass with that sushi (sushi)
