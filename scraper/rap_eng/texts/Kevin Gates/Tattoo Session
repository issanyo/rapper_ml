[Verse]
My nigga got a pint now I'm pulling up on the west end
Face card digital, challenger with that FN
Situation critical calibers got the step in
They get out of jail, no answers, you getting left in
I just pull up outside in a foreign in this bitch
I ain't got on no designer, women swarming in this bitch
My eyes are squeezed like I'm foreign in this bitch
IDGT ain't no snoring in this bitch (go)
Breadwinner team (go) breadwinner team (go)
Breadwinner team, no surrender, no retreat
Breadwinner team (go) breadwinner team (go)
Breadwinner team, no surrender, no retreat
Now watch the way how i dance while i thumb through to bands
Selling rocks in my trap got bookoo racks in my pants
In the bottom (hol' up) what up mane shout out to Lil Vance
On the phone with Jason keep it gangster know how we be playing
If you like em you can fuck em too, you know he don't be caring
I used to fuck with shorty tough i gave her to my daddy
Kept it real when we was coming up you need something get at me
I broke up with her for Nikka i pull up on Oleander
B-Bitch Im turning up in foreign caught a jug in alabama
Pena telling me she pregnant for some nigga Out in plaquemine
I got family across the water, we all the way retarded
We got acres we got horses, what i meant to say was rarri's
And i you wanna fly to the other side of the country
Getting brain on a private jet when I'm steady running to the money
Thuggin out my mind all i see is dollar signs
And everybody watching when the whips pass by
Now watch the watch i dance while i thumb through the bands
Selling rocks in my trap got bookoo racks in my pants
I got family across the water, we all the way retarded
We got acres we got horses, what i meant to say was rarri's
It ain't shit to get a hoe, I got mac dre flo
Why you fuckin with a square I'm a certified player
When I rock Louis Vuitton people stop and stare
Fell in Neiman Marcus had this Gucci love affair
When I talk, my diamonds glare, I got every pair
If its something new by Gucci I'm completely un aware
Hold up, thats my dawg, had to show him bean ball
Had to fold him beefin with the home team
Watch I act like I don't know em
Panoramic roof inside the coupe, I could look up and talk to god
Getting brains looking at the stars, I say thank you lord
It's on everything, it's like a dealership in my garage
Step inside the car and we take off and go to Mars
Smoking satellites, loaded with them bars
Prison like fillin' prescriptions, i go hard behind the bars
Pack got a runner running back
Macaroni throwing it in the hamper
College life star running back
Step team swaggin on the campus
I'm a fly nigga button down
Collared shirts and designer fabrics
Fuck it baby maybe I ain't flashy
Bus it baby steady be harassing
Slap her ass who the fuck you sassin
Tell her friends girl you fuckin nasty
Cut her with the pistol and assassin
Jumping out the window with the ratchet
Soccer player kicking it with Samson
She the truth making it a example
Won't forget I done been embarrassed
Dub show I done been to dallas
In attendance and something that was average
Baby daddy playing for the mavericks
People saying Kevin stop the madness
I don't know couple stubborn habits
Money lover jumping acrobatics
Band camp swimming with lil daddy
Meant to say diving in the shit
Interstate flying with a brick
Gliding with the iron in the clip
Face card behind me concealed
Send it back wrapped Saran
Vacuum seal trailer with the wheel
Hate the way I'm playing in the field
Taylor made standing foreal
Dress code orange all in one
All white coming with the stripes
Novel reading skimming through the pages
Modulating contemplating things
Uh uh bae you complicating things
Know he jealous in his heart he timid
Tell a pussy nigga mind his business
Start a fight he wouldn't start a engine
Sleep him he could argue with the fishes
No retreat and never no surrender
Excellent whatever you can mention
Beautiful creative ingenuity
Barnes and nobel show full with extensions
Women with it got to pay attention
(i don't know what I'm doing)
Now they lovin' lovin  your position
Push button switch in the ignition
Love my self, people say I'm picky
Other partner don't believe in tricking
Down south nigga thinking different
One of mine nigga imma get it
Breadwinner stick it to the mission
One god this is my religion
(i don't know what the fuck the world
Coming too. Gates got every nigga in the game talking about they eat booty
You know, eating booty and (what other shit that nigga do?) sag
His pants and cell phones, and getting money and all the lil bitch ass shit
Man that ain't no real nigga shit that nigga be doing man that nigga bitch man
I wouldn't tell him that to his face, but he is a bitch. yeah that the last
Straight up. you know imma say it behind his back, when he come I ain't gonna say nothing
But when he leave its fuck him again, and you know how that go, you know
