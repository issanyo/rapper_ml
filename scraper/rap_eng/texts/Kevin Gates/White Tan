[Verse 1-Kevin Gates]
Stupid Step-Father, I'm wonderin' is you stupid?
Facial expression vacant, get puzzled as if a doofus
Bad news truly, nose up her ass often
Socially a misfit, my dick you should get off it
4 63's, clickin' 9s, droppin' dimes off it
Bottom line a revolver, problem of mine solver
Dodgin' a crime, while in the blind of a flyin' saucer
Unidentified object, and dead of the night walkin'
Dawg barkin I'm sparkin, hard to talk from a coffin
When Tharson go to war couldn't call it off if I called him
Needle into my skin no pretendin' be somewhat therapeutic
While in my lair in the air performin' aerial movement
Thoughts linger, distinctively as if parachuting
Whisper police and be quickly seen by a pair of shooters
Stare or prove it, arousin' theories that I'm hard to kill
Oxygen the toxin' while watchin' shawty contortion' it

[Hook-Kevin Gates]
I could dap you with the right hand
And then bat you with the left hand
A lot of niggas pussy they been comin' at me left hand
On the stove over the pot
I'm droppin' soda with the right hand
Butterknife and scrape the Pyrex cookin'
White tan, oh ohhh ohh
White tan, oh oh
Yo oh oh
White tan oh oh

[Interlude-Kevin Gates]
Shit, I got to feelin' myself
I forgot where I come in
Hold on
Hold up
Let me see

[Verse 2-Kevin Gates]
It go bloom bloom blocka, salute troops proper
Pigs inquisitive ya listenin' better not be Sinatra
Ya better resemble Gotti
Embodyin' Luca Brasi
In the lobby with the try-me
Ya women wish they could try it out
Creep into the Cliqo, not humble who gon' stick by me now?
While he down, devisin' a plot, wish they could tie me down?
I be round, Mafia Mechanisms and all sorts
All ports, circlin' the globe thuggin' the raw sport
Raw Report Magazine reader, pull up in raw form
All corn, state of athleticism in y'all dorm
What I meant by sippin' drank the color we all knowin'
With that shit the same color as a airport

[Hook-Kevin Gates]
I could dap you with the right hand
And then bat you with the left hand
A lot of niggas pussy they been comin' at me left hand
On the stove over the pot
I'm droppin' soda with the right hand
Butterknife and scrape the Pyrex cookin'
White tan, oh ohhh ohh
White tan, oh oh
Yo oh oh
White tan oh oh
