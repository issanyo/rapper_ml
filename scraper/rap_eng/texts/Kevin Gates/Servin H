[Intro: Kevin Gates]
It's done
Yung Lan on the track
Diamonds on glisten, I shine for the summer
(It’s done)
Gold in my grill like I'm Breadwinner Gunna
(It's done)
You know, I be tryna find what make me happy but
(It’s done)
I don't really know what make me happy right now
(It's done, it's done, it's done)

[Verse 1]
Diamonds on glisten, I shine for the summer
Redo her frontal, her body I punish
Walk in the street like I'm Gotti, I'm thuggin'
He speakin’ on gangsta, he’s gotta be buggin'
She work at V Live, I supply her with lumber
The skirt that I choose, when supplying the jungle
Kevin Garnett, they retire my number
Got gold in my grill like I’m Breadwinner Gunna
Demand in my hand and I'm pushin' the button
Big body Benz, I'ma whip like a cutlass
Mouth full of diamonds, up under the gutter
Ain’t talkin' no scissors, we workin' with cutters
Balla and Solo retarded I'm muggin'
I punctured your hoe, put that rod on her cousin
Fresh out of jail made a brick, go to bumpin'
My children gon' eat you ain't telling me nothin'

[Chorus]
Trap in the trenches, I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Servin' them birds but it used to be bags
Flippin' them tickets, it use to be stacks
Watches don't tick, but it use to do that
One altercation, we swervin' wit' gats
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your head
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair

[Post-Chorus]
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair

[Verse 2]
Screech off in a foreign, this here get alarmin'
New firearm in the arm of my garments
Phone steady jumping my flip get annoying
Droppin' the pot  but my wrist not performin'
Ice on my necklace, my pendant performin'
This here cost a fortune, don't know if you knowin'
No one alive, no one alive can do your body like I do
Leather Chanel like we sponsored by Spalding
New rival location, immediate ballin'
Pack get the mail outta Cali, she caught it
Jump in the Toyota, my truck a Sequoia
I'm ridin' no more, takin' extra precaution
Get that out the way then get right back to flossin'
I did the dash in the "pewm" and you fell in love
My nickname should be "awesome"

[Chorus]
Trap in the trenches, I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Servin' them birds but it used to be bags
Flippin' them tickets, it use to be stacks
Watches don't tick, but it use to do that
One altercation, we swervin' wit' gats
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your head
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair

[Post-Chorus]
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair

[Verse 3]
Stuck up and cocky, can't help but to stare
She do what I tell her, my word in her hair
Penetrating her brain, it's disturbing her scalp
You look back at me when that ass in the air
Wigglin' slow when you dancin', it's sexy
She say she don't like when I fuck her aggressive
Comfort me, helpin' me hold it together
Get it in a rut when I deal with depression
Trump in the nat when I got in my bag
Ended the month with 48 grand
Order red wine and put that on my tab
Hoe reached for her phone and I got on her ass
I love my new hoe, I'ma take her to France
Hit Amsterdam and go hard on the gas
Booty so big difficult not to grab
Still tryna see how it got in them pants

[Chorus]
Trap in the trenches, I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Servin' them birds but it used to be bags
Flippin' them tickets, it use to be stacks
Watches don't tick, but it use to do that
One altercation, we swervin' wit' gats
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your head
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair

[Post-Chorus]
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair
Trap in the trenches I'm selling Hermes
H in syringes with zombies, ooh yeah
Hop out where you at, put a curve in your cap
Your bitch do what I tell her, my word in her hair
