[Intro: D.G.]
Yo
Young Chris what’s happening naggers
SE ? you already know how we rocking nigga

[Chorus: D.G.]
I grind I grind I grind all day
This paper what I’m trying to chase
All I want is money
I can see the shit from miles away
I’m in my lane get out my way
Grinding each and every day
I gotta run a check up
Imma keep on grinding till I’m straight
I grind I grind I grind all day
This paper what I’m trying to chase
All I want is money
I can see the shit from miles away
I’m in my lane get out my way
Grinding each and every day
I gotta run a check up
Imma keep on grinding till I’m straight

[Verse 1: D.G.]
Imma grind out till I feel I’m straight
Cause I don’t know no other way
Stacking up my dinner plate
Fuck niggas get out my way
Swagger turned up to the max
Pockets filled up with the rack
And I keep the scrap
For all you lame niggas who trying to check
Money all I wanna see
In and out these fucking streets
Money out the rats ass
But I call it Chucky Cheese
I seen the shit from miles away
Balling like the NBA
I just twist the game up
And threw it in the ashtray
I just kicked a field goal
Chris, we bout that cash flow
Getting money is all I know
And that’s just how the game go
Hustle hard just for that cake
Feel like Chris Rock I’m here to stay
Yea - feel like Chris Rock I’m here to stay

[Chorus: D.G.]
I grind I grind I grind all day
This paper what I’m trying to chase
All I want is money
I can see the shit from miles away
I’m in my lane get out my way
Grinding each and every day
I gotta run a check up
Imma keep on grinding till I’m straight

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Grinding hard - couldn’t get to sleep
Not counting sheep - but I’m having dreams
Powder whippin running out of chicken
With a lot of whips while I’m counting figures
This the game no counterfeitin'
In the paint don’t count for slipping
Pounds a midget if you down to get it
We could meet in ? while I pound a pigeon
Bell on a scale - dropped bread over there
People at the hotel - swing round to get it
Make sure the suite came equip with kitchens
Bout yo business we could test the issues
Pay my lil' sister Kayla - she’ll catch the dishes
When the flipping I’m over
Back to the crib with a fridge full of soda
Wrist in the clench I could win me some over
Fucking up the room smell the stench from the odor
Making another two hundred bands then it’s over
Chick around the corner
Fin to bend over
Poke her slow and stroke her
Last ? with game I’m in her brain
And me nuh roped her
Knuckles to the pavement
Grind for paper - you so loco

[Chorus: D.G.]
I grind I grind I grind all day
This paper what I’m trying to chase
All I want is money
I can see the shit from miles away
I’m in my lane get out my way
Grinding each and every day
I gotta run a check up
Imma keep on grinding till I’m straight
