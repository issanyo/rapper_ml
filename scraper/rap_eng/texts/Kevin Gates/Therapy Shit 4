[Verse 1]
Ay, ay, you ain't gotta love me, baby, I tell hoes
Go to trip and Imma buy me some Chanel, ho
Them Imma rock this shit in front ya on a cellphone
Hit the ground, go to flexin' from a cellphone
Independent big girl and she got her own apartment
Every night she set the mood and she don't like to argue
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
I do it, I stick it
I stick it, I do it
Suppressor, I'm pressure, but this is, a Uzi
I fuck with, lil Britney, and shoutout, lil Scooby
It's up there, I'm ignant, stop talking, let's do it
Word around town, I'm with another nigga bitch
Gotta be Alam busy dealin' with my kids
You love your ho then cuff her, fuck what other niggas
Her bootyhole retarded, pussy good, her mouth the same
She know that we beefin' and she started running games
She know we ain't speaking, can't get caught up in her ways
Watch her from behind, gotta holla and that's on gains
Slap her nine times, roll around, whatchu thank!
Free my nigga Malucci!
White toe, headband, let's do it
Before they started twerking
They used to pop the coochie
Before you started rapping, you weren't gangsta, you was pussy
You know you scared uhh, hold up there goes OG Boobie
I'm runnin the bread up, I got Huli right here coolin'
Controlling me, yeah love, I got shooters who got shooters
Exposing a real nigga, that's some shit that we not doing
We hide the floss by Brooklyn
Go ask Rylo how we movin
Oh she can't drop me off, I just jump out and go stupid
Wrong way to dumb way

We got some children, they gon' be strapped
Said you want kill me, nigga what's happening
I got Erkule goggles on
I've been flexing on my phone
Hold up nigga, watch yo tone
Big poem from the shoulder
Big bone with some chrome
Dude thought he was in power, got removed from his throne
Bitch I'm pressure on my end
I'm pressure on my end
I'm pressure on my end
I'm pressure on my end
Bitch I'm pressure on my end
I'm pressure on my end
Bitch I'm pressure on my end

I forgot what I was saying, retarded
When I walk in the room
You can't tell I'm ready to diamond
What's happening with you
Rocking a shirt with a collar, I got it, we up
I feel like you wasted my time and we up
Jump in your shit got a problem what's up
You think I don't got it, I'm bout it, what's up
You know that I'm rockin, you know I don't bluff
Walk in your thot, and I'll stab in your guts
I do not care about bunny cut up
Meant to say public, it must be the crush

[Spoken]
Anybody that knows me, if you've ever been around me
Or ever had the opportunity to be blessed to be in my presence
I'm upright, independent and fearless at all times
I don't engage in no bullshit
I mean, unless, it's with my lil team
You know, other than that, you know
All relationships are circumstantial to me
I'm pressure

[Verse 2]
Jump in the dashboard
I'm thuggin, I'm playin rover
I still was sufferin internally, whenever you came over
You told me whatever decision I make that we would remain closer
But you kinda changed over
Just try to remain sober
Kick dirt on my name, I maintain, then I stay focused
They get on Instagram and take shots at me, thinking I ain't noticed
I got a thing on top my neck, it got a brain on it
I got a thing inside my chest, it got some stains on it
I hit the shower, go workout and I don't think on it
You draw your sword get met with force, you can bank on it
I'm uptown in a Porsche, got my name on it
On south 12th, but of course, got my name on it
On Carolina and on Alyss, got my name on it
Go ask Lil Derrick, on St Joseph, got my name on it
Pressure on my end, now it's time to wild out
We don't do no drive-bys, we spin through then we hop out
Jump straight out, then run them bitches, all-
