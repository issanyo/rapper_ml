[Hook: Alley Boy]
Getting money right now
Nigga I ain't got no patience
I'm fucking on the first night
Cause I ain't got no patience
I done run through a whole honda
I ain't got no patience
Speeding out through a red light
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience
I ain't got no patience

[Verse 1: Alley Boy]
Running down to the [?]
No I ain't got no patience
Fuck around and you play with me
I'm busting with no patience
These niggas they patient
Fuck around and get sprayed quick
Watch you niggas do like a say full operation
Young nigga I'm amazing, Edgewood I was raised in
Murder charge when I was 19, 100 years I was facing
Still ain't got no patience fuck them niggas I'm blazing
When the jury say innocent I dare them niggas to take it
Niggas all over the internet they dissing like they waiting
I'm busting out a Bentley, no getting away from this cake nigga
I'll sell ya 25, she said "I ain't never sucked dick"
I can tell you're lying, she ready to fuck my whole clique

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
In my panamera roughing and I'm screeching out
We going deep be hanging the 40 heater out
Shawty all over instagram she say how much she dream about
I know some killers but on twitter they don't speak about it
Just spilt my lean whipped up in a civic
Going 100 in the game and I love my winners
I am not pretending I got two convictions
If a nigga wanna get it then it's up to my killa
My niggas I'm flippin, I'm flippin, I'm flippin
And if the trap house with it throw bricks to my nigga
My shit like ex I'ma pull up this syrup with the pump
When you finish if you hit me on the [?] yea
Holy shit I'm from the bando killa
Now I'm going killa with a killa in a rental
126, 4 and 1/2, 2 to a 9 and I don't remix them
Real rock on the spoon and it ain't know whippin
Real trap talk if you ever did straight drop
Out the pot overcooked don't bake out the corner of my eye
Gotta look both ways
