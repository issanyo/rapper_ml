[Intro: Kevin Gates]
You know what it is
You know how we hittin'
Just know that we alright
Just know that we alright

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tatted your name, now I don't know who you is
If I had to I would do it again
My partner died but on my arm he still lives
I wear my heart on my skin, can't forget where I been
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
On my back and all
You see how far I come
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
I'm out here going hard
My nigga fuck with y'all

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
What we doin’, pay attention
Whenever you talk to me, I would always listen
Never nothing wrong, it was always beneficial
Entertainment realm get so superficial
I was built for that pressure, I forgive you
All praise be to god, I’m official
In the game going hard, I been misused
Fucked up in the brain, got some issues
Ice box where my heart used to be
Eskimo city, no feelings, I'ma igloo
Know I’m way farther
Than you thought I would be
Ball 'til we fall, one call come and get you
Got the bread dropped off when the rent due
Hope you got that new car, that I sent you
If you didn’t baby please forgive me
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck if you don’t

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tatted your name, now I do know who you is
If I had to I would do it again
My partner died but on my arm he still lives
I wear my heart on my skin, can't forget where I been
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
On my back and all
You see how far I come
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
I'm out here going hard
My nigga fuck with y'all

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Handle business how I handle business
Violate, you gotta get the business
I went to Lee, I had a different vision
Bad bitches wasn’t tryna listen
I was fucking on coaching, off concord in an apartment
And rebels tryna get my caught in
Lil Easy talkin' we're in the park lane
Phil never jacked me, what you talkin’ 'bout
Bought a two and a quarter, in the middle of  drought
And lost fourteen grams and he swap me out
Ain’t nothing else to really talk about
I’m the one you get the green from
I used to front it when you need somethin’
I move bail, fat lips and leeches
Used to come and get the lean from
I remember when being a stand-up guy
Used to mean somethin’ [it really did]
Now it means nothing [at all]

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Tatted your name, now I do know who you is
If I had to I would do it again
My partner died but on my arm he still lives
I wear my heart on my skin, can't forget where I been
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
On my back and all
You see how far I come
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
I'm out here going hard
My nigga fuck with y'all
