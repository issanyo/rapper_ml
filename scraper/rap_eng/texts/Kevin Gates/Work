[Verse 1: Lua'proc]
Why you all in my pockets?
Bitch I copped the coupe and I dropped it
Got that suede roof and that carpet
Got that dual exhaust

Rocket up the boulevard on them thirties
Got them [pavs?] on me I'm dirty
Got that trunk filled I'm loaded
Got that [skunk in the head I load it]

Bricks in the red got bricks right here
Hundred thousand big flips right here
Me and Gates got whips right here
Nigga look you don't see that there?

Iced out bitch you see me clear
Wrist lit can you see my ear
Two flips my bezel price
Pushing work gotta keep my right

Fendi belt let my floss my wealth
Fendi shoes I been that dude
"That ballin' ho he so damn rude"
I'm still that nigga my pockets bigger

Got major figures ghillie nigga
Swisher Sweets or Phillys nigga
Transparent not transformer
Benz change like a Transformer

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
A nice and tall cook and
The heroin in the kitchen
Recompressing the coke
With the vinegar make it stiffen

Strenth in both wristses
Hundreds in both fistses
Sneezed on niggas
Feature price is ridiculous

Heatin on niggas
Slingin' dick to they bitches
Professional ass slanger
The biscuits stay stay in the britches

The number that you're hollerin'
Is pussy â€” so you pussy
Carbon fifteen reversible
Stock a fully

Diamonds in my teeth
I talk niggas be lookin
Club with a line
Suburban around the corner

Income tax time
Check cash and asking for office
Fiends out of Rehab
Relapsing after that [order?]
