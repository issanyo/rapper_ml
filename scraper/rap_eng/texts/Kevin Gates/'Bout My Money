[Hook: Malika]
You see me grinding, see me hustling, see me shining because it ain't no question that I'm about my money
All about my money, yeah
You see me doing my thing
All about the hunits, yeah
All about the money, yeah

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I keep cash for the re-up fast
Victim of the inner city with the beat up past
Lot of lean can't seem to get my feet up past
The half mark, get spark, clean up trash
I'm out the gun
Throw nothing for to eat
Muscle be the muscle when I stuff it in your cheek
When I'm clutching, probably touch you from your stomach to your sneaks
Bought her for the customer my hustle on a leash
Huffin' when I'm runnin' feel I'm subject to increase
But that something could get ugly if it's subject to the plead
Money in the street, sucking on my teeth like
Family members been mad
Been past three strikes

Hard to sleep right
All I do is sleep right
Somebody say the cost of success come with a cheap price (x2)

[Hook: Malika]
You see me grinding, see me hustling, see me shining because it ain't no question that I'm about my money
All about my money, yeah
You see me doing my thing
All about the hunits, yeah
All about the money, yeah

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I sell drugs, I ain't lying her, she get boring
And this fortune could possibly be my misfortune
I got portraits of my niggas never coming home
Tell them I miss them, send them pictures
Never coming home
Them people shackle me I never see my bitch again
No more trips out to Florida and Michigan
Got me wishing I could never touch a brick again
There go Coledo mi amigo got them bricks again
? they just ship them in
I tell them si senor
He say don't mention it
My brother telling me "Gates you need to slow it down"
This how I go, I'm about my money
Ain't no slowing down
Them people rolling around heard they winning tank shit
Special response team look like they in a tank, shit
See the city hurting, niggas tryna spank shit
I just be staying out the way, I don't think shit

[Hook: Malika]
You see me grinding, see me hustling, see me shining because it ain't no question that I'm about my money
All about my money, yeah
You see me doing my thing
All about the hunits, yeah
All about the money, yeah
