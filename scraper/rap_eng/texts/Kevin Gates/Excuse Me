[Intro]
I be hopin' sometimes for a moment to feel the light shine
If life is a gamble I'm willin' to bet my last dime
I know what it is to be victim of this bed I made so I lay
Bought this bread I don't play
Goin' through hell tryna make it
Not even heaven could stand in my way

[Hook]
Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
See I pay my dues, you can't afford it
Since I got them racks they can't ignore me
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me

[Verse 1]
Flaws on the table, I don't feel insecure
(I say why bout that boy, are you still insecure?)
Likkle wastegyal want fi man out di slum
(Batty fine, dutty wine me a want see it done)
Me and Millz break the nine, come on boost it up a notch
Demeanour of a leader, even cooler than your socks
I would say the watch but the bitch that cold
Waitin' to exhale, but she wouldn't let go
Leanin' out the liter, I ain't gettin' strep throat
Flyer than the seagulls steady bumpin' Beanie Sigel
Disrespect it then we squeezin', I ain't gettin' stepped on
Khaza, he the sequel, if you didn't catch on
Ain't no latchin' on to my success
Breadwinners association, I move for the paper the haters consider a threat
Condo screenshotting my convo, I meant to say text
Disruptive behavior, subject to change by my chain, get upset
I'm becomin' a gangster, they have PMS
If you won't be a woman then go get a plumber and grow you some breasts
Rollin' up sleeves like a sink, spread the cabinet, layin' pipe underneath
Rap game kitchen counter, came to tighten up leaks
(Tell 'em what you mean)
Time to tighten up the leash

[Hook]
Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
See I pay my dues, you can't afford it
Since I got them racks they can't ignore me
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, I'm a God
Neighborhood, I'm a star
Sick of red bitches, they don't listen in the car
Girlfriend in my lap while I'm twistin' the cigar
Luca Brasi, I murder bout Mazi
Mucho the boss still livin' in my thoughts
I'm a real vic, money limp when I walk
Beat a bitch back in, big dick dinner soft
Big clip by the couch wearin' zips that's an out
Public housing, no authority and the clique got a house
Try to turn speaker off blip-blip with the AUX
Tuck somethin' close to you, eatin' grits witcha spouse
No bathrobe wearin' ass nigga
Breadwinner brick game hashtag emblem
Peace sign on the hood in Benz symbol
Still goin' off, make the clique get richer
Shots on her back and her chest to the pillow
Pieces come together, playin' chest with a picture
Dog just a pawn, I be fresh, get the picture?
Knuckles all scarred up, discoloration
Mental gymnastics with this conversation
Just my little friend, this was just a vacation
I'm dedicated to the grind, real nigga discipline
Show on the road, low pros and they Michelin

[Hook]
Niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
See I pay my dues, you can't afford it
Since I got them racks they can't ignore me
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, it's a real nigga here with some money
Excuse me, niggas talkin' and that shit annoying
I keep it movin', fuck what's not important
Excuse me

[Outro]
Not even heaven could stand in my way
Not even heaven could stand in my way
Not even heaven could stand in my way
Not even heaven could stand in my way
