[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
Guess what I did (Ayy)
Broke down a bale of the brick (Ayy)
My jeweler just flooded my wrist, yeah

When they go front me some twens
As I buy my mama a new crib (Ayy)
Then buy my lil' bitch some new heels, yeah

Come with me, follow the drip (Drip)
You don't want no problem for real (Real)
Lay back, just popped me a seal (Yeah)

All I know how to do is get bands
Top down on a man, that's not my steelo (My steelo)
Stubble tip piece up in my pants

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Say Yella, you know I'm fuckin' with you
I- I- I took a bitch out of town, put some dick on her body
She text it, she thinkin' about me
She gave me a shower and baby you know what I'm 'bout, huh?
Started young, I'm tryin' to run them dollars up
Ain't acknowledge us, steady pilin' up
Got 'em frownin' up, it's really all or none
I'm in my bag, jump out the whip and I got on they ass
Trump Towers, I'm in here rockin' some ice (Bling)
While I'm talkin' my mouth go to glistening under the light
Grindin' hard, come up from under that life
Grindin' hard, baby I wanna shine
Ladies still ringin' my cellular
Shit in my lungs ain't no regular
Brushed aluminum texture whip up in the Vette an'
Hop out in your section and then go to flex on 'em
I'm talkin' 'bout extra, forgive me, I'm messin'
These niggas be hatin', I gotta address it
They women look sexy, they love how I'm dressed an'
And my diamonds reflectin' without no protection
I'm drinkin' consecutive, I'm an executive
Rollie a president

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
Guess what I did (Ayy)
Bust down a bale and a brick (Ayy)
My jeweler just flooded my wrist, yeah
('Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah)
When they go front me some twens
Had to buy my mama a new crib (Ayy)
Then buy my lil' bitch some new heels, yeah
('Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah, ayy)
Guess what I did (Ayy)
Guess what I did (Ayy)
Guess what I did (Ayy)
(Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah, ayy)
Guess what I did (Guess what I did)
Guess what I did (Know what I did)
Guess what I did
(Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah, ayy)

[Verse 3: Yella Beezy]
Follow me, ain't no choice (Ayy)
Just pulled off in a Porsche (Ayy)
Bitch give head like a dork (Ayy)
That nigga done with, hit him with a fork (Ayy)
Bitch I'm too high like a torch (Ayy)
I was young when I hopped off the porch (Ayy)
Bitch I'm fly than a cork
Got about twenty bands bound up in my shorts (Ayy)
Hey, I had to get big (Big)
Kickin' flame in this drip (Drip)
No we don't talk to the pigs (Yeah)
(Lemme tell you what I did, yeah)
Pull up with steel (Steel)
We gon' foll' there with my heel (Heel)
Your bitch had gnawed on my dick
(Lemme tell you what I did, yeah)
Man down (Man down), man down (Man down)
When I get on this sherm, oh you won't pounce
Grab a ounce (Grab a ounce), break it down (Break it down)
We'll cover ground and get 'em out
Wanna fuck with me? Oh really now? (Oh really now?)
Is you a boss bitch? Are you really down? (Really down?)
Lately I been comin' 'round with a bigger mouth (Bigger mouth)
You don't need no shovel how to dig me now

[Chorus: Yella Beezy]
Guess what I did (Ayy)
But I ain't buildin' no bridge (Ayy)
My jeweler just flooded my wrist, yeah
('Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah)
When they go front me some twens
As I buy my mama a new crib (Ayy)
Then buy my lil' bitch some new heels, yeah
('Tryin' to tell you what I did, yeah, ayy)
