[Young Roddy: Verse 1]
Uh, I'm stacking this bread to leave it for my junior
I told her give me head in the Uber
Wrist on freeze don't blame me blame my jeweler
I bring her to the projects, some shit she ain't used to
A hood nigga fa sho that's to the fullest
Ay tell them lame ass niggas to eat a bullet
Playin' hooky I was tryna get her cookies
I told her wear her hair so I could pull it
My money too tall to overlook me
Like John Salley, I'm coaching like Pat Riley
I used to hot box the whip leave it cloudy
I get some brains from a bitch then I'm outtie
My homie 'bout to catch a body I can't talk him out it
Feeling like I'm an outcast, Andre 3000
I'm tryna get that Bentley with no co-signer
A trap God I'm no role model

[Chorus: Young Roddy]
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga

[Verse 2: Trademark da Skydiver]
Live from the city where niggas get wet up
Your own homeboys will pull a set up if they jealous
Hard head youngins nigga ain't nothing you could tell us
Maneuver with entrepreneurs pursuers of the cheddar
I'm cool with the goons, Goodfellas and the sellers
Hackers, jackers, college kids and the felons
We all like minded we got that getting money fetish
So don't fuck around with the fuck around and feel shots from this Beretta
We don't play around we'll lay it down
Who shot ya, they ain't telling
Live by the code of the streets, never move without my heat
Stay on my shit cause if I slip I'm falling somewhere six feet deep
Got to reach my peak before I meet eternal sleep
And uh, niggas is weak they be praying for my downfall
Hate to see me up, want me in the dirt just like a groundhog
But, I'm back active, racks stacking, still snapping
Taking shots like it's March Madness with no practice

[Chorus: Young Roddy]
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga

[Verse 3: Cozz]
Uh, yeah
Oh my I'm so cold, I keep a Colt, no .45
Before I decided to get cosigned with J. Cole
I was the one behind these bars and still did no time
I still got no time for motherfucking starving artists
Wasn't hungry when a nigga tryna get a bargain
I ain't asked for shit, but dog I beg your pardon
I gave up a whole lot of shit back when I was starving
Just in case you was wondering where my leg and arm went
I gave it up a long time ago when niggas was starving
I studied, read up on it, and then I got involved with
A couple  big names, y'all niggas is some big lames
Nigga can't get tamed, a lion in the cage
These niggas, lying in they face
I mean they, tryna get paid
I mean they, tryna get fame but look you gotta get the dollars first
Then you get respect, sorry nigga that's just how it works
I'm saying, but I don't fuck around with that fuck around

[Chorus: Young Roddy]
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga

[Verse 4: Kevin Gates]
Father walked out of my life me and my momma had no Christmas
Remarried left me with Grandma now I got 2 younger siblings
My step father act as if he ain't even want me to visit
In the ghetto looking up to older niggas out here gettin' it
First chance buy half a gram for 20 cents we call 'em flippers
Broke it down with a safety pin, fast forward, juvy detention
Got right back at it charges back to back in prison
My street daddy believe in me, he said I got potential
Name ringing round my section got smokers coming to get it
Trap booming off the hinges now my friends ain't being friendly
Gangster nigga, old bitch been on my dick now niggas envy
Upgraded from riding rentals, tryna jack you gotta kill me

[Chorus: Young Roddy]
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga
And I don't fuck around with no fuck arounds so don't fuck around with my camp nigga
Never gave a fuck still don't give a fuck so don't fuck around and get capped nigga
