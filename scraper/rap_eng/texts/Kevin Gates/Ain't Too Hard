[Intro]
These tats on my face don't mean nothin'
I was locked up, that don't mean nothin'
When you make it through the struggle it tend to mean hustle
The only one in my life to come to mean something

[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
What you say you don't do girl, you know I will
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
Still surprised you haven't noticed it yet
The realest you ever met

[Verse 1]
I hustle on back page, now I got her face down
Frownin' why she take it, she don't like to make sounds
Bought a one way ticket, put her on the Greyhound
Workin' our hotels right before they played out
What's the problem? Why you not smilin'? We in the prime of our life
Supposed to be havin' the time of our life
Excuse the misunderstandin', sometimes you be so demandin'
Don't like to be told what to do, difficult but we manage
Said some things I didn't mean, caused emotional damage
I love the streets, I'm a gangster, I like to be in them daily
Your mother love me like a son but I'm not seein' me changin'
A lot of built up frustration due to past situations

[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
What you say you don't do girl, you know I will
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
Still surprised you haven't noticed it yet
The realest you ever met

[Verse 2]
Turned a hooker to a housewife and people say "how?"
Million dollar vision, you just gotta stay down
Take your pride out of the situation
Don't get all in your feelin's they gon' throw your weight around
Ah shit
She gon' kill herself if I leave but she know I don't play around
I got one text in this evenin', say she just made it in town
Wonderin' if I could see her, got some things to figure out
I ain't mean it, I was bluffin', thinkin' please don't leave me now
Boys II Men, I'm down on bended knees listenin' to The Weeknd
Now friends hate me sayin' "girl look when did he get out?"
My mother left when I was young
I'm commitment shy so when feelin's get involved I tend to run
Sometimes emotions get the best of me clearly
And I ain't never tried to straddle no fences
Been back and forth for a minute
And I know I seem reluctant
I've been hurt and you the only one that mean somethin'

[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
What you say you don't do girl, you know I will
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
Still surprised you haven't noticed it yet
The realest you ever met
