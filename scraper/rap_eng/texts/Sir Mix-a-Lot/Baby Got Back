I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face you get sprung

Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin’
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin’

Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take yo’ picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes m-m-me so horny

Ooh, Rumpo Smoothskin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie

I've seen her dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's sweat, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette

I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back

So, fellas!
Fellas!
Has your girlfriend got the butt?
Tell 'em to shake it!
Shake it!
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

I like 'em round and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal

I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh!
I ain't talkin' ‘bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys

I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-A-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble

So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo

A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna
Til’ the break of dawn!
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on

So, ladies!
Ladies!
If you wanna roll my Mercedes
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

Baby got back!
Yeah baby
When it comes to females
Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection

36-24-36? Ha ha
Only if she's 5'3"

So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that "hard" role
And tell you that the butt ain’t gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well, I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' ‘bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a Triple-X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-ALOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back

Little in the middle but she got much back
