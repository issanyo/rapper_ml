Three credit cards fulla fat (fat) clout
Fatass garage holdin nine (nine) cars
One of them Mack Daddy rap (rap) stars
Me, rollin in the AMG still
Six litre with the monochrome grille
Don't serve birds but I'm livin like a king
But the IRS got a thing for a brother like me
Uncle Sam wanna buy another missile (yep)
Strip Mix-a-Lot straight down to the gristle (mm)
I made a few mil' and the auditors come
Sounds dumb, but this is how Capone got hung (yep)
Somebody hated that Mix-a-Lot rep
Straight-up snitch tryin to get Mix sw-ept
But I'm back, the black dynamo's on track
I got jacked for the big tax
Yep, they freeze my accounts, put a lean on my house (mmm)
Straight left a nigga AAAAAASSED OUT
Helicopters over my house (my house)
Takin pictures of a brother in his draws wit his thing out (uhh)
Livin the life of a suspected crook
Cause I never play the game by the book
If you're livin too large, ya better watch that ass
Cause the IRS

This is bigger than One-Time, so I got mad
So what do ya got to say about me
The M-I-X-A-L-O, T?
He starts scopin my house, havin his doubts
About a brother with street AND bank clout
His partner was writin on a thick (thick) pad
Checkin out the goodies that Mix (Mix) had
Trippin off the things that I bought (bought) cash
Tryin to send a brother up-state (state) fast
Yep (yep), livin on the edge, I swear

Audited my books, now who's the real crooks?
On the streets, now I'm gettin funny looks ('sup fool?)

And that was just the ninety-one fees (god damn)

And now I'm trippin off a uncle named Sam
But a mack just can't go bank (bank) rupt
Still paid well cause I make (make) cuts
Accountants on the regular, checkin my ends
Bought another fresh drop top (top) Benz
Yep yep yep, +Just Da Pimpin in Me+
Twenty G's on the block when I hit L.B
Stashed a lil' bread in the ninety-three
Bill collectors don't see me, G!
In this sport, I'm the man with the miracle torque
To pull through all sorts of them tax audits
In '94, I know I gotta think fast
Cause they'll be back, tryin to take my stash
