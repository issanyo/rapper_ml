[Girls voice]
"Man I wish I could find me a brother with some game"

To the rescue!

Here's a little somethin' for you whacked out suckers
Rollin' twenty-third, sellin' dope to cluckers
Your bank is thick, but you got no game
Spittin' at freaks runnin' superfly slang
I'm comin' up the ave' hard as hell
In a droptop 'Vette with a greenwood tail
Girls are jockin', lookin' for a knockin'
Smart investments, keep me clockin'
You know a 'Vette only got two seats
Just enough room for a player and a freak
Rollin' in the park, 'n I seen this cutey
L.A. face, with the Oakland booty
She's on tip, but I'm playin' that role
Talkin' to the home boys, showin' my gold
Skeez on bell, Levi's swell
I'm spittin' that game, and I'm spittin' it well
Rolled up, pulled up on the girly
"Girl you wanna ride in my 'Vette?"
"Why surely!"
That's right baby, blowin' me a kiss
Thinkin' Mixalot gonna make you rich
Highside, highside, vapors that's right
Can't get play cause my games so tight
Now she's wit' it, skirts in effect
Layin' on the back-a my 'vette
I got game, I got game, You know I got game, I got game

POP THAT GAME

Bye-bye baby, Mix gotta roll
Switch to the Benz and I gotta get mo'
Hit the strip, seen this skinny
Butt shook like a 426 Hemi
Not just butt, baby hadda motor
Stacked to the max, hair to the shoulders
She's older but I can mold 'er
Dropped that game and it hit like boulders
Now she's sprung, sittin' in my Benz
Rollin' up the tint so you can't see in
Playin' this tape of old Luther stuff
"You wanna get with me, this ain't wild enough"
That's a cue, sorry Luther
Brother you can sing, but I just can't use ya
Thought she was cool, but the girl likes beat
Freak freak freak freak, baby wanna freak
Def 'n dope, "You slangin'" Nope
Callin' me a dealer cause I sport fat rope
Kept poppin' that game, knowin' I can get it
"Take me to the lake Mix, so we can get wit' it"
Oh no, time for the ramble, bring a jimmy hat
Cause I hate to gamble
Huffed 'n puffed 'n I just got in
Messin' up the backa my Benz
I got game girl - I got game

Two down, two to go
Can't live my night right if I don't knock four
I'm in a big 500SEL
Interior hot, with a perfume smell
Took it on home, hit the shower
'Bout to get busy in one more hour
Ducks look, but they never will find me
Hopped in my number two Benz 190
Here a skirt, there a skirt
Everywhere a skirt, skirt
Gotta have game, if you wanna get work
"Ah, you ain't nothin'"
Some suckers wanna crush me
Smooth, wit' a move, baby girl. Rush me
Here it is, from the wizard of hip-hop
A lesson in game, make the girls get hot
Picked up a girl named Mattie
Caught static from the sucker in a seven-two caddy
Mattie was hot, but her name was "not"
I ain't worried 'bout that, I ain't tyin' no knot
Took her to the hotel, game went strong
She thought I spent bank, but I really spent coupons
But it's cool, cause my rhyme went smooth
Savin' my money, cause my mouth is a tool
Rolled up close, when I hit the spit
I ain't worried 'bout my breath, cause I brush my teeth
Popped that game, freak got weak
Hit that jackpot, swept them feet
Mattie got busy with the bedroom eyes
Layin' on the big king-sized
I got game - I got game, girl - I got game - I got game

Yeah that's right home cut, I got G A M E, snatchin' up girlies
An' rollin' up suckers, know whatta I mean

Through with Mattie that makes three
"I'm gonna miss you babe, you gonna miss me?"
Got loose cause the girl hadda big caboose
Hadda break down cause the girl had juice
"I'm gonna miss you baby"
Smooth ain't it? Girls so sprung that she almost fainted
Headin' for the crib, tired brother
Thinking I was through when I spotted me another
Baby looks good so you know what the means
Drive around the block with the gangsta lean
Open that sun roof, crank that beat
Bumpin' up the avenue, impressin' them freaks
What's up baby, rump so big? The girl's on tip like funk on pigs
Runnin that game, cause I wanna get work
Sit don't rip rap home girl shirt
Here she comes, hopped in my car
Somethin' 'bout my Benzo's star and bars
Spit, spit, runnin' that game
I'm feelin' confident about another thick dame
All of a sudden, my game got crushed
Some sucker pulled up and his ride was plush
Rolled up smooth, the girls was waitin'
5.0, 24K Daytons
Oh-oh, think quick cause my girls jumpin' on home boy's tip
Better change my game, try another lure
Cause home boy's lookin' like Al B. Sure
But it's cool, cause I whipped out bank
Big dead presidents made her think
Back in effect, situation in hand
I'm the brother that the others can't stand
An' I got game, I got game, you know I got game
