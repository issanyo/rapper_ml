Mack Daddy
Ain't you tired of that gameless mark smackin' you in your face baby?
Mack Daddy
You better roll with the big mack, the man with the game
Mack Daddy
Gotta big snake, all you gotta do is make it dance, you know what I'm sayin'
Mack Daddy

[Verse 1]
I'm rollin' to another neighborhood
Me 'n my boyz, up to no good
Chasin' miniskirts 'n the ride is packed
Rollin' to a mall called SeaTac
Cruisin' 'n the cops don't like that
'Round the mall once 'n don't come back
Four-door Rolls with the black exterior
Turbo Bentley, white interior
A Rolls Royce fulla big black men
In the suburbs, messin' with citizens
Walkin' in the mall, looka how I spit
Sloppy dressed brothers make the females blitz
Big long starters, black low tops
Mack daddy hat got me lookin' like Pops
But that's cool, cuz, I'm mackin' anyway
'N your females my prey
'N I'm callin' out skirts like Chuck D
Sista we missed ya, get wit' me
Comin', runnin, your boyfriends gunnin'
The big boss is so cunnin'
Some of my home boys hate me
They get a microphone, then try to take me
But you ain't slip, sayin' what's up Mix?
Boy I'm hip to your tricks

[Hook]
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yeah ain't no reason to bet ya
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy
Steadily mackin'
Mack Daddy

[Verse 2:]
Kickin' in a buffed up Lamborghini
If your females proper she gots to see me
Cause I'm the king of the roll outs
Mack Daddy is back still runnin' my mouth
I see a freak on the SeaTac strip
My Lamborghini's brakes get grip
So I pull up on to The Spot
I start frontin', cause I wanna get jocked
Topped off the gas, whipped out my cash
'N one girls starts to laugh
But I'm still smooth
'N my game is on, so I make my move
Say, you in the white pants
I'm a step close to ya, but I won't dance
'N what you laughin' at
All the girls start pointin' at my hat
'N I'm a giggle wit' 'em, cause I just wanna get wit' 'em
I don't hit 'em, I just wanna stick 'em
So I pull baby girl to the side
She said she likes my car
I said take a ride
So we flipped up the doors on the Contach
But gettin' in a Lamborghini is hard
So I grabbed baby girl by the rear end
I thought she might need help gettin' in
So I clos' the do'
'N now you kno'
Mack Daddy is about to sco'
The girl said, baby you can have me
So I stopped at the tail
Cause I'm the Mack Daddy

[Hook]
Mack Daddy
All you all gameless marks know
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Yew

[Verse 3:]
I don't smoke no weed, but I like to G
I don't mean O.G., I mean sex baby
Cause a brother like me don't date
I sling records 'n tapes
The Rhyme Cartel with the Def American
Gettin' brothers sprung like Farrakhan
'N I'm stuffin' my ladies pumps
In the backa my Benz I humps
I'm nasty 'n proud
To hell with cool, I'm G'in' 'em loud
Other people at the hotel gets no rest
Cause Mix-a-lots bumpin' them headrests
She got booty for days
Other brothers is pullin' up, but she ain't phased
Cause I laid my game like a concrete slab
She's the kinda skirt a mack gotta have
Rollin', showin' her off
'N some fool tried to call me soft
He's in a one nine seven two skin head caddy
A old superfly mack daddy
So my girl stepped out 'n he tried to mack
But she ain't havin' that
You see your game is weak, G
My girl, I ain't slappin', I'm mackin'
'N rappin'

[Hook]
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
Mack Daddy
Come over here and get some of this snake
Mack Daddy
I'm the Mack Daddy
