Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Big man is back, oh no, it's a brand new flow
Lettin' you Jakes and females know
Ain't a damn thing changed and I still got dough
Still gettin' watched by Po-Po

You know what a flow like, never grab a ol' mic
Never been down wit the slow life
Baby, I'm a low life, lookin' for the right type
To get it goin' on for the whole night

King of the backside, look at my rep
One of these West Coast veterans
Known to lay bone and make miniskirts moan
Young hotty got me sittin' like stone

So, I'm at the Magic City
So many freaks in one spot, I'm dizzy
I'm a playa, so you know I wanna play
It ain't nuthin' like the city Blacklanta, GA

Now, I start lookin' through the mist
Swangin' my game like this
Wassup wit the table poppin'?
Fine, 5 feet, 9 inches and I'm jockin'

But the girl won't dance
And I pinch me a 10, 'bout to wet my pants
She got body fo' days but the girl won't flaunt it
You betta bark like you want it

Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Bow wow, bow wow, gimme my dog chow
Put me on a leash or else I'm gonna have to snap now
Humpin' yo' leg, this doggy don't beg
Got a tight rubber cap on my head

So, check this game when I'm comin' through the hood
Swingin' 'round blocks but I don't sell goods
Mad brothas mean mug 'cause they wish they would
Get a fine thang like I could

You bought a 6-4 wit the 3-wheel mo'
Got no females in ya passenger door
You wanna playa hate 'cause you just don't know
'Bout the fast track makin' yo hoe go

Damn baby, why don't you let me ride witchu? Here I go again
Done took yo' girl 'cause I don't like men
Got to the crib, romance don't phase me
Pulled to the house playin', freak me baby

Video check 1-2, 1-2
Me and baby girl's 'bout to get loose
And just when I thought I could palm it
You betta drop to yo' knees and bark like you want it

Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby
Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby
Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby
Woof, we want it, meow, come and get it, baby

Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like you want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby

Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
Woof, bark like we want it, woof, bark like you want it, baby
