[Intro Dialogue: E-Dawg & Filthy Rich]
[E-Dawg]
Oh yeah. It's E-D-O-G in the house for the nine-trey
I got my homeboy from the O
Filthy Rich in the house
What's up my nigga?
[Fithy Rich]
Oh you know, I'm just kicking it
Got the day, got the dre, got the bank, and it's all good
Hot weather, what you want to do today?
[E-Dawg]
You already know, my nigga
Drop the top and let's roll of these fools

[Verse 1: E-Dawg]
Creep with me as I roll through the hood
Triple go deep, drop top up to no good
Much bitches, switches for the three wheel motion
Keep niggas sprung while I'm coasting
Got the 9-Glock for the jackers
Nicknaming D-O-G, you get pecked out
So I let shit happen so I got to watch my back
Can't get caught slipping cause I might get attack
By a fool trying to steal my rims
Shoot him in the dome and give him a little head trim
And then I'm outtie cause 187 would get you locked up
And I ain't about to take that rap cause it's fucked up
So buck up, beware of the owner of the vehicle
Creeping real low in the motherfucking 6-4
Bumping the oldie from my homie, Rich James
Playing [I'm in love with Mary Jane]
Top down, looking around for some himmies
First stop, 7-11, for some Jimmies
Prop up, fucking in my system, craning and bouncing
Swinging to the rhythm as I'm rolling in my trizza

[Hook]
I'm rolling in my drop top and I don't plan to stop
Rolling in my drop top, doo doo-da-de-di-doo-du doo doo
Rolling in my drop top and I don't plan to stop
Rolling in my drop top

[Verse 2: Filthy Rich]
My man, I'm having those, so of course I got hoes
The alias is Filthy Rich so you know I got fours
That dope green dough, fat stacks at that
Take me a toke and I'm destined for the track
I'm mack with an ack, this smooth like fifth gear
Assume to die by my twenty fifth year here
You know the scipt, I'm not going out
Stabbing, drop tops, and cops is what lives about
Being a dog, walking like I'm E-Dawg, stressing like the Jetsons Tempted to push up claws of fog
Hopping state to state, a hog
Copping latex for them real hot dates, yup
I hate motel rates, I can't get dips at your crip, yous gots to wait
Time for some bank, pushing up on the phone, puts on twenties
Press up on the phone and ready to bone some slimmies
They know the time, tell your friend to bring some in
[What kind of friend?]
Let me see, it depends, I press send
Connect with the K-9, hot sons beeming hot drop top with the main line and I'm rolling

[Hook]
Rolling in my drop top and I don't plan to stop
Rolling in my drop top, doo doo-da-di-da-doo-du doo doo
Rolling in my drop top and I don't plan to stop
Rolling in my drop top

Oooo, my drop top, oooo
Baby, ooo, my drop top, baby
My drop top
Oooo yeah
