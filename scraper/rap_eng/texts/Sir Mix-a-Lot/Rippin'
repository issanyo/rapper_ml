[Verse 1]
I... Got a real fine freak with a real big butt
She gets real ill when she hears my cuts
Got two Cadillacs, one blue one gold
Got straps on the back with a fresh set of Vogues
Wheel in the back with a grill in the front
24-k strap on my trunk
Got a big gold rope cold laying on my neck
Got my freak in my arm cold kicking on set
Never get ill cause I'm too damn swass
Got a funky Trans-Am with a dual exhaust
T-town is live but Seattle is my home
Hood ornament is gold cause I don't like chrome

[Hook]
 That's rippn'  

[Verse 2]
I'm... Chillin' never illin' in the place to be
Down with m-i-x-a-l-o-t
On the west coast driving big Cadillacs
Snow white paint job with the wheel in the back
Suckas [?] cause they cannot hang
But you got to have a brain in the computerized game
You're getting jealous cause your girl wants to play my song
You know you want to hear it, put the record back on

[Hook]
That's rippn'
(Here in my car) Rolling down the avenue
(Here in my car) Picking up points
(Here in my car) Rolling in the Nissan
(Here in my car) Kicking my beats
(Here in my car) Wheel in the back
(Here in my car) Grill in the front
(Here in my car) Big Cadillac
(Here in my car) Bass in the back

[Verse 3]
I'm... I'm a real estate investor, hardcore dresser
Money counting brother and I hate polyester
Walking in my Gore-Tex steppin on [?]
Steel toed boots hate to do it like that
Cruise Broadway on my cellular phone
Spend a hundred thousand dollars on my number two home
Dog in the front yard, fence in the back
Ex-girl getting mad cause my paycheck's fat

[Hook]
That's rippn'

[Verse 4]
Rolling in my IROC kicking my beat
With my girl by my side looking oh so sweet
Gore-Tex on my feet, gold rope for my neck
Cold carry cash and I never write checks
Bankroll so big I can hardly hold it
You once had a dream that your grandma stole it
Punched her in the eye took my bank back
You ever wonder why I'm like that

[Hook]
Cause I'm rippn'

[Verse 5]
Yeah... You like this beat but it's time to change
Not gonna get ill but I'm gonna get strange
Push your partner throw 'em in the aisle
Gonna kick it live with the square dance style
I'm a ripping motherfucker that's my last name
When I pull tip freaks go insane
Benz on the left with a Caddy on the right
Gore-Tex in effect with my freaks tonight
Sucker on tip tried to get up in my face
Steel-toed rambo put the sucker in his place
Seven days a week I'm on vacation
Let's get live with the Kid Sensation
