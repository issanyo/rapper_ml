[Verse 1]
Riggidy-run for the hills 'cause the mack is back
I'm hookin' up girls by fax
If you're stacked
You can rub a big mack
I gotta gas
So don't worry about scraps (No no)
Five-foot-eleven with a seven-foot game
Got a big mouthpiece and I shows no shame
Monster kinky have no morals
Monster love to get oral (ummmm!)
Got ten cars and the girls like that
I was born and bred to be a mack
"What's your sign?" is played
You gotta put a little style in your game nowadays
In the sixties, girls was all high
LSD had 'em givin' up thighs
The baby boom was on and I dropped
No more Woodstock, but now you got Mix-A-Lot
So put me in your CD changer
Watch your girl, 'cause Mix'll rearrange her
Ooo, he's sexist!
Ooo, he's sexist!
Keepin' Rush Limbaugh restless
I'm da mack and that's monsta
Straight chase girls through the tail 'cause I wants ta
You can call it wack
But you respect this black
When it comes to game I'm a monsta mack

[Hook]
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm a monsta mack
Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Big mack, 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough

[Verse 2]
Strike the pose
But she ain't nasty as me
'Cause Mix-A-Lot is stuck on freaky
Can't stop tappin' that tweety
Give it to the needy
Nope, 'cause I'm too damn greedy
Here I go walking through the mall
Don't play ball
But I got game for 'em all
Focus on a victim, focus on a victim
Mr. Richard is hot, so let's sic 'em
And like a Tomahawk jumpin' on a SCUD
Girl, you got to gimme my pud
The pick-up king is back, buddy
Tryin' to give lessons to these thick-ass ballers and understudies
But I'm not tryin' to call you no bitch, girl
Don't give a damn if you're poor or rich, girl
And we can play a li'l pool
And I'm pokin' that 8-ball cool
And the booties
I still like the booties
She got a little waist, doin' squats just to keep me on my duty
Giant-size game's what I'm droppin'
Straight freaks with them thick ol' glutes is what I'm knockin'
Now the right-wing wanna test me
If likin' sex is a crime, then you arrest me
But don't tell me who to sing to, Jack
Cause a third of your life is in the sack
I'm a monsta mack

[Hook]
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm a monsta mack
Lookin' for sex 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Lookin' for sex 'cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough

[Verse 3]
Drivin' my car by the bus stop
'Til I spot a young cutie straight suckin' down a soda pop
Baby girl's winkin'
Mix-A-Lot's thinkin'
Hope this girl's feet ain't stinkin'
Here we go
Swingin' by Franglor's
And get a little soul food
Now you got a brother in the mood
Damn, gotta get her home with the quickness
'Cause this thickness, boy, you oughta witness
No need to put my girls on tilt
'Cause straight-up game'll get you milked
The nasty dog is back
With straight pimp game black
Ain't no shame
I'm a monsta mack

[Hook]
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Monsta mack, fool!
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
I'm the monsta mack!
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
Monsta mack, wit' big game, baby!
'Cause the Mix-A-Lot game is tough
