Sweet baby Jesus on fire
I'ma need a damn lawyer and a miracle
To pull my ass outta this
Devil kept poking the bull
So I shipped her ass to Mozambique
'Cause I was over it

Shoulda dumped my gat into the Verde
But what if she’s a zombie or a Dracula
I better hang onto this
Lordy, with my hand upon the bible
Swear I shot the damn devil not a bitch
But the po-po don’t give a shit

Lord, won’t you show a little mercy
I’ve been on the straight and narrow
Since the judge and the warden done parole me
Red poison devil kept a poking
So I shipped her ass to Mozambique
'Cause I was over it

I lost my head a bit
Please help me outta this

Goddamn judge found me guilty of public toxication
Public urination and parole violation
But the CSI couldn’t find the body
To corroborate my bullshit story

Sweet Jesus, don’t let the judge release me
What if she’s a zombie or a Dracula
And tries to fuckin' eat me?
Devil walked away from a bangin' trip to Mozambique

Help me outta this
Help me outta this
Help me outta this
Help me outta this
