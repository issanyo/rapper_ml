[Chorus:]
I know you see me watching you (You're so sexy, yeah)
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'

[Verse: Beyoncé]
I'm chillin at the spot
And my posse's 4 deep
Had my man on my mind
Turn my head, what did I see?
The fellas lookin' fly
And there was one that caught my eye
So I bit my lip, switched my hips as I walked by
Saying sexy boy, you're so fly
I just might give you a try
I'ma write yo number in the palm of my hand
Oops, I forgot, I got a man

[Chorus:]
I know you see me watching you (You're so sexy, yeah)
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me

[Verse: Beyoncé]
I'm thinkin' to myself
'Should I even take a chance?'
'Should I do what's on my mind, or should I stay down with my man?'
This boy got me fiendin'
And I'm wantin' him so bad
Should I chill one night with him and risk everything I had?
Saying sexy boy, you so fly
I wish I could give you a try
But my man's at home waiting for me by the phone
Sorry, can't get my groove on!

[Chorus:]
I know you see me watching you (You're so sexy, yeah)
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me
I know you see me watching you
The I see you watching me
'Cause boy your body's callin'
The temptation is killin' me

[Bridge:]
Temptation is callin'
Papi, wantin' you so bad I could cry

To do what's wrong but I gotta do right
Temptation is callin'
Papi, wantin' you so bad I could cry
