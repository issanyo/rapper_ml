Get busy!

[Verse 1]
Sir Mix-A-Lot Ray, the ultimate freak
I'm so cute in a suit, my beats conceit
Intelligent freak, wardrobe complete
You can fold my robe if you be my freak
I got a big Cadillac with the bass in the back
Try to take my freak, boy you must be whack
Bicep's flex, so kiss my neck
Buying pounds of gold with royalty checks
And I'm Swass ...

[Hook]
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me (swass)
Don't you wish your boyfriend was swass like me

[Verse 2]
Cold gettin live in a fresh fruit vest
I'm the king of the beat in the great northwest
Packin more dollars than Chase Manhattan
After each show my billfold fattens, yep
My phone be ringin like you wish yours would
But my girl stays cool cause she looks so good
Punk mother *puh-hicka* called me weak
Just turn up the bass and feel this beat
Feel my bass drum ...

[Break]
("Stop it, get silly, swass") - 4X

("Stop it, get silly, swass") - backwards - 4X

[Verse 3]
Now the ground be shakin, when my bass drum's breakin
("Stop it, get silly, swass")
Suckers in the crowd think the boy be fakin
("Stop it, get silly, swass" - backwards)
Now put this beat in your Nissan truck
("Stop it, get silly, swass")
But don't start cryin when your woofers get stuck
("Stop it, get silly, swass" - backwards)
Check it out ...

(*solo of the beat*)
Hit bigger!

[Verse 4]
23 points when I count my bank
All imitators I will spank
I'm a freak and I know it, so why not show it
I design my rhymes like a worldwide poet
NEW freaks every week in my contract
So cold with the rap you'll get contact
Innovative beats with a brand new twist
Don't you wish your man could rock like this
Break it down ...

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Eighty dollar slippers to wash my car
It attracts more freaks than a beach lifeguard
Imitate me, it can bring about pain
Better wear dark shades when you look at my chain
Swass, point, no introduction
I come complete with free instructions
I work for myself, don't have no boss
Boy you gotta have brains if you wanna be swass
And I'm swass ...

[Interlude - Female talking]
Oh Mix-A-Lot you know I want to, (repeated backwards) - 4X

[Hook] - 6X
