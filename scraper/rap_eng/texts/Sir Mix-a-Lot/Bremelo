[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Here's a gory kind a story about a obese freak
With a 40-inch waist and a 10-inch beak
Overweight and out of shape with a triple chin
Her brassiere strikes fear in the hearts of men

The girl's a Bremelo
The girl's a Bremelo

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Me and Terry hopped the ferry we were looking swass
When a dip hit the ship we were almost tossed
It was a big Bremelo standing on my toe
An enormous jelly belly trying to say hello
I was really kind of frightened as she looked my way
I tried to run because her buns made the ferry sway
To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat
On the way to Bremerton were the fat is at

The girl's a Bremelo
Let's go

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
I'm not fakin' or mistaken bout the big ole duck
She had hairy underarms and a whopping gut
Her hair was short and wavy, drove my pitbull crazy
A Bremerton beast chasing fellas in the Navy
After movie she's the feature, the Bremerton creature
You wear a lifejacket if you ever try to freak her
You look at her physique she ain't my kinda freak
The floor creaks when the beast starts reaching her peak

[Break - Sir Mix-A-Lot]
The girl's a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo
Change the beat!
(*beat changes, then changes back to the original*)

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
You can't ignore the way she snores, cause she blows down doors
Baby's got the kind a face only a mother adores
A big basketball head with the 10-inch feet
Big lips, no hips with the smell of a beast
I couldn't put her in my Caddy or my tranny would break
I heard of dirt because of poverty, but she took the cake
When it comes to Kool-Aid the girl would drink it in pints
You go to school for twenty years and your still in the ninth?

You're just a Bremelo
Just a Bremelo

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
You big triple-chin unattractive duck
Your boyfriend beats freaks up to make a buck
Hanging round 3rd and Pike, on a ten-speed bike
You can say that I'm a liar, but you know I'm right
You talk behind my back, because I dropped you flat
And you never take a shower cause your too damn fat
So your man was smart when he broke your heart
Because if Mix-A-Lot had cut ya, you'd a fell apart
Wearing polyester slacks, with elastic in the back
You could flatten Schwarzenegger in a wrestling match
You got lips like a character in some cartoon
With a pink posterior, you big baboon

Your just a (*sound of a elephant yelling*)
(*sound of elephant yelling*)

[Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Now Bremerton's a city right outside of mine
Most girls there are ducks, but a few are fine
But the ones that I speak about
Used their face for catching trout
Vacuum cleaners for a mouth
You know what I'm talking about
Mud ducks, hockey pucks, drivers of Mack trucks
Lame brains, diesel trains, pick 'em up you have to strain
Big butt, crew cut, extraordinary gut
Big momma, kinda buff, facial hairs are kinda rough

[Outro - Sir Mix-A-Lot - talking]
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
Girl's a Bremelo
Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck
(*pig grunting noises are mixed in with word "duck"*)
The girl's a Bremelo
"duck" - repeated until fade
