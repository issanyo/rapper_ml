[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I... Got a real fine freak with a real big butt
She gets real ill when she hears my cuts
Got two Cadillacs, one blue one gold
Got straps on the back with a fresh set of Vogues
Wheel in the back with a grill in the front
24-k strap on my trunk
Got a big gold rope cold laying on my neck
Got my freak in my arm cold kicking on set
Never get ill cause I'm too damn swass
Got a funky Trans-Am with a dual exhaust
T-town is live but Seattle is my home
Hood ornament is gold cause I don't like chrome

[Hook]
 That's rippn'  

[Verse 2: Kid Sensation]
I'm... Chillin' never illin' in the place to be
Down with m-i-x-a-l-o-t
On the west coast driving big Cadillacs
Snow white paint job with the wheel in the back
Suckas [?] cause they cannot hang
But you got to have a brain in the computerized game
You're getting jealous cause your girl wants to play my song
You know you want to hear it, put the record back on

[Hook]
That's rippn'
(Here in my car) Rolling down the avenue
(Here in my car) Picking up points
(Here in my car) Rolling in the Nissan
(Here in my car) Kicking my beats
(Here in my car) Wheel in the back
(Here in my car) Grill in the front
(Here in my car) Big Cadillac
(Here in my car) Bass in the back

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I'm... I'm a real estate investor, hardcore dresser
Money counting brother and I hate polyester
Walking in my Gore-Tex steppin on [?]
Steel toed boots hate to do it like that
Cruise Broadway on my cellular phone
Spend a hundred thousand dollars on my number two home
Dog in the front yard, fence in the back
Ex-girl getting mad cause my paycheck's fat

[Hook]
That's rippn'

[Verse 4: Kid Sensation]
Rolling in my IROC kicking my beat
With my girl by my side looking oh so sweet
Gore-Tex on my feet, gold rope for my neck
Cold carry cash and I never write checks
Bankroll so big I can hardly hold it
You once had a dream that your grandma stole it
Punched her in the eye took my bank back
You ever wonder why I'm like that

[Hook]
Cause I'm rippn'

[Verse 5: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Yeah... You like this beat but it's time to change
Not gonna get ill but I'm gonna get strange
Push your partner throw 'em in the aisle
Gonna kick it live with the square dance style
I'm a ripping motherfucker that's my last name
When I pull tip freaks go insane
Benz on the left with a Caddy on the right
Gore-Tex in effect with my freaks tonight
Sucker on tip tried to get up in my face
Steel-toed rambo put the sucker in his place
Seven days a week I'm on vacation
Let's get live with the Kid Sensation

Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi
Ichi Ni San Shi

[Verse 6: Kid Sensation]
Now... It's time to get illin' just one more time
Kid Sensation with a hardcore rhyme
Freaks on my tip cause my muscles are rip
Keep the girlies coming with my bullwhip
All sucker DJ's I will swat
Cold ill hip-hoppin' with Mix-A-Lot
I rock this poem and the girls are sprung
Cause I'm ripping that scale seventeen years young

[Hook]
That's rippn'

[Verse 7: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Rolling down the avenue picking up points
I like to count bank but I don't roll joints
I'm a hardcore b-boy sitting on a throne
Always hanging on the ave, cold grabbing that bone
Girlies in Cal like to feel my beat
Great big Gore-Tex get more freaks
Some sucker MC's say they can't feel it
But I bet you'd be happy if I let you steal it

[Hook]
That's rippn'

[Verse 8: Kid Sensation]
Freaks get your hands high in the air
The big bass drum gonna press your hair
We're ripping hip-hoppers on the hip-hop set
Saying rhyme after rhyme and still don't sweat
Paralyzing perpetrators, punching out punks
Got a funky sound that's a sure slam dunk
Funky fresh dressing never faking like a faker
Ripping it awake is the real big maker

[Verse 9: Sir Mix-A-Lot]
Our boots hit the ground all MC's scatter
Cement cracks, all windows shatter
Call my home-B ready to flatter
Don't get wild or you'll get splattered
