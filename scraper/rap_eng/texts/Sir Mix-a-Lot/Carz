They call me Mister Lamborghini
See me, believe me, we be
Hittin themem twistes
Ya'll can’t believe these crazy SV’s big wings
Verde Ithaca, bright green
Ferrari Scuderia
F1 quick click and see ya
Hot shifting at 60 mils
And a prancing horse in the fender shields
Maybe you’ll see us
Cars and coffee raise up off me
Poppa might get an Enzo
Or black Phantom with the smoked out windows
599 is fine
To 60 3.5
Swoop through scoop your daughter
Got a 4-5-8 on order
And my cars got miles, garage queens, that’s your style
LP 560
Batman grey with the ccb’s
And the LCD’s
Flash the peace signs cause you can’t catch these

We love these cars, I keep my right foot planted cops can’t stand it
We love these cars, turn off my phone, hear these tones
I love a car, I like to whip it, I love a car I like to whip it, I love 'em
We love these cars, keep my suspension stiff I never drift
We love these cars, this whip it clean, watch me sheen
I love a car, I like to whip it, I love a car I like to whip it, I love 'em

I ain't no collector, you drive them thangs and I might respect ya
And even know I’m getting older I ride my shit and holluh fuck you posers
(rent-a-car-rappers) Fuck you posers, (iced out wheels), fuck you posers
Hood long, big coupe but it still’s got balls
Murdered out black Ferrari six twelve skag parties
Out at Tom’s house, he got the big white Phantom chrome mouth
Try to catch my crew, fuck us?, fuck you too
Porscha CGT big pimping at the RTC
Clicked up whipped up
Picking up D-cups, chicks up
The sound of Mikes Gallardo
(noise) sometime I follow
Northwest Auto Salon
Clean the whips, shine em & gone
And Benchmark makes it pound
Yall should hear this fucking sound

We love these cars, I keep my right foot planted cops can’t stand it
We love these cars, turn off my phone, hear these tones
I love a car, I like to whip it, I love a car I like to whip it, I love 'em
We love these cars, keep my suspension stiff I never drift
We love these cars, this whip it clean, watch me sheen
I love a car, I like to whip it, I love a car I like to whip it, I love 'em

Carbon fiber, guts fat, SLR in matte black
Couple that with a GT 2 and finish my garage with a drophead coupe
My LP 640, doors up when I’m acting naughty
What you know about a Veryon, Bugatti shakes the body like heroine
Can you fuck with a SSC production shit hittin 260
And the Yankees come with the Corvette CR1
GTC, nothing flows like a droptop Bentley
CL63, 22s on a MBZ
And out everyday an R8, hit the spot and they hate
Aston Martin DBS interior blessed
And even when I'm low key
I'm in a fat S class on the HRE
65 AMG, push start and fuck the keys

We love these cars, We love these cars, I love a car, I love a car
I love 'em X 2

We love these cars, I keep my right foot planted cops can’t stand it
We love these cars, turn off my phone, hear these tones
I love a car, I love a car, I love 'em
We love these cars, keep my suspension stiff I never drift
We love these cars, this whip it clean, watch me sheen
I love a car, I love a car, I love 'em

We love these cars, We love these cars, I love a car, I love a car
I love 'em X 4
