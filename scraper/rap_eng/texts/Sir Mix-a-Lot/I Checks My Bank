I'm peelin' off domes with a baseball bat
Forty-four Magnum, choice of gat
Mercury tip fillin' up my clip, I can shoot him
In the dome or I can get him in the hip

But boom, look at all the niggas runnin' out the room
Just another soldier, causin' doom, no, I don't bang
But I like to wound my enemy, who is the enemy?
I'm glad you asked any motherfucker standin' in my path

Got a Bentley Turbo, now you wanna jack
But remember, Mack Daddy is strapped
And when your platinum niggas start dissin'
Record companies think you're missin'

But I'm back, I'm back
I'm back and I got a bigger gat
Now the positive rhymes is on
And I'm positively hittin' that dome

You might want mine but you can't get mine
Rather put a hot nine right up in your behind
I'm not the nigga that you wanna recoup
And I don't wear a Giorgio suit

But I'm down for my business so please don't step
You heard about my law firm's rep, I check my bank

Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, checkin' my bank
Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, ahh I checks my bank

Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, straight checkin' my bank
Cash money, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash money

In the magazine I look like a dope, man
'Cause I'm paid and I'm suckin' up to no man
And in the rap game, I gets no respect
'Cause I'm checkin' more bank than the heat check

Yeah, I'm a pimp and my hoe is the system
Uncle Sam might think I just dissed him
But nah, I'm just pumpin' straight facts
You either be a mack or you get macked

Some of the jealous wanna roll on the boss
But this HK's keepin' 'em tossed
'Cause I duck them deuce, deuce treys
At point blank range, attitudes get changed

I'm about making these dividends
And every motherfucker ain't my friend
And I check my back when I count my snaps
And niggas that snatch get slapped

Girls wanna roll, that's cool
But I'm not to be played that fool
Some niggas think a brother with money is slippin'
But I've be down, so quit trippin'

My goal to increase the size of this bank
I hold and bring up the brothers whose down
To roll and keep all the shit under my control
That's how I'm livin', I check my bank

Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, checkin' my bank
Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, ahh I checks my bank

Cash money, cash, cash money
Boom, here I am, rich, straight checkin' my bank
Cash money, cash, cash, cash, cash, cash money

Cash money, cash, cash money
Clockin' more dollars than Chase Manhattan
Cash money, cash, cash money
Clockin' more dollars than Chase Manhattan

I check my bank, come on punish
Cash money

A word to the cops, I can't be stopped
A word to my enemies, I don't drop props
A word to the Klan, I don't pick crops
You can run up with your whip
But you'll just run up and get popped

A word to the Tipper, rap won't fall
A word to the bourgeoisie, fuck all y'all
A word to Apartheid, you 'bouts to fall
You can kill a couple brothers but you'll never get us all

Straight laced game's what I'm poppin' at the new jacks
Mack Daddy, niggas like to snatch fat sacks
I used to be nice with my rhymes and now I drop dimes
What's the time?

It's time to get paid in the nine-two G
Recession never stopped a nigga like me
I'm breakin' no laws but I'm livin' on edge
Puttin' CEO's to bed

Business straight yankin' in dead presidents
It's like sellin' dope, but the money ain't bent
The game is stiff, but I'ma get mine
My set is a dollar sign, I check my bank

Yup, checkin' my bank, fool, ha, ha
Yup, I check my bank, shit
Straight checkin' my bank
Come on, punish, punish 'em, punish 'em

Show these DJ's what time it is
Punish peace out y'all, and I'm checkin' my bank
I checks my bank, I checks my bank, straight paid clown
Checkin' my bank, I checks my bank
