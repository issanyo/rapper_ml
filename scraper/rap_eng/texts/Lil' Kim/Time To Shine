Mmmmmm (uhh Junior M.A.F.I.A.)
It's my time to shine (peace to all originals)
Ohhhhh (peace to all the gods)
Yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. the clique! whooooo

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Blessed by the God, so I be the Earths
Queen B Bitch, Poppa keep me rich
Ain't gun tottin', keep floatin in them automobiles
Pack with steel, engines filled with Benjamins
I got half a mill stashed in the [?]
For womanizers and a hand full of hoes that hate
But lately, it seems people make the world go round
From A to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically
Pethtically, I puts the pressure
In ya Jones bet you fall like a Motorol Burn Out
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block
HDM lock, and I wish you would stop
All that bawlin', cryin'
Lyin', 'cause this black Queen is shinin'
You didn't know I was Lieutenant, bitch, well that's primary
You just a secondary secretary
Envy against me
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce & Gabanna
And people love me for my style, my personal
Niggas go wild and want to have my child
Bet I just sit back and enjoy
The optimism given from a girl to a boy (that's what it's all about)
It's all about the ones the guns just another day that earth lose a son

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on

Yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. click
Yeah Junior M.A.F.I.A. click

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
We all know what it means to be broke, breaking niggas off
For some X and some Smoke , some like to mix it with rocks
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin'
And I put the lent in ya dents
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought
Before you quit your job at the airport
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame
No fame, no name, show no shame
Who's to blame? (Tell me [?] you want it)
Now you wanna lick a shot 'cause you ain't got
Get props, runnin' up in niggas' spots
Just a little gets to make cash
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash
Quick fast, get mad, 'cause ya man's in my whip
Honey, button ya lip 'cause my clit is too thick
It's all about the guns, the ones
Just another day that the Earth lose a son

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on

[Bridge: Mona Lisa]
Hey baby it's about time to shine
We're movin' on
Keep it going strong
Can't stop what's going on
Hey baby it's about time to shine
We're movin' on
Keep it going strong
Can't stop what's going on
JM and Kim keep movin' on

[Chorus: Mona Lisa]
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
It's my time to shine
Been down for much too long
I've gotta get mine
JM and Kim keep movin' on
