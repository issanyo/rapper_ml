[Verse 1: G&B]
I said enough to make you stop
I spit game 'til the panties drop
Ladies claim I'm a playa but I'm not
I just know how to kick what I got
And we can cruise in my cream drop top
Set me up like a thief in the night
Love the way them jeans fit that ass so tight
So tight
So if you wanna slide with me
Baby come and take a ride with me
Pretty eyes hypnotizing me
Steal my heart like a robbery
Oh oh

[Chorus: G&B]
Freak freak (Ya'll)
Baby girl it's on
Got the candles lit wit a bucket of Dom
Toot toot (Ya'll)
And when I beep my horn
Drop top non stop 2 seconds now we gone
Freak freak (Ya'll)
You know how I get
Tryna lay you down
And see how rough we get
Toot toot (Ya'll)
And when I beep my horn
Hop in witcha tricks in a velvet thong

[Verse 2: G&B]
HOT
Tight jeans baby blue Tee top
I see you took from your moms not your pops
Body so sick make the traffic stop
And if you want we can hit the next spot
Bounce hop let our bodies interlock
You best believe I'ma give you all I got
And once I do I'ma have you on lock
On lock
If you wanna slide with me
Baby come and take a ride with me
Pretty eyes hypnotizing me
Steal my heart like a robbery
Oh oh

Repeat Chorus

GIRL COME HERE

Repeat Chorus

Life is what you make it
So hold it my dear
Hit me on the pager
And I'll be right over
