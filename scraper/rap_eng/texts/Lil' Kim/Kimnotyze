[Intro: Lil' Kim]
Gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo

[Hook: Lil' Kim & Trooper Da Don]
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This is why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

[Part 1: Lil' Kim]
I'm a big dog, ya'll don't wanna uh with me
I rule on the streets like a trucker, B
Move out my way when it's time to get paid
What you know about hydraulics on the Escalade?
We hit switches like they do in Cali
'Cept we ain't in 6-4s we low ridin' Denalis
Lexus, Vipers, eating up the flow
Straight-out Swordfish with the TVR
Lil' Kim and Tomekk, we so hot, we burning
Give it to you in English, put it down in German:
Gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo!
Said, "Roll right or don't roll at all!"
Now, getcha walk on, getcha rub on
All my Gs in the club, getcha thug on
Getcha name back, putcha bling on
Big ballas at the bar, getcha drink on
Blow the smoke out, getcha steam on
Low riders hittin' switches, getcha lean on
Getcha name back, putcha mack on
And if I hear you talkin' yak, getcha smack on!

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

[Part 2: Trooper Da Don & (Lil Kim)]
Kim, Ich bin horny – Yell, ich geb' dir von vorne
Troop, Lil Kim, DJ Tomekk
Wieder werd' ich Nummer 1, wah dann, wah dann, wah dann, wah dann?
Bei dir gibt's so viel zu seh'n, da gibt's keine Logik, nix zu versteh'n
Kimmie, willst du mit mir geh'n?
Verlier' mein' Verstand, ja, das muss ich gesteh'n
Mein Feuer, das brennt lichterloh
Von Karlsruhe bis nach Itzehoe
Du treibst es auf die Spitze, Hoe
(gib's mir richtig, ganz egal wo!)
In der Küche auf'm Herd, in der Scheune auf'm Pferd
Auf dem Parkplatz derb, und danach noch mehr
(ganz egal wo!)
Und ich weiß, es gefällt dir sehr
Kim, ich weiß genau, was ich tun soll
Und es ist ein tolles Gefühl, oh why!

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid
Kimmie, Kimmie, Kimmie – can't you see?
Sometimes your style just hypnotize me
And I just love your sexy ways
This why they're broke and you're so paid

[Outro: Lil' Kim]
„Hahaha, ganz egal wo!“
