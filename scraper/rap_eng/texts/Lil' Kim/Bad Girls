[Intro: RuPaul]
Oh yes, your bitch is back
Just when you thought it was safe to go into the water
Lil' Kim gon' push the shit a little farther
Hey, Lil' Kim, this is RuPaul and I have one thing to say to you
You better work!

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet told him park it
Then I jumps out the Zora, Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R L-S is in the stretch LS
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bulgari perfume from a mile you smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'ma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill'
Depending how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites, never get into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes
'Cause we

[Hook: RuPaul]
Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
You done picked the wrong one to start trouble with
Don't you know who you fucking with?
QB, the bad girl from the ghetto
That bitch rock mics in high heel stilettos
Spiked out chokers, piped out Rovers
We coked up like Coca-Cola
When we come through it's like 12 bulldozers
9 times out of 10 we ain't sober
We takin' over like Frances
Switchin' our styles like the hottest new dances
And we don't give a fuck so we take chances
To get large like breast enhancements
Bitches be hatin', sayin' we freaks
See us in the street, break they neck to speak
I ignore them whores, accept my applause
Then I say "cheese" for the paparrazi

[Hook: RuPaul]
Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[Bridge: Lil' Kim]
Hey fellas (what?)
Ain't I a dime? (hell yeah, hell yeah)
Hey sistas (uh huh)
Do I have the tightest rhymes? (hell yeah, hell yeah)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I'm on some freak shit tonight, think I ain't
I hope you don't mind a little ketchup on your frank
Either you with it, or either you ain't
You know how it is when Aunt Dot cock block
I beat my niggas with a whip
I breast feed niggas with my tit
And if I catch my man with a chick
I get on some Lorena Bobbitt shit, what

[Hook: RuPaul]
Bad girl, bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl, uh huh
Bad girl, you bad girl, you such a dirty bad girl

[RuPaul]
Oh yes the bitch is back
She's a bad bitch
Yeah, don't let the smooth taste fool you
See Little Kim got it goin' on
You better work, bitch
When she's good, she's good
But when she's bad, she's better
Hey, she's a bad girl!
