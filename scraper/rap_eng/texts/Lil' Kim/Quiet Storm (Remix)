[Rain and thunder in the background]

[Intro: Prodigy & Lil' Kim]
In broad daylight get right..
Just been through it all man
Blood, sweat, and tears
Niggas is dead and shit
What the fuck else can happen yo?
I don't think much more son, word to mother yo
We done seen it all, and been through it all yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother for real, for real
Queen Bee baby, that shit is the truth
Lil' Kim, B.I.G

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Yo, blowin' niggas with rusty-ass German things
Keepin' it thorough is our motherfuckin' claim to fame
Throw on your wetsuit, when it rains it pours and all
Hit 'em with the four
Don't even know him from a hole in the wall
Get at me, niggas wanna clap me
Snitches wanna rat me? Put it right where they back be
Keep my Dunns close to me, enemies even closer
Sendin' kites with the Motorolas, yo
Give 'em the cold shoulder with a hollow-tip to match
Bad apple outta the batch, obsessed with gats
Since a little dude, eating niggas food buck-fifty's
Niggas can kill me but they comin' wit me
How about that, send the Queen Bee to attack
Only a fly bitch like that can leave em relaxed
Rock 'em to sleep, make 'em think the drama is dead
Yo, I smile up in your face though I'm plottin' instead (uhh, uhh)

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Hot damn ho, here we go again
Light as a rock, bitch, hard as a cock, bitch
This shit knock for blocks through hardtops
In the parking lots
Where my nigga Roc like to spark-a-lot
My Brooklyn style speak for itself
Like a wrestler, another notch under my belt
The embezzler, chrome treasurer
The U-N-O competitor
I'm ten steps ahead of ya
I'm a leader, y'all on some followin' shit
Comin' in this game on some modeling shit
Bitches suck cock just to get to the top
I put a hundred percent in every line I drop
It's the Q to the B, with the M-O, B-B
Queensbridge Brooklyn and we D-double-E-P, what
Y'all wish I lived the life I live
Ayo Prodigy, tell 'em what this is Dunn, uhh, uhh

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, I could never get enough of it, yo that's my shit
I need that shit, to boost my adrenaline
Yo, rock that shit
That real life shit
Makes bitches wanna thug it
Makes the projects love it
We come through like, fuck it
Y'all want problems, pursue it, let's do it
Infamous Mobb bosses, check out the portrait
At the round table, my Dunn speaking with his Twin ghost
It's gangster how we rock, while you watch
Attracted to our style, this is how we get down
With big jewelry and big guns
We get busy, it get grizzly, beat niggas bloody
Twist niggas fronting, get to running
Fore the mens get to dumping, the fans get to thumping
M-O-B-B got the whole spot jumping
When my niggas step in the place
Damn, you gotta love it

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

Yo, it's the real shit
Shit to make you feel shit
Thump 'em in the club shit
Have you wilding out (hip-hop, hip-hop...) when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD 'cause it's never enough

[Outro: Lil' Kim]
It's the real
Hah, it's the real baby
Hip-hop hip-hop hip-hop..
