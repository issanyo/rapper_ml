Thanks Dick
We're standing here in front of the federal detention centre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Where Brooklyn's own, Lil' Kim is scheduled to be released from incarceration
As you can hear behind me, her loyal fans are anxiously awaiting her release
And, needless to say, they are hyped
Hold, on Dick
She's coming, right now
(Applause whilst paparazzi shout for Kim's attention)
