[Intro: Beenie Man]
It's a DJ Clue Production

Buuuuuummbaaaaa!!! Star!!! Yo yo!!!
America, Carribean, a matter a fact the world, we're comin' at you
Kim, where you at babe?

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Gyal flex, time to have sex
Jump in a your lex steam a blunt pop a Becks
Now you know that my style is rated XXX
Just lookin ain't a gal you no have nuff respect
I use to rock Sergio Tacchini, C And G bikinis
Now I'm hot steppin in my Queen Bee collection
Got gear to match my whips from monday to sunday
Designers give me exclusives straight off the runway
That's how it is, my shit is laid out
Some of y'all show up but like jeans y'all fade out, whatever
Fly out the crew hit the beach in Miami
Niggas watch me shake my fanny in my iced out panties
Beenie Man and Likkle Kim callin out (Beenie Man: Shout!!!)
People from east, west, north, and south
Say I'm the emcee with the nasty mouth
Put that on my unborn kids, we do it way big

[Hook: Beenie Man (Lil' Kim)]

And kick up and a real like a man she waan fight, alright
Open up your legs dem wide and let me get inside that, and wuk you all night
