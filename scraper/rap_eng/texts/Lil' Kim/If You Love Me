[Hook:]
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it front of them
Boy you ain't gotta front for none of them
If you love me you would tell them that I'm your girl
If you love me you would say it in front of the world

[Verse 1:]
If you love me, you would let the world know it
You say it out your mouth, but I'd rather your heart show it
Actions speak louder than words
Angels fly higher than birds
This was God's work but you couldn't see
God blessed you when he sent you to me
See your boys don't see a side that I see
I told you, you ain't gotta front for the streets
We were born to ride, Bonnie and Clyde
Like your favourite gun, I was right by your side
See my love is true, yeah you know its true
Everything is all fucked up because of you

[Hook:]
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it front of them
Boy you ain't gotta front for none of them
If you love me you would tell them that I'm your girl
If you love me you would say it in front of the world

[Verse 2]
I need a real dude I can deal with
Share a family and house on the hill with
Take trips to Paris not the Hiltons
I'm talking about France, true romance
Walk the red carpet together and hold hands
Style on the haters, wave at the fans
Cause right now our love don't live here
First to reconcile, something gotta give here
Few niggas out there trying to live here
Put a ring on it, drop a few kids here
Yeah, Happy Valentines Day
But if you really love me you would show me every day, every day, every day

[Hook:]
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
If you love me you would say it front of them
Boy you ain't gotta front for none of them
If you love me you would tell them that I'm your girl
If you love me you would say it in front of the world

[Bridge:]
Be-Be-Beyonc√© and Jay, I could have been us
But it's no trust, and all we do if fuss
Yeah, Happy Valentines Day
But if you really love me you would show me every day, every day, every day

[Hook:]
If you love me you would say it front of them
Boy you ain't gotta front for none of them
If you love me you would tell them that I'm your girl
If you love me you would say it in front of the world
