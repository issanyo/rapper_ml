[Intro: Lil Kim]
I got a feeling
I got a feeling

[Hook: Droc] (x2)
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whipping and whipping
Somebody watching me
I'm in the club making it rain, somebody watching me

[Verse 1: Droc]
I got feeling, nobody stopping me
Bad bitch on top of me, smoking that broccoli
Diamonds all on me, I feel like I'm Tony
When I hit the woe, it's only my homies
Paparazzi be on me, they act like they know me
I ball like I'm Kobe, you balling then show me
I whip it, I whip it, I whip it, I whip it, you know that I got it
She stick it, she stick it, she stick it, she chop up the block

[Hook: Lil Kim]
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whipping and whipping
Somebody watching me
I'm in the club making it rain, somebody watching me

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
They so obsessed with the Queen B
They be watching me like Netflix
I'm the first bitch, I'm the last bitch
I got now and then I got next bitch
I don't know what they talking 'bout
'Cause I'm the only one that they talking 'bout
And what the fuck is we talking 'bout
If we ain't talking about them large amounts
I can feel the binoculars
Somebody watching me
Just flooded the road
These haters be clocking me
I stay on go like monopoly
Buying and selling that property
I'm basically a mythology
They buying my bibliography
I'm a star this my astrology
Highway or my way, no democracy
Diamonds be dancing with me no choreography
I talk that Louboutin terminology
My man crazy, he be stalking me
Like a GPS in my pussy
He said my kitty like a diamond mine
He pulled the Kohinoor out my pussy

[Hook: Droc]
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whipping and whipping
Somebody watching me
I'm in the club making it rain, somebody watching me

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
I got a feeling, somebody watching me
Young nigga, got too much guap on me
Niggas done fucked up, for letting me get all this broccoli
They say money rule the world, well a nigga ain't stopping me
Yeah, up in my city they know I'm the man
Haters be wishing they fuck up my plans
But I just be going so hard, thinking I'm in the kitchen whipping some pans
Bitch I'm the man, Bitch I'm the man
That's the reason they be watching me, they know a nigga getting broccoli

[Hook: Droc] (x2)
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I got a feeling somebody watching me
I'm in the kitchen, I'm whipping and whipping
Somebody watching me
I'm in the club making it rain, somebody watching me
