Yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Lil' Kim]
Bitches wanna front on 'em
Know not to come in
I keep ten Glocks, ten rocks up in front of 'em
Like they sprayin' somethin', like they sayin' somethin'
Get my bark on like I'm DMX or somethin' (what?!)
My music's like Lewis, stiff 84
Yours is like Evander, seventy-seven slow
Thanks to Tae Bo, I'm 32 and "O"
When I catch a knock out, bitches bring the cops out
Two for five spots, I tear the rocks out
Pop the tops out, they clear the spot out
Nigga or bitch, you don't want no problems
My revolver is a quick problem solver
Don't ever think I'm slippin'
Bitch I ain't dumb
I carry a stun gun inside of my hair bun
Hatin' ass niggas, I treat you like a bitch
Strap on a fake dick, and stick you where you shit (ha ha)

Chorus

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing

[Lil' Kim]
Took three years off to map my shit out
Switch up my game plan and get closer to God
Give me an inch, I take a yard
Oh lighten up, ya'll knew I was comin' back real hard
By the power that's vested in me
Faith rested in me
I can't quit now, too much money's invested in me
To my nigga B-I, this ones for you baby!
All these niggas wanna be Kings, but fuck, is these niggas crazy?
Imma hold the spot for ya (yeah!)
Keep it locked for ya (yeah!)
Rock for you, Pop, ain't a nigga I won't drop for you
Bitches want my title, there ain't a slot for you
It's a cold, cold world, I keep it hot for you
(What?!) Ya'll cats know who I am
(What?!) I love those who love Lil' Kim
(What?!) I'm back again, the mic' eater
The dick beater, the pussy skeeter
But I...

Chorus

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing

[Lil' Kim]
Put five carats on the "Fuck you" finger
Any haters in the crowd, give them the "Fuck you" finger
If you think you can ball with the Queen
Handle repercussions
Our guns bust in English and in Russian
На здоровье королева мы говорим по русский до свидания
Niggas stand in line, pay a fee for me to kiss 'em
Twenty-one's the lucky number, once the "E" is in the system
One night with the Q.B., and niggas need maturity
Keep my pussy tight like the President's security
I'm sometimin', that's right, I change like the year
Bring chips from the Casino, then throw them in the air
I'm the Queen!
I've got special privileges
We ain't equivalent, how dare you insult my intelligence
Now I would like you all to recite the words to this song
Cause you thought I was goin'
But the Queen lives on!

Chorus

Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
Come you all, come and hail the Queen
Everybody let me hear you sing
