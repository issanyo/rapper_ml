Uh-Ready to battle you
Lyrically f*ck you up
And rattle you
Bitch'll write sh*t for ya
And still spit sh*t harder than the average dude
What i'm saying is coming genuine is a must
But you're a opposed to that idea
So in a bit i'll have to sweep yo ass off like dust
It kind of puts me up in f*ckin rage
To see a bitch Nickel-less like Cage
But when you try to take my stage
You get turned like a page
Your fake sh*t dont amuse us
F*ck puttin five on it like The Luniz
Funk this bitch so hard have it smelling like tuna
I put three Gs on this bet
That my sh*t drop hard like the Valujet
Some of my hard flows will keep your niggas dick erect
The others i'm ghost writting for ya to keep your sh*t comming correct
I'm Scary like the f*ckin' Spice
Leave you steamed like a bowl of rice
Yeah my sh*t was nasty back in 96'
Talked about my pussy and every n*ggas' dick
But it's 99 and yall bout to see what a real bitch is about
F*ck niggas they ain't sh*t, now i'm about having clout
This is all straight from knowledge now peace mutha f*cka i'm out
