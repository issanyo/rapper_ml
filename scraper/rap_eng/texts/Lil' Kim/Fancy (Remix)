[Intro: Lil' Kim]
Yeah, you already know what it is
It's the G-Mix
I-I-G-G-Y
K-I-M-M-Y

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Who dat? Who dat? K-I-M-M-Y
Fly girl, I should have my own airline
Chanel belt, couple thousand on my waistline
I might waste money, but I don't waste time
Boo, pink face really, so blue
Oo, stuntin' blue ocean, room views
Oo, swarovski Jimmy Choo shoes
Yeah, I mass the wavy like a navy boat cruise
I'm so fancy
Please don't touch me
I'm fashionably late, so please don't rush me

[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I said baby, I do this, I thought that, you knew this
Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, each beat dear, departed
Swagger on stupid, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that
I be that I-G-G-Y, put my name in bold
I been working, I'm up in here with some change to throw

[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge: Charli XCX]
Trash the hotel, let's get drunk on the minibar
Make the phone call, feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah Iâ€™m deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, ow!

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at it, I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
You so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down nothing
Slayin' these hoes, gold trigger on the gun like

[Hook: Charli XCX]
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane, from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow-oh-oh-oh

[Outro: Iggy Azalea & (Charli XCX)]
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
That do that, do that, I-G-G-Y
Who that, who that? I-G-G-Y
(Blow-oh-oh-oh)
