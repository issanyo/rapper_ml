[Lil' Kim]
Yeah, this goes out, to that dude
Yeah, you know w me hit the pavement
You bright up my life baby, you my Las Vegas
My sunshine on my rainy days (rainy days)
A little love from you take the pain away (pain away)
When I'm feeling stressed out, depressed, without a doubt
On my worst days, you bring the best out
Even when we break up, that's for the make up
Sex be the best, for days we be laid up
He even cook me breakfast on 'a wake up
I swear it's like a fairytale made-up
Bonnie & Clyde, noone can separate us
And we gon' ride out til' the feds come take us (yeah, yeah)
My King, I'm his Queen, 1st Lady
Us against the world, just me and my baby

[Alicia Keys]
You & me together, through the days and nights
I don't worry cos' everythings gonna be all right
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be all right
No one, no one, no one, can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one, can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know, some people search the world
To find, something like what we have
I know, people will try, try to divide something so real
So til' the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one
No one, no one, can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one, can get in the way of what I feel for you
