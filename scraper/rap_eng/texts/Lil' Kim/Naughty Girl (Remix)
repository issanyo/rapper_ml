[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
This is ladies night, once again it's on!
Ya man actin' up? Then leave him home!
It's the girl the industry call the rap Madonna
More dangerous than a tank full of piranhas
Courvoisier in my left arm, glass in my other hand
While I rock that coochie like a rubber band
I'm feelin' sexy in my million dollar Vicki bra
Ay yo Beyonce, how you feelin' ma?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
I'm feelin' sexy, I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me, you can feel my buring flame
(I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y, I just wanna take you home with me)
Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feelin' been comin' over me, I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to party

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
You're so sexy, tonight I am all yours, boy
The way your body, moves across the floor!
(I'm feelin' kinda N-A-S-T-Y, I juss wanna take you home with me)
Baby, the minute I feel your energy, the vibe is just taking over me (Ahhhhhhhhh) I start feelin' so crazy, babe
Lately, I feelin' been comin' over me, I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm got me feelin' so crazy, babe

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to party

[Break: Beyoncé]
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
You know I, rep the stuy when I chef the pie
I'm back in the kitchen with the flame on high
I see you lookin', baby whats cookin?
Yeah, I'm lookin' like something to eat
Your man there lookin' like something to freak
Lickin' on his lips like I'm somethin' sweet
Lil' Kim and Beyonce just tryin to keep the flame lit
And warm it up like Big Daddy Kane did

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl (Uhhhhhhhh)
I'm callin' all my girls
We gon' turn this party out, I know you want my body
Tonight, I'll be your naughty girl
Like, callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down, and I came to party
