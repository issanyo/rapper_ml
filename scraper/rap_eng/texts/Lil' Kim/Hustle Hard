[Intro: Lil' Kim, (Big Mike)]
(Oh shit) Another day another dollar my homie
(It's that Hustle Hard right here man)
It already snow, you know how it go (it's cold outside)
Same old shit, just a different day
I feel the Aftermath, Em' and Dre

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Same old shit, just different toilet
It is what it is, sometimes I can't call it
I need another house, another coupe
I'm tryna buy a' island, so guess what I'ma do
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Closed mouth, don't get fed on this boulevard

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Million dollar deposit
Half a mil' in my closet
Phantom milky white chocolate
If the roof is on then I chop it
S1 on my finger
On the steering wheel of that Beemer
I just bought the new M6, while they customised my GINA
Kimmy pull up at your party, Maybachs and Ferraris
Ducatis and Harleys, pink seats in Bugattis
Don't nothin' move 'til I say so
We all about them pesos
I.R.S. nigga we the mob
We hustle hard, cocaine dough
That Mercedes topless, ain't that bitch exotic
My men just bought me that white rose and I ain't talkin' flowers
I supplied, you worse
What you worried 'bout what I'm earning?
Money I keep burning
As the world keep turning

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Same old shit, just different toilet
It is what it is, sometimes I can't call it
I need another house, another coupe
I'm tryna buy a' island, so guess what I'ma do
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle hard
Closed mouth, don't get fed on this boulevard
