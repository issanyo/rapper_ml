[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Lil' Kim]
Never a flaw
A different kind of high
Ya know, feel me on this, huh, uh

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Ladies and gents, your dopest host presents extravagance
In the lady frame
Leavin' cum stains, niggas remain in awe
When I brought a Derringer, throw it to ya jaw, uh
Never a flaw
Never before have you seen such magnificence in the black princess, yes
Flow's phenom, I'm the bomb-diggity, ask Biggie
Keep a dedicated squad with me, call us the Gabbana girls
We dangerous, bitches pay a fee just to hang with us
Trust, niggas lust
Without a bank account, I doubt we could swing that route
Feel me out, uh, I'm used ta’
Hangin’ with boosters, in the best name brand
With the insane clan
Man, listen
My position is lieutenant
Like a block of hash, got the burners up in it, percent it
I send it back to ya’ greasy
Freak it Arabic style, Sharmoota elhas teeze
To please me you got to be well off
Bust a shell off, with a tattoo that starts off

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya’?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, you're drugs, baby
Damn ma', I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya’?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, you're drugs, baby

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Uh, to my niggas that trick a little
To my bitches that suck dick a little
While they niggas lick the middle
I'm the Don, y'all
High driven Jean-Paul Gaultier wear
Yeah, enough glorifyin'
Lyrically electrifyin'
Bitches be lyin' bout the clothes they be buyin'
Some stores won't even let you whores in
'Til I begin to embarrass that ass and get crass
Kim surpass all crews
Bitches still drinkin' booze
I sip Cristal and Landcruise
Receive all the “ooohs” and the “ahhhs”, the jewels and the cars
Slick nigga, I'm stickin' you, Baby Pah, uh
Yes indeed, flows first class and yours is coach like the bag
The Prada mama
Jog five miles a day, then I hit the sauna
My girls rock Chanel and smoke mad marijuana

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, you're drugs, baby
Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya’?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, uh, drugs, baby

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
Inhale this, clench your fist
Then ya’, feel the mist through the uterus
Can ya’, picture this?
Life without me, wake up you're having bad dreams
Cause ya’ fiend for a toke
My crew tote Tocques and mink coats
On the cell with the boat
What you thought?
We get caught and get bailed out?
Fuck the jailhouse, Hennessy on the rocks is all we got as we sail out
Entrepreneurs, Cristal pourers, be glad we ain't takin' yours
Boring, huh? I'm warnin' ya’
Style waits for no bitch, I dream rich
When I fuck with scratch and sniff
Now I stacks the shit, practice it
So no bitch can tax the shit, miraculous
So I can relax a bit, and get my toes licked
The drugs nigga, a-hah hah hah!

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya’?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, you're drugs, baby
Damn ma’, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya’?
All I wanna do is touch ya’
The ultimate rush, you're drugs, baby
