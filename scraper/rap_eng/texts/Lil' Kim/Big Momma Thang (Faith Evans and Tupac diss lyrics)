[Lil Kim]
Yeah, wha' wha'
You got it going on, wha' wha'
Uh, wha' wha, you got it going on, wha' wha'
Yeah, wha wha', you got it going on, wha' wha'
I used to be scared of the dick, now I throw lips to the shit
Handle it like a real bitch
Heather Hunter, Janet-Jac-me, take it in the butt, yazz yazz what
I got land in Switzerland, even got sand in the Marylands
Bahamas in the spring, baby it's a big mama thing
Can't tell by the diamonds in my rings?
That's how many times I wanna cum, 21
And another one, and another and another one
24 Carats nigga, that's when I'm fucking with the average nigga
Work the shaft, brothers be battin' me
And oh, don't you like the way I roll
And play with my bushy, tell me what's on your mind when the tounge's in the pussy
Is marriage?(Damn this bitch is bad) Baby carriage?(Damn I love that)
Shit no, on the dime shit is mine
Got to keep em' cummin all the time, why

(Chorus)
Killahs be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk tough walk that shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B but ya can't be
Thats why you're mad at me x2

Hoes think I'm foul, well call me the bitch shitter, the lyrical, gonna take a miracle
Like Deniece Willams bitches get peeled
By the 6 shotta, guns we got alotta, you can't-a do me not-a
Want it raw dog, well you best-a see papa
Get your titties wet, and wouldn't it be glorious if you give head to Notorious
Then sex my crew
You just a wanna be down with my clique bitch
Just some dick sucking, ready for an ass fucking
Let me stress, the tattoos on your breast
B.I.G, you rocking my property
P.Y.P, play your position
Now I got you wishing, you never started dissing
Plus I give head better than you, my pussy get wetter than you, fuck better than you
I dedicate this song to ya, like R. Kelly and them twin Pac's in your belly

(Chorus)
Killahs be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk tough walk that shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B but ya can't be
Thats why you're mad at me x2

Sore nigga what, pussy greased up, stack the g's up keeps the knees up
What the fuck
Stay feelin' half millin', Gineva Diva, yeah I throws it down
Make it round clown, the clock stops for no one
Never 68 and owe one, takes one to know one
Better off with the Playboy magazine, uh fucking with the Don
Push keys, these three for takes
Yeah I ride crates, state to state, ten it takes
Mad dimes, from New York to Anaheim
While daydream and whine, I just keep getting mine
And I, and I'm married to this
Y'all strategy bliss, and still planning weddings
Mafi also dead ends the bullshit, any type that threatens to pull shit
Uh, oh yeah who shot ya, who knows but they gotcha
Fed up,(uh)wet up, maybe next time ya punk ass I'll keep your head up

(Chorus)
Killahs be quiet, my niggas bring the riots
Tough talk tough walk that shit is tired
You wanna be this Queen B but ya can't be
Thats why ya mad at me x6
