(intro)
Uh, shout out to the Queen Bee
Lil Kim. She the baddest bitch ever!

Picy. Yep
My lyrics are always spicy. Bitch you need to take a seat!
I never talk about drugs in my songs
I don’t rap about smoking bongs
I don’t always sexualise women and men. But then
They’ll say my song “The way you are” is sexual, it is
At least its not about hoes and cars! I got mad bars
Thats just one of 2 songs!
You know my EP is spicy, its hotter than Nando’s
You know my flow is awesome
I’m stepping in hotter this year
They ain’t gonna like it
Because I’m so spicy. yeah!
I’m stepping in hotter this year
They ain’t gonna like it
Because I’m so spicy. (Uh, ok)
I’m stepping in hotter this year bitch!
Sing it Kim!

(Hook 2: Lil' Kim)
Pull up in the dawn, spicy
250 on the arm, spicy
They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy
When Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy

(Verse 2: Lil' Kim)
Shit's real, he got ADD, Kim make him sit still
He wanna know how these billion dollar lips feel
I'm too classy, too bossy
You bitches ain't spicy, y'all just salty
Pull up with the draco in the trunk, call it Aubrey
Kimmy got the spice, hold the keys to ya life
And you bitches couldn't Xscape with T.I's wife
I'm so spicy

(Hook 2: Lil' Kim)
Pull up in the dawn, spicy
250 on the arm, spicy
They hate me, I see why, I'm so icy
When Kim come through, they get spicy
You know my niggas be, spicy
And all my bitches be, spicy
Red Birkin, red bottoms so spicy
The team lit, everythin' we do spicy
