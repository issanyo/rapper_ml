[ntro: Lil' Kim]
I need you, got to have you
Yeah, whatever

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim & (Mario Winans)]
I was sitting at the bar
When this real horny guy came over
(Hi how are you doing? How are you?)
He said won't you let me take you
On a ride in my Range Rover
I said you can't be serious
My Bentley's right outside
Plus your breath smells like shit anyway

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Oh, I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim & (Mario Winans)]
Everybody's on the dance floor
And this fool is still behind me
I am dipping through the crowd now
Hoping that he doesn't find me
He said, baby, where you going?
(Lil' Kim I love you)
Then he grabbed me by the hand
And dipped my body to the ground
And said

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Oh, I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now

[Bridge: Lil' Kim]
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Dut-dut-dut-dut
Dut-dut-dut-dut
Dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
See the party don't stop 'til the casket drop
Like a six double O with the plastic drop
Damn is that all you got?
Hmm, baby, give it one more shot
Got a body like what-what
Watch me shake my butt, butt-butt
Like it when you sing that song, oh
I know you wanna see my thong

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
Oh, I need you, oh
Gotta have you, oh
Just wanna touch you, oh
I need your love, yeah
Right now

[Outro: Mario Winans]
Right now, right now
I need your love, baby
I need your love, baby
