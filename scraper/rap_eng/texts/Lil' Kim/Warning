All these bitches is my pets

Bitches try to bite, take their ass to the vet
Put em right to sleep like they popped a Xanax

I swipe ya whole life with my debit card

Shitted on ‘em
I’m just pissin’ on ‘em
Spittin’ on ‘em
Put ya middle fingers in the air if you did it on ‘em
Shitted on ‘em
I’m just pissin’ on ‘em
Spittin’ on ‘em
Put ya middle fingers in the air if you did it on ‘em
