[Intro]
It's Britney, bitch
And Lil' Kim, hoe

[Verse 1, Lil Kim]
Kimme, kimme more
Cause too much is not enough
All this liquor in my cup
Got me dancing like a slut
Fans are screaming Kimme more
Cause too much is not enough
Can you feel the adrenaline rush
Kim and Brit, all eyes on us
(All eyes on us)

[Verse 2, Britney Spears]
Every time they turn the lights down
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
(Give it to me, give it to me)
Public display of affection
(What, what, what?)
Feels like no one else in the room
(But you)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (We keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin' (We keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin'
While we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
Keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin'

[Chorus] x4
Kimme, Kimme more
(Kimme, what?)
Kimme more
Kimme, Kimme, more
(Kimme what?)

[Verse 3, Britney Spears]
Center of attention, (that's us)
Even when we're up against the wall, ha,ha, ha
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission, yeah
You got my permission, oh
(Lil' Kim and Britney Spears)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can get down
Like there's no one around
We keep on rockin' (We keep on rockin')
We keep on rockin' rockin' (We keep on rockin')
Cameras are flashin'
While we?re dirty dancin'
They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
Keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin?

[Chorus] x4
Kimme, Kimme more
(Kimme, what?)
Kimme more
Kimme, Kimme, more
(Kimme what?)

[Verse 4, Lil Kim]
It started as a dirty dance
And it led to a one night stand
Damn, I'm hookin' up with a fan
Tell you what, we freakin' with this video cam
I'm such a dirty whore
Shake your body till it's sore
Everybody hit the floor
Feelin' hot and sexy
(Lil' Kim and Britney Spears)
Got 'em sayin', sayin'
(Let's go)

[Chorus] x5
Kimme, Kimme more
(Kimme, what?)
Kimme more
Kimme, Kimme, more
(Kimme what?)

[Outro]
Bet you didn't see this one comin?
The incredible Lygo
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
Bet you didn't see this one comin?

And the unstoppable, Danja
Lil' Kim and Britney, yeah
Ha, you gonna have to remove me
