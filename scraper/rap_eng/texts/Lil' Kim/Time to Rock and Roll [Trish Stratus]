[Intro: Lil' Kim]
Hahaha
I don't care what yall say

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Kim]
(Whoa) It's time to rock and roll
(Whoa) This time I'm in control
(Whoa) Right now I own the streets
I got the keys to the city
That's cause I get down

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
Sometimes I wonder, how I made it far
With all these people hatin' on me, y'all know who you are
Take a chance and try to come up, in this game bein' a star
Now I own the keys to a brand new fancy car, baby
It's my turn to burn, and now I'm here to rub it in ya face (Hahahaha)
When will you learn, I'm the Queen and I'll put you in your place

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Bounce.., Bounce..., Bounce..
How dare you try to go aganist the glorious hon
I'll slaughter you son, it's over, the story is done
You can be number two, but I'm second to none
What you forgot Queen Bee's the notorious one, uh

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm cream del la cream, so you can never play me
See I'm more than a lady
I'm more than a lover, more than enough for ya
Please try understand me
I'ma stay at the top, cause I don't give a damn

I don't care what y'all say, I'ma keep doin me
Y'all can't fade me

[Chorus to fade]
