[Iconz]{Lil' Kim}
If you smoke weed now {uh}
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown {uh huh}

When see ?stable? cloudy scenary
I'm high off greenery
It could be in a VIP sippin' Hennessey
With the trick rollin' exstacy
Y'all know how these Iconz roll, Iconz flow
Drop the system, stay hot like whoa
We sure y'all know how we puttin' it down
Iconz in the house I'mma shut shit down!

Yeah, shut the shit down
Time to switch now
Crys in the glass to sip now
X5, superstar, the Icon mamma
Stepped out, tanked out and let's dada

For all my girls who be shakin' they ass
Spendin' the cash, y'all keep sippin' on now, wha (hey)

(Chorus)
[Iconz]{Lil' Kim}

Got a drink that you can't put down {uh huh}
When a fight, will the shit go down {uh, uh, the REMIX}

[Lil' Kim]
Everybody talk fly, but ain't go no plane
See me at the front row at the Knick's game
Fuck smoking blunts, I take bones to the brain
BLOAW! Nig, I got a good-ass aim
Nobody get rich without me, now or never
Whatever, you niggas need to get it together
Icon, Queen Bee, so respect the game
This shit right here made off the chain
I'm just a fly girl
Always rocking thongs with the see-through stockings
Gators with the Lizzies
Burners for the dead beats
WHA?! Mafia, yeah we comin for all, comin for y'all
That's right, I got something for y'all
What you drinkin'? Me? I'm drunk off Bacardi
Oh shit, let's crunk up the party
From New York on the way to Miami
Everybody get fucked up, break it down now, BLOAW!

(Chorus)
[Iconz]
If you smoke weed now (come on)
In this bitch hit you all wanna clown
Got a drink that you can't put down
When a fight, will the shit go down
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up, niggas)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)
Get fucked up, (get fucked up)

With sexy hoes flexin' thong
Got five pounds of jewels round my neck and arm (huh!)
