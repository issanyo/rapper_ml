Lil' Kim:

Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Biggs

Chorus (112)

Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

Ronald Isley:

Can't get you off of my mind
Girl I've been thinking of you
So lets not waste our time
Tell me what you want to do
Your body's hot for mine
Girl let me hold you real tight
Don't rush lets take our time
I wanna love you all night

Angela Winbush:

You know just what to do
Go down and taste my love
I'll do the same for you
You know what I'm thinking of
Tonight I'm gonna cry
Until I'm soaking wet
Do every thing you like
Baby comfort me

Chorus (112)

Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

Ronald Isley:

Don't wanna stop this groove
Just wanna keep goin on
The way your body moves
Oh girl I can't let you go
Just let me come inside
Until you can't take no more
You're body wrapped on mine
Now baby, let me explode

Angela Winbush:

You gotta give me some more
I love the way it feels
The way you caress me
Take me to ecstasy
Oh baby up and down
Just hit it all around
This love it feels so right
Bring it hold me too

Lil' Kim:

Lil' Kim, you don't know what type of chick this is
Number one ballette of the mistresses
Mr. Biggs you know you got to keep me jigs
Even though it might mean stealing chips from kids (say what!)
You know I sail the coast too hot for mink coats
Get C-notes every time I deep throats
Ya losing it, acting like ya new to this
Get true to this, make it shift in my uterus
Sexing in the Aston Martin, when wifey comes home
Get the dough and I'm departing
I wanna see if you can make me scream I hate ya
Give me back shots so I can sweat out my cream of nature

(112)

Don't you stop
You turn me on I need release, whoa
Love me here, touch me there
Something to share

Chorus (112)

Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)
Float on, float on, float on, float on
(Don't you know I want your love, don't you know I need your love)

Lil' Kim:

Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Biggs, you know you got to keep me jigs
Mr. Biggs
(again with chorus and ad libs)
