[Intro]
(Slaphouse live)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm a trendsetter
I do what I want, I do what I like
I know you hate, you don't
Why you hatin' though?
Not good for your health
You mad that I'm up
Be mad at yourself

[Hook]
I'm trendin'
I'm settin' trends
Bitch, I'm settin' trends
I'm trendin'
I'm settin' trends
Bitch, I'm settin' trends

[Verse 1]
I'm trendin'
Aye, pushin' that Bentley like strollers
Yeah, holdin' the cup like coaster, roller
Yeah, poppin' this like I'm suppose to
All designer, baller, not payin' no coaches
Rate the focus
You haters is like cock-a-roaches
Hard to approach us
My necklace is gold dust
Boy, these Giuseppe's cost more
Than your note on your foreign
Me, just ballin'
Givenchy, my shirt and my shoes
And my bag and my wallet is blue, oooh

[Pre-Hook]
Trendsetter
I do what I want, I do what I like

Not good for your health
You mad that I'm up
Be mad at yourself

[Hook]
I'm trendin'
I'm settin' trends
Bitch, I'm settin' trends
I'm trendin'
I'm settin' trends
Bitch, I'm settin' trends

[Verse 2]
My scent is that Dolce, my scarf is Versace
It's by Donatella, my ring is the same
My skin is Nutella, it's vintage Chanel
All over my frame, judge is my game
My nigga, he eating me, I know he need an umbrella
Adventurous fella
He's going down, down underneath
Just like a cellar
My sneakers are Maison Margiela (what else?)
Countin' up like a bank teller (what else?)
Show me one bitch who do realer
Always catch me with gorillas
Pockets on sumo, no sit-ups
On my pussy he do chin-ups
Blanco, I'm raisin' the bar
Better high jump like Olympics

[Bridge]
(Aye, I'm settin' trends)
I'm trendin' (aye)
No album, no single (aye)
Just ya girl (settin' trend)

[Pre-Hook]
I'm a trendsetter
I do what I want, I do what I like
I know you hate, you don't
Why you hatin' though?
Not good for your health
You mad that I'm up
Be mad at yourself

[Hook]
I'm trendin'
I'm settin' trends
Bitch, I'm settin' trends

[Outro: Diddy]
Ay, ay, so you mean to tell me

'Cause, 'cause we fly, nigga?
Fuck you mean, nigga?
