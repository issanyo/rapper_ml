It's queen bee, sex in the citay
Representin' up top
Brought da block wit meh
Custom Versace dress
Showin one tittay
In Brook-lawn, New York
Grinding and grittay
BenZ's to bentl-
Oh, no
Lick the TV slow
I show em' thangs they neva seen before
Cause the way I move is so flexible
I'll try anything
I'm a try-sexual
Dem blindfolds and handcuffs
I get rough
With my thighs wrapped around his head
Like earmuffs
Doin freaky weird stuff
Talk tough
Face down
Steppin to the queen with the diamond lace crown
Jewel of the nile
I'm romancin' the stone
I said, look bitch
I got cha man on the phone
But you could swing through if you want a peep show
Just bring a hundred grand and some weed to keep roll

Ref
Speak the wrong words bitch
And you will get touched
This time around it ain't like before
Speak the wrong words bitch
And you will get touched
This time around I'm gon crack ya jaw
Speak the wrong words bitch
And you will get touched
Spit the shank out my mouth

And bust you down
Speak the wrong words bitch
And you will get touched
Biggie left me the court
Now I'm holdin it down

I'm a superfreak
I'm superfreaky, yo
And no I won't lick
So give it to me now
Miss Prada, and Chanel, Gucci as hell
Vous les vous coucher
Wit dis mademoiselle
I sell sex high price
The rap Heidi Fleiss
Iceberg jeans
Dat ass looks mighty nice
This is the fabulous life of Kim Jones
I got chinchilla covers on my flip phones
To match with dem furs
Baby got back
Wit dem curves
Her female MAC wit makeup
On my verbs
Flow, mascara, and blush
Take that monkey shit off
You embarrassin' us!
Comparison
What?!? Ain't nobody close to me
I'm up top right where I'm supposed to be
And now haters all kiss my bikini wax
And if you seen The Catch
You know da Queen is back
