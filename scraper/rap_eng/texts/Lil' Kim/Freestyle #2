Mmm, mmm-mmm
Check it out, the Queen Bee
That's me
My man Flex, he's up next
Yeah, check it out
Hey, yo Flex
There's a lot of mufuckers out here that wanna be like us... real bad
But we got to show them who's on top
Nuhmean?
Uh, check it out, uh
Fellow bitches, adapt to any rebel wishes
Check it out, the Queen Bee
Lil' Kim, Yeah
That's right
Lil' Kim in the house
Check it out
Wit my man, Flex
Uh

Sometime a gal can get couth, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Ain't that the truth?
Frontin like they bulletproof
And those with no couth
Get thrown off the roof, like Bishop with the Juice
Part-nah, let your noose loose
Bitches got the audac-ity
Tryin to say they gettin cash like me, get ass like me
You couldn't be as classy as me
Even if you roll a Eva curtain
And diamonds on the surface it just defeats the purpose
Ho, I'mma double bitch
I lick dicks sometimes for the hell of it
Who stack chips like computers never celibate
Stash weed in Bermuda
Look around, look around, the room's empty
So, I guess that be me
The Queen B, Double E
I keep my foes close
Like I used to chop my hoes close
But this cat named Gicanno's
Who used to call me bag lady
Cause if you lick me from my
Index finger to the thumb, it shouldn't stay numb
See, I live this life, you wish this life
Dream this life, of royals
Motherfuckers got you gas motor spoiled
So what you gonna do when you run out of oil?
Crumble like the foil

This goes out to you
Sealed with a kiss, the Queenuesche
Uh, yeah, check it out
Me and my man Flex; we just doin this shit
That's why I'm up next, you know what I'm sayin?
We been there
