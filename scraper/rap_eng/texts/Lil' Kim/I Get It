[Verse]
The bank don't stop cause they put me in cuffs
Still made money up in the can, what the fuck
I'd have a baby by you, baby, if you a billionaire
Write the check before I cum, just sign right here
I'm gon' stay rich
I ain't gon' die tryin' to spend my shit
I'mma die tryna spend your shit
Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen Bee gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amatuer shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick? She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being Conceited, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeeeeeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceilin'
I get it, the lifestyle that you only rap about
I live it, my man buy cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like a Phatom, you a Honda Civic
Lil' Kim got your whole bank stopped, I get it
