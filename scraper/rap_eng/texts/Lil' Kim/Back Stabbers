[Intro: Jimmy Cozier]
Smile in your face
Yeaaah
Back stabbers

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
The buddha got my brain seein' my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin' my remains, it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat, now she ain't there
I'm seein' bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find, see
A little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch wanna choke me 'til I bleed
Now watch a bitch breathe from dum-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect, now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he want my cash
The Lexus and Range, give her sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad and they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a cream, you know
Fuck the hoes, bitches is detrimental, the guns is essential

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I'm havin' re-occurrin' dreams, bitches they want my cream
They wanna be lieutenant so it seems, I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin' round and round my bed
The shadow stops, points a Glock to my fuckin' head
I grab my pillow, crack the back window
Pull out the tre-8, bust three times at the gate
Lord, have mercy, the devil tryin' to curse me
I keeps seeing shit that wasn't there in the first
See bitches be livin' mad foul, they fuck my man
Steal out my crib, then come and try and shake my hand
Yeah man, breakin' you down one time
I packs that shit for your ass, chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you bitches
I wish you keep your mind off my motherfuckin' riches
Bitches, I'm tired of all you hoes beggin' me for clothes
Bank rolls is all I knows, that shit is dead chicken head

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
The morning's finally here, damn, what should I wear?
Time to get dressed and do my hair, once again it's on
Somebody's knockin' at my door, but when I walk across the floor
To scope it out, the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearin' voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my tool, cause this fool might get outta line
I guess, it's time to test, this bullet-proof dress
From puttin' holes up in my chest
I'm lookin' through the peep-hole to recognize the face
I see three bitches and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy, but when I open the door
Three little girls sellin' candy, ya see bitches is jealous of Lil' Kim
Because my clique is thicker than the rest of them
All I wanna do is be rich and stay that bitch
Clock dough on the low, you know?

[Chorus: Jimmy Cozier]
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
Baaaaaack (back stabbers)
Smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
They smile in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
The back stabbers (back stabbers)
