Blaow! Tadow! Watch out now, uh-huh

Got trees roll it up, you a G throw it up
Nigga slipped me his number on the low - I tore it up
Oh wait a minute they playin my shit, slow it up
What, you outta Cris? Fuck it, Mo' it up
Y'all just rookies, poppin on the scene
Be careful how y'all talk cause we pop them things
Y'all should see us on the TV, rappin and actin
Yup uh-huh look a little closer
Yeah, that's us in the Millennium Testarossa
People takin pictures, blowin our cover
Paparazzi gonna get you one way or another
Hey wait a minute ain't that Brandy's brother?
Straight from the Eastside, and that's how I ride
Here's another one; Ray J, tell 'em where you from

[Verse 4: Ray J]
I'm from the land of women
Sunny days chrome spinnin
Juice and ginin
It's on tonight
If you feel you're another one
Representin where you from
Sex you're gettin some
It's on tonight

[Hook: Pharrell + (Ray J)]
Oh Wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
Girl wait a minute
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute)
Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute hey hey)
