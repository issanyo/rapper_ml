[Hook]
I-I look like money
I smell like money
I talk money money
My girl got money
I look like money
I smell like money
I talk money money
My girl got money

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Cash money that's so last year
Now when I do a show they gotta pay me in gold
You talking bout bread? Gotta pay me the loafs
Be sipping on Rose we making a toast
Celebrate to the good life
I'm married to the money, I'm a good wife
Hundred grand for a show that's a good night
What it look like? What it smell like?
(Money, money)
I'm smelling like I'm fresh out the bank
Y'all ain't getting money? Oh y'all can't relate
Kimmy go hard in the motherfucking paint
I'm dunking on you hoes like Blake
Let's separate the real from the fake
The workers from the bosses, most the nice stones
Turn them diamonds that's flawless
I'm a winner, I ain't good at taking losses
And we don't fuck with 911 that's just the cautious

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Yeah
See me looking like a hundred bill
Like Lewinsky I'm trying to blow a Bill
50 grand in that Hermes bag
Cause reptile like all you snakes in the grass
They like "Girl you be killing 'em!"
No longer single, I just married Benjamins
So tell a friend to tell a friend that it's Kim again
Yeah the queen is back and I'm bout to finish 'em
Yeah my attitude like fuck it
Show game rough more than your whole budget
You already know it's the best that ever done this
So them other hoes they can pack it up like luggage
Smell like money, talk like money
VVSs that'd make a rainy day sunny
Little Kim the goddess, Playboy bunny
And we do the money dance like niggas do the doggie yeeeeah!
