[Intro: Kiely]
Haha, 3LDub baby, A Girl Can Mack

[Verse 1: Kiely]
Yo, if you don't like expensive things
Then you can bounce if you don't wanna get it together
You could be out, 'cause I'm all about gettin' them things
From the truck to the house, to the gear and them rings
No doubt, coulda done it but ain't no hoe for you
Now I try to tell you but all you do is sit around
It takes more than hope and a dream
I got a mean team puttin' in work to get the cream, what

[Chorus: Lil' Kim (3LW)]
Money and hot rides (I need that)
The platinum and shine (I need that)
The house and the gear (I need that)
I'm sayin' baby (I... want... that...)

[Verse 2: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Life can turn you in so many different directions
Then I got a mind to win
(Can't remember why I got with you)
I want everything, but I need to stay realistic
I'm gonna live this dream
(From hear on out, that's what I'm about)

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Boy I feel for you, you think you have it real easy
You don't even have a clue
(Can't remember why I got with you)
I'm gonna do my thang, sorry if you feel rejected
You need to do the same
(From here on out, that's what I'm about)

[Bridge: 3LW (Lil' Kim)]
I need these things, you can't supply me
It's too easy, for you to stop tryin' (Uh-huh)
Get off your feet, do it for yourself (Let's do it)
I can't stick around with shady feelings
(Lil' Kim, Queen Bee, 3LW)

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
Jackpot, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at, where the stash at
Nigga pass that, up the bonds and stocks
And the canary yellow D flawless rocks
Introducing the Lil' Kim Chopard Watch
I'm on fire, 'bout to turn it up a notch
Keep ya yacht, I want ships inside my estate
With FullForce written on the license plate
Heliports and helicopters with gold propellers
Tryna have more cheese then mozzarella
I need stables, there's only one way to live (What's that?)
Horseback ridin' in the back of the crib
Two Indian braids like the Navaho
Yippi iy ya, yippi iy yo
Make this money, take this money
Ain't no way you gonna take this from me, ow

[Chorus 2x]

[Breakdown: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Uh-huh, (I... want... that...)
If you don't want that baby, then you can't have me baby
Don't depend on me baby, finally do ya own thing baby
Ooh (I need that)
Ooh (I need that)
Ooh
(I want that, want that, I want, I want that
Want that, get that, I want that
Get that, got that, I want that
I want that, want that, I want, I want that)

[Chorus 2x]

[Outro Lil' Kim (Kiely)]
(Uh-huh) 3LW (I... want... that... uh-huh)
Get on ya feet boi
