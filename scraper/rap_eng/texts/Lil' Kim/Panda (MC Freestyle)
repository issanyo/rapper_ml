[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Nicki Minaj, let's go

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Aye yo, CiCi
Let me show you how to do a singing bitch greasy
You was by Lenox, yeah, the one on Peachtree
I was with Dimitri
Seen you on your Love & Hip Hop, Mendecees
"F-f-f-fuck these petty niggas" is a bitch motto
If I say it on wax, every bitch follow
If I'm sipping in the club, Myx Moscato
I got a big fat ass, big dicks follow
Hit them with the back shots, hit them with the ass shots
Take them to the bank then I hit them with the cash drops
I do it big, I hit them with the caps lock
I'm gonna ball, I hit them with the mascot
No, I never been there, but I like to Bangkok
Big fat titties when they hanging out my tank top
Huh, you gon' play me? On Instagram, niggas trying to shade me
But your bitch at home trying to play me, I'm Nicki M Weezy F, baby
Man, fuck you and your lady, gun butt you, 'cause you're shady
Now which bitch want it, cause that bitch get it
I gave him to you, bitch, don't fucking forget it

[Bridge: Lady Leshurr]
Unleshed!
I'm not the one to call
When you're in danger
I'm not the one to call
Cause you're a stranger
I'm not the one to call
When you're in danger
Cause you're a stranger

[Verse 2: Lady Leshurr]
First off, shut your gob
Don't be mad cause I took the spot
Why you so concerned about me
When your mouthpiece looks like a crusty cob?
You must be dumb
If you're number 2, I must be 1
Becah gyal will get beat like rapompom
So don't big up your chest in your wonder bra
You battyfish
Wagwan, what's happening?
When I was in the lab, just cookin' up
You were somewhere in the club daggering
Man, I'm savaging
Done with the talk, through, javelin
Yeah, I might have big teeth on a rabbit ting
But I'm still here, and I'm still managing
And you're where? Look - panicking!
I don't care! Shrug, ain't havin' it
My whole year's booked, travelling
You're nowhere, stuck, stammering
You see me, shook, MC Hammering
Gone, left the room
Get P money, just check the views
Don't know who you're stepping to
Cause I'm ahead, I'm not next to you
Kill 'em all dead, I'll execute
Get them cross, so I'm X-ing you
I'm at the top, now I'm vexing you
I am your mom, you're my second yout'
You're my second yout', man
I called you Miranda

[Bridge: Lil Mama]
???????

[Verse 3: Lil Mama]
???????

[Bridge: Lil Kim]
I know they see us coming
I know they see us coming
Ayo Desiigner!
We see you baby
Welcome to the Royal Brooklyn Family
I ain't came to play, I came to slay

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
I got killas in Belize
I got niggas in the league
NBA, NHL, MLB
Watch how I go off on the Hennessy
NFL no sacks
I got the ball like a running back
My nigga OT with a hundred packs
I hit the mall with a hundred racks
Two straps like a back pack
Rolls Royce and a Maybach
Back to Back like a Drake rap
Drive the Rari like I'm on a race track
White kicks Buscemi
Black Whip Borghini
Back on top like a beanie
Eat the booty like zucchini
He pulled it out, it was teeny
Pour some ketchup on that weenie
My niggas pour lean in Bellinis
My pussy wet like a bikini
Getting cheese, fettuccine
Move and work out the deli
Move my body like a genie
Disapper, Makaveli
