[Tanya Speaking to Lil' Kim]
Yow little kim you dun kno you're the original queen bee
Ah wha we say is a gangsta thing
Tanya Stephens from Jamaica
Wha you waan we do
A wha you mean
Ah murda we haffi murda some pussy hole
Yuh dun kno (yea)
Blood clat.. a wha dat (check, check, check.. mm)

[Lil' Kim :Verse 1]
My poppa taught me how to ride dicks
Cut em off, freeze 'em, and use 'em as ice picks (yea, yea)
Hard times baby
Got bitches upstate doing 2-8
For first degree rape
But I can't get uptake
My name hold weight (wha you seh)
Like I said my name hold weight (dun kno)
Pussy is the bait (dun kno)
Around the way they call me the pink panther
Ask Leon Ganther, (haha bout)
Haha, he know
The rap Josephine Baker
Keep her wrist looking like strobe lights
When I bust my gun, niggas think I'm babylon (fer real)
Cause my rocks shine on jus' like dey sygon (boc boc boc boc..dun kno)
Deceptive cons
Deceptive nets
Fuck it
Who you with
Betta claim your sect
Caution walkin' on me might break your neck
I'm like water on the floor slippery when wet (for real)
Niggas wanna test me.. i doubt that
Automatic uzis, we about that (you dun kno!)
We gun you in the sun or the rain
Point blank range
Me and my bitch can squeeze about 6 (yea, yea)

[Hook: Tanya]
Last night i heard the screamin'
But it dont make no sense fi call the police (wah me seh)
Last night i head the shooting
But it dont make no sense fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight

[Lil' Kim :Verse 2]
I got lil kim dats
And fuck nigga hats
Where my bitches is at?
Where my bitches is at? (right here)
Be sure to tell them cats
To lick between ya laps
And when it's they turn, take a lil' nap
When dogs start barkin'
Throw they ass a snack
Pat 'em on they back
And that's that
It may sound rude
But I don't love you dudes
Tape you eatin' my pussy and throw you on the interlude (scene)
You think I give a fuck cause you paid for my food?
Put you out on the highway and make you strip nude, (hehe)
Then drive away in your car with your wallet
Thought I was sweet meat
Look what you done started [run dat]
You ain't know about the,"set it off queen bitch"
In the Porsche, license plate read,"filthy rich"
I spend money
Lend money
I play niggas with money
Matter fact I love money
And I never borrow
Even if the ones low
Cause if it cost ten, I give 'em 20 so I never owe (scene)
And other women can't stand the way I'm livin'
They not my problem
My main concern is Kim (is all about)

[Hook: Tanya]
Last night i heard the screamin'
But it dont make no sense, fi call the police (wah we seh)
Last night i heard the shooting
But it dont make no sense, fi call the police
Murda some bwoi ah go get tonight (murda! murda!)

[Lil' Kim :Verse 3]
As we pop the bub' up in the reggae club
DJ rock rub-a-dub jams by Beenie Man (scene)
Me sees P.Diddy and the fam
In the back by the rest rooms, shaking hands with the fans
Funny style cats bump us while we dance
You know a broke nigga always fucks up the plans
DJ switch the music to the Wu-tang clan
D-Rock hit himm in the face with the Saint Ives can
Security came through, broke it up, then he ran
Be back at the bar again
Laughin' and partyin'
Jerks showin off pullin 50s out they clothes (for real)
Please babe, bro we blow our nose with those ((you kno) dun kno)
Linen crushed out
Egyptian mushed out
Some boy lookin' shot in the party rushed out
My niggas, they surround me like the pope
You should've seen the shit, one big joke
And as usual, this cat with an afro
Snitchin' for no dough
Info to popo
Fuckin' dodo
Silly like the time I got you watched
I hate cowards
Ya'll suckas needa blow cock (for real {scene})
