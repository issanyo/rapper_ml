[Intro: Rupee]
Salaam Remi, Rupee, Lil' Kim, The Queen Bee, to the club, uh, to the club

[Verse 1: Rupee]
Outside inside the place it rammed, dancefloor tight but we don't give a damn
Man hold yuh gal, gal hold yuh man and
Do the damn thing, do the damn thing
Pop, that, Cris, no work tomorrow and you know I ain't drivin
Excuse, me, miss, tell me what's your name and tell me what your drinkin
No, sleep tonight, party goin on til six in the mornin
The dancefloor's tight
Yo! Just the way we like it everybody's jumpin

[Chorus: Rupee]
Get your freak on, do what you want, gal move your waist, give me a taste
Get your freak on, do what you want, mash up di place, give me a taste
