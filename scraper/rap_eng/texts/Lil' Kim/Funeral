[Intro: Lil' Kim]
Uh, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em

[Chorus: DreamDoll]
I'ma kill all you hoes
Funeral services
You was just talkin' out loud
Now you a nervous bitch
This that hoe get down
This that murder shit
Blood on my red bottoms
Don't get nervous, bitch

[Verse 1: DreamDoll]
Diamonds dancin', they toe woppin'
Danity Kane, I'm a show stopper
Lose what? To who?
I have to win, got no options
I got that little bitch mad
I put that bitch in her bag
I'ma pull up in a coupe
Bitch, you just hopped outta cab

[Chorus: DreamDoll]
I'ma kill all you hoes
Funeral services
You was just talkin' out loud
Now you a nervous bitch
This that hoe get down
This that murder shit
Blood on my red bottoms
Don't get nervous, bitch

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim and DreamDoll
That mean all ya' bitches dead
Never sleep on me
Like a bonnet I'm on all ya' bitches heads
Fucked your man then cut him off a week ago
I ain't never in my feelings, I ain't Kiki, hoe
Oh, you nervous now?
Don't get nervous now
It ain't workin' out
Plannin' your funeral service now
Dude say my pussy fantastic
So they give me their plastic
Why you think we live life in plastic?
We wrappin' bitches in plastic

[Chorus: DreamDoll]
I'ma kill all you hoes
Funeral services
You was just talkin' out loud
Now you a nervous bitch
This that hoe get down
This that murder shit
Blood on my red bottoms
Don't get nervous, bitch

[Outro: DreamDoll]
Don't get nervous, bitch
This that murder shit
(This that murder shit)
