[Intro: Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim and B2K
Now what they gon' say?
Now what you gon' do?
Do that thing, it's on you

[Verse 1]
Walked in the spot and I already picked one
My dinner for the night is to get one
Or two, or three
Five, six, seven if you leave it up to me
I'm down to get down wit cha
Wiggley, Jiggley, turn it all around would ya
Uhh ohh and let me give the money
Don't freeze be easy it's cool mommy

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go, do that thing for me
Let it go from, your head to your shoulders
Get a drink and come over
After that we go head to the Rover

[Chorus]
Back it up, clap it up
Switch it up, change it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me
Flip it up, give it up
I'ma grip it up while you rip it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me

[Verse 2]
Give me a minute want a swig of this pimp juice
I'ma be in it, when I'm in it there will be no use
For games, no games I don't need a lot
I got this on lock dog
You so down
The way you do it babe
Put ya back into babe, uhh ohhhh can I get it on
I got a lot in mine and that's about time

[Pre-Chorus]
There you go, do that thing for me
Let it go from, your head to your shoulders
Get a drink and come over
After that we go head to the Rover

[Chorus]
Back it up, clap it up
Switch it up, change it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me
Flip it up, give it up
I'ma grip it up while you rip it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me

[Bridge]
Say Yo Yo, Say Yo Yo, Uh Uh, Say uh uh
Say ohh (say) ohh (say) ohh (say) ooh
Say do that then, do that then put it on me
Mommy if you ain't scared, say ohh... ohh

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I make it bounce like my booty was a 6-4
I'm feelin' nice off that Mally and that Hypno
All eyes on me
Q-U-DOUBLE E-N B-DOUBLE E, yo!
People scream Lil' Kim real loud around me
Doin' that thing and it's a whole crowd around me
Once I get the second one I'm goin' back in
DJ, bring that joint back again
So I can take it to the floor
Once more before I hit that door
Like Big Daddy Kane, nigga I get raw
Picture me tannin' nude by the pool
Fool wake up you startin' to drool
See I'm down, and I get it in with ya
Like the 24's I wanna spin with ya
Uhh ohh, you can get it daddy
Switch it up, back it up, just for you daddy

[Chorus]
Back it up, clap it up
Switch it up, change it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me
Flip it up, give it up
I'ma grip it up while you rip it up
Do that thing for me
Do that thing for me

[Outro: Lil' Kim]
Oooh

J-Boog and Raz-B
T.U.G. and Queen Bee
Representin' B.K. and L.A to the fullest
Chris Stokes, we outta here baby
Yeah, this is history, boy
Ya girl Lil' Kim
You can call me Miss Brooklyn
And it's on, and it's on
