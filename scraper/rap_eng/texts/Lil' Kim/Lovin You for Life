[Intro: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
Uh, uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh, uh
Hey

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I remember sellin' three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, reigned on competition like a shower
A .38, a lot of mouth was our only weapon
We was kings till the D's crept in; and now I'm stressin'
Gave him half my paper, told 'em "Go that route!"
Few months, he got his brain blown out, now I'm missin' him

[Hook: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
In your love (in your love)
That's where I'll be, my baby
In my heart (oh yeah)
I'll always keep you with me (not a day)
Not a day goes by (without you)
Without you on my mind
I'll be loving you for life (I'll be loving you)
Think about you all the time

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
It's been a while
But I can never forget your smile
Seems like yesterday, you were in my arms
I wasn't ready, ready for you to leave so soon
No matter what I know you're in my heart

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
His baby's mother, she trippin', blamin' me
And his older brothers understand the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brother, they mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in N.Y.?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I'd look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye; damn, I'm missin' him

[Hook: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
In your love (In your love, love, love, love)
That's where I'll be, my baby (that's where I'll be, my baby)
In my heart (oh yeah)
I'll always keep you with me (not a day goes by)
Not a day goes by (without you on my mind)
Without you on my mind
I'll be loving you for life (I'll be loving you for life)
Think about you all the time

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
I been handling your death like the undertaker
Keep you close to my heart like the pacemaker
Damn, I'm missin' the way we used to kissin'
And you cookin' your favourite dishin'
Fish 'n' Spaghetti
For you to die, I wasn't ready
And life after death, ain't been so fresh
B-I-G, G-I-E
Still a motherfuckin' king of NYC
Period!

[Bridge: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
I can't you bring you back (I can't you bring you back)
I had to deal with the pain
But you're not around (around)
So much I wish I could say (I could say)
We still got your back (we still got your back)
I put that on everythin'
Never had the chance to say goodbye
(We really miss you 'BIG')

[Hook: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
In your love (yeah)
That's where I'll be, my baby (be)
In my heart (oh yeah)
I'll always keep you with me (not a day goes by)
Not a day goes by (without you)
Without you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll be loving you for life ( and I'll be loving you for life)
Think about you all the time

[Outro: Faith Evans & Lil' Kim]
In your love
That's where I'll be, my baby ('cause I really wanna' see you smile)
In my heart (oh-yeah)
I'll always keep you with me (not a day goes by)
Not a day goes by (without you)
Without you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll be loving you for life (I'll be loving you)
Think about you all the time
(We really miss you 'BIG')
