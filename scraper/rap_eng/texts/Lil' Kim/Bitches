[Intro: Tiffany Foxx]
Bend the pussy over then drop it to the floor
Bend the pussy over then drop it to the floor

[Verse 1: Tiffany Foxx]
Yeah, this is for my bitches
Yeah, it's time to get specific
We be yellin' "fuck these niggas"
If they lame and inconsistent
We be twerkin' in the mirror
See ya haters from the distance
If she tell you 'bout my man
Tell the bitch to mind her business
Curlin' iron on the stove
Get my hair done in the kitchen
See them hatin' ass hoes
When we walk past we got inches
See me with a new bitch
She not my friend, she my assistant
Suck my nigga dick so good
He thought I took out all my dentures

[Pre-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
(Anyway) anything goes
(Anyway) loyal to my hoes
(Anyway) if you not my bitches
(Anyway) then you gotta go
(Anyway) yeah, we super close
(Anyway) share our birth control
(Anyway) lift me when I cheated
(Anyway) and she never told
(Anyway)

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
This is for my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
This is for my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
Puttin' no nigga front my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
Puttin' no nigga front my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
This is, this is for my bitches

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
(Puttin' no nigga front my-)
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
(This is for my-)

[Bridge: Lil' Kim]
Fuck them other bitches 'cause I ride for my bitches
Fuck them other bitches 'cause I ride for my bitches
Fuck them other bitches 'cause I ride for my bitches
Fuck them other bitches, fuck another bitches niggas

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
Money over niggas if I see your money
Pull up in the Maybach and still give you that gunplay
I won't play about my bitches
What you say about my bitches?
I go back and forth with you hoes
All day about my bitches
If my bitch don't like you then I don't like you neither
If that boy a billionaire then he might be a keeper
Your nigga ain't faithful, he's probably like a cheater
And my bitch don't want him but she might just let him eat it
Thanks for holdin' my bundles
Back when I was throwin' up, girl
Thanks for always havin' my back
When we was growin' up, girl
Thanks for bein' loyal
When I was wrong, you ain't switch up, girl
Thanks for checkin' my nigga
When you caught him with that bitch, girl

[Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
This is for my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
This is for my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
Puttin' no nigga front my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
Puttin' no nigga front my bitches, my bitches, my bitches
This is, this is for my bitches

[Post-Hook: Tiffany Foxx]
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
(Puttin' no nigga front my-)
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
Anything goes, loyal to my hoes
(This is for my-)

[Outro: Tiffany Foxx & Lil' Kim]
Yeah, Tiffany Foxx
Queen Bee, Lil' Kim
Yeah, bitches for life
I love you, girl
This is for my bitches!
