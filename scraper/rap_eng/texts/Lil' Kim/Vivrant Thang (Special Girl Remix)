Verse 1: Lil' Kim
Uhhh
I'm yo special girl, yo real good girl
Biggest bitch in yo itty bitty world
Comin' up in the ninety-nine, every other word i say
Be part of my rhyme
Catch me outside of the club, smokin' seltzer wit jason
Get my mind fucked up, and my heartbeat racin'
You can call me, your crafty honey
I don't give a fuck, as long as you give me the money
And if you ever violate this, call me a bitch
Or forget to run the ???, You better do your little thang
Mack it around, and do your little thing
Uh-huh, uh-huh
