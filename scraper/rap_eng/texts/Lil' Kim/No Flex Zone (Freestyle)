[Hook]
Won a gold medal, and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now you hoes jealous
Fake hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter

[Verse 1]
Ever since I came out the chain game
Word on the street, Kimmy gang bang
Red and blue diamonds, it's a drive-by
1-8-7 its the same thang'
Killing these hoes, it's a genocide
Pussy drown a nigga, like riptides
500 bottles, shittin' it ho
I ain't gotta flex on this song tho

[Interlude]
They know better
They know better

[Verse 2]
Take a bitch man, like a klepto'
He swimming in the pussy, like a breaststroke
It's fuck these hoes, like a porno
Necklace, bracelet, watch froze
I don't set trip, I set trends
Pull up in that two-thousand twenty Benz
Cause I be on that new shit, bananas in my asshole
My man be on that zoo shit, wanna fuck me til' my eyes roll

No flex...
They know better
They know better

[Hook]

No flex, no flex

[Hook: Rae Sremmurd]
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
No flex zone, no flex zone
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal and a gold bezel
I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
