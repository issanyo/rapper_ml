[Havoc]
Now here's a little story I got to tell
About a gangsta-ass bitch, y'all know so well
It started way back, in history
With Lil' Kim, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G

Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! ... WHOAHHHH!

[Verse 1]
Now here's a little story I gots to tell
Bout the first rap bitch to rock Chanelle
Tought you how to get money and pop Cristal
Even gave y'all tips on ridin cock as well
The Beehive, sticker say "better beware"
If it's buzzin in the spot you know my boys is here (bzzzz)
Cause we in the parkin lot, you know the toys is there
Pushin drop Bee wagons, two doors, ya hear?
Hold it now, the Queen's sittin in the chair
Now y'all wanna dress sexy and dye your hair?
Will the real Kim stand up?  It's frauds in here
I'm bout to pull the plug on all y'all broads this year
(Lights out!)

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Kim]
When we come to the clubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin right (hold it, hold it now)
Come chill in V.I.P. with us for the night - WHOAHHHH!

[Verse 2]
Now all my all my all my bitches rub ya titties (if ya love Biggie)
And all my niggas grab ya dicks if you feelin a bitch
I'm in the middle of the dancefloor (go Kim, go Kim) killin the shit
With the Belve', tryin not to spill any shit
You know the Queen show love when I'm up in the club
I like to play with my coochie when I'm up in the tub
You a, sensitive thug, lemme give you a hug
Y'all thirsty-ass niggas take this bottle of bub
I'm the, First Lady, so I can't lose
Because of me y'all rock rhymes in high heel shoes
Lil' Kim the Grammy winner get love worldwide
Now hold that, yo Havoc, let the beat ride

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And since Frank White taught me how to play the game
La Bella Mafia, nigga I play to reign
They put my album in the street like they pump the 'caine
I'm like bleach - Lil' Kim leave a permanent stain!
I'm feared in my country like Saddam Hussein
I might give a, little head to {"hold it, hold it now"}
All we ask is y'all show respect
Cause we don't want talk, big homey, just cut the check!
Now I'm sittin outside in my 6.6
Just signed a lil' deal bout 6.6
Used to transport bricks and make 6.6
If you look in my garage I got 6 joints

[Chorus]

Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! ... WHOAHHHH!
