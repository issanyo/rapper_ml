[Swizz Beatz]
The Monster (ohh) Queen Bee (uh-uh)
Can't be serious! (uh-uh!) Fix your face!

[Swizz] + (Kim)
We're gonna do a son (yea yea)
That you neva heard befo' (aww yeah!)
We comin to take this y'all, take this y'all
We comin to rock this y'all (this is a world premier)
Y'all ain't ready for it, uh-uh
But get ready for it (aww yeah!) (world premier)
Queen Bee (Yo Swizz where it at baby?) Talk to 'em
(Where it at?) Talk to 'em, talk to 'em, talk to 'em

[Lil' Kim] + (Swizz)
Just to prove to y'all niggas that I'm still on top
I told Swizz, give me the gutter shit you got (I got you)
And I'mma give it to you raw whether you like it or not
Like it's my last bullet and I only got one shot
Aim straight for the middle like I'm throwin a dart
And when I spit, believe it's goin straight to your heart
I lay my mack game down nigga, straight from the start
Don't take it personal baby -- fuck you, pay me!
Ain't nuttin but ladies in my dark blue Mercedes
With the Parabas kit, got niggas mad as shit
No we never sip unless it's ice in our drinks
But sometimes we get cold from the ice on our minks
That fly-girl persona, it's the primadonna world
Act like you ain't heard about the, Gabbana girls
Holly-Hood style gettin LOVE around the globe
You might catch me next season on the cover of Vogue!

[Hook: Lil' Kim]
Y'all niggas done gone delirious
And y'all hoes, can't be serious
Queen Bee, Swizz Beatz, they scared of us
Y'all know it ain't no comparin us

[Lil' Kim] + (Swizz)
I got moves in this game, the other chick is a fraud (beyotch!)
I'm important -- like the queen on a chess board
Bitches talk slick, but they ain't got nuttin for me
When I'm in they terriotory, it's a whole 'nother story
We never get stuck, sometimes we take the long route
When our back's against the wall, we bang our way out
I'm in the gettin money mode, livin by the street code
Bout to have, every corner of this rap game sewed
Hey hey - you homies better start, showin some respect
Or get slapped silly -- heard my man G. Dep!
Hey hey hey - quit tryin to holla at the bee and you think you fly
Impress me dog, throw some money in the sky!
Queen Team rockin the yellow and black jerseys
Pull-out the black Denali when I'm ridin with my dirties
Six six six, that's the mark of the beast
I love God nigga - and I'm reppin the streets (c'mon!)

[Hook]

[Lil' Kim] + (Swizz)
Return of the widow, it's goin down kiddo
Y'all hate me, huh; yeah aight - ditto!
That's why I keeps the fo'-five in the pillow
Trespassers, they gon' DIE in the cribbo
Uhh, black Barbie, knows how to party
Don't ride but I still cop a Harley
Don't lie - who else is hot besides me?
Worldwide, I crush everybody!
And I shouldn't have to tell y'all who run the city
Even my seven-year-old niece Rizzy, knows I gets busy
You know the name, Lil' Kim, high class (woop woop!)
Shake it shorty with yo' high-priced ass
Tryin to be a billionaire, I got things to do
I made my mark in this game, who the fuck are you? (Yeah)
They say I'm pretty like chrome on chrome
And that feelin at the top is like home sweet home (beyotch!)

[Swizz Beatz]
Y'all ain't ready for it
The Queen Bee, y'all ain't ready for her
Ohh, y'all ain't ready for it
Yo, put your hands in the air, c'mon!

[Hook]

[Swizz Beatz]
Get your hands in the air (the monster)
Everybody get your hands in the air (Queen Bee)
Yo, get your hands in the air (it's ugly)
Everybody get your hands in the air (we here)
Yo, get your hands in the air (ohh, ohh)
Everybody get your hands in the air (yea, ohh, ohh)
Yo, get your hands in the air (uhh)
Everybody get your hands in the air (y'all gon' need new amps)
Heh.. it's ugly!
