Baby just stop
I'm so tired of playing
Stop, no more games
Baby just stop
I'm so tired of playing
Stop, no more games

[Skin Deep]
I'm on my way out
So many things that you did wrong
You fooled, you lied, cheated
Now my love is gone
And I gave you all I had in this world
Not bad of me me to say it
But I need it 'fore I go

Ooh I can remember then, yeah
You were going to the movies
My best friend said he saw you
But you were not with me
Now I don't want no explanations
Don't give me no excuse
Girl I'm running you off
Now for you constant love abuse

Repeat 1

[Skin Deep]
Well I gave you all the loving that you wanted baby
But even though I tried it wasn't enough for you baby
My heart was all that you needed
Well now it's over and it's time for you to do it

[Lil' Kim]
Baby, it's the finest, dimest
What'cha talkin' bout you wanna grind this?
(Whoo!)Get to know me
I need that full metal jacket like Tom Hanks
Banks to chips B.I. pack the clips
Junior M.A.F.I.A. sticks
Any nigga try-na disrespect who I be
Cause I roll with the B.I.G
In the six double O accell
Shoes from Chanel I bet that female
Can't you tell living well?
Parachute goes feeling lucho
Lil' Kim be solo papi chulo
Wanna see me smile pop the Cristal
So I can get my drink on
And get skin deep on you creeps
Try-na do me by takin' me to a dinner and a movie
You just a big silly frontin' willie
Babe roll you got to go
Don't take it personal
Full of games it's just one of those things

[Skin Deep]
No more games, I am tired of your silly lies
No more games, I am tired of your silly lies
No more games, I am tired of your silly lies
No more games, I am tired of your silly lies

I gave you all the loving that you wanted baby
But even though I tried it wasn't enough for you baby
My heart was all that you needed
And now it's over and it's time for you to do it baby

Repeat 1

You see baby check out
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
Don't wanna be
Don't wanna be a fool alone

Repeat 1 till end
