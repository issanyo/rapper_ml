{entire song set to the melody of R. Kelly's "A Woman's Threat"}

[Lil' Kim - speaking]
Yo.. I just don't understand
Lately, it seems like.. I don't know
It just seems like.. it seems like
Everybody wants

[Lil' Kim - singing]
My style, my life, my blood
My shoes, my clothes, my gear
My watch, my rings, my chain
My cars, my money, my home
My body, my sweat, my tears
My power, my fame, my strength
My shit, my this, my that
Bitches, please!

[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
If you don't stop;
Someone's gonna find yo' ass dead (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna poison your food (this is a warning)
Someone's puttin tags on your toes (this is a warning)
Someone better pray for you (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna get yo' keys (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna open your door (this is a warning)
Someone's gonna creep in your house (this is a warning)
And put the {*chk-chk*} straight in your, mouuuuuth
... This is a woman's, THREAT (this is a woman's)

[Lil' Kim - singing with "whoa, whoa whoa, whoa" repeating]
Have you ever heard the story, about the M.A.F.I.A. tip
See Big Poppa was shot, a long long long long time ago
And when he was killed, he left me with the throne
And now it seems like, everyone wants my blood

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[Lil' Kim - over Chorus]
Don't stop, no no
You'll be sorry
Keep doin it, you'll see
You'll be cryin
I know, whatchu doin
Cause I'm watchin
Hohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
Ohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
Ohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
Ohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
Ohhhhohhhohhhhohoohohohhhhohohhhhhhh
