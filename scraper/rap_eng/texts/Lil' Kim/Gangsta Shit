[Intro]
You're all a bunch of fuckin' assholes
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers
And say "That's the bad guy"
So say good night to the bad guy
Go on
Last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again

[Puff]	To be or not to be
[Mase]	My mother's wrong
[Puff]	That's the question, you feel me?
[Mase]	My father was wrong
[Puff]	They say I'm wrong
	So they say
[Mase]	So they say
[Puff]	Ha ha, come on
	It's like this right here
[Mase]	To all my niggas, check this out

	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit

	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit
	It's that, gangsta gangsta, gangsta shit

[Puffy]
Ain't another crew like us
That could do like us
See the world from a view like us
Still always come through like us
They ain't true like us
If they only knew like us
It's less than a small few like us
And they ain't pay dues like us
Never on P's and Q's like us
They don't move like us
They don't have the right to choose like us
Or get mad cause they ain't grew like us
They ain't on cue like us
They don't fit the shoe like us
Don't know who's who like us (who dat?)
Strangers, ain't aware of the danger
They head's up wit thoroughbred cats
That knock 'em back, they get the axe
And a hard case to crack
I'm a hard face to track
Fast as they can test us
We flip 'em on they backs, like that
The many men that make us great must stay together
Cause together, we're hard to break

Repeat 1

[Mark Curry]
Look out mutha fucka
I tried to warn 'em
You don't wanna double cross us
Haven't you heard how many guy they lost with us
You don't wanna floss with us
Cause shit cost with us
Ain't nobody boss but us
We got force wit us, of course it's us
It's no being better off than us
And ain't a hotter source than us
And these streets ain't divorcing us
We ain't got no remorse in us
Know to hold your horse with us
No cuttin' shorts with us
Here to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us
Between us we got the mic domain and artillery
Therefore, it's all free reign, who's domain
When shots ring, who remains, they refrain
Who walks away with the gain
Us
Thorough niggas that's hard to top
Together we're too hard to stop

Repeat 1

[Lil' Kim]
Ain't a bitch like me that can spit like me
Who could say they rich like me
They don't hold the four fifth like me
Ain't a hit like me
Nobody load the clip like me
Cut coke and flip like me
Make hit after hit like me
Wear the title Queen Bitch like me
Ya'll ain't good in bed like me
And ya'll don't give head like me
Plus your crew don't break bread like me
Think about it, this a one shot deal
Ya'll got one shot still
When my gunshot peel, that's a one shot kill
I'm so far ahead ya'll can't touch my land spread
Cause most of ya'll is misled and underfed
Hey, what can I say, I'm a little vain
Now all aboard if you ridin' my train
Choo chooo, throw it up and represent your gang
Whether you from the east side (East side)
Or the west side (West Side)
Worldwide

Repeat 1
