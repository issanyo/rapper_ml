[Intro]
Can you feel it?
'Cause I can
Oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 1]
I been on my grind for a while now
Time to attack now
Lean in the low in the background
Can't stop my hustle, it's for life
Gotta get that money
I won't let no one put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to top
Things ain't goin' right
You need a Lil' Kim in your life

[Chorus]
I'm that light when you can't see
That air when you can't breathe
I'm that [?]
I'm that voice when you can't speak
I'm your, your respirator
I'm that high when you feel low
I'm that strength when you feel weak
I'm that truth when you don't believe
I'm that blood that your heart beats
I'm your, your respirator

[Hook]
If you feel me, go "oh, oh-la-hee-oh, oh"
If you hear me, go "oh, om-na-ha-lo-eh"

[Verse 2]
People sweated on Lil' Kim
But I'm not what they think I am
Instead of hatin' on what you see
Come get to know me
I'm done with playin' by the same ol' rules
Ya girl over here makin' major moves
Sick and tired of the same ol' dudes
I smell new money
I know I like to dance sleezy
No, but that don't mean that I'm easy
First he gotta know how to please me
And I'll be there if he needs me
But I won't let no man put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to the top
Things ain't goin' right
He need a Lil' Kim in his life

[Chorus]
I'm that light when you can't see
That air when you can't breathe
I'm that [?]
I'm that voice when you can't speak
I'm your, your respirator
I'm that high when you feel low
I'm that strength when you feel weak
I'm that truth when you don't believe
I'm that blood that your heart beats
I'm your, your respirator

[Hook]
If you feel me, go "oh, oh-la-hee-oh, oh"
If you hear me, go "oh, om-na-ha-lo-eh"

[Verse 3]
To all my people across the world
Need the life support? Then I'm ya girl
Tt's a jungle in these streets
Don't let them get you
'Cause I been through the same ol' things
I know it's hard to get out the game
Dealin' with the hurt and pain
I'm ridin' with you
I know every day is a struggle
Tryna get by, don't want the trouble
But if you touch a piece of my puzzle
You gon' get a piece of my muscle
'Cause I don't let no one put me in a box
I'm gon' fight my way to the top
Things ain't goin' right
You need a Lil' Kim in your life

[Chorus]
I'm that light when you can't see
That air when you can't breathe
I'm that [?]
I'm that voice when you can't speak
I'm your, your respirator
I'm that high when you feel low
I'm that strength when you feel weak
I'm that truth when you don't believe
I'm that blood that your heart beats
I'm your, your respirator
