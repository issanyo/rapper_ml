(Real sick) [x8] (Ha-ha! Uh)
Lil' Kim is (Phenomenal) (Uh)
Queen Bee (Real sick) (Phenomenal)
(Real sick) [x5] (Phenomenal)

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
It's Lil' Kim, the one they all love and hate
The Queen's back bitches, regurgitate
I got these hoes real sick like a stomach ache
Blue-faced Rollies, animals on my vertebrae
We out the country, nah we don't do States
Married to the game, nah we don't do dates
I'm eatin' good, but I gotta watch my weight
Fourteen carats in my salad gold plate (Ha-ha-ha)
I treat the track like a bedpan
I got ill thoughts, need a head scan
Got that old money, like the Bread Man
That's why these bitches all rotten like a dead man
From London to Italy, Romania to France
I'm diplomat status, check the passport stamps
You hoes is pathetic, faker than prosthetics
Somebody call the paramedics

[Hook: Lil' Kim & The Notorious B.I.G.]
I got these hoes (Real sick)
Cause the flow (Real sick)
They at the show (Real sick)
Front row (Real sick)
Queen Bee (Real sick)
Lil' Kim is (Phenomenal)
The ass (Real sick)
And the pussy's (Phenomenal)
The swag (Real sick)
Birkin bag (Real sick) (Uh)
Jimmy Choos (Real sick) (D-block)
Bentley coupes (Real sick) (L-O-X)
Queen Bee (Real sick) (Ha-ha!)
Lil' Kim is (Phenomenal) (Uh. Yeah. Yo.)

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
No fake shit, permanent realness
The minute that you feel this, it's terminal illness
Incurable, they ain't able to heal this
All I ever try to do is give you the real 'Kiss (Muah!)
Let it off then we fleeing the scene
They ain't see us but they heard that it was me and the Queen
I got this Tom Ford shit on, and she in McQueen
Think I'm going colorblind, all I see is the green
Ain't worth counting if it ain't done properly
House on the mountain, V12's on the property
Cup full of drink, big Dutch full of broccoli
Cancer on the track, even Dre can't doctor me
No penicillin, no antibiotic
Just the Purple Haze, lil' something exotic
Booth or the barrel, quicker to the cabbage
Al-Qaeda Jada, sicker than your average

[Hook: Jadakiss & The Notorious B.I.G.]
And you know I'm (Real sick)
Chain got 'em (Real sick)
Game got 'em (Real sick)
My name got 'em (Real sick)
I been had 'em (Real sick)
Cause my bars is (Phenomenal)
Yeah (Real sick)
Nothing like y'all I'm (Phenomenal)
And you know I'm (Real sick)
Chain got 'em (Real sick)
Game got 'em (Real sick)
My name got 'em (Real sick)
I been had 'em (Real sick)
Cause my bars is (Phenomenal)
