Pardon my fragrance, i smell just like the dealership
Yea, we in the same whip but ya' car rented bitch
Yea, we on the same club but we on some different shit
We in VIP poppin’ bottles just to spill the shit
Huh, poppin’ bottle just to spill the shit
Hold up! I think I gotta extra clip *cocks gun*
You know kim, the realest bitch up in the industry
You know kim, the realest bitch up in the industry
You know kim, the realest bitch up in the industry
Matter fact, I’m the realest bitch up in the streets
Ask your man, i’m the realest bitch up in the sheets
I don’t keep it a hundred, I keep it a g
You know I switch my man like every week
He acting up (ghetto ghetto ghetto)

Or into the next one, or into the fresh one
VVS stones, yeah you know I got that S1
Bitches throwing shots, they gon fuck around and catch one
It’s the queen bitch here, i’m a flyer than a Jetson
That mean i’m futuristic
Call the coupe Mike Bivins, it’s that new edition
When a boss bitch talking you should sit and listen
Take notes, pay attention
It’s what separates the fakest from the realest, bitch
