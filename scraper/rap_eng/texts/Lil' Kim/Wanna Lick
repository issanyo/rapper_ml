[Chorus: Lil' Kim (50 Cent)]
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (BO!)
Act like it's christmas and put me on your wish list (BO!)
When it go down I'm a help you blow your whiskers (BO!)
Put your lips on my lips and taste my honey (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)

[50 Cent]:
You know you want me you probably wanna lick this (BO!)
Girl I'm a treat everyday you can't get this (BO!)
I'm busy man I be handlin my business (BO!)
But we can get our freak on some quick shit (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Tonight's the night shorty you'll never forget this
I dim the lights I get it right I'm like a pimp sick
Down on the bed I make the clothes disappear quick
I see through her shit it curl up pretty clear kid
I'm turned on now I really wanna hit
Kiss, her neck and nibble till I'm way down on her waist kid
Man she's a freak I'm a freak I be freakin off
When she come in with a friend I might take it off
I got a fetish for the cheddar yeah I'm rich bitch
That don't mean I'm runnin 'round buyin chicks shit
You see the chrome doubt be shinin on my new six
My pinky ring my neck my ears and my wrist lit
I like the ice I'm pretty nice on the dice trip
Twice in a row you know, I got to get the dough
My confidence is high, I know I could hit or lick
My g's pretty good, I know I could get the bitch

[Chorus: Lil' Kim (50 Cent)]
You know you want me you probably wanna kiss this (BO!)

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
I'll be your wife I'll be your girl I'll be your mistress
But if you ain't spendin that dough your gettin dismissed
That mean you gotta keep me laced like I seemed stressed
You can't expect nothin less from the Queen Bitch
My doggystyle make you wanna jump on that (BO!)
Just like a dog on that chase for the kitty kat (BO!)
Man he's a freak I'm a freak be freakin off (BO!)
He pour the honey on me, and then he clean me off (BO! BO! BO! BO! BO! BO!)
I take his breath away Kim leave 'em speechless
I'm so wet I'll have a nigga feelin sea sick
He in the streets all day but it's alright
Cause he'll be back tonight, and the next night
And the next night, because the sex tight
I'll be his Advil I gotta keep his head right
He outta town and he feenin for me every night
He's so addicted sendin for me on the next flight

[Chorus: Lil' Kim (50 Cent)]
