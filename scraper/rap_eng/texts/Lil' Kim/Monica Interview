Thanks for the interview Monica
Now Monica, everyone seems to think they know ALL there is to know
About Monica Lewinsky -- but Monica, could you tell us one thing
That people would be surprised to know about you?

"I used to be scared of the dick; now I throw lips to the shit
Handle it, like a real bitch.."

[Chris Rock]
Very interesting! Now Monica, there seems to be a lot of demands
On your time. Could you tell us what a quiet evening with
Monica Lewinsky would be like?

"Got buffoons eatin my pussy while I watch cartoons.."

[Chris Rock]
Hmm, sounds like fun!
Now Monica, who were your role models?

"Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches.."

[Chris Rock]
Now in the transcript, you refer to the President as Butthead
Did the President have any nicknames for you?

"Poon-poon nanny-nanny, punanni danni.."

[Chris Rock]
Ahh, cute!
Now Monica, you and the President had a lot of phone sex
What was the one thing that you would say to the President
That would make him acheive orgasm?

"Before you nut, I'mma dribble down your buttcheek
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a little.."

[Chris Rock]
Now Vernon Jordan helped you get a job
What's the first thing you said when you met Vernon Jordan?

"It's on nigga what? Pussy greased up
Stack the G's up, keeps the knees up.."

"I made my intro, gettin fucked in the Pinto.."

[Chris Rock]
Monica you appear to be having sex with everybody
How do the interns treat you?

With the President?
