[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Bitch better have my money!
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money!
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Ballin' bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money
Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?
Like bra, bra, bra

[Pre-Chorus]
Louis XIII and it's all on me, nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots, shots, shots
Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot

[Chorus]
Bitch better have my money!
Bitch better have my money!
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my (bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my money!

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
Bitch better have my dough
Bitch better have my cash
You can't call me Chanel, cause I'm coming for the bag
With a 100 bitches like Will
Queen Bee the Madame, The Milf
Me and Rih jumped out the Wraith
We got the whole club on tilt
I can take yo bitch
100k on the wrist lil nigga can you buy that?
Balmain sheets thats 20 when I sleep
Lil nigga can you buy that?
And I'm in the Ghost with the chauffuer
No sir nigga we don't drive that
Sweet pussy Saturday and he got a gold grill
Nigga trying to Plies that
Eagle that's bold pussy
He want that bald pussy
That cat so fat he can see it from the back
That there is all pussy
He having withdrawals in that pussy
Had to thank the Lord in that pussy
I'm the butterfly and the pimp
Queen Bee the landlord hoes it's time to pay the rent ho
Yellow Rari on the block
Yellow tape like I caught a body on the block
Don't act like you forgot I call the shots like bra, bra, bra

[Outro: Rihanna]
Turn it to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drop, I am the only thing y'all playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like bra, bra, bra
