[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Oh I get it, oh okay
Niggas tryna, niggas tryna, tryna be on some slick shit
How you gone do a freaky girl song and not include Nicki Minaj?
I mean come on now, you know my fuckin' name, let's get it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uhnn you want a freaky girl? Welcome to Nicki World
N-N-N-Nicki's world, N-N-N-Nicki's world
Um, let me think, what could I do to kick it off?
How bout I cum all on your dick and then I lick it off?
I mean it's something so funny when it get soft
I like to play with it, squeeze it like a stress ball
He say he like to hear the sound of me slurpin' it
Turn off his phone cause them hoes keep churpin' it
Tell me that I get the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it, I can be his ol' girl
Fuck I look like turning down some head?
I mean that's sorta like a bird turning down some bread?
You can eat it like a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet, I'm a freak, I love to beat, just don't get none in my sheets
Every time I pop the coochie, Gucci start chokin' me
Now I'm kinda scared I got a feelin' Gucci stalkin' me
Sex game kinky, niggas call me Pinky
Fuck with presidents, I am Nicki Lewinsky

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
I'm a very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Very freaky gurl, very freaky gurl, gurl
Ohhh, you want a freaky girl? Welcome to Kimmy's world
You ain't gon' wanna leave, it's like a kid at Disney World
My deep throat have you squirtin' like a water gun
Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more to come
Friends tell 'em more to come, we gon have some orgy fun, Yeaaaah
Chew on me like some bubble gum
Might lick you like a lollipop once you taste my honey bun
It's our lil' secret, just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear? Smack my ass, grab my neck, got em cummin' everywhere
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shopping sprees he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)
Zoom like Boosie on the back of his Suzuki and I ain't even sex em'
All I did was let him eat my... coochie!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
