[Verse 1]
Who shot ya? I'm the Notorious K.I.M
Queen Bitch, cause the streets say I am
Play private airports, fashion week I'm on the runways
Feds tryna tie me to all sorts of gunplay
Must be the mon-ey
Paparazzi looking for my limo I breeze out in the Hyundai
Biggie warned me the more money more problems
Now that I'm on the new levels, I see the new devils
My flame stay on high, so I walks right through em
Old school, new school, I really don't care
I burn baby burn like smokey the bear
Y'all don't want nothing here, it's election season
And your number one candidate is leading
The lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with Queen Bee it ain't safe
Leave the stinger in your face, like you got the mumps
Kim spit that shit to give you niggas goosebumps
Honey girl break rules, make moves
Bitches mad cause I keep multi-millionaire dudes all around me
A billion cock rhymes, any of you bitches
Whisperin about mines, and I'm and I'm
Bedstuy's finest, you rewind this
Brooklyn's behind this
GO BROOKLYN!

[Hook]

Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep, in the Brooklyn streets
Hard to creep, the Brooklyn streets
Nigga it's on in these Brooklyn streets
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep, in the Brooklyn streets
It's on in these Brooklyn streets
Nigga it's on in these Brooklyn streets

[Verse 2]
I seen the light, got rid of all the creeps
Camera's in the crib, bullet proofed out the jeep
Y'all go ahead and sleep, better watch your back
Think the coke and law enforcement acts make me slack?
A bitch is all that, cock suckers ease up
This laser beam device make a nigga freeze up
Cut the check, respect I demand it
Slip and break the seventh commandment
Thou shall not fuck with the Queen, or see Poppa
Send you up to BIG in the chopper
I feel for you, pop my collar like the Fonz
Royalty watch, while Lil' Kim on the arm
Put your money where your mouth is, contracts in the briefcase
You know the time and the place
Make sure you remember my face snake bitches
Fake bitches, what the fuck y'all wanna do bitches?
More better than the haystacks
I'm in the phantom, she's in the Maybac
Flex got his arms in the fire position n'
Bout' to drop the bomb, hope you haters is listenin'
What

[Hook]
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep, in the Brooklyn streets
Hard to creep, the Brooklyn streets
Nigga it's on in these Brooklyn streets
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep, in the Brooklyn streets
It's on in these Brooklyn streets
Nigga it's on in these Brooklyn streets
