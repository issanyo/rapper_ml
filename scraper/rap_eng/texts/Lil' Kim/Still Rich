[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
Young Khalifa and Bern
Real niggas in this bitch
Everybody do what the fuck they want
Uh

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
It's not a thing we can't afford
We walk up in the club
Bitches want free bud
It's not a thing we can't afford
Don't even say my name
We just rep my gang
It's not a thing we can't afford
We roll that good weed up
Tell 'em meet with us
It's not a thing we can't afford
So get in my car
Tell your friends you tryna' roll

[Verse 1: Berner]
Splash
Pretty bitches give me cash
Pull up, hop out, 40 in my pants
Bag full of gas, got the whole crew lit
I'm on the twenty-third floor with my best friend's bitch
Just smokin', thinkin' about the world, dice rollin'
Police behind me, blue lights glowin'
Keep goin', I ain't gonna stop (Hell nah)
Fuck a cell, I don't wanna rot
I keep pretty bitches choosin'
They love me, I'm really neat
If she wanna stick around, she gonna need to bring a fleet
Dom Pérignon, we gonna burn a little weed
She just sucked off Ren, now she want Ricky P
We get money and shake fake friends that get funny
Pull the old schools out when it's sunny
Big papa, they love to rub my tummy
Got the renegade hoes runnin' from me

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
It's not a thing we can't afford
We walk up in the club
Bitches want free bud
It's not a thing we can't afford
Don't even say my name
We just rep my gang
It's not a thing we can't afford
We roll that good weed up
Tell 'em meet with us
It's not a thing we can't afford
So get in my car
Tell your friends you tryna' roll

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Wanna kick it with me
Twist all my trees
Watch Apple TV, take trips over seas
She told me she feenin' for a reason
This dark tint, all this weed sick, you can't see in
Get hoes home and get em' out they clothes
Smoke marijuana by the O, our eyes low
My pockets covered in zero's
Bitches run up to me like a hero
My niggas rob like De Niro
He know, she know we high, we smoke
The whole bowl load, call the weed man
To bring some more
And tell them bitches I don't need they digits
I got a bunch of women from other continents comin' in
Smoke more weed, pass on more things
Reflect on all the good shit this cash and this joy brings
And for them hoes, I got room in the back
Fit four if your small, fit two if your fat

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
It's not a thing we can't afford
We walk up in the club
Bitches want free bud
It's not a thing we can't afford
Don't even say my name
We just rep my gang
It's not a thing we can't afford
We roll that good weed up
Tell 'em meet with us
It's not a thing we can't afford
So get in my car
Tell your friends you tryna' roll

[Verse 3: Lil Kim]
I'm a shop-a-holic, I need help
I'm an addict
Bought the same Birkin twice, I forgot that I had it
To grip this figure, need at least six-figures
It cost to watch me, so watch your nigga
I used to move base like Jeter
I'm a fly bitch out the borough
But I'm leavin' out teeter
Talkin' private sex on a private jet
I'm a Moschino ho, with a valentino flow
These Givenchys cost me thirty-three hundred
I pop a Dom P while my niggas get blunted
Tell Berner break up the P while Wiz roll up the weed
Wanna be my main squeeze, nigga please
To fill these shoes, you gonna need big feet
We never lookin' at the tags we just throw it in the bag
Fifty bottles of Cris, thirty bottles of Moët
Twenty [?] and keep the tab open

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
It's not a thing we can't afford
We walk up in the club
Bitches want free bud
It's not a thing we can't afford
Don't even say my name
We just rep my gang
It's not a thing we can't afford
We roll that good weed up
Tell 'em meet with us
It's not a thing we can't afford
So get in my car
Tell your friends you tryna' roll
