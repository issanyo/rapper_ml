Everybody wanna talk about Kim
But ain’t nothing soft about Kim
Everything you walk about Kim
Through all that I’ve been
Picture me being broke and I can auction my pen, please
I ain’t never worry about hens, they worry about me
But I ain’t worry about them
I’d rather see them coughing up phlegm
Off with they heads, guillotine Kim so it’s off with they limbs

Why pop cork with my men
When I was up north in the pen, my fans wrote me
They said queen keep doing ya thing write songs so we can quote thee
The rest of ya'll we
See our downfall, so I don’t come around y’all
Now I’m beyond rich, the spittin magician poof be gone bitch

Bitch couldn’t walk a mile in my Louboutins
Me against you that’s asinine
QB bout the bomb, Taliban
Coming through the north trench, caliban
Bitch you was just a child of mine and im casey I'mma get off scott free
Sipping don pee on palm beach
Original OG, my alonski
Break bread with the IRS family

While these jamie hoes tryna get fancy
I live the life of a queen I’m royalty bitch
Bow down kiss the ring
Money, power, respect is the song I sing
All I see is dollar signs, all I hear is cha ching
Bow into your fears have u staring at a long gun
Didn’t realize you fucked with the wrong one
