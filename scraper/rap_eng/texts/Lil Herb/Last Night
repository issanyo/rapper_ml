[Intro]
This could be ya last night birth live the fast life
Work keep the cash right, work color all white
Shootouts in the hood make a nigga member last night
Trapsots thats every night, a shooter I  don't fist fight

[Hook: Lil Herb]
Every night I'm out here
I'm wide awoke, tryna get my bread right
Right by that store watch out for them fed lights
Roll up that smoke gotta get my head right
Bitch every night cus this my last night
Pour up that codeine too slow up my fast life
Thanks to that codeine can't remember last night
My heart so cold feel like December every night
Them heaters wit us every night

[Verse: Gino Marley]
This could be ya last night birth live the fast life
Work keep the cash right, work color all white
Shootouts in the hood make a nigga member last night
Trapsots thats every night, a shooter I  don't fist fight
Slow bitches wanna catch a pace of the glory life
Stash packs you see the lights, corner store changed my life
Raised in the hood I remember havin' family fights
Drop about a 6 in the pop it darker up the sprite
Tryna rob headshots dummy you ain't live ya life
It's a cold world i play it like a winter night
Drop about a 6 in the pop it darker up the sprite
It's a cold world i play it like December night

[Hook]

[Verse: Lil Herb]
Just last night bump into a little bitch I ain't gone say shit but her head right
And that 745 mac-11 .45 red light
Pull up the other side roll the window down and ride in sight
And every time we ride it's the 4th of July catch jail lights
Posted up on the 9s smokin' dope with the guys that's everynight
Bitch I'm ridin' if I'm mad put it all on the line, you damn right
Fuck this rap shit nigga ain't no act here this my real life
I'm always in the field gotta tote to protect my damn life
Mad Max he a pro pull the tec to protect his mans life
No lie shawty slow he gets ne catch some every night
Heard a nigga got whacked this morning just night and last night
Pour the ack to aware my fast life huh

[Hook]

[Verse: SD]
I'm bout to burry these lil niggas
They don't wanna pull triggers
I got some shooters that do laundry and drliver
It's too much money to go broke for you little niggas
You wanna rob who boy you gone have to shoot
Boy you must be gettin' so high you need  a parachute
You love talkin' guns but you never shootin'
And we come through kickin' doors when the money's screwed
We got gun for a gun, shooter for a shooter
Body after body, boy let's see if this shit happen
We got gun for a gun, shooter for a shooter
Body after body, boy let's see if this shit happen

[Hook]
