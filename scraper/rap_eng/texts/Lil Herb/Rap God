[Intro]
I, I, I swear to God
I, I swear to God

[Hook]
I, I, used to starve
But I think God told me start selling hard
I think God made me stay out after dark
Think God told me if they run up on you, spark
I, I, swear to God
Way before this rap shit I had heart
Man I used to trap I used to starve
Then swear to God I start buying my own cars
I, I, I swear to God
Anywhere I go I'm still on guard
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God

[Verse 1]
They like Herbo how come God gave you them psychic bars
Why you did the rims on basic whips you always swiping cars
How you living right? Real, rich, and righteous. I recite the R's
Why you like to smile, how come your life ain't got much strife as ours?
Shit that I been through, I'll never show you
You cannot know it, cause I do not know you
Can't get up on me, don't know if you loyal
I might have one of my young niggas blow you
I put the crack pot, under the foil
I make it rock up, I let it boil
Run in my trap house, chopper destroy you
Baby bend over, I'm tryna enjoy you

[Hook]
I, I, used to starve
But I think God told me start selling hard
I think God, made me stay out after dark
Think God told me if they run up on you, spark
I, I, swear to God
Way before this rap shit I had heart
Man I used to trap I used to starve
Then swear to God I start buying my own cars
I, I, I swear to God
Anywhere I go I'm still on guard
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God

[Verse 2]
I pray that God help me notice all my flaws
Help me grind, pave the way, and notice all my dogs
My flight status say delayed, I'm like in Omaha
I got a show tonight it's way up in Whats-it-called
Imma miss another-nother flight before I don't go at all
Played the block so much my muscles tight and I ain't no Gasol
Took a loss or two, I ain't tripping though I'm just gon' blow it off
When I'm feeling sore Imma hit the store with something and blow it all
Hit the strip club throw it all
Tell lil sis tour the mall
I head them boys got in the game and they ain't score at all
My momma got my grades, told me just don't go at all
I was in the streets moved out the East Side I ain't know it all

[Hook]
I, I, used to starve
But I think God told me start selling hard
I think God, made me stay out after dark
Think God told me if they run up on you, spark
I, I, swear to God
Way before this rap shit I had heart
Man I used to trap I used to starve
Then swear to God I start buying my own cars
I, I, I swear to God
Anywhere I go I'm still on guard
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God
They say in this rap shit I'm like a God
