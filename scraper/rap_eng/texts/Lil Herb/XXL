[Intro: Lil Durk]
Ay man ya'll better put Herb on that muhfucking XXL cover man forreal. Only a few muhfuckers on there probably deserve to be on that muhfucker, that deserve to be on there, so salute to ya'll on that muhfucker. But Herb supposed to be on that muhfucker so shout out to Herb, go crazy

[Verse 1]
I'm like the under overdog y'all commercial and y'all marketable
But I'm over y'all I was born a star, just ask my mom
It's like I'm posed to ball
Pull up, hop up out that drivers seat don't got no chauffeur dawg
OG Kush I'm smoking on
In a daze, pushin blow, early morn
By the store 20 thou for a show I ain't hurting no more
And I'm only 19 but moms ain't working no more
She ain't hurt no more
Told my mom she ain't never gotta work no more
She ain't never gotta hurt no more
And I move like a boss so she ain't gotta worry bout her son on a shirt no more
Eating hundred dollar steak, young nigga I ain't wait for the lick on the first no more
I'm recording in LA right now, so the local niggas can't get a verse no more
Sike, I'm still hood rich, still up on that hood shit
Even if I could switch, I don't think I would switch
Always do my own shit, always keep the wood lit
Money and the fame just changed the way I understood shit
And all the time I grew up looking at the gangster rappers
Ain't met a gangsta rapper yet since I became a rapper
I look at myself as a threat and I endanger rappers
Go back and forth bout this and that, oh them my favorite rappers
Indite they self in tweets and shit, them be the lamest rappers
Words behind the internet I don't exchange with rappers
I got some niggas if I say so, they gon change a rapper
Don't mention me, don't shout me out, don't say my name with rappers
I missed that freshman cover twice, like I ain't a factor
And still your favorite rapper's favorite rapper
I'm just a humble nigga can't let nothing get to me
15 I was broke as fuck, rolling up that Swisher Sweet
Love that shit so much, I spent my last and didn't buy shit to eat
Then I hit the bed, it's time for school and I ain't get to sleep
And I got it on my own, niggas ain't give shit to me
They ain't always drop them videos, and always sending beats
I spit that true shit for the street, so fuck it, I remix the Meek
Y'all don't really hear me tho, nah they don't remember me

[Outro]
G Herbo, you already know what it is man 150 Dream Team the campaign
Ball like I'm Kobe the mixtape, never leave my brothers
You already know what it is man, free all my niggas
R.I.P. my niggas man
Working non-stop man, I'm still grinding, ain't no days off man
I don't know what the fuck yall thought
