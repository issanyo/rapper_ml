[Verse 1]
I grew up smart as fuck, bad as shit
But really like the least baddest kid that I was with
'Cause foe nem been wild and shit
Been violent and shit
Been came home from them interrogations, silent shit
Now we fly with felonies and no ID's, private shit
I make money just appear and disappear, magic tricks
I was on some savage shit when I wasn't really havin' shit
I was callin' home from police stations, no one answerin'
I wanted shoes and mom was broke so I ain't even ask her then
I was way too young to hustle, told cuz' let me bag it then

[Chorus]
I was in them trenches every night
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
I gotta get my head right
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my bread right
I'm just tryin' get my head right

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryin' clear my head
Takin' meds, chasin' bread
Got so many niggas dead
And in the feds, you know I got to send them bread
Everything on the outside, all in they head
Other niggas with they bitches, all in they bed
I just tell them think 'bout this, we still on this mission
Tell them rock if you gon' rock but jus' don't block the vision
Just don't plot against me, just don't turn against me
I grew up learnin', listenin', had no problem playing my position
Even if that came with ridin' benches
Just so we make history on our adventures
Just so we have victories in our endeavors
Put my life on line before when I would never
Told myself if you gon' live life, it's now or never

[Chorus]
I was in them trenches every night
I'm just tryn' get my bread right
I'm just tryn' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
I gotta get my head right
I'm just tryn' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my bread right
I'm just tryn' get my head right
