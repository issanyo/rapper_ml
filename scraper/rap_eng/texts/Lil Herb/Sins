[Intro]
I speak the truth, I live the truth, I respect the truth
I respect the grind man
Niggas who be they self you try to force yourself upon some shit that you ain't and you never been
I just can't relate to it, look

[Verse 1]
The rap game kill niggas, literally
It turn gangstas into drag queens
They look down on workin' hard like it's a bad thing
Shit I'm the last man standin' if you ask me
I was just broke not long ago, it feel like last week
Remember niggas in they Benz's ridin' past me
I never hated, used to see that shit as motivation
And I was lost up in the streets, I needed navigation
Ain't wanna be no doctor, lawyer, ended up a patient
Young nigga said, "Fuck Jordans" went and copped a Sauer
Ruth's Chris three times a week, I got tired of Goya
I'm from Chiraq but I got killa niggas in the Nola
Go get that money for tomorrow, fuck who did before ya
Don't put yo focus in this bitches, they just gone destroy ya
Don't put ya trust up in these niggas, man fuck these niggas
Cause when you ain't so beneficial they stop fuckin' witcha

[Hook]
That's why I just be wit my niggas, fuck them other niggas
And every nigga always put they niggas over niggas
But I know my niggas ain't nun like no other niggas
If you ain't grinding, you just hating, you a sucka nigga
No we don't do no Twitter beef, we really in these streets
We ain't trippin' bout no bitches, cause we know they freaks
And we really getting money, but we stay lowkey
If niggas really getting money, they gone let it speak

[Verse 2]
Can you break down your whole grind, and still keep it brief?
Instead of tellin' Instagram what you make a week?
Ten-thou', twenty-thou' that's what you make a week?
On my mother, fly nigga, spend that shit on briefs
Fifty for a pack of three? I spend that shit on tees
Fifty-thou', hunnid-thou'? I spend that shit on jeans
Stunt on me? Lil nigga please, I do this shit with ease
A thousand on my G-Fazo's I don't do Giuse's (Giuseppes)
Still 1500 for my jeans, bitch I love the B's (I love Balmain)
200 for my Backwoods, you know we smokin' P's (Postooo!)
But I ain't tryna stunt my nigga, run it up, Imma run it up
Tryna see 30 with a hunnid-mill, boy I pray to God I don't fuck it up
Couple hunnid-thou', I done fucked it up
Went and got it back told myself "enough"
Had to slow down I was in a rush
Two or three hunnid' always in the cuffs
Spent 500 when I woke up
Young nigga living I ain't give a fuck
Spent 10 thou' like it wasn't nun
Remember them days I ain't have nun
Slide in them foreigns totin' them thirties nigga, we slidin' always stunting
Don't IG none of our cars, can't let niggas know how we comin'
But niggas know how we comin'
No Limit M.B. we drummin'
Pull up, everybody start runnin', know foenem gone hit sumn'
I ain't worried bout none of my enemies, I know I'm gone hit sumn'
I'm on defense, keep that thang wit me, gotta keep on gettin this money
But I know I'm on my way to better days
Some niggas hatin' they wanna see me in my grave
Let me keep that .40, wanna see me in a cage
I jumped off that porch, and knew what was comin I seen it in so many ways
But I knew how to handle myself in the streets I can't let that shit drive me insane
On the 8 we on point for the opps in the morning been at war for so many days
In the cut wit that bitch gotta watch for the Jakes, jumping and hopping the fence
50 shots and we bang, "Jumpout" the Gang, hop out the car wit them tents
And my niggas, they still in the hood everyday
Bitch I'm the only one traveling, tried to tell em to come on the road
All the time, they just wanna stay in the trap wit it. (Haann)

[Hook]
That's why I just be wit my niggas, fuck them other niggas
And every nigga always put they niggas over niggas
But I know my niggas ain't nun like no other niggas
If you ain't grinding, you just hating, you a sucka nigga
No we don't do no twitter beef, we really in these streets
We ain't trippin' bout no bitches, cause we know they freaks
And we really getting money, but we stay lowkey
If niggas really getting money, they gone let it speak

[Outro]
150 Dream Team the Campaign man
I'm focused full fledged, you know what I'm saying
Just on my shit, I ain't too much
Anticipating all this other shit
What niggas got going on
I'm just on my own shit man
Big G Herbo, you already know what it is
