Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
See this in 3D
For life start for me, for life start for me
Thoughts and thoughts to me
80 degrees
Warming up the heat
I did it for you
I did know, indeed
And I run out to sea
I can walk on the water
Honey, I want you
I can float on the finer
Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't
