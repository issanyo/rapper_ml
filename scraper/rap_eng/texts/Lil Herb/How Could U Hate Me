[Intro]
Southside on the track, yeah
I think bout them days when I was like dead broke

[Hook]
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it

[Verse 1]
I the one taught you how to make all of them plays
I'm the one who slept in the trap all them days
I'm the one told you don't stay in your ways
Try go on hits and go miss anyway
Im the one gave you that stick anyway
Im not gon play every anyday
I know me and my niggas the same, we not tryna fall out bout bitches and fame
When it come to gunplay my niggas the same
Run up on one of us, get hit in the brain
Lil killers with me they itching to bang
Reach for some shit you get changed
All of these hundreds, no change at all
I don't rock no more balmain at all
We make a nigga block famous, dawg
Dissing us, we'll have them cases, dawg
True shit, pussy nigga wanna talk shit not he got venom from the blue tips
Ooo shit, coulda had thirty in the Draco, but I'm riding round with a few clips
Still I might riding round jug a few pounds
Brand new engines, they don't make a sound
Used to buy whips to have fun around
Now I just go drive my son around
Shit I be thinking about is should i ride with it less or i  still keep my gun around
Really want war would of thought i was wearing a vest how a nigga just hug around
On 79th till the sun went down
Hundred thugs around
Got love back then, but they hate me now
Showed niggas love back then, gotta pay me now
I'm going brazy now

[Hook]
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it

[Verse 2]
Smoking that shit got me lazy now ay (Posto)
I feel so unstoppable can't nothing faze me now
I fly from the Raq to the tropical
You know i gotta stay low-key like an obstacle
Play with the draco but today i guess the Glock will do
Get up on a nigga ass early like cockadoo
Girl bring that ass here im tryna put a cock in you
Im tryna fuck you then hope in the coupe
Blue Maserati my mood ay
I just put on the Mcqueen and they new
One thousand Dollar my shoe ay
They say im the hottest young nigga in the Chi
Fuck around stay independent till i die
Stacking this money up till it hit the sky
Had a hundred racks 18 i ain't gotta lie
Had a hundred racks 18 why would lie (Bitch)
Nigga i ain't gotta lie
I know my niggas gon fire when i fire
Nigga i ain't bout to die
I watch out for snakes in disguise
See niggas fake in their eyes
Im just out here tryna survive
Murk niggas by allibies
Got racks why would i lie
Tote gats how can i die
Let me know when you ready to ride
Before you shoot nigga look in his eye
?
Im on the grind everyday how could you hate me?
Because i made it

[Hook]
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it
How could you hate me?
How could you hate me?
Why would you hate me?
Oh, cause I made it
