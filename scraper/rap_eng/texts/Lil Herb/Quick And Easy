[Intro]
Look, I'mma do this shit for my muthafuckin' momma...
My sister, my grandmother
Man, all my niggas gone, in jail
Everybody depending on me and shit, man
Y'all don't even understand

[Verse]
All my life I had to fight, that's why I sip the purple
Smoking OG, tryna get to me some Oprah money
Young nigga don't put nothing but family over money
But ain't that funny how your family fuck you over money?
Take the food right out ya mouth like they weren't over Sunday
I spit that real shit, ain't no exaggerations or nothing
I been through it, I get through it, no excuses, just get to it
I get smarter, I go harder, I'm into it
I remember momma mad at me
She found out I was smoking weed
Now when my momma hear my voice outside she know it's me
She never thought I'd get from over east to overseas
But I gotta stay in the states cause I'm still fighting cases
I swear them crackers try they best to bring you back to basics
Don't wanna see you shine, they hate to see you grind
Smile all in ya' face but they can't wait to see you cryin'
No hater, you can't bring me down but yeah, I see you tryin'
I'm in that Hemi flyin', smoking, thinking 'bout my niggas gone and doing time
I keep in touch with my all my niggas, yeah, they doin' fine
Free Gillie, free Maneski, free James, free Bruce, free the gang
Celebratin', all my niggas, we got chains but we ain't changed
Still the same, only thing we see different is the lanes
Niggas switch up just to get to mine
These niggas quick to switch up, I ain't with that picking sides
All my brothers still my brothers, good or bad, right or wrong
We get jammed up, bet my brother do his bid, ride along
That's that shit, I wouldn't trade it for a million bucks
How the fuck you eat with niggas you can't even trust?
It's this bitch named Karma and she mean as fuck
You do enough dirt and watch, the score gon' even up
I'm in the booth, it's 5 AM, you ain't even up
I might not leave till' 9 to 10, I gotta clean it up
This shit too easy, don't believe me? You ain't seen enough
It's G Herbo, I'm the hottest, I'm just being honest
I swear I say that shit so much that I can't even stop it
If I tell you my next move, you can't even stop it
And this bad bitch I'm with look Belizean tropic
They can't keep up, I might start rapping 'bout some easy topics, nigga

[Outro]
Gotta go hard man, PPP
RIP Pistol P man
RIP all my niggas man
Ball Like I'm Kobe the mixtape comin' real soon
You already know man it's just workin' man
Nonstop man, fuck all that fuck shit
Gotta get money, huh
Let the beat sing
