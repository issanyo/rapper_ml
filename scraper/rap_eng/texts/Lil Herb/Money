[Hook: Lil Herb]
Don't try nothing funny cause I know that I look like money
Yo bitch on my dick and she want it
But it's only cause I look like money
My only ambition is money, cause I love it when I look like money
No, you better not play with my money
Fuck around and get killed 'bout that money
She want me cause I look like money
Cause you ain't me and I look like money
These benjis, them franklins, them hundreds
I look so much like money, I'm money
I'm chasing, got my money runnin'
Bitch don't ask me, what I look like money?
Bitch don't ask me for money

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
It's G Herbo, I'm the man
Mr. 'Thumbin' Through Them Bands'
Nothing but hunnids in my pants
Keep it coming 'bout that money, I ain't playin'
I don't want nothing but that money, fuck a friend
I just came up on a couple hunnid bands
Get yo "lemme hold a hunnid if you can"
I put hunnids in my blunts, not a hand
Couple hunnid in my Crush with my mans
Be like twenty something cash in my denim pockets
18 hunnid on my pants and forget about it
And 200 on my dash, so don't get behind me
Smoke on the E-way, man I can't see shit behind me
Can't remember shit but money, so lil' bitch remind me
Besides me, I don't spend my money on shit but family
Don't spend money on no niggas, all my niggas family
And all the niggas that I trust, yeah, they still grimey

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Katie Got Bandz]
Katie Got Bandz
You not talkin' 'bout money, can't hear what you sayin'
Hitters strapped in that van
If you fuck with my money, we clappin' like hands
Robins stuffed with the bands
100's and 50's, you mad your shit empty
Got it on me, don't tempt me
Lil Herb got that ratchet, he blow till it's empty
Spent 10 bands on some red bottoms
Free my nigga Rusty, he a damn shotta
Gold hallows slipping out this chopper
If I hit a opp, he gon' need a damn doctor
Droppin' my set then you got a problem
Katie Got Bandz, so I talk guala
Don't be calling my phone unless it's 'bout dollas
I'm with the team and we balling like we got a sponsor
Bandz!
