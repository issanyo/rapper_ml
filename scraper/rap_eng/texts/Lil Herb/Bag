[Intro]
Ayyy, ayy
150 Dream Team
G Herbo
Haann

[Chorus]
You live then you die, 'til then get the cash
Think about tomorrow nigga, fuck the past
You gon' lose it all tryna fucking flash
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Pray I die wit a bag

[Interlude]
G Herbo, and I done went through 200k man
I ran through that shit already
Tryna go way up and stay up look

[Verse 1]
Like my bro Cap way before rap, bitch I had stupid swag
So let me tell you how I blew a bag
Hit up the mall and spend $10k, don't check no stupid tag
Spent $1,600 on that 8, drunk that shit super fast
They like "Herbo, yo lil' stupid ass"
You better not go broke tryna ball out and stack you a bag
When all them other niggas fall off, best have you a bag
If OG just need sum' to call on, best have you a bag
I got a million things to do wit' cash
Like buy a Masi just to do the dash
And wasn't no silver spoons, all the dishes dirty
So every $50k, I put up 30

[Chorus]
You live then you die, 'til then get the cash
Think about tomorrow nigga, fuck the past
You gon' lose it all tryna fucking flash
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Pray I die wit a bag

{Verse 2]
Go blow that income, save that profit, that's what I'm about $600,000 for my mama house
She tryna own it, watch me knock it out
Time to shove my spending problems down
Plus lawyer fees, cuz' I still ain't put that choppa down
Not even when I'm out of town
Money burning out my pockets when I'm outta town
Told bronem "Just go shopping", when I'm not around
100's, 50's on me in and outta town
I be Louis and Dolce Gabana down
This exclusive shit, Givenchy, it's not around
Rollin' Backwoods and Posto straight out the pound
Smith & Wesson gon' let off a lotta rounds
F-N let off and I won't make not a sound
You can't ball wit me lil nigga, you all out of bounds

[Chorus]
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Think about tomorrow nigga, fuck the past
You gon' lose it all tryna fucking flash
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Pray I die wit a bag
