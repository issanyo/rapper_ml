G herbo
Ay, 150 Dreamteam man you know what it is
Everything foreign all foreign whips all we do is switch lanes

[Hook]

Ay, Money power can't forget about respect
Me and my niggas gon' die for ours
Used to be a Reject bagging up work in that trap for hours
Now i run up free checks staying up late counting racks for hours
Used to rock the bright link 2013 for ride wit sour
Then i copped the Roley seeing what time it is in the shower
Now i might cop the Piguet Nigga i used to be a Reject
Member nights i couldn't get no sleep now i'm up late counting racks for hours

[Verse 1]

Everyday presidential Roley now i might cop the Piguet
Might pull up new Porsche, R8, i8 or i might hop the G Wag
Young nigga stay fresh Balmain pockets full of rubber bands on each side
They remember G Herbo i was selling product toting autos on the Eastside 8 block and the opps gon' stay on they side
They already know how we ride
Might pull up 3 whips Glock 45 hop out niggas getting deep fried
Posted up in the gangway off the apartments nah we don't come from the projects
Pussy boys don't never wanna come where i'm at you will get kidnapped car jacked
Get a pass wit me where you tryna shop at (?)
Know i gotta keep it on me, 30 tatted on me right here next to my Roc tatt or the 40 Glock 22 one hand XD 2 hands this 40 compact
Riding round wit my guys said might as well get high already gone off contact
Kobe turned me on to lean i turned me on to paper
Said watch the ones you call your own turn on your owner haters
I see niggas when they smiling i catch on to fakers
But they know they better not start wildin i got chrome for takers
I don't wanna pay no rent i'm tryna own a acre
Yeah i own my own my estate i ain't used to own a Sega
Young nigga got a Visa now i ain't talking chasers
Im talking if i wanted own my own home in Jamaica
Them packs gone touch down guaranteed from Hong Kong to Jamaica
Them packs gone land insurance me when i'm home from Jamaica
I Call up Zues he bring the heat when i'm all in Jamaica
And if you pay that extra fee it get flown on the daily
This rap shit taught me a lot of things Good and Bad
Ups and Downs i been a lot of places
I done met a lot of folks i made a lot of faces
Mean i done met a lot of folks i seen a lot of faces
Different cities in the club throwing money popping Aces
Spending racks Dolce shirt go with this Prada cases
Dead white folks on me now but i am not a racist
And my bitch straight from the island she's not a basic
She don't speak no english she just loves a reject

[Hook]

Ay, Money power can't forget about respect
Me and my niggas gon' die for ours
Used to be a Reject bagging up work in that trap for hours
Now i run up free checks staying up late counting racks for hours
Used to rock the bright link 2013 for ride wit sour
Then i copped the Roley seeing what time it is in the shower
Now i might cop the Piguet Nigga i used to be a Reject
Member nights i couldn't get no sleep now i'm up late counting racks for hours
