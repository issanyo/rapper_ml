[Intro]

[Hook: K.M. tha Original]

These niggas ain't getting no money & I'm like why is that
I'm looking for brain from bitches not snitches with wire taps
These jeans cost more than 150 don't ask me how fly is that
You know that I come from the city where I gotta watch my back
I'm like why is that
Why is that
Why is that why is that
Why is that
You know that I'm come from ms windy (watch my back)
Why is that
Why is that


[Verse 1: K.M. tha Original]

I'm getting this money they see me count up
And them niggas like why is that
They see me in foreigns they see me pull up
And them niggas like how is that
I got at yo girl and she gave me her number
But I ain't never call or text
I get it and smash it you cuffing arresting
Now tell me whats wrong wit that
I spit stupid like a two year old
Y'all snooze on the flow with out a sleeping bag
They hate hard
I'm like why is that, they blind as hell
Won't ever see the cash
K.M. tha Original
Get my letters straight I love to make 'em mad
With real niggas who authentic
No pepper spray just guns and cash
Got a smart girl with the dumbest ass
I'm still tryna find out her tongue is at
I'm a Scorpio you know what come with that
Lil' freaky shit to keep ya running back
And
You lames is clueless I Stacy dash to
The banks like Hillary
You really be making me cripple you visually
I be splitting these
Atomic flows precisely with symmetry
Please do not mimick me
Niggas be gimmicky
Finicky talking bout how they gone injure
Me silly lil' industry
Wanna be little gs with little G's
And little cheese nigga please
I be too busy to tell you I'm busy
Chase dollar bills till a nigga get dizzy
So either you with me or you not comin wit me
& If you not wit me then I am not tripping
I come from the city that they call ms windy
Hot in the winter niggas walking with semis
Sorry for The misunderstandings y'all lil' boys
And I'm Peyton manning
Right now I'm manning
Respect demanded
I'm not from this world
And I'm out of this planet
But why is that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]

My city filled with murders and killers
But why is that
Cause ain't no more jobs
The kids is starving
And everyone tryna' rap
My city the murder cap, it ain't gone change
Cause everyone gotta gat
And everyone tryna clap
On the internet
Ain't no one tryna trap
Now please tell me why is that
Why my city copy cats
If trapping is dead G Herbo gone bring it back
Bet you they copy that
Smokin' pack to the head
And sippin' on lean I hope my lungs don't collapse
Because [?] we got macks with the beams
You know my lil' bro gone clap
Yeah I'm living my dream, I'm counting' these hunnids
And ridin' in low lows now
But I'm still the same nigga
I'm wit' the same niggas Deeko let that 4 4 clap
I be riding and sipping' and fucking off digits
I don't give a ho my time
10K for a show, 5K for verse and post up like Im on the grind
No 9 to 5 G Herbo punching in for over time
Don't know what you do to your opps when you see 'em
But bitch I stand over mine
I round in them hondas and buicks
Well bitch now its rari and rover time
[?] free wet 'em up bitch we need 'em back on the nine
