[Verse 1]
I grew up just a fucking screw up
I'm talking way before the money, when a nigga blew up
I'm talking nothing in my stomach, water what I threw up
I came from under, in that gutter, where it rain manure
Where don't nobody want a future, all the shorties shooters
But you can't judge that young man just by what he doing
You don't understand the circumstances, how he group up
He ain't never had a father, watched his momma toot up
I came up with them hot boys, everybody knew us
15, 16, niggas tryna' do us
Can't trust a soul cause for that cash yo niggas turn to Judas
I'm telling you the truth, my nigga, cause I really do this
Now Herbo always on the road, I guess I'm a tourist
Scream my name at all my shows, I guess I'm the truest
Let me stop acting like I don't know, yes, I'm the truest
To put this rap game in a choke hold, yes, I'm the newest
But still that youngin' from the bottom, started off with nothing
And now I'm all about my dollas all across the country
I'm working hard because I'm starvin' and you niggas lunch meat
I get respect in every city, dare a nigga touch me, i's gon get ugly
I was hateful now I'm living lovely, it's marvelous
Everybody screamin' "gang", but they don't know who started it
That's a shame how my city the same, some fucking followers
Keep the fame and don't mention my name, unless your dollars up
Nigga

[Verse 2]
Free my homies, a couple doing almost life in that shitter
Life ain't shit, and they bitch getting piped by they niggas
I know niggas that got they life snatched right by they niggas
You think he got his life back cause no fight from his niggas
Fuck niggas, don't do right by they niggas at all
I get jammed up, believe I know what niggas to call
I know my niggas that's gon ride, I know which niggas gon' fall
But sad to say, I know I just can't fuck with niggas at all
Jumped off the porch and then I hit the block, the rest was history
They murdered Roc and ever since the street shit just been into me
And for Kobe Squad it's fuck the opps, kill all my enemies
To ease the pain I pour up eights of lean and pints of Hennessy

[Outro]
"Ball Like I'm Kobe" the mixtape man
Free all my niggas man
R.I.P. all my niggas man
This real shit right here man, this real shit
150 Dream Team the campaign man
