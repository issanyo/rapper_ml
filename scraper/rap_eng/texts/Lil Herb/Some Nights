[Intro]
Scared I wasn't gon' make it home some nights
Wondering am I gon' be a homicide
Kill you quick if I decide
Crazy, guess I get that from my mama side
Niggas beef with us, don't even come outside
30 in the Glock, I keep that on my side
Ain't no questioning, my nigga, I'ma ride (Southside)
Out there like some monkey bars, I'ma slide
I know one day I'ma die
Made some millions for my son so I'm aight
And I'm in that Bentley truck that's parked right outside
I know one day I'ma die, but right now I'm alive
Need a purple heart for the shit that I survived
Better be alert if ever you and I collide
And I ain't limiting myself
This shit, I gotta strive
It look like a light show when I arrive (ChopsquadDJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

[Verse]
Straight up out the trenches
Had to squeeze that bitch at least one time
Me and all my niggas
We was young and dumb, I ain't know how to fucking listen
So pay attention, hopefully I get to teach you different
All you young niggas wild 'til you meet the district
He ain't even get due process and this nigga snitching
Get around a nigga like me and they turn bitches
He ain't never did no street shit, I see through him instantly
Gotta take everything come with this shit or you gon' be like that
Gotta have that bail money, gotta be ready to fight that
Blood ties with my niggas, I got shot with Project
Mally, he was with me too but we did dirt on top of that
My left pocket, wasn't no phone in it, had my baby Glock in there
Summer Jam in front of 20,000, I wish Roc was there
Seen't you in there witcho bop, you know I got the top from her
Anyway, that's off the topic
We talking 'bout them blocks, shootouts, and Glocks
So what about the opps?
Shit, what 'bout the opps?
Shit, what 'bout they bops?
What pop out they top?
Gang, you know how we rock
In clubs, am I not?
At shows, am I not?
Iced up, am I not?
Amiri's with knots
I ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is plot
I'm ready when you are
Riding back to back, two blacks
We like the mini bar
Love the shots, keep one up tops
Send them bitches in any car
Ayy, ayy
And I'm on the E-way like Andretti, my new car
Loaded like I'm ready for armageddon
Boy, I came too far to let a nigga take me out this shit
Now he a star
Nigga make me a block
Nigga make me a bar
I'm all in his raps, smoke him and his cigar
I know a nigga so cold, he shoot at the opps out his sister car
And it's over, bitch
Our life ain't worth that pussy boy
Know you been getting played out all yo life, you pussy boy
2Pac told you first, "I ain't no killer, but don't push me", boy
So don't push me, boy
You know I'm gon' pull it boy
Here go a bullet, I ain't a bully
My auto fully
I rep that No Limit shit to the fullest
Hop out in public, I'm thinking 'bout leaving the blick out
I'ma tote my lil' shit in a hoodie
Came up from nothing, I still can't believe I'm legit
Everywhere I go I'm the shit
Been out here swaggin' like I'm that nigga ever since I was six
Ain't gotta ask a nigga for shit 'cause I'm fucking rich
Ain't nobody give me nothing
Want a handout? Suck a dick
Bitch
