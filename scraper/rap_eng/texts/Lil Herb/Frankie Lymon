[Intro]
"I'll call the cops!"
"Yeah baby, you call the police and tell them we got two imposters up here running a scam because I'm Ms. Frankie Lymon!"
"I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon!" "I am Mrs. Frankie Lymon"
"Jesus Christ, it's a God damn game show!"
Gang! Ballin' Like I'm Kobe the mixtape

[Bridge]
They like "Herbo you so fly", that's everywhere I go
They like "Herbo you so high", and I'm like "yeah I know"
I keep .45 on my side, man you know I can't go
Niggas plotting, I know they mad cause I got all these rolls

[Hook]
All these hoes, all these clothes, all these jewels
All these drugs, all my niggas, all these tools
All these bitches over me, they don't want you
Hunned-fifty with me, run up, they gon' shoot
All my diamonds, I be shinin'
Presidential Rollie, it say timeless
All I know is hustle, I be grindin'
If you looking for me, you can find me

[Verse 1]
If you looking you can find me on the 8 block me and all my niggas grindin'
"Herbo, whats been happening since the tape dropped?" Me and all my niggas shinin'
Wrist cost me bout a brick still look on my phone to see what time is
And my fit cost a couple G's, I can see a deal before I sign it
All these bitches over me, I feel like Frankie Lymon
I'm so high, I may O.D, I feel like Frankie Lymon
I might spend a couple grand a week and stack enough to buy a couple diamonds
I might buy my sis a couple 'fits if she get an A on her assignment
I'm a young nigga, I'm a businessman, I take care of business, man
And I and a slap a bitch in a minute, man, so yes, I'm a minuteman
Keep my pistol on me everywhere I go, don't give a fuck about no sentence, man
Off the drink you know it got me moving slow, I'm leaning like I'm trynna kick a stand

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2]
Sippin' drank, smokin' pack, wishin' I could get my niggas back
Rollin' up the thrax, pour a hi-tech, but I really miss the act
Fuck a nigga bitch, then I give her back
Don't want her to get attached
A nigga shoot at me, bitch I'm shooting back
Make sure you remember that
I don't gotta worry bout who finna' blow, all my niggas into that
I don't look at tags, while I'm in the store, all I do is spend a sack
I don't trip about it, I'm a hustler, I know I'mma get it back
20's, 50's, 100's, Herbo thumbin' through a check
Want a feature? Hit my jack, I ain't hoppin' on it if it's wack
Fuck a industry catch me in the streets, might not send your money back
And my gun up on me if a nigga run up on me, he ain't running back

[Bridge + Hook]
