[Intro: 'LGado]
Okay, bitch, ayy

[Verse 1: 'LGado]
I'm jumpin' out my Jordans
You ain't see me hoppin' out my car
Okay, cool
Hey bra, I saw you from far away
Uh, shout out to my pop, this shit gon' fall in place
Ayy, they see your lil boy
Uh, I couldn't even tell him Happy Father's Day
I'm runnin' shit out here, they gon' do what I say
Now, I got bitches out here like Beyoncé

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
And I feel you got just had a lil boy
Got his future mapped like I’m Lavar, ayy (ball)
And you know I cap, I'm cappin' hard
And I get the strap like I know Lloyd Banks
And I come from apartments, 'bout to move to LA
And I'ma cop me a AP Skeleton on my b-day
If it's 'bout a check, I'm runnin' through traffic, whatever, I'd never be late
And for my respect, kill whoever for that, bitch I'm EBK

[Verse 3: 'LGado]
I'ma keep it 1k, lotta shit don't faze me (okay)
Uh, me and Herb in the stu' right now and we goin' crazy
Love my lil niggas, how am I gon' replace 'em? (okay)
Uh, [?] ass onwards to Jamaica
What they say?
I need a lil bitch from Barbados
Keep silent, it's potato, we turn 'em into tomatoes
Soon I get tired of home, probably take my shit to Vegas
Be hurry up and weight it, hurry up and get the safe

[Verse 4: G Herbo]
It's 6AM, my nose stopped up but I'm still smokin' wood
I know they bad but they make me feel good
Your bitch bad but she make me feel good
I popped a Percocet, they made heal good
Ridin' fast, and she got a fat ass
Handle mine, I'm ready for that, bet I get the last laugh
Still ain't got no life, see light, flash, smash
Niggas all on my dick, they hatin' on me 'cause I get it fast, cash

[Verse 5: 'LGado]
See 12s, I'm smashin', the bitch think I'm smashin' her
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm cashin', to be fresher than a mannequin
Call up [?], I come make a mess, no napkin
Ooh, I'm countin' cabbage, ooh, that boy fantastic
She gon' call a cab, because I ain't drivin'
I ain't got the tab on me, I ain't finna cry
I'm gon' do the dash in it, that's why I ain't tryin'
I feel like 'Pac in this shit too, but I ain't dyin'
Coolin' when I'm ridin', crusin', I ain't hidin'
They gon' try find me, they ain't gotta try
Act like I ain't ridin' with that Tony Montana
Clip look like banana, you know I ain't lyin'
