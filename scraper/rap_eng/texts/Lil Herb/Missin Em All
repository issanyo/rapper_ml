[Intro]
Everybody asking me to tell them my story but i don't know where to begin
Everybody asking me to tell them my story but i don't know where to begin
Cause too many people outta my life i'm conscious of letting them in

[Hook]

Back when I was in the streets told myself when I leave I won't miss it at all
And I lost some people in my life meant so much to me i'm missin them all
I was running the streets wit my dawgs, I got niggas and family gone
R.I.P yeah i'm missin them all, now you see me i do it for yall'
R.I.P missin my uncle gone, R.I.P missin my auntie gone
R.I.P man my grandpapa gone, all my niggas I can't name them all
Through the madness i'm still standing tall
I been losing my homies since I was 15 thats the reason I know that i'm strong
Thats the reason they live through my songs

[Verse 1]

[?] I be stressed but counting my blessings I wish I could just fly away
Thats the reason I woke up and got high today
And I know niggas just gotta hate, but go count you a check
Why you watching how I calculate, Lot of school mornings I never ate
They ain't wonder if I had a plate, imma go get me some anyway, Shit as long as my lil sister straight
If you got it and ain't have to go through the grind niggas like us will never relate
I be on the go I never break, for the paper I don't hesitate
Kobe said on the 9 one day better grind till your time you gon' shine one day
Never thought he'd see me crying one day
And ill never go to church on sundays, I was posted right there on the one way
But god still with me like its sunday, with my Glock 40 like a gunplay
And I know that it might sound crazy but alot of days niggas could of blazed me
Murder rate like the 90's and 80's, but this my lifestyle I can't let it faze me
Gotta talk to my momma all the time, She be on the phone saying that im crazy, know I keep the hammer on me all the time
I can't lie if i tried its cause she raised me
She tell me she proud of me all the time, I just wanna see her smile all the time
Remember I was in the streets I was wildin, thought i knew everything I was challenged
Committing violence
East and Stoney Island
Ay

Back when I was in the streets told myself when I leave i won't miss it at all
