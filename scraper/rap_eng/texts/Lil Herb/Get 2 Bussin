[Hook: Lil Bibby]
I'm gone get this money, that's on everything
I just hit the trap and sold everything
Pussy niggas talk and ain't know anything
Married to the money need a wedding ring
And when it comes to bitches, I don't trust 'em
I fuck her then I pass her to my brother
Police ass niggas with that cuffin'
Try to run up on us, we gon get to bussin'

[Verse 1: Lil Herb & Lil Bibby]
Ay, niggas hatin', I say fuck 'em
Met a bitch I really like, but I don't love her
Ay, niggas workin' under cover, ay
Got a bid now you tellin' on your brother, ay
You lil dirty motherfucker, ay
Them yellow tips open him up, ketchup and mustard, ay
I put them killers on your ass, fuck nigga owe me cash
See them blue lights, I'mma smash 200 on my dash
Ay, Balmains, two racks on my ass
Hella skrilla in my pockets, my shit look like pads
Ay, I like my money and my bitches fast
If that bitch ain't bad, Steve Nash, I'mma pass
I'mma addict, smoking weed, hash, dip and dab
You can't name a hoe that we ain't smash, your bitch is trash
I'm in Miami popping bottles don't pass me no glasses
Smoking dope hop out the 'Rari carpet full of ashes
Ay, I got a .40 and that bitch plastic
I just bought a Desert Eagle, I can't wait to blast it
Everything I do illegal, bitch I ain't no pastor
Leanin' hard, I got my seatbelt on cause I be crashin'

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I just went on my last bitch and fucked her buddy
Dropped two zips in a rootbeer now my shit muddy
I used to save my dubs up to reach 100
Now when I run them bands up, at least a 100
And I came from nothin'
Used to share clothes and my bro, niggas thought it was funny
Now my shirt Givenchy
My belt Louie V and my boxers Versace
And I am not in the Illuminati
For my birthday I might just pull up in a Tesla or a brand new Maserati
