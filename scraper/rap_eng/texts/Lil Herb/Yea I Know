[Intro]
My feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground
And it feels like I can see the sins on the horizon
Every time you are not around I slowly drift away

[Hook]
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cause they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go
But that's the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
This the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
So you wanna be a dope boy, yeah I know
You ain't fuckin' with no broke boys, yeah I know
So you wanna put the grind in, yeah I know
Catch a case do your time, yeah I know
Pussy niggas gon' hate, yeah I know
And real street niggas gon' always relate, yeah I know
I'ma be great, yeah I know

[Verse]
Yeah I know, yeah I know
Used to post on the 8-block, I was dead broke and they missed that, yeah I know
Niggas stunted on me, tryna flex on me, now it's mix-match, yeah I know
Niggas down talked me, I'm a bitch nigga this, I'ma get whacked, yeah I know
Keep somethin' on me for the get back, click-clack, shit's splat, yeah I know
Young nigga got AK's, 10 Glocks, little Jocks, big Macks, GI Joe
They ain't believe, thought I wasn't gon' be shit, be rich, yeah I know
Never gave me shit, got it all on my own, nigga G shit, yeah I know
I smoke me 2-3 to the dome soon as I'm alone
Just thinkin' bout my life I'm happy that I made it home
Cause Lord knows I've been doin' wrong out there all day long
But Lord knows that I'm just tryna put all of my people on
Lord knows I got some issues, miss all of my people gone
Long live King Cap I miss you wish you could just hit my phone
How you used to pull up on me, pour it up, let's get it on
When the oz's smokin' blunts of OG, we just flip and gone
Gotta watch for cops, tryna duck them high speeds, know we got the chrome
Why you couldn't just have your chrome on that day? Man I miss you dawg
Know we down here rockin' out, no talkin', you know you my dawg
Yeah you was my nigga and they ain't know you like I knew you dawg
Matter of fact most of these niggas really ain't know you at all
Niggas out here talkin' runnin' they mouth like you wouldn't shoot it off
Niggas out here ridin' on they high horse like you ain't shoot it all
Like you wasn't out ridin' round with that torch tryna get
No Limit that score
Like you wasn't out five pipes
In that Porsche through the opps, niggas just bored
Might as well lay it out there on the table now since you ain't here no more
I lost my bro right before my tape was out
Young nigga goin' crazy now
Stackin' books got the shit comin' in by the pages now
Got me feelin' like I made it now
Made a way out some shit then fucked around and made a habit
Stayed focus then I made it happen
Even through Chiraq I be ridin' round crazy
Ratchets, got me wishin' that I stayed in Cali
Ever since that day and even before, hit a bitch everywhere I go
But ever since that day I think of you tellin' me I need that
Yeah I know, yeah I know

[Hook]
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cuz they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go
But that's the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
This the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
So you wanna be a dope boy, yeah I know
You ain't fuckin' with no broke boys, yeah I know
So you wanna put the grind in, yeah I know
Catch a case do your time, yeah I know
Pussy niggas gon' hate, yeah I know
And real street niggas gon' always relate, yeah I know
I'ma be great, yeah I know
