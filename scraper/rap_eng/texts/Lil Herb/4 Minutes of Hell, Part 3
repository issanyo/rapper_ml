[Verse 1]
My hunger is equal to my struggle
I came from nothin'
Grindin' then I made it to somethin'
The age of a youngin'
Started hangin' and bangin' and hustlin'
Exchangin' the customs
To make it in this dangerous jungle
In a treacherous war
People dying, nobody crying
All the shit that I saw
You expect me to sit on the porch?
Every moment is yours
Freeze up and you fall by the torch where I'm from
Better not fumble in the city I'm from
Homicides on a Sunday in the city I'm from
Young nigga, always hanging wit them older guys
We was bangin', slangin' all the white
But we ain't Oberweis
Fantasizing, tryna be that trap nigga
Can't get to the money
We too busy tryna clap niggas
Standing on that block, where my mama told me
"Boy don't go right there"
But I was by that store right there
Learned everything I know right there
Me and broski, brought me to the block
He showed me the work, and he sold me the work
But nobody never told me to work
I used to post up, talk shit and tote guns
While we smoke blunts
We knew the price if we gon' live this life
But we like so what
Cause no one gon' make a way for none of us to come up
But I'm tryna make a way for every one of us to come up
When the sun rise I roll a philly up, and load the semi up
By 9 o'clock  I'm drinkin' double cups and gettin' paper cuts
We savin' up, sittin' on this money
Now it's raisin' us. We trained to buss
You can run dog, that's what this laser for
I think I need to, take a breather
Cause I'm hot as fever
I'm about to bring some type of demon
Right up outta me
Cause I been feelin' like you pussy niggas tryna plot on me
That's why I keep this Glock on me
Plus I got all this guap on me
But way before the flex you still could catch me
On that block out east
Lost my homies, now I feel like God just dropped a rock on me
But I won't stop, I can't stop
Gotta go hard, till my rate drop
Spittin' all this fire make my face hot
Now I can't wait till my tape drop
And I'm still up on the 8 Block
Late night me and J. Dot
Better think twice for you ride past
Let the 9 blast now the Jakes hot
I was bout to take a rest but
Smoke told me, "Bro it ain't no let ups"
So I'm working hard like I'm in the pros
Make a nigga bitch lick my sweat up
She suckin' dick and I just met her
She know a nigga next up
She hope I don't neglect her
And she know I don't respect her
And I might forget my sweater
But never leave the house without Berettas
Still the same nigga from the gangway
Tryna flip a ounce into a Phantom
Catch me doing shows filling stands up
You know the gang turn the fans up
And you know we got them cans tucked
Hope nobody don't get blammed up
I be leanin' I can't stand up
And this bitch asked me why my jeans sag
Cause they tryna hold my bands up
Heard somebody wanna rob me
Well you bett' not give ya chance up
2 seats in the 50 shot
I just hope I don't get jammed up
And this 50 bett' not jam up
I seen niggas get in jams and
They ain't even stay to pick they mans up
I seen niggas shakin' hands
Then make the same niggas put they hands up
I seen niggas change and changed
Niggas that was cool since the sandbox
So I gotta keep my head up
16 and I got one head up
And ion talk, I let the gun talk
And she don't never really understand nothin'
Let a fuck nigga ask somethin'
Give a fuck nigga every one
Gave my young niggas couple .38s
And some shells let em have fun
Young niggas spend a lot of cash
Cause growing up I never had none
I'm like, "Oh I gotta get me some"
Cause being broke wasn't any fun
We got choppers for everyone
Who want problems with anyone
I be tired of tryna tell y'all niggas
Where a nigga really comin' from
And why a nigga gotta go hard
Cause ion really come from nothin'
And I never been a runner up
Cause it ain't nobody runnin' us
And Lil Mally got that sit em down
If somebody ever runnin' up
Imma always bond them killas out
What'chu think I got them hunnids for?
Crazy James just knocked his sentence out
Yeah the state done let a menace out
So I'm showing up at my nigga house
Like the cop that move the tenants out
I see lil niggas want some Twitter clout
But I ain't tryna put ya business out
