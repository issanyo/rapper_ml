[Intro]
Uh huh
Aye
Damn, hol' on
What the fuck? Who the fuck is this?
Hol' on
Aye
Aye

[Verse 1]
â€‹iPhone goin' off
Press decline, hit the power button just to throw it off
Annoyin' ass lil' bitch keep texting me
I hate a know-it-all
I hit bitches ASAP on the first night I don't know at all
And if you think this shit got them sick, wait 'til I show it all
50K, I put that on my wrist, ain't have no glow at all
Plain Jane, sky dweller
Get that money now or never
Got that check, you know I'm gangster
What I go do? Go buy a bezel
And I'm out here by my lonely
One up on me, niggas can't get one up on me
Run up on me, ain't gotta cock it, one up on me
Get a little cocky, big bro told me "Nigga, you chosen"
Bad enough I say "I'm broke," everybody be like "Nigga you hoeing"
I can't lie, I'm holdin'
I can't fold it, rubber band to hold it
Now I'm out in [La Postolle?] rollin', in my flipflops strollin'
Still got paranoia, I'm off Fairfax lookin' off my shoulder
Book me for a show, I ain't gon' go unless you get my pole in

[Chorus]
Bitches love me
'Cause they love gangsters
Gettin' money
This that Palm Angels
This a hurdle
Issa 30
It's Lil Herbo
Two door, swervin'
Aye, aye
And I have my way
Aye, aye
And I have my way
Aye, aye
And I have my way
And I have my way
Yeah, I have my way

[Verse 2]
Aye, bitch I have my way
Yeah I drive i8s
And I'm still slammin' rakes
Still'll take fly on the jakes
Let a fuck nigga try and invade my home
Chopper shell right in the face
I secure my chain like a iPhone
Fingerprint right on the safe
Got girl scouts straight from the bay
Gucci shirt came from the A
Used to sip lean by the case
Thought it make the pain go away
I was high, fuck around, caught a case
Then them fights still ain't go away
So far I gave my lawyer 8K, but that shit I make that rain in a day
Bitches love me
'Cause they love gangsters
I bought all of that Balmain, this that Palm Angels
She got all of that jaw game, swallow all I came
These hoes be actin' like they thang but they all basic

[Chorus]
Bitches love me
'Cause they love gangsters
Gettin' money
This that Palm Angels
This a hurdle
Issa 30
It's Lil Herbo
Two door, swervin'
Aye, aye
And I have my way
Aye, aye
And I have my way
Aye, aye
And I have my way
And I have my way
Yeah, I have my way
