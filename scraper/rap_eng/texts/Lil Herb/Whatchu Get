[Intro]
Look, When you out here playing this street shit man
What you see ain't always whatchu get
Main thing, don't panic, keep yo head up
R.I.P. them niggas, R.I.P. big squad
Lets get it, GANG!

[Hook]
Imma tell you this, what you see ain't always whatchu get
So when you out here in these streets can't never trust no bitch
Stay in that trap and work your wrist, you just might get rich
You think that work was Jesse White the way I make it flip
In the streets I learned some shit that I can't forget
Rule number 1 don't never snitch you know what they get
Rule number 2 worry about you, don't owe nobody shit
And remember this, what you see ain't always whatchu get

[Verse 1]
Imma tell you this what you see ain't always whatchu get
Cause I saw that light right before my eyes, but they ain't hit shit
Remember all them nights, totin' all them pipes to protect my life
Imma ride for the squad, even when it ain't right, to protect my stripes
Mad Max goin right from the block to the opps, now he right by mikes
Hammers cocked 30 shots coming out that Glock, when he drop take flight
And you know for Lil Roc we ain't never gon stop, till we all on top
Veto city, Roc block, fuck all of the opps, we gon' put em all in a box
Bout 200+ eyeballs on the block, and we all gotta watch
Seem like you can't post up at all with the jocks, niggas calling the cops
Shit'll never be the same, if hit another stain, imma spend it all on a watch
Lil shit on your instagram don't mean nothing bruh, is you balling or not?
Yeah enough of the flexin', niggas duck from the weapons, I'm calling the shots
Teaching suckers a lesson, give they bitches a blessing through all of my guap
And these nothing ass hoes got y'all niggas stressing, man it all gotta stop
Ya bitch all on my jock, won't believe what she did when she saw all my knots

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If she know about you way before you meet her, then that bitch a eater
First week she want you to meet all her peoples, don't trust them either
Lowkey around you, hope her nigga don't see her, fuck around and beat her
Know I got that heater, I ain't worried bout nothing, I'm just puffing reefer
You can catch me in the hood, niggas think it's all good
But I don't trust them neither
Couple G's on me, and if I wanted to shit, I could drop it on my sneakers
And I gotta get rich, cause this money ain't shit
Like I'm just working on features
And I don't owe you shit, you ain't ride for my clique
Nigga you ain't tote them heaters
If you play the other team we'll have your momma crying, walking on my bleachers
You can't walk in my sneakers, you ain't from where I'm from
You don't rock with my peoples, and they don't rock you neither
You ain't been where I been, you ain't did what I did
When I pull up in the shit, I'm a made nigga sick, they can't spit what I spit

[Hook]
