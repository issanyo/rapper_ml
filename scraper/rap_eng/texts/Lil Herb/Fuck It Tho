[Intro]
I've Just Been Waking Up To All My Problems And Shit
Just Like Fuck It, Fuck Everything
Not Even On No Nonchalant Shit. Just Like Alright, I'm A Let Life Deal With Itself (Fuck that Shit Man)
I Ain't Forcing Shit (You Know)
It Is What It Is
& Everything Happens For A Reason If You Ask Me
G Herbo, Check It

[Verse 1]
Life Priceless, Life Precious
100 Fuck Ups From My Decisions Taught Life Lessons
It Ain't Genuine & Authentic. No I Don't Respect It
If That Man Action Raises Suspicion, Don't Neglect It
Translate My Situation So You Get The Messages
Let It Digest
You Might Just Feel The Anger In My Chest
So Much Stress
I Just Play My Game Like Chess
Stay Humble And Bless
God Handle The Rest, But I Still Keep The Weapon on Me
None The Less
So I'm I Still Able To Say I'm Watch By The Eyes Of The Lord?
Might As Well Put Up A Fight If I'm Gon Die By The Sword
It's Roll Or Get Rolled Over And The Street Choice Is Yours
That's The Drama I Been Tryna Avoid
But Fuck It Though

[Hook]
Blew A Quarter Ticket 'fore I Turned 20, Fuck It Though
Fuck Up 20, 30 Grand Wit My Mans, Fuck It Though
And Of Course I've Seen My Last, Bounce Back Like Fuck It Though
Tryna Run My Bands Up And Always Go Fucking Broke
My Mother Ran Them Bills Alone Like Ak But Fuck It Though
20, 30k A Show Did 8 Straight Got 30 More
Making Love To The Money, Count It Up And Fucked It Though
And she Say She Like Me As A Person, I Don't Trust Her Though

[Verse 2]
Spend A Check Like Fuck It Though
But I Can't Lie, I Love It Though
Had 200, Made 250, Got 300 More
Started Rapping I Was 15, I was 18 On The Road
I Remember I Had Funny Money, It Was Running Low
I Can't Lie On Any Track I Rap, No I'm Not One Of Those
It Was Nice Thought To Myself I Felt Like I Was Running Cold
Mama Bills And Auntie Bills, Still In The Field, Not In The Hills
How The Fuck I'm Feeling Broke? & I Just Did A 100 Shows
Spend Nights In The Trap Selling Coke
Making Diamonds In The Hood Wrapping Soap
I'm Just Tryna Re-up Fuck It Though
I'm Just Tryna Be Up Fuck It Though
And My Grandmom Died A Year Ago Before She Did I Remember She Told Me
"Go Platinum, We Don't Do Gold" Now My Heart So Cold
And My Concerts Sold Nigga

[Hook]
Blew A Quarter Ticket Fore I Turned 20, Fuck It Though
Fuck Up 20, 30 Grand Wit My Mans, Fuck It Though
And Of Course I've Seen My Last, Bounce Back Like Fuck It Though
Tryna Run My Bands Up And Always Go Fucking Broke
My Mother Ran Them Bills Alone Like Ak But Fuck It Though
20, 30k A Show Did 8 Straight Got 30 More
Making Love To The Money, Count It Up And Fucked It Though
And She Say She Like Me As A Person, I Don't Trust Her Though
