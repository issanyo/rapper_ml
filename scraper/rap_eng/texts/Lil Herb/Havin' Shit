[Intro]
G Herbo.... G HERBO!!

[Hook]
Niggas know that I been havin' shit
Know that I've been havin' shit
Blow a hunnid K, on a habit bitch
Waitin' for a nigga to try some shit
Niggas know that I've been savage bitch
A hunnid shot can in my mattress
I been gettin' hoes, riding foreigns
And countin' all this dough, cause I been tourin'
Like 20, 30 shows, just got some more rich
Count up and count some more, it's never boring

[Verse 1]
BITCH, IT'S G HERBO!!
Yeah, I know you know me
I be gettin' dough
I been tourin, remember
I was poor that had to be at least 7 years ago
At 14 we was out there on that savage shit
In the hood we beat niggas snatching, smashing shit
Now I might be in LA smoking that Cali shit (Pasto)
Up in Barney fucking up the Mcqueen and I'm just
Buying shit
15 racks in my Balmain you can see it poking
40 tuck so tight don't even look like I got it on me
Stay in your lane you a fuck nigga, no you not my homie
I don't got nothing for no nigga I just got it on me

[Hook]
Niggas know that I been havin' shit
Know that I've been havin' shit
Blow a hunnid K, on a habit bitch
Waitin' for a nigga to try some shit

I been gettin' hoes, riding foreigns
And countin' all this dough, cause I been tourin'
Like 20, 30 shows, just got some more rich
Count up and count some more, it's never boring

[Verse 2]
Look 2015 I did like 120 shows
I'll pop a 65, 10,10,10,10,10K
I was sipping on drank
Blowing off stank, fucked off 50K
And when I went broke, I saw my last
I dont know what to say
I didn't do no crying, got off my ass, ran up a 100K
I had that money running laps like I'm late
Them packs were outta town, I don't remember her name
By the time my 18th birthday I was up a 100K
Rubber band up at my momma house
I don't have no fucking bank
I remember my sophomore high school teacher said what I couldn't make
She made like 24 a year, my Bezel 38 (BITCH!)
