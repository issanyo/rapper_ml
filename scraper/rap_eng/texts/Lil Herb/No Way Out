[Intro]
Uhh, I'm from a place where they don't make it out
Haann, haann
Me and my niggas tryna' make it out
True story, look

[Verse 1]
Grew up with them goblins, we all came from the trenches
Young niggas lived, learned lessons, we ain't wanna listen
We just was wildin', having fun, and made some bad decisions
But we was runnin' shit, No Limit, we ain't have to listen
I was like fifteen, remember I had the coldest winter
We lost Lil Roc in February, White Folks was November
This was my freshman year of high school, we was just beginners
Skipped breakfast, woke up sliding, loading pipes for dinner
This all I knew, pop out, all my niggas wanna do
Felt like a obligation, did what we was 'pose to do
G Faro lost his bro, I seen it drill a hole in you
Said to myself, "No matter what, I'll always roll with you"
I'll always ride with you, pull up, homicide with you
And for my brothers, it's whatever, 150 forever
No Limit tats on us forever, got that shit together
We only tryna find the money, we ain't folding, never

[Interlude]
I look at myself as like the blueprint for my niggas
Really just, you know what I'm saying, showing the way
Of how to make shit better, not even a way out
Cause we young niggas, you know what I'm saying?
We in this shit together
And really with me being in the streets and all that shit
Everything that happened in my life I ain't never prayed
Or you know, nothing like that for no way out or
To change what I got going on
Even with me having a relationship with God
Cause I already knew what I was signed up for
Just everything played out like it's destined for me, look

[Verse 2]
I came from hiding from the cops, running with my mans
And getting blew at by the opps, ducking under vans
To copping shit before it drop and counting hunnid' bands
Tryna stay humble in the jungle, you don't understand
Cause when you come from nothing and turn that into something
Niggas get to hating, ones you never seen was coming
But you ain't pussy, fuck them niggas, make you start stunting
Get niggas pissed so they do something, make you start 'bussin
And this the struggle of a young black nigga tryna' make it
You livin' life, you gotta watch for niggas tryna take it
And can't surround yourself with niggas tryna' down niggas
Clown niggas, don't want work, just wanna be around niggas
I had to show my niggas money is the way out
Ain't gotta leave the gang but if you broke, that's how you stay out
And just moved Shanse' out in a new crib, all the way out
In a place I know my sis safe out cause my family know I don't play bout
