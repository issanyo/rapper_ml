[Verse 1: YP]
Back down and my pack loud, know how I do it
Check my influence, only rats I know in sewers
Been a hustler forever get upon my feet, get into it
And I never walk, if money talk I'm so fluent
My bank account got plenty digits, I'm in the sixes
And a couple hitters that don't give fuck 'bout no witness
If my album ever flop, I hit the block and get to flippin'
But who I'm kidding' now tip that bitch a million
Long as niggas wanna buy it, I'm just go continue dealin'
Marble in the floor, chandeliers up on the ceilin'
Cute bitch but my money look better
Whether it's this rap shit or this trap shit, I'm all about my cheddar
Big fin is like switch dig, got a dog house in my back yard
Stash in like Frank Lucas and plus I got this fat wad
Plenty cake, we eat just like a fat broad
Plenty wait and I'm tryna to get this black card
And presence I hate them, model bitches, I date them
Never catch me slipping we got plenty Clippers like Blake and them
Ball plan, I made you leave, all the leaves I'm raking in
So many losers, I'm just start to think that you hate to win
Fendi belt I don't need help, diamonds black as my car tint
Fuck her with this bank you see my arms waving like Carlton
OG mixed with Irene is the car sin
Don't fuck with jakes but I got pigs in my apartment

[Interlude: Lil herb]
Lets get it Lil Herb, 150
Going in man
YP, what up, broski

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Bitch I'm too cool, super cold
Your neck and wrist piece super old
Bitches texting me, tryna' sex the D
So I bring 'em out like the super bowl
And I'm racked up, I be spazzing out
Hit the Louie Store when I'm cashing out
Got a lot of dogs and they trained to go
Caught some wrist and cane and I pass 'em out
Yeah I do my thing on the money tip
So these bitches wanna be my honey dip
And these bitches always on some other shit
So I be focused on my brother ship
This NLMB, got some wild hoes
They NLMG let the cals blow
It's just me and YP puffin loud smoke
In the S.R.T lettin' mows flow
We gone, do the dash on the bitch
In the club wild out, throw some cash on the bitch
If a nigga wild out, get the last of the clip
Bubble put the hammer in the stash, in the whip
And I gotta smoke dos from my last on the shit
If I ever go broke I'ma spazz on the bitch
Mask up go poke, go ransom as shit
Ho's see my videos say I'm handsome as shit
Tryna' to wife a pretty ho, I done ran through the bitch
Me and my squad
In that new Benz like a free handed park
I got old bands, money just standing tall
Count so much cash I need three hands to ball
Count so much cash I need three hands to ball
Make a nigga bitch fuck me and my dogs
Kick her ass out I know she plan on calling, she plan on calling
