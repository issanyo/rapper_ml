[Chorus]
I used to sip that lean
I ain't wanna sleep no more, so I chased it with a bean
Came from havin' highspeed chases with my team
Started with this rap shit, now I'm doin' my thing
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Security ain't gon pat you at all, just walk in with me
And security ain't gon protect you at all, don't walk into me

[Verse]
What set you from, nigga? Who you talkin' to, me?
[?] with the concrete, have em white chalkin' your teeth
Go and turn up if you gon turn up, then we gon play your speed
You know we'll shoot this bitch up, like some MVPs
They don't even know where to run cause they hearin' them MPGs
When I used to sip lean it was fun, what the fuck is some MGP?
Big foenem was gettin' the fours from Black, it was tec and act
Lemme take it back, to that seal was already cracked, had to take it back
You niggas ain't really ain't sick cause I'm pullin' the stack
You niggas ain't tippin' the strippers, and oh, and your niggas ain't payin' it back
You niggas out here payin' tax
See me, I just be playin' with racks
My fans love me, I stay rappin' facts
They play in the streets in the 'Raq, where they at?
And I got that in the back on my lap
He ain't gang-gang, he ain't know Cap, slime
Throwin' up B's like Bloods and L's
L's or shells, two Glocks that's my tide
You grew up a pussy cause your habitat
And you met somebody that got you a strap
I guess you got tough after that
Yeah you ain't give no fuck after that
But really you wasn't even ready after that
Shit really started to go up after that
They still gon try you because you a fuck nigga
They make you up, and you gon have to bust after that
That's if you even brave enough, it's bad now
Niggas on your ass now
It's on sight, gotta clash now
Playin' games with your life, ain't no pass now (huh)

[Chorus]
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Came from havin' highspeed chases with my team
Started with this rap shit, now I'm doin' my thing
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Security ain't gon pat you at all, just walk in with me
And security ain't gon protect you at all, don't walk into me
