[Verse]
Got on all black posted in the club like a bouncer
Baby girl, the way you bounce it makes me arouse up
Really you the coldest in the room and I’m a browser
But I can’t dance with you I got this tool in my trousers
10:15 just to come see me in V.I.P
Everybody that’s with me you know they don’t show I.D,
My lil cuz damn near did three, right back in the streets
Lil nigga only 19 right back on his feet
It don’t matter where I go I gotta take the heat, even if that mean i’m goin to hell they ain’t takin me
I got 24 hollows in that magazine just cause my face in a lotta stores on the magazine
Member I was pouring fo’s leaning like a Mufucka
Sippin on that drank like a Mufucka
In the studio sleepin in the Mufucka
Glizzy on me tweakin like a Mufucka
Wreckless than a Mufucka, now a nigga blessed than a Mufucka, top flo eatin breakfast like a Mufucka, stressin bout a Mufucka, my momma’s restless than a Mufucka, went broke learned my lesson like a mufucka
Now i’m out here checkin bags, Mufucka
Any car ever had that bitch hella fast
Know I gotta do the dash, I burn hella gas
Glizzy up, do not talk, all you see is masks
And I just told the gorillas chill, but I might let em spaz
40’s and them 45’s get right on yo ass
And all we know is green light, when we on yo ass
Decide if you might get a pass, when we see a badge
Still lil bro don’t fuck with badgers, don’t fuck with badgers, honestly the blue and white really ain’t my swagger
Post yo ho but I ain’t tag her I’m tryna bag her
Hit her, Quit her, not a bragger, but she a nagger
If that hoe disloyal I despise her
I come from the mud, had to rise up, shed tears I done shed blood I advise it
Stack that paper, why you gotta run put your guys up
I got street smarts but I’m wiser
All these nigga’s suns where my visor
I don’t fuck with niggas like a master
If he disrespect me it’s a casper(Ghost!)
