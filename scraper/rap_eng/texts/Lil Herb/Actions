[Verse 1: Young Sizzle]
Gotta go get it, we livin' it honestly
Niggas don't fuck with us 'cause we too dominant
Whatever we planning, my nigga we running it
Keepin' it solid, we on that one hundred shit
Niggas be frontin', they know that they under me
Niggas be frontin', they know that they number three
Mob in this bitch and I'm eating like double me
Wrist is on bling and it cost me a hundred piece
Them  niggas be hating, they mad that I did it
Not with that lil poppin', they know that we with it
Don't fuck with them bitches, I'm 'bout my lil business
I swear that this money give me a great feeling
Gon' stack up that money 'til it break the ceiling
December alone I went and made a million
Tell 'em I will not quit it 'til a billion
Them niggas too small, we like to call 'em minions
I ride through Bentley coupe and fuck her top
I ride through the west strapped, me and Top
Them niggas be plottin', want me to drop
Went and bought my second BM, a drop
My necklace one thirty, this shit cost a crop
In love with that dirty, don't think I can stop
I took your lil trap and I let her go shop
I swear that it's murder to all of my opps

[Chorus: Young Sizzle]
Ride through the city, I'm strapped
Check on me nigga, racking that water
I'm good on that, go double the order
Don't fuck up my aura
I keep it one thousand with my niggas, I eat, you eat
Ain't no in-betweens
And I'll never ever turn for a bitch
Won't trade for the creed
Yeah, yeah, my actions gon' show that I'm real
Yeah, yeah, my actions gon' show with these mils
Yeah, yeah, my actions will let niggas spill
Hold up, yeah, my actions done caught me a deal

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
How much you gon' go broke before you say it's time to grind
Nigga I told you this time and time again
S'posed to be stacking, you lying again
Bro gotta save for this MAC, what you spend
Whatever gon' work, hit the block, I was 'bout dividends
Herb what you want for a verse, it depends
First gotta tell me what stage you in
Then send a ten, I'ma take you in
Lot niggas tried me, no limit
Ain't think this shit simple, I just love the rage you in
Once niggas really was in it, let's go on adventures
And a nigga will phase you in
Perc don't work, I'ma take two then
Fuck two bitches, take a break, you in
Fuck one then get head from another
Go'n head turn around, let me break you in
Really a nigga ain't have shit
If I tell you rags to riches, that shit true then
'Member I ain't even bat shit
I just really cashed the racks to let you spend
Whatever it takes to see my niggas win
Hopefully it motivate you then
Started off with a dollar, thought on my brother
A buck wasn't enough so I had turned face blue then

[Chorus: Young Sizzle]
Ride through the city, I'm strapped
Check on me nigga, racking that water
I'm good on that, go double the order
Don't fuck up my aura
I keep it one thousand with my niggas, I eat, you eat
Ain't no in-betweens
And I'll never ever turn for a bitch
Won't trade for the creed
Yeah, yeah, my actions gon' show that I'm real
Yeah, yeah, my actions gon' show with these mils
Yeah, yeah, my actions will let niggas spill
Hold up, yeah, my actions done caught me a deal
