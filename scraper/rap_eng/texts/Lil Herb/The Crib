[Intro]
Where you from? Where you from?
Goin' up, goin' up (Where you from?  Claim your set!)
Goin' up, goin' up (Where you from?  Claim your set!)
Where you from? Where you from?
Where you from? Where you from?
Goin' up, goin' up (Where you from?  Claim your set!)
Goin' up, goin' up

[Chorus: Jeremih & G Herbo]
I met a lil bitch in the 100's
Shorty always wild, she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side
I met a lil bitch on the islands
She show me it was why she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
I met a lil bitch on King Drive
Said she like everything king sized
Met a lil bitch on Western
Had to take her straight to the Western
Met a little bitch on Ashland
Got a lotta ass, she be crashin'
Swear I met a little bitch on the north side
Shawty had her ass on the horse side
Met a little bitch on Stony Island
Said she never been to an island
Met a little bitch on Vincennes
Pulled up on her ass in a big Benz
Met a little bitch on Halsted
Said she only like to fuck with bosses
Met a little bitch on south shore
Let her go south and wear short shorts
Met a bitch gettin' off the blue line
Told her she should let me hit it two times
Met a little bitch in Hyde Park
Love to get high when the car parked
Try the backwood baby, I spark
Wanna go rounds, baby?  I'll spar
Can we put on BET After Dark?
I'ma beat it, beat it at the afterparty

[Chorus: Jeremih & G Herbo]
I met a lil bitch in the 100's
She show me it was why she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side
I met a lil bitch on the islands
She show me it was why she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
What up with it baby, what it be like?
Call me Herbo, I be on the east side
Think it's "fuck you", must be from the south side
Seen't you dance in the parade back in '09
You be hangin' out with Quita from the west side
Off of Kedzie she stay right in the high rise
Got a baby by a nigga, he's from my side
Used to work on 47th at the Popeye's
Big sis went to Tilden at Mo-Town
Used to sneak me in that house and let it go down
Bitch named Tatiana and Lashay
From 71st and May
Shoppin' Louie and Chanel errday
Yeah my bitch from the 'burbs, she be buggin'
Always say she love me but she can never trust me
Bitch named India and that bitch an Indian
And she live on Indiana, ain't that a coincidence
And I got a grown bitch met her right on Talman
And I know she all in errtime I call her
Got a bitch on Michigan and she always in the shit
Say I'm always travelin', man that bitch a hypocrite
And I brought my rich white bitch right on Essex
Told her drop the top, baby I got you protected
She know if I'm anywhere I got my Smith & Wesson
I'm in my city everywhere from Lakeshore to Western

[Chorus: Jeremih & G Herbo]
I met a lil bitch in the 100's
She show me it was why she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side
I met a lil bitch on the islands
She show me it was why she be on it
I met a lil bitch on the low end
Shawty always love to go in
I met a lil bitch on the south side
Said it ain't too safe to go outside
I met a lil bitch on the west side
So I had to hit it on the west side
