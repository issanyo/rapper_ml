[Intro]
Nigga lookin' for us we out there in that gangway man
78th man
Come get it
Roc-block

[Hook]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
Trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway

[Bridge]
Them niggas from that gangway'll put in work
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
If you try to hit us up, we gone come and hit you first
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt

[Verse 1]
I from the side where they found Derrick Rose
He made a name off jump shots, we was out there shootin' poles
Hustle hard stackin' 0s, we was tryna get the dough
'til they started snatching 0s then we started snatching souls
We grew up right by the store, young as shit and we was runnin' shit
Started gettin' respected quick, earned it with a hundred clip
Ran into some beef then my youngins started dumpin' shit
Cut some niggas from the circle, they was on some other shit
My dogs was trained to go, they was blowing out they mother shit
We grew up on loyalty, EBK a brothership
Or should I say ya brotherhood, either way my brothers good
And if nigga wanna play pussy, I'mma blow em down like aï»¿ brother should
And you know I got the ratchet on me, if I'm ridin' round in another hood
Smokin' 3 5s out a blackjack, tell white Shawn roll another wood
And my niggas up to nothing good, every day is like the same day
And if a nigga out here looking for me you can find somewhere by the gangway

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You can catch me on that 8 block where we bang at (Rock-block)
If a nigga try to send shoots then his forehead what I aim at
And a nigga got that straight drop, all they wanna know is where the cane at?
Have my young niggas hit and kick doors, all they wanna know is where the stain at?
Run up in a nigga trap house with the macs out, where the keys at?
Pussy nigga wanna act up, he get clapped up cuz' I need that!
Take everything we can get up out it and forget about it, where the weed at?
And a lot of niggas out here hatin' on me, if you heard something don't believe that, straight-up
Niggas out here need to get there cake up
Gettin' to the money when I wake up
I get all the cash I can take up
And if I'm missing money then I make up
But if I don't eat it's a drought in the street
So early in the morning I'm out with this heat
And I'm all about the check, 'til a nigga disrespect
Like a day with LeBron, bitch I'm out with the Heat
A lot of these dudes don't be out in the street
I ain't in the house, bitch I'm out you can see
Let a bitch nigga act 'bout it to me
Have my young goon punch 'em in the mouth 'til he sleep
Ridin' round town with the strap in the seat
Run into a opp put the Glock to his cheek
Thought he'll make from the bottom to the top
Pop a shot from the Glock knock his top on his sneaks

[Hook]
