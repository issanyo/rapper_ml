When I pull up, you know I show out
My pockets pokin, yeah I brought my dough out
And these bitches know it, they love the way I show out
My team that's who they know bout, you see us it's a smoke out
Yo hoe she know im cashin
Gucci, louie fashion, plus my diamonds dancin
I fuck her without askin
My team shoot like the Mavericks, them choppa shots so rapid
My squad full of assassins, so now the opps been lackin
Them people tryna question can't answer what you askin
Catch me rollin aston, hammer tucked in traffic
Thumbin thru that cabbage, sippin on that actis
Call me wings and faces bitch, my robins full of jacksons
