[Hook x2: Capo]
Run in the crib, Macs out, put your face down
I'm forced to shootin', click clack, shootin' them Rugers
Stretch out like rulers, try me I'm forced to shootin'
They savage life and they ruthless, click clack shootin' them Rugers

[Verse 1: Capo]
Run in his crib, Macs out, put his face down
I'm forced to shootin', young niggas we forced to shootin' get ugly if you step to 'em
I hang with lions and apes, nigga who you is? Lil' niggas ruthless
I'm ridin' with niggas and guns when I up 'em to one
Hope my gun get to blowin', use your feet better run
(?), it don't matter shoot first
I'm 'bout these Jacksons and Franklins
Yo' bitch she mad 'cuz I made it
No money problems just pay it
Glo life yo' boyfriend he hate it
I'm 'bout these Jacksons and Franklins
Yo' bitch she mad 'cuz I made it
No money problems just pay it
Glo life yo' boyfriend he hate it
Watch the game and see how I play it
Don't want no smoke I don't play it

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
We some soldiers
Bitch we po'd up
And we go nuts
They can't hold us
Hammers cocked, bodies drop when we roll up
Put some hot in his top when we roll up
My niggas savage, they'll let you have it
Off the mollies in the party Capo got the ratchet, he blastin'
We got 30's, we got pumps, we got 50 shots
You sneak diss, you get slumped, pull on any block
I hang with shooters
Tote Ninas, Rugers, German Lugers
Man that's all they used to, run up on me and they forced to shoot ya'
Up early like a rooster, on the block totin' Glock's sellin' rocks like a rooster
Run up on me ima' do ya', 'cuz I'm in it fingers itchin' blowin' triggers what I'm used to
