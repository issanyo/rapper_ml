[Intro]
Yeah, G Herbo
That be Maaly Raw
Uh-huh, yeah

[Hook]
I was out there with that hard I had that glass
Way before Goyard I had that bag
I was up on Essex Block, I should've been at class
They like "Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass"

[Verse 1]
When Keef 'nem was out saying "Bang bang!"
We was on the 8 making Glocks do the same thang
Rollie got my shirt off, let my chain hang
First niggas yellin out "Gang gang!"
Go on a hit, I was with Crazy James
He like, "Don't panic", the main thang
And I don't think I'm God
But you can die if you say my name in vain
It's Lil' Herbo you know what it is with me
I don't even gotta say the G
I get booked for a show, I can buy you a key
I don't even gotta say the fee
What you ridin' foreign, you pull up in Vs
Push to start you don't got no keys
They like, "What's that, an S63?"
Got yo shit cocked back, what you wanna see, pussy?
You a killer, don't push it
"Aye Herbo, you from over east?"
Bitch what you one of the G's?
You don't see me throwing up B's
You don't see me droppin' the G's
You don't hear we poppin' at G's
You don't know what's NLMB
Only my Glock is a G, aye

[Hook]
I was out there with that hard, I had that glass
Way before Goyard, I had that bag
I was up on Essex Block, I should've been at class
They like "Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass"

[Verse 2]
Throwin' up L's, throwin up B's
Droppin' the five, droppin' the G's
Droppin' the Trey's, drop everything
We EBK, we say fuck everything
I gave my .40 a wedding ring
Call me MVP, I get ahead ya team
And we don't got no license for this weaponry
Every nigga with me got a felony
Every nigga with me gotta let it squeeze
Yeah, this a XD, got a lemon squeeze
I'm a real nigga, no lim, not a GD, not a BD, not a MC
Not a 4C, not a VL, diamonds VV
I'm just G Herbo rocking Gucci, skeet the GT
Got that G-Loc on me, hollows in there, just on GP aye

[Hook]
I was out there with that hard, I had that glass
Way before Goyard, I had that bag
I was up on Essex Block, I should've been at class
They like "Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass
Yo lil' gangbangin' ass, yo lil', gangbangin' ass
Herbo, yo lil' gangbangin' ass"
