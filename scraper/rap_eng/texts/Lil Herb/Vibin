Pour a cup, sit back, roll up, we vibin
Is we vibin? Is we vibin? (Is we vibin?)
Wanna see, wanna touch, wanna get inside it. (Wanna see, wanna touch, wanna get inside it)
Pussy good but I like when we vibin.  (Pussy good but I like when we)
And she show love to me cause she know I been through a lot
Don’t question me cause she know just what I’m gone do or not. Lifestyle ain’t nothing to me, yeah she know I run through the guap
And she put her trust in me cause I know what to do wit her (her body, when she wit me we vibin)

[Verse 1}
She fuck wit me cause she say she know I been through a lot
And iont talk too much I ain’t gotta say what I'm gone do a lot
She say she love me but I don’t know if that’s true or not
Never had no woman in my life I was tryna shoot a Glock
But I fuck witchu cause we be vibin, so I keep you by me
Ain’t gotta warn me when you nearby, just say you slidin
Used to ignore me, used to play games till I got behind it
Let me kiss your lips while I kill it on top, then I let you ride it
Let me hold your waist till you feel it up top, when I let you hide it. But fuck that shit I need a real bitch, baby is you signed in?
Gotta tote that 9 if I go do time, Bitch, tell me is you ridin?
No disrespect but when I say my bitch that’s what I take pride in

[Verse 2}
Look, I done seen a lot of shit, I fucked wit a lot of hoes
Yeah I mean a lot hoes, foreign, bad, exotic hoes
But I'm just honest tho, can’t compare you to none of those
And aside of fucking, girl you know you my homie tho
Cause ain’t nothing like when we vibin
I’m smoking gas and, everytime I’m stressed you keep me smiling, I keep you laughing
Your body like my Smith & Wesson I’m always caressing
Sometimes I can’t stay in the house cause I’m always finessin
I swear to god i'on give these hoes my time, these bitches irritating
I'ont make visits, we can’t kick it, only penetration
If she ain’t suckin on no dick I don’t want conversation
Witchu it’s different, rub my back when I need ventilation
And when we vibe it feel like quality time
Except for when you start bitchin bout all of these bitches potentially tryna be mine
And you know I ain’t trippin bout none of these niggas cause shawty you know I know how it go
Don’t you worry bout me, keep it real witcho self and just get up wit me down the road
And you know it ain’t nothin when I’m doing shows, you can get up wit me on the road
And lil shawty yo nigga do not gotta know you can get up wit me on the low
And a lot of these bitches be on my bumper that’s why I be changing my number
I just moved to LA for the rest of the winter I might not come back till the summer
Gotta stay on my grind, money all on my mind
You know I’m a savage for mine
And you know I be loving when you got on nothing, and then you start letting your hair down
When you miss me you know it ain’t nothing to hit me and get on the American Airlines
I’m only a call away, if you busy then just hit me up in yo spare time
Get up wit me to vibe and share time
(Aye)
