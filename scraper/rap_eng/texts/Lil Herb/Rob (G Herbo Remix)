My lil nigga keep a bankroll never had a job
He must tote him a lil pistol and know how to rob

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
Personally see me I ain’t never had to rob
And I was hustlin' so I ain't never had a job
But I got niggas that spend Christmas' behind bars
And other ones that fuck yo Christmas up so they don't starve

And don’t try to get it back
Shit like that gon get you wacked
I tell my lil niggas don't be robbin’ quit robbin'
They like we want everything we eat but we goblins
If its in my face that mean we need it bro I'm sorry
I just want me a garage to put a new rari
I know moms was hungry
Sittin' in the dark all lonely
I was once you I know what you wanna do
Please don’t try me don't wanna put one in you if you

Chase the bag never chase a thot
Secure the bag don't secure the thot
Ain't talkin' shit we schemin' to rob
Talkin' get fucked up off gaurd you get robbed
You talkin' bout robbin' me nigga just stop
You tellin' on niggas you pussy you opp
You snake to the feds you pussy tells cops
Say no names pussy or else you'll get popped
My niggas be lurkin' pull up foreign whips
Pitch black at night issa Late Late trip
Broad day dirty looks rob you on our sight
Jammin' yo loud now we high like a kite
You stopped goin' to church so don't say its not right
Styll on Fazoland don't get caught at the light
I remember the dem nights fo food jam da stores
School givin' apples eat that and the core
Them seeds made me choke like the loud that I smoke
Like root growin' deep in veins for these hopes
And you said you needed that
Fuck, you had to rob that
You told me that you needed me
Bitch you fuckin' lyed to me
You stole my heart and u broke it to bleed
Now I'm killin' niggas like Assassins Creed
Robbin' these niggas for me's a good deed
Robbin' you nigga like set my soul free nigga
Gang!
