[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah
This beat got that Uzi and Herb
Might pull up to the [?]
Yeah
[?]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Walk inside that lawyer office with 100 sticks (yah)
Told him that I want all of my fucking royalties (right now)
Might as well call me tall 'cause you not shortin' shit
Pablo Escobar, so for real
Five diamonds in that tag on the lear
So my diamonds light brown like beer
Niggas say they can't stand me, get a chair
[?]

[Verse 1: G Herbo]
(Ayy)
In the yo with Slime and Vert, we throwing B's (B's aye)
Last night left out AOD, we was throwing G's
Soon as I did the walk through, bought some extra P's
Then I cleared the new check, iced my neck with V's
Fuck two bitches myself, one I think Japanese
Can't pop off 'bout myself 'cause you clap the G's
Pieces out the Goyard store, bought racks for me
I can't pop out no where under 10 racks for free
My lil' killers ready to go get whacked for free
You lil' snitching bitch, don't say no nigga got whacked for me, ayy, ayy
Riding in V's, ayy, ayy
You ain't getting no money, yeah that's catastrophe, ayy, ayy
I ain't never need no nigga picking up tabs for me
I ain't never letting you fuck niggas get in the lab with me
You can't add this shit up, can't do math with me
Everything Swervo do, I made niggas mad at me
Mix Amiri shit with them Raf's
So I buy my bitch new bags
So I buy new whips and new pads
So I

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Walk inside that lawyer office with 100 sticks (yah)
Told him that I want all of my fucking royalties (right now)
Might as well call me tall 'cause you not shorting shit
Pablo Escobar, so for real
Five diamonds in that tag on the leer
So my diamonds light brown like beer
Niggas say they can't stand me, get a chair

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
[?]
[?]
Gotta fuck me till I cum, cum, cum, cum
Feel it in my chromosome, some, some, some
Draco with a dome
Money on my mom
Money in my bones
Money 'till I'm gone
Drive the Brink's truck to the referrals
Pull up to the club with a unicorn
If that bitch ain't got class, call truancy
Fuck you doin? Ball like Patrick Ewing, bitch
Pull up to the club start stunting
Hop inside that player club and let it rip
Blow that motherfucker up to smithereens
All five pockets got the jelly beans
I just had a molly I was off a bean
I got 50 million quarter million lens
I just came to the trap and bought the bitch
Came to the studio and blow the P
I was chasing a check, got [?] me
I want some hip [?] on lean
I caught up with him, sprayed his ass like Oil Sheen
Pussy, money, weed and some codeine

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Walk inside that lawyer office with 100 sticks (yah)

Might as well call me tall 'cause you not shorting shit

Five diamonds in that tag on the leer
So my diamonds light brown like beer
