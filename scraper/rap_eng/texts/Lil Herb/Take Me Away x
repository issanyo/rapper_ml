[Hook]
Lord take me away
From all the people that ain't tryna help make me a way
I told my mama no more stugglin' its gon' be OK
Yea I was hustlin' in them streets tryna make me a way

Mama told me bet not let them streets take me away
So I got to that shit, stuck to that shit now she OK
She call my phone to ask how long am I gone be away
Cause where I'm at now, fall asleep same time as she awake

[Verse 1]
Lord take me away
To another place
I'm from a place where it ain't safe to put my gun away
This street shit ain't the same no more they took the fun away
I use to post up on that block and had my gun on waist
Knee deep in them streets wasn't nothing to say I ain't play no fucking games
I was with my niggas you know they with it
Ain't hang with no fucking lames
Don't drop our names
Still Dropout Gang we'll pull up bustin' brains
I remember them days in the studio late sweating like a fucking slave
Too many days now, it take a day just to make a hunnit K
Hunnit thousand days I was up at night tryna make another way
Got my mama another place that other shit don't mean nothing to me

Lord take me away
From all the people that ain't tryna help make me a way
I told my mama no more stugglin' its gon' be OK
Yea I was hustlin' in them streets tryna make me a way

Mama told me better not let them streets take me away
So I got to that shit stuck to that shit now she OK
She call my phone to ask how long am I gon' be away
Cause where Im at now, fall asleep same time as she awake

[Verse 2]
Young nigga fucked that sack up tryna make me a way
Stuck to my grind got that shit back it ain't take me away
Broke inna hood before I ever made it on the big screen
Selling 14 15's
Then I started spitting 16's
All I ever knew was get cream
Only other way was hit fiends
Made my mama cry to get this shit nigga im from the street
I seen my homies die up in this shit nigga wasn't nothing sweet
Remember nights I cried I think of that and that's wat humble me
I know that my life always at risk I keep that bitch with me
Fuck the penitentiary
Niggas won't get shit from me
Murder Murder kill thy enemy don't show no sympathy
If I don't sqeeze that trigger where im from they end up killing me
Nigga
