[Intro]
NLMB 150 Roc block shit man
Ball like im kobe the mixtape
Hold up
Running through a check...
Herbo, herbo this and that...

[Hook]
I rap, I trap, and stack, so I always get it back
Fiends and rappers hit my flip phone like "Herbo where you at?"
Herbo thumbin through that check
Herbo, herbo this and that
You would think i'm playing track the way im runnin to that sack
Runnin, runnin to that sack
The way im runnin to that sack
Runnin, runnin to that sack
Runnin, runnin to that sack
Runnin, runnin to that sack
The way im runnin to that sack
You would think i'm playing track the way im runnin to that sack

[Verse 1]
Gherbo im that nigga
I hit up sacks and I spend that sack
I love Glizzys, I love Macs
Just bought a 50 shot for Max
All these racks that I got
And my shooters around me
They shooting about me, I'm safe and they strapped
Up in the club hit a nigga with a 5th of Moet
Watch your step nigga, where yo head at, straight to the back
I don't politic in the club, straight to the back
All these hoes in my face but im straight to the back
Got them poles in the place, all of my niggas got a pole on they waist
Put holes in ya face
Now we gone
Clear the scene
Smoking loud
Sipping lean
That's the remedy
Pour pineapple crush, bitch I don't do Hennessy
I came from the bottom
These bitches ain't want me
But now that i'm up
They remember me
She knocking me down
And right after I nut, we don't fuck
Cuz she sucked all my energy
And my nigga I know why you hating on me
Cuz im only 18 but I've been a G
Why he hating on me?
Need to get on his feet
Hit the streets and go try and make him some G's
If we find out you holding that white and
That night have my niggas climb in yo chimney
We got 50 shot scopes and Glocks with the lights
Stand over a nigga, no sympathy
Lil bro go BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM till the glizzy go empathy
I mean empty, Excuse me, but the Codeine is killing me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hundred thou, 100s
Fifty thou, 50's
Twenty thou, 20's
We don't count the 1's
Buy a lot of guns
30 shot FN'S
Rugers with the beams
Glizzys with the drums
Bitches on me daily
Wanna have my baby
Ho you must be crazy
I am not the one
Louie to the wallet
Nothing in this pocket
Racks in my jacket
I look like a bum
I got lil niggas doing hits for fun
Niggas hating on me cuz I fuck their bitches
I just do it just because
And I love to stunt
All these 100's on me
I just do this shit for cuz
RIP my niggas and free all my niggas
I get high, it's like im talking to my niggas
Bussin off them hittas
Leanin, rollin swishas
Remember them days posted up on the 8 with my niggas
And I didn't have anything
Now we all out of state
Smoking dope, sipping 8's
And we walk in the mall and buy anything
When I go in the house
And my mama be asking me "boy why the fuck you keep spending racks?"
Cuz im young and I never had all of this money before Ma
And I know im gon get it back!
Love money so much put a hollow inside of my head
The day that my bread gone
Smoking this Pasto it's making my head gone
Pasto got my head gone
Don't run through the 8 block, that's a red zone
