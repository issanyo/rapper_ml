I was starved then, I ate the beat
I said my grace  Bon appétit
I’m MJ in my 23 stay high asf no Mercury
I will never give them mercy
All y’all rhymes is nursery
Fuck a mother goose ima father nigga
Better duck twice when that cannons loose
Have little homies and ya big homies
All looking like  Campbell Soup
What’s a  Ford Focus to a Bentley Coupe
No  comparison like me and you
He want the beef I turn his ass to food
Stripping shit not sending nudes
Turn the fire up put the water in
Then chop him up now he beef stew
Wait I got the fire that will wet up
The choppa cook him up like beef stew
Pop a  Air he then air it out like I got a balloon
Think you Butterfly the Beretta in better fly in your cocoon
I got the drum and the stick with it like I was with Maroon Five
I want to have a Jag in a Jaguar like them niggas in Dubai
Dumb nigga I’m to fly they watching me like top live
Heard theses niggas was FBG Ducking when it was time to slide
They sucking me like a  Passafire have him hanging by a cable wire
You ain’t real u fucking liar, you ain’t a killer u gun survivor
You ain’t  toteing nothing you got a tote bag
She sniffing me I got dope swag
For you niggas it’s a close casket flower bring and slow singing
Dripping heavy like nose bleeding
Y’all niggas hot for one season
Thank you Ma’am I do slaughter niggas, but no sure I don’t fuck with them
I’ll put that tray in they face, like I’m trying lunch with them
Got fat pockets “Ouu Killem” let dogs out anf they just sick em
You I’ll but I’m way iller, you bought to be ya own grave digger
Playa Playa, Playa hater playa bitch and fuck a hater
On top like a numerator calculating up all the paper
Calico  gonna hit ya bagel sit them down like a couch potato
Potato on the tray I dump it out like it was trifflin
Triumphant with the gun Brrrumpum with the stick
I stay low like saggy tits but these tics tipping my dick
They watching out for  me the rolling ticking on the wrist
Taking moves that I risk, I’m taking shots like a flick
I’m take lives with this nine with  tatted arms out the whip
Hit Nae Nae and Quan when I’m jumping out the whip
Putting in the box Ima need the height and width
I don’t do no talking shit you high as shit
Thinking you gonna bag my lines coke ain’t free get back in line
Drop a nigga like  teary-eye you bugging thinking you get fly
You probably jumped names on all ya niggas who really did the crime
Don’t know nothing don’t say nothing
Split ya onion get the clip dumping
Unrevealing all the real shit which left his ass cold blooded
Hell yeah I’m cold blooded
Frozen pipes all in my veins
Foreign weed got me feeling strange
Smoking camal shit kick start the playing
Starved with no stomach
Got the Mac and you know I love it
Shots from that can ya guys gonna get more of it
Get shot in on the can
The shit spread with no fan
Protected when I bus it’s stretch no Trojan
It’s fuck all the romance
Want money and a pole dance
I’ll haven meet god quicker like praying with both hands
Get point like Uncle Sam, I’m undefeated you toe jam
That action you ain’t really about it
They acting for the audience
