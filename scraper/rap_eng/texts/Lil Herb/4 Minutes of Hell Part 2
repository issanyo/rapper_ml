R.I.P. them niggas
Welcome to Fazoland coming soon
Just be patient
I know that's what ya'll been waiting for

Let's Get It!
Free them niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Herb]
Look I wake up every morning with the same state of mind
Bitch I'm running to this money
Let the lames wait in line
I'm impatient
Bitch I'm chasing
This first place and we not racing
Now I'm cashing
Riding Astons
Went from sitting in the station
But I'm up now

All the neighborhood hoes wanna fuck now
I can't let chain me up like a chump now
I just call my lil bros let her bustdown
See Jackie at the top when you touch down
I done lost alotta niggas to this street shit
Had to duck alotta triggers to this street shit
I done seen alotta niggas do this street shit
But the streets talk when you in deep shit

Taught me get rich cause you can't beat this
Gotta stay afloat niggas getting seasick
Gotta get the dough I ain't with the cheap shit
For everybody ever said I wouldn't be shit
Seen my homie hit twice coulda been three
Almost seen Christ twice coulda been three
I'mma burn these pipes 'fore they get me
I had to earn my stripes coulda went sweet

Now I separate from niggas I don't trust
Niggas that ain't starve with me
And all them bitches I ain't fuck
Cause I was working hard
Mixmatching words straight in that booth attaching verbs
Herb gon' get what he deserve and I deserve it all

Got some shit a couple labels heard
Now they want Herb to ball
Get me out the hood and in them hills
Man I done heard it all
But honestly my niggas honour me
Won't leave that hood at all
And honestly, No Limit sponsors me
Me and my hood gon' ball

Responsibly I keep my promises
No need for compliments
I do as I please like the G's
Fuck the consequence
You boys ain't in my league
Got my speed or accomplishments
Might catch me overseas smoking weed eating Lobster tail

Or I'm probably over East where they pop you over beef
Dissing 'bout them L's boys until they spot you in the street
Now they got you in the streets
With nun' to block you from that heat
Ain't no boxing over East
My youngins pop before they speak

That's the way it go in my city
They trained to go in my city
We dream of sunny days
But it rain and snow in my city
Them things will blow in my city
Them boys be feeling anger
Can't just be hood on hood
Them boys be killing strangers

Everything ain't good all good
It ain't the same when your mans draw blood
Niggas change when the gang draw blood
When it's cold in the game
Niggas don't know your name
Have you posted on the block
Giving blows in the rain
16 toting Glocks thinking those are the things
Now you on top riding fours on a range
Everywhere niggas claim yall cuz

Nah it ain't all love where I meet you at
Niggas want Herb man that's why I keep a strap
Posted over East man where them heaters at
Run up on me bro let them heaters clap
And dear Lord I pray
That on the day when you take me away
I got enough money laid in the safe
To make sure my moms and my sister they straight

But the Lord coulda took me today
Let a nigga run up on me cook me today
It wouldn't be easy I stay with the Eight
Or I make one call have them K's in his face
Catch me in the mall spending K's on my waist
All I know is ball
And I do it harder than ya'll
In the club throwing racks got your broad off the wall
Off the Po' up leaning so hard I could fall

Codeine
Pour me up
Triple cups
Fours a night
Smoking dope
Sipping lean
Purple sprite
Hold the ice

Me and broski riding in that challenger high as fuck
Any nigga challenge us
Duck when we riding up

Buck at the nigga back
Buss till the nigga flat
One to his fitted cap
Watch how the nigga act

Skeet off
Drop the heat off
Call an ass to hit
Pick her up smash the bitch
V12 fast as shit

Dudeski call it Activist
I'm gon' off a six
I ain't lackin' while it's crackin'
Something long on my hip
Big pole nigga
You gotta be strong just to live
Quick soul lifter
This will get him gone in a jiff

Leave a nigga right there on the block where I'm at
Riding through kids and Marley in a lot with the Mac
Riding through trigger we gone leave you stinging from the black
Nigga lay a couple bricks on a mat
We on that
Apologies you don't want that
Run upon us with the chance you ain't blow that
Too bad man I feel for you
Say you eating man I hope your squad got a last meal for you

Catch a nigga in the store we blow him
Catch a nigga with his ho we blow him
Catch a nigga he don't got it we smoke him
Catch a nigga out in traffic we on him

Niggas think they want static do they really?
Ask me why I start rapping do they hear me?
But this shit ain't only rap cause it's in me
We ain't worried 'bout your stack we got 50's

Put No Limit on my back for the city
And No Limit's where it's at in the city
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me

L's
