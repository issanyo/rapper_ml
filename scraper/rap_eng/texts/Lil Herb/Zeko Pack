Zeko, is what i'm smokin' on (that Zeko Pack)
If I catch an opp lackin' i'll get 'em gone
Bitch i'm Rondo, leave me alone

[Verse 1: RondoNumbaNine]
Bitch i'm Rondo i'm ridin' lowkey
If I catch a opp, imma let this Mac speak
D. Rose clap him with that heat
D. Rose cut this nigga up
Man he's gone and he out of here
And I'm gone and I'm out of here
Sit the fuck down
Matter fact, you can move around
Bitch, this is not your town, it's finna be a man down
I don't make no sound, I don't even talk
And we don't make no sound

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bosstop]
Tooka, what i'm smokin' on (Shondale)
O Block bitch, They my ten year bros
Run up on yo block, 50, let it go
Man down bitch you already know
Back to the hood rollin' up that dope

They don't want no beef, bitch I keep that heat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Herb]

Fuck the cops, if they snatch us we don't know
Everyday I smoke OG and pour a 4
I'm leanin' hard, pass the glizzy to D. Rose
We in the field, pull on yo block and shoot free throws
These niggas bitches he ain't beat his case, he told
Get killed tonight for talkin' shit the day before
Rollin' off them flats with a whole 17 and I ain't even know
Lil Mally 30 shot Glocks man down on the opps, now we rollin' up dope

[Hook]

[Verse 4: D. Rose]
People came one day I ain't know
People came knockin' at the door (12 )
Hell yeah, yes sir, yes sir
Click clack I ain't go
Early morning in traffic with the bros
Tryna slide on folks

In the stu throwing Bs
Get fresh, do that and a flat
OB 600, you the gang then you set
A lotta guns a lotta drillers don't get wet
Niggas with me hard body they ain't scared
