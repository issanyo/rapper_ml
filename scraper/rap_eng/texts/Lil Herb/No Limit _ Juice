[Intro: Playboi Carti]
Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Honrable
Bih! Yeah! Ooh

[Verse 1: Playboi Carti]
Ooh, shit, yeah, bih
I put your ho in the Louvre
Yeah I blow smoke out the roof
Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
Feel like 2Pac, got the juice
First I go call up the troops
We run it up like we do
Bitch I go cop me a coupe
Bitch I go cop me a booth
Then I go swool with the loot
Put that lil bih on her back
Told that lil bih to relax
Tell that lil bih I got back
Told that bih I got stacks
Hollup lil bih, that's lil cash
Spend a lil check on the rent
Spend a lil' check on the brick
She got the cake in the back
I got the K in the back
I got my face in the sack
Hit your block hard like some crack
I told that lil' nigga we back
I told that bih we got back
I told that lil' nigga we back
Who that boy there with the bag?
Who that bitch there with the ass?
I sip the lean and the gas
I keep that shit in the back
For that lil' work, bitch I tax
For that lil' verse, bitch I tax
All of these hoes, they attached
Fuckin' your bitch, that's some facts
Half of these niggas, they rats
Half of these niggas, they rats
Hit your block hard with the Gat
Hit your block hard like some crack

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Ayy, bitch I came up sellin' crack
Wasn't no sleep, I was up with the night owls
Some my niggas was there but ain't no more
Capo said he’ll vouch for it right now
Switchin' shifts from the alley to corner
See them cops at the block and yell right out
We don't put in, we out here with two jobs
You ain't trappin', you best have that pipe out
40 Glock with the stick and the light out
Roll the window down, stick this bitch right out
Nigga talkin' like he sick in this cold world
It's our shit up in here, take 'em right out
Internet got the world tryna fight now
All these tweets get a fuck nigga hype now
Disrespect me, I'll go to you right now
With these rhymes that I got, put you right down
And I will beat you up 'cause I know how
Lay a fuck nigga out if I like how
Livin' nights on that block, I couldn't lie down
Interrogations and I'll put that lie down
Still keep them choppers where we go
Still keep that fuego from migo
And I cannot fuck with no googoos
We treat the Rudys like Renos
Still don’t catch me with no Bru Brus
Still rock Balmain with my new trues
G Herbo ain't no goody two shoes
Still'll do you 'cause I got some loose screws
Takin' trips outta town with my boo boo
Might skeet off right past you in the new coupe
She got weave in her hair and it's too loose
Got a Bs in the air, throw a soo-woo
Hit a lick like Ace Boogie with Lulu
Then I might buy her a poodle
And I might buy her a deuce deuce
Just in case she with me when I shoot you

[Outro: G Herbo]
Ayy, G Swervo
Yeah, deuce, deuce
Fuck up your life like some voodoo
Carti with me too
I got Carti with me too
You ain’t part of what we do
