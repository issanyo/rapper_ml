[Intro: Lil Reese]
Gangway shit man, Lil Herbie, what up?

[Chorus: Lil Herb]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way, but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
We trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway

[Bridge: Lil Herb]
Them niggas from that gangway'll put in work
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
If you try to hit us up, we gone come and hit you first
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case
And I be in that gangway, where my gang stay
Getting money and fucking bitches at the same time, that's how I play
And I be in that gangway, fuck nigga coolin' where it ain't safe
Out here in this gangway, my niggas wildin', boy, we don't play
That's how we rock in that gangway
I'm getting money while they gangbang
300 shit we not the same thang
I'm falling back while she give me brain
Get jammed up, just don't mention names
Keep my circle tight cause I don't fuck with lames
Got my circle tight now they say I change
I wouldn't change for a lil' change
And I be in that gangway, where them gangs stay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case

[Chorus: Lil Herb]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way, but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
We trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
In that gangway again with the Macs
Everybody strapped, red beam for his back
The opps ridin' past, let them opps ride past
50 shots from the Mac on the scene where they left
Gotta stain on some pounds and some keys where they at?
My team gotta eat, anything for the stacks
I gotta have money like fiends to the crack
I keep the iron on me, ion reach for the Gat
Wake up gotta hit the streets with the Gat
I can never lack, go to sleep with the Gat
If ion got it on me you should reach for the strap
Gotta lotta heat from the beef that we got
Niggas hatin' on the squad cause we beasts in the trap
Lil Herb takin' off, put the East on my back
We be really in the field, just riding through the block
If you ever wanna see where the street niggas at
Me and Lil Reese going wild in the city
Off the loud and the Remy, .45 in the semi
Kush smoke car ride blowin' loud in the Hemi
Catch a nigga outside, give him 5 to the kidney
Get ghost, in that gangway where I be at
Lotta drugs on me if you need that
Gotta lotta niggas wit a lotta triggas
We'll drop a nigga, where the weed at?

[Chorus: Lil Herb]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way, but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
We trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway
