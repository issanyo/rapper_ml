[Intro]
Ay, rolling my fucking stinky up man. I have a flight 7 in the morning, I'ma be right back in Chicago like 8, 9 o'clock at night though, you know in and out shit, uh

[Hook]
Ay, Lord take me away
From all the people that ain't tryna help make me a way
I told my mama no more struggling, it's gon' be okay
Yeah, I was hustling in them streets tryna make me a wave
Mama told me, better not let them streets take me away
So I got to that shit, stuck to that shit, now she okay
She called my phone to ask how long I'm gon' be away
Cause where I'm at, I fall asleep same time as she awake

[Verse 1]
Lord take me away
To another place
I'm from a place where it ain't safe to put my gun away
This street shit ain't fun no more, they took the fun away
I used to post up on that block and have my gun on waist
Knee deep in them streets with nothing to say, I ain't playing no fucking games
I was with my niggas, you know they with it, ain't hang with no fucking lames
Don't drop our names, still jump out gang, we'll pull up bust some brains
I remember them days in the studio late sweating like a fucking slave
Too many days now I take a day just to make 100k
100,000 days I was up at night tryna make another wave
Got my mama another place, that other shit don't mean nothing to me, ay

[Hook]
Ay, Lord take me away
From all the people that ain't tryna help make me a way
I told my mama no more struggling, it's gon' be okay
Yeah, I was hustling in them streets tryna make me a wave
Mama told me, better not let them streets take me away
So I got to that shit, stuck to that shit, now she okay
She called my phone to ask how long I'm gon' be away
Cause where I'm at, I fall asleep same time as she away

[Verse 2]
Young nigga fuck that sack up tryna make me a wave
Stuck to my grind got that shit back, it ain't take me away
Broke in the hood before I ever made it on the big screens
Selling 14s, 15s, then I started spitting 16s
All I ever knew was get cream
Only other way was hit fiends
Made my mama cry to get this shit, nigga I'm from the streets
I've seen my homies die up in this shit nigga, wasn't nothing sweet
Remember nights I cried, I think of that and that's what humbled me
I know that my life always at risk, I keep that bitch from me
Fuck the penitentiary, niggas won't get shit from me
Murder-murder, kill thy enemy, don't show no sympathy
If I don't squeeze that trigger from where I'm from they end up killing me, nigga

[Hook]
Ay, Lord take me away
From all the people that ain't tryna help make me a way
I told my mama no more struggling, it's gon' be okay
Yeah, I was hustling in them streets tryna make me a wave
Mama told me, better not let them streets take me away
So I got to that shit, stuck to that shit, now she okay
She called my phone to ask how long I'm gon' be away
Cause where I'm at, I fall asleep same time as she away
