[Intro]
Me and bro just left the store, we ain't leave the Versace store
Squad

[Verse]
This ice got me rocky like I'm 'lluminati without no Versace
I don't rock Versace, but don't get me wrong if I did I could cop it (I got it)
I stay in designer, my shirt by Givenchy all white like I'm Gotti
You know I get money, I run through them hundreds and no one can stop me
Bitch it's Lil Herbie, I think I'm the hottest I'm just bein' honest
I want it I cop it, that's why yo bitch on me man tell her to stop it
These niggas keep screaming Versace Versace Versace Versace
No wonder I'm cocky, Versace shit barely cost more than my Robins
You bros must be stupid this Louis this Gucci you know I been doin' this
I'm broke man that's Ludacris I stunt so much I can go and buy you some shit
Mixtape in the making and I got some old shit as well as my newest shit
Nobody fucking with Herb I'm the best if I rap bout stupid shit
But back to the basics catch me on the 8 with them racks in my truey fit
Got a mac and a ruger clip, naw this ain't rap man I really been through some shit
R.I.P C-mo and Peewee I just lost the guys to some stupid shit
The opps started scoring they must be getting lucky I swear all they do is miss
I been in the streets and I been totin' heat man I swear I ain't new to this
I'm trying to get all my niggas up outta here first class on some movie shit
Might grab me an Audi with all of these thousands, don't know what to do with it
Got so many killers with 30s act stupid ain't no tellin' who shootin' shit
No limit 150 the squad, new niggas no we not recruitin' 'em
No limit 150 go hard, without them I might not be doin' shit
My broskies they savage 50s in the ratchet right through you can have it
Might drop us a body the police start snatchin', I swear I forgot it
They ask me some questions bout opps I'm like fuck em them niggas some faggots
My niggas they savage, hit yo bitch from the back send her cause she average
Just know I ain't talkin' bout soul food, but you can get whacked for that cabbage
All this dough, gotta have it, bitch I had cash way before I was rappin'
Way before I was snappin' don't know what happen but bro 'nem was trappin'
In the field ain't no lackin' and maxi a savage be safe cause he packin'
Moody, Lil Mally n' Rammo in traffic with four automatics
Lil Mally he smaller than average but bet he can hold up that ratchet
He gon' drop ya just as fast as them Migos be sayin' Versace
Lil Mallys gon' pop 'em, Versace Versace Versace Versace
And then we not stoppin', puttin' bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies
My Mom say she pray everyday, that I'm safe and she always ask god that he watch me
But I still keep that rocket
Cause they plottin' and angels ain't always gon' watch me
And they wanna drop me, but still gotta get it can't worry bout shit but my wallet No I'm on a mission if you ain't 150 the please stay the fuck out my business
I'm all bout my digits came from the bottom of bottoms let god be my witness
Niggas hate how I'm spittin', only the realest can feel it just shut up and listen
Y'all money been missin'
Labels start talkin' them millis feel free to come get me
But today I'm still chillin, smoking dutches and phillys and fuckin' these bitches Bitch you suck dick who you kissin' yo' bitch next to me and she bout to come missin'
