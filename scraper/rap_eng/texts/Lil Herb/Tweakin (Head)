[Intro]
Swervo
Swervo
Ayy
Ayy

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get some head
Baby, I'm just tryna get some bread
Fuck the haters, I'ma chase a bag
I paid 4K for this Fendi bag
Let her taste the molly, got her tweakin'
She just met Young Sizzle, now she tweakin'
Bitch just seen my pistol, now she tweakin'
Mixing percs with liquor, I be tweakin'

[Verse 1]
I'm a brazy psycho, I be tweakin'
But I make 10,000 every weekend
Big six bedroom house my mama sleep in (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
Some nights I don't even stay there, she be tweakin'
Every state we go, we drop the G's in
Throw both my hands up just to chuck the B's with
I'm with Hell Rell, not from Killa Season
10 milli' kit, it got my glizzy breezing
Yo ho don't ever wanna listen, tweaking
Said I want hot sauce with my bizzy beezin'
You niggas can't bool with my, I'm busy bevin'
She by the pool with me, she pretty pleasin'
Told her I'm just tryna

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get some head
Baby, I'm just tryna get some bread
Fuck the haters, I'ma chase a bag
I paid 4K for this Fendi bag
Let her taste the molly, got her tweakin'
She just met Young Sizzle, now she tweakin'
Bitch just seen my pistol, now she tweakin'
Mixing percs with liquor, I be tweakin'

[Verse 2]
Mixing percs with liquor, I be tweakin'
Shorty on me, got one in the head
Watching moves, make one and you're dead (8-8-8-8-808 Mafia)
I'm just boolin', I just want some bread
I can't snooze, no, I'm out the bed
She gave me head, I got out the bed
Free my big bro Gillie out the feds
He got 20, but he eating good
Rather be dead than without the bread
He just told me, "shorty, don't be tweakin', you know all yo people need you"
I know all these bitches evil
I ain't tryna be her pleaser

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna get some head
Baby, I'm just tryna get some bread
Fuck the haters, I'ma chase a bag
I paid 4K for this Fendi bag
Let her taste the molly, got her tweakin'
She just met Young Sizzle, now she tweakin'
Bitch just seen my pistol, now she tweakin'
Mixing percs with liquor, I be tweakin'
