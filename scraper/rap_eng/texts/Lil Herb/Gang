[Intro: G Herbo]
(Oh my God who is this? L Beats)
We come to your block like the Warriors
We ain't gon' fight, we gon' blow at you
We come to your block like the Warriors
We ain't gon' fight, all my youngins gon' blow at you

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
No you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get changed in this bitch, gang in this bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
All of my young niggas savage
All of my young niggas trappin'
None of my bitches is average
I spit that heat, I'm a dragon
I see the green like the Packers
I ball like the Raptors, you niggas some actors
Your shorty be diggin' the fashion
These niggas hate with a passion

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
They see the way we be cashin'
Mason Margiela so nasty
They know what I keep on my feet
G-Fazos, don't even ask me
Just met a bitch and she sackin'
I think that her name was Ashley
When is your new shit gone drop?
She pissin' me off, steady askin'
I be in the hood and the booth
I hit up the trap and my shows
That's why my shoebox full of rolls
That's why I ain't trippin' on hoes
Still spend a stack on my clothes
And we be on MTV
And we still clappin' these poles
Never come back with your soul

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
No you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get changed in this bitch, gang in this bitch

[Verse 3: G Herbo]
Gang in this bitch, you know how we rockin'
33 shots and we Glockin'
Me and big boss pull up and we fuck off the profit
They hate us, you know 'cause we poppin'
Hundreds, we been gettin' those
Forgiato rims been spinnin' those
Young nigga just tryna get to a check
I ain't chasin' no pussy, I been gettin' hoes
Herbo only smoke out of Phillies and Oâ€™s
1800, a fifth of my clothes
Alexander McQueen all black
But I don't shit with them O's
You know shorty been EBK
So I don't do shit by the code
And don't give a fuck who want smoke
I eat, sleep, and shit with my pole
And right now I'm back in Chiraq
Niggas say they wanna rob me
You think you gonna reach for my jewelry?
You can have it, I hope you let God see
All these 150 demons with me
40's, nickles, and ninas with me
And they slidin' the stainless for me
Red tape on the scene and repeat

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
No you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get changed in this bitch, gang in this bitch

[Verse 4: Lil Bibby]
Bitch, I'm lit, check my fit
Check my wrist, check my bitch
Catch me ridin' with that stick
Talkin' shit, get you hit
Ayy, I'm straight from the Chi, get love in the south
Shawty a five but I'm lovin' her mouth
I got her high, then we fucked on the couch
Nut in her mouth then I kick the bitch out

[Verse 5: G Herbo & Lil Bibby]
Damn what you trippin' about?
You act like you never had dick in your mouth
You all in your feelings, you irri you mad bitch
So what? Yo Uber outside
Glizzys I keep at least two when I ride
Cause niggas be shootin' outside
High off lean, sayin' blockin' off traffic
Like Herbo can you move that coupe that's outside?
I can't see you haters, I'm Stevie
I need the cake bitch, I'm greedy
My new bitch say she gonna leave me
I keep the choppers, believe me
High off them yoppers, I'm breezy
Pull up shoot your block up so easy
And I thought you niggas had money
Why the fuck all their jewelry look cheesy?

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them thangs in this bitch, things in this bitch
No you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get changed in this bitch, gang in this bitch
