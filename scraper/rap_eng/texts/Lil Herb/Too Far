[Intro]
Aye
Young Jefe holmes
God damn, God damn

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
They hatin' on me but that come with bein' a star
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are
I pull out, that my new whip, hopped out leave it in park
Tossed the keys to valet, please don't touch the AR
I came too far, I done came too far
I came too far, I done came too far
Bitch I came too far, bitch I came too far
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Ok I'm with a sexy bitch and she come straight from D.R
Livin' on that Sunday, bottles glow in the dark
My youngest underage, they don't ask them for no card
Walkin' with that pocket rocket right in my sock
Gotta watch out for the bitches tryna show fake love
Bet you be likin' Pixar all of the fake thugs
Watch out for them snitches tryna be cool in the club
How you talkin' bout all these drugs and you never met the plug now
They like what's up heffe, I'm like lil nigga who you?
I'm a big dog and you lil niggas poodles
I done came too far, I'm in meetin's with Lulu
I ain't goin' back to eatin' Oodles and noodles

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
They hatin' on me but that come with bein' a star
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are
I pull out, that my new whip, hopped out leave it in park
Tossed the keys to valet, please don't touch the AR
I came too far, I done came too far
I came too far, I done came too far
Bitch I came too far, bitch I came too far
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Ain't no niggas speak cause niggas know who I be
Big Herbo, don't forget the G, spent 50 thousand on drink
That Act, Hi-Tech, even the Quali bitch cuz i sip lean
Don't talk to me bout pourin' up you started in 2013, lil nigga
And I'm only 19 but this Rollie on me, this a 41
16 had a clip in like 31
Free Gilly out the Feds, he facin' 21
Bitch he a real nigga, didn't tell on anyone
No limit, I do not answer to anyone
I don't owe anyone and I got plenty guns
Glock 23, I keep it on me
And I come to DC, bitch your heffe gon' give me one
And I came way too far for mistakes
Look suspicious,you  get shot in the face
Don't do no Twitter beef
Took a break from the streets
Out of town eating lobsters and steaks, nigga
Remember havin' hotdogs on my plate

[Hook: Shy Glizzy]
They hatin' on me but that come with bein' a star
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are
I pull out, that my new whip, hopped out leave it in park
Tossed the keys to valet, please don't touch the AR
I came too far, I done came too far
I came too far, I done came too far
Bitch I came too far, bitch I came too far
Ain't gotta prove yourself when niggas know who you are
