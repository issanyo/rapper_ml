[Intro: Sonta]
Have you ever rocked with someone
And at some point just realized, like...
What am I doing?
I deserve so much better

[Verse 1: Sonta]
Gave you too many chances
It's like you held my love for ransom
You don't want to let it go 'cause you know what it is
And you know that it is priceless
You know that you will never find another chick
That's gon hold it down like me
That will hold the grounds like me
That will stick around like me
I know I got them bitches mad, but they will never try me
Here to tell you that your time is up, I'm done with you
Here to tell you that I had enough
And even though it's unfortunate
Give my old toys to the less fortunate
Tell them bitches they can have you
And I hope that they be there when it's time to
They gon' use you and abuse you
But I got to show you I ain't scared to lose you
Boy, I'm too through

[Chorus: Sonta]
I used to wanna be your everything
But now I don't wanna be nothing
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And leaving you alone, I dodged a bullet
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And I'ma need for you to keep your distance
Yeah, thought I wasn't gon' find out
That your little hoes love running their mouth
Wanna be a dog and you in the dog house
But this time, you ain't never getting out

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Why you be upset with me, calling me, stressing me? Girl, you know I ain't shit
And I mentioned to you way before, I'm a man of my word, I can't commit before I hit it
I'm honest
And them niggas that hit you before weren't 100
And these bitches in this day and age on the 'Gram living fake, only impressed with money
Good for nothing, I know that they fucking and sucking to earn them a name, I can't trust them
Used to feel like I just wanted something, I got tired of clubbing and being in public
But at least I know I ain't cuffing no hoe
That a nigga gon' fuck on the low
I can't ever pump fake, I'ma keep it a true
If you ain't just for me, that's all I want to know

[Chorus: Sonta]
I used to wanna be your everything
But now I don't wanna be nothing
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And leaving you alone, I dodged a bullet
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And I'ma need for you to keep your distance
Yeah, thought I wasn't gon' find out
That your little hoes love running their mouth
Wanna be a dog and you in the dog house
But this time, you ain't never getting out

[Bridge: Sonta]
Boy, you ain't shit
You ain't no different
Should have listened to my friends
When they said that you would hurt me again
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Boy, you ain't shit
You ain't no different
Should have listened to my friends
When they said that you would hurt me again
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken

[Chorus: Sonta]
I used to wanna be your everything
But now I don't wanna be nothing
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And leaving you alone, I dodged a bullet
'Cause you ain't shit
Boy, you ain't shit
And I'ma need for you to keep your distance
Yeah, thought I wasn't gon' find out
That your little hoes love running their mouth
Wanna be a dog and you in the dog house
But this time, you ain't never getting out

[Outro: Sonta]
Boy, you ain't shit
You ain't no different
Should have listened to my friends
When they said that you would hurt me again
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Boy, you ain't shit
You ain't no different
Should have listened to my friends
When they said that you would hurt me again
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
Now I'm heartbroken, heartbroken, broken, broken
