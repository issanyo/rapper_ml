[Verse]
Big G Herbo, I must say I came a long way
'Member posted on the 8 Block and that hallway
Hustlin' we serving nicks might get six for the dub
Now I need 15 for a show plus my stick in the club
We hit your club 150 deep 150 guns
You know that's about 2000 shots Whips like they straight off the lot
We pull up 50 whips Forgiato rims my coupe got somethin soft on the top
We got your hoe in the passenger but I'm not smashing her
She just know I want the top
Everywhere I go know I tote the GLOCK
Run up and I'm blowing shots
My Rollie a plain and it costs me a block
No Bezel I said, "hold the rocks"
Remember nights I was restless posted on Essex
Toting them jocks ducking shots
Never signed me deal I was out in the field
Over east looking for opps
And my homies ain't never cashed out on a grill
But they had a mouth full of rocks
Me and Lil Bro was sixteen slidin' off pills
No Limit don't know how to chill
Niggas fighting that drama and ain't take a deal
Free Crado, Free James and Free Gill
Gilly call all the time, know I'm on the grind
He just wanna see me run up a mil'
Ayee and I'm right back at it fuck how you feel
Smokin on dope by the pillows and ounces
That Posto shit reek out the seal
When I get it my mood I feel like Deuce Bigalow
On a roll I gotta chill
Everywhere I go in your city foreign hoes wanna freak me like I'm Seal
In Miami the white hoes gettin' off cocaine
I pop me a perc you do yo' thing
And the two seater cocaine
Swervin' through both lanes
Hop out G Fazo no Balmain
Tell lil mama to chill I don't wanna know yo' name
Just let me check out yo' jaw game
Keep the magnum on me never going in raw
But I don't wanna fuck If she ok
When I bust in your face, let Lil Bro slay
Since I cut out the lean it's been Remy, Patron
Smokin' on dope sippin Rozay
Rollin up back to back
Perky's and flats buying up Backwoods for 4 days
And I'm still on the road doing shows to and fro studio
Bitch an off day is no day
While you still tryna study how I pick-n-roll
Bitch I'm up late and I'm making more plays
Ayee and these bitches with me they go both ways
They digging each other and Dusse, I'm getting drunk drinking Rozay
We do what adults do
I ask what they wanna do they say "We gon' do what you say"
And I met her at KOD did that on Monday
Now that ass going up on a Tuesday
