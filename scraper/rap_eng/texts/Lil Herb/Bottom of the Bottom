[Intro]
Ballin Like I'm Kobe the mixtape
150 dreamteam, man
You already know what it is, man
I grinded my way to the top, nigga you already know
No hand outs, nigga
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
From the bottom of the bottoms
It was nothing under me
Now I'm that nigga, everywhere I go and I'm who all the bitches wanna see
Who could ever picture me? When I was broke who ever mentioned me?
2010 you wasn't friends with me, now I'm hot you can't get bands with me
Look how all these bitches stare at me
Come here baby, tell me what you see
Look at all these diamonds on my neck and wrist yeah baby this is like 20 grand a piece
I'm a dog with these hoes got em sucking dick, squatting on their hands and knees
Trying to take the whole 150 overseas we gon' probably need a fleet
But when I think about it probably all my niggas felons
We gon probably need to sneak
People out of town paying me to speak and their charging you to see
Ain't no more 500, no free shit, bitch my jeans cost a G
Plus my ear rings bout a 9 piece and my watch cost a half-a-key
I've been balling since I dropped Fazoland had Cannon referee
And these G Fazos go with everything, buy at least 3 pair a week
And you know for Kob we shoot 24s with 23s on our feet
No Giuseppe kicks or them Louis Vs cop a nice pair of wheats

[Hook]
From the bottom of the bottoms
There was nothing under me
Now  the judge hang us with 100 years, used to hang us by a tree
I was born in the trap tryna stay up out the penitentiary
Cuz living ain't cheap tell me how this the land of the free
(Cuz living ain't cheap how the fuck is this the land of the free)
From the bottom of the bottoms
There was nothing under me
Now  the judge hang us with 100 years, used to hang us by a tree
I was born in the trap tryna stay up out the penitentiary
Cuz living ain't cheap tell me how this the land of the free
(Cuz living ain't cheap how the fuck is this the land of the free)

[Verse 2]
100 niggas on the corner
And they killing shit for me, better not play with me
Never Leave My Brothers til the death of me
79 and Essex when I rest in peace re-up by the week
Baking soda, yolaâ€”that's the recipe
Double rock the D
Come and shop with me, one on top of 3
Profit all I see
Nigga look at me, never on shit
Now I got them keys and I got them ps
Super OGs, never mix shit, I love smoking weed
And I'm off the lean
16 that's when I became a fiend
Spilt a 6 on my Balmain Jeans
1400 now they 17, That's on everything
100 bitches in the club want a wedding ring
I'm so M.O.B. that's over everything
If it ain't money calling Imma let it ring
Keep a bank roll, my shit can't fold
Out here in the rain in a Range Rov
In the same clothes, running late for shows
I can't change clothes til the bank close
G Herbo that youngin' now
'Member youngin' I was running wild
With them killers, we 100 deep
Up on Essex with 100 rounds
And we warring all the time
Lost my niggas, see an opp and we gon gun him down
Show no mercy in the streets they gon remember me
150 at the top and bitch it started-

[Hook]
From the bottom of the bottoms
There was nothing under me
Now  the judge hang us with 100 years, used to hang us by a tree
I was born in the trap tryna stay up out the penitentiary
Cuz living ain't cheap tell me how this the land of the free
(Cuz living ain't cheap how the fuck is this the land of the free)
From the bottom of the bottoms
