[Herb]

I'm a EBK nigga and a No Limit Monsta
If you look wrong get ya face knocked of ya
Bitches call my phone cuz me and Fivee did a song
I just tell her come along, make em bust not a problem
If she come along you know squad gotta bone
100 niggas do her raw then she might need a doctor
Squad get it on, Essex block that's my home
To the Vito Block, you see lights, helicopters
Fuck the police cuz we runnin these streers
You might see me on the ave totin pipes with the rastas
Mally he a rasta, Mally he'll blast
If Mally spot ya, sorry but he got ya
You guys smoking ganja
Lookin for the oppas
RIP ROC, bitch you lookin for the choppa
Shoutout 50 shot
Bullets make him diddy bop
We pull up on any block
And we let them semis spark
We got the city hot cuz we young niggas wildin
Got alotta poles, we addicted to the violence
Pull up on the set, shootin techs with the silence
Bitch nigga won't hear shit, but the sirens
Skeet off, cut the heat off
Tell her hold a deep jaw till my meat soft
Whip started self up like a depot
Pull up on him, all white with his teeth sowed
Like a rich nigga, 17 worth 6 figures
Squad making noise lotta niggas tryna get with us
Keep a small circle cuz he might be a snitch nigga
Team no talking, big poles for a big nigga
Catch me on the road doing, tryna get rich
Or might be with a Folly boy shooting at a brick nigga
Everybody killer, middle fingers to a bitch nigga
Leave him no where, we dont gain, thats my lil nigga
