[Intro]
Oh my god who is this? L Beats

[Hook: Juice WRLD]
Hit the trap phone, I got what he want
He do what he can, I do what he don't
Run up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no
Choppa got a kick bitch, no dojo
Bitch who is this? Got a new phone
Money Otis Hill no group home
Fuck one M bitch I got a few of those
She know I'm a dog, young Cujo

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
Oh my god who is this? L Beats
You know how I'm boming, rifle like a Russian
Gun to your head bitch, concussion
You ain't talkin' bread bitch, no discussion
My gun like a volcano its eruptin'
Causing a ruckus, pissing in public
Young rich nigga don't give a fuck if I want it
He get all the smoke in the world if he want it
I could fuck every hoe in the world if I wanted
Spaz on they ass, rockstar drag no race
Gun with a mag, I ain't ever catchin' no case
No way, 3K for the coke bitch
Andre, backwoods for the dope bitch
Always

[Hook: Juice WRLD]
Hit the trap phone, I got what he want
He do what he can, I do what he don't
Run up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no
Choppa got a kick bitch, no dojo
Bitch who is this? Got a new phone
Money Otis Hill no group home
Fuck one M bitch I got a few of those
She know I'm a dog, young Cujo

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Oh my god who is this? L Beats
She know I'm a dog, call me blue nose
Call me red nose, no not Rudolph
Pulled up in a Lambo, took my roof off
You ain't even gon' put your mans on, nigga how you a boss
And I don't even choose to floss, [?] use the sauce
And it don't matter what we did to win cause the losers lost
Imma probably pull up in that SRT again but Imma get the hawk
Niggas broke as fuck can't speak on what I'm doing today you don't get to talk
And I walk that talk, why you niggas talk
Balenciaga and G Fazo ooh thats how I walk
If you talkin' bout [?] my M's you can play with a few of those
I ain't gon' catch you out like him, Imma pay for this Uber tho

[Hook: Juice WRLD]
Hit the trap phone, I got what he want
He do what he can, I do what he don't
Run up, put a bullet in his dome, oh no
Choppa got a kick bitch, no dojo
Bitch who is this? Got a new phone
Money Otis Hill no group home
Fuck one M bitch I got a few of those
She know I'm a dog, young Cujo

[Outro: Juice WRLD]
Bitch who is this? Got a new phone
Money Otis Hill no group home
Fuck one M bitch I got a few of those
She know I'm a dog, young Cujo
