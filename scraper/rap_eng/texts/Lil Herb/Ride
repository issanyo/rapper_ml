[Verse 1]
G Herbo that's my name
Where I come from brazy
I seen way more shit in shootouts
But it never phased me
My little lessons made me
Mama, Essex raised me
I might take the easiest route
But I'm never lazy
I get fly like the first day of school
Freshest nigga in the room
Bitches seem to lose cool when they see me
Although I'm a cool dude
Trick her mind, spit her lines
Get behind, block her line
Fooled you
Bitches love to run their mouth
To see what they can figure out, blues clues
I'm just tryna stack green 'til I get a big amount
Blues too
Fuck her good, getting head
Pop a perc, show you what them blues do
And if it ain't getting money
Bet not ever let a nigga accuse you
Stay a 100, play your role, draw the line
Don't let no nigga abuse you
Fucking hoes, counting money
Fresh as fuck, that shit's just to use you
Gangways, traphouses, shootings
That's the type of shit I'm used to
Fill the sprite with a deuce
But I don't drink that shit no more, I used to
In the hood, everyday, tryna smoke my day away
I used to
Sipping lean, everyday, tryna take my pain away
I used to
Niggas stay in your lane, yeah this 30 I know how to use too
Right before you get in my ride
I need to know you gon' ride
Told her lets go for a ride
I got a chauffeur to drive

[Hook]
Right before you get in my ride
I need to know you gon' ride
Come out and go for a ride
Nowhere to go on a ride?
You can come jump in the ride with me
Only if you wanna ride
Tell me where you wanna ride with me
Only if you gonna ride
Let me know is you gon' ride?
I'm ready if you gon' ride
Right before you get in the ride with me
I need to know if you gon' ride
Cuz I got the chopper inside
I got my shit up inside
But I cannot get you to ride
Just hit me when you wanna ride

[Verse 2]
You know I'm probably in traffic, I'm boolin
Just hit me when you wanna ride
She text me I know how you riding
Be careful, just hit me when you go inside
You know I'm cautious
Gambled and took all my losses
Now I eat lunches with the bosses
No I'm not flossing
I ran it up at all costs
Tour from Aurora to Austin
And I been my own boss
Independent, i don't know what yall thought
'Member having long talks with myself
Like I'm on a phone call
I wish I had a phone call I could make to
My niggas long gone
Still wouldn't take back shit we did
& I know it was all wrong
I got some pain in me
I'm never showing it
I was stressing and pouring it
Dropping a four in it
I'm not supporting it
I was addicted, I'm not ignoring it
Swipe up the Porsche a bit
Don't want no more of it
5 in the morning, I'm the studio
Smoking, recording
Hop out the back of the foreign whip
Whenever someone chauffeuring it
You can't afford it
Haha, your life is boring
This the world we were born in
Go out and explore in it

[Hook]
Right before you get in my ride
I need to know you gon' ride
Come out and go for a ride
Nowhere to go on a ride?
You can come jump in the ride with me
Only if you wanna ride
Tell me where you wanna ride with me
Only if you gonna ride
Let me know is you gon' ride?
I'm ready if you gon' ride
Right before you get in the ride with me
I need to know if you gon' ride
Cuz I got the chopper inside
I got my shit up inside
But I cannot get you to ride
Just hit me when you wanna ride
