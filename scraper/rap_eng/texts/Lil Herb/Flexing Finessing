[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Flexing, finessing. Bitches know I'm flexin
Sipping on that Texas. Kush smoke for breakfast
30s for my weapon. Try me it get hectic
Shooters they just wet shit. Kill you in a second
Flexing, finessing, bitches know I'm flexing
Flexing, finessing, bitches know I'm flexing
Flexing, finessing, bitches know I'm flexing
Flexing, finessing, bitches know I'm flexing

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Flexing, Finessing, these bitches know I'm flexing
30 clip in that weapon, loud pack no stressing
3 bands for the necklace, Gucci belt cost 350
The opps don't wanna see Bibby, neva lacking keep heat with me
Niggas know I'm the best out, my lil niggas bring the techs out
Louis kicks when I step out now that's flexing
No Limit we reckless, ride up and just wet shit
That .40 leave yo chest hit, shit can get hectic
Riding round with the bass knocking, RayBans them the hater blockers
I'm gettin' money I make commas, 8 shooters that's 8 doctors
And all them got hollow tips they let shoot we dropping shit
No Limit, MB, fuck the opposite. I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Fuck her then I kick her out, get back to my riches
Keep bitches out my business, See me I'm never slipping
Pull up when you slipping, yo body drop I'm dipping
Catch me in the kitchen, stretchin' I'm tryna get it
Stretcher in the back and lil folks nem tryna hit it
Anywhere the licks at, you know I'm tryna hit it
Coolin' in the projects
4 bricks up in my closet, 10 bands up in my pocket
Niggas say they real but they fake, you gotta watch em
Niggas say they want beef but really they gon' squash it
No talking I'ma pop it, just ask yo bitch I'm popping
On Twitter I'm the topic
I don't do no fussing, just try me I'ma bust it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Herb]
Hit the club 100 deep, all these bands on me
Bitches watching, jocking, stopping, tryna dance on me, No ID I'm VIP
Hit the scene them hoes go insane
Pull up in the Range they eat the dick before I know they name
But they still know who I be, Lil Herbie they know wassup
Sipping purple in this cup, sweep of purple in this blunt
Fredo off that, turn up, he got that .30 in the cut
Tryna act tough let the Macs bust leave him burnt up in the dust
I stay sacked up that's a must, I be packed up like a bus
I get pack rush when I puff
My team balling hard y'all fouling out better back up or get dunked
Bitch you flexing hard and we wilding out
Might fuck around and get trunked, so don't fuck around and get slumped
