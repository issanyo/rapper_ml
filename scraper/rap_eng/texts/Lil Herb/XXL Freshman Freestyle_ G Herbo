Roaches, rats in apartments, mama smoking, baby starving
Pistols loading, discharging, I grew up in all it
Ghetto, hell, slums, bottom, what you wanna call it?
Nobody role models, everybody alcoholics
The shorties either gangbanging or they basketballin’
Where niggas get left slain stankin’ ‘cause they chain swangin’
Them kids won’t see they moms again ‘cause homie ain’t aimin’
Damn the streets changing, these lil niggas dangerous
Don’t even mask up no more, these lil niggas brainless
I got so many fallen loved ones, nigga out here painless
Don’t know when it’s my time to go, I keep that, I’ma flame it
Want to see me dead or broke, I know I need that motivation
Like if I blow my shot, lose everything I got
Have my hand out on that block, become everything I’m not
Been through that life, I blew that check, lost everything I had
That shit just left me looking silly and my mama sad
No nigga ever gave me shit when I was down bad
I was by myself in a six foot room right there on my ass
And now I stack that shit and mean it, like I’m on my last
I stay so low from fuck niggas like they on my ass
You know if I don’t fuck with you, better not cross my path
Niggas think it’s sweet, they see me in the streets, I been in my bag
Got to stay lowkey but I can’t wait to let ‘em feel my wrath
Still trained to go, could start doing backstrokes in a bloodbath
We wake up, flame up, pop up, post up
Steal dope, clap folks, crack jokes
Still ain’t sad, kill us some white folks
Fuck those if it ain’t real black though
Started getting real money, I was 17
I’m 20 now, I’ma take it way back though
4th grade I was tryna be Ivo
Shooting ball, playing ‘round, saying raps though
Grab my school shit, been throwing L’s up
Never knew what we all headed out for
Young niggas having real life shootouts
By my grandma house, had to move out
Started rapping, wasn’t tryna be a star
I was speaking what I lived, what I knew ‘bout
17 had labels tryna sign me
Thought might as well speak, so I flew out
Flew back, had to see what I was worth
Hit the studio, I know what I’ma do now
Meanwhile tryna make it in a warzone
Matter fact, let me hold that thought
My city know I ain’t even got to talk
Pull up, hop out, white chalk
Now you see me, smell money when I walk
Humble with it, no I ain’t tryna floss
Every real street nigga took a loss
Took a few, bounced back, shook it off
Had an X by my name, took it off
150, dream team, I’m the boss
I came from gambling, totin’, rollin’
Stolen transportation, police stations
Look at me now, tell me congratulations
