[Intro]
Lil Mexico, yeah, ayo, Mexico, uh huh

[Chorus: Z Money]
There's no flodgin', 80 thousand, damn, I need to stop it
200 grams inside my closet, I ain't even lock it
You can't keep up, lil homie, don't try to stop it
My diamonds playin' hockey, F&N sit right beside me
Yeah, hop out the vans and you know foenem slidin'
They say Z Money cook the dope, I do it every time
My wrist froze, it shine, bust it down, now I can't tell the time
Heard you dropped a dime, little dots, it shot at your eye

[Verse 1: Key Glock]
Let them bullets fly, no disguise, I'm one of a kind
All my diamonds cryin', hypnotized, you look hard to blind
80 for my time, I ain't lyin', look how this shit shine
30 for my smile, I ain't lyin', look how this shit shine
Bitch, yeah, I'm on my grind, yeah, that's all the time
Thick ho so fine, had to break her spine
Chopsticks and 45s, better go hide
Young nigga been rich, never had to sign

[Chorus: Z Money]
There's no flodgin', 80 thousand, damn, I need to stop it
200 grams inside my closet, I ain't even lock it
You can't keep up, lil homie, don't try to stop it
My diamonds playin' hockey, F&N sit right beside me
Yeah, hop out the vans and you know foenem slidin'
They say Z Money cook the dope, I do it every time
My wrist froze, it shine, bust it down, now I can't tell the time
Heard you dropped a dime, little dots, it shot at your eye

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Uh, uh, see my uncle cookin' dope up, I was just a toddler
Cut the heat off, I had school, we both was boilin' water
Uh, uh, and dropped out of school, but I was still a scholar
Uh, 6am, hopped out Impalas, shot a boy in collar
Well respected, might just slide through your hood just to give a holler
And connected, shit'll make your jaw lock, shout out to the guala
Used to be that nigga, walk up to you like, "Give me a dollar"
Now I got them blocks, my homies distribute, I'm Iguodala
And I'm really No Limit, but I ain't Mystikal, I ain't rapin', nada
Finger fuck, I rape the chopper, yellow tape, chalk up your partner
Huh, we was really doin' walkups, huh, so what you doin' all that talk for?
And, bro, you best hope you don't fall on the floor, guarantee you'll never get off of it

[Chorus: Z Money]
There's no flodgin', 80 thousand, damn, I need to stop it
200 grams inside my closet, I ain't even lock it
You can't keep up, lil homie, don't try to stop it
My diamonds playin' hockey, F&N sit right beside me
Yeah, hop out the vans and you know foenem slidin'
They say Z Money cook the dope, I do it every time
My wrist froze, it shine, bust it down, now I can't tell the time
Heard you dropped a dime, little dots, it shot at your eye
