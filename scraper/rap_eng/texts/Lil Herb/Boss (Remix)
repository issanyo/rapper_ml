[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Word around I'm a underground
Now they heard the kid just got signed
Had to put myself first niggas after mine
They know I'm hot as a mothafucka you could be a sucka Wouldn't love him if he was my valentine
I'm on every plug up in the clubs
Thuggin' ain't no ducking when I say it's hammer time
Niggas acting like bitches
Got me feeling like I walked in a gay bash
Holding on too, my money long
Boy you better come up with a late pass
I'll never change even with the fame
No fake titties, no fake ass
And I don't get enough credit
So now these rappers gotta pay cash
And I bling more than I walk around
I just took a trip to like three cities
Can you be in my VIP, call him V.I.C
Don't be silly
Got the block asking who fucking with me
And then the white fans yelling "G-Willie"
You a lost pup and I'm bossed up
Now these niggas gotta call me D Diddy
Let's get it

[Hook]
I stopped counting haters, I got way too many
Always talking bands but you ain't breaking any
I know bitches hating but why Niggas envy?
Quit in any city, bitch who fucking with me
I'ma fucking boss I'ma fucking boss (x4)

[Verse 2. Lil Herb]
It's G Herbo
I'm the only Mack without a Cadillac
I be counting racks
Smoking out the pound
Rollin' back to back like I got cataracts
And this Mac-11 go rat-a-tat
I'll change a nigga like matter of fact
And I changed flows after Kill Shit
So I birthed rap niggas after that
And at any moment, I can kill shit
Then come back and body shit after that
Drop a deuce when I wake up
Then pour up another four after that
Purple drank on like I'm Pimp C
So you know I gotta have the Act to nap
Kobe squad no NBA ain't no 78th
Bitch I'm hacking Shaq
And the label meets with my skully on nigga
Nah I ain't with the rapper act
I'm a rap nigga but I don't rap beef
Nah, I won't act how the rappers act
I be in the streets if you looking for me
Hanging where them killers and the trappers at
Fo'nem really out here smokin' shit
They ain't blowing hits, you ain't clapping back
And we EBK, no nigga over here controlling shit
We ain't having that
Let a nigga try to blitz some
We gonna throw some bullets in his Packers cap
I be off the shits so you know them killas
Gotta watch my back
Niggas with me in the studio don't know how to rap

[Hook]
I stopped counting haters, I got way too many
Always talking bands but you ain't breaking any
I know bitches hating but why Niggas envy?
Quit in any city, bitch who fucking with me
I'ma fucking boss I'ma fucking boss (x4)
