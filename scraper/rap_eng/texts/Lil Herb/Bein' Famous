[Intro]
Homeboy flexin' to his bitch sayin' he know me, know he lyin'
He been whinin' the whole time
His bitch want me to stay over, I ain't got the time

[Hook]
Homeboy flexin' to his bitch, sayin' he know me but I know he lyin'
And, I been fucked his bitch and he been whinin' the whole time
And, his bitch want me to stay over but baby I ain't go the time
And, I told her hold my guap first, she said "Baby do your thing"
And, I can't trust these niggas, so that's why I keep my thang with me
And if you ain't with the street shit, don't get your ass cooked, nigga just for hangin'
And a lot of these niggas start gettin' a little money, then they get to changin'
I'd rather have this money and my niggas with me, shit fuck bein' famous

[Verse 1: Capo]
I'd rather, rather have this money and my niggas with me, shit fuck bein' famous
A lot of niggas talk a lot of shit, so them guns get to aimin'
My niggas don't bullshit, lots of men we bangin'
If you ain't with the street shit, don't get cooked just for hangin'
Pull up on a fuck nigga block and them shots get to ringin'
Sneak dissin' to that bitch, and my phone get to ringin'
Rappin' just to get Slick out, I ain't tryna get famous
[?]
[?] firin' the K, and y'all niggas, y'all fake
Cause I'm gettin' money, fuck nigga and that's the reason y'all hate
Boy play your place with me
Flexin' to your bitch like you the nigga, boy stay away from me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'd rather have this money and my niggas with me, fuck bein' famous
Hit the club with the gang, totin' 30s and them thangs, we armed and dangerous
And we gang bangin', don't get changed man
We ain't like y'all rappin' ass niggas, got hammers on us, we aimin'
Young nigga I came up from nothin', that's why I'm 'bout a sack
Start finessin', I'm playin' with these racks and I don't know how to act
Remember me, Kobe, Capo, and Duwop was on the block gettin' off the act
RIP Kobe, me and Duwop, Boss, Cap gettin' off the act
We leanin', we dozin' off a four
Bro still got a 30 up on his head, run up we gon' blow
"What happened to them niggas?" We don't know
Tryin' to stack my digits, ain't flexin' for no hoes
