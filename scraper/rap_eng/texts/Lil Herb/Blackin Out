[Verse 1: G Herbo]
'member I was selling packs for the low
I wake up and thank the lord that I ain't trapping no mo'
Niggas don't be on they block so we ain't clapping no mo'
But just like we was in a war I still be strapped with it though
30s they wait on me right at the telly everytime I'm traveling though
And I want 20k for a show, 10 or 15 what I'm averagin' though
My big brother be copping them O's 10 or 15 what he averagin' though
Yay he usually be breaking them down but that's 50k if you grabin' them hoe

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby & G Herbo]
I heard you got your chain snatched then you snitched on a nigga
So you can't go to your hood cause you switched on your niggas
I got niggas in the prison you can ask them how they living
If they tell you that they eating everyday like thanksgiving
If you see that nigga with the squad treat him like a god
I ain't never cracked a card, I was out trapping hard
Junkies knocking at my door but everything sold out
Think 'bout running in my trap it's guns in the whole house
So you acting like a bitch you steady running your mouth
I should slap him with the 45 knock him cold out
Ambulance have to pick him up, he get rolled out
Bibby nice you playing with G Herbo you get blowed down
