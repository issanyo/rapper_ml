(Verse 1 Lil Herb)
Aye...
Came up in the hood I'm wit all my niggas grinding
Murder my lifestyle we was war and never mind it
Posted on the 9 while its cracking never hiding
No limit MB we sliding
Niggas know thats homocide bitch
Go back to '09 only day ones who I ride wit
Shoot outs all the time them the same niggas I might die wit
Same niggas I was broke wit them same young niggas i shine wit
Now work feel like the cases wit the same niggas I was lying wit
And only time we lie is in investigations
No talking made it out them bitches wit no hesitation
I was on the block i ain't give a fuck about no education
Now if you wanna see G Herbo make a reservation
Lil nigga addicted to them foams that was medication
But I cut my habit I’m just smoking dopes and meditating
Gotta keep that ratchet can’t trust niggas cause i know they hate me
Yeah ima body a fuck nigga and claim no relations
Steading making bonds, fighting cases im like fuck the jakes
Know I keep them bitches right on me in every fucking state
Everything I wanted went and took it nigga fuck the stakes
Im in STL banging L’s and I fuck wit stape
Huh

(Hook Stape)
Aye
Been wit my niggas from the start so we strong now
And for my niggas dead and gone ima hold it down
And bitch i made it to the top cause we on now
Cause we on now
Cause we on now
I told my momma no more struggles we gone now
And all these niggas know im coming its on now
I put my life all on the line
So its on now
Yeah its on now
Yeah its on now

(verse 2 Stape)
Young nigga i was made for this
Almost every night yeah i prayed for this
Big dreams we extend shit
And my brothers wit me no friend shit
Coming up we ain't have shit
And now herb wit me wanna slide in
Bad bitches let me dive in
And bro snatch the mac make em hide in
How he real when he ain't did nothing?
Ima boss up and put my mans on
Catch a stain now then mans down
People snatch me up then my head gone
Living life you can’t get it back
So I go and get it all on my own
Fuck niggas
I dont trust bitches
I stay down and my paper long
Started off we was dream chasing
Im next to get
Straight from the trenches
This for my niggas i stay committed
My momma stressing and praying
But its the way im living
And i know so many doubted me
This the way they listen
Me and cesar in traffic
Trapping in any condition
And niggas beef to get established
My niggas coming wit it
I know we gone make it out of it
I can’t wait to finish
Look what i did for my family
Can’t forget my niggas
Aye
Stayed down and i came up
Just a young nigga wit his change up
Money come but can’t change us
Speak to real niggas gotta name us
T’ing in where its dangerous
Homicide know im down to ride
When its crunch time i don’t name nothin'
