Rick Rock:
Livin' in denial got you stressin' in your sleep
It's been like this awhile you ain't what you used to be
And there is no one no where that could tell
That things aren't what they seem
Cause in your mind this is how it's s'posed to be..
Keep denyin' everything

The Grouch:
You found a path off the track and you followed that
And now you lack what you had I can't swallow that
You were my friend till the end now you're hollowed out
I put the pad to the pen I'll tell all about
The smiles a cover up, just like the glasses are
Now you ain't hit the wall, just gone too fast to fall
You barely laugh no more, I think you dodge my calls
What's the problem? you say "nuthin at all..."
Like im bustin your balls, but im watchin you fall
Feelin rotten and forgotten stress all in your jaw
Bloodshot droopy eyes groupies ride but no car
Some of the saddest shit that I witnessed so far

Eligh:
Either i, overdose in a alleyway with no friends and no family
Count on me just to be useless toothless homeless not a heart in anatomy
Maybe I get my act together get clean
Make amends makin friends with a new scene
New life, new eyes with a new gleam
New nikes, all white, new shoe strings
But i'd, rather get high cause I need to get by
Cause it hurts my body to wait
Opiates got a hold of my brain
It's a whole nother thang
It's a cold little game that I demonstrate
Man I know they dont understand all the waves that im goin through
All alone in a room full of people smokin they weed drinkin they booze
If they only knew what they homie was doin
It might just ruin a vision of honor to a goner
Ate alive in a Jeffrey Dahmer fashion
Crashin through walls im smashin
Through like a runaway train
In the nose straight into the vein
My life was so insane but now I can't complain
Cause now im living clean its like im living a dream
Used to be a fiend
My fans had no idea I leaned To the darkness
Heart was hardened Hardened by my God on trial
Single file walkin through that hell no longer in denial

The Grouch:
Moon did time to reinvent like Doom did
An 8 headed monster dead weight who ruined it
Underground sound they really influenced it
Can't run around town too silly soon booin' it
Im tired of gluin' it fire the truant kids
A man up stand up straighter we doin this
Started it righteous now part of it's lifeless
Man this ain't the art of it to me it's just hard to get past C+
Weak us? not my staff
Step back at least enough to see what we had
Now add what we shoulda to see why im mad
Dont forget the coulda woulda while it's free fallin fast
