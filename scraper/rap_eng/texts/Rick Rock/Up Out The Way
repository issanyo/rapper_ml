[Intro: E-40]
I'm in my 7 deuce Cutlass with the slap in the back
With the slap in the back, with the slap in the back...

[Xzibit]
I got that rag top Impala with the brains blew back
With the brains blew back, with the brains blew...

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I got that rag top Impala with the brains blue back
Could you loan me a dollar? Bitch, I can't do that
Got a flight in an hour, got my bags all packed
Bring it in for the huddle a hundred and fifty racks, POW!
Want me to take it to the club and throw it on the ground?
Instead I take it buy a business, make it double down
I'm back in business, you pussy niggas in trouble now!
Shake, what you gon' shake the city?
Clearly you are from outta town
I'm in my scraper, catching paper on the turf
Stackin' yaper like a Laker, hit exactly where it hurts
Better put that shit in reverse, you might cross over the ledge
The king of the castle swingin' screamin' "off with their heads!"
Round up and wrangle your ratchets
Mad cause they given us action
Fuck em', we keep em', we mackin'
Don't need them nigga, what's happenin'?
What is it? Let's get it crackin'! Millions and millions reacting
Focused, no longer distracted, put it down, let's see you match it

[Hook: E-40 & Xzibit]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day
All day, all day, all day, all day...
If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way, out the way...

[Verse 2: E-40]
X, let me spit at them, mane
They done awoken a sleeping dragon
Now the roof is on fire, let the motherfucker burn
The fire marshall came in when it was my turn
Everybody up in here spazzin'
Higher than a hippie, crunk and hella pissy
Everybody tipsy, feelin' hecka tripy- my wrist real brisky icy
Bitch made niggas don't like me
'Cause they wife want me to pipe, she...
Been on me since 1990
Body, boomin', I be tycoonin'
Me and a few of my goons and alcohol consumin'
Born and raised in the grip
Where a fiend will sneak up on you try and hit you for a hit
Better pack a extra clip
'Cause niggas ain't playin', niggas really with the shit
Ballin' like rawlings
Or should a pimp say like spaulding
All I hear is money callin'
Thousands on thousands on thousands
Flatlands, public housing - real talk player, no Jones
All about my allowance - need a money counter just to count it
Sheesh, capiche? I'm heavy off in these streets
UFC front seats - no famine man, we feast

[Hook: E-40 & Xzibit]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day
All day, all day, all day, all day...
If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way, out the way...

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Let's get whatever you drinkin' and drink it by the case
Then let me pound on your pussy and knock it outta place
I wanna hook you and book you, hand you some time to face
While we vacate in a destination for motivation. Hey!
Separate hundreds from fifties - ball it up, bring it all with me
Callin' a audible hit me, I'm open, never forget me
Down shift, punch it, approaching 160
I'm clowning like Barnum and Bailey bouncing around the city
Pity you feelin' shitty, this 25 to lifer is pushing a Spyker
Get anybody hit by a sniper
Live the rest of your life in a diaper or chill the fuck out
Or you can walk, better keep walkin' or they can carry you out
This is the end of the drought, homies is bouncing around me
Too many zeros to count. I let these women surround me
Jump off their clothes dig 'em out, but then they never can find me
Holding unholy amounts, already showed you the route, c'mon

[Hook: E-40 & Xzibit]
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
I'm a rich ass nigga, you's a bitch ass nigga
Stacking money to the ceiling, getting paid all day
All day, all day, all day, all day...
If you ain't tryna get it, better get up out the way
Out the way, out the way, out the way, out the way...
