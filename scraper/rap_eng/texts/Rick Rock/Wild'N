We in this muhfucker wild'n wild'n
I'm with my COB folks on my coast
We turned all the way up, homie the knob broke yeah
We out here wild'n wild'n
My nigga we wild'n wild'n
These bitches be wild'n they wild'n
Yeah we all wild'n wild'n
Okay, I'm scheming on a beach with an ass like damn
Got that ringer on my hip, it go blat blat bam
If you drink then pour up, if you smoke weed then roll up
Got so much drink in my cup I think I'm bout to throw up

[Verse 1: Julius Luciano]
I'm turned up like Fonzy's collar, yeah my crew be talkin' shit
Turn this club into a drop top, tear the roof up off this bitch
I think I'm finna get so drunk, you know what Drake, I'm on one
I be on that Ace, you can say that I'm on one
Yeah, I'm a boozer, no Carlos, got floozies by the carloads
She got a boyfriend, she gonna lose hers
Losers what we call those lame ass niggas who be crowdin' these whores
Nigga you ain't wild, you's a bore, I'm a beast, wild as a boar
My niggas way live, stay fried, like my gang tryin' to get kicked out
I see a gang of broads, stage side, I might stage dive with my dick out
I slid up in her party with my makeshift knife
I'm about that life like [?], my nigga I can't get [?]

[Verse 2: Demetrius Capone]
I might walk up in that strip club with a condom on
Fuck a lap dance, I'm tryin' to bone, fuck that bitch to Rihanna's song
Throw it up, throw it up, my dick anaconda long
A picture of my dick is the screensaver on your baby momma phone
I give her a call, tell her to wear a skirt with no drawls
Now I'm liftin' up her frame cuz I'm nailin' her on the wall
My game's stupid like retards, I don't need loot to get these broads
I can make it rain EBT cards and still leave with your sweetheart
You know this thug wildin' told y'all I'm an assaholic
It's like you butt dialin' cuz now your ass is callin'
That's what I call a booty call, I'm in her ear like that sloth
I told her my dick was contagious and she caught it

[Hook: Julius Luciano]

[Verse 3: Kenny]
I'm on that juice that make you turn up, turn up juice
I'm on that juice that make you turn up, turn up juice
I feel there's no way you're fuckin' with me, go away quit fuckin' with me
No way you're fuckin' with me, go away quit fuckin' with me
Oh shit, I'm drinkin' like some kind of alcoholic
I'm feelin' like there's absolutely no way you're fuckin' with me
Go away quit fuckin' with me, no way you're fuckin' with me, go away quit fuckin' with me
I puff green, I can't quit man, do it day and night
Light up trees, my new nickname should be Christmas lights
You don't think your boy's cuttin' tonight you want somethin'
I'll make her orgasm in her crib, that's homecoming

[Verse 4: Andrew 'Dice' Dinero]
When I hit the club, it's shinin' time
I don't need no icy watch, I'm pipin' hot
Bitches cuz my team is scorching, pipin' hot
C.O.B is worldwide, y'all know how we do it
It's like your team is sterilized, y'all ain't got no movement
If niggas wanna start some shit, we ain't trippin'
We don't give a motherfuck or a D-A-M-N
When the beef is crackin' I'mma clap this llama
Braow, put this back to drama
I'm wild'n, I'm a street fighter, hit a nigga with a hundred hands, that's E. Honda
Shoe Gang is heatin' up, sauna lover, stackin' dollars
We about bread, bitches, beef in that order, Scrappy's momma
We so rough, we so loud, so what, we so foul
When we show up, we show out, shown up, we so wild
