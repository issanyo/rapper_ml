[Verse 1]
What you hatin’ for, nigga? We started off with the sun
I kept it thorough while you fucked around, played yourself out the game
Going against the grain, I don’t, I maintain my solidness, mayne
Sucker shit, I want it to come back and bite you, mayne
I’m off the Sluricane right now and it’s working, I’m getting tipsy
Whiskey, my eyes red, same color as a hickey
Sticky dew icky, that’s what I smoke for my pain
The struggle, the trouble, the memory in my brain
I grew up around real ones and bullshitters
Had to cut a couple of ‘em off like some scissors
Gotta be on point, can’t be dragging your feet and acting lost
Don’t be snoozing and sneezing, my nigga, cattin’ off
Like a jumping spider, keep a set of extra eyes
So we can coming, element of the surprise
Niggas ain’t got no problem taking niggas’ lives
Don’t protect your pumpkin, they’ll it into pumpkin pie

[Hook]
The bitch in my left ear telling me some shit that this hoe ass nigga just said
Same nigga that she talking ‘bout in my right ear like ‘Nigga, let’s get this bread’
Ol’ hoe ass nigga
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)

[Verse 2]
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’
Why the fuck you worried about how much money this player making?
Why the fuck you concerned the way I talk to my bitch?
Why the fuck is your sneaky ass all up in a pimp mix?
Why you gotta tell my broad that I be cheating, you snitch?
If we was the only ones left on Earth, you would push me off a cliff
This one of them uptempo, hyphy Rick Rocker type of slaps
Make me fuck around and grow my dreads back
My follow-up game is on point, I’m having my yen
Return phone calls and you will keep your friends
Free all of my folks behind them walls in the pen
I took all of my ones and went and bought me a Benz
Left the stickers on the windows and the tires
Fresh off the car lot, zero miles
All of my block baboons, they mannish and they mainey
Hunting rifles, they’ll shoot you like Dick Cheney (BLAOW!)

[Hook]
The bitch in my left ear telling me some shit that this hoe ass nigga just said
Same nigga that she talking ‘bout in my right ear like ‘Nigga, let’s get this bread’
Ol’ hoe ass nigga
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)

[Verse 3]
Get somewhere where they love you at, mark
You ain’t welcome around this side of the Earth
You ain't’ liked around these parts
You ain’t never did nothing to help nobody
You ain’t never did nothing to help the kids
All you do is stir up mess and stay in people business
Get your life ol’ ass nigga, I’m out here pushing these raps
What you doing besides hating? What have you done for the map?
You a plague, you a germ, you a fungus without a doubt
Ain’t got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out
They desperate these days, do anything for money
Eight times out of ten, it don’t be your friends, it be they company
That’ll leave a door unlocked and set you up for the take
Leave a window, let ‘em enter your escape
Look at the way that I carry myself, you can tell I’m a factor
I’m having my yaper, I’m thorough, that nigga right there don’t matter
And it’s a reason why he don’t doubt, ‘cause he ain’t got nothin’ to count
‘Cause he broke, hoping I get murked or croaked

Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
Nigga, quit hatin’ on me
Bitch nigga, quit hatin’ on me (Bitch nigga, quit hatin’)
