[E-40]
My killers don't take out dopefiends, my killers take out factors
My killers ain't even from out here dude
My killers some out-of-town freelancers
Professional henchmen with hella hot ones up under they belt
Broccolis up under they belt
A gang of solid murder beefs up under they belt
"Forty, there go that nigga
That sold you that half-a-cake last week on the set"
You mean that swivel that synthetic dope
That ripped me, that shit that was wet? Yeah
Don't even look over there, act like we ain't trippin
The the next few days, potnah came up missin
See a lot of these niggas bitch up
And crack under pressure when it's time to be facin
Get to bumpin they gums, rollin over
Breakin the rules and regulations
Boy I tell you not stickin to the script
Will get that jacket put on yo' ass for life
What jacket? That snitch jacket:
That reliable source, that rat, that head, that mice
That's why we can't be talkin and bein all careless on these phones
I know technology now
Allows po'-po' to look inside walls and see inside homes
I know all I was tryin to do
Is buy my little daughter a brand new pair of Jordans
That's important, but you gotta remember
To stay one step ahead of the law enforcement
Be sharp with yo' shit
Keep yo' business to yourself and don't get sloppy
Talk in pig-latin keep you employees
Piz-osted with choppers and walkie-tizznalkies
Fall on yo' ass, have wisdom, use your brain
Auction off yo' assets nigga, sell yo' trophy, sell yo' Mustang
You know what that bring? Ching ching
Playa potnah motherfucker dude that's some mail
Convertible top, black on black interior, exterior
He gon' be worth about twelve
Talkin about you was savin it for your little nephew to scatter
Nigga don't you know anything over 20 years old is a classic?

Chorus: E-40 (repeat 4X)

These are the things you need to know (The rules and regulations)

[E-40]
Uhh, you're 'posed to, you're 'posed to
Play that damn game like it's supposed to be plinayed
Always keep a bucket full of battery acid
To throw yo' dope in just in case they raid
That way they can't prosecute your residence
Cause you done been already got rid of all the evidence
Tryin to get a BUCK -- a BUCK?
A soup pot, a blender and a measurin cup
In my section eight appartment COMPLEX
Pissy MATTRESS, and dirty CARPETS
"Nephew, did you get my message?"
Yeah I got yo' message; you told me to clean up behind myself
And scrape the residue up off the edges
"What else?" Always look over my headrest and my rearview zone
Cause triflin be skanless and the skanless might try to follow me home
Never tell a motherfucker what time you gon' cop or come back through
Throw they ass off a bit - come back within the next day or two
I don't need no cowards, just warriors on my team
I don't sell coke no more dude, I sell mescaline

Regulation #5: when it's a drought nigga park yo' feet
Regulation #6: fuck 12 in a box, hold court street
Regulation #7: don't take yo' business to where you livin
Regulation #8: keep yo' heat but fly straight
(The rules and regulations)

Chorus

[E-40]
BLOWED, pushin numbers on the dial-tone
Took a swig of my 40 but I forgot I had the cap still on
Look to my left and asked, honey for a light
She looked at me and said, baby you alright?
I said I'm cool, but ain't this shit supposed to relax us?
Fired up a Newport, but I accidentally lit it backwards
For some strange reason I had a feelin
That that hood-ho bitch was sneaky
Come to find out this bitch done laced my weed and slipped me a mickey
Now I'm feelin sweaty..
Eyelids gettin heavy..
Stomach feelin queasy.. {*YAWWWWN*}
All of a sudden, now I'm slee-py
Woke up naked, slowly regainin my memory
Well where did they find you? Around the corner from Applebee
Over there by Costco, right there off the freeway
Admiral Callaghan Lane, yeah! Right next door to Safeway
Stripped me clean, got me for some G's
Set me up, stole my car keys
Guess that's the consequences when you sellin that D
Shit, next time I bet I take my drink to the bathroom with me

Regulation #9: checking those that get out of line
Regulation #10: don't sell yo' soul if you hit the pen
Regulation #11: keep yo' hooptie hot and revvin
Regulation #12: keep enough to pay your lawyer bills
(The rules and regulations)
