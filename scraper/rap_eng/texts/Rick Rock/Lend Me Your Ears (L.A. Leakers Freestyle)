[Verse: Kurupt]
Headed for the mass rack mob
And put my mask back
Money off of Nastag, bumping, I'mma blast that
Ever since my last lap I've been on a fast track
Out to get this cash back, give me that, 20 racks
Hell out the module, mind state survival
Renegade revival, just a case of squabble
Happens in the module
Hip hop out in LA leaking
All the music on your block, I got tons of weed
Just in edibles
I'mma ride for my team
Just to let 'em know
Drench like hurricane, the purity that remains
In the veins of the assassins, just incredible
I heard it all, I'm not impressed
I don't pull a reefer, then I did so I left
Turn to temperament, icy cold conscience
Turn a knife, nigga, to a motherfucking monster
I got that poison to turn milk sour
Shady 45 on both sides pure power
This whole game is corrupted
There's nothing like corruption or rigged whack deduction
Just incredible, sour milk or nothing
LA leakers leaking all the heat out the oven in your ears
Lend me your ears
