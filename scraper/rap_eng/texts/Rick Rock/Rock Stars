[Hook]
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(Who is we?)
We're fucking rock stars
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(What is we?)
We're fucking rock stars

[Verse 1: E-40]
I wear many hats, I got hella shit on my plate
I got a tight as schedule, I wanna get sexual with this 8
Oster perpetual, 18 karat on my wrist
Everywhere I go I get patted down and frisked
I'm consistent with my script
My skrilla, my scratch, my dough
Corner boy rich, letting these suckers know
Got hella things to do, hella moves to bust, hella places to go
Got a lotta shit going on, looking for a warehouse to grow
My tree, legally, to sell to the weed stoppers
You see my folks got a garden in Mendocino
I used to live for the moment (what about now?)
But now I live for the future
Record company owner (what's your position?)
Chief executive producer, unit mover
Credit cards and checks (Who you on the phone with?)
On the phone with my realtor trying to buy a duplex
Heavy metal wheps, open up your chest
Armor piercing ammo, it'll go through the vest

[Hook]
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(Who is we?)
We're fucking rock stars
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(What is we?)
We're fucking rock stars

[Verse 2]
Generals, lieutenants and capos
Ghetto celebrities, buying NBA bottles
Hoes try to get pregnant by me, so they can hit the lotto
All I need was Me.I.P, in the mix like Serato
I don't want a model, I want some gutter puss
I don't like Mascato, give me some yurpple kush
My pimp partners think they slick me cracking me up all night
Stealing they hoes bitches so, thinking this pimp gonna bite
I don't need no Armorall I'm already polished
Y'all ain't seen what I saw, I got street knowledge
What is it bitch? There's game involved
When I was born I had to walk before I crawled
Went from pampers to drawers, briefs to boxers
The man of the house, growing up fatherless

[Hook]
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(Who is we?)
We're fucking rock stars
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(What is we?)
We're fucking rock stars

[Verse 3]
Rock star, everybody know me
Money and fame like David Bowie
Legend in the game, Thomas Dolby
Reminiscing names, Buddy Holly
Oh my golly, right now I'm drunk and sloppy
High like Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton me
Graduated from Rice University in 1990
What's the real definition of rice family?
Coca leaf, hover rock, cocaine
Booger sugar, yola-mayne
The game's the same, but the players change
Pimpin' talking them thangs, telling, and dropping names
Too much sucker shit, no enough real shit
Who the fuck is this tryna get in my bidness?
Hating 'cause I got bass in the trunk of my fucking car
Pluck it like a guitar, bitch I'm a rock star

[Hook]
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(Who is we?)
We're fucking rock stars
Dodge the boys in blue, they know who we are
Getting money off blow, driving fancy cars
Like everywhere we go we're buying out the bar
(What is we?)
We're fucking rock stars
