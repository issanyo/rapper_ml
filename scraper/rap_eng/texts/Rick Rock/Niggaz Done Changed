[Intro: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
Ah, me and my nigga 2Pac
Finna do what we do
Understand this
'Cause it's way understandable
Niggas done changed, man
You know they done changed, Rich, they done changed!
Check this out

[Verse 1: Richie Rich]
A tisket a tasket, my Calico made of plastic
And niggas don't make it home, when fuckin' with my dome
In my zone, niggas be gettin' pepper sprayed down
Trickin' with all them ballers done got that heifer laid down
And it hurts, but don't nothin' change, it's all the same
That's why I come real 'cause I'm so heavy off in this game
I been there, been taught that, niggas screamin' "Caught that!"
Standin' there with them niggas with a hand full of game and believe he bought that
'Cause here, the game is to be sold not told
Ain't no new jack nigga just finna jump in this ol' shit and ride out on gold
Unh-uh, naw, nigga gotta pay some dues
Nigga gotta feel some blues
See what it feel like to lose
200 bundles, 400 bundles, fuck it, a G
'Bout to cook shop, find out you really ain't got no D
You's imaginin' shit, and havin' money punk is real
Don't be the first to get checked
Nigga better retrospect

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
No more regular rappin'
Dare me to cap 'em and watch me blast
These niggas be actin' for that simple fact, playa I'ma mash
I lash on my enemies for multiple centuries
Forcin' my adversaries to bleed when they seein' me
Though East Coast born, I'm West Coast raised
Sent so much dick throughout the clique that now they Death Row slaves (Bow down)
Father forgive me for thug livin', I'm through with this drug dealin'
I leave it to Clinton and all the niggas that love prison
Brothas be ballin', Rich, if you need me, call
I'll open fire on muthafuckas and murder 'em all
Me Mr. Makaveli, plus I'm bustin' fuck what they tell me
I'm makin' these niggas hop on they toes like Alvin Ailey
I been shot and murdered, can't tell you how it happened word for word
But best believe that niggas gon' get what they deserve
In the same way, God bless my brain â€˜cause game pays
Gettin' cash and ass for days
Now niggas done changed

[Chorus: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
The game is to be sold not told
Still heavy in this game
Niggas done changed, it ain't the same
We been handlin' our business for years
Gettin' respect from all our peers
While most of our niggas incarcerated, doin' years
Bitches is tricky, niggas is snitchin'
While playas improve and move positions
Niggas done changed

[Verse 3: Richie Rich]
Call on my real nigga, when it's time to bring the heat
Suburban's swervin' hellsa deep down your street
Leave your trash down, 'cause it'll be clean when we sweep
Let's duff these niggas and hit they ass with some heat
Blow they chest up, 'cause they hatin' and segregatin'
Niggas crossin' lanes, it's time to blow your brains
Before I shot this nigga, I heard him scream "one love" (ONE LOVE!)
Fifteen in the clip, I only used one slug

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Hey! Now picture me rollin'
Piggie Smalls got his eyes swollen
My hands on my nuts, I gives a fuck, I'ma die holdin' 'em
Makin' these hoes pause while schemin' on those drawers
No money involved, condom, pussy, dick, and some alcohol
Picture me rollin' (what) horny hoes get they holes dug
I might show 'em thug passion but I'll never show 'em love
Can't hit me in combat, relentless when I ride
Strategize on my enemies and plottin' 'til they die
Ask me why I'm high, and my reply "'Til the day I die"
Don't wanna picture this cold world through sober eyes
Thugs don't die we multiply
Connect with the spirits of fallen homies and bustas, then we ride
Surprise niggas when they seen us, they duck down (Hahahaha)
Just as we anticipated, indo and bust rounds (buck buck)
Fuckin' clowns still watchin' clips of "I Get Around"
Scream like a bitch when I beat 'em down
Niggas done changed

[Chorus: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
The game is to be sold not told
Still heavy in this game
Niggas done changed, it ain't the same
We been handlin' our business for years
Gettin' respect from all our peers
While most of our niggas incarcerated, doin' years
Bitches is tricky, niggas is snitchin'
While playas improve and move positions
Niggas done changed

[Outro: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
And they still changin'
Understand what I'm sayin?
(Police switchin' up on niggas, judges done changed)
I don't understand that niggas done changed
Muthafuckas gettin' 60 years for some bullshit
Nigga, you know what I mean?
Niggas done changed
Ah, glad to have you back
That's right, big buddy
'Cause we ain't gon' never change
They may hold me for a second but these muthafuckas ain't gonna never hold me down, baby
Check this out
Thug life, baby
Fo' sho', me and 'Pac
Now we got muthafuckas in the house, fool
With the nigga Rick Rock
