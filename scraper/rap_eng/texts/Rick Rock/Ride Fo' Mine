(Chorus: Spice 1)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water

(Half-A-Mil)
I pack twin Glocks, sit mad Henrock, get cash in a Benz drop
Get ass till my dick drop, how much pussy can a bitch pop?
The way she makes that cash nigga thought she had a bounce in her ass
Hittin' the switches, gettin' the riches, million put on the bitches
Who wanna ride? Fuckin' with us is suicide
Spice 1 puffin' on blunts is light one, it's the right one
With tight funds from Brooklyn to Oakland
No chronic give the po' to smoke one
See we bad as hell, outta jail on bail
Feds put a tap on my cell, all I talk about is pussy and paper
In a hotel sippin' mo', gettin' the dough, 250 mill
Now we hittin' the door, come take plans raw
Leave without your hoes, without rolls, without your clothes, without your dough

(Chorus: Spice 1)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)

(Ike Dirty)
What the hell YOU cats thinkin'?
I ain't gonna bring it, smoke it, drink it, crack it, think it
Deep as Regans, fuck your feelings, don't wanna, can't get none
Grab your gun, slap your son, split a Half-A-Mil with Spice 1
Whoopin' any nigga like Tyson, sold the stamp
Ike Dirty hold it down, eyes everywhere, ears to the ground
Sold pounds, sold pounds they area, BK bit area
Air in your eyes, airin' you out
Steel in your mouth, what's this man about?
We ain't heard of me, next you wanna murder me
Check my styles as a matter of fact bring your gats
So when I come through I'm askin' where the cream is at
Seem is as puffin' like the meanest ass, squeeze off take cheese and dash
Your greasy ass, rap on niggas step on niggas
I'll be silent make y'all just check y'all (pause)...
Shut up man, (no doubt), shut up man, (haha)

(Chorus: Spice 1)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)

(Spice 1)
I'm a motherfuckin' killer for realer puttin' niggas up on they back
With the ass of a twin flex, smokin' a SACK!!
Thinkin' a nigga need to be in a motherfuckin' grave
I ain't the one that leave a nigga breathin' holes is laid
Up on the concrete face down with a h-h-hole in they back
Niggas a pound, sticky green then fuck 'em all
We ain't nothin' but real niggas livin' a ball
On call seven days a week, killer g's don't sleep
The niggas with the casket closed when we creep, creep
Pull a job, do it like the motherfuckin' mob
Throwin' niggas in trunks take 'em for a little ride
Hit the block with the fully automatic with static around the corner
Niggas bustin' at the hoodie goin' BLAOW!!
You bitches better throw in a towel, kill 'em off which is my style (MY STYLE!!, my style!!)
Situations occur when you front on my thuggin'
I'mma die fo' mine, cause your chrome up in the hummer, bail outta this drama
Get the fuck outta the scene, leavin' niggas with they mom where the fuckin' bell ding
Thug dreams, learnt from cream, wear my motherfuckin' life on a triple beam
But when the enemies see me I'mma dip in the cut
Pull out my Uzi and tear his motherfuckin' ass up

(Chorus: Spice 1)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!)
They wanna keep a nigga under the water
But I'm a killer I'mma DIE FO' MINE!!! (DIE FO' MINE!!)
But if a nigga try to front on my thuggin'
Then motherfucker I'mma RIDE FO' MINE!!! (RIDE FO' MINE!!) (*echoes*)
