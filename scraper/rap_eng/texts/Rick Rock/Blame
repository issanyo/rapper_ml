[Intro: Zac Wood AKA Bootz]
Yeah, what's goin' down, motherfuckers?
Watch Out Now: The Mixtape
Bootzilla Jenkins holdin' it down
With my young homie Tony Hardtimes
See, if you know about that 9-1-6
Sacramento history
You would know that this was our shit right here
'Zilla shit
What is it, Perk?

[Verse 1]
Ain't this a shame? The way my people fall in this game
We ride, steal, kill, smoke and leave the parents to blame
It ain't my momma fault, it all started off with the dice
I shook, rolled and snapped, took on the crap of my life
The dice landed on threes and had me reppin' the set
Puttin' my sevens on the scale and tryin' to push bad checks
My brother gave me the blueprints, exposin' the game
Lettin' off shots at our enemies over powdered cocaine
If momma knew what we was doin' she'd have blamed us both
It started off Blood gang, now we bang the coast
My right hand stay true and kept the pack on lock
The backbone of the crew, kept us all on top
Now look at me, the baby of my family ties
I'm six-three, but else I'm grown and ready to ride
It's just me, and ain't nobody else to blame
That's just America they always got a finger to aim

[Chorus]
Do you blame it on my momma 'cause she game me life?
Or is it all on my daddy for never raisin' me right?
Maybe my brother did it, keepin' me fitted with all this coke money
Maybe I was tired of havin' no money
Do you blame it on my momma 'cause she game me life?
Or is it all on my daddy for never raisin' me right?
Maybe my brother did it, keepin' me fitted with all this coke money
Maybe I was tired of havin' no money

[Verse 2]
Should I fight for the country you gone tell me is right
When they gone take me to jail if they come and catch me tonight?
Give me a pinstriped suit if I go kill a couple of dudes
But if these niggas shoot my bro then it ain't nothin' I can do
You gotta be sicker than me, and them niggas controllin' the planes
Skyscrapin' the population, transportation ain't the same
So I'm Southwest Federation, takin' a train
Ride 'Zilla for my niggas that I done lost in the game
Drain like powder, after thirty minutes of cleanin' your nose
Watchin' America point the blame at the people across the globe
R-I-P to New York, revenge is promised by the states
All they promised me was court, a hard bed and three plates
A cold block and more cops caught patrollin' the streets
Eighty percent of ten years if I get caught with this heat
I'd get my coke split, throat slit and thrown in The Bay
If I was caught without this pistol on a average day
'You need to stop sellin' cream' I know exactly what you mean
I never eat, I can't afford to sit and sleep on all my dreams
Even worse, the Devil done threw my relly over the bridge
Into the form of God's hands, Lord have mercy for your kids
Stuck between the walls of buildings that made history
I'm stuck between the rock and the dirt, and that's my history
Attacked and treated bad, suffocated by the misery
But here they take us prisoner, the system is what's killin' me
