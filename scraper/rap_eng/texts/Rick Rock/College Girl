Yeah, I just wanna thank you for
All the knowledge you've given me
And all that brain you gave me
In between your Math and English class, I love you

She's a bad dame, she doin' her thang
That girl right there got knowledge
Her mom and dad was happy as hell
When they sent that girl to college

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

She on MySpace, pretty face
I seen her when I post my bulletin
She was thick as hell, never went to Yale
Studied at Cal State Fullerton

Sac State, they go irate
The hoes just try to rush me
She said she new as hell, her face was pale
She cheerlead for Washington Husky's

Her name is Pam, she like to suck
To date a rap star is her dream
She go to Spelman, mixed breed
Player on the basketball team

I like 'em small, I like 'em tall
Bitch just get in my car
Educated, long hair second year UCR

She all wet, glistenin'
Fresh up out the shower
I'm in the dorm room, smokin' weed
When the campus all that hover

White girl, super blonde
Tryin' get her ass on me
I'm at the frat party feelin' myself
Damn, I love USC

She's a bad dame, she doin' her thang
That girl right there got knowledge
Her mom and dad was happy as hell
When they sent that girl to college

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

AUM in Atlanta is where I met this girl
She was light bright just like Whitney
From the show 'A Different World'

But she had a friend from NYU
That said she liked my group
She told me that she would get naked
And show me the chicken noodle soup

But I remember this batch from TU
When we went to Tuskegee
She was majoring in anatomy
Me and Charlene was so freaky

And WSU in Washington
I met this one cheerleader
She was flunking class but she thought me thangs
About how to please a young senorita

I'll never forget in Cancun
Where all the college girls go
I met a psych major from TSU
That gives counseling ways below

Now we in Chino with CSU
Pomona New Fair Project
This Puerto Rican girl, how she used her mouth
I swear damn she had great logic

She's a bad dame, she doin' her thang
That girl right there got knowledge
Her mom and dad was happy as hell
When they sent that girl to college

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

My college girl, super smart
Give head like she a genius
UNLV foreign exchange
Late night strip club, you'll see her

My staff abroad, oh my God
On the low in the 650
Solano College, community freak
She go, she's a part time hoe

Sac City, American ripper
Bay fig in the 916
Out in San Mateo, CSN
Yeah, her parents got chips, she rich

Across the bridge, USF
My freak from Saulsalito
She fine as wine [Incomprehensible]
[Incomprehensible] the dick like deebo

Cal Berkeley extra curricular
Oh man, they love your nigga
She's red ballin', big ass lips
Kinda look like Jigga's sister

334 Alabama
It's donkey in Montgomery
She's extra country, bow-legged
When school's out, she's in for me, yeah

She's a bad dame she doin' her thang
That girl right there got knowledge
Her mom and dad was happy as hell
When they sent that girl to college

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty

She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
She's a college girl, she's nasty
