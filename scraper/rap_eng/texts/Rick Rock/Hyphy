[Verse 1: Stresmatic]
I got my strap tucked in, vest tucked in
Clip tucked in, hyphy, and (Yeah)
Move like a smoker on bleem on the block (Wha)
And don't be mad if yo' homies got shot (Nuh-uh)
TJ, the nigga that you need in your life (Yeah)
I'm sick from the jaw, look at me on the mic (Rah)
Crazy, gas, break, dip on you hoes (Skrt)
And if you feel hyphy, go and smoke up your Vogues
Hanging out the sun roof blowing the dope
The homie got the chop up under the peacoat
Go crazy, stupid (Ayy), dumb, retarded (Uh)
Northern California gonna shoot up the party (Pow-pow)
Left coast, West Coast (Go), aim it at your chest coast (Go)
Ever since Pac died (Go), forgot about the West Coast (Go)
So my nigga, we feenin' for that (Ah)
40 Water (Uh), Federation (Uh), nigga (Uh) bringin' it back (Uh)

[Chorus: Stresmatic & E-40]
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy, make the nosy neighbors wanna call the cops
Hyphy (Hyphy), strikin' in them scrapers and them drop tops
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' crooked up and down the block
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' pulled over, won't stop
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), make a baby mama slap her baby daddy
Hyphy (Hyphy), dancin' all on the hood of your potna Caddy
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), get to goin' stupid, go, go, go
Hyphy  (Hyphy), we get to goin' dumb, go, go go
Hyphy

[Verse 2: E-40]
Now are we singin' from the same sheet of music?
I was taught to never pull a pistol on a hustler unless I was plannin' on using it
Soil savvy and quite compellin', hubba rock, turtle and cha-cha peddlin'
Got the business mind of a stockbroker and the mouthpiece of a car salesman
Me and my juniors be on the Sick Wid', figure eightin' and gettin hyph' (Hyph')
Hangin all out the window in them scrapers with whistlin' pipes (Whistlin' Pipes)
Gettin' our yaper on on can-orners shootin' dice (Shootin' dice)
Dollar danglin' (Uh) and fandanglin', shootin' kites (Shootin' kites)
Shoot me a letter back, take out time to write (Take out time to write)
I'll shoot you a letter back, you my dude for life (You my dude for life)
Surrounded by hustlas, hoodlums, and gangstas (Hoodlums and gangstas)
Harrassed by them sheriffs and park rangers (Park Rangers)
For drinking and smoking and perkin', gettin' blitzed (Gettin' blitzed)
For resistin' arrest with two cups up in my fists (In my fists)
Uh, they wanna put me to sleep, nighty-nighty (Nighty-nighty)
But I'm a fool about my shit, I'm too hyphy (I'm too hyphy)

[Chorus: Stresmatic & E-40]
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy, make the nosy neighbors wanna call the cops
Hyphy (Hyphy), strikin' in them scrapers and them drop tops
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' crooked up and down the block
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' pulled over, won't stop
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), make a baby mama slap her baby daddy
Hyphy (Hyphy), dancin' all on the hood of your potna Caddy
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), get to goin' stupid, go, go, go
Hyphy  (Hyphy), we get to goin' dumb, go, go go
Hyphy

[Verse 2: Doonie Baby & Stresmatic]
Stang with the Hi Pro motor
Put The Bay on MTV like Kurt Loder
Want the silver spoon like my name Ricky Schroder
Straight from Alabama, but a Northern Cal promotor
(Hy, hy, hy-hyphy) Hyphy, can't keep my body from tweakin'
Gurpin', Rossi and Henny what I'm slurpin'
40 Belafonte and Coon 'bout pimpin'
Big stake scrimpin', boss, no simpin'
Sleazy, butt-naked with your shoes on
Swisher in your mouth with a notch givin' dome
Grimy, out the scraper window sayin', "Whaa-"
On parole with a pistol, don't give a fuck
Turfin', when you keep your product in the bush
Your gun in the bush and your fetti in the bush
(Hy, hy, hy-hyphy) Hyphy, the same way The South get crunk
If it's funk, leave his body slumped, stank in the trunk
Hyphy

[Verse 4: Goldie Gold]
Piranha Pisces, smoke's how you heard of me (Uh)
Grown man gulpin' on a cup full of burgundy
Rossi, gig on your wig like The Mossie, watch me
Fo'-fo' under the clothes, ready to blap (Yee)
Water, you know your cuzzo bring stank like onions (Ooh)
Fresh cut, set a nigga up for his grunions
Step on bunions (Ahh), shoot holes dead in the pinky toe
If she man enough to swing, I'm bitch enough to fight back, so
We play the game how it's 'posed to be played
At the Grammys with a hundred turf niggas on stage
Who tear up The Source Awards? Bay cats do that
Vacuum money trees, after, won't pass your brew back (Nope)
Pac is in me, no it's not just the Remy
Good drugs got mama doc son in a frenzy
"You's a fiend" ("You's a fiend") So what? I bet your mama smoke rocks, too
Make a bucket feel like a Benz on the block, fool

[Chorus: Stresmatic & E-40]
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy, make the nosy neighbors wanna call the cops
Hyphy (Hyphy), strikin' in them scrapers and them drop tops
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' crooked up and down the block
Hyphy (Hyphy), gettin' pulled over, won't stop
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), make a baby mama slap her baby daddy
Hyphy (Hyphy), dancin' all on the hood of your potna Caddy
Hy, hy, hy-hyphy (Hyphy), get to goin' stupid, go, go, go
Hyphy  (Hyphy), we get to goin' dumb, go, go go
Hyphy
