[Verse 1-Doonie Baby]

Go ahead take a center, Satan's coming for dinner
In this world of living hell you can never be a winner
Now crooks with bad looks and tricks that got shook
You play with Doonie Baby and your life just got took
I'm living in the lines of money and fast cars
I'm used too being poor drinking wine from jelly jars
The storm
Loved by thugs and hookers alike
Faggots and dykes sweated by reverend knight
Nikies and Reeboks
More wet than droptops
Years for lifeline for nigga's who wanna shine
Aliz√© and Buddha
Bloods with six shooters
Hoes with fat clits and bitches with big hooters
With money movers freakin' with hella hoes
In the back of land cruisers
Niggas don't give a damn
Macaroni and candy yams curse the government
I got a bullet for Uncle Sam

[Hook]

Lord won't you please help me
Jesus
Take a sinner out me
Jesus
But if you feel you can't help me
Jesus
Just let my mind be free
Jesus

[Verse 2]

Now enemies envy just crawling like centipedes
Nuclear bombs which just made heaven bleed
Now if its all a game, why is the government shamed?
On computer based files now they know my name
Cos' ive been living in the ghetto of mind states that penetrate
Bodily functions
That have high class luncheons
I'm living in the lines of drugs and many lies
Used to being high so I won't have to cry
Super fly, loved by hookers and drug addicts
Fiends and dope heads getting sweated by city feds
Creepers and crawlers t
He biggest are baller's
Nicotine my ease pull, when those thugs annoy
Peace and gin, hella ho's with MAC-10's
Kids with switchblades and mamma's with hella sin
Killing for stupid trends
Making money stacking ends
And even money makers get jacked by family friends
This world is at the end
No hope for Resurrection
I'm sitting up in church with an UZI for protection


[Hook]

Lord won't you please help me
Jesus
Take a sinner out me
Jesus
But if you feel you can't help me
Jesus
Just let my mind be free
Jesus
