[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I'm a plastic surgeon, fix your face
I got Nascar numbers, I was built to race
Gon' be a long hot summer, Hubble 'scope from space
It's the next best thing since bakin' soda and base
It ain't the grill or the hunt, it ain't the paper we chasin'
All these bitches that you came to toot is basically basic
I'm gettin' white boy wasted, I'm wakin' up with a porn star
She walk around naked like she my personal OnStar
Push one button and boom: "Hey, baby, how can I serve you today?"
Pussy wet as a typhoon, ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate backstroke, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want, she get to makin' it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm 'bout to miss my flight
First class to London, fuckin' with you all night
But listen

[Chorus: Game]
Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships
Ridin' with models and spillin' Ace in the club
Showin' international girls how to throw up a dub
While my chain swing left to right
We came to party, we can do it all night
And my money never run out, we party 'til the sun out
We off Patrón shots, so you know we 'bout to dumb out

[Verse 2: RBX]
Wes, uncut, welcome him home
From BJ to YJ, now the G grown
One click of the wrist, the competitor gone
Flight patrol on your turf like the predator drone, whoa
Not to mention pit bull bully
Razor edge bloodline, Nutro fed fully
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for the fight
One flash, green lights mean run, hit on sight
Let's go to war now, rock the Luger steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
One finger slice, now you pay the price
Put your life on the line if you feel you're that nice
'Cause running bullshit over here'll get you shot
Stupid, I'm the truth, that's everything you not
X's mark the spot, that's everything that's hot
And walk right upon you and run everything you got

[Chorus: Game]
Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships
Ridin' with models and spillin' Ace in the club
Showin' international girls how to throw up a dub
While my chain swing left to right
We came to party, we can do it all night
And my money never run out, we party 'til the sun out
We off Patrón shots, so you know we 'bout to dumb out

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I-I hit 'em with a nuke 'cause they pussy and they scared to shoot
My niggas hit you with the 21-gun salute
I paratroop through your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I'm learned from the smartest
Treat a bitch like a bitch, treat a queen like a goddess
Accosted, bombarded, weighin' me down
Slide a razor through your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope by the boatload, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a choke-hold, deliver the rounds
I went from livin' with clowns to rockin' a crown
And protect myself, silence oppressed the sound
You was upper body violence, burn your jaw to the ground
Makin' how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Here and now make them dollars work, we smokin' that loud

[Chorus: Game]
Back up in this motherfucker, spendin' all my money in here
'Cause I don't care, blowin' kush in the air
Drivin' cars that look spaceships
Ridin' with models and spillin' Ace in the club
Showin' international girls how to throw up a dub
While my chain swing left to right
We came to party, we can do it all night
And my money never run out, we party 'til the sun out
We off Patrón shots, so you know we 'bout to dumb out

[Outro]
Dumb
Dumb
