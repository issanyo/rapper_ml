Walla walla walla bang bang (ehh-yeahhhh)
One me on the grand tree damn come from around kingsman (heh heh heh)
Walla walla walla bang bang walla dang dang dang (yea yea)
Walla walla walla bang bang what a dang thang (yea yea oh yea yea oh)

[Verse 1]
It's smoky up in here, so open up the vents
We heated up in here (With what?) with street instruments
My piranhas is hungry, we play for keep
We thick in this booch, we 60-something deep
We niggerish, booch, if you feel froggish, leap
Promiscuous, booch, sometimes we like to cheat
I'm spillin' my liquor, its all on my clothes
I'm smellin' like alcohol, 'bout to follow my nose
I'm mad doggin and thuggin, buckin and grudging
We off of them pills, and we ain't talking bout Bufferin
(Gold front and grills) like they do down south
(100 dollar bills) with furniture in they mouth
If you like it, I love it, when it's dry, it's a drought
If you dig it, I dug it, be about your paper route
If it's woofers, then sub it, clientele and clout
Party and clubbing, up in the building talking loud

[Hook: Rankin Scroo]
We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

[Verse 2]
(Yo) I'm having my yay-per, I'm feeling my scrill
I'm seeing my money, mayne, I'm a hustler for real
Gotta get it while its good, ain't no time to wait
It's dangerous in my hood but plenty money to make
I'm drinking a beer, I'm smoking a swisher
I barely can steer, I'm full of this liquor
I handles my biz, I'm taking my exit
The Carquinez Bridge, pimp, Magazine Street exit
I pull up my truck, I'm slapping my songs
Stop at the 7-11, talking shit on my phone
Hustler by nature (nature), gangster by choice
I'm checkin' my pager, I'm checkin' my voice-
Re-up and re-coppin', peddlin' and pushin'
More keys than a janitor, my nickname is Bookman
Bitches be lookin', old-folk be starin'
Pattin' me down, searchin' the clothes that I'm wearin'

[Hook: Rankin Scroo]
We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

[Verse 3]
(Yo) Mini fourteen, M-1 therapy
AR-15, pimpin', M-16s
Without me, won't be no slang in the game, it'll be extinct
I've been bamboozled and hoodwinked, mayne
People hit with all kind of these identity thieves
Underrated and hated on by all these squares in the industry
Mayne, I'm a legend, pimp, they call me E-Four-O
Ex D-boy used to push that blow
Gas, break, dip, stop, and go
Ride the strip, hit the sto'e
You know that I bought it, you know that I got it
Had to cop a bottle of the blue Hpnotiq
Incredible Hulks, you know what I mean
Mix it with some dark and watch that shit turn green
Higher than an elephant's eye, me and my guys
Off the broccoli and hash, actin a ass...

[Hook: Rankin Scroo]
We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

[Rankin Scroo]
Well allllright
Me a bad man, ruff by nature
You punkin' on me you goin' into danger
Me and the Don, ruff and down low ranger
Me thought me pot was comin' from Jamaica
No mess with stranger, no like imposta
Call me forecaster, we more like rasta
With the mix for ganja, I buy a lil cha cha
When they know inside, they blow sofa

[Hook: Rankin Scroo]
We gon' act a ass (push my Glock up in the grass)
We gon' do the fool (we'll be breaking all the rules)
So don't make me murdah (eh)
Emcees up in side (eh)
We gon' tap nigga and grind like that boy yeah
We gon' act a ass (aye-yeahhhh)

Walla walla walla bang bang walla dang dang dang (yea yea)
Walla walla walla bang bang what a dang dang thang (yea yea oh yea yea oh)
