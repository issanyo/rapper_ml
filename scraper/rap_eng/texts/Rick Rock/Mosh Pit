[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Oh my golly gosh, shit, I think I lost it
I be what they talking ’bout and why they gossip
This for them ghetto kids and them posh kids
I make ‘em turn their speakers up a couple notches
Them Jordan Spizikes on my feet looking spotless
I be on that heavy metal wave and that rock shit
Bitch I’m thirty thousand feet meet me in my cockpit
I be in the middle of a motherfuckin’ mosh pit
Living kinda lavish
Fashion week in Milan, fashion week in Paris
Everyday I’m fucking some one different on my mattress
I be one night standing I ain’t tryna be romantic
Yeah they call me Tinie but I’m bout to be gigantic
It’s a madness every single time I’m landing back in Stanstead
Did my thing up at the Brits and now I’m eyeing up the Grammys
The music got me moshing like I’m angry

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Mind over matter
You ain’t even on my level you don’t even matter
Mind over matter
You ain’t even on my level you don’t even matter

Where my fucking mosh pit?
Where my fucking mosh pit?
Where my fucking mosh pit?
Where my fucking mosh pit?

[Dizzee Rascal]
Oi watch how I handle this like ONG back
Pure elbows
Mind out mind out mind out

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal]
Rocking a roley, got my dick on your girlfriend's shoulder
And I’m far from sober, ain’t nobody controlling or holding me
I’m breaking the law breaking the law, see me in a mosh pit step to me
What are you waiting for? What are you hating for?
All I do is back beef, what do you cater for?
Worldwide jet setter, I’m gonna take a tour
You’re gonna date a whore
She’s gonna take you for a fifty fifty with that bullshit miss me
Got a pocket full of pounds and they’re extra crispy
Top boy in my town you can check the history
I’m a stone cold bredder and I’m extra misty
And I fight like a gypsy, flier than a six speed
Going somewhere fly where the chicks be
Keep a couple high bredders with me
Roll up the spliff, take a hit of this piff G quickly
Now I’m rolling stoned and I’m in my zone
I’m a east side bredder yeah that’s my home
Its the land of the hammers better watch your tone
You don’t wanna see me put a hammer in your dome
I’m Iron Maiden you breeders are fading
I’m running this game what the hell are you playing
What the hell are you saying
And my crew come through balls on parade
And you don’t wanna be brave, you just wanna behave
And all I wanna do is kick back in the Caymans
But I don’t mind killing you for entertainment
Nobody can save ya, call Jesus Christ or just change your life
You ain’t playing alright cos you ain’t the type
Don’t know why you wanna be up in the hype
When I’m in the mosh pit all day and night
Don’t chat to me if you ain’t ready to fight, alright?
