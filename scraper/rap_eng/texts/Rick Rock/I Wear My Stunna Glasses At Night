Chorus:
I Wear My Stunna Glasses At Night
So I Can So I Can Go ...
Scrap a whip (Car) with them whistlin' (exhaust) pipes
I Wear My Stunna Glasses At Night
So I Can So I Can Go
Open All Doors At The Stop Light
(Put Your Stunna Shades) (Put Your Stunna Shades On)

Christian Dior Frame Got The Lenses Out
Bend a Scraper Spin It Out
Got Clout Something Like A Boss Dude
Lookin Like Kool-Mo-Dee Cuzin I Coon (I Coon)
Dark 30 Gold On Premoo
Off To The Tree-man House (weed house) Gotta Reload
My Relies Really Can't Trust Us
Big *** Sunglass Got It From Bayview Bustas
Lookin Like A Bug Thizlummug
Lookin Like Im From Crest Woaa
Fresh No Mildew Tone-Loc Wit It
Suction Pipe On The Back Cause Smoke Wit It
My White-T Only Wear It One Time
Northern Cali Fall With The Sunshine
Yao Ming Some say (ya know what I mean) (yanowamean)
Dumb Hyphy Jumpin Full Circle

Gotta Pair make me Look Like Spiderman
Same Color as pepper called Cayan
At Night No Sun Don't Need A Tan
Old School Like A String On A Tin Can
Gotta Pair Like C-H-P Huh?
Thats Why They F*ck For Me Huh?
Thats Why They Hate On Me Huh?
Video Tape Sirvalence Me Huh?
Say Stunnas I Say Cool Ones
Half Naked In My Shades In My Blue Ones (Jeans)
Gotta Pair With The Studs Like Donna's
Light Green Lookin Just Like Limons (limes/lemons in spanish)
Sum Say Das My House Like Rond Rall
Doors Open On The Hood Of The Box Yeaa
Doing Cool Alabama To The Bay Mayne (Man)
Born In The City Where The River Flow Much Can-Coon

Me And The Trumplus In The Luck
Im So Flatland Like Table Park
Stunna Shades On And My Wrist Look Heavy
I Wear Em In The Dark Like Fab Five Freddy
Mettic Mettic Never Have A Job Again
Look So Cool Young Ray Robinson
Burned On Scrape Dooks Off Hazzard
My Homies Look Shady Like Marshall Mathers
We Smashin The Car Like A Rock Guitar
Mill Tj So Popular
Im Ridin with Joe On The Way To The Club
Big Stunna Shades With The Diamond Studs
Bay Boy They Boy Breakin And Dancin
All Out The Window Going Dummy U Bastards
Dudes with Dreadlocks swingin' their Head
U Ain't Got No Stunna Shades U Should Get U A Pair Yeaa

E40:
I Got My Rhine Stone Stunna Shade Glasses On
They Takin Picture With Me With They Lil Camera Fone
Headed To The Bar And They Playin My Song
WIth the Hennesy, f*ck Don Perion
The Broads Is Choosin
They Fightin & Shootin
Like 40 Water Say Pimpin We Tycoonin
We Sum Tymers We On Sum Real Time Bra Bra
Toon U Up If U Get Out Of Line Bra Bra
Northern Cali I Named It The Yay
The First Rapper I Seen With Stunnas Shades Was Mac Dre
Trend Settas
Hyphy Started In The O
The Hole Bay Go Stupid Im From The Valle-jo
And U Could Put This In The Hip Hop Bible
Keak Da Sneak first said "Hyphy"
Verse On His Album Is Sneakercidle
Nope It's (Hyphy) Not My Invention
But I'm Responsible For The Bay Game
And All Its Attention Ooo
