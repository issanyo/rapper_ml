[Hook: Kokane & E-40]
Automatic, systematic
Do what you do, playa
Just keep that money on ya mi-ind, (on ya mind)
In the traffic, Baller status, (baller status)
Do what you do, playa, (what you do)
Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)

[E-40]
Portable scales, checkin' my mail
Avoidin' the law, stayin' out of jail
Possession of sales, pocket all sales
Conspiracy charges, paper trails
Layin' the real, 'cause I don't write nothin' down
I keep it all in my head, intelligent
About my business, memory like an elephant
Chasin' a dream, schemin' for cream
Special weapons and tactics team
AR-15's and infrared beams
Pointed at domes, backs, and spleens
Fire hydrants, ambulance sirens
Suspended license, police indictments
Righteously what it all boils down to
Is basically who's the wisest
Ughhh, my heart made of granite
Slow down my spit so you squares can understand it
I didn't come in here empty-handed (empty-handed)
I came in here on business and y'all gone respect it dammit
Been out the game, did that mane
Vallejo I claim, made the name
Feel my pain, ghetto fame
Magazine Street hustla, mayne
Messin' around in the fast lane
Chevy, Cougars, and Mustangs
Novas, Granadas, and Falcons
Project livin' in public housin'

Just keep on hustlin' on the gri-i-ind, (on the grind)

Ladies and gentlemen...
It's Ghetto F-A-Beezy F-A-Sheezy
Bustas hate me 'cause I F'd they breezies
Playboy, these TECs spray easy
Like you don't know the hoodrat Hugh Hef play greasy
I get money on the grind
So if got ya mind on my money, I put some money on ya mind
Ya honey gone be mine 'cause ya diamond forecast
Is partly cloudy; the kids look sunny on the shine
I'm gettin' ticked off again; y'all must like ridin'
In long black Caddies that they stick coffins in
The clique often been blowin' sticky
That come in the jars that they stick coffee in
I got chicks offerin' but I play hard to get
Unless they suck me 'til my dick soft again
You lookin' at the way, the coast to coast G
Do it from the Brooklyn to the Bay
Bring the hook in by the way, oh

It don't matter if you locin' or bleedin'
Whether it's Backwoods or Zig Zags you're smokin' your weed in
You slow pokin' or speedin'
All that counts to these motherfuckers is if you broke or succeedin
I'm gettin used to strokin' and sweetin', pokin' and skeetin'
Stayin focused while feedin', so I don't choke what I'm eatin'
I'm lookin' for towns to put the coke and the weed in
To sit with white folks in a meetin', please believe it

(Badabababa ba badababa bang bang)
I used to sell tapes up out my trunk and slang 'caine (boom)
Respected on the streets before the fame (boom)
Ain't nothin' lame or game goofy about my game (boom)
Paid my dues, obeyed the rules
Stuck to the script, me and The Click
All of my fellas and all of my dogs
Ridin' on mustard and mayonnaise on Vogues
Fillin' em up, sittin' em down
Flossin' and bossin' all over the town
Hardest eight measures you ever heard in your life
Man, write that down (write that down)
