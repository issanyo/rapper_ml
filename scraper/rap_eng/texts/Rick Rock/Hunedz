[Hook: Rick Rock]
Yeah, my nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)

[Verse 1: E-40]
No periods, all commas
No ones in my stacks, these "hunedz"
I can give it to ya if you want it
Nigga if you got it then flaunt it
I started with a teaspoon
Now I'm a tycoon
Keep it lit like a full moon
Street sweeper [?]
I started with nothing, all of a sudden I'm something
My jewelry be bustin', showcasin', flossin' and stuntin'
My woofers be subbin', I know they know that I'm comin'
You might want to hide her or glue your hand to your woman
My big ol' G's be shinin',  [?]
My lil niggas be grindin', and they be shootin' and fightin'
I tell 'em stop all the violence, mama's at funerals cryin'
The P's be poppin' and the mackin' be multiplyin'

[Hook: Rick Rock]
Yeah, my nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)

[Verse 2: E-40]
(Makin' all kinds of paper in my sleep)
Gotta stay with your stapler, play for keep
Don't wanna be seven days, I can't be week/weak
Never know who out there plottin' tryna sneak
I be blowin' purple haze up out my Jeep
My air bitches are soiled like a cleek
I be perkin' off that loyal when I drink
You don't want no problems, want no beef
Your ratchets like some foil like some meat
I'm talkin' sign language, I can't speak
When I get questioned by police
Threw off methods to make 'em think that I'm a geek
Activated, I might put your bitch to sleep
The homie just touched down, forgot to mention
Told me look at niggas hands and pay attention
Be about your rubber bands and your funds
I don't make it rain 'cause I ain't got no ones

[Hook: Rick Rock]
Yeah, my nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)

[Verse 3: E-40]
Of course, I'ma keep it lit like the fourth
I could talk your mom out her purse
Without no harm, or no force
When I was starvin' like Marvin and eatin' noodles and spam
Some bread or some milk or some peanut butter and jam
The way I was built from the gravel, the soil, the land
You can get killed if you out here cattin' and playin'
I'm fried, I'm burnt, I'm on 10, I stay turnt
Suckers tryna monitor the money I earn
I got the gift of the gab, could talk a rock off a cliff
[?] pill scraps, throwin' 100s to Crips
Blue bags, well deserved
C-notes, like Charlie Bird
My player partners straight up out the rich
Known for goin' hard on a bitch

[Hook: Rick Rock]
Yeah, my nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
(These is hunedz, these is hunedz, these is hunedz)
My nigga, these ain't ones
