[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Real cocky, real sloppy
Drunk at the club and y'all can't stop me
Superstar style, woop to our pals
Out the roof, I scoop the group we troop in large crowds
Yes we are foul and we rich now
Used to be all on me, but it's all on a bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, and come into my world
It's too late I got
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)
I was nineteen, met a nice queen
Car was bright green, naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous Nickolas, sort of ridiculous
With the lip kickin' it
We can never be inconspicuous
(My bitch) Rolls with me, it's so sickly
In love with me, but she give me fellatio hickeys
Would go get me, in the wee hours to get me slow quickies
So sticky, roll with my homies, she so shifty
(My wife) Married a monster, carried a youngster
Said if you cheated would come back to haunt ya
She say my filthy world makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Daddy told me this, "You wanna control the chick
Ya gotta go blow her grip, 'cause it's all on a bitch"
One is no trip and two is just mo' lip
But three I can cope with
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)
Daddy told me this, "You wanna control the chick
Ya gotta go blow her grip, 'cause it's all on a bitch"
One is no trip and two is just mo' lip
But three I can cope with
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Got a nice anus, and it's ripe, ain't it?
Can't really touch it durin' the day, but in the night taint it
Usin' fight language when she take inches
Great bitches, gettin' busy on the weight benches
(My bitch) Got a big butt, a big slut, who get bucks
You might luck up and get your chick sucked
'Cause she's bi-sex, keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gon' try next
(My wife) Got a ghetto booty like Naomi
I'ma tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wear Apple Bottom jeans
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)

(My wife, my bitch, my girl)

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
If one's trippin' the other's for fun, pimpin' you cool
She run's limpin' you end up with funds missin', you fool
Come wicked, your woman becomes vicious and cruel
Dumb trick gets ya fumblin' some chicks and you lose
I done balanced the playalistical values in life
I done challenged the way of mystical powers and hype
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch, and my wife
Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it 'cause Nina macks the three
Have to be, crass to see
If not you'll cause a catastrophe, exact-aly
(My wife) Don't like me
(My bitch) Gets hyphy
(My girl) Might knife me twice just to spite me
(My wife) If I break her heart
(My bitch) It'll rip her apart
(My girl) But I'm the smarter y'all
(My wife, my bitch, my girl)
