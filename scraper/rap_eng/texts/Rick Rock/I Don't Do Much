[Verse 1 Michael Barber]

Loungin' with the hippies getting tipsy y'all shitty
Pain pills, brain chill, way off the main reel
Nice breeze, white T, looking for wifey
Well, not really a wife just to get silly tonight
Really I be on about 30 milly and right
I spit a little riddle about the ritalin and bars
Came from the middle now Florida living large
Y'all be on that hard shit, not moving lethargic
Slow as a barge ship, I'm making cards flip
Getting money on my Nicky Barnes tip
Sunshine, primetime, every time the kid rhyme
I don't do a thing, might F the world up
Find me in the club gripping on a girls butt
You know your boy trying to get a squirrels lunch
Not worried about the boys, they out patrolling
Beach side, watching the waves roll in

[Hook]

Smoke liquor, drink weed
I don't do much

Get head, write rhymes
I don't do much

Roll around, Kill time
I don't do much

Off on the next level
I don't do much

I don't do much
Naw, I don't do much

[Verse 2 Matty Moe]
I don't do much but sit back and write rhymes
Like a victim of civil court, I'm about mine
Don't do much but sip liquor and smoke weed
Worry about you let me worry about me
Don't do much but push my music to get right
Little inspiration about to take flight
Don't do much but this music right heres my life
My roots to this shit cut deeper than a knife
Sitting in the sand drift away in the ocean breeze
Not much more I need than a blunt of weed
Don't do much but still buzzin' like a bee
Don't do much but yet everybody notice me
Money, cash, hoes, really just about the cheese
When it come to the boss you can't better me
Coming hard every time I'm the one in charge
Army salute you can call me sarge

[Hook]

Smoke liquor, drink weed
I don't do much

Get head, write rhymes
I don't do much

Roll around, Kill time
I don't do much

Off on the next level
I don't do much

I don't do much
Naw, I don't do much
