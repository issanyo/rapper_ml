[Hook One: Xzibit over 4X of "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"]
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate
Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate, concentrate

{"Nam Myoho Renge Kyo" continues to repeat in the background}

[Xzibit]
Meditate, levitate
Greetings from the Golden State
Mr. X, to the Z
Concentrate, come walk with me
Your shit sound so awkwardly
I don't rhyme I just stomp down beats
Real estate, section eight
Which one would you rather take?
Concentrate, move that weight
Show me how you regulate
Hold up, wait, that shit's fake
Get these niggas up out my face
Shake the room, bend the spoon
Turn this up now, stay in tune
Hypnotized by the way she move
Take your time you might arrive too soon

[Hook One]

[Hook Two: Xzibit over 4X of "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"]
Bring that back, what was that?
Oh my lord, she got back
So precise, so deattached
Oh my God, who is that?

[Xzibit]
Hibernate, consummate
Man was made to procreate
My estate, generates
As if my family name was Gates
Days of grace, lift big plates
Why be good nigga, go be great
Hit the breaks, crack them crates
Have you on the run goin state to state
Contemplate, demonstrate
Mind over mayhem, no mistakes
Lift some weights, eat some steaks
But you don't really want that face to face
But let's relax, check your traps
Don't let yo' concentration snap
I love the way she arch her back
Like how a muh'fucker 'sposed to handle that?

[Hook One] + [Hook Two]

[Xzibit]
Breath control, touch yo' soul
Just maintain don't lose control
Participate, congratulate
Cause everything else'll be seen as hate
Remain in place, the same mindstate
Get off yo' ass and celebrate
Congregate, associate
Don't fuck yo'self procrastinate
Dilate, to an all time great
Calculate the next move I make
Crack the safe, keep that ace
In my waistband just in case
I'm no rat can't run yo' race
Not too good don't fit my taste
I love the way she make that shake
Makin it hard to concentrate

[Hook Two] + [Hook One]
