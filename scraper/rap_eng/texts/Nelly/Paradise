[Hook]
She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be
Cause she's
The finest women that I've ever did seen
And not to mention how she looked in them jeans
She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be
Cause she was
The definition of a ghetto queen
And you should see that apple bottom in jeans

[Verse 1]
I met her on a Sunday
One day she walkin down the runway
5'5", so fine
What the fuck I'm 'gon say
And I just sit there patiently
Just wait and observe
Waitin for my perfect chance so I can spit out my words
I think she openly scopin me
Damn I hope she notice me
Hopefully she'd go for me
If so she on the boat wit me
And I'mma take her places she can never imagine
Like waterskiin in Costa Rica
Snowmobilin in Aspen
Does she prefer the cold of winter snow
Or do she like it tropical
Am I dreamin, let me know
You tell me is it possible
That I could be the one to end her search for a man
And she could be my one to end my search for woman
No time to slack now
Act now
Ooh I'm about to crack now
I put my rap down, mack down
Ain't no turnin back now
I got this feelin that she feelin the same
About to end these feelin games
And just ask her her name

[Hook]
She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be

That's what she said it would be
Cause she was
The definition of a ghetto queen

[Verse 2]
So the next day, on Monday
I'm ridin down the freeway
Hit her on her 2Way
I'm like watchu doin Tuesday
She said that she be free anytime after three
And every second after that'll be reserved for me
I said that's good to know
This ain't no mo'
"I'll be there around four"
Around fo' that fo' do'
Phantom at your front door
We can take it for a ride
Kick it and conversate
Debate or disfate
Diner reservations at eight
And after diner
Champagne
Walks along the beaches
While that
Moonlight
Shines and your features
And I can't create the words
To explain my sudden nerves
The temptation to feel your body
Temptation to kiss the curves
Started one kiss
Two kiss
She all on my neck and I
Gimme that three kiss
Four kiss
I'm all on her neck
Now the, temperatures rise
And them hips and thighs
Got me hipnotized
Man I don't wanna stop

[Hook]
It feels like Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be
Cause she's
The finest women that I've ever did seen
And not to mention how she looked in them jeans
She said her name was Paradise
That's what she said to me
She said Paradise
That's what she said it would be
Cause she was
The definition of a ghetto queen
And you should see that apple bottom in jeans

[Bridge]
They don't understand me cuz
I really don't understand it myself
I can't live without
My girl
Paradise is mine mayne
Anywhere or time mayne
She 'gon hold it down cuz she
My girl
She love me she love me not
She love me to be on top
She love daddy despite because she
My girl
And if you got any doubts
Just ask when you see me out
I'll tell you who I'm talkin about
My girl
