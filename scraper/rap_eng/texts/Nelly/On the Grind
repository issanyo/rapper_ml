[Introduction]
Uh, yeah, swing, Nel, my dirty Jacob, yeah, come on

[Hook]
Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll
If you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
Were you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride
Get inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth
Then, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me, were you the one that's on the grind
Check it, was it you that was on the grind dirty

[Verse 1: Nelly]
They acting like they really want it with me, trust me
They don't really want it, they just want to be seen
They want to disrupt my team with these publicity schemes
Trying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals
But uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war
I tell you the situation like I've been here before
I'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking
Watching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting
No choking or bleeding, this ride is for free, no matter what
You got your dying for free, automatically
I'm focused like thirty five millimetres, all of the sudden
Like such and such wants to meet us, all of the sudden
Like such and such wants to greet us, the same, will you believe us
Now, they're all trying to cheat us, in real life, they can't beat us
Sometimes, they try to repeat us

[Hook]
Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll
If you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
Were you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride
Get inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth
Then, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me, were you the one that's on the grind
Check it, was it you that was on the grind dirty

[Verse 2: King Jacob]
Why is they yacking like they fucking with these, I don't know
Why is they stunting like they holding the keys, tell me
Them type of people don't be holding no heat, no
Then how the fuck they gon' be rolling with me, yeah
Dude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time
Your mouth's going to fuck around and going to waste your time, hey
I told them niggas' that ain't going to grind
When its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty
I'm the same nigga that's out of control, out of control
I put a little malinger out on the roll, hey, the bigger it just got
The calico, I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah
Set that aside cause I've got to get those, got to get those
The finest shit than what you're proud of me for, tell me
The dirty, either you going to ride or you don't, yeah
Inside there's more shit, if not, we're gone, nigga

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you tell them, watch me now, I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now, you tell them
Watch me now, I'm spiffy now
Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Well, if I said it, I've done it, if I've done it, I did it
And if I, and if I want it, if I don't put it against it
The way that I should spend it to get just how I should
All money ain't good money but no money ain't good
I took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents
Trying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas
Never matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know
I'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor
I'm dotting, just want to be, I ask, clipping the wings
I want to fly ass, only Q and D Miles can look down on me
Maybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie

[Hook x2]
Now if you're going to ride, get inside, lets roll
If you're running your mouth, then, shit, then shut my door
I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
Were you the one that's on the grind, if you're going to ride
Get inside, lets roll, if you're running your mouth
Then, shit, then shut my door, I ain't got nothing on my hands but time
Tell me, were you the one that's on the grind
Check it, was it you that was on the grind dirty

[Bridge]

Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now
