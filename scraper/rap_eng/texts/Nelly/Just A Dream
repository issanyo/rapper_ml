I was thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me
Thinkin' about us, what we going be?
Open my eyes, yeah; it was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
When you coming back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
I was at the top and I was like I'm at the basement
Number one spot and 'till you found a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
It's hard to leave the ground with those broken wings
Cuz I can still feel it in the air
I'm falling hard for you and I'm getting scared
My lover, my life. So sorry, goodbye
He left me, I'm tied
Cuz I knew that it just ain't right
I was thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me
Thinkin' about us, what we going be?
Open my eyes, yeah; it was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
When you coming back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
When I ridin' I swear I see his face in every turn
The spark is gone but it still burns
And I just hope he knows he's the only one I yearn for
Oh, I miss him when will I learn?
Didn't give him all my love, I guess now I got my playback
Now I'm all alone thinkin all about my baby
Hey, he was so easy to love. But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin through it every time that I'm alone
And now i'm missin, wishin he'd pick up the phone
But he made a decision that he wanted to move one
Cause I was wrong
And I was thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me
Thinkin' about us, what we going be?
Open my eyes, yeah; it was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
When you coming back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wish you could give them everything
I said, if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wish you could give them everything
I was thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me
Thinkin' about us, what we going be?
Open my eyes, yeah; it was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
When you coming back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
I was thinkin' about you, thinkin' about me
Thinkin' about us, what we going be?
Open my eyes, yeah; it was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
When you coming back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream
