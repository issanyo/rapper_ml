Music high, lights low, cup full, smoke go
Yeah I'm leanin, but I ain't feel yet
I heard the people's watching, but I ain't went to jail yet
I'm tryina get it like I never did, call the auction, place a hunned million dollar bid
Bill gates and Donald trump now who a nigga is
I don't knock no more, they just let a nigga in
My gps set to that promise land, stay focused I promise man
Look back, I ain't promised and I got a master plan, that's a plan to win
Hater then, they gonn hate again, problem with me, better say it then
If not, then shut the f*ck up

Too much on my mind, ain't got too much time
Won't catch me going broke, specially for on hoe
Street shit all I know, can't put trust in no bitch
Westing it's pimp c, I miss that ugk shit
I might not usually say shit, I mind my own bindess
Got my own money, f*ck my own bitches
Feed my own stomach, take care my own children
Long as I keep hustling, in this
Can't keep my hands clean, still got my dirty ways
My head f*ck that thang so much about my dirty days
I'm at a certain age, where I can't make mistakes
Can't end up locked up in no cage, where ain't no escape
I gotta find a plan, I gotta find a way, I'm just contemplating
