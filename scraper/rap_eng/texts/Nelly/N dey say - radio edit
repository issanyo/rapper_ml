Ohhhhhh oh ohhhh
Hold up, stop now, let me get a look 'cha
Damn girl i ain't seen u since prom
Come to think about it can't believe it's been that long
I heard your man locked down now
How long he gone? oh, dat long
How the hell he get time like that
3 strikes for possesion aww he ain't coming back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick cross town
It's always the darkest right before the sun rises
And you gotta stay strong for the kids in they eyes'n
Please dont despise and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound 2pac-ish li'l mama keep your head up
But your gonna make it i promise you keep your head up
And that that dont kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed only feed the hunger
Fo' reel (fo' reel, fo' reel)

I was at the gas station when a man walked past
With a sign...'will work for food, clothes or cash'
And he asked if he could pump my gas so i let him
Clean the windsheild and throw out the trash so i let him
Hey, i even asked a brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they ages
He kinda stuttered for a second, he kinda looked suprised
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, "young brother them the only words i've heard in the last year
Wasn't no or get the f*** away from herrrr"
How could something so simple as general conversation
Mean much more than general conversation
Hey you could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in the title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone then realized we even had it
Fo' real (fo' real, fo' real)
(ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Yeah, hey
Ohhhhh

I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until i realized life had to be planned by me
See that's the key i only deal wit what i can see
Cuz over history, mystery brought us nothin but misery
Man more people done died in the name of the Lord
Then in any natural disaster, disease or gang wars
Before guns they was swords and they was killin each other
And what's changed to this day still killin each other
Killin a brother while another mother cries for help
Man, we need to help a brother find himself
Feed 'em light 1, 2, 3
Hey that's somethin every brother should see
And thats fo' real
And thats fo' real
And thats fo' real
(ha-haha-ha-ha)
