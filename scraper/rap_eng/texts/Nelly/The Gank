[Intro: talking in the background]

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Come on
Wooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy

I never felt this way before
And she's all that I need and more
Her hips and waist belongs to me
It often makes me write on my dreams
If I knew there was only nine
She's still might be around because

[Chorus]
I (I) can't go on
Oh no
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without her
My life just won't (it won't) be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without
Woooooooooo

Shit Lord have mercy

[Verse 2: Nelly]
I Never thought that i would be
So caught up i wouldn't see
Just who would go to war for me
And take out two or three so easily
I give up everything to see if I found you (baby girl)
Cause it don't mean shit without you cause

[Chorus w/ talking in the background]
I (I) can't go on
Oh no
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without Her (without)
My life just won't (it won't) be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without
Woooooooooo

Shit Lord have Mercy

[Verse 3: Nelly]
I gave her everything she ever needed
That why it shocked me when she said she was leavin
I wanted to find out what was going on cause
I'm thinkin to myself man something wrong
And then smokin one day it hit me kinda fast
That I needed to check my stash

{*talking in the background*}

Cause I

[Chorus]
I (I) can't go on
Oh no
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without her (without her)
My life just won't (it won't) be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without
Cause I
I (I) can't go on
Oh no
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
Without her (without her)
My life just won't (it won't) be the same
I tell you what am I gonna do now (Hey)
