[Nelly]
Have a drink (have a drink) let's get it in (let's get it in)
Where your girls at? (Girls) Call your friends (call your friends)
Let the top back and we can take a spin
Roll it up and we can blow it in the wind
What you need? (What you need?) We'll hit the mall (we'll hit the mall)
Tell your man you gon' holla at him tomorrow
And later on I'ma show you how to ball
But tonight shorty we gon' do it all, so

[Interlude: Rico Love]
What you waitin on? I'ma come and get you
Girl just hit me when you're leavin the club
Don't put them panties on, girl you ain't gon' need 'em
Cause I promise I'll be tearin it up

[Chorus: Rico Love]
Cause we don't make love, we be makin movies
We don't make love, we be makin movies
Girl this ain't a tub, we in the jacuzzi
Watchin all the suds run down on your booty
We don't make love, we be makin movies
We don't make love, we be makin movies
Girl this ain't a tub, we in the jacuzzi
Watchin all the suds run down on your booty
Turn the lights on

[Nelly]
Back it up, bend over, put it on me girl then drop
Go for what you know cause I love it when you on top
It's excitin when you bitin, you fightin to get that spot
You can get that guap, as long as you don't stop
On your back with your legs up
All up in the air, just keep 'em right there
You won't find nothin better
You're dealin with a player, the man right chea girl

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[Nelly]
I don't care, let 'em stare, they gon' be the audience
We gon' be the superstars, we'll perform for all of them
You gon' scream my name and I'll put your name in the lights
I'ma change your life, stay with me tonight
Ohhhhhh

[Chorus] - repeat 2X
