[Intro: Pitbull]
My girl is the kind of girl that walks in this world, (Mr. Worldwide)
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool. (Nelly)
My girl is what these other girls wanna be
But that's what she's with me, my kinda girl!

[Chorus: Nelly]
You're like my kinda girl
She walk like my kinda girl
She talk like my kinda girl
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line, get in line
Yeah! cause every nigga in here want you!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You name it, she's got it, cheating realistic about it
Disrespecting, acting fool in public, I doubt it!
If there's skeleton is in the closet
That's where she keeps it
I do business with sharks
So she stays quiet and peeps 'em
Even if she's playing with time
Sequence, she keeps 'em
Never goes through what's mine
She respects the grind
I respect her mind
That's why I made her mine
For me she'll fight the world
And that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision!
That's food for thought
Now let 'em haters do the dishes!
A pair of tall heels and her stockings fishnets
And ain't talking fishing
She's got a six sense
Green paper with that [?]
Nah, don't impress her
She'll break a full court
So watch how you press her!
She came some nothing 'till she know some
Yeah, that's true!
For me she'll fight the world
And that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1: Pitbull & Nelly]
My girl is the kinda girl that walks in the room
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool
My girl is what these others girls wanna be
But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl!

[Bridge 2: Nelly]
Sometimes she's bourge, sometimes she's hood
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!
And when she's with me, she know she's good
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!

[Chorus]
