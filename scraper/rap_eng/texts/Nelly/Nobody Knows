[Anthony Hamilton]
IIIIIIIII didn't know, there'd be troubles along the way
Nobody told me nothin, nobody told me nothin, nothin
Well, well, ohh, ohhhh, ohhhhhh, oahh-ohhhh
Well, ay-heyyy, ay-hey, we-ell
Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh-huh

[Nelly]
I went through, 8 different schools in, 12 different years
That's 30 different teachers, over ten thousand different peers
And I done fought in e'ryone, been suspended e'rytime
Besides a few a felony, done committed e'ry crime
But never braggin on, just want you to see me what I done done
I'm never proud of it, so I don't have to go back there again
And uhh, I used to go like house to house (man)
Sleepin on couch to couch (you know)
Walk around stickin out my hands, lookin for a handout
Only thing I handed out was more bills
Only thing pulled me out was my will
God told me the sun don't chill
Determined to make use of one of these skills
Either that or go beat the block
Ain't no way you can beat the cops
Ain't no way I can beat the clock
Just a matter of time shut down your shop
Ohh, you stay up day and nights, livin this way of life
I was Young and Restless
All My Children came and then I had a Guiding Light (hey)
No more of that sittin mayne (c'mon) sittin and waitin
And thinkin somebody comin to take me up off them streets
But now I know..

[Chorus - Anthony Hamilton]
Nobody told me that the road would be easy, yeah
I don't believe, I've made it this far
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know
Nobody told me that the road would be easy (Whoaaaaaa, that the road)
I can't believe, I've made it this far (Whoo, yeahhh)
My whole life, man I've been workin so hard and I know

[Nelly]
I can tell you right now, I'm sayin
I could sit here and count on one hand
How many people seen me graduate
I know a few that did but a bunch that ain't (hey)
Same folks showin up in swarms, waitin for me to go on
Wantin to see Ali perform, wasn't so po' before
I became this household name
I was playin them Little League games
Nobody curred if I go 0-for-3
Nobody out hurr rootin for me but my Momma
Supported me in e'rything, "Why she get e'rything?"
Some people got the nerve to ask
Y'all can kiss my ass, and that's my Momma
Got a sister that need my help (hey) and I gave peace all with wealth
Give anything that I have, just to see her in perfect health
Now we out hurr complainin, "I got work to do" (ohh)
How bad you think you got it, somebody else got it worse than you (hey)
I done had them down and ups and, don't plan on comin back down (no)
Don't plan on leavin hurr no time soon, but I got too comfortable now
Wouldn't have no knowledge of wealth, without no knowledge of self
And I'ma keep walkin this road - my mind, body and soul
I know {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[Anthony Hamilton]
I didn't knowwwww
There'd be troubles along the way (I didn't know there'd be troubles)
Nobody told me nothin (nobody told me nothin)
That would help me to ease my pain (to help ease my pain, yeah)
I've been walkin this roooooad, for forever and a day (forever and a day)
Now I've been searchin somethin (whoa-ohhh)
For someone to help me find my way (somebody help me, find my way)
And now I know

[Chorus] - fades out w/ ad libs
