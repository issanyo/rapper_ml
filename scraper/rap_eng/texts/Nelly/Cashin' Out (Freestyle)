[Hook]
I'm on Natural Bridge, coming down down with that Nina (With that Nina)
In a drop top, lambo in my wife beater (in my wife beater)
I got a bad bitch named Keisha rolling that Keisha (Rolling That Keisha)
And later on I got a few things I'm gon teach her (I'm gon teach her)
Got a mansion round my wrist girl, and I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got a V-12 in my whip mane and I'm mashin out (I'm mashing out)
Got her legs wrapped round my waist mane, I'm smashin' out (I'm smashin' out)
Put 'em up around my neck girl, and I'm eatin' out (I'm eatin out.)

[Verse 1]
Yea, It's on (It's on)
Tell me what you want (What you want)
It's yo choice baby just tell me what you want (What you want)
Don't worry bout it cause everybody in here grown (in here grown)
We turned up, turned Up-Up-Up like yo phone (Sheesh!)
Shorty got a body so bad make a nigga say (Sheesh!)
I got a fully automatic when I cap, make a nigga say (Sheesh!)
St. Louis, all the weight that im makin'
I got fat niggas talkin', slim niggas hatin'
Wanna be The Man, but I'm sorry that's taken BOY
