[Intro: Sean P]
(P-I) Yeah, ay, whassup c-c-cuz?
It's goin down, Eastside, yeah
Ya boy Sean P, Nelly, Pimp C, ay

[Pimp C]
My paint too wet bitch, never pay my set bitch
Blue and red make green, just cash the check bitch
Went to the car lot, bought me a Vanquish
Never trick my money in the club with a skank bitch
Big shrimp on my plate, look like dolphins (dolphins)
Pushin cookies in the soft ones
I can do better by myself, not bad (bad)
Girl ate the whole thing if she call me Chad (Chad)
The records ain't sellin up there, they mad (mad)
Rappin like us gotta hit but you a fag
I'm a young country nigga, uncut like snow (snow)
Make them young girls get down on the flo' (flo')
Make them young niggas put candy on the 'Llac
You got clouds in them diamonds, take that monkey shit back
Cause I'm smokin out, throwin up, keep that lean off in my cup
Smokin out, throwin up, keep that heat off in our truck

[Hook: Nelly, Pimp C, Sean P]
When I hit the parkin lot, and the fifth wheel drop
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm fresh from the jeweler and it's sunny outside
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
When I'm creased up, J'd up, E's and my K's up
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me, all eyes on me!)
From all them niggas that's trill to them niggas unreal
You know damn well (you don't wanna see me) uh-uh
So quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)
Quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (look here)
Quit it mayne (lil' boy) cut it out (now go 'head)
Now watch my fingers (lil' boy) cut it out (hold up!)

[Nelly]
I ain't choose yo' chick, yo' chick chose me
I ain't gotta pick one, I'mma take all these
For every hundred you got, I'mma peel off three
Hey, don't worry 'bout it lil' boy, that bill on me
Eight years now, you can call me a vet
That money you grossin, call that a fourth of my neck
We don't call paint shiny, we call paint wet
A Darryl Strawberry colored Coupe, call that a Met
Got a few rides already, got a few more to cop
Got a blue one that's hard, got a black one that dropped
Got a Buick that's green, the same color my snot
Lil' daddy you ain't the shit, you might as well get off the pot
That's some new St. Louis shit, yeah that's funny
But I'mma stick with the old, the new don't make enough money
So when I'm on (wipe me down) when they dirty (wipe 'em down)
You think I showed my ass befo', sit front row (and watch me now)
Cause my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it
Said my grandmomma hate it, but my lil' mama love it

[Hook]

[Sean P]
28 inches sittin tall, it's ridiculous
With a slum yellow bitch cause that's the type I kick it with
Ride with a stupid pack, and a couple stupid cats
They call us the Goon Squad, so you know we stupid strapped
Shuttin down the parkin lot, we doin the moonwalk
I ain't stuntin ass ho, cause I'm tryin to pillow talk
I be where that work at, where niggas get murked at
Earth is spread, then we mounted up and drop the purp' back
Can't you tell I'm hood rich? You ain't from my hood bitch?
Don't you see the leather seats? The way we grip the wood pimp?
Goin hard on 'em (goin hard on 'em) rocks shined on 'em (rocks shined on 'em)
Sponsored by the hood, this is our grind money
If we pop the bands on 'em (pop a band) throwin grands on 'em (throwin grands)
Nelly grab the wheel and make the Chevy dance on 'em
I'm a block star (block star) ain't a phony nigga (nah never)
A phone call'll have them youngsters all on ya nigga

[Nelly]
So don't start no shit, won't be no shit!
Don't start no shit, won't be no shit, boy!
