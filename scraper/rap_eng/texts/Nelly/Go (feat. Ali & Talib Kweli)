Life, what is it for real, I don't know
It's like hate taking over the whole world, what is it over?
Suicide, man, that's the devil trying to control us, they told us
,but we didn't notice the pain was sitting on they shoulders
The world was just a polar, the rather live in the solar
System got us hopeless, and focused on forclosures
Wake up and smell the folgers... oh momma and bring home the soldiers
Osama, you owe us, the 9 11 was bogus, now we right back at him
Say the war is our motive

Wake up early in the streets of the block, streets of the block
He posted up on the corner like a soldier in the drill but he wouldn't stop
Living life in the battlefield, battlefield, trying to survive every day and every night
It's the same deal
Lifes strange lifes strange ,times change times change, but karma always finds the way
Stay strong, stay strong, hold on, hold on
Don't let all your dreams fade away

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going,till it feels like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard,and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way

A lot of mothers they just don't understand, they just don't understand
They think we're hard on our sons but we gotta teach our boys how to be a man
They only know when they walk out the door, when they walk out the door
See we can show em how to fire but they gotta teach themselves how to reload
Cause unenployment is harder than its ever been, sometimes it feels like i can't win

And even through all the rules keep changing, I'm stronger now than I was when I came in

Yeah life can beat you down, what goes it comes around
It's not how you hit the ground, it's how fast you get back up
And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets hard, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way

Hey, hey, going through the back streets like i got beef
Carnival for carnivores with the sharp teeth
Animalistic it's why we call the cops beast
We're on the hunt, cause they're hungry for the dark meat
I'm rapping through my heart beat, brain is the base, my heart is the drum
Give the drum some, promis of a better life is all I got to give
I ain't just trying to survive, I'm trying to live

Cause all I want is a better way
Hey, if you're not prepared the world can be so cold
All that you can do is your best and just hope
In time the truth will show, just stick to what you know
Get a grip on something real and never let it go

And go, keep going, to feel like I'm giving my life away
Gets harder, and harder, happiness is worth the wait
Cause on my own is a better way
Cause on my own is a better way
