Country nigga fly
Country nigga fly
Country nigga fly
Country nigga fly
That country nigga fly
That country nigga fly

[Verse 1:]
I'mma boss hog riding hazard like a Duke boy
Make your neck jerk like a new boy
Erry summer I'm pulling out a new toy
Erry winter I'm pulling out a new toy
I love the new shit but my old school is better
My paint drippin wet, my inside dripping leather
With a hood bitch, been hood since I met her
Name tatted on her pussy and I'm lickin every letter
Everytime they see me out you know I (so clean on 'em)
Cuz I ball on another level (protein on 'em)
I used to cook it up and break it down (Triple beam on 'em)
Flyest thing you ever seen around, (You know wings on em)
I'm a strip club veteran, better than you than ever been
Louis knapsack full of racks and stacks when I'm comin' in
Let me in now, let me in now
King of Diamonds, Magic City, let me in now

[Hook:]
Ain't no doubt, show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly
That country nigga fly
That country, country, country, country nigga fly

[Verse 2:]
I can't help it, I was born in a slave state
I get it in from the Lou up to the Great Lakes
My great escape got big gates
Eatin' dinner off my money, call it paper plates
Now what you know about that (Free the king, nigga)
Now what you know about that
I pull up they say where you go and cop that
Tell em Dubai, not too far from ?
Back on a leer with a chick froma Niger
Blowin Amsterdam kush while she bitin' on my ear
I'm in minaj mode, I'm feelin so sincere
I ain't playin' wit you niggas I'm just tryna make it clear
I get it in when I step out
Pull up that Benz and pull the Bentley out
I'm who your friends is talking 'bout
If you ain't wit it lil mama you're missing out

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Missouri to Indiana, them country niggas fly
Louisiana to Alabama, them country niggas fly
Texas, Florida, Georgia, them country niggas fly
Tennesee to the Carolinas, them country niggas fly
I told you once, I'll tell you twice
Cheese in my grits, sugar on my rice
First niggas rockin' grills with the ice
Not every country motherfucker think alike, nah
East coast bitches call me mack daddy
My west coast wanna see my catdaddy
Swing a mean wood; I think I need a caddy
If I was Tiger, I'd a never got married, man

[Hook]
