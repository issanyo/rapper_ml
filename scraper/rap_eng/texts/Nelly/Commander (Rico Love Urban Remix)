[Intro: David Guetta & (Rico Love)]
Dance, dance, dance, dance

(Let me see you dance, let me see you dance, let me see you dance, I command you to dance, yeah)
Dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
I feel like the DJ is my bodyguard
You see the way he keeps me safe
With the treble and that bass
I feel free enough to party hard
This dress won't go to waste
Feels like I own the place, yeah
V.I.P to be the boss
You see the way these people stare
Watching how I fling my hair
I'm a dance floor lover
Baby there's no other
Who do it like I do it, yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland, David Guetta, Rico Love]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to
(Let me see you dance, let me see you dance, let me see you dance, I command you to dance, yeah)
Dance
(Let me see you dance, let me see you dance, let me see you dance, I command you to dance, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Ain't no reason to celebrate
But you know we gon' have a ball
Champagne spilling' from the wall
And I'll be partying 'til hella late
But I ain't worried, not at all
I just give my driver a call, yeah
Tell him pick me up at 8 AM
No, we ain't stopping right here
We'll take the party to the crib
Let's go all night, baby
You won't find no lady
Who does it like I does it, yeah

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Let me see you dance short, real slow
Let me see if you can move it like you say so
[?] shawty, hit the floor
Imma show you something that he didn't know, oh no
We ain't gotta stay here all night
We can take it back to the bed if you want to
Got my pole at the crib
[?]
I just wanna see you work it baby
Wanna lay back and observe you, baby
Watching you twisting and turning
I know it for certain, this [?] hurt you, baby
Cause tonight, me and you gettin' smashed
Rozay bottles to [?], no glass
You say your man don't love it when you dance
Shake your ass, make your boyfriend mad

[Chorus: Kelly Rowland]
From here on out
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer (I'll provide the answer)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander (I'll be your commander)
Right now I command you to
