Hat cocked can't see his eyes...who could it be
With the newest STL who there for me
Who else with us behind the tint of the new GT
The continental on blow got them feeling real blue
Till they stomachs sick to, furr real, they grossed out

Just to see when they roll out, I'm killin the folks now
His money just jinggy, my money it fort knox
Man, this happened vegas, and they hit me for a mil' worth
How many rappers man can tell you what a mil' worth
All my life damn worryin bout a mil' worth

You see I'm tired of playin games with
Niggas with money names
For real money, you lame
I put your money to shame
Ha, this ain't cynical
(Naw) This ain't subliminal
I'm physical, financial and mental to be a general
Yo momma clames she wants a {soldier}
Not the type that in the tank but in the {Rover}
Yea man you at the game orderin' refreshments
I'm on the floor watching my investment
Buttoned up, some call it grown up look
I like to call it havin money that fold up look
That Don Perignon, Chrystal cold duck look
Got her (whoa whoa whoa whoa)

(Chorus)
(whoa whoa whoa whoa)
