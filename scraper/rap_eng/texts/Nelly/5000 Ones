[Hook: Nelly]
I got 5000 ones, lookin' for the baddest bitch in the club
I'm lookin' for her (OH), I'm lookin' for her (OH)
I got 5000 ones when I see her pimp, I'm throwin' it up
I'm lookin' for her (OH), I'm lookin' for her (OH)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
See me when I walk in, ain't nothin' to it
Brought ten stacks to the back, then threw it
Make it rain, ain't a thing
When it come to money I got it, man
You the next best thang, I'm the hottest mayne
You talk that shit, I'm 'bout it, mayne
We way over here, up out your range
Don't try to be G, that's not your thang
You try me G, that Glock gon' bang
K-I-N-G, that's not gon' change
I'm rich bitch, I don't care about no fame
Cause if all else fails, I got cocaine
Still see me all on TV wit it
Still in da hood what ya need he get it
Dough low 44, see me with it
If a nigga runnin' up best believe he get it
See us in da club nigga, we be trippin'
Niggas rap 'bout that shit we livin'
7 or 8 stacks on 2 or 3 bitches
Sucka niggas over there hatin', we chillin'
I ran out of ones, so go back get more
Say shawty, bend it over back, real slow
Jack dat ass up, grab that pole
Show me you 'bout that action, hoe

[Hook: Nelly]

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Eeenie, meenie, miny, moe
I'm lookin' for the direction this money 'bout to go
I'm 'bout to blow, we pop bottles
Me and the whole clique certified shot callers, blow top dollars
Got this bitch jumpin' off the chain like Rottweilers
5000 ones, throw 'em then stop
See I'm lookin' for the baddest bitch
Splurge for a second when I'm done you can have this bitch

[Verse 3: Willie The Kid]
5000, 10,000, 20 - ones in my hand, that's good money
Ones in my fan, we get money, she pop that thang, she get that
That money's fallin' like rain, I'm VIP that's champagne
I'm K-I-D do my thang, and yes, indeed, I got change
Or shall I say I got paper, stacked money tall as skyscrapers
Hater's you fly I fly paper, she pop that thang she get that
She make it hot like wasabi, look at that body on mommy
She probably stand right beside me, and I tsunami lil' mommy

[Verse 4: Young Jeezy]
They call me Young, my money long
I make it rain, now loose your thong
Now loose your bottoms, now loose your tops
You saw what I just spent, I could've bought a watch
I could've bought a car, maybe a couple bricks
I send my hood bitch the fifths on a shoppin' trip
5000 ones, ya you know young wit it
So high up in the air, she need a flight to go get it
Still Mr. Magic City, you know no replacements
This is what I do I got a pole in my basement
If I can make it to Onyx, I bring Onyx to the condo
Call lil' bro bring me 20 grand pronto

[Hook: Nelly]

[Verse 5: Twista]
It's the Twista and can't nobody hold him

Get love in the strip club
Gotta nigga feeling so freaky they askin' is you roamin'
Yeah, makin' it rain is automatic when
She's askin if you trickin' you got it
Pimpin' is a habit from Twista Magic City
And the muthafuckin' betta bet not bitch about it
Steady stackin' paper
That's the reason we be throwin' it up
Dollas at the coke, they slang D
Really lil' momma all over DJ Drama
And T.I., Joc, and Nelly when we in da club
I'mma pop a couple of bottles
And I'mma start that good shit up
Got 5000 ones and I'm about to throw it up
Sip on some that Patron
I'mma 'bout put a hundred on one of them thongs
Gotta cup a lil' somethin' cause I pay the bill
Still money ain't shit, I make major deal
Better ring the alarm, here come the paper
Twista comin' in the club when I get I pop a lot
When she come up wit a fatty I gladly tip her
Jazze, tell 'em what I got
