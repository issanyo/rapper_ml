[Intro]
Uh, uh-uh uh
Yeah, uhh, yo
You wanna come go with me?
My nigga, that ain't no problem
My nigga, c'mon

[Chorus]
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

[Verse 1]
I said inhale, exhale
I heard your clientele is doin' well
I see you boomin' out the S-T-L
Pushin' a five hundred S-L
I heard you even got a child now (look at that)
A baby momma and a bow-wow
My nigga know you need to calm down
F-for County run up in your house
But you don't wanna hear that though, it's too late
Now the feds knocking at your door, you took the bait
They got taps on your mobile phone
They do surveillance all around your home
Now ya pawnin' everything ya own
Calling on your partners for a loan
No more slip and sliding on the chrome
Now your good days have come and gone
I tried to tell you

[Chorus]
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

[Verse 2]
Now baby girl, what's your name?
And tell me what's your claim to fame
Oh, I can tell you do your thing
Just by checking out your diamond ring
I see you at the mall every day
Buying Chanelle, Fendi, Donna K'
Plus I heard they took your job away
Ya got ya kids' shit on layaway
You got a 4-5 Infinity (you livin' large)
Like your last name was Kennedy (or El DeBarge)
Oh, I just can't believe
That you made that money righteously
The kids asking what they mommy do
And why she lock us in the bedroom
I think mommy getting paid to screw
'Cause every night it's a different dude
I tried to tell

[Chorus]
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side

[Verse 3]
Little man how old are you (you can tell me)
And what you doin' skippin' school?
I see you running with your lil' crew
Out here fightin' over red and blue
So now you wanna claim gangs
Even heard you bought a thumper mayne, and that ain't it
You started out with chronic on the brain
Now you're smokin' on amphetamines
I ain't tryin' to sell your dreams, just trying to show you
That's it's other ways to getting cream (Take it from me)
Just go to school and make somethin' of
Your young life and watch it blow up
And you ain't gotta stop bein' cool, and you ain't even gotta
Stop flossin' fancy jewels (and fast cars)
Just keep it real with your game son
And don't forget where you came from
I'm tryin' to tell ya

[Chorus]
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
And let me take you to the other side
I said you don't really wanna go, I can tell
But I'ma take you anyway, what the hell
So come on get on in the ride
