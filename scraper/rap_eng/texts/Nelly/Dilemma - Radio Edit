I, love you and I, need you
Nelly, I love you, I do
Need you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, ya know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Ya know I'm crazy over you

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing I've ever seen
But oh, no, no, she gotta man and a son though
But that's okay 'cause I
Wait for my cue and just listen play my position like
A short stop, pick up everything mommy hittin'
And in no time, I'm gonna make this friend mine
And that's for sure
'Cause I, I never been the type to break-up a happy home
But somethin' 'bout baby gurl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me ma what's it gonna be? Sshe said
"You don't know what you mean to me"

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy ya know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Ya know I'm crazy over you

I see a lot and you lookin' I never say a word
I know how niggas thought, trippin', and hurt up on their girls
And there's no way-ay Nelly go
(I ain't fightin' ova no dame)
Fight over no dame-ame as you can see
But I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla
And swoop me in his two-seater

Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it
But it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But you and me got ties for different reasons
I respect that
And right before I turned to leave
She said, she said, she said
"You don't know what you mean to me"

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy ya know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
Ya know I'm crazy over you

Sing it for me Kelly
And I love you, word?
And I need you, Nelly I love you
I do, come on girl and it's more than you'll ever know
Boy it's for sure, you can always count on my love
Forever more yeah
