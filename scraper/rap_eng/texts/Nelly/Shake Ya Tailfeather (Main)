(Bad Boys 2, the soundtrack)
(Let's go)
Hey girl, what your name is?
Where you from?
Turn around, who you came with?
Is that your ass or your momma have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here
I'm still a sucker for cornrolls
You know I never changed that
Your body is banging mamma
But where your brains at?
(Come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young
I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw
I'm running with bad boys
(That's right)
Here come another man
Unlike no other man
Candy coated, whoa
Switching in every lane
Y'all help me
Why don't cha
Please help me
A thug is we then it's only two G
I like the cocky bow legged ones
Like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians
Shake it for Nelly, son
Manolos, Ma-no-no's, I can't tell
Everybody and their hootchies
When you do it, do it well
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather
Now real girls get down on the floor
(On the floor)
Get that money, honey, act like you know
(Like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance
The way you fit in them pants
Enter the floor, take it low, girl do it again
You know I love that
(I love that)
Now where them girls at?
(Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee, and Nelly
How you love that?
(Shit, uh ohh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty
How they loving it player?
Baby, you impressive
Let's get to know each other
You the best of the best
And you got to love it in the dresses, the sexiest
I had to tell her she's a young
Janet Jackson live in living color
Look here momma you're dead wrong
For having them pants on
Capri's cut low so when you shake it
I see you're thong
My pocket's full of dough
Shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly
Man, somebody better warn them
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go

Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow

Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start thumping
Because my mic still on
Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right
Banging personality conversate when the time right
I'm not hard I've got women to handle that
They be like, "He the man" when I'm really a Thundercat
Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap
And the seats that I got in the lap
I'm just a juvenile
(Wha)
Because I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy, man
They say they have my babies
I'm young like Tucker like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money)
Man, I'm that damn hungry
See I'm starving like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I was valet parking
Let me see you take it off
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather, girl go and take it low
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tail feather
Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now
Got to continue my running
(Yeah)
Because we go party till them lights come on
And then my song start thumping
Because my mic still on
(Man)
