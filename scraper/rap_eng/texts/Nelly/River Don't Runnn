[Introduction: Stephen Marley]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, right down
Right down, light on, right down

[Hook: Nelly]
They say, walk down the river
'Cause the river don't run
Same thing makes you laugh, makes you cry
That's why what goes around comes around, my son
They say, walk down the river
'Cause the river don't run
Same thing makes you laugh, makes you cry, come on
Plus I got the rocks, them yellow diamonds and that bling

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah
And, I've got two twin Cutlass's interior gatored
I call them Now and Later's 'cause they're candy flavoured
You see, I drive one now and drive the other one later
Shit, it's the new Fresh Prince and all I'm missing is Jada
I've got a hard drive, all I'm missing is data
Please give my number to your sister, I've been missing a dater
I hate to hate a hater, in fact I hate to hate
Hating is hating, you should never hate, congratulate
Look here, my attitude is sensed that you may never know my mind
I know just what I'm thinking if I don't want you inside
Yeah, inside my mental, I know you meant well
I'm Out Of Time and out of Training Days like Denzel
Never the gangster type, more like a hustler, man
I fuck them ones up out them Playboy books and Hustler, man
Honeys and Black Tails, the King magazines
The Maxim or the Eye Candy, Jet Beauty Queens

[Hook: Nelly]

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a spit it 'til I really can't spit it no more
Nothing's changed, cell phone's still three-one-four
No, the Derrty ain't moved to near East, West coast
I'm a Midwest swinger 'cause they love me the most
Some like me humble, others like me to boast
Please, my whole life is alphabets and numbers
I take a G4, land to that H2 Hummer
Leave at seven-forty-five in LA for the summer
I've got the worldwide sale to check the e-mail
Plus, four-oh-one K plan in A-T-L
Got eight females, I see them all from eight to twelve
The only player who can ball without his A.C.L
Who may not be original but still a don-dada
I'm gon' take this beat and flip it, I'm gon' make it hotter
You go ahead and take your plane and I'm gon' take the chopper
I'm tired of niggers' fronting like they're top gun shotters' (hey)

[Hook: Nelly]

[Bridge: Stephen Marley]
Not come running over, Jah-Jah shine his light
Blessed is the day, sacred is the night
Wrong wishers beware now that I am here
Hey, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lord
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy Lord

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Shoot, they thought a Derrty wouldn't make it this far
Now I'm supporting my family, they liking who I are
Schoolboy's a hard worker, they consider him a star
I guess that's why they look at us as if we're from Mars
Singin-a-ling, I deal with bars like weight trainers
Hustling's got me bigger like weight gainers
Always remain a Saint Louis entertainer
My women love me later, how could a hater blame her
Shoot, I'm just that dude that kicks bars for a living
Get rich and trick, collect cars for a living
Houses on hills, with great lakes in the back
Bowling alleys in basements, beds bigger than Shaq's
Damn, look at the leather in that old school 'Llac
They be doo-doo green, I wonder who would do that
The original rude dude, considered too cool
Probably know me from touching your booty at school
