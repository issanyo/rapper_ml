[Verse 1]
Johnson
I start this adventure off with nonsense
I beg your pardon
Surely you know my family's partridge
You beg my pardon
Surely you know this knife will end your life
So stride with caution
I do this often
On the weekends I bet she bets her bubble ass with all the SHIT she's talking
But whenever she decides to perk a set of her oxycontin
Breasts into my face well shit, then I guess now we're fuckin'
I'm regretting nothin' even if its rape I'm sure she'll love it

[Chorus]
I'm headed back to the safe and unlocking this shit
I'm back again
I'm going back to the stage where my audience sits
Nigga, I'm back again

[Verse 2]
I'm back again like I'm spyin' on Madison
I'm not petty, but I know I have a source, with acumen
It say Benzino bends reality like all these men and all these men can't see the truth because we have our sanity and hardly can
So now I have to find an addict that won't mind to spend
A few clams for 40 grams of granny's Ritalin
My steez is high so when I urinate I'm swaggin'  Iggy's man
Put the minivan in reverse it'll tell you that I'm Iggy's man

[Chorus]
I'm headed back to the safe and unlocking this shit
I'm back again
I'm going back to the stage where my audience sits
Nigga, I'm back again

[Verse 3]
I'm ridin' the wave i guess I'm all up in the motion again
I'm all up in the Ocean like Frank opened his legs
I'm focused on the better things
Like honeymoons and wedding rings
I marry beauty you marry booty that's some asinine year old shit
Of course I'm tossing shade at your sunny day
You married ass my oxygen is leaving me i am refusing to believe it
I'm tryna fix you and your vows like I O U this shit
I'm back to help you my brother just open to this, this

[Chorus]
I'm back to the safe and unlocking this shit
I'm back again
I'm going back to the stage where my audience sits
Nigga, I'm back again
I'm feeling like myself, as of now I'm back in this bitch
I'm back again
I'm back to starting up a ruckus and just kicking up shit
Nigga, I'm back again

[Outro]
Fuck
