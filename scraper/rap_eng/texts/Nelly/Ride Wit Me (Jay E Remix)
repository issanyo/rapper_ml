[Intro]
Yo, hey yo..
Now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high (uh)
Niggas wanna know why (why), why I fly by
But yo it's all good, Range Rover, all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, wishin' you was niggas
Poppin' like we drug dealers, sippin' Cris-sy, bubb' mackin' (macker)
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy cris, tellin' me to leave, leave wit you and your friends

[Hook]
I wanna know if you wanna ride (wanna ride)
Wanna go and take a ride with me (oh)
I know a place where we can chill them (oh)
And don't worry I got plenty money
Oh, oh, oh, hey..

[Verse 1]
We in the club on a late night, we feelin' right (oh)
Lookin' for lil shorties that's gon' do me right (hey)
And they can be 21 or 20 years old (oh)
Long as they got ID, man I don't need no troubles (hey oh)
Than I peep two walking over nice and real slow (here they go)
They said they liked the way I looked in my last video (oh)
Is there somewhere Nelly, all three of us could go (oh)
I thought about it for a minute then I said
Hmm...(hell yea)

[Verse 2]
We still shoppin' nightly, frontin' like me and my boys
E'ery other mall, I'm pullin' out another toy (hey oh)
My pockets deeper than they've ever, ever been before
I'm not just braggin', I'm just sayin' I ain't gotta think about that shit no more
All of a sudden, I'm the man wherever I go (oh)
Screamin' fans got to stands now at my shows (oh)
Heard there's a party and the niggas at 'The Palm' try to figure out should I go (oh)
Thought about it for a minute then I said
Hmm...(hell yea)

Oh, oh, oh...yea, oh

[Verse 3]
I know somethin', somethin' you don't know (you don't know)
I know somethin', somethin' I got to tell ya (I got to tell ya)
I know somethin', somethin' doubted my flow (doubted my flow)
I know somethin', somethin' called me a failure (hey)
I know somethin', somethin' you don't know (you don't know)

Oh, oh, oh...must be the money
Oh, oh, oh...I said
And don't worry I got plenty money
Hey..

You know we pronounce it different in the hood
But dirty, you still be rockin'
