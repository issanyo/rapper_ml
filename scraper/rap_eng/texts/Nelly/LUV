[Intro]
Yes mate
MC Kaneo back on the ones and tunes
Drinking my Special Brewns
Been away for three years now, went prison for stealing some crisps from Safeway
[?]
Got myself a girlfriend so this one goes out to 'er
Shout out MC Dave, Dealer Dave and Mister Dave
Here we fuckin' go

[Verse 1]
Tonight's the night yeah, it's that time
Time to dance around 'n' dine
Drinking wine yeah with the girly
Shaggin' you until it's early

Morning breath nah, it don't matter
Love you when you're thin or fatter
And your tits are bigger
Let me put it up your shitter

Off our heads on ket 'n' coke
I am not your average bloke
Treat you well and buy you roses
Snortin' Charlie up our noses

Love you til the day I die and I'm dancin' in the sky
Been with you for three weeks now
Posh 'n' Becks, talk of the town

[Chorus: Nelly's Just a Dream & MC Kaneo]
Ayyyy
I was thinking 'bout us
Thinking about me
Thinking 'bout us
When we gon' be
Just drink my Special Brewn quickly
Fuckin', that's the potions of the Gods right there [?]
Fuckin' yeah
When she come back, no one knows
Fuckin' yes mate
(It was only just a dream)

[Verse 2]
When I saw you in your tracksuit
I knew it was meant to be
Wide awake while livin' a dream
Hopin' that you weren't fourteen

I can't afford a horse and carriage
Or your hand in fuckin' marriage
But I'll do my best to sort out our gaff out
We can blast some garage

When I'm on the mic bring the party alive
Rahh
Bad boys we're in town tonight
This one's [?] for you tonight
When I'm on the mic
When I'm on the mic
When I'm on the when I'm on when I'm on when I'm on
When I'm on when I'm on the mic
Bidibidibidibidi bassline

[Chorus: Nelly's Just a Dream & MC Kaneo]
I was thinking 'bout us
Thinking 'bout me
Yes mate, shout out Special Brewns
MC Kaneo on the ones and tunes
Love you, love you babe
Shout out MC Dave
Dealer Dave, not on good terms at the moment
But Mister Dave, I'll see you on Tuesday
Shag the fuckin' birds to this one
