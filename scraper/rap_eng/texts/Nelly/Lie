La la la la la, la-la-la-la

[Nelly]
Uhh, uhh yo yo
Yo I'm tired of the "he say she say"
Why every time they get mad man we pay?
She wanna act like the judge and the jury
The police, F.B.I. and the C.I.A. (all in one)
And now it's me she tryin to convict
She better show me some DNA and fingerprints
She better show me the name of the one that snitched
Matter fact, right now I'mma plead the fifth

[Hook: Nelly] + (Keri Hilson)
(She said you tried to fuck her)
She's a motherfuckin liar
(Boy please) No way (whatever) not me
(Yeah you) Man, she's just hatin
(She said you met her last summer)
She's a motherfuckin liar
(Boy please) No way (whatever) not me
(Yeah you) Girl, you sound crazy
(She said y'all exchangin numbers)
She's a motherfuckin liar
(Boy please) No way (whatever) not me
(Yeah you) Fellas what we gon' do - what?
Take it to the grave - what? Take it to the grave
Take it to the grave, I'mma take it to the grave
I'mma take it to the grave - you better take it to the grave
Take it to the grave, I'mma take it to the graaaaave!

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo (is she serious?)
She said she did what, with who? She wrong
Since she knows so much ask her what I had on
True Religion, Air Jordan, Ed Hardy?
C'mon ma, that's e'ry nigga in the party
But I was at the studio perfectin my hustle
With Ky', Murph' and Mo just finishin "Brass Knuckles"
Now with all these purses, fur coats, fly whips
I done bought for you, now you still believe any chick?
Is you serious?

3:24 when I walk in the do' (oh)
Phone on loud, what it do that fo'? (damn)
She said she went down south, all in my texts
6:30 in the mornin got this loud-ass message
I ain't even do it though, mama girl lyin
{You tried to fuck her} I ain't even had time
Ask her where she know me from, who I be with?
What number she dial? That crazy girl wild

[Kyjuan]
I really don't know her, I seen her on MySpace
Looked at her page, all I seen was my face
Her username read, "Kyjuan fo' life"
With videos and pictures, set up so right
The only bad thing is she writes me all night
Sayin shit like, "The 'Tics is so tight"
She ends with I love you, that starts the big fight
Baby, I can't control what she types
Believe me
