They say I was always destined for fortune and fame
Now that I've gotten what I wanted everything's changed
And now I'm living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
I left behind everybody I know

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life

They say you have to come clean with your past to move on
All of my dreams have come true but something still feels wrong
But I'm still living the
High life, high life
I never looked back once I left my hometown
High life, high life
Said goodbye to everybody I know

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life

Everybody's dreaming of the high life
It may look good from the outside
But all I really wanted was a good life
With a memory reel of all the highlights
All I want is to sleep good at night
Look myself in the mirror knowing that I live right
So when I'm six feet in the ground
I'll be singing like

A million dollars in palm
Not a worry in the world, that's everything I want
I'm wishing I was there I feel like it's where I belong
I wanna be able to go pay all the bills for my mom
And make her smile
Pick up my family and take em out
On me
And my over capacitated bank account
Money is all I think about
Of my life it's a highlight
Tired of being low I'm ready for the high life
Look at me now
Look at how I get down
Stubs and Wooten on my feet
I'm the flyest youngin in town
But I'm loosin it
My vision has just become an illusion
And Now my highlife is low again
Struggling to hold it in I was on a mission
And messed everything up making all the wrong decisions
I know it's not the end Well then again it might be
And it's sucks god forbid you ever end up like me

And now I'm singing like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
And everybody sings along like

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
Be careful when you're wishing for the high life
