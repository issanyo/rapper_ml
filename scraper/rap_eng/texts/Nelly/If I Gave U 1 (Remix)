It's like no matter what I try to do I just can't make her happy
See every other day is like she throwing new shit at me
A constant petty complain about every single thing
Hard to swagga maintain Shorty driving me insane
And in the beginning I'll Admit it, if you said it I was on it
And even if I thought you did me wrong Girl I was coping
I guess a nigga was hoping thinkin bout eloping
See I just call it focus, but some might call it open
It's like I'm compromising everything I stood for
I'm breaking rules that every nigga in the hood know
One, weigh it yourself, two, never play yourself, three, it don't matter girl
I throw em out the window cause for you

I bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me

A litile bit goes a long way
If I give you one, would you want two, if I give you two
Would you want three
They say A litile bit goes a long way
If I give you one, would you want two, if I give you two
Would you want three

Somebody say relationships should be like 50-50
How come I feel I'm giving mine but not receiving any
Why must you make it so hard to play the part
I put you in the light but yet you leave me in the dark
And every time I think of you before, you go back
And every time I think our train is straight you jump track
What the fuck was that?
You always doing that, let me turn the shit on you
And let mesee how you react

It's like I'm compromising everything I stood for
I'm breaking rules that every nigga in the hood knows
One, weigh it yourself, two, never play yourself, three, it don't matter girl
I throw em out the window all for you

I bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me

A litile bit ... goes a long way
If give you one, would you want two,if I give you two
Would you want three X 2

If I gave in inch, would you want a foot
If I gave that foot, would you want a yard
If I gave that yard, would you want a mile
If I gave that mile, would you want the town?
I wanna give everything you want
I wanna be everything you need
I'm right here for you baby girl
Don't have you worry about anything

Id bend over backwards, I'd do anything you say
I'm here for you baby, don't have to worry about me

A litile bit ... goes a long way
If I give you one, would you want two,if I gave you two
Would you want three X 2
