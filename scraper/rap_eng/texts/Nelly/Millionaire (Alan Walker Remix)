(C'mon)
I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
Whenever she comes around
(Uh huh!)
Whenever i hear the sound
(Hey Hey!)

Smell like money when she walk by
All heat, no smoke, but she on fire
If they suicide doors, then she gon' ride
She got that passport p*ssy 'cause she don't fly
No love
(Hey!)
She gon' make you pay to see you work it
She only twerk it for a birkin
(A!)
I gotta see if shawty worth it
Hey, she must be the money!

I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
Whenever she comes around
(Uh huh!)
Whenever i hear the sound
(Yeah!)

I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
I feel like a millionaire
(Uh huh!)
Whenever she comes around

[Music]

Hey, she must be the money!
Shawty work the way, the way she go down
Shawty worth her weight, her weight in gold pounds
Call me young money put that milli on me
She the reason why i keep the milli on me
Shawty work the way, the way she go down
Shawty worth her weight, her weight in gold pounds
Call me young money put that milli on me
'Cause she the reason why i keep the milli on me
(Yeah!)

Hey, she must be the money!
Hey, she must be the money!

I feel like a millionaire

Whenever she comes around
Whenever i hear the sound

[Music]

Hey, she must be the money!
