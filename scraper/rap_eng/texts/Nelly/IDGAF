[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hold up hold up
Hey you got me more of me on the motherfucking train
Hit the club till the DJ run that motherfucking thang
Gone bout that action shawty you ain't gotta ask
Ye ain't seen king with a bitch if she ain't gotta ass
Man a nigga be about that game I ran that
If I throw over some [?] she ain't my main thang
When I run that rough shit a honey wanna run from me
Call 911 shawty

[Verse 1: Nelly]
If they call the cops on me, IDGAF
I won't stop no, IDGAF, baby
Baby girl you should call me tonight
Them other niggas don't know how to talk to you right
You understand what I'm offering right? IDGAF

[Bridge: Nelly]
Shake your thang one time for me, (then repeat, repeat, repeat)
Fill my glass one time for me, (then repeat, repeat, repeat)
I’m even talkin’ to the girls outside (then repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat)
Shake your thang one time for me, (then repeat, repeat, repeat)

[Hook: Nelly]
Girl, let's do it over and over again
I'm not selfish, bring your friend
See the morning ain't up, so repeat
You gotta repeat

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Everybody watching, ho IDGAF
Ain't no way you stopping, no IDGAF
Baby girl we play that shit

[Bridge: Nelly]

[Hook: Nelly]

[Verse 3: Nelly]

You sit on top, I be inside it, inside it
You know, You know
Let's go, baby

Let’s back on the R8 out, IDGAF
Drop the top throw the deuce we out, IDGAF baby

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Hold up

Throw it out, I’m down with it

[Hook: Nelly]
