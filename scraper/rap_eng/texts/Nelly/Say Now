[Verse 1: Nelly]
Gun shots ringed out over the city
And had everybody duckin and runnin checkin for any
Kinda shelter cause them peoples man they at it again
If you ain't heard or seen it then you better pretend
Ain't got no time for stoppin ain't no catchin your wind
Ya baby mammas on the porch tellin her daughters "come in"
Got fathers grabbin sons "where the hell have you been?"
Boy and y'all just startin young I'm talkin 13 and 10
They started tradin in the streets some type of ghetto battles
But they ain't hoopin in the gym they hoopin crates in the alleys
Where else can you shoot a jump shot
Slang a rock all from the same spot?
Got one gang on this half the other gang
On the other half of the same block
Gunplay on Monday
Sundays a fun day
Will it stop one day?
I can't call it no way
When your gettin started everybody wanna help and get you off
But turn around first motherfuckers wanna see you fall

Say now (say now)
Can you hoes come out to play now? (play now)
Say now (say now)
Can you hoes come out to play now? (play now)
Say now (na na na na)
Can you hoes come out to play now? (na na na na na na na na)
Say now (na na na na)
Can you hoes come out
Na wait a minute na wait a minute na wait a minute na

[Hook: 2x]
Feel like I'm runnin for the daylight
Tryin ta get my mind right
And just before I die will somebody reach out and snatch it from me
Say now
Can you hoes come out to play now?

[Verse 2: Nelly]
(Hear me out)
Tryin ta put my city on the map and they mad at me
The same city some of them live in and they mad at me
When I come down to speak derrty why you mad at me?
Is it cause the old school freaked out niggas from A to Z?
Eight cd's, tv's, I aim to please
They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's
Like Eazy to E's, 2Pac to overseas
And I done seen more Aaliyah fans fall cry to their knees
I tell ya, I ain't been livin this life for too long
And I can't count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong
Why my mother was gone
Why my daddy wasn't home
And the same shit they told me I found myself tellin my own
Now its good-bye bad nights
Hello good times
There ain't no way Ill let no nigga step in my shine
Keep tryin (keep tryin)
Theres bound ta be somethin G
As long as I'm in STL
You in the TIC
I'll tell ya
