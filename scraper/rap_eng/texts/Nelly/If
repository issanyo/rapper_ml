We All We Got
StarTracks on the G-M-B

[Verse 1]
I'm not the man sittin' next to the man
But I'm the man sittin' wonderin' if I'mma ever see you again
If I'mma ever get the chance to hug and squeeze you again...
I swear I'll never leave you again
You ain't gotta worry bout it (Woo)
Dirty a simple man
I run up on you, "man and all", I ain't no minute man
A G-4 headin' straight for Switzerland
Or end up in the 8th mile down in Michigan
She so fit (man) an S-T-L Hottie
Apple Bottom denim
The flyest thang in the party
Baby last name it should be MO-Lotty
Got mo' back than she got body (Eh!)
Fall back, get 'Cris and drin' it up
Tomorrow hit the mall
And 'Cris you d-it up
Credit card to the max
Come Back!
I re. it up
If I'm movin' too fast fo' ya
Hurry to speed it up
Or ease up, whichever one you prefer
With yellow diamonds or the whites
Whichever one you prefer
Cali we do the drop
New York we do the fur
East Coast, West Coast, whichever one you prefer!

[Hook]
(If I couldn't...)
Take you...
Around the world...
(Take you around that w-orld
Then Shorty would you be my girl...?)
Hey
(Would you be my?)
Buy you cars (Woo), credit cards (Woo)
Big jewelry with diamonds, girl
(Woo, would you still be my girl...?)
Hey
(Would you be my?)

[Verse 2]
No NBA but I could handle rock
I'm a different kinda' balla' baby, feel or not (Feel or not)
Yea I'm a playa' and I crush a lot
I also puff a lot
But I'll stop if you fuss a lot
Err-thing I done done you ain't satisfied
And you don't wanna' answer to my "Who's?" and my "Why's?" (Eh)
Just throw me back my keys to my CL55
Better hurry the bus leave at 7:55 (55)
WE OFF THAT
Take you to the field, ma
Let you ride horse back
Yea I'm 50 miles from the arch and all that
But from the bedroom, balcony, you can see all that
I can see ya point now like
"What do you call that?"
Got all these damn cars
"Where the hell do ya' park at?"
We used to ask "What it cost?"
Now it ain't no more a'that
I made it so ya' own mama call ya a spoiled brat

[Hook]
(If I couldn't...)
Take you...
Around the world...

Then shorty would you be my girl...?)
Hey

Buy you cars (Woo), credit cards (Woo)
Big jewelry with diamonds, girl
(Woo, would you still be my girl...?)
Hey

[Verse 3]
Take you (take you)
Girl if I couldn't
Take you (take you)
If I couldn't
Take you around the world
Tell me would you still be my girl?
If I couldn't
Take you (take you)
Now way to
Take you (take you)
Girl if I couldn't
Take you around the world
Tell me would you still be my girl?
