Like dat (like dat)
I went from mac flippin off a mattress on the vilkin lot
To back flippin in the ocean off a yellow yacht
From hundred pennies worth of candy at the corner store
To hundred thou on rodeo just a day ago
Yea, the trials and tributes of a country nigga
Multiple personalities, I'm a bunch of niggas
So far out they reach, they say I'm out of touch from niggas
Too much temptation, I ain't gone, David rough the nigga
Click! That's my swag getting turned on
Shorty see me in the Lamb, now she turned on
More loop, the king of the ave, I just turned on
Saint Louis nigga, watch me put my bird on
Straight up (like dat)
I wake up (like dat)
I blaze up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm caked up (like dat)
I came up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm like dat, like dat
You talk shit and it's like dat
I got a bad bitch, she like dat
I give her everything, she come right back
Like dat, like dat
My whole town be like dat
Don't play around, nigga like dat
Shut shit down, straight like dat
Uh, I'm Dukes of Hazard playin dodge, 8 bricks in the Charger
Inside my hood they call me Ace, yea I hustle harder
I started up behind a bitch but now I play the starter
Tangle up so many rocks, they call it Mr. Carter
Mr. Cate, G I'm talkin sure
My money disrespectful, ghost Phantom, sleep on my lawn
My Drisco well in distance like Diddy with Sean John
I got the streets so my bitch on lash, I can't post no bond
Nah, tell them niggas I'm like dead beat
Summing up, they don't fight back
Up in Barcelona, no flight back
In the outtie 8 til bank black
Hundred grand a spill so I backpack
And fear the safety, come right back
Build it back up just like dat
Straight up (like dat)
I wake up (like dat)
I blaze up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm caked up (like dat)
I came up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm like dat, like dat
You talk shit and it's like dat
I got a bad bitch, she like dat
I give her everything, she come right back
Like dat, like dat
My whole town be like dat
Don't play around, nigga like dat
Shut shit down, straight like dat
I came up just like dat
My X texts, I ain't write back
Til I came around with my new bitch
She like Daniel, it's like that
Ride around to that pimpsy
With your girl and her 2 friend
I don't drink but it's tradition
I sip syrup in Houston
I fell in love at the strip clubs
She fell in love with my clique
Goddamn right, bandz a make er dance
Shit, I'm tryina make enough to make her quit
In the cut with Dirty Mo
Yea, young nigga on the move
Mama tell your friends your son is on TV and I ain't on the news, word
Now they all call cause they see I'm hot
And they see a nigga buzzin like a beehive drop
Don't be fooled by this brand new Rolly baby, I've been getting money since ER dropped
Hotels I spend nights at, that pussy good enough to miss he flight back
Black card, I swipe dat
10 thousand just like dat, word
Straight up (like dat)
I wake up (like dat)
I blaze up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm caked up (like dat)
I came up (like dat)
Straight up (like dat)
I'm like dat, like dat
You talk shit and it's like dat
I got a bad bitch, she like dat
I give her everything, she come right back
Like dat, like dat
My whole town be like dat
Don't play around, nigga like dat
Shut shit down, straight like dat
