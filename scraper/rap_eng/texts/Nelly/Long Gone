[Verse 3: Plies]
E'rybody turn around and wave at the buster
He in the club with his bitch 'cause he don't trust her
One wrong move and I'ma fuck her
You a lollipop, nigga, you a sucker
You broke and she like hustlers
I'm rich and I like whore
Hey buster, last chance
If that's your bitch, you better hold her hand
'Cause you don't go to the beach and bring sand
I want your bitch, you know my plan
I got a hundred racks in my pants
If anybody lame, it's your man, hah

[Chorus: Nelly & Chris Brown]
Man, you better leave your girl at home, man (you better leave her)
'Cause if I catch her in the club all alone, man (oh)

Man, you better leave your girl at home, man (oh, girl)
'Cause if I catch her in the club all alone, man (oh)
She gon' be long, she gon' be gone
She gon' be, yeah, she gon' be, yeah, yeah (yeah)
