[Hook]
When my man leave the house, I know he's coming right back
I got that good good, I got that good good
No matter how much he might try to act, he know just where it's at
I got that good good, I got that good good

I put it on him right, I do it every night
I leave him sitting mouth open like whew
So I don't worry bout nobody taking mine
Cause I know just the right thing to do (I got that good good)

[Verse 1]
I ain't never had a problem with the one (no)
Never been worried bout him ever cheating on me (fo'sho)
Cause when I say I got that pop lock and drop it believe me
If I'm with you, it's gon' kill you on the days you don't see me

See the things I possess, a lot of women don't (don't)
And the things Ima do for mine, most won't (won't)
I hear 'em talking bout it when I'm up in the salon
Crying cause they man ain't come home, I try to tell 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ladies don't believe half what you hear, cause it's all a waste of time
If you know you got that good, good good, everything will be just fine
So let your man be the man when he's in public (in public)
Even though behind the scenes y'all be runnin (be runnin')
Let him run with his boys, let him play his little games
Let him drive his Cadillac, don't worry he'll be back

[Hook]

[Bridge]
If you got that good good and you know it, ladies show him where's it at
(right here) Where it's at (right here)

See, I don't know what them other girls be doing, they be crying 'bout they man
Cause they always losing
They need that (good good) gotta have that (good good) to keep him (good good)
You need that (good good)
