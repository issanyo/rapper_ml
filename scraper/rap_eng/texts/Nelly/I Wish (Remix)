[Intro: Bei Maejor]
Why don't you call no more, I'm not sure
Thought you were the one for me
The only girl I adore, now you belong to someone else

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Yeah, I wish that I just can rewind, take it back in time
A couple years to when you were just a friend of mine
Around the time I started noticing that you was fine
The biggest notice was to notice why you wasn't mine
I recognize I'm in the stage girl, I admit it
Didn't see just what I had shawty, I was tripping
If I told I'm a mess, would that make a difference?
I'd have traded my success for you in a minute, second
Probably roll your eyes when you get this message
Feeling like the homie when that nigga sang Confessions
But this is my confession, I'm nothing girl without you
And if you take me back, I'll make it up in part 2
I wish I never let you go

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
Never let you go, you should know
I want you to come home, but you ain't got love for me
No love, no love, my baby
But now you belong to someone else

[Verse 2: Nelly]
I hate the situation's different but my heart's the same
I hate the fact we gotta play these little stupid games
I hate the fact another nigga fucking my girl
I hate the fact another nigga fucking my girl
You see the past is the past, can we leave it there?
I put it all on the table, you need a chair
And tell your mama I still love her
And let her know I still look out for your brother, for you, umm
And when I think about the things we used to do
Wishing I can rearrange time and start new
Time to write a sequel, we need a part 2
But you say in part 1, I didn't played my part, true
I know that's where I'm wrong
But don't let a few bad notes end a great song
And don't let all of these hating ass bitches tell you wrong
I'ma keep holding on 'til my life's gone
I wish I never let you go

[Chorus: Bei Maejor]
Never let you go, you should know
I want you to come home, but you ain't got love for me
No love, no love, my baby
But now you belong to someone else
Never let you go
