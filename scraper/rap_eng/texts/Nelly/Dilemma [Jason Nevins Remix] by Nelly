I love you, and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do need you

[Chorus]
"No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do
All Ithimk about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you"
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
She got the hot's for me, the finnest thing I'll ever see
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son,oh-oh
But that's o.k. cuz I, wait for my cue and just listen
Play my position like a short stop pick up everthing mami is hittin'
And in no time, I better make this friend mine
And that's for sure cuz I
Never been the typeto break up a happy home
But there's something about baby girl I just can't leave her 'lone
So, tell me ma' what's it gonna be she said
You don't know what you mean to me, come on

[Chorus]
I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
I know how start actin tripin', and hate up all the girls
And there's no way Nellt gon' fight over
No dame, as you could see
But, I like your steeze, your style
Your whole demeanor the way you
Come through and holler,and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget but it
Ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave
But you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that right before I turned and leave she said
You don't know what you mean to me, come on

[Chorus]
I love you and I need you
Nelly I love you, I do
And it's more than you ever know
Boy, it's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more yeah, yeah
East coast, I know you're shakin' right
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right
Cause you don't know what you mean to me
Midwest, I see you swingin' right
East coast, I know you you're shakin' rigth
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right
Cause you don't know what you mean to me

East coast, I know you're shakin' right
Down south, I know you're bouncin' right
West coast, I know you're walkin' right

[Chorus]
