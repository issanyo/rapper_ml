[Chorus]
Just walked through the door what's it gonna be
I can't get to the floor boys all over me
Where my party, party, party, party people at?
Where my party, party, party, party people at?
Just walked thru the door what's it gonna be
I can't get to the floor girls all over me
Where my party, party, party, party people at?
Where my party, party, party, party people at?

It's Nelly (Wait a minute) comin' straight up out the Lou
And all you New Edition rappers better cool it now
For I make a fool of ya
Paper stacked as tall as Yao
Ming look at the bling setting in rings lookin' like basketballs [Repeat: x2]

[Chorus]

Where my party people at? [Repeat: x8]
Well it's Fergie I'm the Dutchess comin' straight from California
Stuntin' in my loc locs? Dreamin' bout me M-I-A
Boyfriend wonderin' where I'm at cause I'm in the spot spot
Why he always tryin' to be puttin' me down on lock lock [Repeat: x2]

[Chorus]
[Nelly]
Visually waitin' and takin' my time
Watchin' these haters don't come with they rhymes
Watchin' these suckers are mimickin', gimmickin' then they start fallin' off one at a time
You can go search but you never could find
I promise you dirty I'm one of a kind
Mold is broken the formulas mine
I killed the idea and destroyed the design

[Fergie]
I was patiently waitin' and takin' my time
Now that I'm here I'm gettin' my shine
All of you haters can kiss a behind specifically speakin' I'm talkin' bout mine
Don't need you to tell me I know that I'm fine
I'm killin' it baby so call it a crime
Yea you watch it I'm stealin' my time
I told you before that big girls don't cry
Where my party people at?

[Chorus]
