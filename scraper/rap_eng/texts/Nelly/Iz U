We spending money like whatever (whatever)
You see me poppin' bottles at the bar
It feels like now or never (never)
Please don't put 'cha bet down mo'
If it ain't four or better
I'm talking Pete Rose at the end of the road
Playboy fuck what you was told
Watch....me and my dirty
City scoped the whole hood
We be lookin' for the ones in tight jeans
The lust (the lust) never good
I'm like the Apple Bottom high tight things
Ain't disrespectin' (ahhh) didn't good
I didn't cause you harm
But I was reachin' for your arm
When you walked past
And I missed and I grabbed your ass
My bizzard
Feels like I'm learnin' 35
In a A3 cup in a Deezeevees
Whatever I desire (desire)
I want a 600 coupe wit the laser cut key
Before (before) I retire
Baby girl I got to have it all
8 cars in a stall
Them planks down the hall
That lead to the room where the draws gon' fall
Coolest nigga ever seen (seen)
It ain't shit my nigga I'll show ya
Ones on triple-beam
Let it on out baby girl don't you know
I love to hear you scream
Wanna hit it a lil' harder
Somethin' like a daughter
I finally caught her
Lil' chicky like a fish outta water (water water)

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse 3]
Now ladies put your hands up
And bounce with me now
Fellas put your hands down
And smack a lil' ass with me now
Gon' give that girl the eye
And tell 'em meet u outside
Cuz we ain't got nowhurr to (gooo but home)
And see about the curb (the curb)
Go on get your friend's baby girl
Im likin' (like it) when you swerve (you swerve)
Tell me can you drive a stick
If not (if not) then can you learn (you learn)
Cuz you comin' on me like this your first time
Give me your birth date and your birth sign (scorpio)
Same as mine
I'll meet you down the street (the street)
On natural bridge down the King's highway
We will chill in (chillin') with my peeps (my peeps)
That L-U-N-A-T-I-C
Oh you fo' reel
We're not filthy rich but we could use a bath
Let a chick take half
Don't want that math
And I speak on behalf of my whole damn staff
I can see (see) what you thinkin'
You know you want it as bad as I do
Tell me (tell me) what you drinkin'
Pimp Juice?
Oh I got a case of that too
And that shit stankin' (stankin')
Like Cali chronic for them LA boys
That purple haze for them glassy jars
Fuck Lana, baby I want Mo

[Chorus: 4x]

And bounce with me now
Smack a lil' ass with me now
Tell 'em meet you outside
Cuz we got nowhere to goo... but home
