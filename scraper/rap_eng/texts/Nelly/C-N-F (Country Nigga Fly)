Country nigga fly, country nigga fly, country nigga fly
Country nigga fly, country nigga fly, country nigga fly
That country nigga fly, that country nigga fly
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
I'm a boss hoe riding hazel like a duke boy
Making neck jerk like a new boy
Erry summer, I'm pulling out a new toy
Erry winter, I'm pulling out a new toy
I love the noochies, but my old school is better
My paint dripping wet, my inside dripping leather
With a hood rich been hood since I met her
Name tattered on her pussy and I'm licking her a letter
Errytime you see me you know I'm so clean on em
Cause I ball on another level, whole team on it
I used to cook it up and break it down, triple bean on them
Fliest thing you've ever seen around, no wings on him
I'm a strip club veteran, better than you done ever been
Louie knapsack, full of racks and stacks when I'm coming in
Let me hit tonight, let me hit tonight
King of diamonds, magic city, let me hit tonight
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly (fly), that country nigga fly (fly)
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
I can't help it, I was born in this lame state
I get it in, from the lou up to the great lakes
My great estate, got beef gates
Eating dinner off my money, call it paper plates
Now what you know about that?
Now what you know about that?
I pull up, they say where you go and cop that
Tell them goodbye, not too far from my rack
Back on the leer, with a chick from Niger
Blowing Amsterdam kush while she biting on my ear
I'm in my nine's mode, feeling so sincere
I ain't playing with you niggas, I'm just tryina make it clear
I get it in, when I step out
Pull up that Benz and pull the billy out
I'm who your friends, is talk about
If you ain't with it, lil mama you missing out
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly (fly), that country nigga fly (fly)
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
Missouri to Indiana, country niggas fly
Louisiana to Alabama, them country niggas fly
Texas, Florida, Georgia, them country niggas fly
Tennessee to Carolina, them country niggas fly
Let's get it, I tell you once, I tell you twice
G's in my griss, sugar on my rice
First niggas rocking grills with the ice
Now every country motherf*cker think the leg not
East coast bitches call me mac daddy
But west coast wanna see my cat daddy
I swing a mean hook, I think I'll need a Caddy
If I was Tyga I'da never got married mane
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly (fly), that country nigga fly (fly)
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
Ain't no doubt, I show up, show out
Cause I'm country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly (fly)
Country nigga fly (fly), country nigga fly
All I know is everywhere I go
They say that country nigga fly (fly), that country nigga fly (fly)
That country, country, country, country nigga fly
Let's get it!
