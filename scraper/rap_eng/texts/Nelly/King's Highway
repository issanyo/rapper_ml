Ugh Yeah You should really turn this up
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
As loud as possible (that's what I'm talkin about, gon shine my shit up)
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (yeah)
Ask em' Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (yeah)
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (St. Louis shake it)

[Verse 1]
Come on with it
It's me and my derrty we just got back home
In the blue grey Bentley with the cellular phone
Callin' up the 'Tics (you know) it's time to get it jumpin'
Smoke comin' out the sunroof to let you know we're comin'
Everybody looking if you're jealous turn around
21 inches keep me further from the ground
I'm gettin good grip from the Dunlop Tires
The F1's bumpin' but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum Basement Beats hits son
Jay-E and Wally got it knocking (you wanna) dirty get some
I heard them haters talkin' but what am I to do?
I'm the man they love to hate the Bill Clinton of the Lou
Picked up some shorties on Skinker towards Wellston
Headed for the Castle lot moscato got me croachin
Bently kinda crowded the whole car was leanin' back
Shandra watchin' TV with two gurlies on their lap (man)
Martin Luther King the set is kind of dead
Made a left on Kingshighway Natural Bridge is just ahead
So fresh and so clean U City representin'
The St Lunatics on that Castle lot set

[Hook]
(Tell it) Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (uhh uhh)
We gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it fuck
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Come on with it
Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Basement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Come on with it

[Verse 2]
Now rollin' with the 'Tics you know we never bored
Show me another clique when more points scored
We walk around with criminals a bunch of big gorillas
My dirty Murphy Lee he's a teenage lady killer
Kyjuan is on my left side dancin' with this freak
The way she clap that ass make my knees get weak
JD is the white guy people think he's funny
Been down long time way before we had the money
But now we collectin' dollars from platinum to white gold
Swervin' in this Bentley and ain't got no place to go
Rollin' past Fairground what's up to the thugs
Shorties in their mini's wanna show a nigga love
But the dope man got em and they butts just drop
Shorties looked depressed cause that thing gon' stop
Headed back toward Union bust a Uie what the hell
Somebody shoutin' Nelly we're damn near out of L's
Baby girl blew me a kiss said "you're number one"
Then looked over to me and I ain't gon tell you what she done
The closer we get the woozier I feel
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway somebody take the wheel

[Hook]
Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (St. Louis)
Basement beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (dirty)
Come on with it
Where you headed? (uhh)
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Basement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Come on with it

[Verse 3]
Rolling Natural Bridge and we bumped in the store
Mobbing with the 'Tics is the only way to go
Four shorties by McDonald's was looking for a ride
We in the wide body so it's plenty room inside
We put two by the trunk, one on the hood
One on my lap, don't it feel good
Posse's getting deeper, we still looking for freaks
Ain't worried about them tripping cuz three got that heat
Now them shorties getting hungry and Jackie Frost treating
We stopped at Burger King for some royalty eating
But Burger King was closed, the girls started to hassle
Said "man, go back the other way I want some White Castle"
Now this is the place where the dubs hang out
The new shits is cool but old schools get the clout
Posse's so damn big what the fuck you want to do
I'm getting dirty looks from those other rapper crews
Ali dropped a hundred, I tripped off what he done
Now should I pick it up? No, drop another one
Some nigga started tripping cuz his girl was in my face
I told Big B to chill cuz he ain't worth the case
And I ain't with the smacking and beating up on your girl
If your Pimp Juice is low, then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us (us) I seen him on the bus (bus)
He beating on the window and it damn near about to bust (man)
I got a tight clique, you got a bunch of dudes
Now you're broke cold crying them St. Louis Blues
We rolled off with your girl and now you all upset
She with that Country Grammer boy and them St. Lunatics (uhh)

[Hook]
(Check it) Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (uhh uhh)
Basement beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway
Come on with it
(Tell me) Where you headed?
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway (listen to me)
Basement Beats gon' make it knock, 'Tics gon' make it rock
