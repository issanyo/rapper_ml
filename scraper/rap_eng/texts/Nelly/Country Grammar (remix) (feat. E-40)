Hmmmmm
I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound

Mmmmm, you can find me, in St. Louis rollin on dubs
Smokin on dubs in clubs, blowin up like cocoa puffs
Sippin Bud, gettin perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainted - while I'm entertainin
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin
I hang with Hannibal Lector (HOT SHIT!) so feel me when I bring
It
Sing it loud (what?) I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile - for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame, and the glamour
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic it's ironic, slammin niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

I'm goin down down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover (c'mon)
Street sweeper baby, cocked ready to let it go (HOT SHIT!)
Shimmy shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga

Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown nigga
Pound niggas, what you be givin when I'm around nigga
Frown niggas, talkin shit when I leave the town nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
Hey I'm, ready to cut you up any day now
Play by, my rules Boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo' Third Question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma
From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town
K.C. Motown to Alabama
L-A, New York Yankee niggas to Hotlanta

Smokin blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill' like I'm Hammer

Foes I kick em freely mon, 'specially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon - holla at Beenie Man

Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
Wit nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life niggas
Trife niggas, who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga

From broke to havin dough, cause my price Range is Rover
Now I'm knockin like Jehovah - let me in now, let me in now

Spin now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10"s now

Seein now, through the pen I make my ends now
