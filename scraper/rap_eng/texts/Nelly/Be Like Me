When I grow up I wanna be just like you!
[Ms. Toi]
No you don't believe me you don't

[Verse 1: Ms. Toi]
Yes a fly chick come in a whip let me see ya sit
Me and Nelly holdin it down bout to freak the shit
Hearin me spit so you can ask me who I sound like
But I don't care what you process-e you vocals is tight
Yeah it's me yeah Ms. T in the place to be
Hearin my name bang now you wanna connect with me
I don't wanna be like nobody but me life lady see
Can't nobody do it better than me
So if I look like sound like clown like
Lets cut to the chase do you see this serious look on my face
This music is a taste given you a little snip
Cause the whole wide world ain't heard shit
So let me be quick to sit you down in your place
And tell you right to your face
Sista, you ain't nothin but a faker, a playa hata

[Chorus 1: Ms. Toi and Murphy Lee]
Go and tell that girl Ms. Toi what you wanna be

[Verse 2: Nelly]
So you wanna be a Midwest Hippie off the banks of the Mississippi
Your chances winnin are iffy slim or pretty
Give ya *1* like *Penny* if you want it the hard way
Who that is dirty comin right down Broadway?
Herre the champagne, platnium and wood frames
Wood grain all up in the hummers and the mustangs
Code name Nelly got messages on the tele
By Lisa, Tomika, Angela, Rachel, and Sister Shelly
Oh really, you say some of these names might ring a belly
Ain't no tellin Cuda school eh! night schoolin Nelly
Come herre ho (Come herre ho)
Herre I go (Well herre I go)
Alcohol get you horny and freaky then drink some more
P.O. trippin bout a nigga takin drug inhancements
Askin me if I been smokin while my ? readin Branson

Just caught a ride wit four niggas that I met at the bar
Now tell me

[Chorus 2: Ms. Toi and Murphy Lee]
Go and tell that girl Ms. Toi what you wanna be
Go and this stylin chick who you wanna be
Go and tell ya royal hynis what you wanna be
See baby girl I wanna be like me

Go on and tell a Lunatic who you wanna be

I wanna be like me

[Verse 3: Ms. Toi]
This a sick flick with another hit again
We usin our names while we rockin this thang mayne
So if you came in wit which would never happen
You respectin my game I'm doin this shit rapid
Now we handclappin stackin papers for Ali
Just cuz I'm doin it right you wanna be like me?
Just take a bag of doin thangs and grab a hustler and put yo name on it
And maybe you'll respect yourself in the mornin young pimpin

[Verse 3: Ali]

No you don't (Why not?)
Let me tell ya (Tell me then, tell me then, tell me then)
What the fuck you don't wanna be is like that nigga Ali
Strugglin, strapped quick to put your brain on your lap
Now think about that how I come through bump you
Skull cap I'll fuck you laugh at you find a place that I can dump you
Hump hump you, underground won't even confront you
Just slump you laugh body bag now I gotta trunk you yeah

[Chorus 2 2x w/ adlibs]

Go and tell that girl Ms. Toi what you wanna be
Go and this stylin chick who you wanna be
Go and tell ya royal hynis what you wanna be
