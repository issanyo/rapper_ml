[Lyrics from Snippet]

I can't do, without you, without you
Ah nah, baby I'm so gone
Girl I think I'm falling, and I don't wanna get up
And even if I'm dreaming, I don't wanna wake up
Tell me can I have you baby
365 oh yeah
Cause every time we touch, I be in a trance
I just wanna do it again

Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?
Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?
Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?
Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?
Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?
Ah, baby can we do it again, ah baby can we do it again?

Would that be wrong if I asked for one more
If I say ... would you say oh oh
Cool like ice tea, she hot like choco
Shawty got a ... perfect frame like photo
So, you make me wanna do it again
Wake up in the morning, yeah, do it again
Swing by your job and lunch break you in
And let you know what you gonna get when you get home
Baby we can leave the lights on, if you wanna
Make our own movie on your phone, if you wanna
How bout one more time for the road, if you wanna
You wanna, you wanna, yeah, yeah, you wanna
It ain't no secret Shawty, you're the one I'm falling for
Late night flight, you're the one I'm calling on
