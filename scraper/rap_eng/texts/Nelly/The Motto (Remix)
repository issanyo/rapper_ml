Ayeeeee; get low
Baby get low
From the north side, so I hit the north side walk
U. City, wake up pretty
No curtains in the condo, sun on your titty
Auto pilot; that's how you like to ride it
Danger got you growling, baby please don't bite it
Just breathe; please don't fight it
Got sex in the urrr; girl go on head and fly it
New drink, I'm off of that twop
Got 50 on the World Series, show me what you got
I bet big
Bet a whole lot, got money on the table;
Las Vegas, Nevada
C-note, one time if you got a c-note
Yeah I’m coaching this shit like Rick Pitino
Beat the pussy up then I drink a peregrino
Cameras in my room so I get hella TiVo
Hey...you love this shit, we know
Comeback kid, similar to Tim Tebow
Country all damn day, rep your hometown baby north side east saint
...Louis...all day long
If it ain’t broke, then it ain't wrong
Real nigga; wassup!
O-E, MO, 12-24
