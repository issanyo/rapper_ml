Up in your curch, love that you bring
Way that you move, you overdue for a raise
Get it, I get it, I ain't takin no breaks
Hustle, I do it, girl I been up for some days
Drink like a phony, smoke like a kitsch
Money on top, I do this shit for commission
If I break the room, eatin em outta
Before the line over I'm elevatin the ladder
You see your red bottom's hot
You know right away
Yea you know how to get it
Let me see if you know how to shake
See that money's ignited, so come on get on it
Only way you can get it is to see where it's going...
One more kill I'll see
I'm swopping out, taken off
One more kill I'll see
We own the night, we coming off
We up on the couches yelling out
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!
All on the tables yelling out
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!
Up on the bar they yelling out aye
Don't turn it down, I'm turned up
That kush loud, that where we burning love
No clubs mama, bottles to the head
You can drown me if you want and get a bottle to his head
I do it, I do it, I get it if I want it
The way shorty movin, go ahead and bag it up on me
Yea her body's official, keep keep do what you doin
And you and your girlfriend are open, both of ya'll come get to it
And ya'll gon drop that booty (aye aye baby go)
Drop it for real, drop it however you feel (come on)
Gon drop that booty (aye aye baby go)
Drop it for real, drop it however you feel (come on)
One more kill I'll see
I'm swopping out, taken off
One more kill I'll see
We own the night, we coming off
We up on the couches yelling out
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!
All on the tables yelling out
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye!
Up on the bar they yelling out aye
