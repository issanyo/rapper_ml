[Intro]
St. Louis! {echo}
Stomp stomp stomp stomp {repeated}
This house belongs to who

[Hook]
Not in my house
You might catch me on the road
But not in my house
It won't happen oh no (oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)
Not in my house (check me out)
You might catch me on the road
But not in my house
It won't happen oh no (oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no)

[Verse 1]
Check it, check it
Now we've come along way ay (hear me out)
And I know you wanna go some more oh
The only thing keeping you from completin your mission derrty
Is makin it past my door
See I'd hate to be the bearer of bad news
But I simply gotta tell ya I refuse to lose
To continue how you wanna disrespect intended
But it ain't goin down hell nah derrty

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Check it, check it
I dropped my mug in the dirt done, you done crossed this line
Me losin tonight, ain't even cross my mind
This my house, and I'm a defend it crush you if need be
Leaving you as an example for other teams to see
It can be, 2 strikes, 2 outs, no lights
Fourth down, fourth quarter, lookin at a baby order
Fourth period, minute left, down ten, hold ya breath
Pick and roll, back door, game over, told ya so

[Hook]

Not in my house {4x}
