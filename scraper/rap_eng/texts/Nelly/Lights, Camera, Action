(Donnie) Hey girl, do you love me?
(Girl) Yes
(Donnie) Well, I wanna try something with you
So, don't be shy
Are you ready?
(Girl) Of course, baby
(Donnie) Let's go

Chorus:
You go hit the lights, I'll set up the camera
Let's get to the action
You go hit the lights, I'll set up the camera
Let's get to the action

I've been thinking about this for some time
I got a freaky temptation burnin' deep inside

You say the strip's already rolling
And the bedroom is the set
I hope you know your lines 'cause one take is all we get

Chorus

By the time this over, girl, I'm-a make you a star
You ready? (1,2,3,4)

I'm the directing and producing
And you're the leading lady of my show
(You're the leading lady, baby)
No body double needed, cause I do all the stunts on my own

Believe that you can turn your phone off
But be quiet on the set
You better know your lines 'cause one take is all we get

Chorus 2x

We gonna rewind, go one more time
And playback our love on the wide screen
Baby, don't stop until I say cut
Cause our camera's on, keep it rolling, rolling...
