[Verse 1]
Uh, I falls through in a Hummer, Murphy the Don, Lizzie, Kyjuan
With the best thunder than Sean John, you don't want none
Partner, I got a rep for leaving heads swollen up
On top of all that, I got the rap sewed up
Hold up, with the budda thumpin' niggas quota
And just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder
I told ya, 'Tics live for the street life
Eat right, fuck good, and reefer thru the Pipe
I'm gettin' head all night, and if it's some beef
I pumpin' lead on sight until they deceased
I took ya head off right, I live in the Beast
Nigga, where the feds, play Sheist, I still floss ice
Keep it tight errtime, call me the Black
Liberace when I'm playing mine, that's how I flow
I gotta get mine, partner, any way it go
Whether it be rapping or with the 4-4

[Chorus]
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

[Verse 2]
My nigga, I can make a million blind-folded, with no shows
Using no flows, just Arm-n-Hammer and four O's
Gimmie low-do's and a connect, that is never closed
And watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos
Fuck some Mo-Mo's, gimme hundred spokes, all chrome
On the Navigata equipped to click and log on
I leave that, before its gone 'fore they even bring it home
Matter of fact, I'll tell you whats in the back, its all gone
Two holes in the roof, to let the sun come in
Match it leather car seat, in case my son get in
I spare one off in the back in case he brings his friend
PlayStation just in case a nigga think he can win

[Chorus]
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

[Verse 3]
I say now, tho yo wrappers off in the air
But only if the ice on your wrist cause glurrs, I'm gettin'
Stares from dime bitches, is he alone, where's his Mrs
1-2-3-4-5 bottles of Cris's
On the Table, arms the strong rip off the Label
No more shows for free, I'm pay-per-view like Cable
They all screamin' my name, different shades and race
Take them all backstage and let 'em plead they case
Make a million like Jigga, standin' in one place
Sound Scan like Thrilla without changin' my face
They threw a weak plan B says who? (Says Mase)
Then what's plan A 'cause plan B about papes

[Chorus]
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough
Let's make a million, keep it real for Triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes, I gotta get rich, go
Platinum and do shows and get the dough

[Post-Chorus]
I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

[Outro]
All my Midwest niggas tryna make a mill
Tho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)
All my Dirty South niggas tryna make a mill
Tho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)
All my West Coast niggas tryna make a mill
Tho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)
All my East Coast niggas tryna make a mill
Tho dem wrappas (and the Dough-O)
