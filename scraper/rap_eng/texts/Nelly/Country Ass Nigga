[Intro]
You know what I found out?
Sometimes no matter what you do, they only look at you one way
At the end of the day

[Hook: Nelly]
Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Call me Mr. All That
All that
E'rything you have, I'm all that
Call me wack
You better call back
(Crawl back)
Or fall back before that black mack, bust all that
Old schoolin' that new thing
White V-neck with two chains
Like 2 Chainz, I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it
This is mine, I'mma spend it
If she's fine, I'll hit it right mayne
You hear that beat, that's Drumma Boy
When I see you, that's trouble, boy
Say the word and I'm in thurr
Name the time, and that when/where
I'ma two piece ya like swimwear

Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Rubber bands on my cheddar knots
Cause I'm super cool and I'm hella hot
A broad, a menage, I'mma let her eye
While I'm barrelin' out, and I'm yelling out
Fuck you, bitch, I'm so stupid
I love no ho, ain't no Cupid
King of the south, thought you knew this
I screw her mouth then throw deuces
I'm wit' Nelly and 2 Chainz, and 2 Chainz give two shits
I'm A-Town, I'm West Side, Bankhead, Shawty I'm foolish
Old school car, new chick, don't lose your ho when I ride, fool
These millions don't mean shit, I was the man when I was in high school
All about survival where I come from
Young and dumb, Bible all a nigga run from
Ignorant
Belligerent
Can't wait to get a quarter key and get to gettin' it

[Hook: Nelly]
Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm a country nigga, and I keep it street
All I smoke is strong
Straight section eight
I got socks on with my house shoes
I got my baby mama name tattooed
I got another bitch with another bitch
Mad cause I fucked up her hairdo (damn)
Hair weave killa
On a "wanted" poster
Dance on a white girl
Call it John Travolta
I'm a country nigga, I fuck her on the sofa
My whip white with the black top like Sammy Sosa
If you ain't got no money
You better have hustle
See when I got some money
All I did was add muscle
Tity 2 Chainz, and the two's never too much
Extension cord is when you put together 2 blunts

[Hook: Nelly]
Take away the money
Take away the fame
Strip me to my drawers
And you still gon' find the same old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga

Way before the house
Way before the cars
I was pullin' broads
And I still was gettin' called old
Country Azz Nigga
Country Azz Nigga
