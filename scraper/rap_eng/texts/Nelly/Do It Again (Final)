If we do it one time
We gonna do it two times
And then three times
And then four times
And then we rewind
And do it one more time
Lets do it again
Lets do it again

[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Baby, lately I’ve been thinkin’ bout you
And it’s drivin’ me crazy
‘Cause I just wanna give you all this lovin'
And I hate it
When I have to wait
Oh baby I’m tryna be patient
But my heart is in a rush

I want you
And I need you
Right now, baby right now
I can’t do
Without you
Right now, baby I’m so gone
Girl I

[Hook]
Girl I think I’m fallin
And I don’t wanna get up
And even if I’m dreamin’
I don’t wanna wake up
Tell me can I have you baby
Three sixty five oh yeah
‘Cause everytime we touch
I be in a trance
And I just wanna do it again

Oh baby can we do it again (x8)

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
When I wake up
The first thing that I wanna do is see your face girl
Oo you be lookin’ so good
Don’t need no make up
And everytime you go away I want you to stay girl
Right here girl

‘Cause I want you
And I need you
Right now, baby right now
I can’t do
Without you
Right now, baby I’m so gone
Girl I

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Nelly]
Would I be wrong if I asked for one more
If I say E, I, would you say oh, oh
Cool like ice tea
Hot like cocoa
Shawty got a picture perfect frame like photo
So, you make me wanna do it again
Wake up in the mornin’, yeah do it again
Swing by your driveway let me break you in
And let you know what you gon get when you get home
Baby we can leave the lights on, (if you wanna)
Make our own movie on your phone, (if you wanna)
How bout one more time for the road, (if you wanna, yeah, yeah you wanna)
It ain’t no secret shawty you the one I’m fallin’ for
Late night flight you the one I’m callin’ on
Ain’t no comparison she’s something that I’ve never known
Something that I’ve never known, no, no

[Hook]
