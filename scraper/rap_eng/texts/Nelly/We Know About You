[Intro: A1]
Right now sound
Right now

[Verse 1: A1]
These things that you just do
Things that you say
Girl I play the fool while you fucked with my head
But you know, girl it's cool (cool)
I'm good either way (way)
Girl keep all the shoes
And the shit that I paid
Ain't no more

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go
(We know about you)
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go
(We know about you)
Yeah

[Verse 2: A1]
Right now
Tryna catch flights overseas, uh huh
Fuck around with the enemy, uh huh
I was tryna live in fuckin' peace, uh huh
You got double standards
Can't trust a bitch with no manners
Walk around like you mad or some'
Must think that you bad or something

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go
(We know about you)
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
I can't believe everything that I hear
But it's all when they talk about you
Sitting blow an L at the L
And I'm thinkin' to myself what the fuck I'm gon' do
I'm the one that keep the pussy in line
I can be the only nigga in line
Yeah, that pussy good, girl I can't lie
Yeah, that pussy good, girl I can't lie
Actin' like you don't when you do (when you do)
Like I didn't know when I knew (when I knew)
Shawty go down like the Titanic (Titanic)
Shawty got body's in the Atlantic (hey)

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go
(We know about you)
Just another hoe
(We know about you)
Gotta let you go
(We know about you)

[Outro: Nelly, A1 & Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah

You can keep the bands in the bag Ma'
Don't forget your heels in the truck Ma'
We know about you
