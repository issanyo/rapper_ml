I just wanna live my life, babe
Hey Vegas, Miami, Hey London, Toronto, Hey Paris!
I just wanna live my life, babe!

Top down there's a road down the back street
Shot gun with a twin in the back seat
No one with them two, it's just me
Pull up to the club like a Pimp c
Shouts out to the playas in the V.I.P
Hey D.J., yeah, you remember me?
Its the Nigga with the same group from the last week
And we be, and we be
Popping bottles, making noise
On the tables, on the bars
Shooting game at every broad
Tell the girls to freak them boys
I feel the patron and the re shots
I'm throwin hundred dollar raindrops
I live it up yo it may not , it may not cause today....

Chorus:
I just wanna liv tonight!
I just wanna liv tonight away!
I just wanna liv tonight!
I just wanna liv my life, babe!
New York, L.A., Chicago, V.A., Saint Louis!
I just wanna live my life, babe
Hey Vegas, Miami, Hey London, Toronto, Hey Paris!
I just wanna live my life, babe!
