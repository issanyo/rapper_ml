[JAKE, RYDER & SAM]
Hot in, so hot in here!
So hot in, oh!

[JAKE (THE CHEERIOS)]
With a little bit of (Ah, ah)
And a little bit of (Ah, ah)
Just a little bit of (Ah, ah)
Just a little bit of (Ah, ah)

[SAM (JAKE & RYDER)]
I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious, (ah!)
Flirtatious, trying to show patience (ah!)
Waiting for the right time to shoot my steez (you know)
Looking for the right time to flash them Gs (then uh!)
I'm leaving, please believe in (oh!)
Me and the rest of my heathens
Check it, got it locked at the top of the Fo' Seasons
Penthouse, roof top, birds I'm feeding

[RYDER]
Years go by I'm lookin'
Through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

[JAKE (SAM)]
It's getting hot in here, (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes (Eh!)

[RYDER with THE CHEERIOS]
Angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

[JAKE (SAM)]
It's getting hot in here, (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes, (Eh!)

[RYDER with THE CHEERIOS]
Angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

[THE CHEERIOS (JAKE)]
Mix a little bit of Ah, ah
With a little bit of Ah, ah (Let it just fall out)
Give a little bit of Ah, ah
With a little bit of Ah, ah (Let it all hang out)

[SAM (JAKE & RYDER)]
Why you at the bar if you ain't popping the bottles? c'mon
What good is all the fame if you ain't bumping the models
I see you driving sports cars, ain't hitting the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Get off the freeway, exit 106 and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause, baby, I can't talk it

[RYDER]
Warm and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

[JAKE (SAM)]
It's getting hot in here, (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes (Eh!)

[RYDER with THE CHEERIOS]
Angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

[JAKE (SAM)]
It's getting hot in here, (So hot!)
So take off all your clothes, (Eh!)

[RYDER with THE CHEERIOS]
Angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold

[JAKE]

Give a little bit of (Ah, ah)
With a little bit of (Ah, ah)

[JAKE]

With a little bit of (Ah, ah)
And a sprinkle of that (Ah, ah)

[JAKE]
Let it just fall out

[JAKE with THE CHEERIOS (THE CHEERIOS)]
I like it when ya (Ah, ah)
Girl, Baby make it (Ah, Ah)
