Yo, I wanna explain somethin to all the, squares out there
Uhh, they may not know what 24, woodgrain and leather with a hole is
24 inches or twenty-four inch rims in diameter
Woodgrain is the type of material that goes like on the dashboard or your doors
Leather is like your seats
And the hole is what they call a sunroof
Or maybe a three-way power hole
