Hey lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothing like you
Hey lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

[Verse 1]
Girl letâ€™s go!
You sexy thing, you turn me on
I need a private show, here on the lawn, in my garage
I take you on the road, hey Porsche girl
You know what I wanna do (wanna do)
Come on let me slide under so I can work on, work on you

[Pre-Hook]
I wanna take your top off, celebrate this champagne pop-off
Yeah, we could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don't need nobody's permission
No keys, push start to ignition, say

Girl you know
Damn I've been dreaming about the day you let me take you home
Just for a week and maybe more
Just say it, say I've never seen an ass like that
You gon' make a nigga crash like that
Since I seen you in the window, knew what I was in for
Spending every rack on that

[Pre-Hook]

See how you handle as I'm losing control
As I make you turn around
Hey, let me turn up your sun
T-t-turn it up and now here we go
