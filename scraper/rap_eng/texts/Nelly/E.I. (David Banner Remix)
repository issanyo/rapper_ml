[Hook]
Said it must be ya ass cause it ain't ya face
I need a tipdrill, I need a tipdrill
I said it must be ya ass cause it ain't ya face

Point her out, where she at?
Point her out, there she goes!
Said if ya see a tipdrill point her out, where she at
Point her out, where she at?
Point her out, there she goes!

[Verse 1]
I'ma sucka for corn rows and manicured toes (hey!)
And Applebottom capri's and Parasuco's (alright!)
High saddity or city, with one or two clothes
I'm draftin 'em out of highschool straight into the pros
Who knows, I knows (eh!)
I love it when you be makin' your knees touch your elbows
Takin' it down low
To the flo', and there you go
Now throw it on me slow
And err'ytime I +Busta Rhyme+, baby "Gimme Some Mo"
You say you likin' that
When I be hittin' it from behind and I be rightin' back
Ye that's my very next line
I use it time after time when I be speakin' my mind
I spit the same game to a pigeon or fine dime
(eh!) Talkin that shit about the 'Tics
Somebody pro'lly jealous cause they bitch got hit
But ain't nobody else talking shit like this
Should we apologize? (Hell nah! Hell nah!)

[Hook]
We be like andale, andale, mami E.I. E.I. (oh oooooh!)
What's poppin' tonight?
Andale, andale, mami E.I. E.I. (oh ooooooh!)
Well if the head right, I be there err'ynight
Andale, andale, mami E.I. E.I. (oh oooooh!)
What's poppin' tonight?
Andale, Andale, mami E.I. E.I. (oh ooooooh!)
Well if the head right, I be there err'ynight

[Verse 2]
'Til the break of dawn (dawn)
You see our money long (long)
Matter fact I'm takin' the skirt right along with the thong (thong)
Some say I'm wrong, but fuck it I'm grown (grown)
I'm about 20-somethin' with 2 of my own'
Nigga I flash it (oh!)
Double takes when you past me, nasty
Don't be scared boo, come on just ask me
I drive fastly I'm like Jeff Gordon
I switch the raid on the S and kept that Navigation
System cranked, blaze'on
It's smellin' amaze'on
Got three chicks rollin' out black, white and Asian
Another one pigeon tellin me to come home
He jus left the house and he ain't comin back home
I use the V-12 powers, I be there in an hour
Matter fact, you keep the door open I'll catch you in the shower
Bring it back over girl, I hear you gettin' louder
And the same shit gon' happen  if you use the word ours yeah!

[Hook]

[Intro]

[Verse 3]
We runnin' through a whole pound - of that sticky
Hydro got my whole mouth - feelin' icky
I pour Crissy down a ho's mouth - just cause she picked me
Back stage when my show's out - tell em what you mean
I mean four inches when we roll out - come and get me
Rock the platinum and brought the gold out - who all wit' me?
I already got my fo' out - cocked
Plus I got many niggas wanna show out!
In the Escalade
(you know) Powder baby blue leather seats Gucci
And Jack Frosty
Roger the Rabbit and Bugsy
Go back like there no socks in rugby
If you compare me to any other MC on originality
For s'all in the jewelry
I gotta be top three
I gotta be cocky
If you ready to leave Holly, see you in Maui

[Hook]

Eh! eh! eh! (oh oooh!) eh! eh! eh! eh!
Uh! uh! uh! uh! Well if the head right, I be there err'ynight!
Eh! ye!
