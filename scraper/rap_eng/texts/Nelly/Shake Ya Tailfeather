We do it for fun
We just do it for fun
Dirty E.N.T

We do it for fun (this is history baby)

Bend them trucks, we do it for fun (haha)
Stack them bucks, we do it for fun (come on now)

If you see me ma, we do it for fun

Bad Boys II, the soundtrack
Let's go

Come here girl, what your name is?
Where you from? Turn around, Who you came with?
Is that your ass or your mama have reindeer?
I can't explain it but damn sure glad you came here

I'm still a sucker for cornrows, you know I never changed that (nah uh)
Your body is banging mama, but where your brains at? (come on)
I'm still the same cat when I was young I was running with bad boys
But now I'm older hope they saw I'm running with bad boys (that's right)

Here come another man unlike no other man
Candy coated, whoa, switching every other lane
Y'all help me, why don't cha? Please help me
Eighth girl this week and it's only Tuesday

I like the cocky bow legged ones
Like white and Dominicans
Hispanics and Asians
Shake it for Nelly son
Manolos Ma-no-no's I can't tell
Everybody and their hoochies
When you do it, do it well

Let me see you take it
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tailfeather

Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tailfeather

Now real girls get down on the floor (on the floor)
Now get that money, honey, act like you know (like you know)
Mama, I like how you dance, the way you fit in them pants (uh)
Enter the floor (uh) take it low (uh) girl do it again (uh)

You know I love that (I love that)
Now where them girls at? (Where the girls at?)
It's Diddy, Murphy Lee and Nelly, how you love that? (Shit, uh oh)
Come on, we got another one player
From New York to the Dirty, how they loving it player?

Baby, you impressive, let's get to know each other
You the best of the best and you gotta love it
In the dresses, the sexiest, I had to tell her
She's a young Janet Jackson live in living color

Look here mama, you're dead wrong for having them pants on
Capris cut low so when you shake it I see your thong
My pocket's full of dough, shake your feathers till the morning
It's Bad Boy and Nelly man, somebody better warn 'em

Let me see you take it
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go

Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tailfeather

Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running (yeah)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song stop, fuck it, because my mic still on

Yo, I'm the big booty type
I like them thick with their mind right (aww)
Banging personality, conversate when the time right (naw)
I'm not hard, I've got women to handle that
They be like, "He the man!" when I'm really a ThunderCat

Come on, you know the tics connect like Voltron
Collect so much grass, popo thinking we mow lawns
My gohans don't match that
But it matches her head wrap and the seats that I got in the 'Lac

I'm just a juvenile (wha) cause I be about G's
Keep your women wizzy man, they say they have my babies
I'm young like turk, I like the cash and the money
(I'm going to eat my money) Man, I'm that damn hungry

See I'm starvin' like Marvin girl
I've got sixteen bars of fire is what I'm starting
Plus my rats come in packs like Sammy and Dean Martin
And I got so many keys you'd think I'm valet parking

Let me see you take it
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow
We can even do it slow
Take it where you want to go
Take it where you want to go
Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tailfeather

Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow

Oh no, I heard them bad boys coming
Can't stop now, got to continue my running (yeah)
'Cause we go party till them lights come on
And then my song stop, fuck it, because my mic still on (man)

Go slow
Go to the floor
Let me see you shake ya tailfeather

Let me see you take it
Girl, go and take it off
We can even do it slow

Just take that ass to the floor
Pop something move something
Shake ya tailfeather
