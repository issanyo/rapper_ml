[Intro: The Teamsters]
Yeah, gangsta
What, that gangsta
Yeah, that gangsta
Lunatics, E.I

[Verse 1: The Teamsters]
I was forced to live in a crazy life
Y'all niggas don't understand what a day be like
Got a son, no my Pop's didn't raise me right
When Hennedy don't pay me right, no baby wipes
Grip the 3-80 tight Mercedes-like
On a shady night y'all niggas is ladylike
Roll with niggas that'll watch your arm
Run in your crib pop your mom
Like 'bitch where the stocks and bonds?'
In the studio a thug wanna lock your calm
Tell a nigga I'm like flex I drop the bomb
You come to war with a switchblade, get laid
Nigga I'ma spit the gauge at your rib cage
We thugged out, y'all niggas is bitch made
You pick Jay they North white the shit grade
Your customers mad ready to let the clips spray
Out of a week I stay in a lab for 6 days

[Chorus: The Teamsters]
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

[Verse 2: Teamsters]
I'm second to none nigga, yo this is lead in my gun
Pull this trigger shit off the window through the head of your son
I've been runnin' like 20 miles, I ain't sweatin' for fun
Yo it's hard to be a team when the second is one
'Cause I follow very, wanna wife like Halle Berry
Yeah I ain't tryna be locked up under consolitary
How you gon' stop a nigga unstoppable?
How you gon' pop a nigga that pop for you?
Hushed out in the drop top, aqua blue
Get the bitch screamin', "please, please, not my boo"
My revolver shook like I deal with smart crook
You know the name, switch up the game like Garth Brooks
Like ten cars from Tahoe's to Windstars
I been hard through hell better sing God
Diminish, I'm a bulldog, breathing British
You ain't psycho 'cause you're nice, it is all about your image

[Chorus: The Teamsters]
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

[Verse 3: Nelly]
What, sitting on the bricks of the river front in Cutlasses
Check the ashtray that hold the blunts, we hustling
I do the push ups and the sit ups nigga, get muscular
Just in case you let your lips slip up, I'm bustin' ya
Never let em see you sweat, yeah, that's my motto
Catch 'em in the club get wrecked with the bottle
The silence all behind his neck, the others follow
Show them you ain't bullshittin' and you ain't hollow
I saw you talkin' to that chick up over there
I heard you ask her why she is on my dick, yeah, yeah
I heard it all before you dig, next thing you tellin' me Nelly
I put that on my fuckin' kid, what you think this is?
I'm the reason they invented the whole navigational system
So niggas can't find them trucks and they women when I'm with 'em
Like I catch 'em in linen and then I flip 'em and run up in 'em
Send her back to him and go to his house and blow him with her

[Chorus: The Teamsters]
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat
I brought my Right Guard in case my shot ain't handy
Speed stickin' me and mine
If I turn it up a degree, the secret's still kept
Never let 'em see you sweat

[Outro: The Teamsters]
Never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em see you sweat
Never let 'em
Never let 'em
To play this shit out nigga
How nigga
