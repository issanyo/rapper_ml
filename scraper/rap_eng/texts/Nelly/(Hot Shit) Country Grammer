Hmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin' down, down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Mmm, you can find me in St. Louis rollin' on dubs
Smokin' on dubs in clubs, blowin' up like cocoa puffs
Sippin' Bud, gettin' perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because, 'ccumulated enough stretch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome

And it's candy painted, fans fainted, while I'm entertainin'
Wild ain't it? How me and money end up hangin'
I hang with Hannibal Lector, so feel me when I bring it
(Hot shit)
Sing it loud, I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
(What?)

Run a mile for the 'cuz I'm righteous above the law
Playa my style's raw, I'm "Born to Mack" like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamor
Give me D's wit a rubber hammer
My grammar be's ebonics, gin tonic and chronic
Fuck bionic, it's ironic, slammin' niggas like Onyx
Lunatics til' the day I die
I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

Hmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot shit)
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

I'm goin' down, down baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Who say pretty boys can't be wild niggas?
Loud niggas, O.K. Corral niggas
Foul niggas, run in the club and bust in the crowd nigga
How nigga? Ask me again and it's goin' down nigga
Now nigga, come to the circus and watch me clown nigga
Pound niggas, what you be givin' when I'm around nigga

Frown niggas, talkin' shit when I leave the town nigga
Say now, can you hoes come out to play now
Hey I'm ready to cut you up any day now
Play by my rules Boo and you gon' stay high
May I, answer yo' third question like A.I
Say hi, to my niggas left in the slamma

From St. Louis to Memphis
From Texas back up to Indiana, Chi-Town
K.C. Motown to Alabama
L.A, New York Yankee niggas to Hotlanta
'Ouisiana, all my niggas wit 'Country Grammar'
Smokin' blunts in Savannah
Blow thirty mill' like I'm Hammer

Hmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

Let's show these cats to make these millions
So you niggas quit actin' silly, mon
Kid quicker than Billy, mon
Talkin' really and I need it mon
Foes I kick 'em freely mon, 'specially off Remi, mon
Keys to my Beemer, mon, holla at Beenie Man

See me, mon, cheifin' rollin' deeper than any mon
Through Jennings mon, through U-City back up to Kingsland
Wit nice niggas, sheist niggas who snatch yo' life niggas
Trife niggas, who produce and sell the same beat twice, nigga
(Hot shit)
Ice niggas, all over close to never sober

From broke to havin' dough 'cuz my price Range is Rover
Now I'm knockin' like Jehovah, let me in now, let me in now
Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in now
Spin now, I got money to lend my friends now
We in now, candy Benz, Kenwood and 10"s now
I win now, fuckin' lesbian twins now
(Whoo)
Seein' now, through the pen I make my ends now

Hmm, I'm goin' down, down, baby, yo' street in a Range Rover
(C'mon)
Street sweeper, baby, cocked ready to let it go
(Hot Shit)
Shimmy, shimmy cocoa what? Listen to it pound
