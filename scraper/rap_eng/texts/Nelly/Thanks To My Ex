[Verse 1]
Listen
It's his bad you found a new lover
It's her fault I'm looking for another
It ain't our problem, girl
One man's trash is another man's treasure (oh)

[Refrain]
Lucky for us (oh)
See we got it all (oh)
Yeah

[Pre-Hook]
I'm glad he lied to your face
I'm glad she made those mistakes
Cause you wouldn't be here now
I wouldn't be here now
We wouldn't be here now

[Hook]
Thanks to your ex
Thanks to my ex
Thanks to your ex
Thanks to my ex
Cause you wouldn't be here now
I wouldn't be here now
We wouldn't be here now
If it wasn't for the ex

[Verse 2]
It's his bad he was out wylin'
It's her fault you can't stop smilin'
He lost your heart and I found it
It's her fault tears are drowning her

[Refrain] + [Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge]
It's his bad you found a new lover
It's his bad you found a new lover
It ain't our problem girl
One man's trash is another man's treasure
It's his bad you found a new lover

[Hook]
