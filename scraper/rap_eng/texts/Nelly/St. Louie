[Chorus]
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

[Verse 1]
I'm from the home of Red Fox, Ced the Entertainer
Jettin' off with Brian Cox, I'll see ya later
Maybe not 'cause I got somethin' hot
In the Navigator, waitin' in the parkin' lot
A Bad Boy, on a Ryde Ruff-er than The LOX
I keep 'em both cocked, Nina and Sabrina
Now tell me boys have ya seen her
Have you seen her, nine millimeter
Makin' niggas believers
Hop out the two-seater, in a Vokal wife beater
Levi's fresh from the cleaners
Heavy starch with the cuff
Like fuck it leave it to beaver
Catch me in the Galleria, Plaza of Chesterfield
Rollin' down Hanley Hills, in a black Sedan Deville
I used to love it when they hit me for a rocker
Maybe a bopper, I kept it proper
A non-stopper, around the clock-a
Now it's cool to pull up the Benz and helicopta, uh

[Chorus]
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

[Verse 2]
Sunday mornin', crack of dawn and I'm yawnin'
Natural Bridge and Kingshighway is where I'm goin'
Wake up man and start blowin'
Gotta get those juices flowin'
Now I'm gonna tell ya one more time
For you cats that just ain't knowin'
Hey, you can find me in St. Louie
In the hole with me Fetty and Leezy gettin' swoll
Grabbin the Optimo, sharpin' up my flow
Practicin' for my shows, that's usually how it goes
We be ready to go, the chronic already rolled
Swingin through O'Fallon Sounds, knockin' out of control
Like a boom boom boom, who is it? It's Jackie Frost
The one who's gettin' where he at and he showed you who was the boss
I'm like a human hot sauce
Thinkin I'll burn your thoughts
Your information was false
I'll show you just what it costs
In the M I crooked letter crooked letter O U R I
No one could do it better, hey

[Chorus]
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

[Verse 3]
Now in the middle we keep it crunk and jiggy
Love 'Pac and Biggie
The way that you love your sticky
Call Louie he have you pissy
Mix with hen and crissy
Bumpin Tim and Missy
With Slim that used to diss me
In the red Expedition
That's okay though, she can ride just for the day though
Can't even be a house guest like Kato
I'm a dog, I said it woof, woof
Now call me Snoopy
Wouldn't have me in a hooptie
Now you see me in a coupie
In front of utopia, I'm hopin' ya
Come down here chirpin', may I'm toastin' ya
Thanksgiving round these parts yo we roastin' ya
And when the heat come down
Get ghostin' ya (god bless us)
Loax with us, just how he folks with us
My daddy told me that I'm supposed to bust
Don't be provokin' us
It ain't no joke in us
Just the North, South, East, West coast, and us

[Chorus]
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day
You can find me in St. Louie
Where the gun play ring all day (nanana)
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Others just smoke and fuck all day

[Outro]
What they know 'bout the Lou, huh?
What they know 'bout the arch?
[?] Sunday night, DJ Charlie Chain
Pop that like that there, huh
Get up
Sendin' shots out to [?] and sons, haha
The arch
You can find me in St. Louie
White [?] die, my nigga
Club with a c-note, DJ 618
Some got jobs and some sell yay
Uh, my nigga [?] live for the wizards
'Cause they shit on
Larry playin' with the answer, haha
Makin' basketball go outta milk crakes
What you know about that, huh?
My nigga
Ain't nobody hoopin' like that
