[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ricky Ross, somethin' special right here
Excuse the marijuana, just tryina enjoy my self
We got some gangstas in the house too

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sight seein', we might be in
The quattroporte or the new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid
I helped her out, she had problems with financial aid
Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced, spendin' nights in Milan
We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Here I am, here I go
Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya, now ya in the big league
A black Steinbrenner, who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, "I, like to do the wild thing"
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
More better, more cheddar
Knocked ya man off the clothes line sweater
Hoe getter, gorilla
Fuck chauffeurs, I went and got more killas
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
Cause to tell the truth, life fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Cause them strapped heels aren't for amateurs
Wrist quite rocky, talk like Foxy
Job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk like Aki, that means sexy
I will save you, if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
A lot of alphabets girl I'm a G
Time will tell, Rolex watches
We show stoppers, hoes just watch us

[Hook: Avery Storm]
I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am
