You better watch who you talkin' 'bout
Runnin' yo mouth like you know me
You gonna fuck around and choke
Why the show nigga' carnies
Show me
While one on one you can't hold me if your last name was hand
Only way you wear me out is stitch my name on ya pants
No resident of France
But you swear I'm from Paris
Hundered 6 karats
Total?, naw thats per wrist
Tryin to compare this
My chains to yo chains
I'm like Sprint or Motorola, no service, outta ya range
You're outta ya brains, thinkin I'm a shout out ya name
You gotta come up with better ways than that to get ya fame
All this pressure you applyin, it's time to ease off
Before I hit you from the blind side
Takin' your sleeves off
As much as we floss
Still hard to please boss
Don't be lyin', bitchin' and cryin', suck it up as a loss
Cuz yo acts is wack
Yo whole label is wack
And matter of fact eh eh-eh eh eh
Hold that

I am number one
No matter if you like it here take it sit down and write it
I am number one
Eh eh eh eh eh eh! now let me ask ya man...
What does it take to be number one?
Two is not a winna and three nobody remembers
What does it take to be number one?
Eh eh eh eh!

Do you like it when I shake for ya, Daddy?
Move it all around? (Woo)
Let ya get a peek (uh-huh) before it touches the ground?

Hell yeah, ma I love a girl who's willin to learn
Willin' to get in the drivers' seat and willin to turn
And not concerned bout the he say
She say
Did he say
What I think he said?
Squash that, he probly got that off ebay
Or some internet access
Or some website chat line
Mad cuz I got mine
Oh don't wind up on the flat line
Oh if my uncle could see me now
If he could see how many rappers wanna be me now
Straight emulatin my style right to the down down
Can't leave out the store now
Betta wait till the calm down
I got hella shorties
Come and askin yo where the party
Oh lordy, will I continue to act naughty
Mixin' Cris' and Bacardi
Got me thinkin' for sure

Yo I'm tired of people judgin what's real hip hop
Half the time you be the niggas who's fuckin album flop
You know, boat done sank and it ain't left the dock
Mad cuz I'm hot, he just mad cuz he not
You ain't gotta give me my props
Just give me tha yachts
Give me my rocks
And keep my fans comin' in flocks
Til you top the Super Bowl
Keep your mouf on lock (shhhh, I'm awake haha)
I'm cocky on the mic
But im humble in real life
Take nothin for granted
Blessing everything on my life
Trying to see a new light
At the top of the roof
Baby name not Sigel
But I speak the truth
I heat the booth
Nelly acting so uncooth ( so crazy)
Top down shirt off
In the coupe
Spreadin the loot
With my - family and friends
And my - Closest to kin
And I - Do it again!
If it means I'ma win
Dirty

No matter if you like it here take it sit down and write it
