[Intro: Nelly]
I don't wanna go to bed without you
This is Simple Plan
I don't wanna go to bed without you
Talk to me

[Verse 1: Simple Plan]
I gotta tell you the truth
I'm full of broken pieces
And all my nights are sleepless
And I don't mean to intrude
This secret, can you keep it?
Won't give up even if it

[Pre-Chorus 1: Simple Plan]
Takes me all night, takes my whole life
Just won't feel right until I have you
Tired eyes burn, when will I learn?
Tell me what to do

[Chorus: Simple Plan]
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (No)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (No)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

[Verse 2: Simple Plan & (Nelly)]
Let's get this out of the way
Why should we wait forever?
We're meant to be together
I'm not ashamed to say (Let me tell you one time)
You don't remember my name
But I still want you the same

[Pre-Chorus 2: Simple Plan]
Love at first sight left me tongue tied
Just won't feel right until I have you
Tired eyes burn, when will I learn?
Tell me what to do (Tell me what to do, just say it)

[Chorus: Simple Plan]
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (No)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (No)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

[Verse 3: Nelly]
I don’t wanna go to bed without ya
No, you no lie no sleep without ya
Go crazy in the...
I go crazy without ya
E’ry dream, e’ry nightmare's about ya
I can’t lie, got love at first sight
Love the first night, I took my first bite
I’m, insane when I take aim, like
King James with the mid-range BANG!

[Pre-Chorus: Simple Plan]
Love at first sight
Left me tongue tied
Just won’t feel right (Until I have you)
Tired eyes burn
When will I learn?
Tell me what to do

[Chorus: Simple Plan]
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed (No)
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed
I don't wanna go to bed without you

[Outro: Nelly & Simple Plan]
I don’t wanna go to bed without ya
No, you no lie no sleep without ya
(This is Simple Plan, shawty, ha-ha)
(I don't wanna go to bed without you)
I don’t wanna go to bed without ya
No, you no lie no sleep without ya
(No, you no sleep)
(I don't wanna go to bed without you)
