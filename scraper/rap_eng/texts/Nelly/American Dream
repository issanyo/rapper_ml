[Hook x2: Nelly]
Yo it be I man, fuckin it up for errbody
I can't lie man, they thought I was just gettin started
Peep the pie man, its the american dream
I'm just participatin, my participation is game

[Nelly]
I'm makin this one for the hotel, motel, Holiday Inns
Super 8, Red and the Ritz Carlton's
All my niggas that tryin to ball, my niggas ballin
All my soldiers and generals, errbody fall in
Stop stallin, pick up the phone and call in
Tell your boss you ain't gon make it to work in the mornin
And while you explainin go head and throw a cough in
And kindly explain that this won't happen often
But I'm long and I'm amazed, I'm be willin then dazed
I rage that niggas think that derrty don't need a cage
I should be put on display, for the display I'm displayin
Half you niggas is dyin and all the rest are decayin
I'm doin tracks in hotels steady rockin girls bells
Kinda like a young L residin in Nellyville
I never squeal, not the type to kiss and tell
But if I catch ya in the shower I might kiss ya tail

[Hook x2: Nelly]
Yo it be I man, fuckin it up for errbody
I can't lie man, they thought I was just gettin started
Peep the pie man, its the american dream

Now as I bounced off, Kyweezy writin movies
Slo done took that mask off
Mo's the leader what do ya know, Murph run his ass off
I got every whip, derrty even got a Nascar
And you know we fucked up at his house
Ayo my rain on weed, naps and Japanese
Clap at g's, smack 'em back on they knees
Drop on wack, simple facts that rap needs
And its always Christ-a-mas and wrap trees
And I got my game, I said I got my game from the OG's
Smokin reefer, moonshine pumpin OD's
Bought a old plain chain, yeah you know me
Shipped in from Cali got it home, cops'll know these
Yo we smashed the summer
We oughta recoup, call NASA to do the numbers
All the friendship on the vocals started fire in the booth
Got more whips and chains than amastad and russe

[Kyjuan]
Ali I'm sicka ballin, unnecessary phone callin
Man down, pimp in distress I think I'm fallin
For anything but the okey doke
I'm old school like her and bones and nooky ropes
I can't stand no groupie folks
They want me to turn around like this is hokey poke
They wanna bring me down like Irv before I choked
I'm not a joke at all, I'm Quick-Draw-McGraw
And number 20 on the Lakers couldn't hold me yall
I'm climbin over yall, I'm still scorin
85 percenta yall awake but still snorin
Got knowledge of self and now my style is much older now
We Derrty Ent., We all we got we hold it down
I'm feelin cooler than cool, my wrist cold and wild
If theres a fashion king then I deserve the crown
I'm U-City, you dressin up I'm dressin down
And you keep messin up, me and your girl gon be messin

Around

[Murphy Lee]
Ayo I'm fresh out the gate
From the Lou with a Grammy in my resi'
Nelly bought me a presi' with a diamond in the besi'
Tics taught me how to walk so when I run I be ready
Female fans sayin that I'm they baby daddy
Whoa more attention than Justin and Janet
How I Midwest Swang and how I St. Louis Ram it
Derrty Ent. damnit, got more bread than a samich
And my wrist got more nuggets than Carmelo and Camby
Look, I'm from the Lou and I'm important like the Arch
So tourists look for me like an important part shoot
Find your talent, use your talent get your money
Or don't find your talent and don't use it and stay bummy
But that ain't on me cuz we built it from scratch
My neck shit is a house witha house in the back
Man I been wild since middle school, I was that little dude
That been around more waist lines than hula hoops
