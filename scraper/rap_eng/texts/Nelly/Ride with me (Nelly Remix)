If you wanna go take a ride with me
Cruise around togetha and betta we be free
Show you things youve never seen
Hold me and Leave your head to lean

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
Step to the car, Look in my eyes and gimme the key
Hold my hand, fingers curled around
And I'll show you that love is found

Shit don't what this feeling is
It's weird, I got tears
But I feel so happy inside
We spent the day and night
It was amazing
And it's still what i'm praising
Feels like it were the best days
Of my life, for them days u felt
To be my wife
It was great, better and amazing
A dream we've been chasing
And it finally happened
Unreal, unbelievable
Unretrievable
Can't explain this feeling
So happy and so sad
Now that's what you get
If you believe in true love
Even tho sometimes its rough
But its beauti-f-u-l
Being under a love spell
Your beauty was even more unreal
Real sex appeal
Everything that I feel
Just
Deep breath
We tear up and laugh
We hug and kiss
Compliment and diss
We do all the cliche
My music, I'm your DJ

If you wanna go take a ride with me
Cruise around togetha and betta we be free
Show you things youve never seen
Hold me and Leave your head to lean

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
Step to the car, Look in my eyes and gimme the key
Hold my hand, fingers curled around
And I'll show you that love is found

And my pillow still gives the smell of your hair
The distance is unfair, but oh mere, do I love you
And is that love true, I'm going in and all deep now
But this is How I feel now
You become more and more part of me
You stole that heart of me
It's confusing
But on the otherside amusing
Me and you sing
A love melody
And I feel mellow n free
And I hope I see you soon again
Need to make a new plan

I Don't know if I should cry
Cuz I feel happy and high
But sad is mixing in it
And man do I love your laugh, your giggle
The feeling I get, so biggo
And then you wiggle, and its cute
Puts me on a mute
And i can't talk, speechless
-------.....
Like you see in the movies
Or what people tell you, when someone
Slipped him roofies
Just a rainbow, and green grass appears
And the beautyness gives me tears
And every single movement you make
I hope I never awake
There's no way this can be real
Im in a dream
Im in for this, not the devils deal
All I need is you, no money no fame
Im wild, dont need to be tamed
Wild and free together, forever
Together clever, we won't sever
And we won't fall, never
