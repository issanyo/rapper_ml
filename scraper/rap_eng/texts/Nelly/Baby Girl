[Verse 1]
Baby girl you give me joy and excitement
I promise I'm never ke o thaide
Even though I got a girl you my side chick
I call you my girl, never my B
Best of both worlds you are hybrid
All your exes were a little shortsighted
'Cause they never ever saw all the right shit
That's why I buy you Dior, never Nike
You really change my mindset
'Cause I used to go for girls who are light skinned
When you drop it to the floor, girl it like it
When you drop it to the floor, girl it like it
I like your curly hair and your physique baby
You unique baby
You still complete baby

[Bridge]
Never conform, I swear you got it all
I always think about the first time we got it on
Back up, back up for me
Oh baby won't you back up, back up for me
'Cause I can get you wetter, set up, living better
I can show you levels never achieved
Aha

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and this lady got a thing goin' on
Ain't nobody know (nobody)
Keep it on the low ain't nobody gotta know
Baby this is how we go

[Chorus]
That's my baby, that's my baby, that's my baby girl
That's my baby girl
That's my baby, that's my baby, that's my baby girl
That's my baby girl

[Post-Chorus]
You my baby girl
You my baby girl
Aha

[Verse 2]
I never wanna lose you, baby never
I give all you all you want 'cause you precious
Pretty African girl, you a bad one
Pretty African girl, you a bad one
You deserve VVS diamonds
Private jets if you wanna choose a climate
When I'm with you all my days are the brightest
When I'm with you all my days
Sugar, sugar how you get so fly?
Pretty face and your hips don't lie
Sugar, sugar how you get so fly?
Pretty face and your hips don't lie
And your hips don't lie, your hips don't lie
They ain't gonna break us up but they still gon' try
They still gon' try

[Bridge]
Never conform, I swear you got it all
I always think about the first time we got it on
Back up, back up for me
Oh baby won't you back up, back up for me
'Cause I can get you wetter, set up, living better
I can show you levels never achieved
Aha

[Pre-Chorus]
Me and this lady got a thing goin' on
Ain't nobody know (nobody)
Keep it on the low ain't nobody gotta know
Baby this is how we go

[Chorus]
That's my baby, that's my baby, that's my baby girl
That's my baby girl
That's my baby, that's my baby, that's my baby girl
That's my baby girl

[Post-Chorus]
You my baby girl
You my baby girl
Aha

Baby this is how we go

[Chorus]
