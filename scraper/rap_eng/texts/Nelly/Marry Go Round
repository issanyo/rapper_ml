[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She take over the ring every time she come around
Just call her Ali by the way she knock 'em down
Or maybe LB 'cause that ass weight a pound
I'ma stand like a boss, watch marry go round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go

[Verse 1: Nelly]
She got that firecracker, fire flame, marry got that ice cream
All I wanna do is li-li-li-li-li-lick her clean
Throw her on a table, take over by that label
Show her why they call my Moses and show her my cane is able
Give it to ya, how you want it, Ms. Marry to let you know
If he don't eat it how you want it, Ms. Marry then let him go
I hang it out in California, we love the one on one
Been in the perfect corner with with marry and marijuana
Gettin' real, be in the 'lac, I'm blowin' bad with Ms. Marry in the back
I think she get it from her momma's momma
Last name should be body armour
She told like later on, I'ma need somebody over

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She take over the ring every time she come around
Just call her Ali by the way she knock 'em down
Or maybe LB 'cause that ass weight a pound
I'ma stand like a boss, watch marry go round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go

[Verse 2: Nelly]
See marry be poppin' it and I just be watchin' it
'Til we get to the crib and then I hop on top of it
She might be the bomb the way she tick-tockin' it
But when she blow this whistle, marry ain't gon' be no stoppin' it
In the blue corner, yeah, that's her
And in the red corner, yeah, that's her
I can see her bouncin' in a skirt
So down there Ms. Marry go to work
So pop it in this marry mac, put that ass all dressed in black
We both drippin' down your back, man, I might need a piece of that
She get it from her momma's momma
Last name should be body armour
She told like later on, I'ma need somebody over

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She take over the ring every time she come around
Just call her Ali by the way she knock 'em down
Or maybe LB 'cause that ass weight a pound
I'ma stand like a boss, watch marry go round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go

[Bridge: Nelly]
Do ya thing marry, do ya thing marry
Do ya thing marry, go do ya thing marry
Go do ya thing marry, drop it down marry
Do ya thing, babe, gon' head marry

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
She take over the ring every time she come around
Just call her Ali by the way she knock 'em down
Or maybe LB 'cause that ass weight a pound
I'ma stand like a boss, watch marry go round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go round
Go, round, go, round, go, round, go, round
Go, round, go, round, watch marry go
