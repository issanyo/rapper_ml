I boss thru in a Hummer, Murphy the Don, Lizzie, Keyuan
With the best thunder than Shaun Jon, you don't want none
Partna I gather up and leavin' heads swollen up
On top of all that, I got the rap sewed up
Hold up, with the Budda thumpin' niggas outa
And just the teach a lesson, I put one in ya shoulder
I told ya, 'tics live for the street life
Eat right, fuck good, And reffer thru the pipe
And give me head all night

And if its some beef, I pumpin' lead on sight
Until they deceased, I took ya head off right
I live in the beast
Nigga, where the Feds, play sheist
I still floss ice, keep it tight
Every time, call me the Black Liberace when I'm playing mine
Thats how I flow when I gotta get mine, anyway it go
Whether it be rapping or with the four four

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

My nigga, I can make a million
Blind-folded, with no shows
Using no flows, just Arm -n- Hammer
And folk O's
Gimmie low does and a connect, that neva closed
And watch me lock it down from North County to BenRos
Fuck some Mo-Mo's, Gimmie hundereds with soft chrome
On the Navigata equipped to click and log on

I leave that before its gone
'Fore they even bring it home
Matta fact, I'll tell you what's in the back, its all gone
Two holes in the roof, to let the sun come in
Match it leather car seat, in case my son get in
I spare one off in the back in case he bring his friend
Play Station just in case a nigga think he can win

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

I say now, tho yo wrappers off in tha air
But only if the ice on your wrist cause glares
I gettin' stares from down bitches, thats eatin' alone
West missies, 1-2-3-4 or 5 bottles of Cris's
On the table, arms the strong ripp off the label
No more shows for free, I'm pay per view like cable
They all screamin' my name, different shades and race

Take them all backstage and lett'em plead they case
Make a million like Jigga, standin' in one place
Sound Scan like Thrilla with out changing my face
They threw the weak plan B
Says who? Says me
Then whats plan A, 'cause plan B is a BOMB case

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

Let's make a million
Keep it real for triple-0
Eyes low, from plenty Henny and Hydro
Fuck a bitch and some clothes
I gotta get rich, go platinium in 2 shows
And get the dough

I gotta make a million
Gotta get myself a million
Gonna turn that into a billion
If not, then I just won't die

All my Midwest niggas tryin' to make a meal
Tho dem wrappas

All my Dirty South niggas tryin' to make a meal

All my West Coast niggas tryin' to make a meal
Tho dem wrappas
