[Intro]
(Record scratching...) Okay

...but right now here's the cane I prefer

[Hook 1: Nelly]
Someboy tippin' in da club
Bumpa dippin' in da club
Bumpa dippin' in da club
Bumpa dippin' in da club (Aooosh) (3x)
Someboy tippin' in da club
Bumpa dippin' in da club

Bumpa dippin' in da club (Need to till ya some'em)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I'm rich bitch, goddamn right
Hundred thou' on my left, a hundred mo' on my right
Shit, I'm the business, I know what you like
I know how you want it, I gave it to you more than twice
I'm 30 mil and countin', the money wired and routed
If you compare our accounts comparin' hills to mountains
I got them twenty inch mounted on somethin' blue as an avatar
Got clown whips, safe to say I got silly cars
Got movie stars, keep 'em bent over mini bars
Now all my Nicki broads wanna' have a minaj
And I'm like oh sugar, you betta come get her
Before I Bruce Jenner, run dick up in her man!

[Hook 2: Nelly]

Someboy tippin' in da club

[Verse 2: Nelly]
I'm rich bitch, goddamn right
Got 10 carats in my left, and 10 mo' in my right
Shit, I'm the business, I know what she like
I know where to bite, she grinnin' cause she know when I'm right
She like way I give orders, she like the way I deliver
She like the way I bus' her, bus' her, but I never raw dig her
Cause I'm a 9 figure, a supe in a coupe nigga
A view of the whole Lou', from the pool on the roof nigga
(Aye!) And you don't want it with me, yo
Shawty, say she ain't never But she want it with me yo
Oh sugar, You betta come get her
Before I Bruce Jenner, run dick up in her, man

[Hook 2: Nelly]

[Verse 3: Nelly]
I'm rich bitch, goddamn right
40 mil' on the wheel, 50 stacks on the fight
Shit, I'm the business, I'm just bein' polite
I need to enlighten you niggas and get you the total figures
I'm the best in the Lou', doing the stats in the Lou'
Provin', look at me like, "Who knew it?"
Delly, that's who knew it
I'm pushing that Bugatti, in front of the Ferrari
Carrera, the bitches starin' I'm feelin' a new era
I got some barlo just like a life boat
Nice strokes toke along Malibu
Oh sugar, you betta come get her
Before I Bruce Jenner, run dick up in her

[Hook 2: Nelly]
