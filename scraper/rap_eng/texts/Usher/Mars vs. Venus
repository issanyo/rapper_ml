[Intro]
Initiate radar
Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh ooh-ooh
Da do da do da do
Da do do doh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your eyes say it all... all
They're fixed upon an object of desire you can't control
No (no), but gravity compels you to ignite and explode
Ooh (ooh)
'Til our time and space combine, you'll fantasize the unknown
Ohhhh
Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seeing stars, baby

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love, and find out who's in control
Mars vs. Venus, yeah
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire
Sex, love, and find out who can tame desire?
Mars vs. Venus

[Verse 2]
Seduce and analyze, yeah
Objective is to conquer deep in kind... make paradise
Girl, it's taking off the ground
You know how I put it down
Have you seeing stars, ooh

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love, and find out who's in control (ooh, ooh)
Mars vs. Venus (ooh, Mars vs. Venus, Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang (yeah), step into the ring of fire (fire, yeah)
Sex, love, and find out who can tame desire?
(Know that I'm winning)
Mars vs. Venus (oh I'm gonna do it, baby, haha)
This is the big bang, so unpredictable (got a love thing, no)
Sex, love, and find out who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire
Sex, love, and find out who can tame desire?
Mars vs. Venus

[Bridge]
Oh, pitch black, lost amidst the galaxy between the sheets
Want that only you and I generate when we collide
Hold that, don't make my emotions peak
If I let go, then I'll be weak
Your control is my defeat, I repeat
Never, never, never, never will I give up
No, no, no no no
(I ain't giving up, no, ooh)

[Chorus]
This is the big bang, so unpredictable
Sex, love, (so unpredictable) and find out who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang, step into the ring of fire (she on fire)
Sex, love, and find out who can tame desire?
Mars vs. Venus (yeah yeah, yea-yeah, ooh)
This is the big bang, so unpredictable (this ain't a love thing, ooh)
Sex, love, and find out who's in control
Mars vs. Venus (Mars vs. Venus, if you wanna feel it)
(But when the worlds collide)
This is the big bang (ooh, catch it in orbit), step into the ring of fire
Sex, love, and find out (ooh) who can tame desire?
Mars vs. Venus

[Outro]
(But when the worlds collide, who, will, win?)
I don't know if I'll win
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
(Mars vs. Venus)
I don't know if I'll win
(But when the worlds collide, who, will, win?)
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
I don't know if I'll win (worlds collide)
But I know that I wanna do it again, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-yeah, love and desire)
I don't know if I'll ever win (desire)
Mars vs. Venus
