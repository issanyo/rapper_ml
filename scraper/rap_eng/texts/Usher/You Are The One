You S H E are
(Oh no no no no no)
You S H E are
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)

Check it, it was like six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On eighty-five headed to the plush
Ten minutes later is when we pulled up

I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt 'til we feel the gin, proceeded to walk in
Just then I saw this, magnificient misses sippin' on a glass of Cris'
With a couple of her friends giggling, I knew

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

Said I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here too
Can ya grill what ya wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you

Tell your friends they can hop in the truck
We'll take the Benz but if we split up
Maybe we can hook up again
You never know I guess that all depends

If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0
2-0 momos on low pros
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls "Come on, let's go" 'cuz you are

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three
