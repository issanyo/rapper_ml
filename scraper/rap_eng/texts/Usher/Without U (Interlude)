[Intro]
Love, such a lonely place
Nobody wants to be alone
To have the world, but no one to share it with

[Verse]
I am so alone
I can't stand this feeling of being without you
Yes, I'll do
Whatever it takes to prove I truly love you
Don't let me go
Let's stay together
Forever and ever
Can't sleep without you by my side
Help me
