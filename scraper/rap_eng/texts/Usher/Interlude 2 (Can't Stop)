[Verse: Usher]
Oh baby
I love you
Why did you go away?
Sitting in my window, day by day
Thinking of your face
Nothing in the world so strong
To take the tears away
Since you took your love away
My heart has not a home
Can't stop these tears from coming down
I just don't know what I did wrong

[Hook: Usher & Faith Evans]
Can't stop thinking of you
And you know I don't stop
My world's lost without you
I'm so lost without you, baby

[Bridge: Usher]
Baby, baby
No, no

[Hook: Faith Evans]
Can't stop thinking of you
My world's lost without you
