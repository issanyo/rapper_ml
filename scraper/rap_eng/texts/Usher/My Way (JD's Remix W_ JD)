[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo
See, it's rare that you find people like us
Cause all y'all other... (look)
Out there doing what I'm doing
Or try to do what I'm doing
But you can't 'cause I do what I do, my way
What about you?
Huh? Huh?! Come on!

[Verse 1: Usher]
I do
Any and everything you want to
Make your girl say, "Oooh, oooh
Why is he so fly-I-I?"
She beeps me
Ever since she wanna get freaky
You can get mad if you want to, do whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Verse 2: Usher]
Don't check me
It was your girl who let me
Take it this far, then, ooh wee!
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
And I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
She likes it...

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Usher]
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
My way, my way
You can't satisfy her needs
She keeps running back to see me do it
My way, my way
What I say, goes
And I'm in control
