[Intro]
Usher, Usher, Usher
Yeah, man

[Verse 1: Usher]
So we back in the club
With our bodies rocking from
Side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone
Back to life, back-back to life

[Pre-Chorus 1: Usher]
Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus: Usher]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby
Tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life
Go on get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Verse 2: Usher]
Keep downing drinks like there's
No tomorrow, there's just right
Now, now, now, na-na-now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker
Down, down, down, da-da-down, down

[Pre-Chorus 2: Usher]
Hands up
And the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those
Eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus: Usher]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life
Go on get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Abacadabra you can get naked
Then baby, I saw that you can
Better holla at Tyrone
Let him know Imma jump through
Your fruit loop, call that chico toucan
Went from the blocka blocka opa-locka
Where the boys get loose like Wacka flacka
Oh now man, itâ€™s global, wassup girl, dale flaca
I wanna be your guy, no not your dada
Dale abre ahi
Papa Nicholas baby, let me see
Yo soy el Cubanito que esta tostadito
Yo fresco, no, ok!

[Chorus: Usher]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love, falling in love
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life
Go on get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life
Go on get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Outro: Usher]
Yeah
Thank you, DJ
