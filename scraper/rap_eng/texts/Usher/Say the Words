[Intro]
Uh, this is for my
This is for my, one love, one love

[Verse 1]
I had a dream when I was just a little boy
To find a girl like you
We would meet at the park after school
And talk 'til the day was through
Then, you take me to your parent's house
And I would comb your hair
And we would dream of all the cities
And places we could go
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Verse 2]
I can still remember dreams as a little boy
Now, I’m a man and still can't put down my toys
(Hey, hey, hey)
Real love will never come if you in it now
But I had to learn that lesson down in the south
Back to spending nights on the town, just to have a little fun
In my mind, I'm wishing she’s the one (I said to myself)
Is this too close to reality
For you to be that girl from my fantasy?

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Bridge]
She stole my head and let’s go play the dream again
To find a girl like you (only you and me around)
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe (you and I are intertwined)
I look into your eyes
And I see our universe (love is pure, so divine)

[Chorus]
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night
Say the words that you know I wanna hear
Put your heart up close to my ear
We don't need to know the time
We could stay 'til the day turns to night

[Outro]
This is dedicated
From the fire, we'll rise
To my one and only ever love
I would never, ever, ever, ever love again
This is dedicated (you know who you are)
To my one and only ever love (the only girl I've ever loved)
