[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P
Oh, oh, oh, T-T-P

[Verse 1]
Somebody tell me
Why do people stay in situations that'll never work?
And 'bout you wanna leave and you can't wait to get even
But deep inside, it really hurts
You never should've ever got in the mix
You never understand till you go through it
All the right things to say, the wrong things to do
Why you out and trying to pick and choose?

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package

[Verse 2]
I used to be young and dumb and always wanted to run
In the streets 'cause I thought that was where it was at
But it wasn't, all it did was leave a brother in the cold
With nowhere to go
I caught myself slipping, thinking I was the lick
I was tripping, trying to jump dip to dip
I thought it was the way to be happy
Until somebody took time to tell me

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package

[Verse 3]
So many people think they got it, but they don't have a clue
You gotta have more than just a body for me to be talking about you
Take it from me, when playing the game, your day will come
When you gotta stop what you doing, start looking for the one

[Bridge]
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it
All and together now
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop
You got to get it, get it

Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop (trying to be with somebody that keeps it)
You got to get it, get it
Don't stop
Keep looking, fellas
Don't stop

[Chorus]
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
You should be looking for a T.T.P
Now that I know the difference, that's all I'm trying to be with
Somebody that keeps it all in together now
I'm living better since I found the total package
