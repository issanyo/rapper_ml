[Intro]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot ya

[Chorus]
You keep listening to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby
Baby when I'm with you, I don't take any phone calls
Cause when I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby, baby

[Verse 1]
Tongue game, make you believe in that shit
Stick game, make you believe in that shit
Shoe game, wrist game
Tell me baby, what you want of that shit
Net worth 'bout the same as Netflix
Chill with a nigga and I'll show you that shit
I swear that my shit could turn into your shit
We can call it our shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's why them bitches hating over there
I'll take you shopping like anywhere
Tokyo or Sydney, I take you there
And I get you alone, serenade them cookies (la-la, la-la, haha)
Whatever you want, I swear you can get it with me

[Chorus]
You keep listening to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby
Baby when I'm with you, I don't take any phone calls
Cause when I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
One hunnid, yeah believe in that shit
No games, I believe in that shit
Girl if I think it, I said it, I mean it
Believe in that shit
I'm too rich to fall for that shit
She ain't shit for me to cheat with
You like bitches, I like bitches
We can get bitches to keep a secret
We got that ghetto love (ooohhhh)
Nothing can break it up
I roll a blunt
You pop a brownie, yo baby we touch on drugs (hahahaha)
Baby together, we so crazy
Love me forever, you're obviously my baby

[Chorus]
You keep listening to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby
Baby when I'm with you, I don't take any phone calls
Cause when I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby, baby

[Verse 3]
Show you better than I can tell you, I bet ya
Moment I met ya, knew that I was gonna get ya
Too much sauce dripping, don't be acting like you acting
Don't be acting like you don't see the shit that I've been doing
Who you think you fooling? Nobody but yourself
(Damn you knew from the beginning
Girl don't you be overthinking
Me plus you that equals winning)
Telling you should be all in, all in it babe

[Chorus]
You keep listening to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby
Baby when I'm with you, I don't take any phone calls
Cause when I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer, baby, baby

[Outro]
This your shit, believe it
