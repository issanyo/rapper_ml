U-S-H-E-R
U-S-H-E-R
Come on, come on
1-2-3

[Verse 1]
It was, like, six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On 85, headed to the Plush
10 minutes later is when we pulled up
I parked the Benz
Hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt to reveal the gems
Proceeded to walk in, just then, I saw this
Magnificent misses
Sipping on a glass of Cris
With a couple of her friends giggling
I knew...

[Chorus]
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl

[Verse 2]
Said, I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here, too
Keep it real, what you wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you
Tell your friends
They can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz
But if we split up, maybe we can hook up again
You never know, I guess that all depends
If I can get you from the floor to the door of my six-O-O
Two-O momo's and low Pro's
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls, "come on, let's go"
'Cause you are...

[Chorus]
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl

[Bridge]
U-S-H-E-R
Say it
U-S-H-E-R
1-2-3

[Chorus]
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl
You are the one
I don't give a damn
Even if you got a man
Take my hand, girl
You are the one
Girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance
Take a chance, girl

[Outro]
U-S-H-E-R
Say it
U-S-H-E-R
1-2-3
U-S-H-E-R
Say it
U-S-H-E-R
