[Intro: Kid Ink]
It's Kid Ink, yeah yeah, watch this

[Chorus: Usher, Kid Ink & Tinashe]
It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa
But I can tell from your body language
Okay let's talk about it, is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it , can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh said you ain't gotta say too much
Hate when you say that I play too much
When I get too close I'mma touch that subject
I can read yo body, nuff said
Quit all that yapping
Need less talk and a little more action
Yeah, now girl keep it G, know you speak a lil freak
I can hear it in yo accent
Said tell me, can you understand my language?
If you tryna ride, just stay in my lane
There's no other way to explain it
In layman's fuck who you came with

[Chorus: Usher, Kid Ink & Tinashe]
It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa
But I can tell from your body language
Okay let's talk about it, is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it , can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It ain't hard to tell
If you don't wanna take it too far, then well
You better stop flirting and stop twerking
So perfect, cause it's working
That ass worth all the worship
You been in yo bag like Birkin
Never had it like this before me
You ain't know girl, better read up on me
You tryna get high got to re-up on me
Being stuck up gon' leave you lonely for the night
We should leave before the light's
On, girl, I'm too on

[Chorus: Usher, Kid Ink & Tinashe]
It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa
But I can tell from your body language
Okay let's talk about it, is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it , can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much

[Bridge: Usher & Tinashe]
Oh, they say don't judge a book by its cover
We can make a scene that you be under the cover
Listen, you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
You ain't gotta say much, you ain't gotta say much, girl I'm talking, girl I'm listening, come closer, let me hear ya

[Chorus: Usher, Kid Ink & Tinashe]
It's not a lot that you've been saying, whoa
But I can tell from your body language
Okay let's talk about it, is you 'bout it?
Let's talk about it , can we talk about it?
But you ain't gotta say too much, you ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
You ain't gotta say too much
I can read your body language
