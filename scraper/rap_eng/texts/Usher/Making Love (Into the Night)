[Verse 1]
Just tell me where to go
And I'll take off my clothes
For you
You're in total control
And you're running the show
I'll do whatever you tell me, baby

[Chorus]
Baby, I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night
(Forever and ever, we'll make love into the night)

[Verse 2]
Your wish is my command
So I'll cancel my plans
Tonight
You understand
That I'm the only one who can handle your body right
And I'ma show you tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night
(Forever and ever, we'll make love into the night)

[Bridge]
If you ever wanna know
Who I love
That's you, that's you
It's you, yes, you
Oh, and I ain't never leaving, baby, you gotta believe me
You're the one I love, ain't gotta ask who I love
'Cause that's you, that's you
Yes, you, yeah, you

[Chorus]
Baby, I can come by and pick you up
We'll make love into the night, it's never enough
Oh babe, I know what you like
And I would make love to you forever and ever
Into the night
(Forever and ever, we'll make love into the night)

[Outro]
You gonna wanna tell everybody 'bout how I got you all
Coming when I call, you know I'll break you off
And if these walls could talk, they would tell everybody
'Bout how I put it down, you know I shut you down
Got you up off the ground, yes, I can't be wasted
And if I let you on my spaceship, you'll have to let me taste it
Hop on it, I'ma give you a ride
'Cause we gonna make love all through the night
