[Intro: Consequence]
Uh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need y'all to bounce for me. Uh. I need y'all to bounce for me. What? I need y'all, I need y'all

[Hook: Usher]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

[Consequence talking over the hook]
Yeah, yo Chi. L-Roc. I got a confession to make. [?] running these streets. And that's with Kan Man. Kanye West. GLC. And of course your boy from the 1-9-3...Con to the quence. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Word up. Let's go

[Verse One: Consequence]
I got a mess that can't be mopped up
Chilling with my girl and guess who popped up
A chick from the road that says she's knocked up
Next thing I know your boy's locked up
Cause the one I rocked up is worse than upset
Wish I could take it back, reverse the blood test
Cause I was in the hood getting hooptie love
Till I hit the road and groupie love
Stacked all my paper got a crew with dubs
Now I'm the one that all the groupie's love
But how I'mma tell my secret to a pillow talker?
That's too caught up and she's still a stalker
My days are darker
Fate is altered
And me and baby girl ain't make the alter
But after all of that I done learned my lessons
Matter of fact, these are my confessions

[Hook]

[Kanye talking over the hook]
Yeah. Kanye To The...The Roc is in the building

[Verse Two: Kanye West]
My nigga Usher called me, said a chick caught him and she bawling, crying
Said she got his baby and he say she lying
But he can't deny it, he went raw dawg
Aw nah, hell nah
You don' up and done it man
I remember ol' girl, yep
Met her on tour
I seen your baby, he dance good as hell...it's yours!
You don't realize, you just made a ghetto girl's dreams
She don't need a ring cause she got you till he 18
And I know you want to know, was there room in them jeans
And you get ass so I won't assume you was fiendin'
But these girls is genius's, we thinking with our penis's
In my opinion, that's when they take us to the cleaners

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Usher]
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second baby please hear me"

[Hook]

[GLC talking over hook]
Almost cried, but I'mma player so I do how I do it. I'm GLC. Hood Celebrity, know what I'm talkin' bout?

[Verse Four: GLC]
Baby I was broke and I was pimping 'em girl
She gave me her world and I ain't give her nothin'
I knew she was frontin'
You can ask for real, I'm GLC, I get it how I live
Weight on my shoulders like the Man Of Steel
I get it like a champ, I ran through her camp
I only hit her cause you wasn't there
Baby where was you at?
She bought me some sounds, bought me an ounce
I ain't bought nothing, I ain't high or nothin'
Last time you said I was trying to hit your cousin
Until I told you I wasn't
Baby I'm sorry for the pain impression
Let me replace it with pleasure
If you gon' cry don't ask them questions
Let's listen to Usher, that's my confession

[Hook]
