[Intro]
Man, I know what you used to
We gon' do something different tonight
Ohh-uuu
Ohhh, ohhhh-uuu

[Verse 1]
Now, we gon' do this thing a little different tonight
You gon' come over and pick me up in your ride
You gon' knock, then you gon' wait
Oooh, you gon' take me on a date
You're gonna open my door
And I'ma reach over and open yours
Gon' pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear, how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

[Chorus]
I'm always on the top, tonight, I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places
Now put it on me, baby, 'til I say, "ooo wee"
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
We're trading places

[Verse 2]
I plan on waking you up to a cup of Folgers
Pancakes and eggs, I owe you breakfast in bed, oh baby
And your orange juice sitting on a coaster
Toast on the side, baby, strawberry and grape jelly
You finished, let me get that drink
Pull the curtain from the windows
Time to get up, baby, let me make this bed up, ah yea'
Today, we going shopping, blowing 30 on me
Make it 60, spend it like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gon' rent a movie
You order chinese food right before you do me
You coming on strong baby let me wash my hands
She said, "hurry up", then, "get your **** in bed"

[Chorus]
You get on the top, tonight, I'm on the bottom
'Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
'Cause we trading places
Now put it on me, baby, 'til I say, "ooo wee"
And tell me to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
We're trading places
Gon' get it (gon', get it), get it get it
(Gon' get it get it), get it get it
Gon' get it (gon' get it), get it get it
(Get it get it), get it get it
Gon' get it (gon' get it), get it get it
(Get it get it), get it get it
We're trading places

'Cause we trading places
