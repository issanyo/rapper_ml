[Intro]
Hello everybody
Welcome, today, to the wonderful world of you
Now, check it, you have two options:
You can eat it
Or throw it away

[Verse 1]
See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well People hate you
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let them make you feel
Like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live
You gotta do for you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Dig that)
If you work hard, play hard (dig that)
And do what you wanna do (dig that)
Just pop your collar, don't let what people say bother you (dig that)
You perpetrators, I got something to say (dig that)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my trap
But can you dig that?

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Verse 2]
You can see me every week
Hanging out with a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't phase me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Dig that)
Never going home alone (dig that)
If she follows, then you know it's on (dig that)
She use the pager, not the cellular phone (dig that)
I let her know I won't be around for long (dig that)
To all you haters, I got something to say (what's that?)
You can eat it or throw it away (picture that)
Stop hating, wishing, waiting
Anticipating for my heat to fade

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you

[Bridge]
I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat, just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
Nobody's gonna steal the crown
Because I eat good, I live good
I rock good, my life good
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop your collar, don't be afraid to show it

[Chorus]
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
Hey, ladies (yeah)
Hey, fellas (yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous
They only hate you cause you're a go-getter
Pop your collar, don't let them sweat you
