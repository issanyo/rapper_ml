[Intro]
You know I wanna get a little something
You didn't know
Little secret
It ain't what you got, baby
It's what you do with it
And you doing it
You doing it

[Verse 1]
My guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire
Caught in a love affair with feminine iconic style
So fine, you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body going to waste
Prefer to see you in the bare necessities
Like Coco de Mer or La Perla, baby
Getting me aroused in that intimate attire
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like
Vicky got a secret, everybody knows
Lady in the street, in bed hoes and me
Wearing Cosabella
With nothing but a trench coat, nothing's better

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're a goddess, when you slip that Eres on
Don't stop, your sexy silhouette on the wall turns me on
Good God, your bod
And our bod keep deep
Don't mope when I say nice, but nasty
I wanna tell your man, I do what I say
(Put it on me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Wanna make me harder?
Put it on, here's what I want you to do
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Bridge]
What you gonna do? You gonna put it on?
Girl, you so sexy, you ain't gotta take it off
I want you to feed my fetish, slide them thigh-highs down
You looking at me, got me up
Throw them heels back on, come one
Put it on
Girl, you know you turn me on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Outro]
I'ma take it off, girl
I'ma put it on, girl
