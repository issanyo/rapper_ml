[Intro]
Yeah, um...
See, it's situations like this
That causes us playas to get caught up
(Truth hurts)
In, um, the truth, yeah, yeah
What you been doing, where you been?
I paged you and you ain’t hit me back (truth hurts)
And I've been calling and I know you see my number on that caller I.D (truth hurts)
Just listen to the words

[Verse 1]
(I got reason to believe that you've been fooling around)
The way you feel, the past you lived
The things you did
It don’t matter to me
For what it’s worth, just don’t lie to me
'Cause that ain’t what I need right now
Baby, everything we built on trust
You're tearing it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts (truth hurts)

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Verse 2]
Girl, I’m really trying hard to understand
I want to move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain’t doing nothing
Must be my insecurities
It’s got the best of me right now, uh
What I know, I can’t hold it inside of me
It’s gon' drive me insane
That's how I know the truth hurts, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Bridge]
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah (sing it with me now)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (oh yeah)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah (I can't hold on)
Truth hurts

[Verse 3]
Now wait a minute
Oh, listen babe (truth hurts)
The truth is, I've got the secret
I've been keeping from you, baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face
Pull the hot grits out, I think you need to sit down, oh
I've been blaming you when I'm the one that's doing wrong
I'm gonna go on
My guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song
Girl, I know the truth hurts, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around
Tell me the truth now
What you been doing and who you been doing it with (truth hurts)
Where you been going and how you been putting your thing down (truth hurts)
Whatever you was working, I hope that it was worth it, baby (truth hurts)
I got reason to believe that you been fooling around

[Outro]
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah (sing it)
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
Bah, bah, bah, bah
