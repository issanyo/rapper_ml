Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
What we about is just
Get, get on down
Get, uh
Brandy
Fricky

[Verse 1: Brandy]
Don't even think about callin' me crazy
You know you peeped that lady, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when I turned and look at you, you tried
To play it off but I can tell that you two were friends (ah)
She was just too nervous (ah)
She was lookin' like she was hurt
Like the memory had surfaced (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It kinda got her pissed (Yeah, yeah)
I'm kinda wonderin' myself
And your really no help
Tell me how you two know each other so well (Yeah, yeah)
Cause I want to know now (Yeah)
You better start talkin' (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus (Brandy, then Usher)]
Who is she to you (Yeah)
Don't lie to me
Who is she to you
My eyes can see
Something's going on between you two (Something's goin' on)
I think you better let me know
That's fa sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who is she to me?
Nobody, babe
Who is she to me?
No need to explain
There's nothing wrong
And I swear to you
Nothing going on with us
That's fa sho

[Verse 2 (Usher)]
See, I don't know why homegirl keeps on denying
On everything, I'm not lying
You make it worse acting all insecure
She see you buggin, so that's why she want to keep spying
Go ahead and say you don't trust me
Always going out of your way to bust me
You come up empty-handed
You wouldn't understand it
You better go ahead and listen
Girl, you got it twisted
Don't be playing, it brought no attention
'Cause you're the one I'm with
Don't be asking me

[Chorus 2 (Brandy, then Usher)]
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Who is she?)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (My eyes)
Something's going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's fa sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who is she to me?
Nobody, babe (Nobody, babe)
Who is she to me?
No need to explain (No need to explain)
There's nothing wrong
And I swear to you
Nothing going on with us (Oh)
That's fa sho (Oh)

[Bridge (Brandy, then Usher)}
Damn right I want to know her name (Why?)
Tell me how you know her, baby (I don't)
Why did she make that face (I don't know, I don't know)
You were looked ashamed

I'm not ashamed
I'm surprised you'd think of me as that guy
I never done you wrong
What's going on?
I don't know


[Chorus 3 (Brandy, then Usher)]
Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Who is she?)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (What did you do?)
Something's going on between you two
I think you better let me know
That's fa sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who is she to me?
Nobody, babe  (Girl, you must me crazy)
Who is she to me?
No need to explain (To think I'd cheat on my baby)
There's nothing wrong
And I swear to you
Nothing going on with us
That's fa sho

Who is she to you?
Don't lie to me (Baby, don't lie)
Who is she to you?
My eyes can see (Tell me the truth)
Something's going on between you two (Oh, yes there is)
I think you better let me know
That's fa sho (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Who is she to me?
Nobody, babe  (Nobody, baby)
Who is she to me?
No need to explain (No need to explain)
There's nothing wrong
And I swear to you
Nothing going on with us
That's fa sho
