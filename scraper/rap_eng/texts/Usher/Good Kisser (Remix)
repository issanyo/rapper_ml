[Intro]
Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby
Watch this

[Hook]
I done been around the world
I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessing that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang


(Ross Talking)
Smoking on this mcig, you can smell it

Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you

[Verse: Rick Ross]

Ugh
Rebel without a cause
No umbrella the money’s stuffed in the doors
Rodeo drive, the money old as Clive Davis
Blue papers still chasing dead faces
Dark tints, rims chalk like razors
2 mill to the side for the cases
Bawse 
Pinky ring both hands
Moskowitz wanna lean on a man
Peter pan got exed out the plans
Little homie still be moving like the fed
My Spanish chick be on that Telemundo
Pretty face and she got the fattest culo
Kissing all on me, tension all on me
Touch a little paper, start switching all on me
I'm looking for the best kisser
With a passport time to get missing
Bawse

[Chorus]
Kisser!
Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!! (Listen let me tell you something, uh!)

[Hook]
I done been around the world
I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessing that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you

[Verse 2]
This girl, she's my hero
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen
(I ain't want to check off either)
I'm starin' at your barrel
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe

[Refrain]
See, I told her
The devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open fire
You make me want to tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I think I got a winner
Could be a keeper

[Chorus]
Kisser!
Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Verse 3]
Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me, baby, with good flow
Don't ever run it back, come on, keep going
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me
I can't keep my control
Every time that I see you hit that floor
Just keep on giving it to me, I want mine
Just come on baby, just give it to me, give it up to me
Heyyyyyyyyyyy!!!! Yeah!!!


[Bridge]
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night (we be kissin all night!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night (oooh!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night (all night!)
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night (ohhhhh! She’s a good)


[Chorus]
Kisser! Got lipstick on my leg, oh baby
Oh! Ohhhhh!!! She's such a good kisser!
I'm a rain on this parade, oh baby!
Ohhhhhhhh!!!!!

[Hook]
I done been around the world I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessin that it's true
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you bang bang bang!
Don't nobody kiss it like you don't nobody kiss it like you
