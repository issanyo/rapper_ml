[Intro]
I, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence
You know it's in her attitude
The way she walks, nice legs (ummm)
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist (uh umm)
Fat ass (hahaha), ooh
And them soft little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips

[Breakdown]
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Huh, the crazy shit is you the only girl I love
Little lips, little lips, little lips

[Verse 1]
I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text
Saying "baby are you far, want you to come closer to my heart"
I miss you girl, whoever you are

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you, already
Girl I miss you, yeah

[Breakdown]
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips

[Verse 2]
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup (ahh)
And, if I ever cheat, all she gonna taste is your flavor, real shit, ooh
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up, ahh
Even though I can't see you so far
Looking just like the tint on my car
I miss you girl, whoever you are

[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you already, I..

[Post-Chorus]
I like the way your frame is, uhh
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gon-na be, huh
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was

[Bridge]
Take this, take that girl, but don't take time
To take my heart, baby come claim mine
Won't wait forever but I wait for you
Don't take too long girl 'cause I'm missing you

[Chorus]
Miss you, already
And I wanna kiss you, already, hah
Come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up, come on home
Girl I miss you, already
I miss you, I do
