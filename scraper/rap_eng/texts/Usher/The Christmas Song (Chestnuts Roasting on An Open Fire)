[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose, yeah
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loading lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly, yeah

[Chorus: Usher & Justin Bieber]
And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Yeah and so, I'm offering this simple phrase, oh woah
To kids from one to ninety-two, yeah yeah
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas yeah, Merry Christmas oh no, Merry Christmas to you
