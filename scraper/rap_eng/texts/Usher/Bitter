[Verse 1]
You know you make me feel some type of way
Strolled through campus yesterday, and you ain’t look my way
Yeah, we used to do it in the Buick, right
Sex in the backseat every night, you were my kryptonite
Got me out here lookin’ foolish, now
You ain’t a maverick, fabricating hoe ass niggas, now
Say you’re the victim, take a look around
Silent, but deadly
Take my heart, but you don’t make a sound

[Pre-Hook]
You know that it makes me mad
When we're the phone
We hang up, you never call me back
You know that it makes me mad
When you’ll never explain to me what you did
Why you do me like that?
You knew I’d be mad, ‘cause I’m sad and I’m lonely
And you know that ain’t fun
You’re all I think about
I only think of when I’m loving you for hours
Touching you for hours
Fucking you for hours, oh

[Hook]
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You know I'm, you know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
Bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
Call me bitter, yeah
You can call
Y-y-y-y-you can call me bitter
Ohhh

[Verse 2]
I left them Magnum horses in your backseat
Remember when we used to fuck to Blackstreet?
I liked the way you worked it on me, thought you felt the same
Spotify and booty calls, playing all your fucking games
Level one, here we go—fuck me with cartoons on
Brain like Jimmy Neutron, with your Jimmy Choo’s on
Gotta blast, then you go, yeah, you leave me all alone
Messages on read, say your phone’s dead
Now, I’m like

[Pre-Hook]
You know that it makes me mad
When we're the phone
We hang up, you never call me back
You know that it makes me mad
When you’ll never explain to me what you did
Why you do me like that?
You knew I’d be mad, ‘cause I’m sad and I’m lonely
And you know that ain’t fun
You’re all I think about
I only think of when I’m loving you for hours
Touching you for hours
Fucking you for hours, oh

[Hook]
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You know I'm, you know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
You know I'm bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
Bitter, yeah
You can call me bitter
Call me bitter, yeah
You can call
Y-y-y-y-you can call me bitter
Ohhh
