I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I do to that body
I get you like
Oh, baby baby, oh, baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Got no drink in my hand
But I'm wasted
Getting drunk of the thought of you naked
I get you like
Oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby

And I ain't trying to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax, sing it on your back

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby
If you wanna scream

If you wanna scream, yeah

Kill the lights, shut 'em off
You're electric
Devil eyes telling me
Come and get it
I have you like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby
Girl, tonight you're the prey
I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there
Take you under
Imagine me whispering in your ear
That I wanna take off your clothes
And put something on ya

And I ain't trying to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax, sing it on your back

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby

If you wanna scream, yeah
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby
If you wanna turn right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby baby
Ah, oh baby baby, oh baby

If you wanna scream
