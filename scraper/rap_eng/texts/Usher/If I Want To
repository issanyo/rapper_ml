[Verse 1: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Every time I look up
I see it in your face, you wanna hook up with me(You know you wanna hook up, stop playing
Instead of acting like you supposed to
You cop an attitude like you're too good for me
And you know good and damn well that

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

[Verse 2 Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Ain't nobody trying to clown you
But you're too damn old to play high school games with me
You know that, too damn old
Yes, you do
'Cause even when I'm not around you
I hear from my friends you be asking 'bout me
"What's up with him?" That's what you be saying

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I don't really care
How long you've been together with your man
It's just a matter of time
Before I make you mine
I wanna make it clear
So there's no misunderstandings
That I get, what I want
When I want

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby

[Bridge: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
That I get, what I want
When I want
If I wanted to
If I wanted to
I'd have you doing whatever I want you to, you know?
Right now, I'm just not really doing that
But if I wanted to, anything
I'm saying
You and your girls, I could have them too
Listen to me
It's crazy, listen

[Chorus: Usher]
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
If I wanted, I could take you from your man (please believe it)
With my eyes closed, I could have you eating out the palm of my hand
And all your little girlfriends, too
(No you can't, you're a playa, I don't want you)
Yes I can, and I will if I, if I want to
If I, if I want to, baby
