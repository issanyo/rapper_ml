[Intro: Usher]
When we come together, it's a miracle

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't know we'd overcome
Impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

[Verse 1: Usher]
I know what's inside you
How could I forget
When you're the only thought in my head
Take my hand
Girl, lets get lost
And ain't nowhere to find us
It's like heaven when we collide through
The world slows down as our hearts speed up
Candle lights burn out
But a fire in us
It's something that I believe in
I see you all around
So glad that I found that about ya

[Pre-Hook]
God dang sexy
God dang gold
God dang anything you know then you know

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't how we'd overcome
Impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

[Verse 2: Usher]
Miracles
Girl your love's my cover
I feel invincible
Miracles
When we touch I light up
We rough
I can't get enough
The world slows down as our hearts speed up
Candle lights burn out
But a fire in us
When we touch I light up
We rough
I can't get enough

[Pre-Hook]
God dang sexy
God dang gold
God dang anything you know then you know

[Hook: Usher]
Better than walking on water
Or breathing in space
Bigger than
Living forever
Making it rain
Miracles
Didn't know we'd overcome
The impossible
Making it rain
Miracles

A miracle
A miracle
