[Chorus]
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
You know that I will
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
You know that I will

[Verse 1]
Listen, honey baby
There's something that I've gotta make clear
You may have had other lovers in your life
That can't compare to what's going down here
I promise I'll be gentle
I'm gonna give you all that I've got
Don't say no, let your body go
I'll do my thing nice and slow if you tell me your thoughts

[Chorus]
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
I will
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
I will

[Verse 2]
Girl, I wanna work your body
Like your body was a 9-to-5
And just when you think I'm getting tired, baby
I'll be putting in overtime
I only want to please you
To tease you is not my style
Just let me know when you're ready for love
Girl, you've gotta make up your mind

[Chorus]
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
I will
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
I will

[Bridge]
I will pay anything to know what's on your mind (whatever you want from me, pretty baby)
I will pay anything to know what's on your mind (yes, I will, alright)
I would pay anytime (you know I'll pay anytime)
Tell me what's on your mind (please tell me, baby)
I would pay anytime
Tell me what's on your mind (tell me, baby, baby)

[Outro]
Whatever you want, girl
Whatever you need, lady
I'll be right there for you, baby
Yes, I will
I'll pay a penny for your thoughts
A nickel for your kiss
I will
