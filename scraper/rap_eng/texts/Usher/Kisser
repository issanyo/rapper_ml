[Verse 1]
I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessing that it's true
I done had a lot of guys that try
But theres nobody kissing like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you
