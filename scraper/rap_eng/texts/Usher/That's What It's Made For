[Intro: Usher]
Ooh, yeah baby yeaah
Uhhuhhuhhuhhmmm
Yeaah babe
Ooh, ooh
Oh, yeah
Listen up, I got a story to tell
Check it out now
And I know you can identify with this one
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Check it out

[Verse 1: Usher & girl]
Figured I'd hit it and quit it just one night
Got so good to me doubled back twice, I
Must've been outta my mind
Knowing I don't wanna
I'm about to nut up
Guess it's too late to turn back now
Can't apologize 'cause that ain't my style
Shorty raining wet, up in my ear talking 'bout
I got what you came for, this here got your name on it

[Chorus: Usher]
Go on and hit it
That's what it's made for
We got protection
That's what it's made for
Boo, why you tripping now?
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

[Verse 2: Usher]
Game rules, no cap, no cut
But even Superman couldn't turn your love down, I
Slipped up, slipped in
Hey man, what the hell you doing?
Raw dog is a never
I know I know better
Heard her whisper, "don't worry, I'm safe"
Didn't matter 'cause it's already too late
I was lost in the sauce, dead wrong
And I ain't stopping now
Parlaying in the bush again
Didn't think about what I was putting in it

[Chorus: Usher]
Go on and hit it
That's what it's made for
She said, "You got something on, right?"
That's what it's made for
Boo, why you tripping?
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this
Best stay where you are
That's what it's made for
Player, player, put it down
That's what it's made for
Oh baby turn around
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
So I can do you like this, baby
So I can freak you like this, baby
Know you ain't felt it like this, baby
Girl I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

[Interlude: Usher & girl speaking]
I gotta go
Mm-mm, you ain't gotta go nowhere
Look baby I, something's coming up, I gotta--
Mm mm, just get it up one more time. Let me touch it
Again?
Again and again and again
Baby, look--
Come on, you know that's what it's made for
You want me to sweat it out?
I want you to sweat it all out
I'ma get it, baby
Get it, take it
Okay
Take it
I'ma get up inside

[Chorus: Usher]
That's what it's made for (that's what it's made for)
That's what it's made for
Don't trip, I got protection
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
I'm gon' do you like this, baby
Freak you like this
Felt it like this
We gon' still get down like this
That's what it's made for
Oh, player, player, put it down
That's what it's made for
Too late to turn back now
You know I got it
That's what it's made for
Do you like this
Freak you like this
Felt it like this
Girl, I forgot it
But we gon' still get down like this

[Outro: Usher]
And that's only the beginning
God, I might as well just go to sleep here
Damn
