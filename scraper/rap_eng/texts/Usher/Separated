[Verse 1]
If love was a bird, then we wouldn't have wings
If love was a sky, we'd be blue
If love was a choir, you and I could never sing
'Cause love isn't for me and you
If love was an Oscar, you and I could never win
'Cause we can never act out our parts
If love is the Bible, then we are lost in sin
Because it's not in our hearts

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

[Verse 2]
If love was a fire, then we have lost the spark
Love never felt so cold
If love was a light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream
'Cause love isn't for me and you

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off separated

[Bridge]
Girl, I know we had some good times
It's sad, but now we gotta say goodbye
Girl, you know I love you, I can't deny
I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much, but it's best for us
Somewhere along this windy road, we lost the trust
So I'll walk away so you don't have to see me cry
It's killing me so, why don't you go?

[Chorus]
So why don't you go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
Baby, you'll do well, and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off
Go your way and I'll go mine
Live your life and I'll live mine
You'll do well and I'll be fine
'Cause we're better off, so much better off...

[Outro]
So much better off
Separated
I'm sorry we didn't make it
