[Chorus]
I'm crazy, so crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy, so crazy
About you (crazy 'bout you, baby)

[Verse 1]
What kind of love is this
That keeps me hypnotized?
Can't' get you off my mind
Don't ever let it end
Let it go on and on and on
'Cause you know it turns me on

[Pre-Chorus]
So whisper in my ear, just what I want to hear
'Cause no one can love me like you do
Ooh, that's why I'm...

[Chorus]
I'm crazy, so crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy, so crazy
About you (crazy 'bout you, baby)

[Verse 2]
I'd like to take this time
To tell you how I feel
To let you know the deal
So baby, let's make plans
I want you to be my only girl
'Cause you know I'll be your man

[Pre-Chorus]
So whisper in my ear, just what I want to hear
'Cause no one can love me like you do
Ooh, that's why I'm...

[Chorus]
I'm crazy, so crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy, so crazy
About you

[Bridge 1]
I'm crazy about you
About you
I'm crazy about you
About you

[Chorus]
I'm crazy, so crazy
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy, so crazy
About you (crazy 'bout you, baby)

[Outro]
So crazy
Crazy about, about you
So crazy
You want to be my girl, I'll be your man
So crazy
Drive me out my mind, crazy, crazy
So crazy
I'm so crazy...
