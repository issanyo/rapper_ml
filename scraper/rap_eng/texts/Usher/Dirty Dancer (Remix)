[Intro: Enrique Iglesias & Usher]
Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go!
Dirty, dirty dancer

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
Another day, another night
And she acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me
Listen!

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you get it up

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias, Usher & Both]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only

[Verse 2: Usher]
It’s a game (ha) that she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It’s insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal
Yeah, yeahhh

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you give it up

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias, Usher & Both]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
(Never be her only)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Hello baby, it’s Weezy Baby
It’s going down, depreciating
Okay now I don’t dance, unless we dancing dirty
Skinny leather pants, I’m on my Eddie Murphy
Shawty shake it fast like she in a hurry
I like the full glass, and I like my Mary Bloody
If she ain’t doing you, then you ain’t doing nothing
And ain’t no money, like Young Money

[Post-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Usher]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
C'mon!

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias, Usher & Both]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only, never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
