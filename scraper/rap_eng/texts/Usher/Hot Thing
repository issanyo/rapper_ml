[Intro: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?

[Verse 1: Usher]
Shawty got a body that jeans can't hold
And she moving like she learned everything from the pole
And she loves to party, number one hobby
Out till the morning, better ask somebody
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She's a girl from the future
Says she's sick and tired of the old
So all that old shit can hit the road
Man, you only know if you know
'Cause she's...

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it? (oh, damn)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing (she's so bubblicious)
What’s up with it?

[Verse 2: Usher]
Seen her at Laser and she stopped and posed
When she see the green one, she just go, go, go
Like a stolen Bugatti, got money in your pocket
That makes you a Willy Parker pop up when he got a body
Talk to the girl while he's around
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She says you must have money in your wallet till the thing don't fold
Unless his credit card's black, not gold
Now you only know if you know
For real

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a)
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it? (hot thing)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing (it's better when it's bubblicious)
What’s up with it?

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Fly, young hot thing, girl, let me cool off
GQ status went and fucked me with my suit on
She a fashion killer and you know I am a shoe hog
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms give me blue balls
She fuck me like she know me, then fuck me like she owe me
She told me, then she showed me, then she cuddled like she lonely
All for the love of the Holy Matrimony
But I'm pretty like Tony, and I'm pimping like Goldie
How you doing? I'm the motherfucking man
True hot boy, catch me running with the flame
She a hot girl, so she running with the name
Drop, drop it like it's hot, on my motherfucking thing
Mami like a lotta, Papi like the Murcielago
Grada, riding down Mercer
Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh
If you let me menage, I'll take you to see Usher

[Bridge: Usher]
Talk to the girl while he's around (gotta talk to her, man)
Watch will happen to you when she hear sound (hey, when she hear that sound)
Tell her shake it up, tell her hit the ground (shake it up, let me see you drop down low)
Gonna FaceTime, see if she's down
She said, “It don’t really take too much to get me out of control
Maybe you the star, but this my show
Just take a little and I’m good to go"
Yeah, man
You fucking with a...

[Chorus: Usher]
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing (she's a hot thing)
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
(I like them girls with the bubblicious without a man)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
(Ain’t gotta have a lot just for me to hold on to fuck)
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
Hot thing
What’s up with it?
