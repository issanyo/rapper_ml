[Intro]
Oh no, no, no, no, no, oh baby

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Verse 1]
Keep it on a cutie girl cause I'm really into you, yeah
Tell me, is there a way that i can spend some time with you?
So much I wanna know about you
Seems like I can't do without you
You really turn me on, you got it going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Anything you ask, I'll do for you
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
Just one thing I have to know
Baby, can I make it right?

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Verse 2]
As I'm looking into your eyes, all I see is your lovely face
And there's nothing I like more than to show you I adore
The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little things you say
Baby, when I kiss your lips, it really brightens up my day

[Pre-Chorus]
Anything you ask, I'll do for you
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
Just one thing I have to know
Baby, can I make it right?

[Chorus]
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Bridge]
So baby, don't you see you mean the world to me?
If you just swing my way
I'll make it right
So tell me, where do we go from here?
I'll make it right
There's nowhere that we can go, but take it nice and slow
Baby enjoy the flow
Lots of pleasures I can give, I've got it waiting here
So put away your fears

[Chorus]
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right
Baby, you know that I can make it right
I'll make it right

[Outro]
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you (I'll make it right)
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you
So much I wanna know about you
Seem like I can't live without you (I'll make it right)
So much...
