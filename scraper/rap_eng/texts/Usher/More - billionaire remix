Watch me as I dance under the spotlight-
Listen to the people screaming out more and more
'Coz I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can
Feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, the winner
Best when under pressure with second's left I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Get up both your hands, I'm in the zone, tight!
Put 'em in the air, if you want more (and) more
Cos I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop then just know that imma bring it back
Never quittin' on believin' that

Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can
Feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, the winner
Best when under pressure with second's left I show up

If you really want more, scream it out louder
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

(Vocal segment x2)
Whoa oh oh oh whoa oh
(above x3)
Push it to the limit, give it more!

If you really want more, scream it out louder
Get it on the floor, bring out the fire
And light it up, take it up higher
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more

Whoa oh oh oh whoa oh
(above x3)
Gonna push it to the limit, give it more
