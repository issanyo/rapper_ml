[Verse 1: Usher]
Said it ain’t what you do cause
(Everybody knows what's up cause everybody wanna get next to me)
Said if you knew what I do, she’ll be yours tonight
Imagine she came here to get away
Well she don’t want nobody crowding her space
Wouldn’t that be weird? Aw yeah
She was up tonight to get down
But she don’t wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn’t that be weird? Aw yeah

[Pre-Hook: Usher]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Hook: Usher]
Said It ain't what you do, its what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she’ll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cause , you're here to have a good time

[Verse 2: Usher]
So many benefits to to being quiet, just be cool enjoy the ride
‘Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn’t that be weird? Yeah
Don’t be stingy with it pass the J, let her hit it if it’s headed her way
My nigga, that’s weird
(You don't let her hit it, you don't let her hit it)

[Pre-Hook: Usher]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Hook: Usher]
Said It ain't what you do, its what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she’ll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cause, you're here to have a good time

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who, get the worm it's the early bird
Flow, slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these niggas like Sterly Sterl
I seen him in the club, he could get the cub
I ain't talking about baseball, but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ, and forget your glove
I'm tryna get faded nigga, go and get the drugs
Five plus five, what they call that? Ten
Out in Japan, we be counting that, Yen
Ladies, who you trying to get it popping with? Men
No little boys, in the circle of Usher, got'em under pressure
When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man, play the back, like a spine
He only last six seconds, like a Vine

[Pre-Hook: Usher]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Hook: Usher]
Said It ain't what you do, its what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut, to doing something right
If you knew what I knew, she’ll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cause , you're here to have a good time

[Break: Usher & (Pharrell)]

(Come on)
Just start something
(She's trying, to give it to you)

(Laughs)
