Here I lay all alone
Tossin', turnin'
Longin' for some of your
Tender love
I've waited for the right
Moment to come
So I can thank you for
All the tender love you've given to me
Tender love
Love so tender
Holding me close to you
Baby, I surrender
Candle stand light the dark
Now I see how
Love with the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me
I watch you more and more
Can't resist you
Moving I feel your touch
Ooh, tender love
Loving me straight from the heart
Hold me nearer
Please let me be a part
All the tender love you've given to me
Tender love
Love so tender
Holding me close to you
Baby, I surrender, yeah
Baby, I surrender, baby
Ooh, yeah
Tender love
Keep it coming
A love that we both share
Keep it coming
I never seen it nowhere
Keep it coming
Keep it coming
So tender, tender, tender, tender, tender love
Tender love
Love you for love, you know I'll never leave
'Cause all of the tender love you've given me
Just can't hide that I'm feeling free
'Cause all of the tender love you've given me
Yeah
All the tender love you've given to me
