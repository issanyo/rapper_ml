F there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans of love
Baby, I've been making plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

My sincerest apologies, I mean it
I'll admit it, all being pathetic
I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail
Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more
I'm wrong
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though

(realest shit I ever wrote?
(realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)

I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I probably be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the flaws
Brush you off, yeah I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's
I'M DARK, GOOD NIGGA, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady SHIT got too dark
I'M SORRY. And I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, ON flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions
But, I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though
