Shouldn't there be a place where nothing is naughty?
Shouldn’t there be a place where anything goes?
Where "shouldn't" and "can't" and "don’t"
And "mustn't" and "ought" evaporate
And fun's the only biz? Guess what!
[RINGLEADER/wRoustabouts]
There is!

Pleasure Island
Pleasure Island
It's that "What's for supper?
Candy, cake, and pie " land
[RINGLEADER]
See that window? Why not break it
See that toy there? I'll just take it
And you'll never have a lesson
Or a chore to do
Rules and limits (Kiss!)
Kiss goodbye-land (Mwah!)
Pleasure Island
Welcomes you


[RINGLEADER/wRoustabouts]
Wouldn't you like to play and party forever?
Wouldn’t you like to fight and frolic and fuss?
To stomp on the mud and get real dirty never apologize?
If that’s your sort of thing, then sing with us

See that window? Let's go break it
See that toy there? We'll just take it

Pleasure Island

[RINGLEADER (Roustabouts)]
Wouldn't you like an extra scary adventure?
Wouldn't you like this special sort of a thrill? (You bet!)
The kind of a ride to scream and holler and clench your eyes real tight
(Tense your eyes real tight)
A scare than you'll admit. Well this, this is it!

Pleasure Island
Pleasure Island
"Every dare you ever dreamed
You get to try" land (Hey!)
Does it scare ya?
[ROUSTABOUT]
Do you fear it?
[ROUSTABOUT]
Double dare ya!
[ROUSTABOUT]
That's the spirit!
[RINGLEADER]
You're no chicken, though you may find out
If that is to be
[ALL]
As we leave you
With a smile and
Displeasure Island
