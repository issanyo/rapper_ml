Man I didn't know that you where talking about her
So man your telling me you know her
I know her like a pastor know his word

[Chorus]
We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
How could the love of my life, and my potential wife be the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I can't believe that we've been messing with the
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up it on us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

[Verse 2]
See I met her at this party in Atlanta
Well I met her at this party in Chicago
She came right up to me given me conversation
I said do you got a man she sad no, with no hesitation
Well it must be a music thing 'cause she said the same to me
With a party all in my face, when I'm laughin' and buyin' her drinks

And she whispered in my ear and said can you take me home
Me too
Man she was in the Chi singin' that same song
Is that true
And I thought it was true confession when she said
I love you
Man I thought her body was calling when she said
I want you
Look I even got some pictures on my phone
Look at there how she's is with some boys shorts on

[Chorus]
We messing with the same girl (same girl) same girl
She's the apple of my eye, and my potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Man I just can't believe that we've been messing around with the same damn girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
Thought she was someone that I can trust
But she's been doubling up with both of us
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl

[Bridge]
Said she got me on ringtone
Are you talking about the pink phone
Mm-mm the blue one
Man she told me that one was turned off
It's obvious that she's been playing us playing us
Or constantly she's been lyin to us lyin to us
Don't like the way that she's been goin bout it goin bout it
Kels what do you think that we should do about it do about it
Well call her up at her home, she won't know that I'm on the phone
Yeah man that's the way
Homie we about to bust this trick
Man just ask her to met up with you and I'm gonna show up too
And she won't know what to do
Well be standing there singing

[Chorus]
Same girl (same girl) same girl
She's was the apple of my eye, and your potential wife
Same girl (same girl) same girl
I just no can't believe that we've been messing with the same girl
Same girl (same girl) same girl
She gonna be lookin so stupid when she see us together
You can't, man we've been messing with the same girl
See she was taken flights going back and forth
I would pick her up at the Airport
Man I really can't believe it (Same girl same girl same girl)
Oh can't believe it no
Hey'. The same girl (same girl) the same girl
