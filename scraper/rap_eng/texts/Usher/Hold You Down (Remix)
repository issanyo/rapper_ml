[Intro: Usher & DJ Khaled]
I'll hold you remix (this the remix)
I'll hold you remix
You are, you are
Be sure you got a rider beside you to hold you down (DJ Khaled!)

[Verse 1: Usher]
I'll hold you down (We the best music), I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power huh
So I found her, fly shit to jump up out her
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter

[Chorus: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire (ah)
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors (what)
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone? (ah)
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change
Trap star, two bricks in the match box
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top (wah)
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White (right)
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?

[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Bridge: Usher]
[I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you)
I'll hold you remix now (huh)
I'm on my way (we the best at holding it down) to hold you down]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
We the best
Yeah, we the best at holding it down
She said he don't hold her down right
Some day she'll be done with him
I say there's 7 days in the week, some day ain't one of them
You gotta know your worth, baby, don't give 'em no discount
All of mine are dime, you see a nine, it was a miscount
And I'm the one to tell a bitch to bounce
I'm the one who getting this amount
I'm the one with this foreign shit
Name still getting mispronounced
Hold up, who you held down? When you ever put bail down?
I'mma keep picking money up like the motherfucker fell down
It's an us versus y'all thing, we a small gang
Just the two of us, baby, but we all bang
Bang, bang, bang like what set you claim
And when they asked me that, baby, you know I said your name

[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Bridge: Usher]
[I'll hold you remix (I'll hold you, I'll hold you)
I'll hold you remix now (huh)
I'm on my way  to hold you down]

[Verse 4: Ace Hood]
Keys to the whip, key to the mansion
I fuck you while counting money, I'm just that romantic
See we be Bonnie and Clyde and I keep that heat like Udonis
And if it ever go down I know you won't snitch to your honor
That's why you draped in designer, Chanel and all kind of shit
She with the realest and all 'em lames are too counterfeit
It's been a long time and she's still holding me down
(This the remix)
Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)
I have been through hell, had ups and downs
But in the long run still here
I apologize for when I be talking that freak shit in the air
She still moaning, I know you want it, I go to switching that gear
On everything, she never changed for real
That's why

[Hook: Usher]
There goes my baby
Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down
Now

[Bridge: Usher]
[I'll hold (you smart) you remix  (I'll hold you, I'll hold you)
(you loyal) I'll hold you remix now (you grateful)
I'm on my way (I appreciate that) to hold you down] (you a genius)

I'll hold you down (I'll hold you, I'll hold you down)
I'm on my way to hold you down (another one)
Hold on uh yeah uh
I'll hold you remix, yeah
I'll hold you, I'll hold you
I'll hold you remix (hold you down)
