[Verse 1]
I've been looking at you turning brothers down
Some got their song, well, it's time for me to holler now
(Your body is calling, don't fight it)
Ooh, I like it
You're dancing alone, what's that all about?
You're so fine, but it's time for me to call you out
(Watch out, I'll straight run up on you)
Girl I want you

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on

[Verse 2]
Dancing so close, got me up like, "whoa!"
We're doing the most, Is leaving with you possible?
(Your body is saying you want to)
And I want you
More than you know, sugar, if only for one night
I'll make you feel like you've been to paradise
(It's all up to you, tell me something, baby)
I know one thing

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on

[Bridge]
Baby, tell me, what's on your mind?
Do you think that I'm being too forward?
Ooh baby, by coming at you this way
I can't help myself, you're...

[Chorus]
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Having visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot if you say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Visions of making love tonight
With you constantly to the break of dawn
We can shake the spot... say it's on
You're the hottest thing in the club tonight
Visions of... love tonight
Constantly... break of dawn
Shake the spot... say it's on
