[Verse 1]
Do I remind you of the pain
That he put you through, girl?
Is that the reason I'm to blame
Before I do it?
Is it because he treated you badly
I always stand accused?
Protecting yourself from somebody else
I'm not who's hurting you, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

[Verse 2]
He left a scar across your heart
I understand, girl
Don't let his wrongs tear us apart
'Cause girl, I'm your man
Just because he did, you swear I'm cheating
You think I just don't care
Why must I do time for another man's crime?
Girl, you know that ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, knowing
You compare me to him
Always guilty before the sin
I can't win, no, I can't win

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes

[Bridge]
I know he did you wrong
But tell me, what does that have to do with me?
Trying to show you something real
Figure out what is going on
Before you look up and I'll be gone

[Chorus]
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
[I love you, and I love you, I love you
I'll do anything to prove I love you
Baby girl, but I refuse to
Pay for something I didn't do, girl
I love you, girl
But I refuse to stay
Paying for his mistakes
