[Intro]
Usher, baby
I'm alone in this room
The only thing that's on my mind is you
I can't lie and say that I don't hear your call at night
Got something for you
Got plenty to go around
I guess I gotta remind you how I put it down

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all, love them all

[Verse 1]
There's enough for me to go around up in this club, yeah
And there's enough for me to make sure I pleasure all these girls in this club, yeah
I'm gonna make sure it's fair
Gonna do you, you and you and you and then I'm gonna do her
Okay, let's get it straight, all my ladies get in line, yeah
I'ma take you back to school
Just raise your hand, girl, if you want me to get to you

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Verse 2]
These girls are gonna hate me if I give too much attention to one girl, yeah
So I might just have to double up, no, triple up, to make it through these girls, yeah
You kiss me here, touch me there, you move over, bring her here
All aboard, get up on this plane
I got a 747 kind of love, girl
And I can take you all over the world

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Verse 3]
Now usually, I'm a one-kind-of-girl kind of guy
Now, I'ma free-to-get-at-every-girl kind of guy
And if you down for that (I'm down)
Say, put me down for that (put me down)
I don't think you really hear me, baby
Let me break it down
'Cause lately I've been an all-up-in-love kind of guy
But now I'm a single-to-beat-it-up kind of guy
And if you down for that (I'm down)
Say, put me down for that (put me down)
Raise your hands in the air
If you want Usher, yeah

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Outro]
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
