Oh my god, I see you clearly now
In my dreams you?re here with me somehow
Call my name and I won?t make a sound
I?m in love with someone out of town

Who is this stranger
I should be scared, could be dangerous
I should prepare for this
I wish I didn?t fall so hard for you

You walk by but you don?t see me
Slow motion and so gracefully
Be my friend and I?ll show you around
I?m in love with someone out of town

Who is this stranger
I should be scared, could be dangerous
I should prepare for this
I wish I didn?t fall so hard for you
