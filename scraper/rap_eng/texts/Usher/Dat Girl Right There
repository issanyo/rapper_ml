Yo, rich

That girl right there, yeah, look at her
Watch what she do right here
You know, you know
That girl right there, she gaming
That girl right there, yeah
Listen, I been from shorty to shorty
From the nice girls to naughty ones
Coming up short, straining my throat
Trying tell them just what I want then I saw you
And I knew you wouldn't playing no
Hey, hey, I, I, I forgot all the skinny model
Chicks Ive dropped check it, when I did it they get it
They try to flip it for me to hit it but I only want you
And girl I ain't even playing no, hey, I said
You
(The only one I want)
You
(The only one I need)
You
(The only one I see)

Oh, you
(The only one I wanna chill)
Oh, you
(Girl, give it all to me)

That girl right there
With the big door Nobbie earrings on
That girl right there
With her stomach all out, she got me gone
That girl with lip tattoo
That girl right there
(That girl right there)
I need you right here
(I need you right here)
That girl right there, there, there
Yeah, right there, oh

No, no, no
Yeah, right there
I, I all these diamonds, all up in this watch
But I'm looking at you, wind it up, no, not you
Can't keep it hot, the little tattoo right above your butt
My ride's right outside looking so cold
(Come see it, girl)
I know you know but you don't wanna be alone
(No, no, no, no, no)
So come on let me show you
(The only one I want)
Oh, you

Oh, you

That girl right there
With the big door Nobbie earrings on
That girl right there
With her stomach all out, she got me gone
That girl with lip tattoo
That girl right there

I need you right here
(I, I need you right here)
That girl right there, there, there
Yeah, right there
Yeah, right there, na, na, na
Yeah, right there
That girl right there
With the little tattoo right above her
Thigh, thigh, thigh, thigh, thigh
Pierced belly button pretty toes
And the light brown eyes
Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Like yeast in the oven, all of the sudden
She made me rise, rise, rise, rise, rise
Can't get her off my mind
Got Luda like why, why, why, why
Sexy lady got me gone
Never thought that it can happen to a pimp
But I bet she was plotting all along
She the one that should be working with a limp
Or a cane 'cause her game is extra strong
But she better watch her back
'Cause in fact my plan of attack in sack
Or the back of the lac with the yack is extra long
All my ladies so, so fine
But in my heart Ive made up my mind
'Cause everything that you
(Wear)
The way that you fixin' your
(Hair)
Gotta keep on acting keep
(Playing)
Keep making your boy say
That girl right there
With the big door Nobbie earrings on
That girl right there
With her stomach all out, she got me gone
That girl with lip tattoo
That girl right there
(That girl right there)
I need you right here
(I need you right here)
That girl right there, there, there
Yeah, right there
Yeah, right there
No, no, no
Yeah, right there
Dip slow, let it roll
All the way down to the floor
That girl she janglin'
That girl she janglin'
Dip slow, let it roll
All the way down to the floor
Watch her, she janglin'
That girl she janglin'
