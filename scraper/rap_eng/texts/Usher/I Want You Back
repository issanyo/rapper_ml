Real talk, Usher, just blaze, you know
Oh, oh
(You, you're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You know you're gonna need me)
And now that day's here, you man gotta shed tears, right
(You're gonna want me back)
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally I realize that I need you
I want you back, baby girl I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man I wish I woulda kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
Aw baby, what you say now?
(You're gonna want me back)
And still I want you, want you
Want you, want you, want you, need you, babe
If I could rewind the time
And get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
(You're gonna want me back)
I didn't see it, I couldn't see what I was doin', babe
See baby girl I was blind
And I wish I could try
To be the man that you deserve
(You're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work
Ah, baby, you're driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
Oh, I just wish I could find you girl, oh I
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now, oh
(You're gonna want me back)
Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
(You're gonna need me)
Oh, oh
(You're gonna want me back)
Give me one chance to make it work
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby
I'm goin' outta my mind, I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl, oh baby
Said I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby
It's driving me crazy
'Cause I'm missing my baby, yeah
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my mind and I'm runnin' outta time
I just wish I could find you girl
So I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needin' you lately
(You're gonna want me back)
I'm goin' outta my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now
(You're gonna want me back)
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
(You're gonna need me, need me one day)
And that day's here
(You're gonna want me back)
And ya man gotta shed tears, I'm sittin' by the phone
Realizing she ain't ever coming home
(Oh, ooh, you're gonna need me, need me one day)
