[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Is there a reason why our love could not last?
I ask, was it too strong for you to hold on, pretty lady?
I thought we had a master plan
But it takes a stronger man to walk away
Than to watch our love fade away

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I often wonder how and why
I did not cheat, I did not lie
I hope you know how hard I tried
But it's over for now, it's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can't believe how suddenly things change
Yesterday, we were in love but all I feel were heartaches and pain
Day and night, I tried deep inside to work things out
But in my heart, I knew I still had my doubts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I thought we made a symphony
It's over now, no more harmony
I prayed so hard for love to fly
It's time to say goodbye

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Bridge]
Sorry I gotta leave
Baby, I'm begging, please

[Chorus]
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's over now, it's time to say goodbye

[Outro]
Bye bye, baby
