By the end of the night
You're gonna leaving with me for sure
And by the end of the night
You're gon' be screaming for more, oh-ho

One step, two step that body to me
Unlock your love and I'll set you free
And if the feeling is right
We could get freaky for life, oh-ho

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight
Oh god, you've been looking so good tonight
I wanna see how you move tonight
Oh god, all the things we could do tonight

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh

I see the look in your eyes
I know I got what you need for sure
If wanting you is a crime
Then I don't wanna be right, oh-no

One step, two step your feeling on me
Take me on, boy
Give it to me
I love the look in your eyes
We could get freaky for life, oh-ho

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight
Oh god, you've been looking so good tonight
I wanna see how you move tonight
Oh god, all the things we could do tonight

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh

You're all I'm thinking of
You're all I wanna touch
I need more, can't get enough
Gotta put it on somebody
Ah, bring your body (2x)

(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame
(And oh)
Your body is to blame, body is to blame

I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
I just wanna love you in every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh
I've been thinking 'bout you everyday
On top, don't stop
Do it every way
Only one to start to make you say
Eh, eh, eh, eh

I've been thinking 'bout you tonight, oh girl
By the end of the night
You're gonna leaving with me for sure
