[Verse]
That night I said I was recording late
I wasn't recording late
I was just smoking, chilling, had a couple drinks
Not much of anything
And that time I flew down to the MIA
Then I went MIA
I hit up KOD with a few bands to play (hold up)
And that ain't everything
All I think about is bitches, umm
And everywhere I go they come
Double standards let everybody talk 'bout it (shit)
The tables turned around, I be throwing up six
So I ain't trying to justify
All I do
So tired of lying
All I do
All I do
