[Verse:]
I pull up at the light and see you looking my way {ho! }
I lay back in my seat and think of some pimp shit to say
It's been a while since one look
Made me feel this way
And I don't intend to let you go, no {come on, come on}

[Bridge:]
And baby I can't wait (I can't wait)
To show you all around the world {say what, say what huh huh}
Oh girl oh girl {so put it in the water! }
I got what what you need (oh)

[Chorus:]
Baby I can give you everything you need (every-thing that you need) {huh huh huh yeah}
Just trust your man and let me do me (let me do me baby)
I wanna take you places you only see on tv (oh oh oh girl)
Oh oh oh girl I got just what you need (yeah I got what you need) {come on}

[Verse 2:]
I gotta make a move before the light tries to change {oh}
I let down my window and tell you to just follow me {un-huh, un-huh, un-huh}
I know you wanna come but you seem a little afraid
Trust me (trust me)
Say I promise I won't hurt you baby {here we go, here we go}

[Bridge:]
I can't wait (I can't wait yeah) {uh huh}
To show you all around the world (all around the world) {one more time, one more time}
Oh girl oh girl
Feels so good I wanna say it again yeah
And baby I can't wait (ohh)
To show you all around the world {huh huh huh huh}
Ooo girl Oh girl {so shake what you got}
I got what what you need (oh)

[Chorus:]
Baby I can give you everything you need (everything that you need) {huh huh huh yeah}
Just trust your man and let me do me (let me do me baby)
I wanna take you places you only see on tv (places you only see on tv)
Oh oh oh girl
I got just what you need {heh heh heh} (just what you need)

Oh!
Baby I can give you everything that you need (every-thing that you need) {say what}
Just trust your man and let me do me (let me do me baby) {uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh}
