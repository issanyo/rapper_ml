[Intro]
That last hour was the worst
When we remember forever
Lesson and a curse

[Chrous]
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first
Could've left off from better terms
If we could fall back one more hour
Daylight Savings
Like Daylight Savings
If we could revist that moment again
I would never let us in that way
Like Daylight Savings
Like Daylight Savings
If we could fall back one more hour
I watch time slip away
Like you love with no grip, that's right
Seen blue skies fed to gray, oh
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first
Could have left off from better terms
Wish we could fall back one more hour
Daylight Savings
Like Daylight Savings
If we could revist that moment again
I would never let us in that way
Like Daylight Savings
Like Daylight Savings
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we could've focused on each other first
Could've left off from better terms
Wish we could fall back one more hour
Like Daylight Savings
Like Daylight Savings
If we could fall back one more hour

[Outro]
Daylight Savings, ah, ha
Daylight Savings
Wish I could go back, ah, ha
