[Intro]
I'm saying, I care
But it's like you don't hear me
What more could I do?

[Verse 1]
Girl, you can keep that
Trying to make me jealous
I admit that I've been careless
But we can't take back what's done
I know why you did that
You're frustrated 'cause I don't react
Maybe you want some feedback
'Cause normally my feelings don't show
But baby...

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, I care for you

[Verse 2]
Every day, I'm
Trying to prove myself to you
But what's the point?
No such thing is satisfying you
Maybe you'll appreciate it later By the time I'm gone
Better get your act together, don't wait too long
Don't wanna change what we have to what we had
Girl, I need you to know that I...

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you
I, I, I, I care
I, I, I, girl, I care for you, I do

[Bridge]
Gotta believe it, gotta believe it
I care
Gotta believe it, gotta believe it
Gotta believe it
I care, I care
You know I care
I care, I care
You know I care, I really do

[Chorus]
I care for you
By now you should now that I care for you
You say my actions never show it
I don't wear my heart on my sleeve
But what you get's what you see
The truth is, girl, underneath
Gotta believe that I care for you
Baby, I care for you

[Outro]
Now, listen, hear me
I care, I care, I care for you
