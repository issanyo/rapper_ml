[Mr. Cheeks]
Yea, Mr. Cheeks, Mr. Saks
Usher, the remix
It sounds like a winner to me
Ok
You remind me of this chik I used to deal wit
Hang out and chill wit, smoke and eat a meal wit
Cop the rings-n-things, took her to the Ruckers games
I'm findin out cuz it ain't nothin but some other mothafucka's names
Neva thought that she was grimey from the way she looked
Sex a nigga, gravy and every day she cooks
Come to find out my honey wasn't playin fair
Grab ya clothes and ya keys you ain't staying hear

[Usher]
See this girl she, sorta looks just like you
She evan smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Hook]
[Usher]
U remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I I look at you
Won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Usher]
Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooo she was sexing everyone but me
This is why we could never be

[Hook]

I know (yeah) it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew (Wish I knew how to separate the two)
U remind me (U remind)
Whoaaa Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[Cheeks]

Yea, I'm talkin
Pokin those trips, I'm lovin those hips
A hot chik's up in my corner and my dough flips
The type of chik that every cat wanna keep wit dem
She had a lot a male friends that wanna freak wit dem
I wanna hold you the way you wanna hold me
I've played the fool before I'm not trying ta O.D
And being unfair to you that's what I hate ta do
I swear I wish I had a way to seperate the two
I swear I wish I had a way to seperate the two
Yo

[Hook]

(Gotta let you go)
(Said a Iiiiiiiiiiiii huh)
(Gotta let you go)

[Hook]

You remind me of a girl yeah)
(hey oh oh)
(You wouldn't believe it)
(This is why I just can't get with you no no)

[Hook] till end
