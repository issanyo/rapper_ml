[Intro]
I can't stop, won't stop
Usher, baby
Yeah, will you do it again?
Can't stop, won't stop

[Chorus]
Hey, what's up?
This is a jam, turn it up
Play it loud in the club
There's this fire, you're burning me up
Oh, girl, yeah, girl
I've been looking around the world
And right when I saw you, I fell in love
And I want you forever and ever and ever
'Cause I can't, can't stop it, I can't, can't stop it
I can't, can't stop it, I can't stop, won't stop
Can't, can't stop it, I can't, can't stop it
I can't, can't stop it, I can't stop, won't stop

[Verse 1]
Can't stop won't stop
Girl, you are my sugar shop
Love you like a lollipop
From the bottom to the top
I'ma get you wet, raincoat
Let me be your body soap
Up and down, roller-coaster
We can love forever
You can call me papa
You my freaky mama
Mami, be my doctor
Work on my body, girl
Oh yeah, right now, operate on me whenever
You're my sexy operator

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop now, you can't stop now
We can't stop now, why stop now?
Don't stop now, but keep it going, now
Rock it on out, can't stop, won't stop

[Chorus]
Hey, what's up?
This is a jam, turn it up
Play it loud in the club
There's this fire, you're burning me up
Oh, girl, yeah, girl
I've been looking around the world
And right when I saw you, I fell in love
And I want you forever and ever and ever
'Cause I can't, can't stop it, I can't, can't stop it
I can't, can't stop it, I can't stop, won't stop
Can't, can't stop it, I can't, can't stop it
I can't, can't stop it, I can't stop, won't stop

[Verse 2]
You came here, won't quit
Girl, you are the shit
I know that you freaky, girl
I keep your secret shit
Them other ladies don't mean nothing
You're my favorite chick
I don't like them groupie hoes
They be on my dick
You can call me big daddy
Let me call you all the time
Let me make you laugh
Take them problems off your mind
'Cause I don't wanna do all the normal things
That all these other normal dudes do

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop now, you can't stop now
We can't stop now, why stop now?
Don't stop now, but keep it going, now
Rock it on out, can't stop, won't stop

[Chorus]
Turn it up
Whole place is on fire
Burn it up
I've looking around the world now (stop it)
Saw you, I saw your face girl (stop it, stop it)
(I can't stop, won't stop)
I can't stop it now (stop it, stop it)
(Stop it, I can't stop, won't stop)
