[Intro: Usher]
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss
Y'all niggas will never learn
Yeah, Usher, baby
You can't really fuck with me
This club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Verse 1: Usher]
I know you wanna leave with me
You wanna be seen with me
I can't lie, girl, you fine as hell
And I might let you be with me
I know you wanna come with me
Come take a ride with me
Can't be shy, girl
'Least not tonight, girl

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Break: Usher]
I say hey, you, get in my car
Get in my car, you know you wanna roll

[Verse 2: Usher]
Is that your girl looking at me?
Be clear where y'all wanna be
Me on you, her on me
If you feeling free, we can do it three (just playing)
Put all the clothes up
Girl, go make your mind up
Get you back to the crib with your feet up
Make love till it's kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
Club is crowded we should go
Telly got rooms, but I got more
Room ain't enough
Come on, baby girl, that's what's up (that's what's up)
One, one more drink and we ready to cut
You tugging my front I'm squeezing your butt
If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
What you gonna do, girl?
Just know that I can have anyone and you if I choose
And I choose you, I choose you

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]

The door lift up and it lay back down when it push
Back start and it hit one mile when the bar shut down
And it's no more drinking I know how ya feelin know

If you ain't gone finish, don't start no stuff (I just wanna touch) Don't start no stuff

[Chorus: Usher]
There's too many women here to waste all my time on you
