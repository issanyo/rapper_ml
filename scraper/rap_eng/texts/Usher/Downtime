[Verse 1]
Everything you do is everything I know
No need to pretend, we both know what you want
Say you gotta good thing, he don't have to know
Everything you and I do, only I know it
We could make this easy
I know you don't need me, this ain't that kind of thing
It's more of a fling
That's why when you leave

[Chorus]
I donâ€™t want no one coming through
Don't act like it's part of you
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Left the country just to spend the weekend here to fuck me
What is not the only thing that's coming
All your friends are calling you
Like "OMG your such and such is lucky"
It's touching my soul
But little does anyone know, yeah
I've been working, I ain't perfect
I don't need you to tell me "it's yours"
You know what it is I adore
And something about it that inspires me to hit it more
You told me you coming, well shit I'll just buzz you in
Keys are still under the mat by the door
Ignore the mess
My crib ain't the cleanest from company I had the evening before, yeah

[Chorus]
I ain't the only one coming through
Don't act like it's part of you
What I do in my downtime
Is what I do in my downtime
We connect, we wanna feel
That shit don't have no meaning
But what you do in your downtime
Is what you do in your downtime
That's everything I know
Girl that's everything I know
Yeah, yeah, that's everything I know
That's the only thing I know

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
