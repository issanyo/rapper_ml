Oh-ho, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no

[Verse 1]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you ain't really knew
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that this is what I found
And everyone of y'all are just like me, yeah
It's too bad that you can't see that you've got it

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
And you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, she's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
And you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody
You got it bad

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ho, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm, I'm taken by the thought of this

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it

[Chorus]
So then it's all because of you
Said it's all because of you
Said it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
She's the sweetest drug
