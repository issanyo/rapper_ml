[Verse 1]
First, see the city skylights shining from my room
You're such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon's reflection when
It's passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say, "It's been a long time"
I say, "Okay-kay-kay, don't worry, I got you"
Do you say, "How 'bout some foreplay?"
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do you say, "Play some slow ones"
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye, too
To love you gently

[Chorus]
Let me love you gently
Lay back, relax, girl I'ma be
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
'Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

[Verse 2]
See, I know just when to finish and I know just when to start
And I'll be loving your reaction everytime I hit that spot
But it's soft like leather, but the top is hard
Whisper your pleasures, then I'll do my job
Invigorating, intense, girl, let me do what I do
I don't know what's echoing louder, the music or you
I ain't close to be done yet, but you're getting real warm
Like the calm of the thunder right after the storm
Do you say, you say, do you say it, girl?
Gonna push it to the limit
It's yours, It's yours
See, second place or win the race, I'm gonna be your number one
Till the sun shines
Here comes the sun
Forever more
Let's try and taste the moon again, forever more

[Chorus]
Let me love you gently
That's the sound of love, ripping shades off the wall
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
This might not be in the bedroom, but I'm gonna love you, girl, gently
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Let me touch you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather, but hard as a rock

[Outro]
Can you feel me, girl?
We don't need no room
All we need is me and you
Wanna love you
