I just wanna party tonight
Somewhere crazy, lose myself in the lights
I just wanna go there tonight
Somewhere different, lose myself in the life

Yeah Usher baby

(We can)
Take a private jet and hit to LA
(We can)
Hit up London and New York in the same day
(We can)
Let our face [?]
(We can)

Would u believe it
If I wanna tell ya
I'm the man who'll change your life
Would u believe
If I wanna show ya
All your dreams you chased one night

What if I told you that
You could have all this cash
Not just today or tomorrow
Right now girl, right away
The best time you've ever had
It starts and leaves with me

Would u believe it if I told you that
