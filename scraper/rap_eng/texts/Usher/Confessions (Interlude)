[Intro]
Hello? Yo, I'm in the booth
I'ma call you right back
Nah, I just gotta put this one part down
I'ma call you back
I'm at the studio, man, what...
Man, quit playing with me, man
No, for real, don't play like that
Are you, are you serious?
How you know?
Put that on everything
Damn
I'ma call you back
I'ma call you back

[Verse]
Every time I was in L.A., I was with my ex-girlfriend
Every time you called, I told you, "Baby, I'm working"
(No!) I was out doing my dirt
(Oh!) Wasn't thinking about you getting hurt
(I) was hand-in-hand in the Beverly Center like, man
Not giving a damn who sees me
So gone (I know)
So wrong (just listen)
Acting like I didn't have you sitting at home
Thinking about me
Being a good girl that you are
I bet you probably believe you got a good man
A man that never would do the things I'm about to tell you I've done
Brace yourself, it ain't good
But it would be even worse if you heard this from somebody else
(Oh no)

[Outro]
I know you hate me
I know I hurt you
But there's more
Listen
