[Intro]
Come and get
Come and get
Slow love

[Verse 1]
Lay back and relax
I've got the love you've been searching for
Ain't out for games,so can't mess with your mind
I just wanna love you and take my time (come and get)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to take it fast
Gotta make it last tonight (come and get)
Other guys like to hit and run
Baby, I'm not the one
Can't stop till you're satisfied so...

[Chorus]
Come and get some of this slow love
Ain't no need to rush, we've got all night to fly
Come and get some of this slow love
Let's just take our time and do it right

[Verse 2]
With a love like mine, no wrong can be done
'Cause I'll be lovin' you one on one (come and get)
Don't know who loves you before me
Not saying I'm a perfect man, but I'll love you perfectly (come and get)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to take it fast
Gotta make it last tonight (come and get)
Other guys like to hit and run
Baby, I'm not the one
Can't stop till you're satisfied so...

[Bridge]
Ain't gonna ask is it good to you
I know what to do with the up and down, round and round
I'm just gonna give it to you
Nice and slow, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go (come and get)
Here we go, here we go, here we go (come and get some of this)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (come and get)
Come and get it (come and get some of this good love)

[Chorus]
Come and get some of this slow love
Ain't no need to rush, we've got all night to fly
Come and get some of this slow love
Let's just take our time and do it right

[Bridge]
Ain't gonna ask is it good to you
I know what to do with the up and down, round and round
I'm just gonna give it to you
Nice and slow, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

[Chorus]
Come and get some of this slow love
Ain't no need to rush, we've got all night to fly
Come and get some of this slow love
Let's just take our time and do it right

[Outro]
Come and get
It's ready for you, baby
