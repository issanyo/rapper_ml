[Intro]
Yeah, woo!!

[Verse 1]
If you, only knew I already sized you up
Sitting next to me, looking so tough
And you're fixing your hair, running your game
Telling me I only want one thing, girl
Sincerity's what you need for now
In a while, the truth will all come out
And it's almost unfair to me
What you wanna say, baby? Ready to see

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Verse 2]
You can't get enough
Man, conversation, I can feel your touch
You losing points trying to play the role
Let's keep it cool, nonsexual
Girl, I know how you feel
But you don't want it for real
It's whatever I wanna do
You don't even know what you gotten into

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I, whatever I wanna do
It's whatever I wanna do, baby, oh
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Bridge]
It just ain't right, you're feeling so frustrated
You can't stop the feeling, the feeling is close to me
Girl, you know that everything you need is right here
So now, when we do whatever we want to, oh yeah
Whatever I want

[Chorus]
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want
It's so clear to me
It's that everyone will hear you speaking
Whatever I wanna do, it's whatever I wanna do
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever I want, I can do to you
Whatever you say, it's just giving me room
Whatever I want, baby, I can do
Whatever I want

[Outro]
Whatever I want
Whatever I want
