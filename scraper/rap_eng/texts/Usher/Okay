[Verse 1]
I can't believe my eyes
Looking at your sexy ass body
The way you do it with your hands up
I just wanna be all over
Let me rock, with you
Don't let nothing interrupt this groove
Going at it like we 'bout to
Touching all on you like youâ€™re my girl

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound okay

[Verse 2]
I see you wanna take it slow
Go on, drop it to the floor real low
You know I want you bad 'cause I been all on that ass
And you ain't looking at me sideways
And the DJ is playing the last song
And it's coming down to our last call
This slow jam is specially dedicated, what better way for the night to end?
Come on

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound okay

[Bridge]
Cars outside waiting, baby, if you're ready to roll
Now that I got you opened up
Curious of mine
To know whats on your mind, girl
Girl, we been at it so long, I can't wait
Just wanna make sure we on the same page
Come on, come on, come on
I be on some other shit when that liquor talk
And I know you...

[Chorus]
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound okay
You probably saying that's a damn shame
I don't even know your name
I know it probably won't matter tonight
'Cause you been all on me I'm like, "okay"
Suggest we take this here home
So we can make a love song
I can be the best part of you waking up
Shorty, holler at me if that sound okay
