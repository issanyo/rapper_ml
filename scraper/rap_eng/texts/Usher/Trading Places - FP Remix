I know what you're used to
We're gonna do something different tonight

Now were gonna do this thing a lil different tonight
You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride
You gonna knock, then you gonna wait
Ooh, you gonna take me on a date
Youre gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours

Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
Were trading places

Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Were trading places

I plan on waking you up to a cup of Folgers
Pancakes and eggs, I owe you breakfast in bed, oh baby
And your orange juice sitting on a coaster
Toast on the side' baby, strawberry and grape jelly

You finished, let me get that drink
Pull the curtain from the window
Time to get up, baby
Let me make this bed up, baby

Today we going shopping blowing 30 on me
Make it 60, screaming like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gonna rent a movie
You order Chinese food right before you do me
You're coming on strong, baby, let me wash my hair
She said hurry up, then get in the bed

You get on top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
Were trading places

Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Were trading places

Wash the car, I'm gonna walk the dog
Take out the trash with nothing but your t-shirt on
I'm gonna press your shirt, gonna wrinkle mine's up
In the kitchen going crazy, we don't give a what

Where you want me?
Give it to me, baby, baby, babe
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, baby, baby, yeah

You get on top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, you say you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

Now were gonna do this thing a lil different tonight
Trading places
Stay tuned for part 2, you've been me, I, I've been you
But we gonna switch this thing back, I'm a put it on your
