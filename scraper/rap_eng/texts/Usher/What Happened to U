[Verse 1]
When you give it all, you get it all
What happened to you, yeah
From the beginning, knew what I was getting But I was with it and I'll admit that
She was clear that once I got up in it
Wouldn't be easy for me to let it go
For my time, I got money, but money don't buy time
I got ahead, something got left behind
And the world is yours, just sign this dotted line
And in no time, I had

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Verse 2]
Did what I wanted, freaked all the honeys
I stayed on they mind, mind was on the money
Had whatever, whenever heartthrob forever
Black, young, and clever
When you give it all you get it all
Love would be the only reason to look, baby
But once you turn it on, you can't turn it off
But picture me complaining with all this

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Bridge]
What sense does it mean to have everything
And nothing at the same time?
Where are you?
I need you, yeah
I'm looking for you
Girl, come and share all this

[Pre-Chorus]
Money, clothes, fancy cars
Big old cribs, platinum on the wall
Seven Grammys, sold out concerts
Damn, I've been working hard
Private jets to France
Many women, I done had a ball
You can say I made it, but I'm faded

[Chorus]
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
But the issue is time we can't get back
What happened to you, yeah?
Come back
'Cause I miss you, can we go back?
What happened to you?
I'm happy for you
What happened to you?

[Outro]
Wherever you are
Things changing time
Wherever you are
Still the same old you
Wherever you are, girl
Wherever you are
I miss you
