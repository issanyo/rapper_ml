[Intro]
It's crazy
I can't believe that you
Would be the one to do
Do me like you do
Get back here, baby

[Verse 1]
When you let me have my way
I was thinking I could get it again
Baby, we could be friends if you're lonely
And then you showed me just how quick your tires could spin
You were off in the wind, tell me, where did you go?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
I should have known that you led me on, girl
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I gotta be dreaming 'cause I never felt like this before

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

[Verse 2]
Now it's raining and I'm looking over at the passenger side
Thinking back in my mind how you set me off
She was stopping and dropping me, switching from fast to slow
But that had nothing on how you got when I got you home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you left, I'm thinking, "Which way did she go?"
The way you touched yourself had me up the wall
I'm in the wind on cruise control
I'm searching for you 'cause I can't seem to let you go

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?

[Interlude]
You know
I really only thought
That this would be a one night stand
What you doing to me?
Come on
What you doing to me?

[Bridge]
Maybe she's running home to someone else
Or maybe she lost my number in her cell
Or maybe she's run it down like this before
'Cause I can't see her not coming back for more, more

[Chorus]
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
But she's got me sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her
It was supposed to be just the one night
In and out and I'm out the door
So why am I sitting here at the red light
Driving 'round, looking out for her?
