[Intro: Jay-Z]
I mean...
Ush, is this what it comes to man?
This how we gon' do it?
I mean, even grass grow, baby, you know?
Seeds become plants, boys become men
What we gon' do? Let's lead the way

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Uh, wrapped around all girls like Pashminas
What's my demeanor? The grass is always greener
On the other side, there's bigger lies, can't give a ring up
I couldn't give a fuck, how could I give a finger?
Let alone half bath and closets
So claustrophobic, in fear of close objects
Now it's sort of like two-car garages
It's like two broads menagin', you're the best, mama

[Verse 2: Usher]
Is there any chance that you remember me being more than just a horrible man?
And would you consider pulling this trigger and taking a second shot at romance? Aw baby
I groomed the days when you were my girl
And I was your man, though I took you for granted
But it wasn't 'til now I see...

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
How much I missed you
Girl, I'm sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Verse 3: Usher]
Remember Mimi or Vita? Remember Iesha or Eva? I ain't got them no more
Hey, it's for Naomi and Jenny, the same outcome as Chilli, girl, I let them all go
No more tricking and kissing miscellaneous chicks acting like a jerk
Woman, I've been to church and I talked to the bishop
And he wanted me to share this with you

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
How much I missed you
I'm so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool
But for once, here goes the truth
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Momma try to told me, "Hovi Hov to slow it down
You gon' lose your best thing if you keep getting 'round"
Like Pop need a partner when you old to hold you down
Ma, forever young, was forever numb
Sorry Staci, sorry Dawn, Amil-lion and all of them
All of them was for their time, it wasn't you, it was him
School me once, school me twice, three times, I was dumb
Now it's so plain to see to me I got the one
You're the best, mama

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I can't be fake, I can't be phony
Acting all hard, that's for homies that's lonely
I try to flex, but I confess
That when you left, you took the very best thing

[Chorus: Usher]
The best thing that ever happened to me
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever seen
You took the best thing
The best thing that I ever had
And now all I feel is stress
'Cause, baby, when you left, you took the very best
