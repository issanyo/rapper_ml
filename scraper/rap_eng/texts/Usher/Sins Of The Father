Please forgive me!
What now, I think this woman's waiting for a...
What now, why I let her go and put that s** on me
What now, I pop this shit I watch that girl undress for me
Uh standing her perfume in the air
Got it feeling different in here, yeah
Yeah, she took my breath away
On to some fancy shit into another place
Such an expensive trip
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money

Chorus:
Oh, it's the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse

Oh, now she's speaking in a tongue that sounds new to me
Oh, momma tell me what this could do to me
Oh now, I wouldn't fall for something like this usually
No, no, no tell me how could I ever prepare
If my mother never was there
Oh, she took my breath away
On to some fancy ship
And to down the place... Such an expensive trip!
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money

Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse

I don't deserve a debt that came with my birth
Oh, oh, oh, what happened...

Chorus:
Oh, is the sins of my father
He left a debt to his son
To pay the the girl who's a mother
Collect the one, let me run, no
But she didn't make me pay for it with my money
I paid for the sins of my father
I'm praying I can reverse this curse
