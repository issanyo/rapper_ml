[Verse]
This goes out to you, you, my number one
(Number one, number one)
I won't stop until I see you, sugar
You know who you are
This is for my number one, number one (I see you)
So many shows, swear
Wherever I go, I'm gonna keep on looking, yeah
Looking for my number one, number one
Oh, this goes out to you, baby
Wherever you are (my only one)
Just know that you're mine (number one, number one)

[Break]
Are you there? I can't hear you
On the road, doing shows
Girl, I can't get you off my mind
All around the world
So many faces, all these places
And I just need one
My number one
This is for you
You, my number one

[Outro: crowd chanting]
Usher! Usher! Usher!
