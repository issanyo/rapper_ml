[Intro]
Yeah, let me holla at you real quick
I'ma bring y'all back to the good old, good old days
You feel me?
Some of that
Good old, good old, good old ghetto, good old
Good old, good old ghetto
Good old, good old ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Good old...

[Verse 1]
I told my man I'm having a barbecue
So grab some folks and won't you slide right through
He brought this shorty that I used to know
It brought me back to when I was in school
She said, "Usher where have you been?
We used to kick it every now and then
Remember when I used to call your phone
And tell you come on 'cause my mama's gone
How about them times I had to throw a rock at your window
To let you know
To come downstairs and open the door?
And after that, baby, it was on, fa sho"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now, honey got my head spinning around, for real
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout how good you used to feel
And I got a girl now and I don't get down like this
But I must admit I'm tempted and starting to reminisce
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto

[Verse 2]
Now, she's asking me to take her
On a tour of my house so we can catch up
For all the time lost since I blew up
And became the man that drops his pants and every girl around the world is dying to love
Break the beat down, let me tell you what I'm talking about
If you're not careful, it'll turn you out
It's that way she used to go when you want it nice and slow
Even though you can't, the memory will make you want some more
She used to understand me, touch me, hold me
Taught me how to be a man
She used to kiss me, all them things she used to show me
Damn, I wish that I could do it again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Honey got my head spinning around, for real
Cause I’m thinking ‘bout how good you used to feel
But I got a girl now and, yo, she’s right upstairs
And I must admit I’m tempted and starting to not care
'Cause...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto

[Verse 3]
Never had somebody that's so bad
Somebody with a whole lot of body
Attitude that'll make you wanna leave the one you with
'Cause you know how good it is
Not a prissy, little missy, baby, talk that slang
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thing
She was a friend of the fam, hot without the glam, not
When I be tripping, she didn't really give a damn, stop
It's what I need to do 'cause I know what this is leading to
If I keep on thinking about that back and I'm gonna be right back in it
'Cause, yo...

[Chorus]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto, ghetto
Ayo, ayo, ayo
Ain't nothing like some good old ghetto
