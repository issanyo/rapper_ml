[Intro]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
My heart could speak, baby

[Verse 1]
If I could, I'd tell you (I would tell you how)
I feel, girl, when I'm close to you
At times, I'd wish that my (heart could tell you how)
Much I love you, but my heart speaks in whispers

[Chorus]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no

[Verse 2]
If you can feel what I felt (just now, kiss me)
To prove that your love for me is true
Two hearts that beat as one
Sends signals to each other in whispers

[Chorus]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no

[Bridge]
(I would tell you how I felt)
If i could find the words to describe (the way I feel when you are near)
Whenever you are by my side
What I feel inside is deep
And I just don't know what to say (because my words get in the way)
Every time I try to say

[Chorus]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no
If my heart could speak, you'd know
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
That I love you so
I'll never let you go, no, no

[Outro]
If my heart could speak, you'd know
I'll never let you go
Girl, if my heart could speak, you'd know
I'll never let you go
If my heart could speak, you'd know
I'll never let you go
If my heart could speak, you'd know (I'll never let you go)
That I love you so (I'm gonna keep on holding on, holding on)
I'll never let you go
(Never let you go
Oh, never let you go
Never let you go, baby, baby...)
