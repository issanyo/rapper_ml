[Intro]
Baby, tonight
If you come home, I'll make it right, oh no
Love was here and gone

[Verse 1]
I ask myself
Now, why have I been dreaming
To bring imaginary, real to life
I've done some searching and praying
That you would always be stayinf
And I would learn
Learn to treat you right, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" (Yes I do)
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?" (Ask yourself)
"Do I know how to take good care of you?"
The answer that I truly love you
Will pop right in your mind

[Chorus]
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home
Come on home, come on home

[Verse 2]
If I've given you a reason, let me know
To make your leave, it must have been that I don't show
You love the way you need, so girl, I can't complain
Let's try to work it out, my heart's truly ashamed

[Pre-Chorus]
So if you ask yourself
"Does he really love me?" (Yes I do)
"Will I be true
Throughout the time?" (Ask yourself)
"Do I know how to take good care of you?"
The answer that I truly love you
Will pop right in your mind

[Chorus]
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home

[Bridge]
Girl, just come on home
This time I'll do you right
Let's ignore the fuss and fight
Just come back home
Trying to bring us back girl, so don't you ever leave
I used to love you (but you're gone)
I wanna hold you (so come back home)
I wanna be with you (you and I alone)
So baby, please
I used to love you (but you're gone)
I wanna hold you (please come back home)
I wanna be with you (I wanna be with you, too)
So baby, please (baby, come back, come back home)

[Chorus]
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, please come home
Love was here, but now you're gone
Baby, please, just come back home

[Outro]
Love was here
That's just all I know, baby
Love was here, but now you're gone
