[Intro: Usher]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
It’s home, we’re all right here, A time
I like this
You know I like this
CiCi
Usher baby

[Verse 1: Ciara]
I want it hot, I want it loud. Make it loud, make it loud
Make it boom boom; m-m-make it boom boom
The speakers loud, making rumble
Turn this club into a jung – turn-turn this club into a jung
T-turn this club into a jungle, jungle
And everybody knows it’s on tonight
Beat’s like it’s strong; it feels so right
Feel like I’m alone here in a crowd, just me and my song

[Bridge]
Make it loud
I love it loud, can you turn it up? Hey, hey
Those speakers out, will we turn it up?
Hey, hey, turn it so loud, you can raise the dead
Hey, hey
Brings them out of the grave

[Hook: Ciara]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up, up
Turn it up, up, up
Turn it up, up, up

[Verse 2: Usher]
Usher baby
Put it up, turn it up
Let go, I know you want to
I want to see you move it, move it
Take it up, shake it up
I can't help myself, I want you
That-that booty on me, on me, me
Oh, everybody know what’s on tonight
The beats like it’s strong; it feels so right
Feel like I’m alone here in this crowd
Just me and my song

[Bridge]

[Hook: Usher & Ciara]

[Breakdown:]

[Ciara]
I turn it up to the beat song
I make it hot like a beat, y’all
You see that booty she movin’?
I like the way when you mouth try

[Usher]
Oooh don’t stop, stop, keep it up
I think I’m falling in love
I’m getting ready to
Slow down

[Bridge]

[Hook]
