[Verse1]
Your body's like Hocus Pocus babe
It's magical to me (Whoa)
Do me a favor come here and pinch me baby
I wanna make sure this ain't a dream (Dream)
I said it's just like fire, shot up in my bones
Cause you take me higher, now baby 3, 2, 1, let's go

[Pre-Hook]
I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

[Hook]
What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face up on a milk carton

Where you been all my life's without ya
Cause I been living beneath my means
Given my situation (Oh)

You know what I'm talking about babe
I said it's just like fire shot up in my bones
Cause you take me higher, girl 3, 2, 1, let's go

[Pre-Hook]
I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true that people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

[Hook]
What's missing is you babe (You babe)
