[Verse 1: Usher]
A foreign beauty so exotic
When she smiled at me, she took my breath away
She's reminiscent of a goddess
It's a shame that we could not communicate
How do I say...

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
My baby, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say?

[Verse 2: Usher]
The room was filled with a sweet aroma
When she danced, her hips moved oh so sensuous
She speaks with her body, so hypnotic
In the language that I never will forget

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
I hear her calling
Spinning around in the crowd till she found me
Then she started moving closer and closer
Does she know that I want her, I want her?
I wanna be with her tonight
So I caressed her face, kissed her lips
All my life, I've never felt quite like this
I've never had a loss for words
One kiss from her has got me speechless

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I really wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mon chéri, how do I say, how do I say?

[Bridge: Usher]
Baby, let's engage in a deep conversation
In the body language we speak, won't need any translation
An odyssey of physical pleasure
As we explore
Together, this universal language of our love
(my love, my love, my love) x2
Can you tell me, how do I put it into words?

[Chorus: Usher]
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Molto bella, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mon chéri, how do I say, how do I say?
How do I say hello? I just wanna talk to you
How do I say you're beautiful when I can't take my eyes off you?
I don't wanna say the wrong thing, I wanna use the right words to impress you
Mujer bonita, how do I say, how do I say?

[Outro: Usher & Female]
