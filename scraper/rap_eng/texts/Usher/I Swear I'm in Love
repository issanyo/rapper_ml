Hey, uhum, it's love
You and me got love
Like she do to me

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

[Verse 1:]
It seems to be the problem loving you
'Cause I love everything about you
The way you do the things that you do
I'm so happy baby, to have you here with me
And there ain't no doubt about it
I'm gonna keep you here with me
No matter what I do, I'm gonna keep loving you
Every day, every night
(It's so good to say)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

[Verse 2:]
I'm in love with the things you know you do to me
And there ain't no shame about the way we swang, baby
I'll go crazy if there's no you in me
'Cause I just can, I always need you here with me
No matter what I do, I'm gonna keep loving you
Every day, every night
(It's so good to say)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love

I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
I need you every day, I need you every night
(I'm in love with you)

[Chorus:]
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
Baby, baby, I'm in love, I swear I'm in love
