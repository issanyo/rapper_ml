[Verse 1: D'Shaun]

I said hey lil mama
How you doing today
I'm tryna put you on game
To the game that I play

I got my city all behind me
Like the Macy's Parade
I see you trapped inside your issues
Let me take you away (uh)

A young scholar
Been about a dollar
Pimp game proper
Bet a nigga pop his collar (oh)

The Don Dada
African Bambaataa
I roll with my shottas
If ya man gotta problem (uh)

You bad as daycare kids
But I'll take care of it
And when I get my slice of that pie
I ain't sharing it

I see them other girls, yeah yeah
They all desperate
RYLTY the team
And you talking to the head of it

I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?

Looking like Elle Varner
Deserve a refill
I put that on the Bible
You could meet my momma

You sharper than piranha
Dressed in that designer
And she ain't with the drama
I swear I'm tryna find her

She bad then a mother
A nigga gotta love her
And they all tryna touch ya
But they get nothing from ya


[Hook]

I need a bad girl
If you're a bad girl
I need a bad girl
If you're a bad girl

I need a bad girl
If you're a bad girl
I need a bad girl
If you're a bad girl

I need a bad girl
Make some noise if you a bad girl
Put ya hands in the air if you a bad girl


[Vamp]

I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?

I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a supermodel?
I mean what you niggas know about a bridge?


[Bridge: Usher: Bad Girl]


If you want to party
I got what'chu lookin' for
Come see me in the V.I.P
It's very necessary
To be that kinda girl for me
If you are, then baby come
Let's leave


[Outro]

So I had to settle down because
Pimpin' ain't easy
So I got me, one bad girl because
Pimpin' ain't easy
