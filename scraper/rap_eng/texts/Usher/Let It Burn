I don't understand, why!
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end and its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we didn't been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby?, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn
When the feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn you gon' learn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know
It's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself
Callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
And all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Oh, man I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours
I'mma be burnin' till you return
When the feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn you gon' learn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know
It's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, oh
I'm twisted cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, can ya feel me burnin'?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' till you return
When the feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
Cause, the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn you gon' learn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know
It's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
