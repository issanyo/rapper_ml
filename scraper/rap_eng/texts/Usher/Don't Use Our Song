[Ann Wilson]
It's that time of year
Campaign season's here

[Michael Bolton]
You'll wave and point and make your speeches
While balloons fall everywhere

[Usher]
But we notice something's wrong
And it's gone on way too long
So we're asking you right now
Stop using our songs

[Dan Reynolds]
[?] turn on your laser light show
Fire up your confetti machine

[Usher]
Bring out your smile and backdrop
Of ethnically diverse teens

[Cyndi Lauper]
Stop using our music
That's our one and only rule

[Sheryl Crow]
We didn't write these songs
To make your campaign stop seem cool

[Chorus]
Don’t use our songs
Cause you'll use it wrong
It might seem appealing
But you're just stealing
Don’t use our songs
It just seems wrong
By the time this song is through
You'll be lucky if we don't sue
Don't use our song, no

[Usher]
That's licensing. You gotta call my publisher, OK?

[Ann Wilson]
You always take our music
Out of context anyway

[Dan Reynolds]
Why would Reagan be playing
Born in the USA

[Ann & Nancy Wilson]
It's about Vietnam!

[Michael Bolton]
Thank you for not paying me
That’s a license you didn’t buy

[Josh Groban]
If I wanted to sing and not get paid
I’d be on Spotify

Don't use our songs
I mean, come on
You knew we'd find out
This is like the sixth time now

Don't use our song
It's not your song
You're lucky we don't sue
And what's he deal with all those balloons?

Don't use our songs

[Dan Reynolds]
And just to be clearer
You can’t use this song either

[John Mellencamp]
But here's one tune we all agree
That you can use any time for free

[Cat playing organ interlude]

Don't use our songs
Won't sing along
It might seem appealing
But you're just stealing

Don’t use our songs
For real, come on
You're lucky we don't sue
And what's he deal with all those balloons?

The crowd might like it
But you didn't write it
