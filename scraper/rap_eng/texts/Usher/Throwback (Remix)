[Intro: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here wit me
You're gonna need me
And now that day's here, and your man got to shed tears
Mmm, you're gonna want me back

[Verse 1: Usher]
You never miss a good thing till it leaves you
Finally, I realized that I need you
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby

[Chorus: Usher]
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
I'm going out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

[Bridge 1: Usher & Sample]
Aww, baby, what you say now?
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
And still I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
Need you, babe

[Verse 2: Usher]
If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doing, babe
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish that I could try
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work

[Chorus: Usher]
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
I'm going out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

[Bridge 2: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Wish I can throw it back
I want it the way it use to be
You're gonna need me
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Give me one chance to make it work

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm trying to stay strong, I don't wanna crack
But I need her and she told me I'm gon' want her back
Should've believed her, now I'm wishing I could throw me back
To that exact spot where we found L-O-V-E at
Lose some, then I lose again, when am I gonna win some?
I said a lot of things out of anger, but I meant some
I brought a lot of things to the table besides income
I just want things to go back to how they used to be
I was used to you and I thought you were used to me
Time is against me
You never miss something till it's gone
That's my word, ma, you convinced me
It might not happen, but I'm still hoping
And my heart is broken, but the door is still open
Pillow still soaking, your boy still locing
Dutch still lit and a bottle still open
And if I don't get another chance, it'll be hard to get focused

[Chorus: Usher & Sample]
Give me one chance to make it work
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby
I'm going out of my mind, I'm running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby
It's driving me crazy
Because I'm missing my baby (mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl (you're gonna need me)
Said, I'm about to go crazy
'Cause I've been needing you lately (mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm going out of my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

[Outro: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here wit me
You're gonna need me, need me one day
And now that day's here and your man got to shed tears
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
I'm sitting by the phone, realizing she ain't ever coming home
Gonna need me, need me one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back...
