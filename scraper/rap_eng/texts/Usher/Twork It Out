[Intro]
Yo, check this here
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend this time with you, alright?
So why don't we just chill
And make it cold cold, sexy, you know?
You sure looking right
Spend some quality time, and
You make me wanna cha, cha, cha, ah, cha, cha
Yeah, right there, just keep it right there
And I know you're gonna like it
Ooh baby, you sure love to...
Know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
We've been hanging out every day this week
How 'bout a nigga fix you something to eat
And just chill, we ain't gotta wild out, just chill
Parlay, little momma, right here
Sipping on chardonnay, slip on that Vicki Secret lingerie
'Cause I ain't trying to throw my money away (in the streets)
If I can see you twork it out for me

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out

[Verse 2]
Now that I got you all soaking wet
I bet you know what's coming next
I'm gonna twork you out
Oh baby, let me tell you how
What do you think about me
Tworkin' you from your front to your back end?
Kick back and relax
Come sit up on my lap, shorty
Tonight, I'm taking you all the way
Won't stop until you scream my name

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out

[Bridge 1]
Morning is coming and I don't want to let you go
Let's just lay here in this bed of red rose petals
I know that we're spent, but one kiss can make this start all over again
If you want it, baby, come with me

[Bridge 2]
It's way too trill
The way you making me feel
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby, you sure love to ball
It's way too trill
The way you making me feel
The way you're tworkin' is oh so sexy
Ooh baby, you sure love to ball

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out
Let me twork it
I won't hurt it
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
Girl, I'll work it
I won't hurt it
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out
It'll be just me on you
From 11 to 6 in the morning
I know you like it when I do you like that
Let's twork it out
