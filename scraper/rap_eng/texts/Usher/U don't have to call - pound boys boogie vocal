Yo after tonight
Don't leave your girl around me
True playa fo' real
Ask my nigga Pharrell

Situations will arise
In our lives
But U gotta to be smart about it
Cele-brations with the guys

I sacrified
'Cause I knew U could not sleep without it
Meanwhile I, I
I loved U

U were my girl
U see I, I
Thought the world of U
But you're still steady leavin'

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

Aw girl your face is
Sayin' why
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me

Listenin' to friends, now it's the end
And again
No story can end without it
Damn right
I loved U

You were my girl
U see I, I
Thought the world of U
But you're still steady leavin'

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home

Waitin' for love
So tonight
I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's part

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
Imma be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause imma be alright tonight

Gonna boogie tonight
'Cause I'm honestly too young of a guy
To stay home
Waitin' for love
So tonight I'm gonna do what a single man does
And that's party

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'm a be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'm a be alright tonight

U don't have to call
It's okay girl
'Cause I'm a be alright tonight
