[Chorus: Usher & Ester Dean]
I'm like, whoa, Kemosabe
Your body is my hobby
We freaking, this ain’t cheating as long as we tell nobody
Tell your girls you leaving, I’ll meet you in the lobby
I’m so cold, yeah, I need that hot tottie
Hot tottie, hot tottie
I thought I'd never fall in love, thought I'd never fall in love with you

[Verse 1: Usher]
I see you like to talk, I hear you baby
Claiming you a bad bitch, show me, baby
I’m a wild boy, you trying to tame me, baby?
Till I get away from the house, can you keep me faithful?
Got a lot of girls, got a lot of flavor
That's why when I hit them, they all need to return the favor
Yeah, I hear you, what you saying, but hear it, babe
That you get with me to the point where I'm screaming your name

[Bridge 1: Usher]
Said, I'm trying get your clothes off
From what I'm seeing, you look so soft
It's your body, what I'm going off
Say, you go ride it, just don't fall off
Yeah, I done had a lot of women that tell me what they can do
But can you show me, babe?
Yeah, you got me like...

[Chorus: Usher & Ester Dean]

[Bridge 2: Usher]

[Verse 3: Jay Z with Usher]
They call me King Hov, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy, copy, copy?
They call me King Hov, copy? Big balling is my hobby
So much so they think I’m down with the Illuminati
My watch do illuminate, my pockets are naughty
But I’m God body, you better ask somebody
I was born a God, I made myself a king
Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess, I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her poppy like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we birthed a couple of sacks
And as the tea steeped, I creeped all in her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking
In tongues, she like young, you hung, what you done done
Stop it, before you wake up my mom, I might (ah)
And now that you arrived, it’s time that I go
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

[Chorus: Usher & Ester Dean]
I'm like, whoa, Kemosabe
Your body is my hobby
We freaking, this ain’t cheating as long as we tell nobody
Tell your girls you leaving, I’ll meet you in the lobby
I’m so cold, yeah, I need that hot tottie
Hot tottie, hot tottie
I thought I'd never fall in love, thought I'd never fall in love with you

[Outro: Usher]
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I need a hot tottie
Will you be my hot tottie?
She said she wanna make me better
She wanna make me better
