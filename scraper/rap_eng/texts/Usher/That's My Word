(Intro)
On Everything
You know I hurt you when I lied to you
So bogus Baby
Naw you didn't deserve that
On everything
I never meant to hurt you
You was the best thing that ever happened to me
I'm sorry
On everything

(Verse 1)
I know you got tired
(tired)
Of me showing up at your house 2 hours late
Aye
Making up excuses
(excuses)
You could tell that I was lying right to your face
Oh ooh oh

(Hook)
I don't know what was wrong with me
I don't know
Was tripping like I didn't know that...
Didn't know that
You were the best thing...
Oh ooh oh oh oh
That ever happened to me
That ever happened to me yeah
If you could find it in your heart to give me just one more chance
Yes one more chance yeah yeah yeah

(Chorus)
I'm gonna be what you want me to be...
Oh Baby
If you let me back into your world
Only if you let me back in...I promise
I promise I'm through with the games
That's my word girl
That's My Word

(Verse 2)
I know I was selfish
(selfish)
I thought everything revolved around me
Ooh oh yeah yeah
And now I'm helpless
(helpless)
Cause I don't know what's it's gonna take to make you believe me again
Ooh oh oh

(Hook)

Was tripping like I didn't know that...
Like I didn't know
You always had my back
Yes you did baby
Can you forgive me
Now Whoa Oh ooh oh oh oh
If you could find it in your heart to give me just one more chance
Oh I'm gonna be...

(Chorus)

What you want me to be if you...
If you let me back into your world
Back into your world

(Bridge)
Listen

This time around...
I'll take good care of your heart
And I'll listen to you instead of...
Waiting to talk so much

And I hope you see how much I've changed
All I need is just one more chance

(Chorus)
