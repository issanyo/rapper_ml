[Intro: Enrique Iglesias & Usher]
Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go!
Dirty, dirty dancer

[Verse 1: Enrique Iglesias]
Another day, another night
And she acting like she don’t sleep
She’s a five when she drinks
But she’s a ten when she’s on top of me
Listen!

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you get it up

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias, Usher & Both]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only

[Verse 2: Usher]
It’s a game (ha) that she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It’s insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias]
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s a greedy girl to never get enough
She don’t wanna love, she just wanna touch
She’s got all the moves to make you give it up
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias, Usher & Both]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only (oh, no)
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only

[Verse 3: Usher & Enrique Iglesias]
She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely
No, she’s never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you’re lonely
C'mon

[Post-Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Usher]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only

[Chorus: Enrique Iglesias & Usher]
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She’s a dirty, dirty dancer, dirty, dirty dancer
You’ll never be her only, never be her only

[Outro: Enrique Iglesias]
The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer
The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer
The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop
Dirty dancer
The girl don't stop
The girl don't stop, stop
