[Intro]
We got all night, baby
Yeah, I'ma take my time with you
Now, listen
You know how daddy like it
I'm here to see you, momma
Just let me do me, all right?

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's the pressure of knowing that I'm watching you perform
Or maybe you're not used to someone that knows exactly what you want
I know the fire's burning, but baby, there's no need to be alarmed
And you can be the rain that's falling, girl, and I'll be the thunderstorm
You got no need to be nervous
Because you are safe in my hands
I'm sure you'll be needing my service
Baby your wish will be my command

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

[Verse 2]
When you're cold, I wanna be the one that keeps you warm
I'll make your body come to me, pull you back when you try to run, baby
Baby, I'll go deeper, open up if you're ready for me to feed you
Yeah, tell me who you are (let me taste it, can I take it?)
It's going down right here

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'ma touch you with my mind, kiss you with my body
If you give me time, I know you won't be sorry
This ain't Bump N' Grind, I'll show you what love is
If you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere, nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here

[Bridge]
All that I want
Is to squeeze you, touch you, kiss you, baby
And I'll provide you with that
Special kind of loving
You ain't gon' want nothing but me
You ain't going nowhere
I'll show you what love is if you let me lay you down

[Chorus]
I promise you ain't going nowhere, nowhere
You ain't going
No, you won't be sorry
You ain't going nowhere
Girl, not until you let me lay you down in here
