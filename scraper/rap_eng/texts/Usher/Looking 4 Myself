[Verse 1: Usher]
Walking with my head down
Counting every step
Hoping that the next one
Brings me closer to the man I was
'Cause I was way better
Maybe it's because
We were together

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

[Verse 2: Usher]
Escaping on the tightrope
Trying not to fall
If I don't keep my balance
I know I will lose it all
I should have known better
And it's all my fault
That we're not together

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you

[Bridge: Usher]
I was on a journey
Trying to figure out who I really was
Then I realized that
When you're not here
Half of me is gone
So in order for me to find me
I had to find you
You know? (you...)
And I got a funny feeling that (you...)
You won't know who you are
And unless you find me (you...)
It's like...
You look in the mirror (you...)
And you see the person that you truly love

[Chorus: Usher]
I said I'm looking for myself
And I still can't find me
That's why I'm looking for myself
Who am I?
Someone, remind me
I'm looking for myself
All my life, I'm searching
I said I'm looking for myself
And somehow, I ran right into
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you
You (looking for myself)
You (I, I-I, I-I-I)
You (looking for myself)
And somehow, I ran right into you
