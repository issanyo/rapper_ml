[Verse 1]
Craving your body all through the night
Feels like I'm going through withdrawals
I wanna hold you
I want you inside of these arms
I'm dying to taste you, I can't deny
Can't get out of my mind
Please let me hold you
'Cause I need your loving tonight

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Verse 2]
Constantly thinking of things to do
Places where we can make love
I wanna freak you
I'll freak you wherever you want
Placing my kisses all over you
Caressing you so nice and slow
Oh, how I want you
Girl, there's something I want you to know

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Bridge]
(Do you get lonely?)
I get lonely
(Thinking about me)
Thinking about you
(Am I the only)
Girl I dream of or think of at all?
(Are you into me, out of your mind for me?
Say you can't go a day without me)
Girl, I love you and I want you
And I need you, I need you, I need you

[Chorus]
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime
Whenever I'm near you
My love just comes down
Whenever I see you
I just want you around
'Cause I wanna feel you
All through the day and the night
Whenever I'm near you
It feels like bedtime

[Outro]
It feels like bedtime
