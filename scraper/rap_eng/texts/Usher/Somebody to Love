[Music Video]

[Verse 1]
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, "It's time to sink or swim,"
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody

[Verse 2]
Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me
I would take every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Bridge]
And you can have it all
Anything you want, I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want, I can't find
Cause money can't find me somebody to love
Oh oh, find me somebody to love, oh

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, somebody to love
I need somebody, I need somebody
I need somebody, I need somebody, I just need somebody to love

[Outro]
I need somebody, I need somebody, I need somebody to love
Is she out there? Is she out there?
Is she out there? Is she out there?
I just need somebody to love
