[Intro]
(Zaytoven!)
Big time, yeah
(A, A, A, A)
A Town, forever down
(A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, ooh)

[Chorus]
I just wanna see you in Ibiza
We can meet up, let it heat up
Blow the trees up, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
You can bring your girls, you can leave 'em
You forget your man, that's amnesia
You can slide on 'em, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)

[Verse 1]
Booty got me inspired
Move that thing to the side, yeah
We ain't ever gettin' tired, no
I know you love it when you tied up
Where we goin'? Got a flight (Flight)
You ever seen a G-5? (Yeah)
'Cause I'm a G type of guy, yeah
That's a whole different vibe, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't do this on occasion (Yeah), this my every day shit
Put your ass through college, give me brain, education
Know you ain't gon' say shit, have your man devastated
Boo, don't keep me waitin', boo, don't keep me waitin' (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I just wanna see you in Ibiza
We can meet up, let it heat up
Blow the trees up, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
You can bring your girls, you can leave 'em
You forget your man, that's amnesia
You can slide on 'em, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)

[Verse 2]
Ayy, yeah, Zay jumpin' out the Phantom (Zay)
This the Atlanta anthem (A)
Tell your girls get to dancin' (Ayy)
Helipad on the mansion
This some shit you can't fathom (No)
Spillin' drinks in the jacuzzi
Anything you can imagine (Wow)
Turn this shit into a movie

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't do this on occasion (Yeah), this my every day shit
Put your ass through college, give me brain, education
Know you ain't gon' say shit, have your man devastated
Boo, don't keep me waitin' (No), boo, don't keep me waitin' (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I just wanna see you in Ibiza
We can meet up, let it heat up
Blow the trees up, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
You can bring your girls, you can leave 'em
You forget your man, that's amnesia
You can slide on 'em, kick your feet up
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Lay-lay-lay-lay-lay)
L-l-lay-lay, l-l-lay-lay-lay (Yeah-eah)

Lay, lay
