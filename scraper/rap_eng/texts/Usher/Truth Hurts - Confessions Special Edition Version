Truth hurts

Yeah umm, see it's situations like this
That causes us players to get caught up
In, umm the truth, yeah
What you doin', where you been?

I paged you and you ain't hit me back
And I been callin' and I know
You seen my number on that caller ID, just listen to the words
I got reasons to believe that you've been foolin' around

The way you feel, the past you lived
The, the things you did
It don't matter to me for what it's worth
Just don't lie to me

'Cause that ain't what I need right now
Baby everything we built on trust
You're tearin' it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Girl I'm really tryin' hard to understand
I wanna move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain't doin' nothin'
Must be my insecurity

It's got the best of me right now
What I know I can't hold inside of me
It's gonna drive me insane
'Cause I know the truth hurts

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Sing it with me now
I can't hold on

Now wait a minute, oh, listen baby
The truth is I got this here secret, I've been keeping from you baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face, pull the hot grits out

Think you need to sit down, ho ho
I've been blamin' you when I'm the one that's doin' wrong
I'ma go on a guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song
Girl I know the truth hurts, baby

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts

That you've been foolin' around

I hope it's worth it
