You keep talking ‘bout me, still I bring a fire
You keep trippin' over me like I'm a wire
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad? (Why you mad?)
You keep bringing me down, but I turn up higher
Don't hate on the happy
It's never gonna work
Loving yourself should always come first
Never gonna change
Just my look
All my girls come sing this hook

Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
If you're jealous, you're gonna know quick
I do what I do, and I don't need this
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Don't be mad, don't-don't be mad
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why they maaad? (Why you mad?)
Cool cloud, you've been burning up just like a lighter
I can't hear your noise, I'm singing like a choir
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?

You keep bringing me down but I turn up higher
Don't hate on the happy
(On the happy) It's never gonna work
Loving yourself should always come first
Never gonna change
Just my look

All my girls come and sing this hook
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
If you're jealous, you're gonna know quick
I do what I do, and I don't need this
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Don't be mad, don't-don't be mad
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why they maaad? (Don't-don't be mad)
Hey-ey
You're just another hater (what?)
Mad ‘cause I'm goin' up the elevator (okay)
See us doin' big things and frown up
But act like it's all love when you're around us
Instead of bein' mad, you should be glad
‘Cause I could probably help you secure it back
But instead you were mad from the beginning (okay)
So all I'mma do is love and keep winning (why you mad?)

Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
(Why you mad?) If you're jealous, you're gonna know quick
I do what I do, and I don't need this
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Don't be mad, don't-don't be mad
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why they maaad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
(Why you mad?) If you're jealous, you're gonna know quick
I do what I do, and I don't need this
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Don't be mad, don't-don't be mad
Why you mad? Why you mad? Why you mad?
Why they maaad? (Don't-don't be mad)
