[Intro]
If you got something good, don't take it for granted
Hear me

[Verse 1]
It's time I learn a lesson from my drama
With the wall of this so that you don't have to feel the pain
I just gotta tell you
That one man's loss is another man's gain, yeah

Now you're the type to take your girlfriend, for granted
You should treat her like the finest thing on this here planet
And I know you're gonna wanna hit him
The minute that you see her with him

[Refrain]
'Cause you got caught slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone missin', missin', missin'
Now you're all alone wishin', wishin', wishin'
That there was something you could do, she's with him because you got caught slippin'

[Verse 2]
Woah, how soon my brothers we forget, yeah
All the things we did just to get her
All the game that we spit, all the flowers
Phone conversations for hours
Now we don't talk that long
And the lovemaking ain't that strong
Feeling like, she doing something wrong
('Cause you and I know)
She's moving on [?] gotta be strong
All because you were slippin

[Refrain]
'Cause you got caught slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone missin', missin', missin'
Now you're all alone wishin', wishin', wishin'
That there was something you could do, she's with him because you got caught slippin'

[Break]

Miss you, babe
I want my baby back
All because you were out slippin'

[Refrain]
Slippin', slippin', slippin'
Now your girl's gone dippin', dippin', dippin'
Now you can't trip (cause you did it too), trippin', trippin', trippin'
No you regret it, you can dish it
But you can't take it
