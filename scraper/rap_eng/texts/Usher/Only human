To the heart, tick tock you don't stop, stop X 8

Come on, baby, dry your eyes
Wipe your tears
Never meant to see you cry
Craig David's on the rise (uh-uh)
Check it out

I wouldn't ever try to hurt you
I just needed someone to hold me
To fill this void while you were gone
To fill this space of emptiness (oh lady)

Chorus
I'm Only Human
Of flesh and blood I'm made
I'm Only Human (what what?)
Born to make mistakes (tell me whatcha gonna do?)

If you wanna say goodbye
That's your deal (whatcha gonna do)
I'll just have to settle my time
Till you're near (lady)

I wouldn't ever try to hurt you (nah-nah, nah-nah)
I just needed someone to hold me (to hold me, yeah, yeah)
To fill this void while you were gone (whatcha gonna do?)
To fill this space of emptiness (oh lady)
Check it out and we don't stop

I'm Only Human (to the, to the)
Of flesh and blood I'm made (to the heart, tick tock you don't stop, stop)
I'm Only Human
Born to make mistakes

To the heart, tick tock you don't stop, stop X 9
Craig David's on the rise (uh-uh, check it out)

Check it out
I'm Only Human
What am I suppose to feel
I'm Only Human (lady, lady)
I'm Only Human what am I suppose to do
Born to make mistakes (I'm born to make mistakes)

I'm Only Human (i'm Only Human)
I'm Only Human
What am I suppose to do now baby (what am I suppose to do?)
I'm Only Human (I'm Only Human)
What am I supposed to do (lady)
Human lady, human, human baby
I'm Only Human hey lady, hey lady
What am I supposed to do?
I'm Only Human (I'm Only Human)
Born to make mistakes
