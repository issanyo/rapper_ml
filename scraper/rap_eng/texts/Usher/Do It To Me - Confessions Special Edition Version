Ooh no no, no no no no

I got two-dozen roses, and a card that says
"Baby, I can't wait to see you later"
We made dinner reservations, at Nobu, Mr. Chow's
You just pick the location

Now were sitting at the table
Sippin the finest wine, having damn good time
I know whats on your mind
I want you, you want me to stop frontin
I know exactly what you, what you wanna

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember

Watchin you work the stick in the ride
The motion how you move from 3rd to 5
And imagine what its gon be when we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
Ooh I can't wait

Im tired of thinkin about it, speakin about it
Baby its time to be about it, turn off the lights
Tear off your clothes, jump in the bed and let it flow
Squeezin', holdin, bitin, scratchin, spankin, screamin
Pullin my hair when you need me everything goes, baby when you

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember

So long I waited for this night to get inside you
Look in your eyes and tell you baby, take me Im yours
And if you feel anything like I feel by the end of the night
Im certain youll be screamin for more

I wanna do anything and everything to your body
Till you break down can't take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs
You gonna get it baby, please, please, oh do it to me

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember
