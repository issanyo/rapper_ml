Jimmy's just a bum
Who wants to hold on to the past
He tries to be a tough guy
But dumb kids come in last
He says he'll win her heart
His love life is a mess
He calls his Dream Girl destiny
And she calls him obsessed

He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me

Jimmy calls his Dream Girl
On the phone real late at night
He says that they were meant to be
And she lets him know she's mine
He offers her his haircut
His nice shoes
A b-ball game
All i've got is my guitar
This band and half a brain

He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me

He says he'll take my girl away
But i don't really care
And i don't worry
I know that he wants her
But it's plain to see
That jimmy's dreamgirl
She's in love with me
