What we gon' do now?
Oh lord, try some if you like it
Is slow it down on the flo'?
You know you like that
Try some if you like that
We keep this, who keep that?
Come on

When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows
But there's more to my life
Than people could ever know

Sometimes I gotta smile, when I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride, when I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you girl
I can always be myself with you girl, that's why I'm singing

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now

Since you been in my life
When I'm away from you I hurry home, oh yea
You live in my mind
So I never feel like I'm alone, yeah

Sometimes I gotta go, where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast, and I feel like slowing down
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now

You've been there for me and I'll
I'll be there for you girl

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
