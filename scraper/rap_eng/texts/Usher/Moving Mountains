[Intro]
It's like whatever I do (ooh)
Just can't get through to you (ooh, ooh)
I'm never gonna tell nothing wrong (ooh, ooh)
Listen (ooh)

[Verse 1]
Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately, I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before a great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Ooh, ooh
Be, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaaa, whoa

[Verse 2]
She, she don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl, you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
"I love you", and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, ooh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to get through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains... (moving mountains)
Baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

[Bridge]
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See, no matter what it takes
I've gotta get it together
And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Oh, I'm down, whoa

[Chorus]
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated
I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain
Steady trying to move this mountain
So, baby, why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be?

[Outro]
Baby, baby
Whoa, yeah
