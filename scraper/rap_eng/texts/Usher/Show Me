[Intro]
How's life?
Great, everybody's going through something
They gotta get over it
You can't go around
Let's just enjoy the time

[Verse 1]
The night is young
You know we've just begun
Let's have some fun
Until the moon turns to the sun
Look out, the DJ's got this party jumping
It's easy to let loose when you sipping something
Relax, it's what you deserve
There's no need to be reserved

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for

[Verse 2]
Telling you can't control what you can't have
You're here to enjoy yourself
Put time in the back of your mind
Spin what's left of it on the floor
Have another round and just enjoy this party
Put your fear aside, go head and grab somebody
Ain't no limit, no such thing as too much
And if you cause a line in the V.I
I'm waiting on you to show me

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for

[Verse 3]
If you find yourself not knowing what to do, just lift you hands up high and improvise
And don't you worry about what they think of you, all you can do is just live your life
Now is the time
Now is the time
So come and show me what you're all about, right here, right now
Yeah, it's the perfect time and place

[Chorus]
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you're made of
You'll be going, going all night, can you stay up?
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
Show me what you came here for
