[Intro]
This is for you, you, my number one
This is for you, you, my number one
(Ahhhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh yeah)
This is for you, you, my number one

[Verse 1]
Spotlights, big stage
Fifty thousand fans screaming in a rage
Bodyguards and limousines
This is the way I see you in my dreams
Paparazzi flash, hundred pictures, all of you
Hanging on my bedroom wall
I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen
But I knew since we fell in love, girl, I'd be

[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar (superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph
Sign it right here on my heart (I'll be)
Girl, I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar (superstar, yeah)
And as your number one fan
(This is for you, you, my number one)
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are

[Verse 2]
Front row, there I am
Jumping and hollering, waving both hands
Would you notice me, little me?
Drove twelve hours, girl, just to see
Your pretty face one more time
(Bought my ticket, I was first in line)
This is a metaphor to show how I adore, you (I adore you)
Baby I do

[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar (superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph
Sign it right here on my heart
Girl, I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar (superstar, yeah)
And as your number one fan
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are

[Bridge]
(Girl you know how I feel)
You're truly special, your love is legendary to me
(Without you, my life stands still)
I'll never leave your world, treat you like a diva, girl
You're one of
(Girl, you're one of a kind)
'Cause they don't make 'em like you anymore, sooo
(Sooooo, I'll be your fan for life)
I dedicate this to my superstar for all time

[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar (superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph
Sign it right here on my heart
Girl, I'll be your groupie baby
'Cause you are my superstar
And as your number one fan
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are
