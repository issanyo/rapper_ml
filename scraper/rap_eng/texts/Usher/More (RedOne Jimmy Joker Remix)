[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 1]
Watch me as I dance in up the spotlight
Listen to the people screaming out: More, more!
'Cause I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back, uh
Yeah, I create the feeling that keep 'em coming back
So captivating when I get it on the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure, with seconds left I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Verse 2]
Get out both your hands, I'm in the zone, s'aite
But I'm in the area, if you more (and) more
Cause I can't wait to feel it
I go hard, can't stop
But if I stop then just know that I'ma bring it back
Never quittin', don't believe in that

[Pre-Chorus]
Know y'all been patiently waiting, I know you need me, I can feel it
I'm a beast, I'm an animal, I'm that monster in the mirror
The headliner, finisher, I'm the closer, winner
Best when under pressure, with seconds left I show up

[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Bridge]
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you, I, I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh (I give you, I, I give you more)
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Chorus]
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more
If you really want more (more!), scream it out louder
Get it on the floor (floor!), bring out the fire
And light it up (up!), take it up higher
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more

[Outro]
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Oh ooh, oh ooh, oh ooh
Gotta push it to the limit, give it more!
