[Intro]
Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
Till I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge]
I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you gonna let you go
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you gonna let you go
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you gonna let you go
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you gonna let you go
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you gonna let you go

[Outro]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
