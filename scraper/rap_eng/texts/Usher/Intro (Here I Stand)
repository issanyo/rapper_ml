I've walked alone and felt as if no one cared
All the days so dark and dim
But it's like the rays of the sun somehow came down
To shine when you are around
And I always thought that I'd never find that one
To make me feel forever young
But if I had one wish, my life to share
Would be with you and no one else
If I had open arms, would you have a heart to spare?
If ever you want me near, I'll be there to run and say and I'm here
Giving you someone that understands and a love that will never end
I can be all that you need and more
