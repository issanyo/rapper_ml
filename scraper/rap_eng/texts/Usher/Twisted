[Intro: Usher & Pharrell]
Let me put my shades on
Everybody come around

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Verse 1: Usher]
All the time and money I've spent
Can't believe what I'm in, it ain't right
If I come back, do you promise it's gon' be you and me and the sea?
"Whatever"
No?

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Verse 2: Usher]
How come I every time my crew around
Just so happen you around, you got to show out?
It ain't right
And all that flinging your hair, glossing your lips
Shaking your hips every time you go out

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
You had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffering from delusion, I should put myself away

[Interlude: Pharrell]
Hey, all the girls, all the girls
Make sure your skirt ain't too tight
What we doing is gon' have a lot of fun
With me and you, tonight, come on

[Bridge: Usher]
You gotta twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, go twist that thing all night
Twist it to the left and twist it to the right
Twist it like you love it, yeah, twist that thing all night

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
She felt so alive, said her home life was so dead
Twenty of us on Vespas and Mopeds
Oh, there she go in there, oh, can I hold that?
What you talking ‘bout? Go ahead, forehead
Told her homegirl, now it’s getting worse and
And I was trying to hook her up with Usher
So I gave her that white Chanel lipstick
She said “How you get more out?” Twist it

[Chorus: Usher]
You got it twisted
Now tell me, why you wanna do me that way?
You got it twisted
You introducing shit, you know I don't play
So glad you had me looking stupid, but I let it go that way
That booty substituted, guess that made it okay
You had me stuck on stupid, but I let it go that way
I'm suffer from delusion, I should put myself away

[Outro: Usher]
Oh yeah, I see you
Keep twisting, baby
She can't ever get enough
