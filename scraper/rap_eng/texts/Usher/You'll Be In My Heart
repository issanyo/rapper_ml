I got you, I'll be right here
Come stop your crying
It will be all right
Just take my hand
Hold it tight now

I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong now
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm

This bond between us
Can't be broken
Said I'm gonna be here
Don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
You'll be in my heart yeah
From this day on
Now and forever more
For more no no no no(hahaha, come on, yeah)

Why can't they understand the way we feel
They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different
But deep inside us
We're not that different at all

You'll, you'll be in my heart
Yes you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forever more (forever more)
From this day on
Forever more, you'll be

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be right here in my arms, always
Always

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know
We need each other to have to hold
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

You'll be in my heart (you'll be in my heart, I'll always be there)
Yes you'll be in my heart (You know that from)
This day on
Now and forever more (now and forever more)
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be right here in my arms, always
Always

Just look over your shoulder
Listen, no matter what they say, no no
Look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll always be there

Just look over your shoulder
I'll be right there
I'll always be there
Know that I got you

Just look over your shoulder
No matter what no matter what no matter what
Just look over your shoulder
No matter what they say, no no
