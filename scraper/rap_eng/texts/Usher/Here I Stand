[Verse 1]
I'm hoping that this ain't too hard to believe
'Cause baby, you're the only one for me
I know it get hard when I'm moving in and out of state
But I promise my heart for you, I would save
Just remember that...

[Chorus]
Just remember that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand
Here I stand, baby

[Verse 2]
You're like a mirror to my soul, but a queen
And finally now I know just what that means
You're the blessing I never thought I would get
And to the Lord, I humbly bow my head

[Chorus]
Just remember that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, here I stand

[Bridge]
Ever since you came (since you came along)
It seems like (couldn't get it right)
Yeah, I felt I sunk so low
That there's was no way I could be found (never thought love would find me)
And when we make love (everytime you give, give to me your love)
Give, you make me feel a way I never felt no one else
And I can't help myself

[Chorus]
I'm telling you that no matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing, nothing, baby
Never change the way I feel, I'm your man
Listen, see, forever yours
Yours, all yours, here I stand
Here I stand, baby
No matter how far I go
And no matter how long it takes
No one or nothing can change
Forever yours, I'll remain, here I stand
