[Intro]
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Verse 1]
Living on the edge, out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I work hard to provide all the material things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I'm trying to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

[Chorus]
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone
Why?

[Verse 2]
Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you girl, can't you see

[Chorus]
Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone

[Bridge]
Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love

[Chorus]
Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave (I don't understand, girl, I'm just a man)
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl, I'll never stop 'cause you're all I got, baby (please stay, don't go, don't wanna be alone)
Can you help me?
Help me understand, I can be your man
It's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh, baby

[Outro]
Ooh, girl, I love you (said I love you, girl)
You know I need you (I need you)
I can't live without you (I can't go one day without you)
Ooh, girl, I love you (ooh, girl, I need you)
You know I need you
I can't live without you (Can I have you?)
Ooh, girl, I love you
You know I need you
I can't live without you
Ooh, girl, I love you (if you understand, can you help me now?)
You know I need you (sing along)
I can't live without you (Yeah, babe)
You know I need you
