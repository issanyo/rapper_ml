[Verse 1]
Re-introduction to a feeling I don't wanna know
Yeah, I've been running, but it caught me somehow
The rule was never fall in love, I did it anyway
You make my heartbeat keep pumping, why the hell you turn it up so loud?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
It's just you and me together
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Chorus]
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Verse 2]
I really know the way and thought I could get in and out
She said, "Relax, you gonna be here for a while"
But I threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
And the truth is, I'm learning to love it and I ain't gonna turn it down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the fire don't fear the water
And the night don't fear a thief
Once the music sets you over
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are

[Chorus]
Here we are, we are, we are
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Bridge]
Here we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria

[Chorus]
And you're glowing from inside
Like the dawn is in your eyes
And I see it for the first time
Here we are, we are, we found euphoria
