[Intro]
{The game 'bout to change, Usher}
Whoa, man, y'all are something else
Yeah, a lot of women
You know they say y'all do it better than us
(And I learned from the best, man)
Because we only see what you're doing
But I see you
Where we at?
This right here is for my triple G's with the double Ds
Go get them, girls
You know who you are
Where we at?
Over here looking how we looking, ain't that right?
Go get them, girls
I see you

[Verse 1]
I profess, I'm a lover, minor scholar of anatomy
Doctor of feminine chemistry
Got a healthy fascination for a multitude of relation
With plenty women that's still on their feet
And it happens that every once in a while
I go too deep that I gotta shut it down
She keep on coming by, won't quit calling
It's safe to say that she's falling
She pleading, she don't want me to leave
I had to tell her

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover

[Verse 2]
As a quid pro quo, we can both come and go
This ain't about fidelity
Thought I was a pimp, player, hustler, baller
Whoa, man, she a G and do it better than me
And it happens that every once in awhile
She gon' cook just to hook you for a while
Can't escape, take your pick, either way, you're a trip
'Cause man, if she laying for it, that means you paying for it

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no
She keep on begging for more
No, no, no
She said you don't love me no more
That's when I be like

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover

[Bridge]
Tick-tock, better hurry, time's running out
So you better be sure before we lay down
Knock-knock, daddy's home, open up, girl
I can tell that it's been awhile, you've been waiting
Through it so many times (with women that I do it for)
Ain't trying to make you mine (but I like the feeling)
Let's both be honest here, baby
We don't go through drama here, baby
'Cause when you give it up
You gon' get addicted and go crazy and lose your mind
How many of you like that?
Keep on asking me for more (more, more, more)

[Chorus]
Loving me, baby, that's a no-no
I'm better when I touch and go
I'm trying to add your name to my hall of fame
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover

[Outro]
(Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, lover
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover)
Better ask somebody
Players (lover)
Real G's feel me on this one
Ain't that right, girl? Yeah
(Not just a player, I'm a pro lover)
Not just a player, I'm a pro lover, pro lover (lover)
(Not just a player, I'm a pro)
I know you got it, baby (pimps.. hustlers)
Biggest player in the world
Yeah, you know who you are, haha
