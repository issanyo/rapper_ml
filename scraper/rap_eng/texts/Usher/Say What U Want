[Intro]
Zaytoven
I know and I can't take it back
I hurt you, gon' beat it up

[Chorus]
Say what you want
But don't say it's over
Call me out my name
Just don't say you over me
We made need a break
Just don't say it's over
It might take some space
But girl don't say you over me

[Verse 1]
Don't say it's over, don't say it's over
You say you ain't looking back, still looking over your shoulder
Always focus on the bad, the negative will get you nowhere
You tripping on me off a photo
You staying with me and you know it
If you want forever girl we can get it like that
Let me kiss it where it hurts, I can fix it like that
It might take a minute but we gon' get it right back
We might miss a beat

[Chorus]
Say what you want
But don't say it's over (You can)
Call me out my name
Just don't say you over me
We made need a break
Just don't say it's over
It might take some space
But girl don't say you over me

[Verse 2]
Have you prayed about letting me go?
Do you really feel like letting go?
Is this the end of our time let me know
If we make it through the pain we'll grow
Ohhhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh-ohhhh
We can argue all day, we can talk about it baby
Ohhhh-ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh-ohhhh
Say what you want, I can take it girl

[Chorus]
Say what you want
But don't say it's over (Oh)
Call me out my name
Just don't say that you over me yeah-yeah-yeaah
We made need a break
Just don't say it's over
It might take some space
But girl don't you say that you over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say it's over (Nah), don't say it's over (Yuh)
You say you ain't looking back
Don't say it's over (Nah), don't say it's over (Yuh)
You say you ain't looking back (Back)

[Chorus]
Say what you want
But don't say it's over
Call me out my name
Just don't say that you over me
We made need a break
Just don't say it's over
It might take some space
But girl don't say you over me

[Outro]
But we can't end it like that
Aye man we done covered everything
I think...I think we got it all but we can't end it like this
I like that
There you go
That's it
Alright here ya go, you got it
