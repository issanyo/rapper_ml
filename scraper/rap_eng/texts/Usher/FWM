[Intro]
What's so complicated?
Everything's so simple when you say it
Ain't no one said the shit was easy
Know I said I'd take you out in the city
But, damn, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me
Now, fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Bridge]
I'ma be real with you now, I don't know why I called her
When you called me, I was wrong, so that's why I bought ya
A couple things for your wrist that's shining in the dark
So I was hoping you'd forgive me and that's why I bought it (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
(Yeah, can't you see that I'm trying?)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Hook]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?

[Verse]
Tell me what nigga is perfect?
Tell me what nigga is right?
Tell me what nigga been with the same bitch
And she been holding it down for life
Tell me who get it right on the first try?
I know I did wrong, but what nigga is trying harder
Than the one in this song?
Can you stay down? Oh babe
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Boo don't give up on me now
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Hook]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me

[Bridge]
I ain't perfect, but smile, I'll give you amazing, worth it
A good man you deserve it
Bear with me I promise I'm working (on it)
No, I ain't changing overnight
Didn't you see me change your life?
I can admit that a lot, can we put this shit aside
You know it ain't bad all the time
Baby you see me trying
Fuck with me

[Hook]
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
Baby I can change, can you stick around? (yeah)
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
It's easy when I'm up, can you hold me down?
Fuck with me, fuck with me, fuck with me
