Close the door, I'ma take your clothes off where you are
I turn you on 'cause I love to see you glowin', yeah
I know it's good, I can tell by the way you walk, yeah
I'll pull your close 'cause I love to feel you comin' down, yeah (down)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the mattress is so far away
And my clock is watching, ain't no time to waste (woo, ah)
Since my hands already down your waist
You better show me, that you want it right away 'cause
I'll freak you right, I will
I'll freak you right, I will
I'll stick my tongue
I'll speak that language
Use my foreign skill
My hands all in your hair
Naked before we hit the stairs
Can't even make it there

[Chorus]
No we ain't gon' make it to my bed (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know we ain't gon' make it to my bed, no (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Know we ain't gon' make it to my bed (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tear it up when I get wasted (wasted), now that I got you naked
I know we ain't gon' make it to my bed

Naked before we hit the stairs
Can't even make it there (ow)

[Chorus]
No we ain't gon' make it to my bed (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
