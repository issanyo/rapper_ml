Ladies, we gon try something different this time
I ain't sayin you wrong for doin it how you do it, fellas
But its something different
(When put a lil extra in it man Im tellin you, you get a lil more power)
Sing it ladies, listen
I see you standin here lookin real nice
I bet I know whats going through your mind
You probably thinkin that every man in here
Is lookin for somebody for one night
Your friends drug you out cause you ain't wanna come
Thats why youre standin there actin stuck up
Holdin up the wall, you got a misconception of men
Thinkin were all the same, full of games
All because you ended up with the wrong one
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Your probably like, why did I pick you
Well, Im over there, you L double okay at me like, ooh
And I was wonderin whats your N A M E

And her reply was S O double R Y
Thanks for the compliment
But I gotta let you know Im probably not your type
You got a misconception of me, listen and Ill make you see
Dont let one B A D a double P L E spoil it for the bunch
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
Now this ain't for everybody man
So dont get twisted on what Im sayin
If you wit somebody right now
But you feel that they playin
Then I know that you understand
How it feel when you talk for hours
Show up at the door wit some flowers
When you put a lil extra in it
Man it give you just a lil more power
Most of us go the extra mile
To get what even though it ain't our style
The stuff Im talkin most ain't seen
Or heard since they was just a lil' child
Im tryna show you how to really get her on
Im tryna show you how to really get her home
Im tryna show you how to have shorty mind
All messed up in the zone, just tell her I
I bet you think that chivalry is gone
Cause you ain't seen nothing like it in so long
Its when you open her door, walk on one side of her
You give her your coat when its cold outside
A man ain't a man until hes man to his woman
Compliments and flowers really lets her know that you want her
Let me spell it out C H I V A L R Y
Girl, if you feel like chivalry is gone girl, Ima change your mind
