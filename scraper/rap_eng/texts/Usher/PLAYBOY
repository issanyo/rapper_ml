You see you're searchin for somebody that'll take you out and do you right
Well, come here baby and let daddy show you what it feel like
You know all you gotta do is tell me what'cha sippin on
And I promise that I'm gonna keep it comin all night long
Look him in the eyes

Pulled up like a trap-star
That's if you had yo regular car
You ever made love to a thug in the club wit' his ice on?
87 Jeans and fresh pair of Nikes on
On the couch, on the table
On the bar, or on the flooooo'
You can meet me in the bathroom
Yeah you know I'm trained to go

[Bridge: Usher]
You might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touchin like this
I know ya scared, baby they don't know what we doin
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl and I swear
