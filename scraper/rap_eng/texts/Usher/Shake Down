I wanna be all you need, baby
And I want you to be my superwoman
Boy, I will be your friend forever
Well, go on and leave me that heart and you can get mine

I'm gonna be your baby for life
If you're in the dark I'll be a sunlight
'Cause all you need is my love
I'm telling you what's up so just make room for love

It's a shake down, shake down

And through time my love will stay persistent, boy
All of me is what you're getting, let the world be the witness
Bad times, we'll work it out like fitness or we live it

Boy, I will hold you up, hold you up if you fall
I see us in your chamber
Your heart's in danger
Oh, taking your love

If love is the crime, I'm down for it
(If love is a crime)
Let love be the judge I receive the verdict
Now, take me, baby in your arms
(Take me in your arms)
Hold me tight, don't put up a fight

It's a shake down, shake down
Come on baby, get down, get down

I'm willing to do some time, baby
(Do your time)
To make sure that your love is mine, all mine

Shake down, shake down
