[Intro]
(Love ya, love ya, love ya)
Let me, let me, hah
(Let me love ya)

[Verse 1]
It only happens once in a lifetime
I'ma meet somebody that's perfect or true, baby
You got me and I got you, baby
Tell your ex it's mine and I won't lose if you choosing, baby
Baby, you know that you're more than just a friend to me
Don't let nobody convince you that we enemies
I was down for the count, I was down we was out
And I stole that, how it would've led to me
You's my little secret
They don't know you freaky, with a chick like you I'm conceited
And when my mama fuck with you and my brother fuck with you
Need the baby in the crib where we completed
You got money, I got money, no competing
F gang but we always on some G shit
I'm on some OJ with the pussy, I'ma beat it
Beep-beep-beep-beep, BJ and repeat it
All the above is the truth
Trust in me like I trust in you
Fuck with me like I fuck with you
How am I real if I ain't real with you?
Let me love ya

[Chorus]
Let me love ya, let me love ya
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you
Let me love ya (wanna love you babe)
Love you babe
Hear what I'm saying, ooh ooh
Love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)

[Verse 2]
You the realest bitch out here, we all admit that you the shit
New BMW, new tint so dark the cops gotta squint
So you driving out the city to make money that I'll never let you spend
See that's something broke niggas just will never comprehend
We hit the strip together and we tip together
Hit the lick together, oh
Hit the crib together, book the Ritz together
This is it forever, oh
Hit the jewelry, 3,000 dollar outfit
'Cause I gotta flex for my baby
We just swerved on these hoes
It's adjourned on these hoes, I wanna know

[Chorus]
(When you gon' let me? You gotta trust me baby)
Let me love ya, let me love ya
Let me be the one to, let me be the one to love you
Let me love ya (baby believe it)
(Wanna love you babe)
(You better know, girl I ain't taking no, I, I really love you)
Love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) (nobody gon' love you how I'ma love you)
Love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Who gon' treat you the best?)
(Let me love you) love you, ouu, ouu, ouuuu (let me love you)
(Let me love you down...)

[Outro]
Ready, told you I was ready
(Let me love you)
Said that I was ready for you
Ready, I'ma show you, ahhhh
(Ahhh, it never really mattered too much to me)
