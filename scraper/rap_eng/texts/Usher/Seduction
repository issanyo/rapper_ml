[Intro]
Sexy, women, women
Sensuous, sexy, voluptuous, hah
It don't matter, baby
When you got it, you got it
Seduce me baby, seduce me

[Verse 1]
Just to get my attention, send a note and a drink
When we made eye connection, she just nodded and winked
On this note it said, "It's 'bout time we get together
Let's dance now, hook up later, we can do whatever"
She had confidence, it's all part of the game
'Cause to her, who I'm with don't really mean a thing
She knew what I liked and now I'm thirsty for more, baby

[Chorus]
Seduction
Sensuous, sexy, erotic
How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

[Verse 2]
Baby, you got my attention, what you gon' do with it? (Ha ha)
Baby, turn around, stick it out, I wanna see it
She'll make the first move, smooth, intoxicating
She crazy (I like it, I'ma be honest)
I'm fighting not to lose control
I'm feeling a little tension, don't know whose watching
Getting big (in too deep, and I can't stop it)
You're making it (HARD) for me to stay
(HARD) to walk away
(HARD) don't wanna play no more
(HARD) ohh, I can't take it baby

[Chorus]
Seduction
Sensuous, sexy, erotic
How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)
Seduction
Sensuous, sexy, erotic
How you working your body
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)

[Bridge]
Baby, whatever you want, girl, you got it
Long as you're satisfied
'Cause it's so hard to resist
Ooh, your body got me on fire
Got vivid thoughts in my mind
The positions that I'm gonna try
But is it worth all the hurt?
Should I risk it just for one night?
Once I give in
She's gonna win
Either way I lose

[Verse 3]
I'm trying to chill, but she's got me on the spot
She's so cocky and the way that she watching me
Got me feeling hot, uh
Shorty know that I got a girl and I really can't break the rules
Plus paparazzi snapping shots
And it's hard for me to shake these fools
So do I one: put it on her, work my way to the front?
Do I two: play my part and sure, don't try to pull no stunts?
Or maybe three: (yeah) chase the cat 'cause she's sending me on the hunt
Nah, bump that, I ain't no punk
I'm gonna give shorty what she want
Watch this

[Chorus]
Seduction (ready to go)
Sensuous, (taking you up on what you said earlier) sexy, erotic
How you working your body (when we danced)
You gon' make me do it, do it to you
Seduction
You thought out your best to get me out of control, baby
More I play around with you
Make me wanna get down with you (down)
Down with you (down), down with you (down, down)
