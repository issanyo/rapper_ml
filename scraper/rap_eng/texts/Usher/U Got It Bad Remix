[DJ Talking ]

Ladies, this is for ya'll
You Got It Bad Remix

[ Joe Budden Talking ]

I Like how that feels
Been there, done it
Let'em know

[ Usher ]
When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways, like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

I've been there, done it, walked around
After all that this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then maybe..

[Chorus]
U got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
U got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Oh you got it bad when you're stuck in the house, you don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone but you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad

When you say that you love 'em and you really know
Everything that used to matter, it don't matter no more
Like my money or my car, you can have it all
Flowers, cards and candy, I do it just 'cause
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl, I want you to know that I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on look at your mate, and help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl, I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world

Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man, promise to love you the best I can
See I've been there, done it, walked around
After all that this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me, it's too bad that you can't see
That you got it

[ Chorus ]
[ Joe Budden ]
Been there, my own experienes ya'll

I +Had It Bad+ for a chick that was far from the average broad, shorty had me dawg
Had me callin accessivly, and when ma wasn't around the thought was depressin' me
Had me not drinkin' no more, no hoes, actin' up on the job, no call, no shows
Basically reppin' for her, me and you mami against the world not a second to her
Ma do I adore you, fa sho
Would I give my life for you, fa sho
From the go X and O's, to ice in your life, from peoples to girlfriend, wifey to wife
Made me wanna quit this mackin', and you won't know when you sippin', that shit just happens
No secrets ain't gotta hide my chedder
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
Seein' you talk in the past, look my dawgs'll respect
'Cause it's your whole demenour, mind, body and soul, it's more than the sex
And I know that it musta been fate how we touch so much
You a chick that I hate cause I love so much
Me and You can get paid throwin' dubbs so much
And you scared I cut your 'caine 'cause I thug so much
Everybody wanna know why I'm so thirst now
A look is a power you, it's her style
And you lookin' me out boo, I ain't hurt now
I thought I +Had It Bad+ before I'm worse now
Unheard of, ma you as my mate, it's murder
Listen, I know your probably scared, you don't wanna break the bond by takin' it further
Understood, mami you all that and I'm all hood
So the kid +Havin' it bad+ is all good
If you feel me holla
