Baby the other day I was thinking
And wondering what would it be like
If I had you in my life

And baby its something about you
That touches me inside
You make me feel so right

Oh baby you can act if you want
You can try to run away from me
I know I got what you want
Give it time and you'll see
Its not about what I want
Take all the time that you need
Baby I don't want to rush
Just let it be what its gonna be

Baby why don't you just stop playin'
I don't care how hard you try
You can run but you can't hide

Oh baby I know just what your feelin'
The truth you can't deny
Hopefully one day you'll realize

You can act if you want
You can try to run away from me
I know I got what you want
Give it time and you'll see
Its not about what I want
Take all the time that you need
Baby I don't want to rush
Just let it be what its gonna be

I see your trying to keep your cool
But your making yourself look like a fool
No matter what you do (I know you hate this but)
Baby you can't fight the truth
The truth is so good that were meant to be baby
This is destine its gonna happen
You might as well give in and stop playing with love
You need to stop what your doing can't you see I'm hurting
Baby I'mma give it some time

You can act if you want
You can try to run away from me
I know I got what you want
Give it time and you'll see
Its not about what I want
Take all the time that you need
Baby I don't want to rush
Just let it be what its gonna be
