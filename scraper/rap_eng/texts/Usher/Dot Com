[Verse 1:]
Oooh, I love the way you dirty type
I can take you home or escape
Oooh, I need your backspace in my life
Thank God you don't have a flat screen

[Pre-Hook:]
Please, baby I got to see you
I really want to please you
So get on my laptop so I can download

[Hook:]
Online, I love the way you log on
We can do it all night
I'll make you dot com
Baby, if you sign on
I'ma make you light up
Oooh, baby if you sign on
I'll make you dot com

[Verse 2:]
I wanted to link up with you baby at first sight
With you I get to use my F-keys
I can't wait to give you megabytes
I got all the memory you'll need
Let my fingers do the talking baby

[Pre-Hook:]

[Hook:]

[Bridge]
Oooh, baby you want this I know
I can't wait to give you my hard-drive
My moonlight
If it's all right, baby
I'm always at your window
Ready to shift and control you
If you want me to
Say yes, baby
Say yes, baby
Say yes, baby
Say yes, baby
You gotta say, oooh

Say yes, baby
Say yes, baby
You got to say yes
Yes

Please, baby I got to see you
I really want to please you
So get up on me baby, get up on me
I really want you
