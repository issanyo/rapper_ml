I fell in love with shawty when I seen her on the dance floor
She was dancin' sexy, p-p-poppin', droppin', droppin' low
Never, ever has a lady hit me on the first sight
This was something special, this was just like dynamite
Honey got a booty like pow, pow, poOOOOwwww
Honey got some boobies like wow, oh, wow
Girl, you know I'm lovin' your, lovin' your style
Check, check, check, check, check-checkin' you out, like
Oh, she got it all
Sexy from her head to toe
And I want it all and all and all
