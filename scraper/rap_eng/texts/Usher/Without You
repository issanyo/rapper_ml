[Verse 1]
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Chorus]
Without you, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

[Verse 2]
Can't erase, so I'll take place
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soare, I won't climb
If your not here, I'm parelized
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
Lost my hart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Chorus]
Without you, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

Without you, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

[Outro]
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
Without you
