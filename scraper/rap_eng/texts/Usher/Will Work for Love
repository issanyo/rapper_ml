[Verse 1]
Can you help me?
Anybody out there help me
Please, can you help me?
Excuse me mister, I fell on hard times
I need some help, but don't need a dime
Don't turn away, I'll wash your clothes
If you let me stay, I'll find your remote

[Bridge]
Day after day, people walk by
I can't catch their eyes, I pull out my sign

[Chorus]
It says: "will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Verse 2]
Can you help me?
Anybody out there help me
Please, can you help me?
Excuse me, you two, got love to spare?
Search my whole heart, it ain't none in there
Pardon me, sister, I'm on my last
Don't have no love, that's okay, God bless

[Bridge]
Day after day, people walk by
I can't catch their eyes, I pull out my sign

[Chorus]
It says: "will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Bridge]
I remember the day I lost my heart
Took it for granted, I went too far
Fall down, cried, and then begged
To feel that love again
I hold on this sign till the very end
Do anything

[Chorus]
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love overtime
Babe, it says: "Will work for love"
I will, I will, I will
I'll work for love for all my life
I will work for love

[Outro]
Help me, I will work for love
