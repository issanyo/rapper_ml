[Usher]
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

[Josh Kaufman]
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

[Usher]
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me

[Josh Kaufman]
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

[Both]
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

[Usher]
Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face

[Josh Kaufman]
I look around but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace

[Both]
I keep crying baby, baby please

[Josh Kaufman]
Oh, can't you see
You belong to me

[Usher]
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

[Josh Kaufman]
Every move you make

[Usher]
Every vow you break

[Josh Kaufman]
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

[Usher]
Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

[Josh Kaufman]
I'll be watching you

[Usher]
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break
I'll be watching you

[Josh Kaufman]
Every single day
Every word you say
Every game you play
I'll be watching you

[Usher]
Every move you make
Every vow you break
Every smile you fake

[Josh Kaufman]
I'll be watching

[Usher]
I'll be watching

[Josh Kaufman]
Every breath you take
Every move you make
Every bond you break

[Both]
I'll be watching you
