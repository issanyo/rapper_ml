[Intro:]
Yeah
Usher
Yeah

[Verse:]
Everyday he wakes up in his million dollar home
His life is like a video, the only reality he knows
He jumps inside of his hundred thousand dollar car
Cruising up the boulevard
Driving pass people living hard
Complains about the gas prices but still supports the war
He complains about his 6-figure salary, tax to feed the poor
He doesn't understand the homeless, doesn't think it's genocide
That millions die from three lethal letters
He does sh** to make it better (shhh)
And I'm thinking of you

[Chorus:]
Everyone wants to touch the sky
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly
Everybody wants heaven
If you don't want to sacrifice
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

[Verse 2:]
She watches television full of fabricated show
Thinks the world is just a joke, but oh little does she know
That there is a real life drama happening right outside her door
'Cause She continues to ignore, but she's like the tv-! the story repeats
She's searching through the channels
Skipping pass the news, she's more entertained by lies and gossip
'Cause it hurts to see the truth
She complains about the nation
Think it's a waste of time to vote
She says the one that has been corrupted forever
No one tries to make it better
And I'm thinking who

[Chorus:]
Everyone wants to touch the sky (Oh-ho)
Nobody wants to reach back
For the ones who are scared to fly (Scared to fly)
Everybody wants heaven (Heaven)
If you don't want to sacrifice (Oh)
Don't say nothing, don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing (My hand to my brother)
Oooooo-Hush (Hand to my sister)
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing
Oooooo-Hush
Don't say nothing

Yeah, yeah
