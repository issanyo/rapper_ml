[Intro]
What's up, baby?
I'm so glad I got you here
I'm so in love with you
And I don't ever wanna lose you
I wanna take this to the next level
I hope you ready

[Verse 1]
Now that you're here
I got something to say, baby
I think that you should know
You're doing the most, sugar
So don't worry 'bout the situation
I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, if I go there, baby, with you?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
(Oh, I hear you talking, babe)
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?

[Bridge 1]
Wooooo, baby
You say all the time you only want the best of my love
Now I can see that there's only one way to tear it up
I'm willing to tell you everything I let stand between us
But what if I tell you too much?

[Verse 2]
What about you, babe?
Will you tell me all the freaky things you are?
Before I do, need you to know
If we make it through, our love will grow
Imagine how amazing things would be

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
(Oh, I hear you talking, babe)
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby, can you handle?

[Bridge 2]
I fear sometimes in my mind
That you won't wanna stay with my love
Oh baby, if I can be sure
Inside out that you know exactly the man that comes to see you
I'll go deep as I can
Giving you the rest of my love
But what if I tell you too much?

[Verse 3]
So much to explore
So much we have yet to discover
I ask myself, "Should I go there?
Should I do it?"
Can I give it to you fully?
Can you handle it?

[Chorus]
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' lay it out, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
I can handle it, I can go there, baby, with you
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby, can you handle?

[Outro]
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle? (Oh, I need to know)
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby can you handle? (Can you handle it?)
Can you handle it, can I go there, baby, with you?
We gon' set it off, we gon' tear it up
Baby, can you handle?
We gon' set it out, we gon' work it out
Baby can you handle?
