[Intro]
You gonna say something to the people?

[Chorus]
Prayer for you
A prayer to you
Do I sound that bad?

[Verse 1]
Just the simple thought of you means everything
To my life you give meaning you're the best thing
So precious, my gift for life
That's why I send you up this prayer
I pray for your protection, your covering
That everything intended for you, you'll receive
And I'll believe He'll guide you
Lord, honor my prayer

[Chorus]
Prayer for you
A prayer to you
I pray for you
Pray for you

[Verse 2]
I'll do my best to be there for you every day
To be what my father wished he was to me
Baby, I got you
Daddy, you'll be there (I'll be there)
To encourage you to be the best you can be
You carry my name, I pray that you're better than me

[Outro]
I ain't going nowhere, even when I get on your nerves
'Cause I'm your daddy
My prayer for you
Son, I pray for you
