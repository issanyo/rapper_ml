[Verse 1]
Cut me, cut me with your tongue, then love me when its over
You don't even know just how you much you taunt me
Taunting and provoking, keep words unspoken
Pandora's box is open

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

[Verse 2]
Piercing, piercing with my actions, spitefully ignore you
I don't even care just how much you take
Bitten and it's potent, you hate it and I know it
Pandora's box is open

[Pre-Chorus]
Blame brings pain
Accusations seal these walls
Walls built up to shield from pain
Pain of finding fault, revolving back to pain
And we need to stop

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe

[Bridge]
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
It won't ever come down
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
These walls get higher baby
It won't ever come down
'Round and 'round like the game roulette
Step on up, kid, and place your bet
'Round and 'round is the route we choose
Play that game, man, we all gon' lose
'Round and 'round like the game roulette
Step on up, kid, and place your bet
'Round and 'round is the route we choose
Play that game, man, we all gon' lose

[Chorus]
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but I'd rather resolve it, babe
Just like a revolver babe, just like a revolver (it goes around)
Just like a revolver babe, but we gotta resolve it, babe
