[Intro: Usher]
Hey, girl
Hey, hey
Hey, girl
Hey, hey
Hey, girl

[Verse 1: Usher]
What's your name? Baby, what's your number?
'Cause, girl, you got me, you got a brother wondering
If you want a homie and a lover
I can be your friend till the end

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, what's up?
I'm going crazy
Hey, girl, what's up?
'Cause I wanna know if I can love you
Yo, girl, what's up?
Yo, won't you be my lady, yeah?
Hey, girl, what's up?
I wanna know who you are
What's your name?
I wanna know who you are
What's your name?
I wanna know who you are
And make you a star
Girl, I'm giving you everything
'Cause my love is yours

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
What's your name and number?
Damn, your double deed is making Willie mumble
Jilie jolies, I'm a rock it, yo, like we get dumb
What's your digit? Put it in my phone
Hit me when you're all alone
You could call on me
We'll flirt through technology, girl

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, what's up?
I'm going crazy
Hey, girl, what's up?
'Cause I wanna know if I can love you
Yo, girl, what's up?
Yo, won't you be my lady, yeah?
Hey, girl, what's up?
I wanna know who you are
What's your name?
I wanna know who you are
What's your name?
I wanna know who you are
And make you a star
Girl, I'm giving you everything
'Cause my love is yours

[Bridge: Usher]
What's your name? Baby, what's your number?
'Cause, girl, you got me, you got a brother wondering
If you want a homie and a lover
I can be your friend till the end

[Verse 3: Usher]
Would it, should it be a problem
If I holler, "Ãµcomo se llama?"
Would you bother, like Donna Summers?
Girl, give me this last dance
We slowly skating, babe, don't wanna float away
'Cause we got the light, you be the ball, and I'ma be the chain, babe
Now, rotate (round and round and round)
You got nowhere to go, babe
Illuminate and create a new thing
Let them paparazzi this you and me thing
But we can't do a thing till I know your name

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, what's up?
I'm going crazy
Hey, girl, what's up?
'Cause I wanna know if I can love you
Yo, girl, what's up?
Yo, won't you be my lady, yeah?
Hey, girl, what's up?
I wanna know who you are

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Hey, bitch, let's get with it
'Cause you ti-tick did it

The honey put it on me now im speakin like th-this

Take silicon and I'm a ling ging starter

[Chorus: Usher]
What's your name?

I wanna know who you are
And make you a star
Girl, I'm giving you everything
'Cause my love is yours
