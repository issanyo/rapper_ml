[Intro: Usher (Rico Love)]
Peace up!  Y'all know what it is!
Usher baby!
(Uhhh...)
They ain't ready for this one, shawty...
Yeah, mean!
(Uhhh...)
Haha!
This is a
J-Lack Track, man!

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
Now, you should've seen her peepin' my demeanor
I think she wanted me to put something in between her
She seen that glitter shinin' on my pinky finger
And now she wishin' I could rock her and lean her
And I don't sip champagne, it's wine now
Lookin' for a thick young thing to wind down
She gave me some brain, I know what's on her mind now
Dealin' with a lame, but he don't gotta find out!
I'm outside by the car with the tennis shoes laced up
Mirror for a rearview; you can fix your makeup
Caked up, draped up, dripped out
Sorta like a rainbow when I pull my fist out, wrist out
You can keep the Cristal, just give me a water
'Cause I'm headin' for the border with the mother of your daughter!
Chill, baby, I got a new plan
We don't need a roof and, my nigga, you can
C-c-c-c-catch me!

[Hook: Usher (Rico Love)]
Catch me in the streets where they know me
Eyes low and I'm ridin' with the homie
Woodgrain grippin' when we rollin'
Pimpin', what you sayin'?
Pimpin', what you sayin'?
Listen how the mile per hour's knockin'
We keepin' it movin', beatin' down the block, man
(Uh, Young Vega, I see you, my nigga!)
We got the game on lock, man!
Pimpin', what you sayin'?
Pimpin', what you sayin'?

[Verse 2: Rico Love]
Now I'm a Chevy ridin' hot boy, swagger like I'm Jagger
Plus I'm rockin' rolling stones and my money don't stop, boy
Used to ride in Pontiacs, now I'm at the Body Tap
Shinin', standin' by a mami who can make her body clap
Searcy got a bunch of ones, Ursher got a bunch of ones
I ain't frontin' none, nigga, we gon' have a bunch of fun!
And every day I laugh, every day I'm makin' cash
Tryin' to figure out another way to make them haters mad!
I laugh at you niggas! (Ha ha ha ha ha) and
When I pull them cars up out of my garage and
I ain't flougin', Murda got the lambo and
He can fit that muhfucka up in my apartment!
Broads swingin' on my balls like they lady Tarzans
Niggas take precautions, they don't wanna cross him
Call him awesome, every day I'm flossin'
Tried to catch a winner, baby girl, you done caught him
Chuuch!

[Hook]

[Rico Love over hook]
Uh-huh
Ridin' with the homie
What you sayin'?
What you sayin?
Heh!
Beatin' down the block, man!
Uhh!
Yo Usher
Tell 'em somethin', man!

[Verse 3: Usher]
Headed down south, down I-85, we rollin' and
We on the lookout for them boys patrollin'
'Woofers jumpin' from the sound that's comin' up out the speakers
Ridin' dirty in Impalas and SXes and Regals
Look how the chrome from the tailpipe glisten in the midnight
Holla at me when you see me skatin' through the red light!
On Kakunas, big wheelers, bendin' the curb
Workin' that woodgrain, look how many lanes I'm swervin'!
Every time I make a pit stop, I know they gon' flock
Cut my music off, get back, get back and let the top drop
Dimes get low for me, poppin' and shakin'
'Cause they like the way my decibels is crackin' the pavement
In my old school' ride, man, they call me Earthquake
I got trucks choppin' on 24 blades
Hop in my slab, ridin' down through Cascade's
747 in my truck on the runway, and you can...

[Hook]

[Rico Love over hook]
Scottie Knoxx, I see you!
Uh
Now what you sayin'?
What you sayin'?
Heh!
We keepin' it movin', beatin' down the block, man!
Uhh
Usher
Rico Love
Uhh!

[Outro: Rico Love]
Turn the lights on
This is a J-Lack track, man!
