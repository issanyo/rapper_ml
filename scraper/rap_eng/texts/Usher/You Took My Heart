[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

[Verse 1]
It's not the way that I feel
'Cause I'm really in love with you
You stole my heart, then you ran away
What am I to say? I love you anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you will never change
My love for you will never change
'Cause I still feel the same way
The love I have for you will never grow old
I will always be there for you

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

[Verse 2]
My life has changed because of you
And I need you right here with me
There's no substitute for you
Far as I can see, you're the one for me

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you will never change
My love for you will never change
'Cause I still feel the same way
The love I have for you will never grow old
I will always be there for you

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you

[Bridge]
I don't know why you left me all alone
I'm thinking about you, baby
Every night and day, thinking of you by my side
Here with me is where you ought to be
Every night and day, thinking of you by my side
Here with me is where you ought to be

[Chorus]
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
You took my heart and ran away
Forever in my heart, you'll stay
No matter what we've been through
I'm going to keep on loving you
