She don't know that she making me want her

[Verse: Ludacris]
Get me bodied like Beyoncé
I beat it up like Bangladesh, Shondrae
"Can you smell what I'm cooking?" like The Rock say
Smells like a feast and you looking like the entrée (bon appétit)
These other women just hors d'oeuvres
I picked you and that's what's getting on these whores' nerves
'Cause I be at like subpoenas when the court serves
Give me, give me love like Serena when the court serves
'Cause she don't know that she got me wanna get frisky
'Cause pineapple juice with Conjure, got her tipsy
And so I order more bottles of that good stuff
It's Ludacris, women call me Mr. Good Stuff
So I'm a take her to the rooftop, rooftop
Girl's so cold, I need a flu shot, flu shot
She said she want me to take her to the shoe shop, shoe shop
But I told her keep her head up, 2Pac, 2Pac

[Bridge: Usher]
Girl, I'm gonna make this dilemma the best way that I know how
'Cause you're killin me with it, you're just a problem that I can't put down
'Cause every time, you get too far away
She can tell I got something missing, it be all up in my face
