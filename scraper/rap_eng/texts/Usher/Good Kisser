[Intro]
Make every minute worth it, baby
This for Usher, baby
Watch this

[Hook]
I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessing that it's true, huh
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you, ha
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, uh ha

[Verse 1]
It's 5 in the morning
Kush is rolling while she's making steak and eggs, yeah
At 5 in the morning
We can only be about to do one thing (what?)

[Refrain]
See, I told her, the devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

[Pre-Ch­orus 1]
I think that she's a winner
She could be a keeper

[Ch­orus]
'Cause she's such a good kisser
Got lipstick on my leg
Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'ma rain on this parade
Oh baby

[Hook]
I done been around the world, I done kissed a lot of girls
So I'm guessing that it's true, huh
Make me holla and I bet a million dollars
Don't nobody kiss it like you, ha
Don't nobody kiss it like you
Don't nobody kiss it like you, bang, bang, bang
Don't nobody kiss it like you, don't nobody kiss it like you, uh ha

[Verse 2]
This girl, she's my hero
Get dinero, euros, pesos, francs and yen, ha
(I ain't one to trick off either)
I'm staring at your barrel
Pull the trigger, chitty, chitty, bang, babe
(Whatever you want, I told her)

[Refrain]
See, I told her, the devil is a lie
Them other girls can't compete with mine
You do it so good, you fuck my mind
You pull it out, then you open wide
You make me wanna tap out and retire
Your pretty lips leave me so inspired

[Pre-Ch­orus 2]

[Ch­orus]
'Cause she's such a good kisser

Oh baby
She's such a good kisser
I'ma rain on this parade
Oh baby

[Verse 3]
Listen, the only thing I know
You give it to me, baby, with good flow
Don't ever run it back, come on, keep going
Just give it to me, give it up to me, give it up to me
I, I can't keep my control
Every time that I see you hit that floor
She keep on giving it to me, I want more
Now come on baby, now give it to me, give it up to me
Heeyyy yeah

[Bridge]
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night
Kiss it good, kiss it right
Keep it up, we be kissing all night

[Ch­orus]
