Can’t even look her in the face
Too busy staring at her waist line (waist line)
And I ain’t too proud to chase
Knowing the chances are, she’ll take mine
Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know (I know)
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in the rapture
But I won’t let go

Oh, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore
Left my heart on the floor
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took my heart on the floor

Behind the smile and the laughter
There’s danger, I know
I know I’ll end up her capture
Caught in a rapture
But I won’t let go

Woah, why, mi amor?
What you doing take my heart for?
Why, mi amor?
You took it knowing that it’s not yours
Why, mi amor?
You caught me from the door, whoa
So tell me why, mi amor?
You’re so easy to adore?
Left my heart on the floor
