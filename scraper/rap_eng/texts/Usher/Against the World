[Verse 1]
These days it's hard to find someone to love
Once you find them you don't wanna give up
And now I know that we're both alone in this
It's just me and you against the world!
And there's me and there's you
It's just me and you gainst the world!

[Verse 2]
Oh, girl!
And what am I supposed to do?
The alarms are going off in my head
And it's dangerous
Yes, it's complicated
We're the only ones who get it
The only ones that want this
The only ones who believe in love!

[Chorus]
It's just the two of us getting into love
It takes two of us to change the world
I've got you, you've got me
It's just me and you against the world!

[Bridge]
Girl, you got me so crazy in longing
And I know it's wrong but so right
And I'm holding you
I have been dreaming
And I can't let you go
Now you're mine!
Girl, what am I supposed to do?
The alarms are going off in my head!

[Chorus] (2x) [Fade out to end]
