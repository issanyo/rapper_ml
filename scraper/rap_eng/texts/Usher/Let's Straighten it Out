Monica:
Sit yourself down boy and talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't keep on telling me everything's okay
Cause if it was then you wouldn't be crying
You been acting real funny when I see you lately
Sitting around poutin' all day long
Now how in the world do you expect me to understand
When I not even know what's wrong

Chorus:
Straighten it out, let's straighten it out
Let's straighten it out(Monica: Baby)
Let's straighten it out(Monica: Out....)
Let's straighten it out
Usher:
For the last few days when I saw you baby
Oh I admit something just wasn't right
It's so many things going through my head
I didn't want to start another fight
But if your tired of people being bothered baby
In the world we'd be all alone
Instead of being apart of a problem baby
You and me otta be getting along, yeah....
