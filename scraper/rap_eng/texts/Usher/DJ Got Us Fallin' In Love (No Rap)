[Intro]
Usher, Usher, Usher
Yeah, man

[Verse 1]
So we back in the club
With our bodies rocking from
Side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie
Gone back to life, back-back to life

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, go on, get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Verse 2]
Keep downing drinks like there's no tomorrow
There's just right, now, now, now, na-na-now, now
Gon' set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherfucker
Down, down, down, da-da-down, down

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hands up
When the music drops, we both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I've seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, go on, get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Oh

[Verse 3]
Usher, Usher, Usher, usher
Yeah, yeah
Usher, Usher, Usher, usher
DJ's yeah
Usher, Usher, Usher, usher
All around the world
Usher, Usher, Usher, Usher
Listen
Hands up
Now when the music drops, I wanna see your hands up

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love, falling in love
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, go on, get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, go on, get you right
'Cause baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

[Outro]
Yeah
Thank you, DJ
