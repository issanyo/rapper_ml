Don't let me down, down
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
Don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Down,down,down,down,down,down,down,down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down,down, down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
