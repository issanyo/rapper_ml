(Verse 1: Yamine)
Uh, baby girl let me touch that sexy body
You over here up and down that pole for my freaking Rarri hey
What do you like
What do you need
You need a mic
On this balcony
Hey
I don't know what I'm talking bout
I've been srubbing walls for a couple change in the South
Hey
Oh what do you mean?
Yamine been down the row between 2 to 4 teams
They strippin
They know I'm tippin'
4 rounds and they trickin'
Thotting the thots smoking the pot
For Pippen
I don't know what I'm whipping in this kitchen
40 hoes for this dick I'm gon' swimming
I don't ever stop it
Cuz me and Usher made this song
For this girl can be on my Rocket
The one I stick in the socket
Naw nigga she gone for the week
While me and Usher go on team fleet
Hey
She fresh and so clean

(Hook: Usher)
We do it in the shower
On the counter
On the floor
Then well make it to the bed
I just want to test it me
Then we'll do it so the world can see
On the balcony, balcony (repeat)

(Verse 2: Yamine)
Hey girl what you like?
I need a couple rounds for this sprite
I had 4 hoes last night
I'm so sorry baby I was getting it right
(yeah bro)
Last mixtape was fire
And I never retire
Me and Usher in the aisle
And they know I'm an owl
I've been looking all day with a flashlight
Young ass girl that loves to bite
She knows that she loves me
I've been loving this girl all day
And she know that I love her
And she loves me so cove her


(Hook: Usher)
We do it in the shower
On the counter
On the floor
Then well make it to the bed
I just want to test it me
Then we'll do it so the world can see
On the balcony, balcony (repeat)
