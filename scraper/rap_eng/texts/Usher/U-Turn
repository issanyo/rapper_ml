[Intro: Usher]
Yeah, ayo
2000, it's us
Yo, it's time to U-Turn
You heard me?
You're either with us or against us

[Verse 1: Usher]
It's been some years now
Since we hit the floor to get down
We always had a step to go with the sound
Now everybody wanna sit around, drink and ball
Remember the snake
And how the floor used to clear and everybody would break
What's crunk now used to be called getting to it
I'm bringing it all back, this is how we do it
Just...

[Chorus: Usher]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

[Verse 2: Usher]
In the '80s, fresh was the talk
MJ had everybody doing the moonwalk
In the '90s, I had a high flat top
Doing the wop, Pee-Wee to the Reebok
I can't forget about my high school days
The sound was Bobby Brown, the dance was the running man
Now everybody wanna push Bentley's
The year is 2, everybody, do the U-Turn

[Chorus]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

[Bridge: Usher]
All you need to do is let go
Let the tempo take over you
I came to have a good time
Let the rhythm deep inside your soul
Let it lead you to the floor, come on

[Chorus: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, get down with me
Come on, come on, it ain't to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn

[Chorus]
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Put your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's called the U-Turn
Get your hands up, bend your knees
Bounce around in a circle, getting down with me
Come on, come on, it's not hard to learn
Come on, come on, it's...
