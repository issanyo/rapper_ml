Its like whatever I do
Just can't get through to you
Im never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found

I lost my way, she said shed stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold

That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back

I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to travel through
But its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains, hey

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be

She, she dont touch me, I dont touch her
We ain't really ever say a word
I really wanna give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the girl

She thinks that Im full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man Im tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl you know Im trying

You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it

Cause we will never be the same
Ive been standing in gas
And you have been the flame

So I know sorry, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain
Its like moving mountains

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains

Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be

This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together baby yeah

And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love, I'm down on my luck
Ooh, I'm done, oh

I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving a mountain
I'm trying to move this mountain

Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be, oh
Baby baby
