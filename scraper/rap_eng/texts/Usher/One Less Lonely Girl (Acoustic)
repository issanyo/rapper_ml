[Intro]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl

[Verse 1]
How many I told you's and start overs and shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises? Be honest girl, how many tears you let hit the floor?
How many bags you packed just to take 'em back tell me that? How many either or's?
But no more, if you let me inside of your world there'll be the one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces, now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Verse 2]
Christmas wasn't merry, 14th of February, not one of 'em spent with you
How many dinner dates, set dinner plates and he didn't even touch his food?
How many torn photographs are you taping back? Tell me that, couldn't see an open door
But no more, if you let me inside of your world, there'll be one less lonely girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh no, saw so many pretty faces, now all I see is you
Oh no, don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine in the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl

[Bridge]
I can fix up your broken heart, I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe, I just wanna set one girl free to fall
She's free to fall with me, her hearts locked and know what, I got the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl, one less lonely girl

[Chorus]
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
One less lonely girl, one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world, there's gonna be one less lonely girl
