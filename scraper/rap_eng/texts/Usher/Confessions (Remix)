Feat. Jermaine Dupri, Kanye West, Shyne, Twista

[Intro - J.D.]
Uh, listen up listen up listen up world
Listen up listen up listen up world, uh, I gotta confess
This the hottest remix I ever did in my life so so def

[Verse One - Shyne] (J.D.) {*Shyne on the phone*}
Sittin in my cell, head about to burst
Wouldn't be alive if I didn't shoot first
Had it made, sorry for the ricochet
Would I be here today if I didn't let it spray
I never said that I was perfect
Nobody walkin on this earth is
At night, I would've gotten murdered
If I ain't grab the hatchet and let them cowards have it
(Ohh, that's the boy Shyne y'all
It's ya boy on his way home man, the boy on his way home man)

[Chorus - Usher] (Kanye West) These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all yeah, yeah)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions

Chorus - Usher] (J.D.)
These are my confessions, just when I thought I said all I can say
My chick on the side, said she got one on the way (yeah)
These are my confessions, man I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all, (all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (call)
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confession

[J.D. - Talking]
If you got something to confess to right now step to the mic Twista

[Verse Two - Twista]
I confess about the incident when I was with a shorty in the Lexus coupe
Ya homie said she saw me but she didn't have proof
But I knew I really should've just been tellin' you the truth
And I confess about the days I was rollin' my Seville with the custom gold grill
I was in the field still lookin' for a thrill
And I knew it was bogus I should've kept it real
And I confess that, just when I thought I could really try to get away
While havin other women on the side
But I never knew that it would catch up wit' a nigga one day
You gotta hear me girl, I done learned a lesson'
If you stay with me then it'll be a blessin', no stressing
It'll never be no guessin'
Cause I pulled one out my heart and these are my confessions

[Verse Three - Kanye West]
Yeah Kanye To tha College Dropout
Man, how does she bring it up how does she break it down
Man you at the clinic, dawg slow down that's yo child
But if you keep it, then you gotta tell your girl you was cheatin
And you went raw dog when you beat it
That's when she gon' tell you to beat it
You know it ain't y'all little secret
You famous you can't go nowhere cause everytime you go there
There's hoes there so basiclly you and your girl over
I know when she broke the news you told her "man don't say that"
Matter fact like Pat, don't say jack
Everytime a nigga sittin on paychecks
Things come up from way way way back I confess
