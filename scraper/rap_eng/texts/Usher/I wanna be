This is what you do

Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationshipwith you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one Im with
Start a new realtionship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse1)
Before anything came between us
You were like my bestfriend
The one I used to run to when me and my
Girl was having problems (thats right)
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I come home at night and lay my head down
Sll I seem to think about is you
And how you make me wanna

(Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new realtionship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse2)
Now what's bad
Is your'e the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
What should I do
Should I
Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I
Do exactly what I feel inside
Cause I
I don't wanna go
Don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (oh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Verse 3)
At this point
The situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her but I
Gotta let her go
And if she may not understand it
Why all of this is going on
I tried
I tried to fight it but the feelings just to strong

You make me wanna wanna
You make me wanna

Chorus
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about her and the things that come along with
You make me
You make me

(Repeat)
