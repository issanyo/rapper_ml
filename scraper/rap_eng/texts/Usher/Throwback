Real talk
Usher, Just Blaze
You know

[Intro: Usher & Sample]
Oh, oh ohh
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
You're gonna need me, need me one day
And now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears, right?!
Mmm, you're gonna want me back

[Verse 1: Usher]
You never miss a good thing 'til it leaves ya
And finally, I realized that I need ya
I want you back
Baby girl, I need you back
Gotta have you back, babe
Heartbroken when you left my world
Man, I wish I would've kept my girl
And I love you
I don't know what I'm gon' do without my baby

[Chorus: Usher]
It's driving me crazy (it's driving me crazy)
Because I'm missing my baby (missing my baby)
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, ohhooo
Said, I'm about to go crazy (about to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needing you lately (needing you lately)
I'm going out of my head and all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

[Bridge 1: Usher & Sample]
Aww, baby, what you say now?
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
And still I want you, want you, want you, want you, want you
I, need you, babe

[Verse 2: Usher]
If I could rewind the time and get inside your mind
I would take back all my words
I didn't see it
I couldn't see what I was doing, babe
See, baby girl, I was blind and I wish I could try
To be the man that you deserve
Give me one chance to make it work, ah baby

[Chorus: Usher]
It's driving me crazy (it's driving me crazy)
Because I'm missing my baby (missing my baby)
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
Oh, I just wish I could find you, girl, oh I
Said, I'm about to go crazy (about to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needing you lately (needing you lately)
I'm going out of my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them now

[Bridge 2: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Wish I could throw it back
I want it the way it used to be, OH, oooohh
You're gonna need me, need me one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
Give me one chance to make it work

[Chorus: Usher & Sample]
It's driving me crazy (it's driving me crazy)
Because I'm missing my baby (missing my baby) yeah
Going out of my mind, running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl, ah baby
Said, I'm about to go crazy (about to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needing you lately (needing you lately)
The love of my life
But I wasn't loving you right, baby, yeeaah
It's driving me crazy (it's driving me crazy)
Because I'm missing my baby (missing my baby)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm going out of my mind and I'm running out of time
I just wish I could find you, girl (you're gonna need me)
Said, I'm about to go crazy (about to go crazy)
'Cause I've been needing you lately (needing you lately)
(Mmm, you're gonna want me back)
I'm going out of my head, all the things that I said
I wish that I never said them noooww

[Outro: Usher & Sample]
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
It's the last words she said to me
Now I'm wishing she was still here with me
You're gonna need me, need me one day
Now that day's here, your man gotta shed tears
Mmm, you're gonna want me back
I'm sitting by the phone
Realizing she ain't ever coming home...
Oooohhhhhhhh, aaahhh, ouuuuuu, ouuuu
You're gonna need me, need me one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back...
