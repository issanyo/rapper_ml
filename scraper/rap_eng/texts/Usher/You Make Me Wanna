[Intro]
Before anything
The one I’m with
Anything
Relationship

Before anything
The one I’m with
Anything
Relationship

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

[Verse 1]
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
But when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about was you

[Chorus]
How you make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

[Verse 2]
Now what’s bad
Is you’re the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should’ve been you
And what’s sad is that I love her but I’m falling for you
What should I do, should I
Tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I do exactly what I feel inside?
Cause I don’t wanna go
Don’t need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

[Verse 3]
At this point
The situation’s out of control
I never meant to hurt her
But I gotta let her go
And she may not understand
While all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight
But the feeling’s just to strong

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I’m with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me

{Outro]
(Think about it, think about you)
You know you make me wanna
You know you make me wanna
You know you make me wanna
You make me wanna leave!
