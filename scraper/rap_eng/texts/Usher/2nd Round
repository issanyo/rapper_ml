[Intro: Usher]
Just touched down in town again
You think about me now and then
Been missing my lover friend
Let's say we have a second round again
(Yeah, Usher, baby
I love all my friends)

[Verse 1: Usher]
Girl, it's been a while
So I thought I'd hit you up
You never left my mind
Let's pick it up where we left off
The last time I left you thirsty, baby
So let me fill you up
Yeah, it's been a minute
I know you miss the way we touch
You can think about you don't want it
You don't wanna come across too anxious
Gonna see if you're ready for the second round

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember
Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girl

[Verse 2: Usher]
Said you wouldn't, but you did it, oh girl
I can tell you don't regret it 'cause you ain't been touched like this
Since the last time
The feeling that I get every time we connect, oh, there it is
One more kiss and I'm out, but I'll be back around
Baby, you can hang around if you want to
But I gotta be out, handle some B.I
When I get back, get ready for the second round

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember
Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girl

[Bridge: Usher]
Just touched down in town again
You think about me now and then
Been missing my lover friend
Let's say we have a second round again

[Chorus: Usher]
Girl, I'm in your town, come over
Girl, don't let me down, I won't be here for long
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember
Girl, give me your best, expect none less, girl
