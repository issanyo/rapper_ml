[Intro]
Oh baby, my lady
You like what you're hearing, baby?
What's going on?
I've seen you around my way a couple times
You must have just moved around the way, right?
I see all the fellows have been pressing you for your number
I'd like to get to know you, so um...
Maybe we can spend some time and just talk on the phone or something

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Verse 1]
Girl, you look surprised, I've got conversation
'Cause you ain't checking for the kids I swing with, no
Girl, can't we please get past impressions?
'Cause what I feel for you, I swear is legit
Your girls tell you watch him, he's an entertainer
They say I'll hurt you and break your heart
They don't know, well, well, just what I'm feeling
From the first time I saw you, I loved you from the very start

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Verse 2]
I saw you 'round my way and I had to meet you
But I've got to let you know I'm just somebody
Who wants to care for you with lots of love and patience
So please understand why I'm taking my time
I'm falling deeper and deeper and deeper, yeah, baby
And I'm so glad we had this conversation
Because girl, when it comes to you, there's no confusion
And I can't get it in your head and I'm having a fit

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Bridge 1]
Young lady (young lady)
I miss you in my life
I'm on a mission just to please you right
Sweet lady (sweet, sweet lady)
The thought of no you cuts just like a knife
Cuts like a knife

[Bridge 2]
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within
It's you for me and me for you
But first we must be friends
I'll keep my love coming and coming and coming
Girl, we can win

[Chorus]
I can think of many ways to say "I love you"
And with those many ways, there comes a time
For me to say I'll put no girl before you
So pretty lady, make up your mind

[Bridge 2/Outro]
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within
It's you for me and me for you
But first we must be friends
I'll keep my love coming and coming and coming
Girl, we can win
Girl, I've learned my lesson
No, we can't let others in
Misery loves some company
They don't see it's from within
It's you for me and me for you...
