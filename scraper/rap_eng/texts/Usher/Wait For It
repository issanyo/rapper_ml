[Intro]
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it

[Verse 1]
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
Well he can keep all of Georgia
'Cause Theodosia, she's mine

[Chorus 1]
Love don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep lovin' anyway
We laugh and we cry and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
I'm willing to wait for it
Then, I'm willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

[Verse 2]
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher, preacher, preacher, preacher
But there are things that the homilies and hymns won't teach ya, teach ya, teach ya, teach ya
My mother was a genius, genius, my father commanded respect, respect
When they died they left no instructions, just a legacy to protect

[Chorus 2]
Death don’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
Yeah, we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
Then I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it...

[Bridge]
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am the one thing in life I can control
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am inimitable, I am original
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not falling behind or running late
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
I am not standing still, I am lying in wait
(Wait for it, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for it)
Everyone faces an endless uphill climb
You got something to prove, you got nothing to lose
Everyone’s pace is relentless, you waste no time, time
What is it like in his shoes?

[Chorus 3]
Life don't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
Taking me, taking me, taking...
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
But I know there's a reason I'm alive
So many have died
And I'm still waiting for it
I'm willing to wait for it

[Chorus 2]
Life don’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
If there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it (Yes I am)
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it

[Outro]
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it, wait for it, wait for it
