[Intro: Usher]
I fucked up
I'm man enough to admit it
(I had it coming)
But I don't know if that makes a difference
(In time I'll show you)
And I know better
If you just give me a chance to explain
(That counts for something, need you)
I was just... I'm insecure...
I need you

[Verse 1: Usher]
How you make it feel
Way you make me feel
Said, feels so good
I like it, I like it, baby
Girl, what you doing to me
Girl, what you do to me
Don't give 'em my love
You ain't even like that
What kind of point you trying to prove?
And you hate to admit it
But you still take me back
All that shit you was talking
It don't hold no weight 'cause

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
Man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

[Verse 2: Usher]
Girl, what I do to you
Girl, what I do to you
Do to make it this cold
Trying to get me where it hit home
You ain't even like that, I know
You ain't mean it, I know, yeah
New friends, you got new friends
They already know who heâ€™s hitting
Better answer when a real one calling
You know who it is when you see me calling, huh
Yeah, I know I was wrong, but you knew better
Give you up, I would never

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
Yet I, man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, oh hold me down
Oh help me out

[Bridge: Usher]
Haven't always done you right and I know it, hah
I hope it ain't too late for me to show it
(Don't say goodbye)
Forgive me for what I put you through
Let me love you better
All this time (you, were, right)
You were right

[Chorus: Usher]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time, I'll show you)
I ain't always wrong, I take the blame (that counts for something)
I'll man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(It's gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Ah baby, I need you, ah baby, I need you
Help me out
Don't let me down

[Outro: Priyanka Chopra]
Everybody wants somebody that's got confidence
He should make me feel safe, make me laugh
Everything about him should feel sexy
His walk, his talk
He's gotta be effortless, you know?
Not trying too hard
What do you want in someone?
