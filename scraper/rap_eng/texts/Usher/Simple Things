[Intro]
Yeah, ahh
They say money can't buy you love
They say money can't buy you love
They never seem to listen
I'm all ears

[Verse 1]
Just copped your girl a brand new Rolex
But you can never find the time to spend at home
Thinking that's gon' keep her happy
When time is all she wanted all along

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Verse 2]
So you think that you know what's important
Steady chasing your fame and your fortune
But you don't know you're chasing a dime, losing a treasure
Those dollars don't make sense to me at all
Ooh, it goes (duh da, duh da)
You give her spending money (duh da, duh da)
But all she wanna spend is time alone (tonight)
Keep giving her (the finer things, but)
But she don't really need that (if you don't stop, you're)
You're gonna end up alone (alone)
In a world without love (duh duh da, duh da)
Why would you do it?

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Bridge]
Stop trying to buy her love
'Cause you won't ever have enough
There's always someone with more than you
You need to pay her attention
Give her what she needs
Do the simple things
Before you lose your girl to me

[Break]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeeah
Yeeeah, yeah
Play on, playa
Yeah, your girl coming with me shorty, haha
I'm telling you, man
Cause you know...

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Verse 3]
You better look out
I hear you talking, I hear you talking, ha
But what are you saying?
Oh hoo oh hooo
Don't be a fool, you got a good thing
Man, are you blind, stupid or crazy?
You got a good thing, uh
You got a good thing
If that's your lady, you better hold on
And give her what she want before she move on
Man, I tell you, cars, clothes, and fancy things don't mean a damn thing
If you ain't kicking it, baby

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life we forget
You hear her talking, but don't hear what she said
Why do you make something so easy so complicated?
Searching for what's right in front of your face
But you can't see it

[Outro]
Don't let this be the thing you'll always regret, no
It's right there, it's right there...
