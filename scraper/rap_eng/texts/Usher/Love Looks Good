[Verse 1]
Summer goes, Winter slow
Autumn leaves but you're still around (yeah, yeah)
And my feelings grow because you know how to captivate a crowd
When you turn on that smile (yeah)

[Chorus]
The look of love, you wear it well
Baby, love looks good on you
I knew you got it all, I can tell
Because you always look brand new

[Verse 2]
The wind it blows and the snow is gone
But raindrops dance on my window, babe
(No oh) yeah, yeah, yeah
And whenever you put it on, you shine like a charm sugar
I hope your wardrobe doesn't change
(Oh no, keep it right there sugar)

[Chorus]
The look of love, you wear it well
Baby, love looks good on you
I know you got it all, I can tell
Because you always look brand new
Love looks good on you

[Bridge]
Oh girl I love your energy
You're doing something, love
A total new identity when you turn on that smile
Even before you make your move
Girl your presence alone, ooh, that will do
Love looks good on, you

[Chorus]
The look of love, you wear it well
Baby, love looks good on you
I know you got it all, I can tell
(Because you always look brand new)
