[Verse 1]
They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Leave it till it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill
Only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Let's go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now (numb)
(Numb)

[Bridge]
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
But you can't feel it, do you?

[Chorus]
(Numb)
Shake it off, then you go, I don't care anymore (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now (numb)
I can feel you now, I can feel you now

[Outro]
Can you feel it?
