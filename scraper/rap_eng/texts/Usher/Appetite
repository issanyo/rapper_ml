[Intro]
Yeah, man
True story
Real G's with me on this one

[Verse 1]
Wifey home, wedding band, I'm a lucky man
You'd think I'd be satisfied and truthfully, yes I am
But lately, only late at night, I find it hard to sleep
Stay struggling with the part of me that wants to run the streets
My Mac is in my backpack, I'm surfing on the sites
I'm chatting, this ain't cheating, just telling myself a lie
And it's almost like I'm caught up and living another life
Man, I'm hungry for something, I need to feed this appetite

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to be late, rush through security gates
With weather in Atlanta, all outgoing flights delayed
No rooms left in the Mandarin, I gotta figure out a play
Sparked up some conversation, she was going the same way
We started talking business, she handed me a card
We exchanged information, I rented me a car
While I'm driving, she calling, I'm thinking this is how it starts
Fine as hell, but I don't wanna break my baby's heart

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Verse 3]
They call me U-S, H-E-R, R-A, Y-M, O-N-D
And I just wanna do right by my lady
But lately, I been slipping up, fantasies 'bout dimes on the side, dark tint on my ride
I got a 10 in my ride, I can hide, I can't lie, lie
But ever since I put that band on my hand
More and more chicks trying to get at me than I know what to do
Just trying to handle my grown man B.I ,got a girl I don't want to lose, I don't want to lose
Break her heart, I do want to do, I don't want to be that fool, make that move
Bend them a bit, but never break the rules, bend a bit but never break the rules

[Chorus]
Tempted I must confess, but I better not make a mess
Better give my girl my best, put my BS under arrest
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies
Could've picked up the phone, could've ended up doing wrong
Man, I miss home, but I ate my dinner at home
'Cause I love my lady
Fellas, if you love your girl, fight that appetite for the ladies
Appetite for the ladies

[Outro]
She got the door locked and the lock don't fit your key
Yeah, you punching up her numbers in the ADT
You'll be wondering how the hell I let this happen to me
Better not feed, feed, feed that appetite
Now your baby's gone, you putting out an APB
And some other brother been tossing up your PYT
Get caught slipping you gone wish you would've listened to me
Brother, don't feed, feed, feed that appetite
