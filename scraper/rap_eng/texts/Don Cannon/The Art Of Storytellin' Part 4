[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
(Cannon)
So I'm watchin' her fine ass
Walk to my bedroom, and thought to myself
"That's the shape of things to come"
She said, "Why you in the club, you don't make it precipitate?
You know, make it rain when you can make it thunderstorm?"
I'm like, "Why?"
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There's a war going on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor
So I write like Edgar Allen to restore - got a cord
Umbilical attached to a place that can't afford
No landscaping, or window draping
This old lady told me
If I ain't got nothin' good, say nathing
That's why I don't talk much
I swear it don't cost much, to pay attention to me
I tell like it is, then I tell it how it could be
The hood be
Requesting my services
Oh don't get nervous it's
Step yo game up time
These ain't them same old rhymes
Designed to have you dancin' in some club
Niggas ride to me women be off in they tub
Ex-foliating with they poms-poms
Yelling, "Go 3000!"
I'm in my whatever bumpin' N.W.A
"A 100 miles and"
Runnin' Runnin' Runnin' Runnin'
Summon
Woman
Come in
Sit down, heard you need some plumbin'
Done in
I'm in
A swell mood
A rather swole mood
Until she told me that she told dude
That she'll be back, she's going to the store
I didn't know she had a boyfriend, so the door
I pointed her to
I said, "Call me when ya'll break up"
"I don't fuck nobody bitch
And never owned a Jacob," know what time it is
Nigga just
Tryin' to live like a Nigga supposed to live
If I still drank that malt liquor
I'd pour the beer
On the ground for niggas not around;
I started off starvin'
Now they got me out here Brett Favre'n
Trynna' see if I still got it... (got it...)
I guess it's like a bike think about it...

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
So I peep this bitch in V.I.P
I used to clip like Rob the barber
It seems she couldn't shape up
Cupcake her, I didn't bother
She's a follower a hell of a swallower
Not a leader
Got her 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string
I didn't need her
I didn't mean to treat her
Like she was the main feature
Presentation, heard ya's a traitor
To the situation, more like a hassle
Because she had no keys to the castle
The queen sits on the throne
While this ho ride down Old National
(ZOOM) gon' head' ho beat ya feet
DR-DR-Drop down and get yo eagle on freak
We ever-so-discreet with this meet
Got a whole lot to lose if paparazzi
Ever shot or shoot we
Meaning me and you
Us together in the lens
My ends would be gone
Just like some "Dro in the Wind"
Told da ho you gonna win
Sho' 'nuff we gon' pretend
To the land of make believe
Now come on and hit this Hen...
Taking shots to the neck
Now that's love in ya mou-outh
Now we're Aphilliates
So don't give me the Gangsta Grill
No Drama it makes no sense
I got a mean ass backhand
And a (Cannon) that don't miss
Bitch
