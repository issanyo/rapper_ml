[Intro]
You know my pockets loaded
You know my pockets swollen
All of my diamonds frozen
You know my pockets loaded
You know my pockets swollen
All of my diamonds frozen
You know my pockets loaded
You know my (8-8-8-8....)

[Pre-Chorus]
My diamonds, they frozen
Ooh, pockets loaded (yeah)
Diamond chain, they glowin'
Ooh, and they showin' (whoa)
Money, I'mma throw it
Ooh, watch me blow it (blow)
Cop shit when I'm bored, ooh
That you can't afford (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (whoa)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (yeah)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (whoa)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Chain white, like it's snowin'
Drive my car, like it's stolen
Wipe my nose, I'ma blow it
Watch cost 81 thousand like Terrell Owens
Counting up all these checks
I'mma flex, on my ex
Smoking gas, lost my breath
'Long as I'm loaded, I'ma flex
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
You live with your mother, aye, so I call you junior
Balmain pockets, loaded, loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded

[Pre-Chorus]
My diamonds, they frozen
Ooh, pockets loaded (yeah)
Diamond chain, they glowin'
Ooh, and they showin' (whoa)
Money, I'mma throw it
Ooh, watch me blow it (blow)
Cop shit when I'm bored, ooh
That you can't afford (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (woah)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (yeah)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (woah)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (loaded)

[Verse 2]
Not a Land, Range my Rover
I don't gotta drive, pull up with a chauffeur
Bitch, I get so fly, when I shop at Dover
They all in disguise, just know that I'm loaded
Pocket got the gas, just know that I'm loaded
Pocket got the gas, just know that I'm loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded (woah)
Went to the bank today, they said "You're, Loaded"
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
Saw you, flexin', but you don't, own it
I just went platinum
Count my, bonus

[Pre-Chorus]
My diamonds, they frozen
Ooh, pockets loaded (aye)
Diamond chain, they glowin' (what)
Ooh, and they showin' (huh)
Money, I'mma throw it
Ooh, watch me blow it (blow)
Cop shit when I'm bored, ooh
That you can't afford (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded (whoa), loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (yeah)
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded (aye)

[Outro]
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
Loaded, loaded, loaded, loaded
