[Verse 1: 2 Soldier]
Cause of conflict, violence and war make militia
Governing like tykes they clowed and slow gifted
Hand me two percent of the world bet I'll profit
Mother earths cause of death are starving stomach issues
Time to focus on forbes like lifes focused on us
Opportunity plus numbers game theory strategy
Papers good could be great trouble tragedy
Real money catch my breath before any companies
Audio stay bangin' verify my rankin'
Grid iron bird gang super bowl expanding
Build a complex for Pat Tillman we thankin'
Lombardi for the shelf's is all that we asking
Posting up numbers people think is hackin'
About to go in like my name never lackin'
White indica hit me up for some samplin'
Listen to this prefrence while keep it crafty
Serena Ali till this day is my fantasy
Natural state of mind when ones speak so rapidly
Recognizing all migos who record from the valley
Murder on a freestyle toss them in an alley
Yeah
Toss them in an alley
Murder on a freestyle toss em in an alley
Senators just smile but this is reality
Labeling hidalgo county as third world country
Plus excising the use of brutality
Everyone on board should report for amnesty
All elected ones voting bankruptcy
With figures to lie, evidence is known still won't comply
Doesn't matter
Not any are my influence to my name
But Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Robert Johnson, Billy Haley
Peggy Lee, Billie Holiday, Fat Domino, Everly Brothers are however my ideals
Doesn't change the fact that mula still important
Classified as evil similar to a serpent
Faith on your thought or whatever you worship
Confused about your life just dont turn in to a subject
Portray many gods killing thoughts make conflicts
Grinding for the spot because my thoughts sound certain
Two soldier off the block racking money hitting mind ever so perfect

[Hook: August Alsina]
Be on my grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah

[Verse 2: 2 Soldier]
This is the grievances project bad; the archives with no weaknesses
Place on the roster recognized by rap genius
Creatures of space live virtuous or vicious
View thru our minds brains get suspicious
Feelin' like the album label it ambition
2 Soldiers introduction I'm the opposition
Pat Tillman Strong made his own decision
Science in my blood build by its religion

[Hook: August Alsina]
Grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
