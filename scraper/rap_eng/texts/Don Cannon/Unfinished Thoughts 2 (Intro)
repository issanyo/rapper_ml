[Intro]
Ladies and Gentleman
It is with my greatest honor to introduce
Nah-Nah thats not the right words
It is with my greatest honor
To welcome you
To Unfinished Thoughts 2 By Will C
Let me let em in
Cheeaaa

[Verse 1]
They spit trash like God dammit they spit trash
They sound like human centipede's, man they kiss ass
They lack the similes, wasting all of the energy
Couldn't cut this shit in half with perfect symmetry
Everything they make is fabricated
The underground sound on the radio has never made it
Making me sick like why even become famous?
I'm trying to become the shit without ever acting like the anus
My biggest fear is becoming one of them
You see I'm gifted with these lyrics but what you don't understand
Is bullshit music increases just like the creases in my sneakers
They puzzled by me but they will never find the pieces
They can't figure me out yeah I'mma unfinished idea
Rappers becoming children im their personal nightmare
But bow down to your Majesty
Envy who I am welcome to bars Academy

[Hook]
Too many cluttered ideas in my mind
I rhyme when I find the time to climb up
Homie now what's up
The truth I barely caught
I'll explore it all with my unfinished thoughts yeah
So tell me what it do
I was playing with part one now wrecking all upon part two
And it's all love but of course
Let's smile while we floss
This is-this is unfinished thoughts

[Break A]
I can't believe unfinished thoughts one ended with super bass
Cheaaaaaaa
Well who knows
Maybe they'll be ummm
Unfinished thoughts two

[Verse 2]
Raised up as a young'n that was way too difficult
The type to spaz quick moods flipped like reciprocals
Little Spanish kid no idea what life is
But what I did was mold verbal words into an image with no visual
No kind of direction the paper and the pad was my weapon
Always looking for the answer when we never knew the question
If it's so simple
Then tell me what it is though
There's more to life than sex, drugs and Hollywood bimbos
Real recognize nothing going based off my assumptions
That the real don't stay at the table cause it's not up for discussion
And no I'm not your brother not your cousin
Claiming you were here when you know you really wasn't
Concluding that a new dude can't make it on youtube
Listening like who you?
Man it shouldn't really matter
Musician not a rapper
And if this shit gets boring I'mma flush it down the crapper (hey)
The definition of life it isn't stable
One snort of the cane will only leave you disabled
The real meaning of a punchline
Mike Tyson sniffing coke that's a punchline

[Hook]

[Break B]
It's not even funny
I get beats like this and I don't even know what the fuck to say and excuse my language
This whole mixtape is gonna have a shit load of curses
You should know this by now have you heard unfinished thoughts one
Oh you're not familiar with will you should go on datpiff
Uh-huh uh-huh
Keep your kids away
CHEAAAAAAAAAA
I need to stop doing that

[Verse 3]
I'm on the Internet in Africa so life is a safari
Thinking drinking while I'm freaking makes for one wild party
So the shots of Bacardi only helps me feeling naughty
While I'm looking for a shawty
Come early I might be tardy
Maybe this life is too much for me
No kids but I got full custody
That means the microphone belongs to I
Swimming in Octopussy watching goldeneye
Too many punchlines for you dummies
There is all rumbling in my tummy
To eat these chicks up poohs mad that I ate all of his honeys
Thinking looking for my Princess and not a salary
Would have me traveling planets just like Mario galaxy
Mad at me cause I'm a quality pieces
What's the point of getting high everything else is beneath us
And they want to know why does will rap
I don't even know, let me finish the first track

[Hook]
