[Verse]
Fearing every opportunity that comes my way
Just gotta open up the gates and seize the day
Most times I settle for just holding back
But that won't get you anywhere, my family told me that
I'm pretty thankful that they showed so much support
To a little, goofy nerd who was never good at sports
Who all day stayed inside and played with toys
Connected with the girls better than the boys
And I just wanted all the kids to like me
Rocked knock off kicks, never owned some Nikes
Tried soccer but that wasn't for me
I was asthmatic, spazmatic and found it boring
Ran around the field I was up for the chase
But I never touched the ball till it smashed my face
So, I had to find another activity
Maybe one that wasn't just a test of masculinity
One that I could showcase my creative abilities
One that would make me happy and fill my needs
All around the house I would sing and dance
My parents said how about performing? Give it a chance
Started acting in the school plays
Those were the highlights of my school days
Found an area where I excelled and fit in
Thought, huh so it's okay to be different
Then I started listening to rap
Now I'm like yo how awesome is that
I write my own songs and I make my own beats
Build my own volcano and I spit my own heat
Though people put me down cause I'm white and I ain't from the streets
I go yeah I know, that's not who I'm trying to be
I've never drank alcohol and never smoked weed
In a way, I'm the same as when I was in grade three
K, maybe not, I have grown a lot
Taken my maturity and up it shot
Could make music like a robot
But I rap my ass off and it don't stop
I rap my ass off and it don't stop
Bop, and I've gone pop
Never gon' flop
