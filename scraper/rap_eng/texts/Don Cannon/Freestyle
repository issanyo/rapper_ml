Roll 24s, mills In my disposals
Still blow dro and chill with a ho or two
Still tote steal cause jackers'll be all over you
Whether you worth a hundred mill or a O or two
Hatin' start small but jealousy's what it grow into
Hate to see me ballin' and bury me's what you wanna do
I'll front you 50 I owe you, I don't know you
Nigga and you better duck from whatever I'm gon' throw you
Nigga, keep plottin', I'm forced to .44 you
I'm so close to layin' you down and your folks too
Anti-social, toast you from a close view
Leave you layin' and wonderin' who you spoke to
I'll probably never go pop or bi-coastal
Cause in this game G's gotta die to get what they 'posed to
He don't matter, my flow the truth and I'm so cool
I'm the king of the south, nigga I told you
