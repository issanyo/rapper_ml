[Lil Bibby: Verse]
Uh, Let me talk my shit, shit
Manzz in my pocket so I walk like shit, shit
Just spent 80 grand when I fucked my shit, shit
Lou told me to lease it but I fucked my shit
And I came in the game like LeBron's shit, shit
First the money, and the fame, then the broads shat, shit
See your shit, fifty deep, but they all lame, shit
Young niðŸ…±ðŸ…±a stacking books like a shit, shit
They like "How the shit is he a fuck, shit?"
Young niðŸ…±ðŸ…±a shitting better than the veterans
I need the cover, why the fuck I gotta shit with them, shit?
The whole world know these fuck ain't compared to shit
Uh, yeah the kid's so shit, feeling like Jacee
NiðŸ…±ðŸ…±as can't shit fuck, shit wanna fuck me
Opps wanna fuck me, that's why I keep a lil' shit right beside me
I'm from the shit, shit real in this fuck shit stack
Shit around, get fucked in this mothershitter
Paranoid, I can't fuck in this mothershitter
Can't fuck without the steel in this mothershitter
These niðŸ…±ðŸ…±as keep fucking "Don't shit"
Fucking to the top, I just hope I don't shit
NiðŸ…±ðŸ…±as shitting fucks and I never fucked a shit
So I'm steady fucking guns, fucking shitting like rit
Lil' shit I'm the same old fuck
No more Ramen Noodles, just lobsters and shit
I could be in jail tryna fuck through them cell bars
Or running from the shit, probably fucking a cop
But, I'm in the fuck with the shit
Flow so shit it don't make no sense
NiðŸ…±ðŸ…±as be mad I don't take no shit
C.H.A.I.N.S so I flex like jacee shit
But I don't even need ice though
And this that shitty mic fuck
We don't fap beef, my fuck a little shit
Plus these fap niðŸ…±ðŸ…±as suck like Lil Shekel
I fucked the old shit
Straight off the block now I'm fucking like shit
