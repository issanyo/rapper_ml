Why you hatin'?

Boy, you fakin'!
Boy, you fakin'!
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yeah, uh
Aye, tell me, aye, why you hatin'
That be Maaly Raw!

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

[Verse 1]
Nowadays I get like 80k a show
Now at fifty shows straight from my tour
Run it up, run it up
Fuck your bitch, made her play double-dutch
Hit from the back, fuck her stomach up
Cheerios, lick on my honey nuts
Nowadays I get like 80k a show
Now at fifty shows straight from my tour
Run it up, run it up
Fuck your bitch, made her play double-dutch
Hit from the back, fuck her stomach up
Cheerios, lick on my honey nuts

[Bridge]
Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro, that's 'cause she a hoe
Lil Uzi, I hope you prepared for the ride
Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro, that's 'cause she a hoe
Diamonds all on my fingers, diamonds all on her toes
Fucking R&B singers, I got R&B hoes

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

[Verse 2]
Feel like Triple-Six Mafia, all I see is demons
That bitch ain't on a boat, all she see is seamen
Four-hundred dollars for a brand-new Gucci beanie
Whip it up like pasta, eat it up like a linguini
Oops, I flexed I’m sorry
I ain’t even mean it
Oops, I flexed I’m sorry
I ain’t even mean it
See it then I get it
If I want it, already have it
Diamonds on my Rollie, AP flooded like a Patek

[Bridge]
I knew that I
I wouldn't make up
Time is racin'
I have patience
I wear the, Cartier, these ain't ray-bans
Why you fakin'
Why you hatin'

[Chorus]
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Chop it, up, off the plate, how long do it take?
Bake a cake, smoke a face, half-baked, want the face
Do no date, diamond water, like an ocean, like a lake

[Outro]
Tell me
Why you hatin'
Fuck yo girl on cam, GoPro that's 'cause she a hoe
Diamonds all on my fingers, diamonds all on her toes
Fucking R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers, I got R&B singers
I got R&B singers
I got R&B hoes
