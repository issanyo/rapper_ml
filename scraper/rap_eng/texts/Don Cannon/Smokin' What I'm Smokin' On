[Hook: MOD SUN]
Trust me when I say this you ain’t smokin what I’m smokin on
But if you rollin with me then you better bring the dope along
I only take a hit if you holding on that super strong
You think you got a plug, I been the plug all a long

[Verse 1: Mod Sun]
Holy moly I got OZ’s right now
You should see me I be smokin’ like its going out of style
I walk down into my basement I call that the green mile
Beanie just gave me the call we bout to chop em' all down
Mod Sun OG, fully loaded grow it slowly
Members only, don’t ask to hit if you don’t know me
"shhh", Its that loud, you can hear it if you listen closely
I blow a cloud, + that shit lookin’ ghostly

[Hook: MOD SUN]
Trust me when I say this you ain’t smokin what I’m smokin on
But if you rollin with me then you gotta bring the dope along
I only take a hit if you holding on that super strong
You think you got a plug, I been the plug all a long

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Aye, I smoke OG
I’mma OG, smoke front police
You don’t know me, sip that syrup movin’ slowly
Told that bitch stop callin’, why that bitch stop callin’
Got your hoe she stalkin’, Louie V, I’m Hawkin’
Fly as a bird, i'm choppin a brick + im servin the first
Im choppin the curb, I got the gas just give me your word
Rich Forever fuck around got a deal
23 with a mill, sip that active out a seal
Smokin’ Cookie pop a pill
Charging 50 a verse, needed lean call the nurse
Whippin pots and the skrt, Whippin the pots and I skrt
Youngest nigga on the Forbes list
Record deal talkin’ Forbes shit
In the club make a mosh pit
I got the gas on the block bitch

[Hook: MOD SUN]
Trust me when I say this you ain’t smokin what I’m smokin on
But if you rollin with me then you gotta bring the dope along
I only take a hit if you holding on that super strong
You think you got a plug, I been the plug all a long

[Verse 3: Mod Sun]
I’m in my zone off that homegrown, won’t phone home
When I’m with my leaves just leave me alone lone
Please don’t complicate this + ask for a photo
I would smoke with you bro but your shit look so so, so I’m blowin solo
Yeah I might move to Amsterdam where I belong
I might cop a crib + grow some weed up on my front lawn
Pull up to the coffee shop I bet they banging’ this song
Still they ain’t smokin’ what we smokin’ on

[Hook: MOD SUN]
Trust me when I say this you ain’t smokin what I’m smokin on
But if you rollin with me then you gotta bring the dope along
I only take a hit if you holding on that super strong
You think you got a plug, I been the plug all a long

[Verse 3: D.R.A.M.]
I know this Rockstar and his name is Jonny
He got a mansion in the hills out LA Cali
He got a ashy Bentley for every other Friday
His other whip is this lil' Beamer he whip like a Hyundai
He got all of that from weed and no other drug
Really he the plug, and he should be like Blood
He talks some Quarter P’s like a Quarterback
Like Joe Namath, Montana, Cam Newton Damn
I don’t fuck with Dabs, I just roll up OG
Just cause I gave you dap does not mean you know me
I had to smoke I had to smoke with Dza
On the hundred 17th street with all his niggas
I used to only could afford the grade thats in the middle
Now I only smoke the killer yeah the glue Gorilla
You can smell the pack on me this ain’t fake homie
You can still smell the pack even when it ain’t on me

[Hook: MOD SUN]
Trust me when I say this you ain’t smokin what I’m smokin on
But if you rollin with me then you gotta bring the dope along
I only take a hit if you holding on that super strong
You think you got a plug, I been the plug all a long

[Outro]
Trust me, Trust me when I say this
Trust me, Trust me when I say this
You ain’t smokin’ what I’m smokin on
