[Intro]
G.O.A.T. (yah)
That's true! Yah!
Uzi... Uzi... not again
Uzi, wake your ass up

[Chorus]
And I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I ain't gon' lie

[Pre-Verse]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just wanna let you know
I really really wanna let you know
That I really don't give a fuck what nobody say about me
'Cause you know I'm the one
Yes, I'm the one that really started all this
And you know I changed a lot of you niggas
In a matter of months, I raised a lot of you niggas

[Verse 1]
They know I'm the one so it's no way they can stop it
Tried to run off with the swag, I put 'em in pocket
Told my main girl to stop it
She saw me up in a picture, I thought they cropped it (oh my god)
Damn, she think I popped it (oh my god)
I will not give these bitches this dick, let them top it
Woah, we're endin' that topic
In the industry with Dickies all on my Pac shit

[Chorus]
And I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie (yeah, whatchu got?)
I ain't gon' lie

[Bridge]
Yeah, the famous life, it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side
Put it to the side, ayy
Yeah, the famous life, it'll eat you up alive
It's a game and I put my feelings to the side

[Verse 2]
Time's up, I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds, they blinding
I can't fuck her, she a minor
Time's up, I check my watch every hour
All of my diamonds, they blinding
I can't fuck her, she a minor
Look for your bitch, you can't find her
I was the one right behind her
Talking that shit you get tied up
Don't got enough? Get your grind up
The reason I got all these bitches and got all these diamonds
I can't make my mind up
Mind up, she gave me head, gave that mind up

[Chorus]
And I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie
I got money and the power, I ain't gon' lie

[Outro]
