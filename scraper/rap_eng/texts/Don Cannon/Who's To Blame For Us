I bleeded out my heart with you, babe
I don't think I wasted my time
And from the start we've been crazy
But I think I started taking my time

I bleeded out my heart with you, babe
I don't think I wasted my time
And from the start we've been crazy
But I think I started taking my time

And it's good that you're good
But me, I think I'm losing
I don't feel understood
So where the fuck have you been?

Ricky, I start to feel like I'm washed up
Pissed off at the life, like they lost us
Drift off with my type, I am nauseous
Long hair, long legs, like my lost love

[Chorus x2]
Who's to blame for us
That our love is so dangerous
And I know
And I know
If I didn't I'd be smoking on angel dust

Yeah, in this cold, cold world
Ain't nothing that we find but the girl
Been in love since the day you came across me
And I been high like a motherfucker, awfully
Dig deep, get them off me
Tell them that I'm never gonna come around here again
And if they hear me then they hearing now
And if they hear me then they hearing now

Nostra
Bad bitches, we be pulling them
Poser, Backwoods you ain't pullin' them
I am and I'm feelin like I'm supposed to be
Lamosa pride tatted on my sleeve

[Chorus x2]
Who's to blame for us
That our love is so dangerous
And I know
And I know
If I didn't I'd be smoking on angel dust

Baby, look
This is when they take the love
Fuck 'em, I don't need they love
Fuck 'em, I don't need they love

Baby, look
This is when they take the love
Fuck 'em, we don't need they love
Fuck 'em, we don't need they love

[Chorus x2]
Who's to blame for us
That our love is so dangerous
And I know
And I know
If I didn't I'd be smoking on angel dust
