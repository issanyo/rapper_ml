Intro
Yeah, you know the boy make you feel alright
You, me, my place come through let's chill
Skittles and the redbull, I don't need no pills
When I get that feeling, uh, I can tell it darling
(That was me on the adlibs too, in case you didn't know)
Get up, get up, get up, need sum luvin'
I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up

Verse 1
You know when I'm in the mood
I'm down to do whatever just to get the women nude
Make them feel it in they shoes
I hit it till they drool, when I drill em with the tool
Man you couldn't get wetter, if you're swimming in the pool
And I ain't even gotta lick em no, when I'm getting psychical
Spit a little game, reel em in like a fishing pole
When I'm done, have them walking funny like she pidgeon toe
Young tie, bridges high, hit it with a different stroke
(How you like it?) From the back like a hammer to a nail
I know the boy Short hard to handle like a tail
Bobbing way your eyes closed, then you got your legs shakin
Asking me to grind slow for you have the bed breaking
Neighbors beating down the door like the feds thinking
That somebody being murdered all the noises that you makin
And you got a man probably, you ain't gotta lie to me
To tell the truth, I'm just tryina hit it like the lottery

[Hook]
When I get that feeling, uh, I can tell you darling
Come take control, on my body and mind
Just grab a hold, need sum lovin'
I need sum lovin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up

Verse 2
Look, now pardon me, I don't mean to bother you
But every time I see you, girl my thoughts are getting naughtier
(What you talking bout)
Now pulling out the cameras and recording you (ok)
But first you gotta get down on your knees like a gardener
The things you do, make me wanna thank the man that fathered you
I bet he never knew how much a freak his daughter was
So go on climb upon it like a ladder
Then ride it like a bike until you feel it in your bladder
And we can take it slow or I can do it faster
Bet I have you singing notes that will make the window shatter
I'll have you talking dirty cause I'm the hall of chatter
We can do it on the bed, or the floor, it don't matter
We can take it to the couch or we can head to the shower
Just thought it out I got you screaming louder
And by the way you sweating I can tell it's getting hotter
Now turn around and watch me beat it up like a pinata cause

[Hook]
When I get that feeling, uh, I can tell you darling
Come take control, on my body and mind
Just grab a hold, need sum lovin'
I need sum lovin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up

(And I don't play no games, I'mma make you say my name)
(Yeah I don't play no games, have em like boy do your thing)

Verse 3
Now baby girl you know what I like
Let's get straight to it I ain't got all night
They call me Short Dawg but baby I don't bite
Unless of course you want me to, I sure will
Cause anything you ask I can try to do
Have you sweating up the sheets like you got a flu
Going wild like the animals inside the zoo
Make you bend over like you gotta tie your shoe
And all it takes is a shot or 2
And I'm coming out the prada boots
And she coming out the vickies
Hand full of hair with a neck full of hickies
Legs in the hair, horse stomping, chest licking
While I beat it like a snare, heart pumping, sweat dripping
I know you feel it, and still I don't stop
Even if you getting tired, you just get on top cause

[Hook]
When I get that feeling, uh, I can tell you darling
Come take control, on my body and mind
Just grab a hold, need sum lovin'
I need sum lovin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up I need sum luvin'
Get up, get up, get up, I need sum luvin'
Wake up, wake up
