[Mixtape Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout to Casey Veggies! Shout to 100s!
Ay, what? Cannon's what up!
Black and white!
(Trendsetter)

[Intro: Jesse Rutherford]
You need to get off my mind

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
I'm never satisfied
It's never good enough
I always seem to find the right
Formula for puttin' up

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I tried to love you, baby
In every way, in every way
I tried to satisfy you, honey
But you wouldn't stay, I knew you wouldn't stay

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
I'm like a clothing rack
Ya hang it out on me
And if I really wanna find someone else
I'll find some company, eh-yeah
I'm in a hurry, I don't wanna worry 'bout a little hiccup
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see that I am sick of... it all?

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I tried to love you, baby
In every way, in every way
I tried to satisfy you, honey
But you wouldn't stay, I knew you wouldn't stay
I tried to love you, baby
In every way, in every way
I tried to satisfy you, honey
But you wouldn't stay, I knew you wouldn't stay

[Interlude: Jesse Rutherford]
I knew it was wrong but I thought about you still

[Verse 2: Raury]
Girl, I do not know where you're running to
I'm your finish line, I'm the one for you
If you do me wrong, if I'm cruel to you
You're a fool for me, I'm a fool for you
Shawty been talkin' about her new options
But options do not mean that they're competition
The master key perfectly fits your ignition
Forever under the greatest possession
You are not foreign at all to this sentence
Hopefully this is the first time you did this shit
Rooms full of naked and caucasian women

[Outro: Raury]
Rooms full of naked and caucasian women
