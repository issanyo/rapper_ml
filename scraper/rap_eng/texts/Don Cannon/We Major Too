[Chorus: Maestro J & ODCS]
You mothafuckas better do your job and roll up
And watch how I roll up, ceilings can not hold us
Damn your homie blown up!
And you can tell from the bottom floor that we major
We get the party bumpin' like acne faces
Got the girlies all on their bad behavior
Anywhere we at you can tell that we major
That we major...That we major

[Verse 1: ODCS]
Oh! What a life it is!
I can shock a crowd like lightning quick
Cloud the doubters out while I write this shit
'Till I grow old and focus on my wife and kids
I know you like this shit
And I know you're gonna love it when I light this spliff
So let's get high real quick
And then I'll saddle up so you can ride this dick

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Maestro J]
Niggas said that I done fell of the map
But like acrobats a nigga flipped right back on the track
Put a statement in the stone so what the fuck is a plaque?
I feel ahead of all these rappers like I'm leading the pack
Even though I'm not known, but I'm in another zone
Opponents are nothing but opposition
Like opposite where I'm sitting
Cop a squat for the shitting
Smoking sky 'till I'm lifted
X-Rated boy, no Xzibit
Now I got they attention
No A.D.D. could keep my mind off these bars
'Cause I'm trying to use these bars so I can party with stars
Maybe use my gold bars to buy myself a Ferrari
I keep playing this life like it was old school Atari
Waxed her on and got her off like I was Mr. Miyagi
Kicking like Karate Kid like it's instilled in my heartbeat
But my hair's still as long as Jaden's
So I'll shock the world, electrified like I'm Raiden

[Chorus]

[Outro: Maestro J]
Maestro! ODCS
Once again
Got another
We'll be back next time
We had fun though!
Yeah yeah
And we out!
