[Intro: Lil Uzi Vert]
Funny, you can't turn me down
I already know nobody don't got my back
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack, racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack, racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Ooh
Boy, you cappin'
Boy, you cappin'
Ooh, you ain't put nothing on the map
Choppa on my lap
Ooh, she like when I pop them tags
Yeah, don't trip 'bout my tag, yeah
Get my swag from my dad, yeah
Hunnid bands in my bag
30 rounds in my mag
Fuck niggas bit my swag, ayy
I was just tryna walk past, yeah
Put your lil bitch on a jet
Then sucked my dick in your lap, yeah
Smile in the whip, drive fast
Goin' way faster than the Dash
Wanna race, boy, get dragged
Talking too slick, get clapped
Fucking your bitch, no fag
So fuck nigga better relax
'cause everything I say facts
Had to skate on a bitch like Vans
Been wearing these shits since The Pack
Ridin' 'round all black Mac
Know I gotta watch my back

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack, racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack, racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Kick my one-two, yeah, ooh
Fuck around, hunt you
Kick shit, Kung Fu
All my foreigns new
Pour my Mountain Dew
Diamonds from Cancun
Twenty bitches at the Fontainebleau (dramatic)
Psychic clowns, too
Your diamonds got clouds, too
Money tall need a ladder, too
Can't wait to embarrass you
I was thuggin' like a bastard too
I fuck like midnight blues
Three-hunnid for the big Bentley Coupe (Uh, yeah)
Wrist on froze like "Ouch"
Got a car in the house like a couch
Been rich, your bitch can vouch, yeah
Now bring your scout, yeah
I put my dick in her mouth, yeah
We was on your couch, yeah
I put my nut on her comb, now you got a nut in your hair
Chanel on her manicure
My flow means eleven
I got me a wife but, I still live like a bachelor
I told her we married
But I'm never 'gone marry her
I married the money and karats
I'm not tryna embarrass ya

[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks
Bag, bag, bag, bag
Stack racks, racks, racks
Black Mac, stay strapped
Ooh, big racks
Ooh, large stacks
