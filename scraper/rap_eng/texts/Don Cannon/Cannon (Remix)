[Chorus]
Shit
Yo, what's the process?
You're talking nonsense
So I'ma do this remix (Cannon, Cannon)
For you cheapskates, this is how I get my free kicks
This cracker's gonna peel his money 'cause that (yo, y-y-yo)
Yo, what's the process?
You're talking nonsense
So I'ma do this remix (Cannon, Cannon)
For you cheapskates, this is how I get my free kicks
This cracker's gonna peel his money 'cause that cheese sticks

[Verse 1]
This ain't no average emcee
I'm 10 steps ahead of a rapper that test me
My choes be cold as Gretzky, wetter than a jetski
Flyer than the jets be, iller than the Jets' D
Word to Revis, I'm shutting down receivers
Taking all these critics, turn 'em into believers
I'ma kill it
Gon' meet the reaper
Gon' kick the beat, got my sneakers on the speaker
One hand for my cup
One hand, one hand to hold my damn pants up
I'm 'bout it
Real rappers talk shit, you hoes shout it
I'm not the man 'round here? I doubt it
Realest in the building, boy get out
You invite me to your city and I turn that shit out
They be hanging on every syllable that I spit out
I'm the delivery man and I'm taking it to the hit house bid-ditch
The way I kill it is redid-ick
And I'ma do this shit 'til I'm ridiculously rid-ditch, get it?
I'm on another level than you
Move the crowd and the song to the next venue (yeah)
The next menu, my team gon' eat you
Stand in the way, my team's gon' defeat
Got your chick doin' shit your clique won't believe
Your bitch open the box, then my team's gon' be dropping

[Verse 2]
They sayin', "Boy stop it and let me get low"
I'm sayin', "Girl drop it", I'm getting dip-so
I love the way you lick your lips and them hips go
You want me in them pants? Give me the zip code
Uh-uh, uh-uh, tell me what it's hittin' for
I'm already faded, but you know I'm getting more
Uh-uh, uh-uh, tell me what it's hittin' for
I got the hot hand, that's what the mitten's for
Yeah, you need it? I got it
I keep an ill-y flow, you do not know shit about it
The realest? Tell me I am not it
My whole team scheme chasing Hennessey with Hpnotiq, uh
Put me on, I just wanna be the greatest
Specktators, every song on the playlist
All the ladies that played us are haters
When we're everything they wanted, baby: young, rich, famous

[Outro]
Uh, yeah
Cannon, cannon, cannon, cannon
Haha, uh
Act like you know
You've just been hit in the head with a Specktators exclusive
Can you believe it?
