[Hook: Lil Da$h]
Lil Dash, Got a litle XIV feature on this one
Forevayung
Bape on the left like camo
Run in your crib with a strap like Rambo
Ridin with the goons in the Lambo
Stabbed me in the back like arrow

[Verse: Lil Da$h]
You spittin out this beaf like dissin
I pull up on the block and we kissin
You pull up on me yea I'm swingin
Just like class, your all dismissing!

Dismissal, dismissal. dismissal
Dismissal. dismissal. dismissal
Dismissal, dismissal

I cook up the diss like lays
360 no scope in yo crib like faze
In whippin my wrist like blaze
23 on my back yea I'm shootin like j's


You'll never know whats my backpack
But you will know that I am countin stack
Watching you crib like I max
Skkrt skrrt off like racetracks
In you crib sniper gang like Kodak
Collin on the beat like the beat is an ice pack, Lil Dash

[Verse: Lil XIV]
XIV is on the track
All these rappers are wack
Talk down and get smacked
Ouu, yeah you know it
XIV And Lil Dash, boy yous trash you a waste of my time
7:00, looks like its yo bedtime
Yeah, I'm in my prime
Spittin all these rhymes just like issa crime
Bouta eat her up like its mealtime
Sittin up in bape, uh
Get captured, can't escape, yous stuck like scotch tape
Call me Superman without a cape
Yeah I just stole yo babe
Yo say my Mueller a Rolex?
I'ma hit you with my index
Go drink some Windex
Then you can be dismissed
Cause yo life is a whole mess
Makin all these new checks
Your tapes are train wrecks
Lil boy yous are dismissed
