[Interlude: Jesse Rutherford & Devon Baldwin]
(Rain pours)
Don't count on your umbrella, that would be insane
Never meant to hurt ya, no, let me be your rain coat
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
Don't count on your umbrella, that would be insane
Never meant to hurt ya, no, let me be your rain coat
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain (Oh, oh)
Don't count on your umbrella, that would be insane
Never meant to hurt ya, no, let me be your rain coat
Rain, rain, rain, rain
