Ima take it take it take it take it take it take it all now
I keep moving up and y’all are getting left out

Oh my god I’m brilliant
Superman thru the ceiling
Acc wheels stay spinning
Poker face stay winning

Lil jack pot goofy ass white dude

Hurry up you moving slow
Rock star you already know
Next year we about to blow

Ima take it take it take it take it take it take it all now
I keep moving up and y’all are getting left out

Leave that leave that bullshit in the rear
Lean back lean back til the coast clear

A lot of people on my hit list
Got good aim I don’t miss
All the girls I used to fuck with

They love to deny like you’re always invited
Fuck off

Get the fuck out of my way

You were on the ground looking for change yeah
Next year ain’t no telling what I might do
I hit the jackpot on everyone of my moves
One of my moves

Ima take it take it take it take it take it take it all now
I keep moving up and y’all are getting left out
Wait til you see me next year
Its gonna be my best year
Leave that leave that bullshit in the rear
Lean back lean back til the coast clear
Yeah you know whats coming next
