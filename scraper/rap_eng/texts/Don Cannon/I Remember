[Verse 1: Curren$y]
My Cadillac got a chandelier
We keep it pumped full of gas in here
I just might take over rap this year
Kill all them niggas who dressin weird
Pack up that mess and get outta here
Smokers and focused on switchin' gears
Show you how that 911 steer
She wanted me to know how it feel
She expressin' herself while I grip the wheel
Girl, girl wait... Wait, wait you tryna get us killed
Get you back to the crib
You gon' the one be the main bitch
But I don't wanna do no more main bitches
Pull up I still do my thing wit' ya
Momma hyper like a 'caine sniffer
I'm might have a Uber come and get her
Bring her back to your house nigga
Real G shit, Never play out nigga
One of the illest niggas that's in the South, nigga
Turkey bags are the best
All grown out west
Come around, be my guest
We can have a hustle contest

[Chorus: Curren$y]
'Cause I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I wasn't always livin' like this homie
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
We wasn't always livin' like this'

[Verse 2: Cornerboy P]
I was sellin' reggie on the street for $10
Runnin' from truancy, hop the fence
Now I got two Rollies, I'ma ice 'em both
Drove her friend and she bad, tryna hit 'em both
Them dumb hoes tellin' me I do the most
Used to call me dirty, I ain't had it though
Now I got diamonds and designer clothes
Trappin' out the back with the screen do'
Hoppin' out the jeep with no doors on it
Don't show up to my house with all them clothes on
I'm talkin' to the money, nigga, hold on
I ain't know none of that shit you own
I can pimp a ho from my cell phone
I just roll up bread like a calzone
Rifle hit ya ass from a mile long
I just gave my last bitch the dial tone

[Chorus: Curren$y]
'Cause I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I wasn't always livin' like this homie
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
We wasn't always livin' like this'

[Verse 3: T.Y.]
Racin' Chevys on the interstate
Motor sound like an earthquake
Street money, yeah that's all I make
On that fly shit every day
I been waitin' up on my feature
Diamonds shinin' of the meter
Lil niggas out here tweakin'
I ain't slippin', yeah I keep it
Designer gas what I'm breathin'
I just left out of the Nolia
Shot to the A, me and my K
Bitch, I be rollin' with soldiers
Heavy metal strapped, top waist
A hunnid racks in the sofa
The flo', the wall, and in the ceiling
Round my neck I got trophies
Hunnid rounds if you try to take it


[Chorus: Curren$y]
'Cause I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I wasn't always livin' like this homie
I remember when I didn't have this shit
I remember when I didn't have this shit
We wasn't always livin' like this'
