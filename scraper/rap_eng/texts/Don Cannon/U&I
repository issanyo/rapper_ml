[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
I want you to know
I need you to be someone for me in my life, yeah
And I can't let you go, but you cheated on me
And now everybody thinks that you're the bad guy, yeah
Well, guess what, I think that you are, baby
I think you need some discipline, baby
And I think about you kissing him, baby
Fuck that guy, happy I don't know his name
I'll go ahead and let him play
And I can't try to control your brain

[Bridge: Jesse Rutherford]
All I really wanna do is think about you and I
All I really wanna do is think about you and I
But all you ever do is think about suicide
All I ever wanna do is think about who died

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
Be honest with me, when you're asleep
What do you see behind those eyes?
'Cause I brought something
But when you're away, well, nothing ever seems to come out right
But it's hard to remember dreams, baby
And I know you won't tell everything, baby
But you say I'm on your memory, baby, yeah
And that's fine, fuck, I think I know his name now
I hope that I don't go insane now
If so, I'll have to blow his brains out

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?
It don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
Don't matter what I'm doing, I keep thinkin' 'bout you and I
What the fuck am I supposed to do about you and I?
What the fuck are we supposed to do about you and I?

[Voicemail: Anabel Englund]
Right, I still love you
Even though youâ€™re a fucking cunt douche-bag
And I'm sure you feel the same about me
But, whatever, that's it
