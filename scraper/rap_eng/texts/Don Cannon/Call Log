Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it!

Got a model girl in my inbox
And her stylish friend in my recent calls
Ima hit one for a good time
Ima text the other for some time off
I'm touring really
I'm back and forth really
I was on stage Fader Fort really
Bank account got four 0s
Ego all on four mili
I'm so wit it (woo)
Told you if you had it like us
Tol you you can get them hoes automatic like us
All lies
Don't trust
All drinks
On us
All drinks
Like what
All drinks
On me
Then pour some up
Nigga let's get it
Cuz that's all I've been on
That's why I made this song
And all my girls keep asking me
Why you always gone well
I'm on a god mission
I need all my dawgs to get it
I'm broken to God evicted
But I'm on my way to the larger digits
Fast lane for the chain nigga beep beep
Whole bird on my name nigga tweet tweet
Missy Elliot dime rain dance I'm the nigga like these streets
And my phone been doing numbers like an auction
Phone been making plays just like a quarter back option talking
I've been on the road like a street sign
Lord put me on hold like three times
Kinda stressed so I need some me time
No really I just need some weed time
Forget these bitches I go senile
And all my exes in denial
Want my money long as the Nile
And a model on penial
And my dawgs free out of the pound
My money's all I be round
They mad I'm all they see now
Bitch I'm ballin like a rebound
Young Patrick Ewing
Put the four in the syrup
Tell lil mamma stir it
Then she rode me like a stirrup
It's liquor in my liver
And then I heard a ringin
Post a message before I even got to read it
Model girl in my inbox and her stylish friend in my recent calls
Ima hit one for a good time
Ima txt the other for some time off
Im drunk really
Back and forth really
I was on stage fader fort really
Bank account got 4 0s ego all on 4 mili I'm so wit
Told you if you had it like us
Told you you can get them hoes automatic like us
All eyes on us
All drinks on us
All drinks like what
All drinks on me
Nigga pour some up
Nigga let's get it
