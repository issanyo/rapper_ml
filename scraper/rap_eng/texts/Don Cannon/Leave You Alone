[Intro: Omarion]
Perfect love flew away days ago
Perfect lies, they can fly, they’re gone...

[Hook:]
I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah
Special spark
Went away, now it’s gone
I guess I gotta leave you alone, don't wanna leave you alone, yeah
Perfect hearts, they should shine when they glow
Everyone needs some time alone

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Tell me why didn’t I see it first
See the text on my phone in the dark
Tryna swallow my pride babe
Stole a little piece from my trust

[Hook:]

Don’t let this go
Or was it all for nothing...?

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Getting drunk in this room, in my zone
I should pick up this phone and call you here
See the tears, hit the floor, feel them flow
Selfish ways have me laying here alone
I can’t stop thinking about, I can’t stop thinking about you
Selfish ways have me laying here alone

[Hook: 2x]

Don’t let this go
Or was it all for nothing...?
