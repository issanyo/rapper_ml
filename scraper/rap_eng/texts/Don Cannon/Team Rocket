[Hook]
Like when it come to hundreds that's money my way
Remember she ain't want me now she all in my face
Like uh girl you too late, you ain't got no taste
Driving to the bank, I can't close my safe
Brittany be my bae
Money anyway
Um I couldn't wait

[Verse 1]
Getting these hundreds I count it
What you want watch me just count it
All of my diamonds outstanding
Don't want to sit on the dick then just stand bitch
Nowadays I'm getting money
Paid a hundred fifty just for a sandwich
Walk around with the big guns so a lil nigga know you cannot jump me
Oh no hoe you can't have my cake
Stepping in Margiela you can't walk my way
Like get out my face
Diamonds on my teeth don't talk my way
What do you want with me?
What do you want with me?
Kicking her out see you later
Cancel her like Ricki Lake
I was just playing 2K
Losing my money 2K
But I got all of this cake
It do not matter to me

[Hook]
Like when it come to hundreds that's money my way
Remember she ain't want me now she all in my face
Like uh girl you too late, you ain't got no taste
Driving to the bank, I can't close my safe
Brittany be my bae
Money anyway
Um I couldn't wait

[Verse 2]
What is that all on your waist
Goyard that's all on my waist
Cartier all on my face
I got the dreads with the fade
Talking that shit get you fade
Walking around with the bank
Walking around with the bank
Ya walking around with the bank
Ya I'm alright
Nowadays I feel like I'm alive
Ya I could've died
I'm the shit nigga I got ten wives
I'm just playing I got one
What you want
Walking around in Prada jeans with like 20 something
I bought two pair of Balmain jeans that's 20 hundred

[Hook]
Like when it come to hundreds that's money my way
Remember she ain't want me now she all in my face
Like uh girl you too late, you ain't got no taste
Driving to the bank, I can't close my safe
Brittany be my bae
Money in the way
Um I couldn't wait
