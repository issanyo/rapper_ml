[Verse 1: Dee-1]
I never accept no when the world says it
Only time I accept no is when a girl say it
Don't need to charges, my future looking gorgeous
Four-car garages, Omar, we do it the largest
I think about murder at the craziest times
So I body every beat and spit the deadliest rhymes
I'll never let another man hold my future in his hand
On my own two is where I stand
Yeah, done crashed whips on the road to success
Ain't showered in a week, but only funk I'm thinkin' 'bout is Flex
Had a vision, a dream, couldn't wait for a team
Became a bank slash R&B singer, started to chase the dream
And I ain't finna sell my soul
I'm tryna get on TV, but they say I ain't got remote control
But watch when destiny intervenes
You can't stop a machine, and I've been chasing dreams
A one-man army, that they soldier hated, underestimated
Bible verses kept me motivated
Concentrated, elevated, rebel, yet I'm educated
Nothing fabricated, Lil' David still tryna make it
One!

[Hook]
Failure ain't an option
(One time, one time, one time)
Failure ain't an option
(Two times, two times, two times)
Failure ain't an option
(Three times, three times, three times)
Failure ain't an option

[Verse 2: Murs]
As I look back on it all
For me to rise, I guess I had to fall
But just because you fall doesn't mean you fail
Cause fail is permanent, that's like living in hell
I could have gone another route and went to jail
Imagine my potential locked up in a cell
Imagine what potentials I locked up in my cells
I'm genetically predisposed not to fail
It's in my DNA to do well
And it means it's in my genes to excel
Put rap before my girl, didn't do so well
But now everything I write about my ex sells
You take a loss and turn it into a gain and
Load up a beat and drop a little pain in
Success is not the way to gain friends
So I guess I'll be alone when the game ends
The same way that I came in
Blessed with success, amen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tabi Bonney]
Yeah, we don't believe in much, but we believe in us
Doing bare lifts, powered by my bell (?)
In the ghetto ask God for a air lift
My pearl coming equipped with those vice grips
Holding on to dear life like a virgin on prom
Suicide bombs you know it ain't no turning back
And I'll break my arm before you pin me to a mat
Going hard 'till me see the (?) of the God
Pray that even haters see what's truly in my heart
Peace and love, the exterior just beating up
Like I'm born again, there ain't no fucking giving up
And just when you thought you had enough
Only halfway there, let's go get this million bucks
I like my steak rare, animal planet prepared
(?) read the signs, horoscope Leo
Get savage, the universe ain't patterned
Had to head up to Braille, we can go at it

[Hook]
