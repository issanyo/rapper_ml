[Verse 1: Nick Grant]
Girl you gon think I’m from Jersey
I want your name and number
I hit you from behind
Like niggas tryna jump ya
Ask you no to judge me
I guess that’s my guilty conscience
You love me then you hate me
That’s organized destruction
Girl open wide and bust it
You talking to me nasty
God said keep it classy
But heaven marked you absent
You make my heart beat faster
I pray the bras are strapless
I put my whiskers down under
Thank God I ain’t get cat fished
Beauty and the Bastard my movie needs an actress
Your nigga play you over
How he abuse a classic
The irony in that shit
You're finding me attractive
He kinda make you do it emotional entrapment
Ok my mind is dancing the girl is mine I’m asking
You gotta watch my movements
I’ll sway to find the answers
She something like the money
Gotta keep her safe
In order to be strong lets gather weeks to pray
Life is a piece of cake
Icing proceeds the taste
Don’t go against the grain
I keep my Caesar straight
I got you screaming God
That’s right just keep the faith
Yeah I’m gone lead the way
La Petite Morte (Wait)

[Chorus: B. Hess]
I ain't tryna disrespect your nigga baby, no way
But maybe you ain't never seen it better baby, my way
Cause you know if you just give me a little more, a little more
You gon' keep on giving 'til I get it all
All of your love, ooh
Give me all of your love

[Verse 2: Nick Grant]
Uh, Hey girl let’s keep a million
I’m your accountant, uh
Them curves driving me crazy I need some consoling, uh
Trying to write on the walls of your vagina, uh
Baby come be my rock and lets move some mountains
You the dopest and you know this shit
Outta sight but we get close as microscopes can get
I’m reloaded hard for him to notice this
While you keep back stroking in oceans of hopelessness
Love is blind
Sin is clear, shit I’m Overton
Living single girl they faker than a Rollie tick
Bout time you got in them jeans
Party was over with
Bout time you got in them jeans
Party was over with
Who’s Robe is this?
Girl I promise I can be everything you need and more
Unexpected I guess
Tell me who’s at the door
I’m Steph at long range
Shot my shot and its pure
I step over my feelings like people sleep on the floor
But I want ya

[Chorus: B. Hess]
I ain't tryna disrespect your nigga baby, no way
But maybe you ain't never seen it better baby, my way
Cause you know if you just give me a little more, a little more
You gon' keep on giving 'til I get it all
All of your love, ooh
Give me all of your love

[Post-Chorus/Outro: B. Hess]
I want all the love from you
That's all I need
Give all of your love to me
All of your love to me
And I'll give all of my love to you
Cause that's what you need
Girl give it all to me
All of your love
