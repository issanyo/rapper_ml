[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
They promised me that dreams would come true
But forgot to mention that nightmares are dreams too
Watching people trying to make it out they mama’s home
I just write these songs trying to make it out my comfort zone
Life is zoning in and Im collapsing by the knees
From these people who keep on telling me who and what to be
A dollar and a dream? I got some anguish and some change
Sporadic thoughts and a catalog of rhymes to ease the pain
Painstakingly planning to take over the planet with an atom bomb
Trust me when I make a mill I’ll split it down with dad and mom
A house to add it on but what is all of that
To the ones who taught you, you could be ambitious young and black
Black card with a Fleetwood Mac hey you can do it
Just make sure in it all you don’t forget to love the music
And that’s the greatest thing they ever taught me
Lose your dreams and become nothing but a carbon copy
I got dreams
[Chorus 2x]
Mama I got dreams
Mama I got dreams
Mama I got dreams
They hate to see my spotlight beam and that’s why they won't let me be
They won't let me breath
[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Working till my fingers bleed
Funny how Im dreaming but my sleep is now my enemy
I hate the bottom, patience is slowly rotting
Yo I dropped some classics back in autum you must not have got em’
There must have been a problem with the twitter links or something
To keep it blunt we hate the way they hate on us for nothing
They wanna cripple dreams like a crip out of east Compton or Chicago
Looking for a new watch with a cocked shotgun
Or half-cocked telling us stop like we got problems
For trying to be something other than teacher lawyer or doctor
Everybody just stand up, c’mon and put your hands up
This right here is the anthem, life ain't nothing but stanzas
Im just leaving a verse in the best way that I can
A dead poet in a society where they just brand us
But tell me what’s a poet if he don’t write
If I don’t change the world I just wish I could change my own life
[Chorus]
