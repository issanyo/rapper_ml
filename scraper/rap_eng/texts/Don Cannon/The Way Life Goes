[Verse 1]
That’s true
You right
Grinding every night like I’m a Mexican in Texas
I can’t fall in love with you you damage like a weapon
Put my feelings to the side I rather turn to flexing
Just got me an offer and endorsement for my backup
I be running laps around these bitches you ain’t ask her
Fucking for the money, I’m not going I’m a rapper
Everybody hating on me my come up made ‘em madder
Made ‘em madder

[Intro]
Hello?
Brrr
I like this Asian Doll

[Verse 2]
Niggas wanted me, your confidence is getting low
The feeling that I had for you no nigga could approach
Ain’t ask you for a penny, pockets balling I’m a coach
I came up by myself from dropping hits and doing the most
You look me in my eyes I ain’t believe you
Stressing over bitches, I could never, bitches see through
Thinking bout a nigga I’ma tell him “I don’t need you!”
It was no surprise I fuck with you and that’s a fact
So I take a Xanny to control the pain
I wish I never told my secrets I ain’t gain a thang
My homies told me keep that shit up, you won’t be the same
But I still fell in love with him, I chose you over fame
All this fake love turned me to a rockstar
My brother taught me 'bout these savages they got no heart
I was surprised cause I’m that bitch that finished what I started
You ain’t goofy she can’t tell apart you watermark
AK tatted on my waist
Everything come back to me you do like you got traced
Drop back cause the money get put right up in my face
I can’t feel the pain got bigger shit, that overweigh

[Pre-Chorus]
And I swear I never lose you
It's gon’ be a richer nigga played your self like voodoo
Please don’t hit my line I’m rocking show's these niggas fufu
Damn they wanna be me can’t compete I’m really too cool

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes I swear you’ll get over it
You’ll find a better life to live
I know that you’ll get over it
I know your sad and tired
You got nothing left to give
You’ll find a better life to live
I swear that you’ll get over it

[Verse 3]
Who you fooling, blaming me, no we won’t make it better
Out of line, don’t question me you know I’m bout my cheddar
Sneaky people they be changing, switch up like the weather
It’s gon’ be a realer nigga that’s gon’ get me wetter
(Uh, yeah, bitch!)
Knew I went wrong
You a robber played alone
Had to face the fact, real bitch to the bone
And I swear I never lose you (Yeah, yeah!)
It’s gon’ be a richer nigga played your self like voodoo
Please don’t hit my line I’m rocking show's these niggas fufu
Damn they wanna be me can’t compete I’m really too cool

[Chorus]
I know it hurts sometimes I swear you’ll get over it
You’ll find a better life to live
I know that you’ll get over it
I know your sad and tired
You got nothing left to give
You’ll find a better life to live
I swear that you’ll get over it

[Outro]
That’s true
You right

Just got me an offer and endorsement for my backup
I be running laps around these bitches you ain’t ask her
Fucking for the money, I’m not going I’m a rapper
