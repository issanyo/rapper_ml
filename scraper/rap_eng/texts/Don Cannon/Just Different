[Intro: B. $tacks {B$} & DJ Don Cannon {DC}]
{B$:} Yea, uh yezzir
{DC:} Is this thing on?
{B$:} Uh, uh yezzir
{DC:} Turn me up one time
{B$:} Uh, f*ck it, we here now, n*gga
{DC:} Damn right!
{B$:} Uh, look, I tell ‘em…


[Verse 1: B. $tacks]
I’m just different, stack a millie, pimpin’
Presidential swagger, b*tches blow me like I’m Clinton
I get in the game and place you lames on the benches
Give these n*ggas work, got a kilo in the trenches
I do this, I’m so ruthless, I move with cameras and shooters
And all my b*tches bougie like the actresses from Clueless
The brick’ll run you forty, get a couple, I’ll reduce it
I’m on my Young Scooter, I can make it out, produce it
Don’t mix me with all these music dudes
No scripted character, not into making Looney Tunes
And that’s real
While these rap n*ggas workin’ on they next deal
We dinin’ at that fresco, plottin’ on our next mill’
That underworld money, livin’ how connects live
Nike contract, I know how them checks feel
Don’t bulletproof the ride, pay killers, tail behind
Put the life all on the line, for the n*gga they behind
Real boss, boy don’t let the AIDS f*ck you up
I’m twenty-two today, but all my clips thirty plus
I hit the A and link with real n*ggas gettin’ bucks
Couple plugs, when it’s rough, drought come, keep in touch!
State to state with the traffickin’
Global distribution is immaculate
Getting money n*gga, uh
And we do this on the regular
Just a couple of reasons while I’m ahead of ya’s
$tacks!


[DJ Cannon]
I mean, what you thought?
He wasn’t gonna get a intro from the number one co-signer?
I know you would love that
We never worried about what y’all n*ggas was thinkin’
While y’all lose sleep about this sh*t
We do this in our sleep
{Laughs}
So don’t think for one second
That we ain’t gonna feed these streets as usual
We come from a different cloth
I mean we just different


[Verse 2: B. $tacks]
Uh, I’m just different
I don’t need to gimmick ‘cause I live it
And I don’t have to do it, hell I did it
Did what? Hit your strip with thirty in my clip
Let them hollows rip and circle back to see who hit
Paid dues, several shoo’ers that made news
No musical chairs, I’m stickin’ with the same crew
See n*ggas divide, but that just how the game do
What this fame bring when you ain’t mainstream?
Ride the same streets, car dirty, dick clean
Hoes choose daily when your neck and wrist gleam
It’s like every chick a model, and every b*tch sing
I f*ck ‘em to sleep, and let the b*tch dream
Nighty-night for you rap n*ggas
Ten bricks in the drought
Stizzle back n*gga to lap n*ggas
I Clap n*ggas, rap chickens, unwrap chickens
Hustle all white, baby it’s a black bi’ness
Word play exclusive, Don Cannon produced it
But little did he know he gave a track to a shooter (bah!)
Well advised fit, just a samplin’ kit
Bars like a clip, it’s homicide in the mix


[Outro: DJ Don Cannon]
Grand opening, grand never closing
Get used to seeing us around these parts
I mean you can get down with us
If you need applications, holla at us
If you need a loan, you can holla at us
{Laughs}
Just remember, if you need anything
You can come holla at us
The root of all evil, B. $tacks
Welcome!
