[Intro Yung Curt]
Cough, cough
Nah I dont smoke i'm just trynna clear my throat

[Verse 1 Yung Curt]
Galactic dreams... black hole nightmares
Trying to do my thing hopefully I’m right there
Im feeling like a prince aware I’m the right heir
Riding with my team we vibing up in the night air

I’ve been the guy that they love to hate
Never showed me love but I know my fate
Feelin like the best and theres no debate
Killing girls softly go and euthanate

I’ve been the best no promo
Boys will ride dick and swear its no homo
The rap game I’ve got it up in a chokehold
Reminiscing back to when I couldn’t go hoco

Cause the girls didn’t want me then
Didn’t want relation they just wanted friends
Till they come to the realization that imma ten
Now I’m onto better things and they lost their heads

School isn’t my thing Id rather stay spitting
While you was doing math I was making writtens
While you was doing chem I had found my fission
Just got my permit but always been driven

A tsunami when my wave is coming
Yeah you got a hot track but you ain't saying nothing
I got that food for thought for these aching stomachs
You on the rise for a week and then your stakes'll plummet

My flow game like a marathon
I’m taking drastic measures word to capadonn
Imma muhfucking king bitch ill slap a pawn
I’m just just trynna ball out going past lebron

You not in my league so step back tebow
Talking foul shit imma probably take a free-throw
Hit you with a hook take ya bike like debo
My bars go hard man your bars stay feeble

My girl left about a week ago
A couple good friends I always keep em close
Steady classified I stay up with my secret hoes
I take these kids to school trynna teach em flows

But they never seem to listen right
They’d rather hit a lick steady gripping nines
Ya girl wanna strip heard I hit it nice
Two girls one curt got a kitten fight

Get ya girl wet like the churches reverend
24/7 tell me I’m a blessing
Sexin everyday the shit seems so incessant
Get her 7 for 27 just to send a message

[Verse 2 Yung Curt]

And Im back like I never left
Shawdy got some shit trynna get off her chest
Start with bra and then pull off the rest
Feel the tension in the room as we stand abreast

I’m the man but I stay pretty though
Another different night another different hoe
I keep my flow tight incase you trynna go
I’m just trynna raise the bar word to flamin moe

Rewrite my shit 40 times to shine like Edison
My homies gotta cough so they downing the medicine
Mixing ganja with drank now they popping them sedatives
Get ignored as a spitta just because of my melanin

But I still rip it smacking beats up till they timid
Im a young cynic these kids they all some critics
Imma go get it hit yo girl she give me digits
And im so gifted my GIEP is on exhibit

If you want it you get it, get it straight how you live
Shawdy ripped through my heart stabbed my back wit a shiv
I’m just trynna move on I’m in my feels at the crib
On my face theres a smile but theres problems within

Fucking hoes the only remedy
Lil drank big dick thats the recipe
Million dollar mind pulling equity
I’m just trynna' leave behind a wild legacy

Wet and wild on spring break
Smashing on the bed till the springs break
You jesters never know what the king makes
Never been a baker but I cream cakes

I don’t smoke cuz theres snakes up in the grass
Fuck puff puff I’m just trynna' fucking pass
I ain't worried bout the cheese I’m just worried bout the rats
Cuz when you get the hype everybody on yo ass

I do my thing till I can’t no more
Im just trynna' make it big going on my own
Like a young boxer gotta show the ropes
Bit up off my style hope yall don't choke


Yo whole styles been played out
You never busted guns put that thing down
I’m just trying to eat off green like a bean sprout
Blowing black and white heads I’m trying to break out

Catch the wave like a riptide
You got a fan base cuz you shanghaied
Ride so much dick swear you bang guys
Im binded to my grind never satisfied
