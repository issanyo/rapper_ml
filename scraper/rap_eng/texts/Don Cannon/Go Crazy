[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Guess who's bizzack?
Still smell the blow in my clothes
Like Krispy Kreme, I was cooking them O's
Like horseshoes, I was tossing them O's
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow
I'm emotional, I hug the block
I'm so emotional, I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa
It's kinda hard to be drug-free
When Georgia Power won't give a nigga lights free
Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Buy 18 the hard way
Have a humble nigga thinking about gun play
Now who the fuck wanna play with guns?
A lot of holes, a lot of blood, dog...the shit ain't fun
So I suggest you don't play with my chains
I'll send these hollows atchya, let em play with ya brain
The streets is watching, the name is warm
The product's white, a star is born (Yeah!)
And I'm so fly, if I take this parachute off, I might fall and die
Wrap the work like spandex with the latex
Then we ship it out of town, call it safe sex

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
More than a hustler, I'm the definition of it
Master chef, Lord of the kitchen cupboard
More than a street legend, homie, it's Hova
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer
The Mariano of the Mariott
If money talks, the whole world's 'bout to hear me out
See, I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean
Attract money, my worst color is light green
My favorite hue is Jay-Z Blue
Don't follow me, young'un, follow my moves, I'm not a role model
My bad influence got the world drinking gold bottles
When Puff was in that tub spilling Mo'
I was at my video, Cris' on the speedboat
In My Lifetime, nigga, go through your research
St. Thomas, my nigga, that was me first
Chrome-shoe'd the GS, I came feet-first
In the game like a baby born to breech birth
I got the keys if you need work
I can kingpin you a line, a dime at a time
My niggas love it when I talk like this
My corporate people start bugging 'cause I talk like this
The corporate thugs is like "Nah Hov', talk that shit
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy Jay-Z!"
See I'ma '80s baby, master of Reaganomics
School of Hard Knocks, every day is college
You ain't did nothing I ain’t did, nigga pay homage
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed llami's
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm being honest
Ya ain’t pull my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check
They say the truth shall come to the light
So everybody grab your shades 'cause your boy that bright
Goodnight!

[Chorus: Young Jeezy]
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang
When they play that new Jeezy all the dope boys go crazy
And watch the dope boys go crazy
I pop my collar then I swing my chain
You can catch me in the club, pimping, doing my thang
