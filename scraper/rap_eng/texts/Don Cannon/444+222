[Intro]
Okay I'm ready

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4
4, 4, 4, 4
Million on me, JAY-Z
Count off, fuck nigga, pay, me

[Bridge]
Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"
Got it too lit like "pipe down"
No I can't wait need it right now
Get guap, I'm the one that she like now
Count it up, from the morning to the night now
That's the reason that a nigga wanna fight now?
'Cause my diamonds shine like a lighthouse?
Pull up, walk in
Everybody yell like "watch out"
That be Maaly Raw

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down

4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million on me, JAY-Z

[Verse 1]
Woah, fuck your bitch, I'm bored
Rockstar, that's of course
White girl like Lorde
She don't really get too impressed, Honda Accord
'Long as she get her beauty rest, then I'm aboard
Got that girl wet, she need three towels (ayy)
Call my phone like every day on speed dial
Hundred thousand, new watch, got like three dials
I don't eat out, hit once, leave out
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Back it up, rack it up
Told that bitch, "Back it up"
Thirty nails, hammer tucked
So there's no way that you jamming us (no way)

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breath in, breath in
Breath out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million on me, JAY-Z
Count off, fuck nigga, pay me

[Verse 2]
Pull up, sauce got the drip (skrr)
Foreign broads, like 'em mixed
Bulldog with a pit
Bulldog with a grip
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)
Million on me, JAY-Z
Count off, fuck nigga, pay me
All these niggas yeah, hate me (why?)
Covered in that water, waist deep
Pull up in that Lam, just me
My niggas pullin' up, eight deep (what's up)

[Chorus]
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast
Slow down
4, 4, 4, 4 (ayy, ayy)

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe out, shake that ass
Speed up, go fast

Million, on me, JAY-Z
