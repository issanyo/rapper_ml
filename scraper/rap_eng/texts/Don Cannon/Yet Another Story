[Intro]
Homie still hoopin', the ho still hoein'
Can't end the story, the story still goin'
Homie still hoopin', the ho still hoein'

[Verse]
So I'm still smashing this ho from over a year ago
You remember when I told you about the basketball player's lady?
We took a break but we've been back on lately
With me she been moving to NY City and homie being trady
Secret rendezvous, they came more complicated
Been for a week in the past two months
She been flying me to Vegas and buying me what I want
Trees and kicks all on the bitch I can't front
Monday trips paying on the expense of her man
She circling that 'passenger pick up' until I land
But in the midst of the fucking and gateway druggin'
Shawty done got sloppy, homie came up on somethin'
Bitch done forgot to sign out of her twitter
Now pimpin fishin' through all of our private DM's and...
Online history show she's been purchasing tickets from a credit card in his name he didn't know existed
Now her iphone ringin', she answered it
I heard him on the other end panicking
Talking about when he see it how he gon' handle it
And what his goons gon' do to whatever man she with
