C’mon homey we major (We major)

[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
I hate this, relatively famous
Pen full of rhymes and a heart full of anguish
Self-promotion, me and D ain’t complaining, pacing and making calls to all those radio stations
Play this, Yeah come on play this
Promise all of your listeners will put this on their playlist
No?
Well okay forget the radio
But if I don’t hit the radio then what is they gonna pay me for?
Racing like four four forty’s for notoriety
Sick of sobriety, sick of niggas that lie to me
Sick of writing societies life and lies in a diary
Spitting writtens at shows and hoping that they admire me
Im tired
And frankly Im exhausted
You see, rapping is a habbit and my passion I just hope I haven’t lost it
But

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Big Shot Bob with the way I play the background
I embody Ginobili the Kobes just get they raps out
Out with all the anonymous, still Im searching for dominance
Dogmatically dogging em’, Labels is trying to cop him
He dodge em’ just like the coppers with pockets leaking that copper
They think he’s copping the profit instead Im eating Hot Pockets
And pocketing flows, dreaming of stands and the rows
Selling out shows in stadiums for these fans out in Vancouver
The man, the panned loser who sat in his home
All alone with that tablet rapping that frog in his throat out
Till he croaked in his own room
No friends in his home room
So he had some more time to write up his own tunes
That’s cool, cause now half of them niggas tweeting collabs
They see me as a come up, I really see it as sad
So I work with who I want cause Im working with what I have
I just wanna get this work up off my dad
Tell him
[Chorus]
