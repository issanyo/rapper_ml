[Verse 1]
She in love
Maybe I'm the one you think you know
I got a crazy ass mixture in my cup
A nigga balling, now they can't tell me no
Baby, that's why she be on the tough
Know she like me cause I be teaching her stuff
Or cause she love it when I be fucking her rough
I don't know what it is but she can't get enough

[Chorus]
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love
Said we just finished making hella good love
Yeah, we just finished making hella good love
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love

[Verse 2]
She in love
Scheming for the D, she get her whole
She hold it down cause I keep her going up
Far from that nigga rubbing bubbles in your tum
Only reason she be on me tough
Them niggas boring, over here, she get a rush
Won't even let her spend a night after we fuck
It's kinda crazy but she never get enough

[Chorus]
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love
Said we just finished making hella good love
Yeah, we just finished making hella good love
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love

[Bridge]
I got her sprung, gave it to her, now she going dumb
Ain't gotta ask cause she just give me what I want
And all these other niggas can't tell her nothing
She knew what it was from the jump
So ain't no need for me to keep her in the cut
I know she like it when I be fucking it up
I don't know what it is but she can't get enough

[Chorus]
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love
Said we just finished making hella good love
Yeah, we just finished making hella good love
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
I think she like that I don't give a fuck
We might fuck around and spend the week laying up
And we just finished making hella good love
