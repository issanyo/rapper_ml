[Verse 1: Jay Anfernee]
Your hate pass through me like I'm a hologram. My life ain't controlled by no triple-six pentagram
Niggas wanna get my nerve tightened, sit back and stroke it like guitar strings
I'll be real quiet whenever shit goes down, but even church mice gotta fight for their cheese.
I wanna thank everyone who pressures me through my struggles even though I tell 'em to stop but they just don't
Listen to these words containing the stress I'd be bitching about
Hoes gaining thirst, they want the "D" in the "drought"
Still searching for the key to the door of eternity, cuz with the church pass key I'm still locked out
Whatever my companions or rivals or families or haters say about me, you shouldn't believe a word cuz ain't nobody
Knows what I'm thinking, and how much wrongs of this world that I can take in
Tell me what is fame. When everybody starts to ride your dick when you get to earn some credit with your name?
A month or two flies, they start to drift away? Then you unzip that fame and they on the dick again?
I was going in circles with my life, now my blueprint's finally laid like it was lacking sex
But people wanna look down upon you when you doing just you and you tell it like you see it
Frankly, it don't shock me at all, cuz everybody's blind while they living all their days
Me? Since I'm the weird one I see shit in black and white while I'm living black.and.grey.

[Outro]
And I know you can't stand the truth, but I guess I'm living proof. Whatever I'm not just made me into what I really am
And I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but it's not about what you wanted. I'm gonna live my motherfucking life anyway I can
