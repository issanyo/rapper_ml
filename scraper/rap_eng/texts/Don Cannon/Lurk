[Mixtape Intro: DJ Don Cannon]
I know you read our names like "when are they ever gon' stop?"
Never! Don Cannon, DJ Drama, back in The Neighbourhood
Black and white! You should've knew better
Another one

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
This is the beat that makes your mother cry
This is the beat that makes your mother cry

[Verse 1]
I want to be honest, I want to be bad
I want to destroy you, I want to move fast
I want the attention, I want all the cash
I want all the ass, is that too much to ask?
I want to be faithful, I want to be raw
I want to be ignorant, I want to know all
I want to die someday, I want to live long
I want what I ask for, I get what I want

[Chorus]
I'm thinking we should ride
To a place that we don't know
To a place where no one's seen us before
I'm thinking you and I
Better just go with the flow
Last thing that we should do is go slow
I'm thinking we should ride
To a place that we don't know
To a place where no one's seen us before
I'm thinking you and I
Better just go with the flow
Last thing that we should do is go slow

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
This is the beat that makes your mother cry
This is the beat that makes your mother cry

[Verse 2]
I think that I'm human, I think about God
I think of the chances, I think that I'm wrong
I think to be thoughtful, I know that I'm not
You think I'm a fake, and I know you're a fraud
I fuck cause I need to, I fuck when I want
I'll fuck you in love, even though it is not
I'll fucking digest you one kiss at a time
You wish I was yours, and I hope that you're mine

[Chorus]
I'm thinking we should ride
To a place that we don't know
To a place where no one's seen us before
I'm thinking you and I
Better just go with the flow
Last thing that we should do is go slow
I'm thinking we should ride
To a place that we don't know
To a place where no one's seen us before
I'm thinking you and I
Better just go with the flow
Last thing that we should do is go slow
Go fast, go fast (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!)
Go fast, go fast (this is the beat that makes your mother cry)
(This is the beat that makes your mother cry)

[Outro]
Oh no, hmm, da-da, da-da
Black and it’s white
Everything’s white, but it’s blacker than I know
Even blacker than the white of the snow, yeah
And all that I, no, no
No, no, no, no
