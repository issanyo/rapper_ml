[Verse 1: Maestro J]
Mr. Johnson's in the place but call me Maestro
'Cause I can heat this bitch up just like I'm pyro
I'm picture perfect like a Peyton Manning spiral
With 16 bars to spare, I can blow up off this viral
My shit is vital like a violin recital
With cellos and the cymbals now I'm hitting all the right notes
I hit the right spot nigga that's the G-spot
And I'll have your girl squealing like a little tea pot
My kettle's blacker than a 9 milli packer
Under Dungaree's and Docker's
I'm sending niggas to doctors
I'm crossing the comp like Crawford
I'm teaching my songs like Sanford
I'm fucking raw with no manners
I'm going berserk, bananas
Got the bangers in the trunk and a pound of loud
That crowd control that gives a nigga chills when he's down
I pop some uppers for supper to feel a vibe
Feel the cold of this world and I just wanna feel alive
A sharper mind I do possess so I don't feel stress
I moves ahead on these pawns like I'm playing chess
I put in on my chest that I will rise above the rest
And now me and my tribe is on a never ending quest
But none the less I keep it moving like a four way
Keep it swanging so I'm taking up all the four lanes
Got panels in the panoramic for a picture
While I break down this purple and pack it in a split swisher
Oh word?
Got panels in the panoramic for a picture
While I break down this purple and pack it in a split swisher

[Verse 2: ODCS]
Headphones on, I'm rolling, zoning, controlling
I'm overdosing from flowing hoping I don't get frozen
In the wintertime breeze
The finish line is seen
Not far from my reach
Been spending my G's
Living by the week
Wishing I could be
The best like Ali, but I'm on my way
On sight like Kanye, golly all these
Roadblocks that I see, like geez
Ambition and dedication
Switch it and educate 'em
While they witness the devastation
Of an innocent instrumental
Skinning it with my pencil
Been on this incidental since I was just really little
Surviving it with some scholarships now I am just
Up on top of it vibing with my entire clique
Rocking proper like the Poppa 'cause now I am big
Someone call the doctor to stop my heart from dying, quick
Like I'mma quit this fire is entirely
Gonna burn this environment to a tiny speck
Should'a learned that when I dismissed
The entire list of rhymes I've writ
Thrill them like Michael did
Th-pitting it like a lithp

[Hook: ODCS & Maestro J]
And I just let go of yesterday
'Cause yesterday is history
And it might hold some memories
But now that's all that it is to me (x3)
