[Intro]
Yeah, uh huh, yeah
This is extraterrestrial music
`Cause we're extraterrestrial
Yo, Banshee, Lamp, let's go

[Hook - Banshee]
Vortex in the sky spinning round, round, round
Shooting stars blast by hear the sound, sound, sound
We are all creatures of the universe
If you wanna create it you gotta dream it first
Now we walking on the sun, sun, sun

[Verse 1 - Lamp]
Blast off, astronaut
Discovering new worlds in the blind spot
Never been vision impaired
So high I can see the whole world from here
I got the wind in my hair
Crystalized lungs, I ain't give a care
Dreams don't feel this real
No gravity, ferris wheel

[Verse 2 - Banshee]
All I know is astronomy
What is life, yo, I never took biology
Dare to prepare for takeoff
Thrusters ignite
Soaring high into flight in the middle of the night
Feeling alright
Zoom zoom, say what's up to the man in the moon
This is out of sight
Sheezy

[Hook - Banshee]
Vortex in the sky spinning round, round, round
Shooting stars blast by hear the sound, sound, sound
We are all creatures of the universe
If you wanna create it you gotta dream it first
Now we walking on the sun, sun, sun

[Verse 3 - Banshee]
From up here ET couldn`t see me
Beam me up Scotty like on TV
Stars surround me, they all astound me
In space no one can hear you scream, listen to the sound B
Nothing, nothing, nothing
Adapt to the cold like an arctic puffin
Puffin, nothing, nothing, nothing
Across the galaxy searching for something

[Verse 4 - Lamp]
Explore without the map
On Mars you're not greeted with a welcome mat
Little green men, aliens
And I ain't talking about Mexicans
This the type of stuff that makes you want to text your friend
Like dude we gotta do this again
We gotta do this again
Lamp

[Hook - Banshee]
Vortex in the sky spinning round, round, round
Shooting stars blast by hear the sound, sound, sound
We are all creatures of the universe
If you wanna create it you gotta dream it first
Now we walking on the sun, sun, sun
