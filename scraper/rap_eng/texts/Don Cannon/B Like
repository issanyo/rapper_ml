[Verse 1]
Why all these niggas stay hating on a boy
Can’t a young nigga get money anymore?
Why none of these rap niggas be 100 anymore
I just say fuck it and pull up in something colder than before
Pedal to the floor, gas, no brakes when I’m dipping
No you don’t want issues, why the hell is niggas tripping
You comparing us, [?] something wrong with your vision
I make money, money don’t make me, that be the difference
Glasses [?] from my neck to my toes
Still got the plug do whatever for the low
Skinny pimp got that hustle and flow
If you tryna get paid then I’m the nigga you should know

[Hook]
I keep it G like that
Kill shit, like I borrowed some of TI’s straps
Money made the whole world, look at me like that
Can’t explain how I do it, it just be like that
It just be like that, it just be like that
If I ever take a break on the cake know I be right back
It sound brazy but it be like that, it’s something real though

[Verse 2]
Red diamonds in the Rolex, my prezzy got a mad face
Money raised, guess I’ll never come in last place
Mike can make the beat that make her ass shake
I turn her to the max like I’m tryna make the glass break
That’s just the type of shit I be on
Blood money, you ain’t made it, nothing do what we on
Same nigga they would sleep on be the one that’s stacking dollars to infinity and beyond
And now I eat with niggas that’ll starve with me
From no hoes and shows to ménage in suites
See baby Skeme be that nigga that be hard to meet
Getting head from girls that used to hardly speak

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
On the checks made 25 A
25 hours every day straight
If you ain’t getting money get up out the way
By any means necessary, get the cake, wait
See I’m a nigga with money and I don’t love that bitch
But tell me how you love that shit
I’m the type to hold 100 racks, count it right in front that bitch
Tell her ass I’ll kill her if she touch that shit

[Hook]
