This is steves j bryan baby

Eyes open mind focus on success, I keep a clean spirit that's the way to be the best
I burn incense get money from Google AdSense, the hustle's online I get likes fuck comments
I’m connected to the people like their mobile phones
They get attached to a nigga like their pets at home
Immigrant I’m married to the money now I'm legal
But the flo so dope they might deport me from the eagle
Don't worry it's not gon happen
Like an inventor I contribute to change the system
The movement’s high mind, cause with our brains we achieving
Clean feet strong legs put us in this position
To sit next to ambassadors discussing about millions
5 star hotels like champagne we chilling
And women share their smiles to the sound of the power
And open everything if your words come out proper
I'm serious I’m as nice as I look
The world is a meat so consider that cooked
Souls a stove and I eat it with accomplishment
Look I'm not good I'm excellent
So we are not the same I am important in tuned with the universe I'm omnipotent
Hater’s gon act like its nothing and they don't love it
Deep inside you already know they wanna hug it
I keep it moving like the planet, so I'm spinning on myself
Making smart moves in other words investing in my wealth
I spit the kind of rap that makes poverty disappear
I got the recipe to bring the flavor in ya ear
So fuck outta here each verse I spit is kind of like an episode
I leave the public hook and i ain’t even in beast mode
G code and you gon feel who the fuck I am
I show the world what's real it's like Pac had an Instagram
Game changer you stuck on Hi 5 I be on fyuse
Snapchating my story while Periscoping up my news
Bitch I'm so connected I'm a branch
Any rapper who claim they got a flow my lyrics will make it stanch
I keep it real and will kill the game is bill, I leave it done deal and will steal the spot for real
I got that College rap, yo my joints keep your speakers smoking
Turn up the volume I’m who your girls praising
You not allowed to smoke on campus,  I'm who your teachers blazing
Cause My rap is kinda like exploring
I Make these rapper sound like annoying cousins
Talking bout what they bought on family reunion
And I’m dunking on you niggas cause you stay bored
Look I'm cool kind of like Mc fly on a hover board
I'm so a head of my time it's like I'm living twice
It ain't new to me I was made for this life
Success is a déjà vu I'm familiar with this life
I been practicing my Grammy speech ever since I was 19
Now I'm 26 gotta recite it on the big screen
Look You don't understand I got the power
Sing my life like I'm in the shower
The only water coming down on me is abundance
I clean myself with the soap of self-conscience
Dude I am the sniper I will kill this
I’m not gonna lie man I can’t miss
