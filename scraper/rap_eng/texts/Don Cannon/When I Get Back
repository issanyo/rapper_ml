[Intro: DJ Drama & Jesse Rutherford]
Black and white, The Neighbourhood
The west coast is the best coast
The best smoke, the best weather
The best bitches, can't wait 'till my flight land, hahah
G-Eazy, fuck with us

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
When I get back to California
I'll see my sister and my momma
I'll tell my friends about my fast life
Because they know me from my past life
When I get back to California
I'll smoke a pound of marijuana
I'll sit inside and watch the sun set
All by myself in my apartment, oh
I'll take the long way home
When I get back to California
I hope it puts my paranoia
On pause, 'cause I'm not a God, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I've got no time to kill
But when I get home, maybe I will

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I'll be home soon, yeah, uh
Killing brain cells, killing time
When I finally get back, I'll be feeling fine
Hope I get to chill out in my twenties while I'm still in mine
Tap right out the matrix but I'm just out here maneuvering until it's time (Yeah)
On the road, know my girl be goin' through it
But I'm a fucking star and I know I was born to do it
Summer's gone and past, I'm always touring through it
And my penthouse apartment's feeling more like an expensive storage unit (Damn)
Oh well, poor guy, in real life I'm more shy
I just wanna hide, they just be like "Bruh, but for why?"
Everybody wants a favor or a slice of your pie
Live a fast life, I'ma either get rich or die (Yeah)
So I pass out, faded, then I dream of home
Thinking 'bout that time I really need a loan
I'ma go for walks around the town, you might even see me roam
Fuck it, I don't even really need a phone
Man, I'm just tryna chill

[Pre-Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I've got no time to kill
But when I get home
Maybe I will

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California
I can't wait to get back to California

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
I know the sun's still shining
