[Mind]
Wow, this project is actually dope
Like this thing go hard

[Verse 1]
I'm so saucy
Hoe back off me
All these rappers scared cause my flow so daunting
She call me daddy like big homie
Yea I'm a bad boy
The problem is I'm not ready for kids
Ha, no time for the noise
Mad is too real and his bars are too ill
Had to eat that kale salad, couldn't have happy meals
Them twenty four hour shifts that mama had stint left Mahdi real pissed still couldn't pay the bills
He was sitting on the floor, space heater on high freezing from the core
He was ready for war, been a cold soul since he was 'bout four
Blood thirsty, all the teachers would worry he would pop off and leave someone in the morgue
Fire in his eyes, like a lion in his heart
The rhymes in his mind, like Picasso with the art
I shine bright though my skin is real dark
Blacker than the sky where the moon and stars are
A young menace making all your dogs bark
Or maybe it's the pussies man all of y'all marks
I drop bars with pick ups, that's big cars
Like Martin I'll march for a good cause
I put numbers on the boards, it ain't no surprise every time I score
Yea, I put numbers on the boards

(Bridge)
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more

[Verse 2]
I run the whole team and the best in the league
Taking victories and it makes these haters bleed
Cause I got the key, to success
These other artists trash time to clean up the mess
A top prospect you could say I'm up next
Fly like a bird man I need some respe-k
Cash money for the tour, watch me as I put all of these numbers on the board
And I'm giving no space
Up real close to where I'm spitting in your face
Like Ace wanna be paid in full, so in that case, I must raise up and rule
But the main tool I use is my new groove
That's the flow, my words slowly touch your soul
Even though I used to be poor I still put numbers on the boards
I put numbers on the boards
I put numbers on the boards
