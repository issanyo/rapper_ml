So here goes a story
Of me, and me
About Low Low
It's a story you don't know so
Listen up and give a fuck
Started out 13
Life is mean
But he still had a dream
Drugs started
And it all really started
From departed
And it came from the hearted
Peace and love shit
I bet you wanna dub this
I bet you dig this
I bet you think this shit is
Shit is mean
Shit is mean
Shit is me
And I think it's really groovy
Hey, hey love what it does?
Is you who you say you was?
Can you do what you say you does?
Do you really think that you can save us?

You'll prolly see her if you're lookin out the window
She walks slow so
You can't miss her
I'll bet you miss her
I'll bet you miss her
I'll bet you think about her every day
And every way that she's gone you say
She's on drugs, and she's on you say
And she may never come back again
I said she may never come back again
Well fuck it
We better off without her
I never ever doubt her
To be on
Anything but marijuan'
You get it?
She did it
Yeah now she's dead it
I'll bet it
So I dread it
I mourn for her
I pray for her
I hope that she gets better
But she never, never ever
Gets any better
She stays there

I said it's for me
And this is real stoner music, I do it
I said nobody does it like me
