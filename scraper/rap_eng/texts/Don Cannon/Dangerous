[Music Video Intro: Jesse Rutherford]
(Car engine revs)
Oh, come on
Ah, fuck, come on, dude

[Intro: Jesse Rutherford]
Ridin' round in my city, same thing I used to do
Got a new girl with me
I could have another one if I wanted to but no
Might call another one this afternoon, I wonâ€™t

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Ridin' round in my city, same thing I used to do
Got a new girl with me
I could have another one if I wanted to but no
Might call another one this afternoon, I won't
I did it, look who I brought with me
Ridin' round your city, vibin' out in your city
Sold out in your city, but I think you earned this
I feel like you're worth it
Your blue eyes and those red lips
That got you on my guest list
Don't talk much, I don't say shit
And you lay down and we make it up (make it up, make it up, make it up, make)
Fuck what your mother say, let's run away
We play on that gold chain
Drivin' round in my Escalade
Doin' 88 on PCH, let's go (go, go)

[Hook: Jesse Rutherford]
We're made to love, we're made to love
We're made to love, we're made to love
But you're dangerous, you're dangerous, you're dangerous
For both of us, you're dangerous

[Interlude: Jesse Rutherford]
Hmm, hmm
(Phone rings)
(Answer the phone nigga)
(Nigga, answer the phone)

[Verse 2: YG]
Texting and calling while I'm with my bitch
You be puttin' me thru some shit
But that pussy good as shit
Now she goin' thru my shit
Ask me "who is this?", "who's that?"
Smell my dick and asked last night where you was at
So if I lie now she'll probably find the truth later
But if I tell the truth she'll probably wanna leave the player
And if she leave the player, who I'm gon' fuck with?
Can't fuck with you cause you too comfortable being my side bitch
But fuck that, I told her
Damn, that wasn't smart, damn, I fucked up
Now that arguing 'bout to start
She like "who is this, did she suck yo dick? Always that same way, YG, do you love this bitch? This the same chick from last time, I saw you creepin' wit, you took her out to eat and shit, ooh, I hate this bitch"
God damn, I gotta put an end to this triangle relationship
I gotta stay away from you 'cause your pussy too dangerous

[Hook: Jesse Rutherford]
We're made to love, we're made to love
We're made to love, we're made to love
(Hey, but you, babe, you're dangerous)
But you're dangerous, you're dangerous, (you're danger) you're dangerous
For both of us, you're dangerous
