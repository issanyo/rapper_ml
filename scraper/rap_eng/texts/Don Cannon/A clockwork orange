A clockwork orange (open letter)

[Skanky]
I heard ya girl pussy be looking like Contra/ (ill)
I am like I 911 porsha (porsche)/
I am like two tons of gold bars
Like fort Knox/
Girls don't force the box/ ,they just chill (chill)
Chest like a meat locker/
I'm cool about most mommas/
Even though, hoes got mouth
Like llamas/
Lets labamba/
I took that girl, dance the forbidden dance/
Carried mo bodies than a ambulance/
Drugs was like a hobby
Rap is the profession/
So I play it for my team like a short stop, when I'm leading/
More like the pitcher/
I pitch a no hitter/ (strike em out man)
Flow gets sicker with chicken
Salmanella/
Broke niggas want me to see they vision, like I ain't got my own/
I need a lab coat and a classroom in my zone/
I'm a need my pockets fat like the klumps/
Breaking out? My pockets got the mumps/
Shit I need my pockets fat like women that pay yo bills/
You settle for less, I dont settle for deals/
Skank dollar two steps from emit till/
Cause I got more yards than enmity Smith can yield/ (dreads)
You tryna kill that lil boy for checking out that white girl/
I got stomach virus on tracks
I'm bout to hurl/
When they take our guns then the truth is revealed/ (yeah)
No second amendment no chances for real/
You cut down the first one just for ya press/ (yes)
This is not Spanish, I'm speaking English/ (yes!)
This is two letters in ya hair like wingworms/
Blaze the cochella like cheech and chong/
Tell ya girl to watch my throne,,
Laundromat
Wash yo ass up like rich connect  alone/
I gave you two letters/
New York is the feature/
In the belly of the beast I'm to wise for lakid (ugh)/
Skanky baby, don't rap to good/
Police done had enough of Zoe people up in they Hood/
Individually such a bully but so calm/
I be looking Anthony coming back from Nam/ (the money)
You bout to get me aggy like
Red in the poolhall/ (cowboy)
I got more game out here than pooch hall/
You acting like I'm eating with grey poupon/
Guess I've been in these chains to long/
Two letters, I be in hoes so long I need a poncho/
That's why the mixtape like a hundred hit combo/


What!?! Y'all ain't learn anyway! !


Feds try keep me in a digital cell/
Cause my ad all red like digicell/
Ya intel for p.c.....Intel inside/
Bitch you mad cause I treat ya b.m. like a slide/
Yea baby you just a photo/
Singing like 10cc's
I don't call my dojo/
My flow give ya whole world mouth to mouth/
Breath life in to my bodies
Found dead on they couch/
Shit,,, Y'all ain't learn anyway
Substitute teacher's
Mini skirts under the waist/
Not much to mention/
Just remind em its free/
It dont cost to pay attention/
But ill charge you a fee/
This a penny for ya thoughts/
Cause niggas is dropping dimes like they left with new York/ (ohhh)
Mannn y'all ain't learn away
Y'all tricks a globetrotter

Ball like a lebron James/
High-school days/
More scouts on me than Damon Wayne's/ (message)
More dout about you, than legalizing Cain/
A clockwork orange on Alex brain/
