Verse 1 (Red Cafe)
Hah
I got a bad habit
Every night I gotta touch another bad chick
But I ain't selfish
I pass it
I'm the top gun
I'm Maverick
Sip champagne out the World Cup
Clique in front of the club, I'm feeling a swerve up
I'm feeling ball out
I brought my dogs out
What you drinking on mama we bought it all out
Yeah!
Now it's on
I'm in the zone
I got my kush barked up I'm getting blown
That redberry got me sauced up
Dem other niggas spendin shorts tell 'em boss up
Come fly wit me
I'm livin in the sky
I got it wraped up
A ribbon in the sky
And Ciara if you really wanna ride
Then you should saddle up and we can fucking go live

Chorus (Red Cafe)
Every day I win (win)
I can never lose (lose)
I just do it how the mother fuckin best do
I got this (i got this)
I got this (i got this)
Believe dat
What else? (x2)

Verse 2 (Lore'l)
I finish in the lead
Fuck'em make 'em leave (yeah)
Trophy wife where South East is in the League
A dog in Dior
Importing my decor
Get off on important calls  tickling his balls
Malls men and money
Is all a bitch fathom
Unless he on the Forbes list I ain't lookin at him
Tongue kiss the Madam (mwa)
Curtsy and crumpets
Toot your horn (that's right)
I can blow a trumpet
My Louie arm strong I got a lot of bags
I jump in the coupe bent (vroom)
Hit the gas
Shit on I get on and make 'em kiss my ass
Tongue out pantyless
Feel the drag
Cam Newton
Play 'em then I pass
Catch me on a hill
Laurie Conrad (yeah)
My Luis Scott box know folks in high places
With Trey Songz making love to his faces (uh)

Chorus (Red Cafe)
Every day I win (win)

I got this (i got this)

Verse 3 (Red Cafe)
Yeah and I'm so fucking flashy
If I can pick one girl it would probably be Cassie
Meanwhile I need a chick that's classy
With her own shit I ain't trying to loan shit
Super seraphin while I'm out pedaling
Graveyard shift every night Dave Letterman
In the the club look divas everywhere
Got Michelles, Lisa and Keyshas everywhere
And it’s beauty day, LV, Gucci day
Hair, nails and brazilian wax booty day
In front of  lights and the cameras
Brown hair, blue eye, malibu tanners
So hot ya guy need a personal fanner
More money please who said I ain’t got manners (huh)
Every day I’m eating dinner
Poping champaign, corks, toasting with winners
Its movin !


Chorus (Red Cafe)
Every day I win (win)
I can never lose (lose)
I just do it how the muh fuckin best do
I got this (i got this)
I got this (i got this)
Believe that
What else? (x2)
