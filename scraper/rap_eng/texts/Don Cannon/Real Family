I come from a real family
Shit might get crazy if you try to play me
I come from a real family, yeah
Over paper things could get complicated
I come from a real family, yeah yeah
I come from a real family
I come from a real family

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I come from a real family
Been stacking and we still at it
Smoked a half a zip in the benz wagon
Trying not to lose balance
Thankful I made it back to the palace
Roll up another one and pop a lil bottle of sum'
Celebrate every night the money come
And see we party every night we always hustlin'
And see you was sleeping when we turned the oven on
So when we cut the cake don't you be expecting nothin'

[Hook]
I come from a real family
Shit might get crazy if you try to play me
I come from a real family, yeah
For paper things could get complicated
I come from a real family
I come from a real family
Yeah, I come from a real family

[Verse 2]
Work for it dawg ain't nothing handed
If you moved on it by now you probably would have had it
Diamond rings bugs bunny carrots, BBS, Rolexes, mafia status
But you not grinding for it lazy ass you should be embarrassed
Bought the Lamb and the Ferrari
Tryna see which one the fastest
If my brother is around me know its probably a couple of ratchets
I come from a real family
No reality show cameras just real action
Teenagers is really packing and they clapping
And knock you backwards
Cars exchanging fire weaving through inner state traffic
I remember click clacking masses
I was tryna get a ride to my classes
Guns was being brandished scores was being settled
Niggas was scrambling running carrying they homies calling ambulances
They probably get up and take their sweet time to come handle that
Now its retaliation time you planning that
Catch them boys who done that shit
Leave them where they standing at
But that won't bring your mans back
You might feel better for a second but stay focused it ain't over dawg
Karma will try to catch up cycle goes on, street soldiers die
They sons are born into a war and now its time to ride

[Hook]
I come from a real family
Shit might get crazy if you try to play me
I come from a real family
For paper things could get complicated
I come from a real family
I come from a real family
I come from a real family

Money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
When its showtime how many your..
