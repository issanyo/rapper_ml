[Hook]

Boy you getting on my fuckin’ nerves
Better back up off me or we’ll put you in the fuckin’ dirt
Couldn’t see me from a mile away
Cause you know I’m blowin’ up you could of caught me on a wave

[Verse 1]

We runnin’ in to grab the money
Shot em in the face because they lookin’ funny
You know I wish he fuckin’ would
I got some friends that will put em 6 ft under in some wood
Switchin' up the flow now
We dressin' nice and flying with the crows now
I always felt disrespected
But I mind my damn business if this money is collected

[Hook]

Boy you getting on my fuckin’ nerves
Better back up off me or we’ll put you in the fuckin’ dirt
Couldn’t see me from a mile away
Cause you know I’m blowin’ up you could of caught me on a wave

[Verse 2]

We lookin’ fresh on all occasions
We ridin’ with them Spanish girls and some Asians
We only knew them for the night
Better back up off my shoes or there is bound to be a fight
Ridin’ with the fam that’s forever
I’d die for my brother now or if whenever
He got me till the day we die
You know we bought to stack this cash and build our little enterprise

[Hook]

Boy you getting on my fuckin’ nerves
Better back up off me or we’ll put you in the fuckin’ dirt
Couldn’t see me from a mile away
Cause you know I’m blowin’ up you could of caught me on a wave

[Verse 3]

You know you done played yourself
You seen our wrath now I bet you hate yourself
Shouldn’t have talked all that shit
Now we bought to swing some arms and catch some fists
Grief did 10 thousand in a couple days
I been grindin years not a couple days
This music shit is blowin’ up
Fuck the bus bout to buy a couple trucks
Who you thought you was boy?
We on top and never comin’ down boy
And don’t forget the tommy guns
Quote me, WHO THE FUCK YOU THOUGHT I WAS?
You know I’m havin’ fun wit it
You know my bag have a couple guns in it
We laughin' all the way to the fuckin’ bank
Then we robbed that bitch with a couple blanks

[Hook]

Boy you getting on my fuckin’ nerves
Better back up off me or we’ll put you in the fuckin’ dirt
Couldn’t see me from a mile away
Cause you know I’m blowin’ up you could of caught me on a wave
