[Verse 1]
Everyday I'm ballin', so you know I'm scorin'
I feel so important, my pockets enormous
These niggas keep hatin', this is their last warning
Met that girl last night, ooh, fucked her through the morning
I don't know no girl I'm sorry, hangup girl, don't call me
No, no you will not have me caught up all up on Maury (Hello)
Cash shower, make it rain, no game, Atari
Ride me like a Harley, only boy in the party
I was on the phone, yeah with Playboi Carti
Comme des Gar√ßons, (What?)
Hearts all on my cardi' (Swag)
I was in a Lamb', Carti he was in a 'Rari (What? Skrrt)
I'm gon' keep on flexin', you don't like me then I'm sorry (Sorry)
