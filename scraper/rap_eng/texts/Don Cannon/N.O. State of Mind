My New Orleans state of mind
My New Orleans state of mind
My New Orleans state of mind
My New Orleans state of mind

Uh
My New Orleans state of mind
Got me lookin' over my shoulder every time I walk to the ride
We know homicide lurks outside
What's fucked up is sometimes it's an inside job
My New Orleans state of mind be advised
My New Orleans state of mind got me feeling like Nas
When he wrote Hate Me Now
I rise above negativities lighting my sticky trees
Then proceed to live out my dreams
That new Maybach is not make believe
They thought about G's when they constructed these, fit for a King
I drizzled diamonds on that Queen
Topic of discussion even if I'm not on the scene
And that's a good and bad thing in New Orleans
Small city, big dreams
Big misunderstanding over small things

My New Orleans state of mind
My New Orleans state of mind
Got me always getting high to ease my mind, shit
My New Orleans state of mind
Got me drinking thinking bout homies who died
My New Orleans state of mind
Trying not to cry
My New Orleans state of mind
