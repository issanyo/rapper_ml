[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]

Shawty Wanna be Famous
Ass so big, Put her on my A List
And I Land her like Acres, She Next to me like a Neighbor
I Started Down with her Ankles, I Moved up to her Naval
My Next Move is Fatal
One Leg on the Bed, Other on the Table
It’s Going Down like Escalator
Ben Franklin and the Twenty Separate
Trynna Get her Body Naked
Fuck Y'all, No Contraception
Don't Roll Like That
Showing Y'all Suckas
You ain't Never Really Ever Evenn Saw Like That
Ball Like That, Fuck Your Girl
And If the Pussy Good, We at the Mall Like That

[Verse 3: Tyga]

Aaahhhh

Ten Thousand in my Pocket, Right Now , Right Now
Can I Make You a Offer
How Much Gon' Cost Just to Take You Down
I Got it, You Know it
Let Me Cash You Out , Here Hold This
Spit Game So Tight
Think I Wrote This
Baby Lets Move Forward, Get Focused
Don't Tell Your Mama, That You Fucking With a Baller
Already Got all this Gold Shit, Onnn
Trynna be Lowkey
Got Your Favorite Bad Bitch Trynna Blow Me
Roley, Rolex, Relax
Say She Just Gave Me Head, Leaned Over in the Front Seat
Dark Tint, So They Don't See
Get it Off Slowly, High as they Know Me

[Chorus]

I Say What's Up Wit it ?
You Gonna Work Your Body
I'mma Throw Out These Tips
I'mma Make You Somebody
Let Me Call You My Bitch
Let Me Call You my Bitch
Can I Call You my Bitch?
Yea, Yea Yea Yeaaa. (x2)
