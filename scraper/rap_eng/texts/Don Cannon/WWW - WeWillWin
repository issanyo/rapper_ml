Verse 1 :

I'm that new nigga they watch and copy/
Study my every move and run with it then they try to mock me/
Coming in with full pressure who gon try stop me/
The Same niggas i was rooting wanna knock me/

The work done i need more from papi/
Im down to earth but in the booth, they'll tell you different boy I'm sorta cocky/
It's hardtimes but the Lord got me/
2 wishlists i kept one for myself and sent God a copy/

It's a plea not a request Lord answer my prayer/
My mom invested much in me how am i gonna pay her/
My girl left me wasn't sure what i was gonna make her/
So many loses they was calling us arsenal players/

The top gunners in the city is packing the blazers/
Where where you when i was sitting broke asking for favors/
My Skill set wouldn't pay me/
I went to church yes but my religion couldn't save me/

Dropped a song every week but still yet, you wouldn't rate me/
The cops came arrested the homies but couldn't take me/
Can't replace me
Kyrie Irving to the team it's a mistake if niggas trade me whats up/




I see you tryna play me......./

We will win at the end of the day/

Hard for my niggas today but we will win at the end of the day/.....

I know its hard for my niggas today but we will win at the end of the day/

Got bars & im fresh out the south, Lil Boosie/..........
I'm in the game and I can't play fair/
I told him bro I'm from the city, but I can't stay there/
You can see it/

Weak dogs i don't blame him it's the way they was bred/
I was sitting there watching when they made they bread/
