You already know nigga!
(CANNON!)

CHORUS:

"I'm about to fuck they whole summer up, I'm about to fuck they whole summer up,(Yea) I'm about to fuck they whole summer up!!!"

Verse

Stepping out the coupe aura so pimpish
Pockets stay pregnant niggas catching morning sickness
Testimonial swag that these bitches gotta witness
Your money never talk all I hear is fucking crickets
Business
I'm on it check my components
Married to the game niggas hoping for annullments
Involvements
Is Major please watch the gators
I'm a wiz with the work suits stay tailored
Haters
Come frequent because there life ain't decent
Conspiring for my downfall talking at the precent
Speak to my lawyer bitch that shit is just a thesis
Your case is just a snack watch me motherfucker eat this
Jesus
Good you please watch me
The devils trying to box me
He fucking with the wrong nigga, Swag so cocky
Yahtzee yea I'm on a roll
(High Fiveing with God)
I would never sell my soul
Pale Horses shall Behold
A nigga with a attitude valued like gold
Steady checking these hoes
They popping up quick like I'm riding in a Rose
It must be the shoes or the nigga in the clothes
I suppose
You niggas never heard of me yet
Your girl ain't breast feeding but my kids are own her chest
My convo so dry and her pussy wet
I'm all in that box , she'll never see a check nigga

(hahaha yea, yea)

She'll never see a check nigga!!

(yea, yea, yea, Bitch ass nigga what I'm about to do?)

**Chorus***

(Burp!!)
