[Verse 1]
I've been drinking, I'm high, I have a lot to say
I never get so down as when you go away
From the bottom of my heart, from the red of my blood
What I feel is real, baby, I'm in love

[Hook]
I want cha, I need ya
I love ya (On and on and on)
I wanna discuss the future
Can't get enough (On and on and on)
Your body baby, makes me
(On and on and on)
I could go on and on, on and on
About how I feel about you (On and on with you)

[Verse 2]
There's no end in sight
I can't imagine what my life would be like
I wanna talk about the future
From the bottom of my heart, the red of my blood
Baby, I'm in love
(You) Yeah, summertime it's (You)
Oh, winter time and it's you (You) baby, all the time
And you stay on my mind

[Hook] x1.5

[Break]
When I see you wanna pull my skirt up
Got me feeling like I'm 'bout to burn up
Got me feeling high, baby put your hands up
Cause baby, it's a hold-up
So love me, I can make you love me
Always into me
You're what I want, what I need
Love what you're doing to me

[Hook]

[Outro]
Girl, your sight baby
Hit me down, baby all the time
On and on
I wanna talk about the future
All night
