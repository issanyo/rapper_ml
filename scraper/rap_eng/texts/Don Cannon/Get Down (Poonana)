[Verse 1]
When I’m in the spot man they know who I be
Do it cause I love it not for notoriety
Never was a fad shit I’m super sonic
All my bitches bad gotta go exotic
Hard in the paint man I been the wildest
All about the green like I’m on a diet
Nothing funny know the money thicker than Maliah
Man I’m like a stick of dyna—mite baby hype baby never was a liar
I can see the future everything designer
Let me hit the poonana a premadonna
Gotta keep it real with you its a thing of honor 
(bounce)

[Hook]
You gone get searched
Shake that shit, DAMN!

[Verse 2]
Something they could never be
Hot enough to fill the devil up with jealousy
Little model lady you gone be the death of me
Beautiful, personality on Della Reese 
You mean to me, but you love me, love me heavily
Got a nigga out here tryna cuff you like a felony
That divine timing, bring the fine china
Cause eating cat is a delicacy
Seeing through you like when girls use to rock the jellies on their feet
You’ll never wanna leave, atomic dog but I am never on a leash
The flow Mona Lisa go hard my nigga you hear the things she telling me
DAMN!

[Hook]
You gone get searched
Shake that shit, DAMN!

[Verse 3]
Niggas mad cause they ain't hot as befo'
Sleeping on a clown nigga I’m so tired of the jokes
Your lady running to the wood like a knock at the door
Girl you making up your story did you powder your nose
She get dick on the run and I get vagina to go
You can keep the cry from the baby monitor though
I don’t need it, freak if he don’t fuck ya then ya leaving
Believe it, guess the nigga slacking like a deacon
Jumping off the deep end, tell em I’m anemic
Its a cold world when the iron ain't on you can’t reach it
Life decent, her pussy ripe, tighter than lime squeezes she freaky (church)

[Hook]
You gone get searched
Shake that shit, DAMN!
