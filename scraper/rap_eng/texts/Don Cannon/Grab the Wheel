[Verse 1]
I was broke
I was just at home
Now I'm on the road
Talking to Usher at The Grove
Rocking Balmain, these ain't Joe
When I'm in DC they call me Moe
Always got the pedal to the floor
I got everything up in the store

[Hook]
That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no boogie
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't
Looking at that girl and then I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried

[Bridge]
I won't speak
Red bottoms my feet
My bitch on fleek
Lil Uzi a beast yeah!
No more
I don't want to play no more
I don't want to heartbreak no more
I don't want to wait no more
Rocking shows
I might get a lake house with a boat
I might rock all white just like the Pope
I might rock all white just like the stove

[Hook]
That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no boogie
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't
Looking at that girl and then I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried

[Bridge]
I won't speak
Red bottoms my feet
My bitch on fleek
Lil Uzi a beast
No more
I don't want to play no more
I don't want to heartbreak no more
I don't want to wait no more
Rocking shows
I might get a lake house with a boat
I might rock all white just like the Pope
I might rock all white just like the stove

[Verse 2]
I don't know
Look I'm only 21 I don't know
I don't know
You niggas nothing that I know
I was broke
I was just at home
Now I'm on the road
Talking to Usher at the grove
Rocking Balmain these ain't Joe
When I'm in DC they call me Moe
Always got the pedal to the floor
I got everything up in the store

[Hook]
That's just coke up in her nose, that ain't no boogie
Looking at that girl I really shouldn't
Looking at that girl just like I wouldn't
Looking at that girl and then I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie
Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried
All my enemies and my opps they getting buried

[Verse 3]
And I swear it is my time
Make her roll weed all the time
And I mix that lean and that lemon lime
And I swear I won't sweat you that much if you wasn't fine
Then I made you mine
You always think I'm lying
I ain't got time for the lying
Girl give me some time ya
I can change your life ya

[Outro]
I shouldn't
I wouldn't
I took it
Grab the wheel, grab the wheel, grab it like I'm Tuddie

Nowadays I'm getting money I don't worry
All my enemies and my ops they getting buried
All my enemies and my ops they getting buried
