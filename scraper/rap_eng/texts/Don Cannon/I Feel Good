[Intro]
Yeah
2 Chainz
Whip cold, get dough, different flows
I killed the last beat, I'm out on parole
You know the code, point scene, money gone
You know what I'm on, pass the styrofoam

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

[Verse 1]
Hey, motivated, woke up like I'm gonna make it
I had a dream I seen Serena playin' tennis naked
Formulate a plot, conversate with Glocks
Bang bang motherfucker this is gun talk
I got a fresh pair step and get fresh air
Yves St. Laurent spring collect wear, yeah
And I've been on my paper route
A lot of zeros in my motherfuckin' bank account

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

[Verse 2]
One of a kind, Bond Number Nine
Powder on my chest, diamonds on my neck
I drop the work and make it back flip
I'm a walking poster child for Saks Fifth
In the catalog where it say next year
Put my order in this is Corvette gear
In the T top with her knees cocked
I'm so motherfuckin' high nigga tree top

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good

[Verse 3]
I feel good, laid back, feet up
I know my money low, I just re'd up
Got my car, no keys but
Left the Gucci store nigga, all G'd up
Yeah, on to the next one
If you see smoke, that's our section
If you see ho's, that's our selection
At the strip club during a recession

[Hook]
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
Oh I feel good, oh I feel good
