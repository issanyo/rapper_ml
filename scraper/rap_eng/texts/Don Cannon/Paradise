[Hook]
Yeah, Paradise yeah
It's somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no make up
Yeah, Paradise yeah
It's somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no make up

[Verse 1]
Baby you like me, Like the way you stay clean
All this Alexander Wang, all this Alexander McQueen
You doing your little thang', you rocking Balmain
I’m rocking Mr. Completely, the 424 thing
I started touring
My life is the opposite of "my life is oh so boring”
Yeah, you know so turnt up

[Hook]
Yeah, Paradise yeah
Its somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no make up

[Verse 2]
My phone ignoring, when you be calling
I started balling, you stop your stalling
That Range I park it, I drove a Rover
I skrrt I skrrt it, I swerve and drive it just like a stole it
And she right on my side, cause she’s the boldest
Our styles the coldest, styles the coldest
We lip lock until our lips are swollen
Live in the moment, good times is golden
I'm not gonna lie you got me open, Yeah
Yeah, but that's only in the moment

[Hook]
Yeah, Paradise yeah
Its somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no make up

[Outro]
Yeah, Paradise yeah
Its somewhere that I never been before
Yeah, I just wanna be there when I wake up
Yeah, like you better with no make up
