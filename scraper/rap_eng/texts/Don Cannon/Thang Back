[Intro]
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(Oh oh, there goes my clip)
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(best believe I got another one, so don't even trip)

[Verse 1: Willie The Kid]
Bullet shells on the crime scene, it's day time
See the cars with the high beams
Homicide all around trying to find things
Couple clues, hear the news when the 9 beam
You heard me? You better get you a gun
Young niggas saving up, piecing up on one
Have you coughing up blood with a hole in your lung
Fuck around, probably shoot your mom's best friend's son
Where I'm from, it's too small for these all out brawl's
Hoes fighting all the time, titties fall out brawls
And, it's cops everywhere when you step at the mall
Lil niggas got to shooting by the food court
Shooting dice, smoking newports, probably die for your chain
Life is too short
Oh yeah, and, by the way, Gun Rue is the place
Either catch you bullet or catch you a case
But, either way, you know we

[Chorus]
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(Oh oh, there goes my clip)
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(best believe I got another one, so don't even trip)

[Bridge: Willie The Kid]
You know my niggas ain't playing man
And you know, the way this shit is laying man
If you front and think I won't bang that
It's click clack, we cocking that thang back

[Verse 2: Willie The Kid]
They say it's getting worse every summer
Trying to make a name, it's the same new comers
Talking mad shit, but, your gun in the whip
You're parked down the street, plus, your man got the car keys
He said it felt like truck hit him, and every since, when it rains
Say you fuck with him
And, bullets ain't got no name, but
You dumb ass niggas ain't got no aim
And it's small time beef, only bring police
Make it hard for a nigga, trying to cake in these streets
I think it's something in the water or something in the air
Cause these niggas don't care, where I'm from

[Chorus]
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(Oh oh, there goes my clip)
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(best believe I got another one, so don't even trip

[Bridge: Willie The Kid] (2x)
You know my niggas ain't playing man
And you know, the way this shit is laying man
If you front and think I won't bang that
It's click clack, we cocking that thang back


[Chorus]
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(Oh oh, there goes my clip)
Cocking that thang back
Cocking that thang back
(best believe I got another one, so don't even trip
