[Chorus]
Can't talk right now, baby girl I’m high
Bustin' down millions with my guys
Keep them racks on me when I slide
Bad bitch with me, passenger side
VVS diamonds, water my style
20 cameras, surveillance my house
Government pictures, runnin' around
I’m more important than the president now
Why I always give, and don't never want none back? (on God)
Why I'm missin' time with my kids, cause I'm chasin' these stacks
Why did I just go and spend 30,000 at SAKS (on God)
On God

[Verse 1]
He just a drug dealer
He just drug dealer
He just a thug nigga
He just a rich nigga
He just a rich nigga
Quarter mil on the wrist, nigga
We don't do all that click hoppin'
No, I don’t switch niggas
This shit comin’ too fast, uh yeah, new coupe, paper tags
Skipped English class, uh yeah, but went to math, uh yeah
Went bought my sister a Benz (I love you)
Went bought my momma a crib (I love you)
Bought my dad another rollie
Independent but he global
How the fuck did he do it? (trap)
I front a nigga 33 pounds, it ain't no Patrick Ewing
Don’t ask me how I'm doin' (what?)
All this Eliantte on me, nigga you know I'm coolin’
Ain't no money, I ain't movin'

[Chorus]
Can't talk right now, baby girl I'm high
Bustin' down millions with my guys
Keep them racks on me when I slide
Bad bitch with me, passenger side
VVS diamonds, water my style
20 cameras, surveillance my house
Government pictures, runnin' around
I'm more important than the president now
Why I always give, and don't never want none back? (on God)
Why I'm missin' time with my kids, cause I'm chasin' these stacks
Why did I just go and spend 30,000 at SAKS (on God)
On God

[Verse 2]
I pull up on my block, 2 million in cars
Nobody from my side of town ever did this (it's Dolph)
A billion dollars, the only thing on my wish list (it's Dolph!)
Baby, you can kiss my dick cause I don't kiss, bitch (sorry)
My whole click lit (lit!)
My neck frost bit (woah)
If it cost a millions bucks, then it don't cost shit (uh-uh)
I took a college student, turned her to my boss bitch
I been on since 15 years old, ain't no off switch (hah)
All my haters be like "damn, he ain't fell off yet?!" (uh-uh)
CEO shit, ain't nothin' like a Dolph check (it's Dolph!)
Keep it 100, but you keep it 90 percent (what?)
I gotta cut you off, I'm sorry but I'm off that

[Chorus]
Can't talk right now, baby girl I'm high
Bustin' down millions with my guys
Keep them racks on me when I slide
Bad bitch with me, passenger side
VVS diamonds, water my style
20 cameras, surveillance my house
Government pictures, runnin' around
I'm more important than the president now
Why I always give, and don't never want none back? (on God)
Why I'm missin' time with my kids, cause I'm chasin' these stacks
Why did I just go and spend 30,000 at SAKS (on God)
On God
