Yeah, middle of night, Lil Frank is getting some tonight
Two girls kissing yeah, special night I made it yeah
Been to long, never gone broke, SD was long to gone
Gone to long, fan gone cried, mama and dad, proud of me now
If I got someone to love, tell em I'm getting to the end of my trail

Checks rolling in, hitting them folks, live back in the neighborhood
Back to the crib, been a long day, shout out to all my homies!

Looking up, the moon actually shines
