S.A. Smash is hard as hell
Throw your tapes in Garbage Pails
I got a thing for dingbats in garter belts
And Ima talk shit till my tongue starts to swell
Every rhyme I writes post dated
Not to be released this year, most hate it
Nigga, take it back to the basics
4 track tape decks stacked in the basement
Spilling beer when I rhyme
And you learn to appreciate 11 years down the line
We done that dumb rap, some act invincible
Until the gun clap, now they can't come back
That's the breaks, niggas can't bust so they masturbate

[Hook]
First we lay down the law and we (Slide on 'em)
You got the green and yellow ups so (Slide on 'em
I don't know who you are, but we both by the bar
And its almost 3 so can we (Slide on 'em)

A Silly nigga that will cop some brains, pop my chain
And keep the collar popped even when the block look strange
And keep them dollars out, if you wanna rob the king
Cause a rock can keep you roped in like boxing rings
And get your girl before I strip her to her socks and change
And have her averaging them down is like a stock exchange
This is thug business, when I'm in clubs I hug bitches
And when niggas assuming I'm cool I hug pistols
With a thug aim, go to your spot, I let my nuts hang
Having you fiddling through your bus change
And if you don't think we'll jump, we'll blast your porches
Come around and wet your block punk
And splash your Porsche's
Get your ashes imported, you asking for it
High players get dirty players smack you for it

[Hook]

So what the fuck, you wanna pop sickle?
Your pens a feather, mines a sword and it don't tickle
What's up Jack, you talking shit?
It better be quick and better be nimble
On you don't like this, fuck what you say
You can't see Cannibal blade or Smash esse
Computer nerds, life is bigger than iMac
That's why backstage with your girl I mack
Well I thought she was yours but now shes ours
You still leaving messages and sending her flowers
On the pay phone crying you hurt me
You'll feel better with some rum in a Slurpee
You'll feel better with some dro in a dutchie
Nigga, with some dro in a dutchie
This is hard working Harlem, you can't touch me

[Hook]
First we lay down the law and we (Slide on 'em)
You got the white on white ups so (Slide on 'em
I don't know who you are, but we both by the bar
And its almost 3 so can we (Slide on 'em)
First we lay down the law and we (Slide on 'em)
You got the Puerto-Rican ups so (Slide on 'em
I don't know who you are, but we both by the bar
And its almost 3 so can we (Slide on 'em)
