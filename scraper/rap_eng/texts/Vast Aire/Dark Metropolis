[Intro]
Clearly we are cut from a different cloth.... divine garments!

[Verse 1]
My favorite element is the wind
I don't like to brag about slaying the red dragon
The missing tile in the skin was unraveling
He inhaled then I chucked the javelin
My close friends call me Mister Miracle
Cause' I’m the first to escape the dark side of the physical
Prison, this is the birth of the New Gods
You could call us the Crimson
You don't want me to concentrate
Cause' you know I got that juice that a make a planet gravitate
Here's one to investigate
How do I use aerosol cans to make myself levitate
That's my secret identity
My brother is eternity and my sister is infinity
So that means you ain't seeing me
And I just sent my knights out to clear out the whole galaxy

[Chorus x2]
From the New Genesis to the apocalypse (pump ya fist)
(Where we at?) The dark metropolis!

[Verse 2]
The Blackman is God is an understatement
I’m a titan filled with the Holy Ghost when I’m writing
I’m the wisdom of Solomon and Sheba
I’m the green giant that builds with the Keebler
We can soar to the highest aethers
Where Jah will meet ya' and you ain't even have to light the reefer
So where we going, heaven or neither?
I guess we'll find out when we flatline with Kiefer
I’m surrounded by lost toys
I know I can't see your reflection you're probably a lost boy
Blood suckers of the poor lead 'em to hell's door
And the Babylonian whore right there on the floor
Don't make me come after ya'
Cause' I'll put your face on the grill and lean on the spatula
IGC is spectacular
I’m not afraid of Medusa, I just winked back at her

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
When I was born my mother had a joyful pain
As she said my name I took seven steps and proclaimed
The body's the earth the soul is the flame
And the mind is a watery hurricane
We in the phantom zone
An intedimensional vortex where I spit my poems
Some of you dudes are drones
I feel like The Last Starfighter in Attack of the Clones
And I’m ah' let it be known
The original man is older than any dinosaur bone
And you're about to get thrown
I fight like Nubian Moors that pushed back Rome
I’m at ease with it, I breathe with it
I’m the true and living God I don't need 'whip-its'
Here's what you do to achieve it
You get yourself a mothership and put the key in it...
