[Intro]
Res Nullius, Crazeology, yeah
I'm Vast Aire, I'm LIFELong, yo alright come on
Stronghold, Atoms Fam, yeah
Harlem, is it on ?  Queens
Yo Thanos, Italy come on...

[Vast Aire]
I was born out of darkness
My first words, that i said, was let's spark this
I'm sort of a big deal, think about it
The universe is my footstool, think about it (hehe)
And soon you'll be about it
Your mind will ascend and your ass will follow behind it
Physical frame, left you physically maimed
And you don't even know your spiritual name
You are non-existant, my crew is infinite (atoms fam), we go the distance
My style's beyond
I'll cut your leg off, and make you enter a triathlon (yeah)
And if you think you wanna half-step
That'll be your last breath
Write out your last cheque
Your ass can't cash that cheque
Commin out your face, I'mma have to snap your neck

[LIFELong]
Watch your dome bobble like a Bible head
After your neck breaks when I'm fed
You na wan piss off the dread
I'll put foes in tight awkward situations
Flows like a laser show
Light up radio stations
Cats get cut up, slaughtered, split apart. Decapitation
The rap slaughterhouse
And there's only one way in, and no outs
Y'all took the wrong route
Not having second doubts ?
Towel in. Before the start of the bout (ding) :
Sweating all profusely, looking foolish. A pure mockery
Never no stopping me
L.I.F.E.L.O.N.G. Veteran all-city
From NY to Italy, Crazeology, shittin on your committee
From a ... bird's eye view, peeped you
Through the scope out the markview
Trained specialists : Stronghold, Atoms Fam, y'all already know who
