(Yeah)
(What)
(Push Button Objects)
(You know what I'm saying)
(Yo yo, Maintain)
(Ox)
(Akrobatik's the name, c'mon)
(Rec Center forever)
(C'mon, c'mon)

[Maintain:]
I slay you, your whole crew, producer, manager, and A&R
I slay that man over there playing the bass guitar
Used to fuck with a broad that was always claimin' hard
She tried to slay me so I had to dog her like a St. Bernard (what)
Who gives a fuck I slay the stars
I spit a thousand bars a thousand yards
Like I really need a house of card
You down to spar?
I'm down to fight you til the bloody end
Kickin' raps 'til I'm done, fuckin, blackin' out again
See I pull out a pen and slay this whole
Fucking planet on paper
Record it later, press it up then cash it in
I proceed to mentally abuse my pad and pen
Damaging
Anybody challenging
I stand to win
Battle habits, militant bar like Akrobatik
Competition feelin' the [?] even if we don't [have fans?]
Spasmatic, smoking mics like a crack addict
While others get caught up in the hype like bad traffic
Maintain, you know that cat that's first and last at it
Rips the whole scene and leaves feelin' fantastic
Rec Center member
Rhymin' to the neck bender
Beats
You don't know me? Then keep your ear to the streets

[Hook:]
Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Just for that, Maintain [?]

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
PBO and Cannibal Ox never fake shit

I said you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Rappers probably sell they soul to make a rap hit

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
PBO and Cannibal Ox are never fake shit

[Vast Aire:]
You can play my verse backwards and hear a flower growing
Play it forward and all y'all snoring
I spit very well from my well
Keeps pouring so I might as well
Excel and keep soaring
Yo put the blunt in the blue flame, uptown Harlem
Spittin raps and we solve problems
The mind works lyrical but the stomach'll stay starving
I told Akro and Maintain, remain flowing
The outline is kinda hard to sketch
Like a baseball with the sun behind it
That's hard to catch
I'm serious like the answer to HIV
Government made? Possibly maybe
I got a t-shirt, on the front it says "I don't like you"
On the back it says "stop crying"
That was the first thing you saw before you started whining
Approaching the mic like you feared flyin'
You can't fuck with Supreme alphabetter
And PBO's beats is condiments to each letter, like
My mic
Sounds nice
Salt and pepper
I represent Voltron, arm leg leg arm

[Hook:]
Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
PBO and Cannibal Ox never fake shit

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Rappers fronting like they hard but act like Brad Pitt

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Just for that, Maintain [?]

I said you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Rappers probably sell they soul to make a rap hit

[Akrobatik:]
Yo
I push the buttons on the objects of the opposite sex
And leave heads wondering when I'm droppin' shit next
Akrobatik came to bomb it with the prominent tec
Exposure to my music means more than the common effects
The ominous stench of MCs fills my basement
I regenerate 'em and send 'em back as proper replacements
I lace shit
Whether improvised or written down I'm getting down way more than the average bullshittin' clown
Serious about my craft, sweatin' precision
Lyrics inform the world and then return like messenger pigeons
Test this Perceptionist, you'll probably end up dressin' up different
Go corporate instead of hip hop because you no longer live it
(No doubt)
And if this rhyme is feeling tight as a noose to you
It's because I mashed you tough like a crucible
Irreducible
Soul that stands strong in the face of adversity
And hurricanes on heads like Miami University
From the Big East like Masta Ace said
Frontline warrior vs. the night of the living baseheads
Turn you from a crackhead to a Ak-head
Push Button O, rip this blazin' track dead, yo

[Hook:]
I said you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Rappers probably sell they soul to make a rap hit

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Just for that, Maintain [?]

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
PBO and Cannibal Ox never fake shit

Yo, you ain't fly
You talk mad shit
Just for that, Maintain [?]
