[Intro: Vast Aire]
Def Jux, cipher unknown
This is hard right here
Co-Flow what the deal?
This is Brooklyn right here
This on fire right now
This is east, this is west
3rd degree
What

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Yo, I been nice since you had to put your hat in your sleeve
And break arms like Seagal, don't wear your heart on your sleeve
There's two things in life: fact and belief
Yea, and you best to believe, it's a fact I just rolled the leaf
Def Jux don't care about your culture or creed
Or the color you bleed, and it'd be Ox versus aliens
All you see is martians piled up
As the yeast in my b-boy chest rises up
You ain't a convict, you got caught jaywalking
And you don't know the alphabet, but you still talking
Well I got a blade too
And I know it's sharp enough to cut you
They call me Starving Harlem Scissor Tongue, I lick tissue
And pardon me, my lava just spit almost hit you
You know I got lava spit, and got a lot of it
We can call it in the air, this is the rain drop missiles
Heads or tails
The last cat who tried to see me - he now gotta touch braille
Everybody inherit the earth, why not?
We can sell it to the frail, and feed them fairy tales

[Hook: Vordul]
Cannibal O, plus the X
Love to sex microphones, the type of poems
We spit rips through scripts and strips your bones
Yo we sick with poems off the dome
I'm often known, inhaling Newports and eighths
Cause New York is sick, still we walk and spit
Straight off the D.I.C
With these niggas please you freeze in the NYC where everyone...

[Verse 2: Vordul]
Live from the 1-3-5, representing niggas that strive
Straight through hard times trying to survive
Inside New York, the island of crime
Where the most violent of minds, walking these blocks
Stay eyeing on mine, yo my brain sparks like sporting a Glock
I might start firing live, straight off of the top
Cannibal Ox, inspiring minds, flipping on tracks
Spitting these live animal raps
I'm strangling cats, sliding on my side of the map
Thinking he all, you ain't got it like the mighty, matter of fact
You small, claiming you large?
I'm pulling your card, leaving you scarred
Repping tragedy, warfare, but nod yo, this god writes like
Travelled bars adapt to stars and shine to
Rap Allah, yo we crack cigars to get through stress
Pulling on sess, stabbing these birds, loving the sex
Now I'm chilling in front of my rest
Smoking the rent, watching these cops, popping on blocks
Screaming y'all niggas ain't nothing to wet
We trying to gain freedom like a tribe in Tibet
Starving niggas had to still spit it live on the set
Live on the set

How you do it, we stay moving
Through the jungle, ghetto surviving, spitting lines off the D.I.C
How you do it, we stay moving
Through the jungle, ghetto surviving, spitting lines off the D.I.C

[Hook]
