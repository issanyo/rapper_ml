[Intro: ~Vast Aire~]
Deuces wild, I'm callin the shots

[Verse 1: ~Vast Aire~]
You don't wanna wake up
With a horse head at the end of your bed
That shits pathetic
I will bite your face you'll just stand there
Holding your nose crying for antiseptic
You better step quick the crew is LXG
And we are bout it
Kids your mic should be off
If she's feeling me her pants will be off
The cycle of sin is Sampsora
But it's hard to resist the Carmasutra
I treat MCs like Naomi
And hit em in the head with a Molla-Rolla
Just like I told ya
With a sword in my hand I'm like a soldier
But this ain't no game this ain't no scrimmage
Let us make man in our image

[Verse 2: Genesis]
I am what was and shall be again
Full name is Genesis now call me Gen
Foes called me enemy now call me friend
My flow got white supremacists tryna darken their skin
You couldn't call a better man veteran
Who thinks that they can hang with Letterman
But if your gonna bang with me nigga you better win
Caus I'm like predator I want like a competitive skeleton
Still you be hard-pressed like a star dress
To approach this heartless nigga in the darkness
Regardless of your boys and their bullet proof vests
My back was against the wall I fought best
Then I fought stress inside the fortress of solitude
Like Clark Kent in a dark bent
Spent nights like life can't be like this
Like Eddie Cane let it rain on nights like this
Nice pain is he vain
Nope I'm just rich obnoxious bitch
Mad caus I got this gift
My Glock if swift
Just beggin it's loaded with clips
The glow from the wrist
It caught the sun the solar eclipse
In matter of respect, kids nice hand em a check
I get brains on the planes like Hannibal Lec
And I could shoot like Rashid Wilis hand me a tech
My gats too mechanical now watch an animal wreck

[Verse 3: ~Vast Aire~]
This is real hip hop holmes you don't need Sherlock
You could keep your chicken noodle and your soda pop
I see you laughing now but it won't be funny when I spin your top
He tried to say I ain't fly
Come on dude look at the space I occupy
Now that's about six feet
And with my wings spread you better watch my leap
The angelic sorta like Michael
When we fight your gonna get an eyeful
That means we don't give slack
You better leave Gamura and don't look back
Look at your face white like talcum
Because you saw the Phoenix Millennium Flacon
I want peace like the king but my actions are more like Malcolm
And you're asking how come
