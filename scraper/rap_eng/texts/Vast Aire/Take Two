[Verse One - Vast Aire]
Gimme two takes and I'm gone with the wind
I know piranha rap niggas that'll eat you thin
Which means their flow is sin
You better learn how to swim
So chill out Hero
I move my blade like Beatrix Kiddo
With the illest of Haiku riddles
On top of a mountain, playin a fiddle
You don't really wanna dance you just dabble...
Yo...
You are not the better man
Like wacko Jack-O ain't Peter Pan
Actin like you ain't nervous
Now that's a True Lie like Jamie Lee Curtis
You backwards like sock on shoe
Don't let me catch you where they rendezvous
You got you your own shit that means God blessed you
But that means I don't gotta like you!
Son, the God's spit spiteful...
C'mon dude I was born to rap
When delivered I had a rhyme and the doctors clapped
The nurse beatboxed
Harmonizing while the cradle rocked
You got problems let me know
Shit I got your back like C3PO
You thought rap was dead
Nah, you was on Prozac it's all in your head
(It's all in your head...)

[Hook]

So take two of these but don't call me
In the morning cause I'll be snoring
In the city or somewhere touring
Next to a cutie I'm wakin up yawnin
I guess I was blessed with the callin
I keep soaring, you keep falling
And if it was up to me?
We would just all evolve just like Darwin
You need to quit stallin

[Verse Two - Vast Aire]
Sorry kid, you got overpaid
I know some hungry ass cats and they're on their way
We like girls with Oil of Olay
No sausage here we like fish fillet
And I don't need no one behind me
I do my dirt all by my lonely... HOMEY
I used to listen to gangsters with jheri curls
And make cheese sandwiches with no frills
My favorite groups was EPMD
PE on TV? Now thats therapy
I came up in the streets, you came up
In a Smurf village; there is no comparison
And if this was the search for the Holy Grail
You besta believe I'm Harrison
Ford. The whip is the mic cord
With an invisible string if I drop sword
You put that together
We can do this to a beat or go accapella
When I spit these sentences change the weather like...
