[Verse 1: FL]

Milk is chilling
Sco is chilling
What more can i say, we stay killing
That's how we rock, we rock it good
Since you're under wood
Or should I say a rock
Class in session, you should stay and watch
World class with the style, Mister Freedom got it locked
Probably seen me on your block, with the homies, politicking
Making major moves with the family, fuck the opposition
2 blunts in rotation got me lit, I be flying
Could barely keep my eyelids
Open but im trying
Hit me when its daylight, we can get to skyping
Bitches want Face Time, but all they get is stylus
I'm growing hella shining
Focused and I'm grinding
Man I don't even consider the competition minor
Comparing stature of compositions that i be rhyming(s)
Like titan to a tyrant, giant to a lion
Watch me move in for the kill, like a nigga with a license
Checkmate, your bishop and your knight is getting silenced
We doing what we feel, see a spark then we ignite it
Despite the non-believers trying to fight it like....



*Beat change*


[Hook]

"In America Today"
"...America Today"
"In America Today"
"...America Today"



[Verse 2: Vast Aire]

The American way selfish
Where you snatch the pearl out of the shellfish
You wanna play devil, I'm the opposite
When you go kamikaze in the cockpit
My mind splits
Please, let me finish
My thoughts are so distinguished
I'm the cleanest, and the meanest
I got it hemmed up, even though it's seamless
"Star Trek", watch me beam this
Scotty! You need to relax
We got politicians, that'll raise your tax
Then they use money when they smoke crack
Then they use the money, like they use smack
Yo, it ain't all that
This the reality, This is the facts



[Hook]

"In America Today"
"...America Today"
"In America Today"
"...America Today"


"In America Today"
"...America Today"
"In America Today"
"...America Today"
"Today"

[Outro]

"I say to the young folks, you better work like hell to get the capitalist into the rightful position and that is behind the united states constitution, and not in front of it.  Because as long as the capitalist are in front of the united states constitution
That means in america we will always put emphasis on property rights, and there will be no emphasis on human rights.  And this country is not controlled by the united states constitution, this country do not function under the democratic process. This country is controlled and governed by the capitalist"
