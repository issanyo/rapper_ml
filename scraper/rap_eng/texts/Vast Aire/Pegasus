Camouflage!
The shadow!
We in the darkness!
The dragon snatches the pearl!

Hey man, you want a sip?
I got the cup of knowledge
Rinse but don't... spit
Ebonics, burnin, that's the shit
And that girl by the bar with the waistline
Shakin her hips (okay!!)
This is the last crusade, I might
Fix your edge up when I juggle my blade (whoa!)
My hydro's hidden believes
My swordstyle's hidden believes
There's no honor with thieves
That's why you keep that Great Adventure bat up the sleeve
You know the one that fits the forearm
When the 5-0 hit the block, you walk calm
Like "I ain't do it!"
"But you've been cutting school all day!"
You're damn right I'm truant
All emcees repeat after me
Or you can catch a gasface fuckin with V
A-S-T A to the I to the R and the E
So syllable free
Therefore you ain't the King like Coretta
Man, I defeated you with eight letters
So imagine if I formed a sentence
You wouldn't even be here
You'd be past tense
And that's how it goes
"Oh she took all your money?"
Oh that's how she hoes
It started with Eve in the garden
The devil gave her the fruit, cause Adam was starving (haha!)

Even if the steel is stainless
It'll leave shoes shoes bloody if your man is brainless
Don't move, think twice
Count to ten, be nice

Even if the steel is stainless
It'll leave your shoes shoes bloody if your man is brainless
Don't move, think twice
Count to ten, be nice

Symbolizin that the war is won
The Indian chief'll greet the sun
Then bear witness to the dark
Then the tribe'll do the dance of the hawk
When will you learn?
Man I smoke so much you can have my turn
And I rap so much you won't get no burn
"He ice-grillin you son!" I am not concerned
Phoenix wing torch sky that's the purpose (that's the purpose!)
You got a fake smell and you're worthless
When I cut you in the street you'll be nervous
Holdin your cell phone askin for service

Even if the steel is stainless
It'll leave shoes bloody if your man is brainless
Don't move, think twice
Count to ten, be nice

Even if the steel is stainless
It'll leave your shoes shoes bloody if your man is brainless
Don't move, think twice
Count to ten, be nice

Superhero mutherfuckers is it Lois?
It's funny how they brought Trinity back like Lois
I guess Clark and Neo wasn't havin that
I know you want world peace
Well peace is where the titties at
Uh huh, I know you might like it
But the majority rules, and I think they like it
Yeeeah, plus I'm good with the girls
I tell em when they like me and they call me psychic
Yeeeah, no love for dumb chicks
How you gonna be my sidekick, dizzy and shit?
Can't be my Suzuki, save it for show
You're the neighborhood garden tool
And everybody knows ("I ain't no ho!")
That Aire got flows, niggas'll
Bite styles til they got no soul
Niggas'll think they smoking til they like the dro
How we gonna break bread if you don't show me the dough?
