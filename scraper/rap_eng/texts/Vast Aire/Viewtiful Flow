Look mom no hands!
Look mom no hands!

I think I'm going to Disney World after this one

I got the style that amazes
Too many phrases
You think I'm weeded up, I'm on lasers

Huh yeah Cannibal Ox yo!
** You gets no love from me **
There's two things you should know
I had a ill life so I gotta ill flow
But you already knew that
Like the third movie of the Matrix was gonna be whack
Well it ain't like I didn't care
But the Oracle said, "spend your money elsewhere."
Walk with my like one third of a rocks
But talk to me like on half of an ox
Wearin the same clothes In a vein cold
Poppa was a rollin stone
Wherever he laid his hat it became his home
Moms was coked up it became the poem (ouch)
Give me two strikes and I'm gone with the wind
I know piranha rap niggas that'd eat you thin
And all I gotta say is when because..
** You gets no love from me **
You can throw me out the window and I'll land on my feet
If she steppin with me then we keep it discreet
** You gets no love from me **
You could toss me out the window and I'll land on my feet

I'll hit you with the divine secrets of ya! ya!
Coming through with the rah rah
Bumpin cats while they rollin up they la la
This is that backyard boogie
I'll be at the podium and niggas wanna chew me?
I'll be at the cipher, nigga salute me
I'm fly like Woodstock you crawl like Snoopy
I been doing this since 10 years old
And ever since then you wouldn't leave me alone
Talk to the machine when I'm home on the bone
Cause she caught my first album and digs my cologne
Give me two takes and I'm gone with the wind

Ok, 28 grams in an ounce
That means... I can get my mom a new blouse
And that means... I can get my girl a new house
You could die like a rat get trapped like a mouse
Ok there's 16 ounces in a pound
So that means.. You ain't gonna make it uptown
And that means.. the Brooklyn boys'll bang you
And hang you like the Klu Klux and leave 'em with no nuts
I guess that's go fish
I'm swimmin upstream you goin with the current
That's why I'm at peace in life and I do what I do
And you do what's current
Shit, who broke the street to your radio?
Now you coming out of your mouth
But I'm on the white faces just as soon as they pout
And walk on water just as soon as they doubt nigga
I'm here to change the level to boom
If you didn't sell records you ain't packin the room
So this means you should rhyme first
Until you pay your dues rap hurts
