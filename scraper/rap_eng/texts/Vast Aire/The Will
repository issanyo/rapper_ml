What do you believe in
Heaven or hell
We lost touch with paradise
That they man fell
Thats why my rhymes excel
I'm just trying to reach back, I'm just dying for contact
Like Jodi Foster, I'll be in harlem street projects named Foster
You can see and OG and get an oz but it'll cost ya
Harlem the BK streets, scorture
Thats like somebodies torture
And pour Gasoline on first now that's torture
Ima do what I'm supposed to
And after this track nobody will like you
This is my culture, Thats why you see me chillin' with a redbone on my sofa
I'm Vaist Aire, I tour the world, I'll be in london
Backstage with your girl
