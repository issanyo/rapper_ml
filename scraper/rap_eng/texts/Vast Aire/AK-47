[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
Spitamat
For the upper side of the map
And the fact that it sucks to feel whack
Niggas rather get dope and sell crack
Stressed out
Inhale packs as it sells to blacks
And love feeling left out knowing jails is packed
We'd rather be free on blocks with drugs (drugs)
And everybody swear they Swahili blood (uh)
Not really knowing what's going on across boards
Piles of bodies from wars
Got even those that put trust in the lord
Holding they sword
Ready to organize and bust at the law
And say we doing it just for the cause
Cause we tired of living trapped behind walls
We'd rather be outside watching the stars
Fuck living trapped behind bars
We gotta escape
Blocks hot as Mars

[Hook]
Know your 47 ways to swing a AK (K)
Drop ten 10 grenades ('nades)
Sing serenades
We in the streets (what nigga) swinging blades
We in the streets (ha ha) spitting blades

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
I wrote the meanest
Order of the Phoenix
Baptized in fire
Swinging my wings in dirty elevators
Floor got piss
When I got stuck on the 9th floor
I got pissed
Cannibal O handle you slow like
He don't got no soul no more (psyche)
Man I hit you with the ashy knuckle
First your brain'll freeze then your legs'll buckle (woo)
You don't want no problems niggas
Cause we aim planes like them Osama niggas
Kamikaze, you ain't the first
Man I'll be in a canopy singing a poem
Money is raw, money is war
My president is wearing a red tie
That means you and your family's bout to cry
But push the panic button, we all gonna die

[Hook]
Know your 47 ways to swing a AK (K)

We in the streets (ha ha) spitting blades

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
You can swing with all your might
And I'll parry your strikes
Aiki-jujitsu, centerized swipes
My family is Spitamatic
And all these grimy streets know we laugh at addicts
You a rookie I'm a Def Jukie
(Shit) What is you son, a muffin or a tough cookie?
The beat loops then we summon the troops (c'mon)
Black hawk down, Vordul's in the parachute

[Verse 4: Vordul Mega]
Like no matter the pain
We gotta get high to the rain
Or fire blocks red with sirens
Gets his only peace through silence
Where militants got a piece of metal object
That'll blow away houses
We over here talk about get on some bounce shit
With a military presence and trained systems
Fearing exploding garbages
Kinda hard to be positive
But it's like we gotta live

[Hook]
Know your 47 ways to swing a AK (K)
Drop ten 10 grenades ('nades)
Sing serenades
We in the streets (what nigga) swinging blades
We in the streets (ha ha) spitting blades
