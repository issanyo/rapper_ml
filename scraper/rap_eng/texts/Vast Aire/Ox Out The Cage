[Intro: El-P]
1 2
Ladies and gentlemen
I would like to take the time to introduce to you
A group of very talented young and yet (cannibals)
Bloody and violent individuals (running down your area)
People who are bound to eat your children in a fit of rage
And then smile in your face

[Verse 1: El-P]
Cipher unknown, phone home
From boom box nationals
Scratch demonstrator attach that to dedicate
This involves all total all city caught up
Caught up all city kid nurtured in the game understands
In a place where you live
In demand a saturated burn mega radio dyed eccentric kid
Add a frequency to sifted intelligent biped lid
To combine rent
I sent them

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
You want to pop shit and get popped in the top lip?
I shoot the five and on a good day I bite bullets
We use bear traps to catch weasels
Metal mouth's diesel and the bite's lethal
We in the catacomb, nappy headed never used a comb
And built with the forces that blew away Dorothy's home
I grab the mic like, "Are you experienced?"
But I don't play the guitar, I play my cadence
And if I exhaled arguments only to hold my breath
I would die, and I ain't talking hair color
I'm talking about the reality with my mother's eye water
The author with a Papermate
Spitting paperweights

[Verse 3: El-P]
Whether trapped in a government-funded box or free range
A .22 nicotine patch automatic sedate
When it comes to ?
? residence
Residents, I be NYC

[Verse 4: Vast Aire]
Now this environment's a product of me
Function sloppy identity copied
With a rhyme scheme so ill we change rap to con artists
I'm honest to a fault and it's my fault I'm that honest
I guess it's the dimension I climb out
And flow like arachnids on water spouts
The circle is never seen and seldomly heard about
They put me in a cage and Mega will break me out

[Verse 5: Vordul Megalah]
Broke out the cage and blazed an ice cold bowl of sage
Patrolling the maze with four Os and blades
Spit flows straight off corn rows and braids
Light bones and strike domes with
Words I spray automatic vinyl accapell
Separate your soul from the shell
Trapped in the belly
Find me spitting these raps on the celly
That's Mega popping as-salaam lecture
Send a message for those starving in the Mecca
Cooking up measures, stressing the po
Mixed in the vein cold trying to escape
As the pain grows with insane flows
Fit for those wanting to oppose copyright division
Leave you leaking on a stretcher
Puffin on the o, pop you with a biscuit
Fucking with the o plus the x
Bust with effects head blow
Shine these cats divine spit with lines
That go straight through spines
Witness animals robbing armored trucks
And escape with nines
Cause tragedies, crack clavicles, rap classical
We're at 7th Avenue, New York, the city of crime
In the city sublime
Wrapped in subliminal thoughts of criminal ways
While critical times got my mind locked in a physical maze
Trapped in another noose guzzling two Kahluas
Pop through your bubble goose with raps (takes time)
Pissy, still this all day flow mic jiggy
Rep that NY City, trapped in the shitty, we gets busy
On Mike Nitty, stay twizzy, wrap phillies
And crack dutches, live in the rap function
Flows often bananas off the nut crunches
Salute profanity with middle finger fuckers
Live for you duckers, suckers

I don't have an end piece
That's hot (El-P)
