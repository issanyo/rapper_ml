[Hook: repeat 2X]
The same motion, that moves the hip
Has the same efect on dominoes when tipped
I got two forty-five cents embedded
And I won't hesitate to leave your crew shredded

[Verse]
The name, is Vas Kramer
We been rhymin' since playn' hopscotch on top of the earth's surface
If you can't perform a sentence you're worthless
Put your hands up in the back, if you heard this
Yo hipster throw a scratch
To cover my phsyical you need six feet of tape like IMAX
So you can get the clear picture
I'm old school with new thoughts and open wounds, pour salt!
Can Ox is dirtier than a mudslide
And if you get caught, you might die
Let's let the sky decide
The speed is still right
After the Titans colide
Freestyles caught in my head
Starch in my head
Leave you with shreds
You wanna contest a dread
It's magnetic
Like live poets metal hands on top of my nuts that's pathetic
If you heard it, then I said it
When it rains it pours don't wet it
Man, you know what I'm saying?

[Hook]

[Verse]
There's only a billion prophocies, one of them's gotta set it
And only two MC's, and one of them's beheaded
Now you leaving the cypher retarded
As if you got caught, it's something you started
Clean this shit up! Like whatchamacallit
I see the sea just parted
And Air Vast just called it
Man, you ain't half as tight
I can bend any substance, that's metal nightlight
I can break any rule that's slavery type
I'm awful, we take no shit, that's the form we like
Adam's fam
You wanna fight styles, we got t-shirts that say we cut hands
Son we'll take both of 'em, the first time
So you can't play even play the wind chime
Or the piano, jazz or classical
I'm Vast Aire I might rip out your clavicle
Psh, then it's over
It's like that, I'm in the air, with Jehovah
Or in a, Range Rover
Or maybe in the sky holding onto the tail of a star nova
Crazy? I breathe on the mic if you lazy
