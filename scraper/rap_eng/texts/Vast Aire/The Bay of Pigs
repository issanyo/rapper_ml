[Intro: Del tha Funkee Homosapien from Deltron 3030]
This is Sir DZL the people's choice with the deepest voice
In here my boy Big Virt - Virtuoso, and Vast Aire
[Virtuoso:] Vast Aire, Virtuoso
[Del:] The Bay of pigs, where you weak MC's get slayed, you dig?
[Virtuoso:] Big Bang Records, The Final Conflict

[Verse 1: Virtuoso]
The flows leavin em baptized, with a cracked skull and black eyes
Dark shade flying through the sky like magpies
Body in a ditch with the maggots and black flies
Family at the funeral with suits and black ties
Your soul's chastised, just a dark spot on the sun
When I'm talking in tongues, I'm watching em run
Like I was cocking a gun, the prophet has come
Predicted doom in a tomb, leave your oculars hung from a fishhook
So you could see how sharp Virt's brain is
Sperm spawn galaxies, planets drop from Virt's anus
I burn angels in a brimstone in Hades kitchen
Vocal bangers leavin smoke in chambers like .380's spittin
I'm slayin kids like the bay of pigs, find out where them haters live
Break their ribs, nobody is saying shit
Turn gods to atheists they losin' self confidence
No deity seein me, my music's so dominant

[Refrain: Pidi T]
The streets is my playground
Lay down if you think about fucking with me
Cause police don't play around
Because I'm me, makes me wonder if it might be me

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
Let's get it started
I'm running a marathon tonight if you wanna act retarded
We in the Bay where the pigs lay
And I'm the farmer, so you better do as I say
I'm crazy like Eddy
I wrote your book of sex and my favorite page is Benny
Leaving your face envy, to black and blue
You crossover then we laugh at you
You wanna touch but the flow's intangible
I mastered the square and I know how the rap can tangle
Never class with him, attack with angles
These hands love to strangle
And my crew will always come through
All I gotta do is blow the whistle
You better know ninjutsu
Cause I know you better disappear before I hit you
Drop a smoke bomb all of the sudden
After I rap, you're gonna lose an arm length or something
You're whole style's irrelevant
I'll crack your wig and leave you like the hair club president

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Del]
Del is a carnivore, more than just kinda raw
Keeping the line or draw, looking through the eye of war
Fuck who your idols are, why y'all trying hard?
Energy misused, mine's government issued
Missiles countering, peep how loud it ring
Sorta like freedom but eatin through demons
The people be screaming the lyrics be reaming
A non-believing
A
Simplify, sent to strife, with endless ties
Positive pristine, causing a twisting
Tornado flipping fools who keep riffing
Me and the Virtuos, words we serve each oths
Impact sure to crush, virtuze who murderous
Vast the air you breath, ask if they scared of me
They gon say yeah they be while laughing me merrily
No matter where they go, got em on periscope
All the way to [?] to tear through their bear coat
They'll be like "Where we go?"
Carry it with a blanket, ate like a [?]
[?]

[Refrain]
