What's the deal y'all
We about to take you on a pilgrimage

Check one two
Cannibal Ox Asidanation collaboration
Bring that mic down son
That's the lab yo
V-o-r-d-u-l V-a-s-t
Angels and insects

[Kasm]
Inhale into my lungs and straight into my bloodstream
Iron skin stays lean
I roll where the kids scream
Like a figment from the Son of Sam's imagination
With the appearance to catch a schizophrenic fascination
I still talk to you if you's a out patient
Little kid out chasin'
So plow formation
Then from out the mist emerges an eclipse
With a metallic purple glow like the one around my wing tips
Hold your eyes to it bold it ain't confusion
And the light binds to your eyes like molecules infusin'
Like two jazz musicians trying to stare at the sun longer
As is that contest might prove that one of them was stronger
Our perfect speaker formed in god's beaker
Shipped straight out the lab in protection of the weaker
Species on earth I watch over you at birth
And if you stray from the path find my contents in the dirt
Insects wing broken like those men like Ronin
Who have lost their allegiance
That is for whom this poem is spoken

[Vordul Mega]
Trapped in the tunnels of hell
In a catacomb I dwell
Inhale the green leaf
The one who lives in structured homes
Inside trees
Frozen from the life we lead
I cry the streets
Might just bleed
While righteous seeds
Plants and earth
Now life may breed
But ants that work
Carrying weight
Pushin those things to the hypest fiends
Get trapped and caught in the worst sniper's dream
Yo I meditate and let my ghost exit shell
But sometimes its hard when bit by the angel that fell
And tho the sun as it rides through many eyes
You fly niggas my double XL rhymes
Drop and crack shells
Beetle niggas get mad first
Claiming your shell is hard
With mad thirst grabbing the mic with no rhymes
Yo I push spines through dirt
Now tell me what life's worth
To an insect that must invent
What's the reason to live
In a span of three days
While man keeps us trapped behind webs
Trying to take freedom
Shit they might try to take our life like the spider breathin'

[Vast Aire]
Angels and insects
I drag claustrophobic frequencies
From the hollow hole of a murky mole's home
Only to watch drones prepare
To groom hands for their queen with honeycomb
May your name be praised if you fight the gnomes
Who walk amongst us through there innocent
Crushing our exoskeleton domes and abdomens
I know Kasm phonetically moves his wings to recite poems
Quietly a mantis prays
Waiting for his prey to creep
From behind a leaf
Brief messages are sent from the center of a web
Alarming cryptic long legs
It's time to dine
On a fly
That thought he was fly
But never thought death could come from beautiful silk patterns
Roaches help me write rhymes
Yeah thats the joint
But I still make emcees say inhale that when I drop lines
And all that gangster maggot shit
Thats puberty created by society to keep you in one place
That is why I sit in my cocoon and bloom
Reach other things
Like outer space
But you don't even got to go that far
Just look in the nearest ant hill and then the farthest star
Then maybe by then you'll be ready an Atoms rhyme bar
What?
Angels nigga
And when I'm dead and gone
My offspring will live on
Being immune to every lie that belongs to the leg of the centipede
Society
A compound eye
Self sufficient slave to greed
Angels and insects
