When my tongue gets wet
I ride my bike next to the moon so you can envision my silhouette
Yeah, I can hand out peace signs or black eyes with the same hand
And you’re gonna get one of them
It’s up to you to choose
The coin flips
I deal the hand that was granted
How can life be worth nothing after it’s planted?
He attacked the Atom?
I saw he was new to this
Swingin’ at my man but got trapped in a vast nucleus
Who are those who freeze flows
‘Cause they heard water expands when it’s cold
Watch us melt from our molds
The brain-child? Perhaps
After I lost my concentration in the play-pen
The marbles collapsed
So then that’s when I
Sauntered to the Lost and Found of hip-hop
And that’s where my
First mic was found
But then I found, a lot of genetic make-up clowns
Who pushed buttons to create
Fischer-Price sounds
After school I broke graham crackers on the dotted line
With my mind
You can’t compare that to the actions of kindergarten kind

My tongue has a mind
(Similar to mine)
Together (we find)
Parallel lines
(To fall in sync)
While you babble shit
(These battle ships)
Create your demise
(To fall and sink)


[Cryptic One]
Who wants a piece of this master?
My masterpiece release disaster to the masses
Sometime directly after
It emerged fully bloomed
From the depths of a cocoon
My reflection change the direction of my mood to spell doom
For contenders that come tender
I’m tendin’ to tear tendons and car notes
Carcasses, carrying coffee-colored coffins
In their wake
Never to awake
You all suffer the same fate for your treason
My style you better believe in
You better believe that you’ll be leaving, wheezin’
Breathin’ uneven, needing’ medical assistance
It’s no resistance
Intellectual persistence
When I kick this, better keep your distance
‘Cause Cryptic One rips the sun
Out of center of solar systems
Now those false things goes for shine
Perhaps I’ll sell you lights
If your mic device contains some cellulite
Through fat rhymes
But I am sensin’, you senseless or anorexics
Better exit quick
Consume, my sound
They exhume, from the ground
To consume, all around
With a mushroom cloud
And there’s not much room around for you to hide
My sound falls down your ear canal

My tongue has a mind

Time to let these beautiful Japanimated archangel wings
Spring from the backplate for chosen aviation
Vordul keeps it tight
Similar to proletarian living situation
You’re living a situation in trigger freeze
I live life when the drum’s on
So come on, nigga, please!
With that I catch bullets in the teeth
While I spit lasers
Detective gear you wear is obsolete
These words still graze ya
My poetic bars is held within the arms of robotic palms
Waitin’ to set it off
Vietnam
Nah mean?
While apathetic nerds spit destruction theory
I join only to coin my invention of Marilyn Manson cancer spreading Twelve monkey perspective
Now everybody fears me
There be those that walk as MC
Incorporating hooks with horrible R&B
Singers?
I reply with dirty body-mechanic language
Showing my toilet finger
‘Cause I chose to write and hold the mic
Connected to psyche
Dangerous!
Like government prototype
Missile-launching cannon in the hands of starvin’ Happy Harlem
Mikey!
Shit…

[Vast Aire]
Listen…
I ain’t superstitious, but these niggas is NICE!
