(Intro)
(Yo son, Willie Dynamite said 'He wanna hit you son')
(What you gon' do?)
Oh nah, he don't want it with me
Oh nah, shit, I'll bring the Earth, Wind & the Fire
(Word!?!)
When God made rap, he came to me
He said 'What you wanna do?'
I said do this!

[Vast Aire]
This ain't Parker Lewis but you gon' lose
Cuz I can do karate in platform shoes
Hold your breath till your face turns blue
I'm like Dolemite mixed with Doctor Who
With a little bit of Sonny Chiba
I like to smoke cheeba and keep a fly bird
Then I tie my sneaker
You need to keep ya mouth zipped
If this was pre-school, I got the Cheese Nips
I seen Popeye get done in (Uh-huh)
Survival of the fittest, we will eat yo spinach
I think Olive Oyl tried to mix in
Her ass got broke cuz she was too thin
Did she have a chance? I don't think so
Call Pink Panther - Inspector Clouseau
Let's get 'em for info, see what he knows
And watch the face of grown Pinocchio

[Interlude]
No'm'sain, so I ran up there, we hopped in the car
It was like six of us deep, we wasn't having it
I went straight to that nigga's club
I was like yup...

[Vast Aire]
Hell up in Harlem uptown Saturday night
Foxy Brown and Claudine had a fight
And even though it was awful
It got a little worse once they jumped Sparkle
Black Caesar fell out the wagon
But he can switch his hand like Enter the Dragon
Superfly running shit like a gentleman
Cleopatra Jones smacked Lady Heroin
Bad Ass got mad cuz he lost his hat
That dude's a bad mutha - stop that!
He smacked a girl
Back flipped her, rocked her world
And then he went for Cornbread Earl
He choked him out, had him in a headlock
We was like 'What Judo does he got?'
You know my style is Bulletproof
Like Clark Kent when he slips out of the phone booth

[Interlude]
Yo it was crazy dawg, yo chairs was thrown everywhere
Tables was flipping, I was like let's get the hell out of here
Let's go home

[Vast Aire]
We had to bounce - we did the Hollywood Shuffle
I kissed my girl; she was like 'I love you'
Hopped out the car
Checking my body for scars
That's when me and my brother saw the Drug Czar
It was Willie Dynamite
He just left the fight
He was like 'It wasn't me, I was here all night'
Then he pulled out, and he shot my brother
Hopped in the car, 'I'm gonna get you suckers!'
