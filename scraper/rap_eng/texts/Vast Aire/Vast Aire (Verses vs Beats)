[Intro: Vast Aire]
Yo, yo.  It’s Vast Aire, Def Jux, CP Records, Atoms Fam forever.  Come on.  My nigga Blowout like this.  Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Ayyo, my Oxcutter 900 number is unlisted
Holding a golden mic the full-life size of a midget
Sky’s the limit.  The ground’s the bottom
Raps?  I got ‘em and had ‘em since Sodom had salt pillars
You knew the ledge and still fell off the cliff
My old English is brewed from thought—you could taste the difference
I’m stir-crazy with Genes in me that make
Me Wilder than Richard Pryor prior to disease
Nigga, please.  This is the Synapse Olympics
You’re dealing with a gold medalist, higher science
Do a quantum leap over the track in a single bound
And singlehandedly arm-wrestle the sound
Just as sure as I wrote rhyme bars
Drinking out of mayonnaise jars, some of my crew got keloid
Scars on their face like barcode (Barcode)
Last emcee sold to that man in a shiny jacket
Atoms Fam broke the mold to widen the brackets
Open your mind and the acid follow (Follow)
Open your chest.  It might be hollow (Hollow)
When Vast Aire freestyle, no tomorrow
Our national monuments
Covered in sand.  I’ll hold planets in hand like
That’s it.  You figure that out, aight?
