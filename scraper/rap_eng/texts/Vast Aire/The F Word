[Intro: Vast Aire]
It's like, I care about you
I think about you all the time
It's like, we friends and shit
Which means we treat each other right
You'll be there for me when you gonna be there for me

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
Yo, it wasn't even like that
I wanted my cardiovascular to fight back
Cupid had me runnin' circles blindfolded
In the daytime
With a flashlight looking for her
Yo, sit back, relax and smell the roses
A fly girl by any other name would still be that
But the trick is to see that
I'm caught in between future's fantasies
And memories I played back
Told my man I started sword fightin'
Cause fencin' was similar to tongue kissing
If you wait too long you gonna end up confessin'
All I think about is you undressin'
I extended my thoughts in a relationship
But they sunk like the Titanic relation-ships
She was in a love triangle
But it wasn't like my feelings weren't there to make it a square
Pennies for her thoughts
She's my very own American Beauty
Red petals when we talk
...the f word

[Hook 1: Vordul Megalah]
She like music, got me heavily buddha'd
When I'm out with her, feelings be mixin'
Chemical elixirs, caught her like a sickness
And can't get rid of it, these sexual addictions

[Hook 2]
Tangled within in my opposite sex friendships
With too many emotions, got me bent up
And it's real ill when something going on
But nothings being said trying to figure it out
Wrapped all in your head just spit it out and I'll
Truly understand what the problem is
Cause you got me twisted, tryin' to stress birds
Kickin' that f word
Fuckin around, flirtin' and stressin' my nerves

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
Check this situation, I wore my lust like cologne
She called it Obsession
The background's black and white and we adolescents
Like what the fuck we know about love?
The more I learn, it's like the Clash of the Titans
All I wanna do is avoid fightin'
A little arguing's okay but not everyday
And if we can't communicate what we got decays
Until the smell gets more pungent
To the point where we can't be seen in public
Body parts fallin' apart, a symbol of what things do
Or better yet, a symbol of what friends do, they die
And together forever just sounds fly
That's how it sounded to me when I heard it
And slow motion was her lips as she worded
The f word
"Don't take it personal
I like you a lot but I don't wanna lose what we got"
But what we got now is friction
She tellin' me intimacy and friendship - she ain't mixin'
The f word

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
Yo, you burnin' the candle at both ends
I'm supposed to be the friend
I'm gettin' fried in the end
The big bang theory, what is this a trend?
You ask a girl out and the universe extends?
Tell me to talk to the hand again and I'll read your palm
Smellin' your shit now, don't know how to call
All I wanted was grounds for understanding
I ain't greedy, but to hold your heart I gotta put my hand in
Why debate?
You think you can fit me in that anorexic space between love and hate?
I got all of the first one and none of the other
And that's something I learned from my sister and my mother
Thought we was close in the genesis before all this
Technology was cordless, a senseless courtship
This is more than just a song, and when he's treating you wrong
I'm more than just a shoulder to cry on
The F word

[Hook 1 and 2]
