Put on that other beat, yo
You know, the one that's kinda slow, like
The day is long when you're poor
When you're a poor person, 24 hours is like 10 years
And, and, that's a long day
That's seven long days in a week if you're poor
I know some people who came up in slums, I didn't come up in any slums
When things are right, you're not thinking about time
Time is leaving you, time is just... You have a basic day
It could've been nothing but pleasant thought and like relaxation
But you're stressed, because you have a light bill, you know that decent, average New York ghetto
