...And I'm Uptown's finest, you rewind this IGC is behind this!

[Verse 1]
I'm Victory Allah Self Square
I am the remainder when everything else disappears!
I'm the Avatar the Last Airbender (Airbender)
Master of the elements is here
And my tribe has no fears
We ride rhinos bareback and chuck spears! (hold up)
This year we gonna make bucks
See me swimming through coins with Scrooge McDuck
All forces united in one
You see God through the Father and I am the Son
Look at the black prism
If my mother didn't give birth to light, you would have no vision
And I'm Uptown's finest
Royalty, you should call me your highness
Cannibal O (O) handle you slow
We got that black pepper for your sinus

[Chorus]
We got that black pepper for your sinus!
(Cannibal O handle you slow)
...And I'm Uptown's finest, you rewind this IGC is behind this!

[Verse 2]
"Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the dopest of us all?"
Vast Aire! And your style is so last year
Reappear like Nightcrawler mist in the air (mist in the air)
And if you dare hip hop's here
I still love her can't wait to get a whiff of her hair
The messiah is here and it's clear
Put the sword down I'll replace your fears
I'm a respectable man try not to swear
And when the ancestors speak you lend them your ear
And don't judge
Cause every man that strayed from righteousness still needs peers
It's true I'm just giving you hope
You was dying I'm just cutting the rope
You can't come around these parts
Unless you got heart, but you can not cope

[Chorus]
