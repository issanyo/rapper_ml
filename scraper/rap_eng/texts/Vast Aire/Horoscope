[Verse 1]
I see through confusion like the eyes of Heru
Descended like Dante to come out like Jesus
We in the ninth ring, how exciting
I'm King Indra I slay demons with lightning
Black ether though your speaker
If you find a planet that's useful then keep her
Her mind is a reflection of my fire
And her body is 3/4ths of water
She's my cosmic order
She's my mother, my wife, sister and daughter
And our love is timeless
Just like Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist
Wow, isn't life great
She fell for me after she heard my mixtape
She would use music to escape
Press play close her eyes and dreamscape
And isn't that foul
Everybody with a asshole thinks they can rap now
That's not logical how?
You can't get chocolate milk from a brown cow

[Verse 2]
Maybe she's perfect that's what it seems
Maybe she was born with it, maybe its Maybelline
And I wouldn't put nothing past her
I got nothing but love for my Noxzema... Girl
And I'mma rock her world
Duro on the bed and make her feet curl
Shorty had the strawberry shortcake
And I came through with the banana nut swirl
And we mixed them both I hope she heard
What I said when I read her our horoscopes
It was pretty clear like a kaleidoscope
That we were soulmates, that time eloped
I usually don't kiss and tell
Cuz I'm the frog prince by the wishing well
Why is there so much hate? Wish me well
When I look in her face my heart excels
I love her exhale when she pulls my lapel
I'm ready to rock them bells
Scratching on her thigh looking in her eye
She's ready to get impaled

[Verse 3]
It's gonna get wet in the final hour
Cuz I rain down like a meteor shower
She said, "Boy you make my love come down"
I said, "I know when I'm under you I drown"
Check the vibe when she's next to me
We be rubbing each other like ecstasy
With no X in me cuz I don't dig designers
Unless it's Mecca 13, Eddie Bauer
Brainstormin' keep pourin'
I'm ready to rush the store for Ralph Lauren
I get a sugar rush when I hear her callin'
Some say cloud 9, free fallin'
Life is great when you manifest destiny that's your fate
Romeo and Juliet phillies might hate
Life is too short why should we wait?
We go together like sweet and sour
The sky and the ground bees and flowers
This is not for the weak so leave cowards
The sun and the moon have attracting powers
