[Verse 1: Sadat X]
My lawyer, he acting like my employer, he a monster
Not right 'cause he's my sponsor on this eight month scheme
I'm not afraid of the bid, no, not in the least
Maybe it bring my conscience some peace, fuck that
I almost caught a body, bring out the animal
The manimal, the demon, everybody do a little scheming
Won't get no ass for a while and that'll bring out the beast
Fuck New York police, and Pataki, suck a dick
Nigga you caught with two guns and the charges don't stick?
But on Sadat X she wanna be strict
Now I ain't mad at the judge, but the DA wouldn't budge
Holding a personal grudge, she fresh out of law school
She a fresh face trying to build up a case load
But the monster in me is gonna explode, that's right
'till I'm home it ain't gonna be safe that night, get to that
Sadat X, don't worry about the guard, I'll be back

[Chorus: Vast Aire]
It's what
Your life, get hype if you with me
Don't rush
You fight, too much time for remedies
You bust back, fight
Alright, take what's given
Anybody, anything, could be a monster

[Verse 2: C-Rayz Walz]
Actual fact: that what you seen and heard mostly is loud mouths
So where the toast be, when I approach hounds get ghostly
Beats get furry when the beast get hurry, clips spit flurry
That's what's happening now, you ain't gotta ask surely Shirley
In the wild, wild west bring your wild style vest
And bring out the thing with a quiet loudness
Make a lady put her baby in the toilet, just respected
She's an arsonist, she's connected, that line, I can't call it
My conscious is camouflaged conjure, anonymous armor
Brought to you by drama, sponsored by karma
Just a day in the life of a man named "your honor"
Big fish, little pond, little blue suit piranhas
Who shoot the martyr, "poof", troop marauders
Evidence is kept in the closet with all the other monsters
We pay taxes, pay dues, the trumpet plays the part
And now [?], let the wild romper start

[Chorus: Vast Aire]
It's what
Your life, get hype if you with me
Don't rush
You fight, too much time for remedies
You bust back, fight
Alright, take what's given
Anybody, anything, could be a monster

[Verse 3: Vast Aire]
Look dude, anyone can be a monster
Under the bed or in the closet, you're too lethargic
You better take what's given
Or I'ma leave this God-forsaken rock that's spinning
Look at the beast drool as he does a backstroke in a cesspool
Yo, I heard they waiting 'til nighttime to come out
Bellycrawlers, they can't wait to let they fangs out
Creatures use the dark to fuck with your mind
That's why I leave 'em in pieces like Frankenstein
I throw garlic at A&R's
I can get mad, turn green, and flip cars
So make room for the CEO of the Blue Lagoon
That's why I'm stacking ammo for my platoon
And on the full moon, I killed the howling man
Cause I am Hunter D, with the talking hand

[Chorus: Vast Aire]
It's what
Your life, get hype if you with me
Don't rush
You fight, too much time for remedies
You bust back, fight
Alright, take what's given
Anybody, anything, could be a monster
