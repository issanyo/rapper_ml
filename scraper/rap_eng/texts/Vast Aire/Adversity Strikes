[Intro]
You know, sometimes we're not prepared for adversity, when it happens sometimes we're caught short; we don't know exactly how to handle it...when it comes up. Sometimes we don't know just what to do when adversity takes over, and I have advice for all of you

[Hook: Vast Aire]
I'm from the Atoms Fam and it's the small things that count
And the atom is a small thing with a large destruction amount

[Verse 1: Vast Aire]
I want to live a long life (life)
I don't want to disappear with the sunrays when they fall over the mountain
So until then, life maintains
Callises, the antimantium nutshell frame
This shit ain't cotton-candy; ponies
The alarm sounds
I wake up in an ebony mahogany poverty stricken
By the lightning rods that came from grey clouds with a silver lining
Sparsely painted, outlined even, but purposely tainted
So I can misread the guidelines of the sky's limit
On the sidelines in small print written in bluish tint
I think hard
Like Christopher Wallace with a cheeseburger on his mind in his last minutes
Damn, you gotta excuse my French
Sometimes I speak in kissing swords but I don't know how to fence
But these words will make your head bop, but you lost hold
Like the 39 souls that were told
To hold on to the tail-end of the Hale-Bopp
Divine parasites? Put a muzzle on it
Reality Bites
Yo kid I'm Christ-like, like HAL
Rhymes are flows and I walk among them
Like a traitor within a crew of thirteen
With a cellular fingertip as E.T. to make contact with the unseen
You tellin lies wearin gasoline Levi's
Cause man was made to crawl, to walk, but never to fly
It's in our genes, I'm trying to close the gap that bleeds
While you continuously bite the hand that feeds
My life has become an odd number while you slept in
Wonder the rings that I've conquered through pondering
Through sentences I run after I leave the track
And cross the finish line in four minutes flat
I'm a peaceful cat but I respect beef like a Hindu
And cross that fine line and Atoms will feast on idiom barbecue

[Hook]

"One plus one get it together"

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
Swingin at my man but got trapped in a vast nucleus
In order to keep face, I make up for the blemished surface
Commercial hip-hop is like dermatology
They only study the surface of the common shell (you know?)
Must one fail for another to pass?
Said by a wise man watching a fool pull a mule's ass
You know us black kids we all look alike
So I'm born without a face cause I don't want to be like Mike
Unless he comes from starvin' Happy Harlem
Where that name is a pun cause when you hungry it ain't fun man
And these crooks 'r' us toy guns
Play with guns in the back of alleys
Yes- falling leaves from disfunctional family trees
Daughters and sons
Yeah, I hold all my rhymes in my palm so when I drop lines
They're sometimes deeper than a
Penny that dwells within the bottom of a thirsty wishing well in Hell
So appreciate these outspoken tokens
From a member of the Starship Enterprise who built with the last Vulcan

And I'm from the Atoms Fam and it's the small things that count
And the atom is a small thing with a large destruction amount
