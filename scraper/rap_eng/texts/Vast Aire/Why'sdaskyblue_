Atoms

[Verse 1]
I heard justice was blind when Uncle Sam fucked her
I heard she came when he whispered he loved her
Young and naieve she thought nothing of it
And respecting her, he thought nothing of it
I just want to get my point across like Jezus
So I look to the sky like Hey Zeus
You got answers, Cause I got questions
Fold my arms peep the clouds and receive lessons
First we stopped stressin
Then we learned mathematics and we count blessings, God
At the age of 10 I picked up the pen
Fire's pretty and it burns and I learned that then
After school we were slap box
And my man Terrence, he had jokes of whoever had loos sox
See I'mma win this battle
And later tonight your girl's gonna hear my love rattle
Yes niggas it's dark outside
It's so could your time time a died

[Hook]
You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and change my best steps
Everytime the beat break

You don't wanna dance with me, you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and chance my best steps
Everytime the beat breaks

[Verse 2]
It was asked before Lopez
Her name was Taiwanda
She went to IS 238
Suzanne B Anthony
We called it B Tony
If you class of '92 you should know me
Jamaica High, that was my first cipher
Everyday we slammed the mic like Bill Holiday with a rose in her hair
At 6th grade my favorite wrestler was Rick Flair
Remember Lee Patches and the Playboy ten tops
And if you don't you could get figure four leglock
If I was 12 I would backspin on you
Shill 5 saturday morning karate
This is win every videogame was 8-bit
And you would get popped in your mounth for talking shit
I wrote this rhyme thinking of 50 Cents and Ashy Elbows
Summertime nights and stairin out the window
And if you hear gunshots you gonna hear a widow
Cryin' five seconds apart like thunder and lightning
(Know what I'm sayin, just put your feet on ice)

[Hook]
You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
Cause I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and change my best steps
Everytime the beat breaks

You don't wanna dance with me, cause you a fake
I can do the wop and the snake
And mess around and change my best steps
Everytime the beat breaks

"Yo V.A., pass the mic for chrissake!"

[Verse 3]
Just me and my peers spittin' raps for years
Sight for sore eyes, sound for sore ears
Cause where I'm from they be like "run your coat black?"
All I find the key in 10 seconds flat
So I wouldn't do that, nuh
Let me rephrase don't go there
And you can not hold air
Some of us knuckle up some got the shaddy
Some do the Roger Rabbit with drugs in the lobby
And when the 5-O show the van
They do the runnin' man
I could never choose a side
Until I saw the hustler's electric slide
