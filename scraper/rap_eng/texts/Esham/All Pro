I got much love for the gangsters and the thugs
And all my little pretty bitches giving me hugs
Make it do what it do
Then i did what it does
The stereo was bumping
Playing was not was
But I'm ready for the world
But this ain't ohh Sheila
I stumble to my boot
Cos i was drunk off the tequila
Man you don't want to see us
Getting dough like pizzerias
If that's the case
I got to burn your ass like Gonorrhea
Be a man
Take a stand
Take your losses
Ain't the plan
I'm connected with the bosses
All across this fucking land
Grand slam ,not the breakfast
A iced out necklace
And get your head chopped off in Detroit
For being reckless
Like what they done to me
These niggers hungry
Only fashion you'll see
Is Dickies or some Duggerys
Maybe army fatigues
Cos my city's under siege
By the CIA , the FBI and crooked police. i rock shows
I get hoes
Selling out my logo
I'm all pro
