[VERSE 1]
This is the beginning of another sin
All ya'll welcome to Hell cause my record's spinning
So many cried cause the rhythm but I'm still grinning
And I've brought death to every jam I've been in
Let me begin, amen for the brothers and sisters
A musical sacrifice for Esham's listeners
Every time I grab the mic I leave blood stains
Cause I'm flowing like a blood vein
I'm like the Devil, I flow like a creep show
And you're wondering how deep can my rhyme go, yo
S-I-N, as I begin I sin
It would be wise to notify your next of kin
Grab a mic in the moonlight and start to recite
Look me in the face when I'm rapping and lose your sight
Said I was a Devil worshiper
Esham I never heard of a sucker like you
Another silent murder
Killed him in the moonlight
Listen to me recite
Another sin, so here I go again
Deadly notorious, I'm poisonous
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
Dead men don't sing
I bring terror like Idi Amin
It's a pity the Devil's a human being
I rap like a Gypsy so witness a psycho work
Give me a beat, I'll get unholy in a church
My music is underground, a spiritual sound
I got your head spinning like a merry-go-round
Some say I escaped from a psycho ward
I died when I picked up the mic to recite
Many rhymes, unleash the fury of a madman
666 and a mic in my hand
I'm like Sinbad, badder than LL and Mike J
Everybody grab a cross
Tonight we say, "Amen."
