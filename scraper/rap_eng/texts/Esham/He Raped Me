[INTRO]
I don't know why he did this
I told him no
Or maybe I meant yes
I don't know what I meant
All I know is he raped me
And he didn't give me no money, neither

[VERSE 1]
Now bitches want respect
And all that's fine
But how do you know when
A bitch is playin' on your mind
A ho will be a ho
A silly ho and I know
Wanna break me
'Cause she hate me
Sayin', "He raped me"
I'm caught up in this bullshit
Inside we go
Head spinnin' like Michael
(TNT)
Now how can the ho say you took the puss
When she let you get that hose
To water that bush
(ESHAM)
Stupid ho want the love
Of the nappy pappy
But I ain't givin' up no love
You can slap me if I'm happy
But I ain't
And 'cause I got the P for free
Because the ho can't be with me
She turned around and said, "He raped me"

[VERSE 2]
I can't understand hoes nowaday
Givin' up the fuckin' pussy
Then turn around and say
(MASTAMIND)
"It's a date rape, it's a hate rape, it's a mind rape
(ESHAM)
Well if you're cryin' rape
It's a motherfuckin' mistake
Bitches like Desiree Washington
Suck a dick so dry
That your balls get numb
And if you cum in her mouth
She goin' to tell
To try to get your ass locked in a cell
Well, just 'cause a nigga don't love you back
You played the dirty mack
And dropped the dime on my bozack
In fact, 'cause a nigga got the P for free
And 'cause the ho can't be with me
She turned around and said, "He raped me"

[VERSE 3]
Now silly, silly, silly, silly, silly ass ho
Wanna scream rape
'Cause she can't get the dick no mo'
And so, a nigga like me caught a case
'Cause I let her suck my dick
And nutted in her face
This is ludicrous
Tell me what'd I do to this bitch
Suckin' dick ain't nothin' new to this bitch
She's a ho
A yamp, tramp hooker on the stroll
And if your dick gets swole
Life without parole (Oh no!)
The ho got me like Mike Tyson
I can't escape
These charges on date rape
Sodomized and to my surprise
I didn't realize
She'd turn around and say I raped her
