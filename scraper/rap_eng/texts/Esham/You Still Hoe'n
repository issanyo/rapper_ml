[Verse 1:]
Now this goes out to all the big butt sluts
Makin mo' niggas nut and gettin played like mutts
Now say ho, I spent my last on a ho to let you know
It dont pay to be a ho, 'cause I tally up ho's
Like dominos stack em, knock em down and smack em
Rack em up and shack em, baby boy I mack em
But hey, it ain't no thang to me to play yo ass like P
I mean bitch a get dissed ho fuckin with this
It ain't no ho's out there I respect
See bitch you betta run a mic check 1-2-eh yo ho
Your big booty in them coochie cut daisey's
You askin for some money but your juices got me crazy
And ho, I might give up the dough, 'cause ain't no thang to a true
Twenty dollars ain't shit ho I thought you knew
Just to fuck it, I'll give up the ducket's
I got your legs cocked in the back seat of my bucket
Will you suck it for another 20/20 ho Im feindin
Ridin down the mile in my drop top leanin
Stank ho, stank ho, I gotta know stank ho...
Is you still ho'in

[Verse 2:]
Is you still ho'in, bitch you still fuckin?
It's written on your lips no payin no suckin
Project ho, neighborhood star
You won't get far I dont care who's ho you are
Check mic, check mic, one, two, one, two
Ya momma had you...and she a ho too
But hey, it's all in the games you play
'cause ho's like you was raised to be that way
Say ho, you still doin that thang with ya body
Suckin on dicks drinkin cum like Bacardi
Ain't nothin but a party goin on with ya pussy
If pussies could talk, It'd say "ho please douche me"
And ho, you know like I know you know
You was a ho from Tokyo a long time ago
Ain't nothin but the freak of the week
I thought she was p-funk gettin knee deep
From the front to the back of a Fleetwood Cadillac
Suckin on her titties try'in to get a little similac
Uh, can I get a witness, when I ask this
Is you still ho'in
