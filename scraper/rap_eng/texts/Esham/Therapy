[INTRO: DEADBOY]
Yeah, this is motherfucking Deadboy up in this bitch
Yo, I got my motherfucking nigga Esham
Ready to kick this shit for you hoes

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
Walking on the flatlines
Fumbling with the razor blade
Rumbling with the ace of spades
Is where the wicket rhymes are made
Sometimes I really feel
Like I just can't deal
With the pressures of life
So I walk around with the bloody butcher knife
Therapy, man I need some therapy
Cause ain't nobody scaring me
I ain't got no love cause no one cares for me
Slipping it into to darkness
I'm beyond that and past that
Once I catch a flashback
Snap and that's yo ass
Black Devil get a shovel, grave digga
How you figure you going to kill a dead nigga
You going to kill a dead nigga
Bloody body, baby bloody, man I'm nutty, what he thought
Nine dead bodies and I never got caught
Walk the flatlines, man I walk the flatlines
And dead body chalk lines make me walk lines
I don't sniff lines
Forty-Five slug to my mind
Sometime I feel I'm on the flatline
Man I need some therapy

[DEADBOY]
Fuck it
Nigga all fucked up in this bitch
I don't give a fuck about shit
I don't give a fuck about these dollars, motherfucker
What up

[VERSE 2:  ESHAM]
I'm having suicidal thoughts
Brain cells dead from the coma
My aroma
Dead body rotten
Gone but not forgotten
Seems like you forgot
Man I took one shot
Now I lay me down to sleep
Body hot, rot
Got no love when I was a toddler
Now I swallow bullets for fun
Playing games with a gun
Ho I spit up
Get up
Throw up
Mind blow up
I told my teacher I wanted to be like Hitler when I grow up
Now I got a mental Glock
Got the pussy hammer cocked
Tick-tock and you don't stop
Make the pussy pop
'Til the break of dawn, 'til the break of dawn
Once again it's on
Three-Fifty-Seven chrome plated to my dome
Now I know you want to know about knowing what I know
And if you knew me you would know that I be flowing
Dead boy killa
Guerilla, stilla, illa, chilla
I'm going out of my mind on the reala, my nilla
Man I need some therapy

[DEADBOY]
Motherfuckers don't know me
Running up in my face and shit
Bitch, back the fuck up
Don't look at me motherfucker
What nigga

[VERSE 3:  ESHAM]
So tell me what you think about the psychadelic
Funkadelic relic
In my maggot brain
All type of things happen insane
I can't explain how I wonder
Let me take you under
With this suicidalist
Ain't afraid to die
Who wonders why I think this way
So we all got to die one fucking day
Ain't no way I'm going to say I love you now
Cause my heart's so cold I don't know how
Now you hate what you create
Wicket mind state
Got a date with death and what's left's my fate
Fuck tomorrow, no sorrow
I live today
And I don't give a fuck about what you say
I'm going to ride this suicide
This I decide this
Life I live
All take no give
And if I take some back then I must be wrong
But dead men don't sing no fucking songs
I need some therapy

[DEADBOY]
Fuck it
I ain't got no love for bitches out in this motherfucker
I ain't got no love for no niggas out in this motherfucker
If I can't see that shit, the shit ain't real
Ain't no love, motherfucker
Ain't no love out in this motherfucker
Bitches don't give a fuck about no nigga
Bitches not even a bitch with a baby
Nigga, you get a baby by a bitch
She don't give a fuck about you, motherfucker
Fuck that ho
Get these dollars, nigga
These dollars, that's what it's about
Yo, it's that nigga Deadboy, and I'm out
