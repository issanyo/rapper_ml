[VERSE 1]
Woke up in the morning cause my snooze wasn't working
Got funky fresh and took a swig of Erk & Jerk and
Stepped outside jumped into my ride
Seen a couple of freaks standing down at the store
I started to go down there
I seen my man GG
He said they're all ugly, so fuck them hoes
I kept on cruising to get my boy TNT
He said "What's up?"
I said "What's up? You're coming to hang with me."
We jumped in the car and hit the mile with style
When the hoes saw a nigga all they said was "Wow!"
We're rolling off East and we're headed out West
Just in case they're ill I got my bullet proof vest
But it ain't complete without the heat under the seat
But I won't fuck with you unless you fuck with me
Hoes giving looks and smile
But I'm here to profile with style and cruise 7 Mile

[HOOK]
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Suck my dick")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Bitch on the gank move")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Still talking shit")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Suck my dick")

[VERSE 2]
Hit the West side cause that's where all the hoes at
And every real nigga in Detroit knows that
I'm rolling low profile riding the bumps
Fuck the police, I let my system thump
Boom is the sound you hear coming from the rear
And all the bitches say, "Look, look down there!"
Low down, dirty dog 3 inches off the ground
Feel the bass knocking on the other side of town
Some niggas into gang banging, some into dope slanging
I'm into fucking hoes, counting cash, and street hanging
Never like another bro, better ask your mother ho
Reel Life Production is fucking up your stereo
Riding like a rodeo, hoes wanna holler so
Pull to the curb, what's your name and your number ho
Haven't got time for the lines I'm throwing you
Give me your number, later on I'll call you
The bitch gave me her number and left with a smile
I know how to play that ho cause I met her on 7 Mile

[HOOK]
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Bitch")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Criminal minded")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("Gangster Boogie, Gangster Boogie")
Cruising down 7 Mile
("How you like me now")

[VERSE 3]
Rolling off West and I'm headed for the East side
I see some hoes pointing saying, "There goes Esham!"
Not watching the road, thinking about what they said
I hit a crackhead, now the crackhead's dead
Hit and run, fuck him cause he's already dead
Besides I did him a favor, he was a crackhead
Besides I ain't stopping, I'll let the next car stop
It gives me more time to get down the block
And make a right chill into the crib for a while
And keep my black ass off 7 Mile
