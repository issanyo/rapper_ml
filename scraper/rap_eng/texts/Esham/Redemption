[Intro: Esham]
Oh my god
You came into my life
And turned my world around
I was lost
I couldn't see
My sight was gone
Couldn't find my home
So you know
I smoked some weed and took some pills and even sniffed some blow
And so I repent
Cause all the blessings I've received I know were heaven-sent

[Verse 1: Esham]
I never knew when I spit this shit
Every rapper in the world be on some wicked shit
Its like the first time I hit this shit
See you bit this shit
But won't admit this shit
You saw me shine and sunlit this shit
On my knees at night asking should I quit this shit
When I first started we were total opposites
I took a stand so you could sit
You fuckin hypocrites
I'm looking for salvation
For all of my sins
Through Jesus sacrifice
Is we living wicked nation
I'm saying amen
Cause I don't wanna die

[Chorus: Syn]
IT'S ALL ABOUT REDEMPTION
EVERYTHING I DID, AND WHAT I SAID
ITS ALL ABOUT REDEMPTION
IF WE CAN FORGIVE
WE CAN FORGET
IT'S ALL ABOUT REDEMPTION

[Verse 2: Esham]
It was him
The devil in disguise
With a gun standing right before my eyes
He wanted my life
The wicked shit I speak was never ment for the weak
I'm running outta time
Going outta my mind
Dodging demons in the street
God, please give me a sign
Inherit the earth
Only the children of the weak
So if you really wanna see my soul in hell
Spittin wicked shit I tell the coldest tale
My conscience catch heat its getting old and stale
Its hard to embrace what I hold is hell
If you walk the bloody tail
Bring your holy grail
The devil went after my soul but god closed the cell
Even though the wicked shit knows me well
You won't see me on the wagon as it goes to hell
Believe me hell is lonely
Believe I've been there
My soul he spared
And don't nobody know me
And only he cares
That's why I'm there
It's raining diamonds

[Chorus]
