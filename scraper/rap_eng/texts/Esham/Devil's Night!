[VERSE 1]
Esham's back in the house for Devil's Night
And I'm going to get me some gasoline
And burn down the whole scene
Wicket rhymes I be wrestling
You better cover your ass
Cause I'mma do you with no Vaseline
Stick 'em, stuck 'em
I fuck 'em up and fuck 'em up good
Freak the funk so I fuck it up like a G should
Burn your house to the ground and watch you all cry
Pour gas all around and hope you all die
The type of arsonist niggas never ever seen
If you saw me, you see me smelling like kerosene
I got a magic trick, burn you like a drippy dick
Somebody pass me a Bic
On Devil's Night

[VERSE 2]
Watch a nigga get ill like Fire Marshall Bill
Gasoline will spill from here to Louisville
I got a flamethrower
Arsonist
Suicidalist
Burn your motherfucking ass up to a crisp
Strike 'em, struck 'em
Burn 'em up, fuck 'em
Fire man come
Buck, buck, buck 'em
Cause I'm a fireman but I got a gas can
Shoot the gas can
And blast your ass man
Shit God damn
I smell smoke
Slit a nigga's throat
And fuck the okey doke
Cause I gotta burn 'em
Teach 'em and learn 'em
Until I get a turn
Burn Hollywood, burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
Burn motherfucker
Burn 'til you're ashes
I burn niggas up when I get hot flashes
I slash his throat
And choke off the gun smoke
Then blaze that ass like a J
On Devil's Night

[VERSE 3]
Devil's Night
I need a light so I can blaze a
Police station
Wicket Hellraiser
Playing no games
Shit's going up in flames
No evidence, no nothing, no names
Return of the Dragon
But I'm fire kickin'
Your ass'll be crispy like Kentucky Fried Chicken
Cracker, burner, nigga, blacker
I'm a ramshackle
Snap, pop, crackle
Didn't do a thing with my gasoline
Until I flame broiled your ass like Burger King
Now you're in trouble
Watch your skin bubble
Set me a fire
Get away on the double
Arsonist
Watch me just set a fucking blaze
Watch it burn down
Cold staring in a daze
Wanna set a fire
I'll be your tutor
Burn up your city like the LA looters
When you set a blaze
You gotta do it right
Watch, somebody give me a light
On Devil's Night
