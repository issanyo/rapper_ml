[VERSE 1]
Woke up early Sunday morning
And before I could get out of bed
I got blood stains all on my t-shirt
Last night my homie caught a slug in his head
It was a Saturday night and everything was all right
Until some fool tried to disrespect
My homie whipped out the heater
The 9-millimeter
And cold put his ass in check
Well, them suckers rolled off
And we thought it was over
But little did we know we was wrong
Them came racing 'round the corner
Barrels sticking out the window
Bullets flying, cold blew out his dome
My homie got shot

[HOOK]
My homie got shot, he's a goner black
(He's a goner)
My homie got shot, he's a goner black
(My homie got shot)

[VERSE 2]
My homie fell to the ground and I knew he was dead
By the painful look in his face
Bloodstains on my shirt
God damn my nigga hurt
Cause his brain was all over the place
Well, I'm cold thinking about getting back
Time for the payback
I know where these niggas be
When they shot my fucking homie
They left me by my lonely
And cold took a piece of me
Well, I got to creep up on 'em
'Bout to to put one in 'em
But before I could do all that
A nigga caught my ass slipping at point blank range
.45 put 'em in my back
My homie got shot

[HOOK]
