That ain't happenin'
Well
Muthafuckas tryin' to kill me and shit, out here
Well
10 years agom a friend of mine spit somethin' called acid rap
Rapped about the darkest shit I ever done heard of, swear I never heard of nuttin' like that
Just a kid alone on a microphone rappin' these boomin' words from hell
Sellin' tapes out his trunk for a couple of months, but soon ghetto millionaires crown well
Esham Smith and his brother James, payin outta half the state
With a brand new style called the wicked shit, sellin' faster than the shit could be made
What's Esham like? Is he really like that? Is Oshay really a natural born killa?
With them it's OK all day, with Esham no way, cause his shit be soundin' way realla
He does the Devil's shit, do you believe in God? It's the story of Esham The Unholy
And if you askin' me, how the fuck I know? Because the muthafucka just told me, BYATCH!
