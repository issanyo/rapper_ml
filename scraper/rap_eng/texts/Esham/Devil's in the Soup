[INTRO]
Shit you talking might have once been true
But this is one time I don't think your motherfucking punk will do
Ladies and gentlemen here he is
The man that recorded "Eat Out More Often"
And "This Pussy Belongs To Me"
Let's hear it for Mister...

[VERSE 1]
Now I know it's (a like that fearin'???)
But you still want to hear that Unholy spirit
Still getting done by none
Pulled up a dress and fucked a nun
The walls sweat blood from thinking about sex
As your clit gets wet
You're hot like fire, you desire
More than pleasure, much more higher
Your nipples on your chest start to bleed
The soup is getting hot, time to feed
Your Heaven is burning
As you're masturbating, but still you're yearning
The fire is getting very hot
As you stick your finger in the soup inside the pot
You begin to stir it
Lick your finger to taste it, but it's not done yet
A snow white virgin
Operating on yourself like a medical surgeon
Something you love to do
Who would've thought it was you
The Devil's in the soup

[HOOK]
The Devil's in the soup (x3)

[VERSE 2]
Break out the mixing spoon
And stir it up with all you got
The soup is getting hotter and hotter
Running all down the side of the pot
Juice is on the covers
I think I smell a little tuna inside that soup
So what you putting in it
The basic four fingered food groups
All alone
'Cause you feed for a minute, add meat and bones
So the Devil's in your soup
Your panties all wet from spilling that soup
Homemade, never stored in cans
Always made with hands
I think your starting to stick to the pot
That means soup's too hot
It's so hot it burns
So stick a spoon in it and give a couple turns
And I thought you was a good girl
Never let nobody inside your world
So the Devil's in the soup
How'd you let the Devil get inside your soup
Been thinking about sex
Next thing you know, you'll be wearing a Kotex
When the walls come down
And the soups in the cupboard there to be found
You've committed sin
But when the Devil's in the soup, it'll happen again

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Masturbating, demonstrating good love
Knowing damn well that ain't what you thinking of
You're thinking about coming
For the first time, you're out your mind
You don't know what you're doing
But it feels so good you could think you're screwing
You feel something tingle
As you giggle and start to wiggle but still single
Playing that Esham tape
So much love and so much hate
Your emotions run wild
Feeling more like a woman and less like a child
Get ready for the fountain
'Cause you'll be coming around the mountain
Any minute with the soup
'Cause the Devil's still tasting and she's wasting
Soup in her clothes
But she's the only one that knows
About that dish
Squaggy juice which smells like fish
And she loves to fix it
Her favorite part is when she mix it
Virgins want to have fun to
But when they do
The Devil's in the soup

[HOOK]
