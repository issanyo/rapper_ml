[VERSE 1]
I thought you knew
But it seems you don't
So now I got to put you in your place
Because most niggas won't
Give you all a piece of my mind
The truth'll set you free
And the truth is hard to find
Had a little ho
She loved to wine & dine
Her favorite number's 69
So is mine
In those times a nigga felt good
In the Sunshine
I misunderstood
Many hoes, many hoes
I ran through plenty hoes, plenty hoes
Call me a pimp or a mack dad
Or call me Mr. Prophylac-dad
It's a toss-up if my homies fell through
See I shouldn't have to tell you
I thought you knew

[VERSE2 ]
I thought you knew
About the Unholy Black Devil
Dick in my hand
To let you know where I stand
I'm with my man with the 40 in his hand
I can't trust the cops cause they're the Klu Klux Klan
Motown, all the real niggas know
The radio tried to play me out like a ho
Cause I won't criss-cross over to the pop
Just cause I got a little problem with the cops
Props come and the radio go
But I ain't nobody's ho
I thought you knew

[VERSE 3]
I thought you knew
About a nigga like me
I'm just into clocking cash
But some niggas clocking me
And still don't know the time
All on my line
Just cause I'm fucking your woman's mind
I got to get my roll on
I got to get my stroll on
I got to get them on
And once it's on, I'm feeling alright
I think I'm going to
Fuck your woman tonight
Cause I don't care
I don't give a fuck
About how she kissing your baby
And how she suckin' my nuts
I fucked her in the butt like yesterday
But I ain't got nothing else to say
I thought you knew
