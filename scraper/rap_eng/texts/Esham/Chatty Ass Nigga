This goes out to all you chatty ass motherfuckers
Wack motherfuckers
Can't fuck with the mad motherfuckers
Chatty ass motherfucker

[VERSE 1:  MASTAMIND]
It ain't shit wicket like this wicket, Wicketshit
You want me to kick this shit
Well let me kick it bitch
Here he is, that nigga who's so mysterious
You dying to know who I be
You so curious
You say "How can I be down, how can I be liked?"
"How can I be ever wicket on the mic?"
Hey yo, I'm so sick of this shit
So I'm sick with this here
It's so ridiculous, I got you bitches living in fear
I see so many motherfuckers faking and duplicatin
Trying to be like (NATAS, SATAN, SATAN, NATAS, NATAS, SATAN)
You can bite the style for a while, but still feel chatty
Yo, I ain't happy so don't come at me

[HOOK]
You's a chatty ass nigga
A chatty ass nigga
(x4)

[VERSE 2:  TNT]
Chatty ass nigga, nigga chatty
Call me mack daddy
When I'm rolling through your fucking hood
The bitches know it's all good (it's all good)
Down for the dirt (nigga)
Putting in work (nigga)
Lifting up skirts (nigga)
Bitches get hurt (nigga)
It's that nigga TNT
Bitch you better recognize
Fucking with The Voodoo Child
Bitch you could leave paralyzed
Keep my fucking name out your mouth before I blast ya
Nobody asked ya
I rolls like Casper
Boom, boom, boom
Bitch dropped dead
Some slugs in his head for some shit he just said
Chatty ass niggas don't live long
And most dead niggas don't sing no songs

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3:  ESHAM]
You's a chatty bitch
Call me pimp daddy, bitch
Never loved a ho, and had he switched
Then you'll know who's on my dick
(Who's on my dick?)
I don't know, stay up off my dick though
Quick to kick the sick flow
Dissing all wicked hoes
And we be foes not friends
'Cause I can't deal with your ills
I gives a fuck how you feel
(Player hater) I ain't got no love for your kind
You be hoping that I fall
So fuck all of y'all

[HOOK]

[OUTRO]
Now what kinda nigga is a chatty ass nigga
(That bitch nigga is a chatty ass nigga)
(x2)
