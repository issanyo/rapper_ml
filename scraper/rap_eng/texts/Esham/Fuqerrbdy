[HOOK]
Fuck, fuck, fuck, uh
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck everybody
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck everybody
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck everybody
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck everybody

[MASTAMIND]
God damn it I said it
Fuck everybody
NATAS [???] any Tom, Dick, and Charlie
I mean that shit, never sorry
Times have changed today
I'm getting higher than Bob Marley

[ESHAM]
F-U-C-K-E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y
Fuck the CIA and the FBI
When my shotgun Blaz4me
To Hell's where I'm sending 'em
Fuck the twelve jurors
And that bitch George Zimmerman

[HOOK]

[MASTAMIND]
Fuck everything you like and love
Believe it
I don't need Flavor Flav to hype it up
NATAS in this bitch
Time to rock this bitch
Welcome to the apocalypse
You're welcome to follow this
Come on, fuck you, kill yourself
Just when you thought, "I'mma die a simple death"
Just when you thought ain't no real niggas left
NATAS, fuck everybody

[HOOK]

[ESHAM]
I say fuck all these rappers
I say fuck all these DJs
Fuck these radio stations
And every record they replay
All this he say, she say
Only doing what we say
Sold that Boomin' Words from Hell
Five hundred dollars on eBay
Nigga, fuck

[MASTAMIND]
If you hate me, get in line
Must I rewind who I am
Michael Jackson:  Remember the Time
'Bout to Moonwalk on your grave
Better run and hide somewhere
Deep off in a cave

[ESHAM]
Those janky promoters
Who can't fuck with these Wicket flowers
And niggas who got on with this style like they don't know us
I'll kill your whole family with the 12-gauge Mossberg
Stick my dick all in your ear
Fuck what you heard
Pussy

[HOOK]

[TNT]
I say fuck everybody
Come through in a Maserati
Crazy shoot up your party
Know I'm down to catch a hommie
And my name ain't Tommy
But I know he'll figure
So the nigga'll try me
I'm like fuck

[MASTAMIND]
If you don't know who I am, do your research
You's a dead man, you gonna need a hearse
I'm saying fuck you, 'cause you said fuck me first
I say FUQERRBDY on the front of my t-shirt

[HOOK]
