[VERSE 1]
Born broke, beat up, and always hungry
Never thought I'd turn into a criminal, if anything
Running from the cops like Al Capone
Going Rambo on them suckers like Sly Stallone
Got a gat in my pants like it's part of my belt
Suckers scared like butter so they start to melt
I'm staying solid like concrete
In Detroit's streets
What a rich man throws away is what a poor man eats
When I was 5 my mind started to blow up
Told my teacher I wanted to be like Hitler when I grow up
When I was 7 disregarded the laws of Heaven
I went to church on Sunday and I cussed out The Reverend
When I was 10 I started committing sin
Witchcraft and Voodoo with needles and pins
When I became an adolescent
I never learned my lesson
Putting holes in motherfuckers with a fucking Smith & Wesson
A homicidal, vital recital
Esham's my title
I know my shit is def and I know you want to bite, oh
But no don't do it
You'll be just a carbon copy
Esham is original and everybody else is sloppy
But chill, I kill
I'm sweet like Sugar Hill
Not your average, everyday, elementary, run-of-the-mill
Motherfucker get it straight
I don't battle, that's for suckers
You wish you was down with Reel Life Products
Ain't that right brother
I don't bullshit
No need to pull shit
You pull some shit
And you'll be full of bullets and shit
Brother think I'm bluffing
Pull my bluff and get fucked up and stuff
It's time for me to shut up cause I really said enough
