[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
All day listening
To your complaining
Got me thinking 'bout
Punching you in the face
Restraining
High prices
Indecisive
Living in excess
Success, suck
She's a succulent succubus
She hate me
She love me
I go to Hell if she hug me
I'm in Heaven
She fucked me
I guess I'm feeling that lucky
My last dance
No finance
No chance for romance
All my friends can't understand
Why I can't seem to let you go

[HOOK]
Super high maintenance
(Super high maintenance)

[VERSE 2:  TNT]
All night listening
To your complaining
Day dreaming about sunshine
When I know it's raining
I'm a fiend
For that Maybelline
God Save the Queen
Drinkin' lean
And the thought of losing you
Makes me scream
Lord have mercy
I'm so thirsty
When I'm drinking with you
Have your cake and eat it too
Is what I'm thinking of you
I say she's sexy in them high heels
She's a big deal
Could put a frown on
A motherfuckin' Happy Meal

[HOOK]
