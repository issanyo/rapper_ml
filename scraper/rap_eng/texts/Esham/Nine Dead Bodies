[INTRO]
(Radio news samples)

[VERSE 1]
I've seen nine bloody bodies in my life time
Now, I'm on the prowl and it's night time
Son of the wicket, I kick it
Five fingers of death
I can taste the smell of blood as you're losing your breath
Nine bodies floating in the river
This the type of shit to make you shiver when I deliver
The first dead body on your door step
When you open up the door the body falls on the floor
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Then their head pops off and rolls down the hall
Blood stains all on my shoe strings
Two bodies found swinging in the back and they hang
From a tree butt naked
Three lives are gone and the fourth I must take it
The fourth body, just mutilated
Every bone was broken in the body when they x-rayed it
I got a craving for some red rum
So I went to the store and saw the clerk and got me some
One person found dead at the liquor store
A mass murderer, five murders or more
Now I'm working on my sixth one
I kill bitches with my bare hands
Motherfuck a gun
Beat a bitch with a bat 'til she stopped breathing
Then they rushed the bloody body to the cement
Seven and eight came like a double-take
I stabbed them both in the heart with a wooden stake
Like the bitches was a fucking vampires
Lit the fuses, set their soul on fire
Number nine...

This my own life
It was fast, with a nine to my head
And I want it
I'm dead
You're dead
Call the cops
Shit, somebody call the cops
