[INTRO]
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
One day
I'mma learn
Ho ass niggas ain't worth my while
Funny style actin'
Dirty mackin'
Player hatin'
Contemplatin'
Fuckin' my thoughts up
I get caught up in this bullshit
The way bitches pull shit
Niggas be jealous
Sometimes even my fellas
Things change
Niggas rearrange
What could ya tell us
Life is bullshit
And I know that this is true
Sometimes I feel depressed
What can a nigga do
Ain't no way out
Only way out is the route
Of a slug point blank at my mug
Sometimes I just wanna scream at the world, "I'm mad"!
Other times I feel happy just to be sad
I don't really got much more to say
'Cause people die every day
And we gonna all die anyway
It's kinda hard
But t who said life was fair
And from the dookie stains in my underwear
I don't care

[HOOK]
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

[VERSE 2:  MASTAMIND]
No I don't care no more
No I don't care if niggas stare at me
Look at my face, I ain't happy
Bitch what you wanna come at me
With not that same shit
See I'm shameless
And I hang with that mentally deranged clique
Stay off my dick
You can't change this
Can't teach a wicked witch new tricks
Hell's the fire on the candle sticks
Sick of these bloody streets
But don't wanna see no peace
I just don't give a fuck
'Cause nobody gives a fuck about me
So we be like fuck 'em
Motherfuck 'em
Can't trust 'em
I'd rather .45 slug 'em
Before the grave diggers drug 'em
I'm ready when you not
My mind's twisted in a knot
Can't let jealous niggas see me
'Cause they'd kill me on the spot
Truth or dare
My gun won't shoot up in the air
Pieces of my mind are here and there
And there
But I don't care

[OUTRO:  ESHAM]
How can I care about somethin'
When I don't give a fuck about nothin'
You dont care about me
You don't love me
And I don't love me
So fuck you
And fuck you
Fuck he
Fuck she
Fuck your G-O-D, nigga
You know what I'm sayin'
I don't care
No, I don't care
I don't care
