[VERSE 1:  MASTAMIND]
Mr. Hellraiser's in the house
Raising hell higher
Fool, don't get too close to the fire
Silly punk, piece of shit
I'm down for a dirty trick
That's why blood's on my hands
Somebody got hit
I throw my gun way up
Wait until you're sprayed up
Sorry little nigga your last day is up, huh
NATAS in the house to haunt it for you
So don't ask who motherfucker
Yo, boo, motherfucker
Can you rock it like this?
I can rock it like that
Get the gat, get the gat
Put him on his back, flat
Manic madmen don't give a fuck
Nobody move, nobody gets fucked up
I'm 'bout to do some dirt

[Chorus 2x: Mastamind (Esham)]
Motherfucker bout to put in work
Motherfucker bout to put in work
I'm bout to do sum dirt
Motherfucker bout to put in work
Motherfucker bout to put in work
Watch me do a little dirt

[Verse Two: Mastamind]
Killer cop on my tail, wanna throw me in a jail
Stop him in his tracks, take his ass straight to hell
No mercy on my man no can't give a cop that
Can't give a cop jack but a slug when I cock back
Years of many tears fly by, life's a bitch then you die
But I don't ask why, I'm a bad guy
So I'm better off dead now, go ahead now, put me to bed now
Rollin' to temple with a plan for the holy man
Damn, you don't know me man
Rollin' like a killer only can
Wicked man said I wasn't blessed
Bust a bloody chest
With a vest, so I make a mess
I'm bout 2 do sum dirt

[Chorus 2x]
[Verse Three: Mastamind]
12 o'clock madman, chillin' under the cherry moon
Got him in my scope, soon you'll hear the boom
I'mma let ya roll, then I'll roll ya bank roll
Ya can't move cause ya froze up, yeah it's a hold up
Put 'yo hands in the air motherfucker
Let 'em wave in the sky, behave or you'll die
Killing for a living like a hitman, you looking at a sick man
Holy shit, goddamn!
Give me ya daily bread, I need to be fed
I'll pop this through ya soul, put a price on ya head
A suicidal problem to the ??? who don't care
The Games Master can't play fair
I'm 'bout 2 do sum dirt

CHORUS (2X)

Nobody move, nobody get hurt.... (8X)
