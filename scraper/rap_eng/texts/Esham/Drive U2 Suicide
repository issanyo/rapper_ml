[INTRO]
Once I get inside your head...

(SAMPLES)
"We going to probably get killed trying to be like somebody else."
"Yes, yes y'all (y'all)"
"And you don't stop (stop)"
(repeats)

[VERSE 1]
Once I start up my mind
Get in, let's take a spin
Let me drive you to suicide
I'm gone with the wind
I'm out my mind
And my mind travels through space and time
If you find me you see me
You can't 'cause you're blind
I deceive like Adam and Eve
You can't believe
That I made the rhythm breathe
Your eardrums bleed
In time, you will find I'm out my mind
But you don't know
'Cause if you knew me
You would know for 'sho
So let me drive you to suicide

[HOOK]
"Keep it on, (on) and shockin' the place"
"Keep it on, keep it on (on) and shockin' the place"
Let me drive you to suicide
(repeats)

[VERSE 2]
Once I decide that
I don't want to live no more
Well I guess I got to do
What the Devil tells me to
Voodoo, it's kind of Wicket
Really wonder how I'm going under
Can you feel the pain
When it rains and it starts to thunder
I don't really know where I got to go
Heaven or Hell, either or
It don't matter once your brain's scattered
Once you cock the hammer
Come along for the ride
I'll see you on the other side
And let me drive you to suicide

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Pop goes the weasel
Shotgun blasted
Hole in my head
Funeral, closed casket
Dead body laying on the bathroom floor
So I don't got to worry about the pain no more
