[VERSE 1]
Once upon a time I was broke and hungry
I told you that before so let me get on with my story
I chill in Detroit on the East side of town
I can remember when niggas screamed "Pony Down!"
Times have changed so I've changed with the times
Many didn't know I was always rocking rhymes
Some bitches was illing
Spilling and spitting out venom
I'm cool and casual so I don't wear denim
And call me fake
And weak and wack and worthless
Now I'm blocking, dropped this legit
And so I'm fresh, yes
Change your tune, soon you'll be a fan
And everywhere you go you got my dick in your hand
I used to be fake, that's what you told your crew
So now when they see me they jock too
Oh...
Let me get it straight
I'm just a joke ya'll was playing
In fact you really didn't know what you were saying
And slipping, you're tripping off my lifestyle
Cause I'm funky fresh cool and never wild
So all ya'll hoes grab my tip and get a good grip
Before you fix your lip to diss
Don't trip

[VERSE 2]
You used to tell me like a 40 but you never swallow me
And everywhere I go it seems the rumors would follow me
Said I suck up, setup, and stickup
Ruining my rep hoping yours might pick up
He say, she say, you say I'm fake
Give me a break, what does it take to make
You understand jealousy ain't hitting
Niggas think they did
But they didn't cause they're bullshitting
Hoes on the sidelines reading the headlines
Before I was fake, now I'm they man, they all lyin'
Trying to replace me with rumors and a bad rep
Fuck the rumors
I'm quiet as kept and I step
Calling me broke, saying I'm a joke, and all hope
That they was me so they could see how E living
I'm living swell as hell
Brother can't you tell
I stay calm and cool
Smooth, will never yell
My mind is worth a million dollars
But I won't sell it
I'm going to Tell It Like It Is
That's the only way to tell it
I'm ice, brother
Watch your step, don't slip
Before you wind up on your ass
Don't trip

[VERSE 3]
You act like your basing on the real deal
Said the only thing I buy at McDonald's is a kiddy meal
How you figure
Another pussy ass nigga
Tripping off my fame, yo your name's Jack tripper
I had to let them know I'm the best in the city, ho
You're tripping like a man in too drunk video
You said I was faker than a 3 Dollar bill, son
Your mom's so fake, you got change for 1
Niggas ain't the only ones tripping
Hoes tripping too
To the fake phony bitches, fuck you
Talking behind my back
Telling your girl what I ain't got
Telling them how I'm this
And telling them how I'm that
Well tell them how I fucked you
And tell them how you sucked, ooh!
It felt so good bitch you ought to do it again
For the next time ya'll talking
Ya'll better not be tripping on me
Cause ya'll can suck my dick
Don't T-R-I-P
