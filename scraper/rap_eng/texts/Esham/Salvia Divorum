[Verse 1:]

Woke up this morning with a brand new attitude
I was filled with joy and gratitude
There’s no way to describe it but if could
I was feeling good; I was feeling good good
Sun shining barbeque I smell it in the air
California love the girls I wish that I was there
Riding down sunset in a drop top
Fat burgers seen the cops at Randy’s doughnut shop
And I’m going to cruise up the coast down in Malibu
See some French vanilla chicks I be like comment allez-vous (“how are you”)
Cause they out there on the beach they getting them a sun tan
It’s a gang of girls out here but I was only one man

[Hook:]

And I’m feeling good good good , feeling so good good good
Cause I’m feeling good good good , feeling so good good good
And I’m feeling good

[Verse 2:]

We be so fresh
TGIF thank God it’s Friday
Pay day is my day
I’m picking you up, and taking you out
Throw on that new dress, oh girl yeah you fresh
Looking so good, they so envious
Yeah we make them all believers
We Loving all the divas
Tens, twenty’s, fifty’s, hundreds, you got it if you want it
Yeah you know we run it, y’all already done it
(Y’all already done it)

[Hook:]

Cause she looking good good good, looking good good good
Cause she looking good good good, looking good good good
She looking good
