Yo, check this out...

[VERSE 1]
Now some people say that I'm too nasty
The ones that don't know
I say, "Yeah", when they ask me
The freakiest brother on the planet
Sometimes I don't even understand it, God damn it
Young ladies, young bitches, young hoes
Mack on your ho, it's how it goes
So here goes nothing
All ya'll hoes know what time it is
You know my dick
So you know what kind of rhyme it is
I get ill on the mic, but still
I don't like (???), but like the Real Feel
I'm not Luther Vandross or Freddie Jackson
Some freaks be askin', why I be taxin'
I don't know, that's the kind of brother I am
If your father don't think I'm going to fuck you
Tell your mother I am
I'm the freaky-deak brother on the give it up tip
For those who know of me
This is erotic poetry

[VERSE 2]
Now I'm the K-I-S-S-I-N-G-B-A-N-D-I-T
E-S-H-A-M is on the M-I-C
Now I make the kind of poetry to make you wanna get with me
All the hoes say,"Please won't you hit me?"
I'm not Casanova, Esham's in the joint
I make the fuck songs that get straight to the point
I don't make love songs cause I don't do that
And if I bust a wack rap like that
You'll say, "Who's that?"
So won't the hoes admit it
I let the rhythm hit them and they loved the way I did them
I get freak bones, bust nuts on G-bones
Hoes give the jaw bone when we're all alone
So I don't understand when you say I'm a nasty man
You should be saying nasty ho
Cause I like to do it slow
So I like to hit you like a man would
I like to fuck, I like to fuck it like a man should, yo
This goes out to the hoes who know of me
Trashy, but still classy
Erotic poetry

[VERSE 3]
Now when I say bitch or ho I don't mean no disrespect
But the name Esham you'll never forget
So all you hoes gather 'round while I break it down
Esham's in the house and I'm the talk of the town
Now some hoes think I exaggerate with the ink
But if you stop and think
How do I know your pussy's pink
I've got a dirty mind and I love hoes
But my idea of love is different from yours
And my love goes wham, bam, thank you, ma'am
When you wake up I'm gone and all you can say is, "Damn!"
He love me like, he love me like, he love me like no other
And when I left your crib, I went to go and fuck your mother
I'll do anything to please you
Anything you want me to do
Just ask, and I'll eat you
This goes out to those that know of me
Trashy, but still classy
Erotic poetry

[VERSE 4]
Now I've got game like Parker Brothers
Play Monopoly on top of me, while we do each other
Roll a dice on your chest, I hit seven, I won
By the time I roll eleven, I bet you'll cum
When you get past go, you'll get a fuck free card
And a guarantee that all night the dick will stay hard
Just for you, run back, side to side
'Til you cum 'til you can't cum no more, from inside
If you say I'm nasty, you hoes should grow up
Cause I'll do things to you that will make the average man throw up
Like push the bush and cut the grass with the mower
Lick it up high, then lick it down lower
A shame, ain't no shame to my game
Cause you only live once and telling lies is lame
So I'll be mean to the people who know of me
Still getting pussy from the ladies
