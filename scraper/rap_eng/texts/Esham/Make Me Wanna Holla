[INTRO]
The Wicketshit continues
After I told these niggas to stay off my dick
They still on my dick tryin' to bite the Wicketshit
Niggas still wanna know what Esham mean
Esham stands for East Side, Hoes And Money
That's what I'm all about
But for all ya'll niggas bitin' the Wicketshit
And tryin' to bite the style
I want you to think about one thing...

Remember me?
The one you got'cha idea from

Back in this bitch
Yo, for the 9-4
I gotta let these niggas know once again
That I'm comin' like this
They said the Wicketshit was dead
Some ol' Wicketshit ain't never dead
I gotta let y'all hoes know I'm comin' back on yo ass

[VERSE 1]
I stopped believing in God about a year ago
In God I can't trust, but uh, you don't hear me though
'Cause my life in the sunshine ain't sunny
A Suicidalist
My memory's on the blitz
But can you really dig what I dug if I drug
The life of a thug caught a .45 slug
I wish I was dead
But I'm fucked up in the head
Cause I'm kinda hesitant to kill myself
But I hate life
Life ain't nothin' but money
And it ain't funny when your honey gets runny
I wish I was down but my mind spins round and around
And how many times can dead bodies be found
But you don't understand the tales of a madman
Unholy comin' at your ass once again
Amen, and I don't give a fuck though
Sometimes I feel like giving up yo
It makes me wanna holla

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
It makes me wanna holla
Life comes in dollars
Doin' dirt like ring around the collar
I'll uh, can't get paid if I ain't got a trade
I dropped out of school, now who got played?
A fool, I'm just tryin' to get mine
I'm sick of seein' my moms in the welfare line
A nigga, I grew up in the ghetto
I live in the ghetto
I'm never gonna get out the ghetto
The place where black folks die
And slangin' them cracks is a way to get by
There's nothin' else a nigga can do
And fuck the police because they only protect you
You wouldn't understand unless you was a black man
God damn
It makes me wanna holla

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I'm still feelin' funny ways
On them sunny days
When my honey plays the money stays
Days go by and things seem to get no better
Now the bitch wanna leave, I let her
I don't sweat her 'cause it ain't in my nature
Bringing out the worst in me, I think I hate ya
I can't deal with it ho
I gotta stay real with it though, swole, yo
My mind's spinnin' cause I'm drinkin' that gin and juice
Tryin' to forget about you, bitch
You can call me crazy
When every other nigga in the ghetto is a crack baby
Maybe one day I'll be dead
Bleedin' in the sunshine, hole in my head
That's all a nigga need
Fuck a bitch, stankin' ass pussy always wanna bleed
I don't need that ho
Not in my life, not now yo, no
It makes me wanna holla

[HOOK]

[VERSE 4]
It makes me wanna holla
'Cause life ain't nothin' but a joke
Down in the ghetto
Smellin' the gunsmoke
When every other bitch is on this dick
I'm trying not to be a statistic
It's hard, I can't get a job
Mo' niggas robbin'
I'm steady mobbin'
They tell a nigga to look on the bright side
It ain't the black side, must be the white side
I gotta watch my back in case cops wanna act up
Get ya punk ass smacked up
'Cause I know you wanna kill me
'Cause I know yo ass feel me
It makes me wanna holla

[HOOK]
