[INTRO]
Hey man have you ever met the perfect bitch, man?
(Yeah!)
But you know...
You know, I met the perfect bitch
And I thought she was something, man
(For real?)
She is something
She's a bitch, man, that's what she is!
(Haha, alright, she's a bitch then, that's what she is.)

[VERSE 1]
Well I met this girl
I was dazy, crazy for the ho
The bitch took my feelings and phased me, I know
I should have watched my back but I didn't, so
My hate for the ho begins to grow
I met her a month ago
It wasn't about money though
As far as I could see her personality was cool
So I talked and talked
My intention was to bone her
But I found myself liking her
And being all up on her
She teased me with the pussy
Had my mind in the Twilight Zone
It was like dial-a-porn whenever we talked on the phone
I'm asking her "What's up, when're you going to let me hit it?"
She said "Right now, I'm hot and horny, hurry come and get it!"
I reached her house in a minute
I was all up in it
First time I ever fucked her
Damn it was splendid
The bitch had my mind going loop de loop
I was pussy-whipped up like Grandma's soup
Had me in a state of shock while she was riding my jock
Sweat dripped off my balls 'cause the walls was hot
She was sucking me and fucking me like the freak on the flick
Then I sucked on her titties while she rode my dick
She said "Please be gentle, hold me don't let go."
And all I was thinking was "Fuck her, OHHH!"
Bear with me brothers
I dont know what I was thinking of
I'm thinking how could making fuck turn out to making love
Slowly as I fucked her, she called me Harry
She called Charles, Earl, James, and Larry
I took three more strokes and then bust a nut
Come to find out my dream girl was just a slut
The freak of the week
I didn't stop to think
How many's made you scream, girl
Nasty dream girl

[HOOK]
Dream girl, dream girl, fuckin nasty dream girl
Dream girl, dream girl, sucking dick dream girl
Dream girl, dream girl, ho-ey ass dream girl
You's just a bitch, dream girl
(x2)

You's just a bitch, girl
I hate you, bitch!
