[Verse 1]
This is how it's going down
Mechanic Motown
So sleazy
It ain't easy being cheesy
Used to be my boo-boo
Now ya just doo-doo
Milky brown like a Yoo-Hoo
Once upon a time did a crime in America
With the 17-shot Glock Austria
Plus crush burn a hole in my new fashion
Blaze it pedal to the metal mashin'
Down 7 M-I-L-E, helly
Picked up another bitch straight to the telly
Bitch booty butter soft like a Pelle
Plus hush crush sticky green of the smelly
Straight bombin on niggas like an Israeli
Rarely playin this game of life fairly
Merrily merrily life is but a dream
In my nightmare my boat rows down a bloody stream
Infrared beams follow me wherever I go
At night close my eyes, total dark as The Crow
Triple 6 got me wishing I was Heaven sent
The East Side is hell, ho
That's where I represent
Bloody money got my life unfolding
Shit's startin'
Niggas go crazy like Martin
I'm out my mind in this bitch on the daily
For the dogs looking at me foaming at the mouth with rabies
I got a message for the thugs
Get plugged
Get your grave dug
Get your bloody body drug
You know my title is:
Suicidalist
With the chrome in my fist
I don't miss
It's the E to the S to the H-A-M
And I heard you tell somebody you was hatin' him
But the simple fact is you can't relate to them
Nigga's cash come quicker than an ATM
Way too grim
Bitch get smacked with the TEC-9
When I holla out Reel Life, best respect mine
Crime is life, and life is crime
But what would life be without a Reel Life rhyme?
Niggas Ahead of Time And Space
Can't be erased
Or replaced
With more shit to face
Dead body after dead body
Case after case
Still keep the toolie tucked down in my waist
For the radio disc jock I might pop
17 in ya body til ya fall off the charts
Cause the trigger gots no heart

King of hearts
King of hearts
