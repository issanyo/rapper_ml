[VERSE 1]
My life in the sunshine
The sun don't shine too much on mine
But I feel funny ways on sunny days
Honey plays, money pays, but must it keep her in a daze?
Used to be my baby
But now you're just a Bebe Kid
And I'm thinkin' about the things I did
Just to make you happy
Scoob get Scrappy, but listen to the nappy pappy
It's all about money
It's all about mo' money and it's gettin mo' funny
In the sunny days I think about my Wicked ways
Juicy's got me crazed so crime pays
Puttin' in work, doing my dirt
And I'm the one that ends up gettin' hurt
Just for a piece of puss, a piece of bush
And now the next man's gettin' the tush
I guess I'll know next time
But for now I'm just losin' my mind
Cause I'm caught up in the sunshine

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
In the sunshine
I'm feelin' kind of mellow
Watch the crackheads say "hello"
I'm just a little ghetto boy, ghetto child
Runnin' wild with the freestyle
I dropped out of school to clock papers
Now when the niggas see me, they clock vapors
Watchin' them Daytons hit the sunlight
Jealous niggas, so I hold my gun tight
Everybody out to get me
You see, my minds playin' tricks with me, so don't bullshit me
I used to have some homies
But see I dissed all my homies so now I'm kind of lonely
But it's all about me
But it's too hard for me to see through my jealousy
A nigga caught me slippin' at a red light
Two shots to my dome, now I'm dead right
Nigga bleedin' in the broad daylight
Through thick and thin, homies should stay tight
That's all I was thinkin' bout
With my brains blew out
In the sunshine

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
In the sunshine
Niggas feel good
Smokin' herbs, chillin' in the hood
Shoot a little dice, fuck a little ho
And then some nigga tried to rob the liquor sto'
They shot him in the back on the way out
Like a sucker
What a way to go out
Tried to steal some bread to feed his babies
Basehead crack baby, neighborhood crazies
Now I guess the babies don't eat
Bloody basehead dad dead in the street
And it ain't no rainbows
Where the cocaine flows
The night train goes
Straight to the graveyard
That's where you go when you try to behave hard
I guess he'll know next time
But his babies losin' they mind
In the sunshine

[HOOK]
