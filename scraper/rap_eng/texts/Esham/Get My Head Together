I hear voices in my head
My head hears voies
So many choices
I'm coming down off a bad trip
And I'm sick of the bullshit
It ain't my fault
It's all my fault
Who's fault is it
It doesn't matter
Can you understand
I live the life of a mad man
I'm a psycho
Suicidal
Not Michael
Like a motorcycle
I can't understand myself
Man I need help
Who am I
Am I
Who you though I was
It's not too bad cause
I ain't trippin'
Naw I'm trippin'
Cause yall be trippin'
You don't know me
How you goin' know me
When I don't know me
I try to get to know myself
Self knowledge and tell myself
They're all gonna laugh at me
I gotta get my head together
It's the new style
I gotta get my head straight
I'm loosin' my mind
I'm giving you a peice of my mind
I got something on my mind
One time but hey nevermind
I'm loosin' my sense
I got no sence
No nonsense
More dollars than cents
Since I'm dyin'
The world may never know if I'm lyin'
Lying in my grave
Hey I think I need a shave
What's my name
Who stole my brain
Who should I blame
Blame it on the boogie
Blame it on the rain
I can feel your pain
I'ma say
Hey I forgot what I'ma say
Who, What, When, Where, Why, How
I gotta get my head together
I gotta get my head together
I gotta get my head together
I gotta get my head together
I gotta get my head together
I gotta get it straight
I gotta get it straight
I can't really wait
I can't really wait for my mind
Make up my mind
I'm loosin' my mind
So do you mind
I don't mind
If you don't mind
Cause what's yours is mine
But I need my own
You know what I'm sayin' holmes
You don't know
Cause I don't know
So, kick that hey
My name's Esham
Slit your wrist
Drink a orange juice
Hellalujah
Suck my dick
What's it to ya
I'm from no where
I'm commin' straight outta' no where
And goin' no where
More broke more broke
More coke for the fiends to smoke
Come get me
Lock me up
I don't give a fuck
I gotta get my head together
Man I'm back
I'm the black devil
And it that ain't no joke
What's up
Who's playin that beat
I'm commin' through in the back seat
Cheap shots
Cheap tricks
But you can suck on my toe
Hey ho you know
That I'm the black bro
I still don't know where I come from
Lick my balls 'till my dick's numb
Dum ditty dum ditty dum dum
Redrum
I feel like a redrum
E-S-H-A-M
Why I'm talkin' 'bout him
Is that me
You can't see what I can see
Man whatever
I gotta get my head together
If buttholes were peep shows and the nigs
And the window of the soul
Of this fucking ridiculous world
Analities got nothing on the worlds
Except a signed royality check
Forged signature
The toilet swipe
The maggot acid smile
The glitch in the universal way, yeah
A real boss abortion to brag about at your next BBQ
