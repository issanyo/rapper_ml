[Intro]
"Fuck, man...I hate myself, man."
"My life is fucked up, man."
"I just need to slit my wrist, man."
"I just wish I was dead."

[Verse 1]
Son of a bitch
Jason wants to slit his wrists
But I'll tell you like this
Shouldn't take the risk
Knowing the consequences well
The suicidal suckers end up in Hell
Some rather be dead than living instead
Cause the planet is fucked up and misled
By fools like you
Running 'round telling motherfuckers what they can and can't do
Butterflies in my stomach
Make me want to vomit cause I know Doomsday is coming
Jason's facin' life or death
It's do or die
And as he takes a deep breath he wonders who will cry
The only one who really cares is you and I
But you're the only one who really knew why
Life's a bitch from beginning to end and then you die
Living the life of sin, and why
I can see it in your eyes I'm not surprised
As you cross your heart and hope to die

[Various Samples]

[Verse 2]
Living your life on the edge of panic
Still you're manic
Cause you was born a schizophrenic
Never knew life was a bitch, but it is so hard
I'm living low in the graveyard
Take a trip to another side, another place
Lying in a casket with a dead man's face
Who gives a fuck about you, nobody but you
But I didn't have to tell you that
Cause that's something you already knew
Just like a razor to the wrist I'm going to cut you quick
Last dying words is, "I'm a son of a bitch!"
Son of a gun and I've just begun to bleed
As I scream Jesus Christ I fall to my knees
And as everyone cries they wonder why
I crossed my heart and hoped to die

[Various Samples]

[Verse 3]
My rhyme is like a 9 to the forehead
And once you push play, you'll pull the trigger and now you're dead
A suicidal, homicidal, homicidal, suicidal recital
Is what I recite when I'm on the mic
At midnight I'll smother you like crib death
And find my record spinning
You'll never knew I was grinning when I did that
This is the U-N-H-O-L-Y
Deadly like pesticide
So just step aside
Once I knew a little girl was playin' my tape on Sunday
They found her in some headphones dead on Monday
Hanging from a chandelier
The only thing to fear is fear
When you get them butterflies you know the Unholy is near
Some disappear and never be found
Some are smothered by the rhythm and then drowned
And when I blow your mind your won't know why
You'll soon cross your heart and hope to die
