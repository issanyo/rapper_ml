[VERSE 1]
Spring forward, fall back
New coupe, all black
The dead of winter
And these rappers still wack
In fact I'mma blow up on the track
Like a suicide bomber
Roll around through Iraq
Instead I'm in Detroit
East Side, Beirut
When the thermostat drop
They cock, squeeze, and shoot
They out cold
Salute, army fatigues, and boots
I'm General Motors
And you all new recruits
First mission on the streets
Get you some big heat
And be prepared for war
Never retreat
We're headed for Armageddon
I'm bleedin' like I'm sweatin'
The end of the world as we know it
Don't be forgettin'
I'm locked and loaded
Got the cannons exploded
Leave your body in the ground
Decomposed and corroded
The Wicket rhyme, yeah I wrote it
So quotable that they quote it
Watch me walk on water
(?) away then I floated
It's a cold day in Hell
'Cause all the devils
Make you hot up here
And everybody wondering
How they gettin' shot up here
Even the angels up in Heaven
Say they got up there
Revelations, Last Days
If you not aware

[VERSE 2]
On a cold Winter's day
The slush turn to ice
And that's why my heart
Been cold all my life
When the temperature drop
My heartbeat stop
Be a cold day in Hell
I give a fuck about a cop
Do it for TNT
And all my niggas on the block
Pop, pop
Piggity, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop
Piggity, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop
Piggity, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, Pop

[VERSE 3]
Temperatures fallin'
Voices be callin' me Black Ice
They say don't slip around me
Pussy, yeah, watch your lips around me
I'm out cold
Frozen ass and tits around me
How you finna shine
In the Wintertime
When there's wolves out here
And it's dinnertime
On a cold winter's day
Blood stains on my pants
I can feel the frostbite
Start to tingle on my hands
I cannot hold my knife no more
She tellin' me it tickles
Told me slide it 'cross her throat
Until I see her blood trickle
She couldn't get enough
She asked if could we make a snuff
She wanted me to beat her
With a hose and tie her up
Said, "Get some gasoline"
'Cause it excited her
And next thing you know
She struck a match and lit a fire up
