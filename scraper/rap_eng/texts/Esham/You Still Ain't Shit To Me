[INTRO:  ALL]
Bruce Wayne
Moebadis, I'm back at this
Original goodfellas
TNT is in this bitch
Check it out

[VERSE 1:  MOEBADIS]
I serve Clarks and Kents
I'm packing heat in events
My nigga Esham, and T
Equals slugs in your chest
So you best to jet
Nigga, we wild like the west
Flex, we flex
Trick bitches can suck a dick
Heads get split
Classical ass whips for niggas who talk shit
I'm letting my 9 spit
I'm always on the grind bitch
(Esham:  Moebadis, back at this)
Niggas thought I gave up the motherfucking rhyming
But back in that ass for another fuck
When I get you, nigga
You better duck

[VERSE 2:  ESHAM]
Well it's them killers that rhyme
And fuck the hoes
You might see me rolling a convertible Rolls
I washed off my dick cause I fucked your bitch
I'm underground baby, and won't ever switch
So excellent
Accurate like a sharpshooter
Kilo shopping, O-Z chopping
This is for the niggas who be real with their shit
Ho ass niggas so illegit
I just want to clock cash and rock the mic
It ain't the Devil's son in law or Dolemite
I got a ho in Atlanta, says she Funkdafied
Bitch's pussy so big she's nationwide
Boy I tell you motherfuckers in the world ain't shit
So many fake motherfuckers, their counterfeit
What you saying boy
You wanna get with me
Big bank take little bank
You still ain't shit to me
Still ain't shit to me
Still ain't shit to me
Still ain't shit to me

[VERSE 3:  TNT]
Well it's the microphone master
Crashing the party
Swerving on the freeway
Drunk off Bacardi
You better get your bitch cause I'm a hog about it
And if you think I fucked her
Bitch, don't doubt it
I still move them bigs in the 'hood on the regular
Million dollar deal
Making moves on my cellular
I don't give a fuck if your ho don't dance
I always wear Adidas
Screaming fuck your man
It's the T, it's the T
Motherfucker it's T
I'm down with Moe, (Bite?), and Masta-M-I-N-D
Copping a quarter key
From the police I flee
Busting shots at my enemies
Cause you bitches ain't shit to me
