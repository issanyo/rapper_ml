[Verse 1:  Esham]
I'm ice skatin' through my city in my 8-5-0
Just got the V.S.O.P. from the 'sto
'Bout to pick up this bitch and we gon' trip
Baby we can get nasty like the porno flick
'Cause if  I pimp, or gigolo
I'm gettin' so much mail I don't need a ho
You can break yourself but you can't break me
The J-A-Y or the R-L-P
Now what you hear is not a test
We call it ganz, you call it sess
Some call it chronic, some call it reefer
But if you smoke the shit then it gets much deeper
Now I'm Esham, your mama's man
If your daddy can't fuck her right, bitch I can
If your best friend fucked your boyfriend
Tell that bitch to go do it again
If your nigga trips, and he always talks shit
And he definitely is the wack
You can tell that ho-ass nigga Esham said get back
And all I heard was

[Hook]
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothing that you can do
Lay back, unwind, and let the rhythm get into you
You better ask somebody if you don't know
You better ask somebody if you don't know

[Verse 2:  TNT]
You betta ask somebody if you don't know me
I go by the name of TNT
I slang my rocks on Saratoga
I'm trying to get bank like Lee Iacocca
I'm down with E and Mastamind
So niggas out there can't fuck with mine
I stepped into the place like a movie star
I jumped out of that big, badass car
I roll with them niggas with the Glocks and MACs
And every nigga's mind on his Hundred stacks
So fuck that nigga that you with tonight
'Cause he ain't talking 'bout shit tonight

[Verse 3:  Mastamind]
Tonight's the night, the sky's the limit
Big black Benz and the windows tinted
Look inside, a player's in it
Long as the money comes I got time to spend it
Get fresh, hit the streets, flex
Young freaks get at me, I wonder what ho's next
Big bank attracts the opposite sex
They want the cash in hand and not the checks
No American Express, Visa, MasterCard
They hawk so hard when I pass the boulevard
Ridin' high, raise the window, blaze the indo
And get up on this info in case you ain't know, so

[Hook]
You better ask somebody if you don't know
You better ask somebody if you don't know

[Verse 4:  Drunken Master]
Well if you don't know now ya know, nigga
The Drunken, The Master
I'm 'bout to pull the trigger on the remix
Representin' Reel Life
Stabbin' up trife livin' bitches with a butcher knife
Now who is this on the roof bustin' shots
Dre, E, and the niggas from the block called Cadillac
House of Rep got it locked
Gettin' props, so just wait until the album drops
My nigga E, represent The D
Get on the mic and show these bitches the pedigree

[Verse 5:  Esham]
And I'm the ladies choice
I smokes the best
I run down a rhyme at your request
And with the platinum voice I'm so precise
My 35-point is shinin' just like ice
I'm from the bottom to the top
The top to the bottom
Three-piece Lorenzo's, oh I just got 'em
On the big Benz
Millionaire Bruce Wayne still stack 'ends
I'm overseas gettin' ten
And ain't no nigga frontin' me no keys
I ride with the mob and I clock the Gs
The titty bar hoes be on they knees
Just to get a look at these big N-U-Ts
I'm Esham, bitch, your mama's man
And can't no nigga do it like I can, and

[Hook]
You better ask somebody if you don't know
You better ask somebody if you don't know
You better ask somebody if you don't know
You better ask somebody if you don't know
