[VERSE 1]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
A suicidal brother must take a fall
Can I talk for a second to myself
Can I talk for a second to myself
Can I look into my eyes, for a second
Take a second look into my eyes
I'm not surprised at what I see
I see you staring right back at me
So I'm going to take a chance
Take a razor to my wrist
Take a rest
Take me a razor from the medicine chest
But I hesitate to take myself out my misery
I got to get my head together
Or whatever
I'm going to do
I've got to do it right now
Cause I'm a Suicidalist and I know how
Life ain't nothing but bitches and money
So "Elizabeth, I'm coming to join you honey"
Can I get Wicket
Get Wicket, can I get
I'm losing my mind
I can't take this shit
I think I'm going to do it
Going to do it man I think
I bet by tomorrow dead bodies might stink
13 Ways how to do it man I know
But if I got to go, I guess I got to go
I'm still dreaming about death
And every day is like dead
I got a screw loose and a hole in my head
Tick-tock and you don't stop
Fuck the motherfucking cops
Man, I'm thinking all this crazy shit
I grip my dick
Damn...
