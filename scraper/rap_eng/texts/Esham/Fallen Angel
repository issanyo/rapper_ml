[VERSE 1]
I was an unplanned pregnancy
Brought forth by a mistake
Born into a world
Filled up with lust and hate
Little do I know about life
But I'm still learnin'
First I must journey
Through Hell without burnin'
Livin' in the ghetto
The Devil is now a black man
I saw him standin' on the corner
With the crack man
Little do I know
This Hell is now my home
Since birth
The peace I've known is now gone
Life to death, days passed
I'm still growin'
Death is my fate in this Hell
But never knowin' when
But how do I survive without sin
But "Thou shalt not kill" was my first
Then I broke all Ten Commandments
I guess I'm doomed to go to Hell
But I'm already there
So tell another tale
From the dark side of myself
I'm entangled
Between Heaven and Hell
I'm a Fallen Angel

"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!"

[VERSE 2]
18 years passed
Never knew about love
The sky is fallin'
So I fell from the Heavens above
Product of your sins
My father, I never knew him
Call the Exorcist
'Cause the Devil done got to him
Voodoo Child
Son of bitch, some bastard
Sold my soul
And now I'm the master
My mother sings the Blues
And drinks the booze
And then she prays
To save my soul from bad news
Tears fall
I hear my mother call on the Lord
At night I be playin' in my room
On a Ouija board
Screamin' redrum at the top of my lungs
When I close my eyes
Visions of bodies bein' hung
Death was my destiny
Life was a test to me
Livin' inside my owns sins of blasphemy
Death awaits inside myself
I'm entangled
Between Heaven and Hell
I'm a Fallen Angel

[VERSE 3]
As my soul gets deeper to darkness
Can I be saved
My life flash before my eyes
In many ways
I saw me in my earlier days
And wicked ways
"Cross my heart and hope to die"
Is on my grave
Written on my tombstone
Rest in peace
Rottin' body in the ground
As the maggots feast
You see I lived so fast
And died so young
Another victim of another brother
Drinkin' his redrum
I'm fallin' from the Heavens
And I'm on my way
To meet the maker, the Undertaker
'Cause now it's Judgment Day
My soul is hot
And my body is all rotten
Another angel falls from the heavens, forgotten
Without a clue nobody knew
The knowledge to teach me
'Cause uh, fuck the teacher
And fuck the preacher
As my soul will perish inside myself
I'm entangled
An outcast from the Heavens
So I'm a Fallen Angel
