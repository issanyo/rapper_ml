[VERSE 1]
I be the nigga with the .357 chrome plated
America's most player hated and frustrated
Suicide's still on my mind, I contemplate it
Murdered more niggas, dead bodies, premeditated
Born and brought up in Detroit and street educated
Everything I do in this life is still drug related
Do my dirt by my lonely, so nigga I'm isolated
Many motherfuckers wanna see me incarcerated
Check the condition, stiff body in position
Body bag bloody from my murder composition
Niggas on suspicion, get 'em broke like New Edition
Peep the transmission from the street politician
Pop, pop, pop, to the dome, off the 'Lac Brougham
Chrome still shinin' and I'm grinnin' cuz my mind's gone
Murder, murder, murder's all I scream when I squeeze Glocks
Number one way to kill a thug when the slug's hot
I'm yellin' out die!

[HOOK]
Die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die
I'm yellin' out die!
Die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die
I'm yellin' out die!
Die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die
I'm yellin' out die!
Die, die, die, die, die, die
Die, die, die, die, die, die

[VERSE 2]
I come from the place where every nigga got a dope case
Scrappin' for five dollas at night I hear nigga's holla
All in my head, these bloody visions of my city streets
That's why when I roll, keep the gat on the front seat
Niggas'll murder me if I let 'em 'cause they jealous, hoe
Fuck what you heard, I be dope like a half a bird
Schizophrenic, manic, the shit is senseless
All I wanna do is see you bleed, 'cause I'm relentless
The days of grace have long passed in the aftermath
Wickedest ways, turn your cities into blood baths
Manic depressive, I'm the nigga with the death wish
Snitch on me I'll put a slug in your esophagus
Don't fuck around if you can't stand the consequence
Detroit niggas'll make your punk ass past tense
All in my head, been suicidal since my date of birth
Nigga's been plottin' to murder me, but I murder first
I'm yellin' out die!

[HOOK]
