Esham's dope hoe, dig the flow
No showin' where the story'll go
Muthafuckas scared of him like he Anthrax Man
Cause they all caught up in the show
Mad years deep in the underground
Spittin' hideous, wickedest rhymes
FBI be always by
He be stretchin' them constitutional lines
Everybody always thinkin' he be voodoo head shrinkin' out with Lucifer
And them was gettin' old
So he closed the casket on the Devil shit
And let new inner rages explode
Acid Rain, and truth in explain and that he only tried to entertain
And it ain't his fuckin' fault you lit your head on fire and you went insane over the shit
