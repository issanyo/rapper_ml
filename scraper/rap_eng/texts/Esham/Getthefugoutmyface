Esham:
1st verse
When i wake up in the morning i got to puff the gan
A pocket full of money saying IM THE MAN
Got a bitch on my line im gonna fuck today cause i didn't
Get a chance to yesterday
Ima hit the buzz spot and cop a bag of true
No im bout to tell you what i fina do
Ima call this bitch set this date see if i can come fuck
Before eight
And if i can come fuck, bust a nut, all day i be talking
Bout nigga what
I got a homie in jail doing life for sure for living in detroit making it
Snow
Got a nigga on the west side buying my o'z, behind closed doors he
Sniffs it in his nose
Want to be like scarface sniffing the white im fucking this niggas bitch all last night
And she telling how the nigga ain't fucked her right, telling me all the news like Walter Kronkite
I said look here bitch i ain't your man, the shits played out like dapper dan
And if you looking for love you end up wrong place
Get your panties out your ass and get the fuck out my face

2nd verse
First thing that i learned when i got in the game
Was never talk down on a player's name
Like steve russel and white boy rick got the fbi all on my dick
Im a young ass nigga with lots of loot, the aligotor boots and ain't afraid to shoot
If you bitch on my line nigga i did that cause all hoes recognize me as the mac
I dont care who tell i want to do the brat, pull th ebitch brains and fuck her from the back
I want to smoke me a blunt with cheech and chong, niggas get fucked up all night long
I want a check on friday to buy some boones a fresh pair of khakis and some fruit of the looms
Take me out the hood but not the hood out me
An oz began and some hennesey
See i dont give a fuck you dont like my rhyme
A nigga like me high all the time
And we all know it ain't no time to waist
Imma just tell you GET THE FUCK OUT MY FACE
