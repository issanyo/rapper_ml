[Answering machine]
(beep) Then you know what you can do
You can be a couple of pleasers
And take some tweezers
And bust every hair on my nutsack
Paste em to your back
Then jump on the E-Track
And suck my dick exactly where it's at....HO
(beep)

[Old record plays]
Yay for the clown!
Yay for the clown!
Yay for the clown!
Yay for the clown!

[Low voice repeats]
Juggles
Juggles
Juggles
Juggles (x2)

[Violent J]
Hey, Hey it's the wicked jokers
And we're coming to the valley and we'll smoke ya (choke ya)
Kick the clown in the forehead and I'm juggling juggling your head
(Jed) You big fat redneck muddy ass hick
I'm a city slicker and I'm comin to get ya, hit ya
And the Carnival's gonna get wit' ya
Oh, I might as well mention, that I come from another dimension
You never seen nothing like this boy (Magic axe of pain and joy)
Keystone copper try to get me
But I pack a French curler with me
And the officer let me off quick
Here's a Dunkin double-dip, you fat piece of shit
Picture that (that) packing a magic wand and a top hat
Because somthin' gotta stop
Or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Hook]
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop, Chop
Swing, Swing, Swing, and Chop, Chop [X2]

[Violent J]
Detroit air is toxic, my eyeballs popped out they sockets
And fried in the street like a Steak Umm
(shake em, bake em)
Break em off something from the smoke stack
I've been breathing all my life so I'm dying anyway
I'm nothing but a radiation freak show
My arm fell off and it bounced on the floor
Carnival land up the alley (alley, alley)
And we stoppin in Sunny Valley
(Jumpin up and down on a richie's head)
And now I'm gonna jump till he's finally dead
(Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump, Jump)
They got no love yet they got control
They'll never touch my funky soul
Streets are bullets and chalk
Now we can run or we can walk
Either way some gotta stop
Or the wicked clowns are gonna chop, chop

[Hook]

[Esham and Violent J]
[Esham] Wicked Clown, Wicked Clown
[Violent J] What's up comes down
[Esham] Before my nuts go soft juggle em around
[Violent J] Bitch wanna join the carnival circus
Grab my ding-a-ling and jerk and jerk this
[Esham] I gotta catch these carnival thrills rudeboy (*mixed*)
New born babies heads I drill
[Violent J] Chills, thrills, bigots writing wills
An axe to the forehead usually kills
[Esham]
If this ain't hell, I can't tell, hang my body on a cross with some
Rusty nails
If I juggle ya call me a thuggala, I'm a nap burgala, voodoo smuggla
See I got the symptoms of insanity, I'm down with J from the ICP
I'm down with him and he's down with me
So if we gotta chop - C-H-O-P

[Violent J]
Running down the block someone hit me wit' a rock
And my brains all over the street
But I'm a wicked clown and I'm up and down all over this Esham beat

[Esham]
So, so, so if I gotta chop, then I guess I gotta chop
If I chop, then I gotta chop, chop

[Both]
But you could never stop sucker, you could never drop
Wicked clowns cause you know we love to CHOP, CHOP

[Hook] (x2)

Got to be funky
