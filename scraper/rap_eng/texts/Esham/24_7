[INTRO]
Yeah, I gotta let these niggas know once again
There ain't nothin' wicket like this here wicket, Wicketshit
You know what I'm sayin', yeah
So if you didn't catch it the first time
I'm going to hit your ass up like this
Two times on your ass

[VERSE 1]
One nine nine fo'
I'm out for the dough
Fuck a ho
And bitches can't fade me like an afro
My flow is wicket, some doubt what we say
The Unholy, Black Devil, Kunta Kinte
I'm down with NATAS and that Blaz4Me
And niggas can't see me in 3D
I'm comin' at your ass straight from the East side
And I'm in the belly of the beast, right
Niggas don't know the time
I'll put a gun in your mouth
And let the taste blow your mind
Sleepy niggas awake
You faker than a silicone titty with the shakes
I makes more bounce to the motherfuckin' ounce
And Esham's how it's pronounced, bitch
I hit the switch
'Cause I got that shit hooked up
And my shit's pure before it's cooked up
Mo' money, that's what it's all about
Young hoes, it's all about dick in your mouth
Unholy nigga with the Reel Life crew
We talk about real life shit we been through
Fuck the Reverend, 187 and fuck Heaven
'Cause the Wicketshit will never die
I'm doin' it 24/7

[HOOK]
I do it like this ya'll, a like this ya'll
I do it like that ya'll, a like that ya'll
(I'm doin' it 24/7)
4x

[VERSE 2]
More niggas gettin' served
'Cause I'm twice as nice with the verbs
I don't believe in God so fuck what you heard
This ain't no gimmick
So don't mimic my style of rappin'
Niggas can't fuck with my Fleetwood mack, and
Plus I'm phat and
All of that and this and mo'
I'm quick to take your ends and dis your ho
No singin' at my funeral
Just a little somethin' I thought you should know
If your pussy stank, you need some douchin' ho
As I choose my flow up
My mind to blow up, to make you throw up
Jackin' my dick and so what I make it nut, but uh
You better watch the shit as I kick it
My shotgun said Blaz4Me
I'm still wicket, as I stick it
Straight up your ass, and pass the J
Niggas from Detroit don't play, hey
You better raise up
And watch me blaze up
Another cigarette
How hard can another fuckin' nigga get
I'll whip a clip out if you want to trip out
And shut your mouth Reverend
'Cause my dick might slip out, uhhh
I don't give a fuck about Heaven
'Cause the Wicketshit will never die
I'm doin' it 24/7

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I got a suicidal problem
My problem solver is a revolver
My mama wants me to get therapy
I don't involve her
'Cause I'm wicket
I like to kick it like no other
James Smith, yeah that's my brother
I know you heard of him
We like to smother suckers
Unlike them other suckers
We cause a ruckus
Make the police want to buck us
So fuck us, if you want to try
Some nigga said I was dead
But the Wicketshit will never die
I'm comin' straight from the cradle to the grave, ya'll
And motherfucker, I could never be a slave, ya'll
I pack a gat and that's for real though
But see I'm nice with my hands
And plus these fuckin' steel toes
I thought you knew it was just like this
I'm down to the end cause I'm a Suicidalist, yo
Where all my peoples at, East or the West side
North side, South side, homicide
It don't matter, ain't no thang to me
'Cause it's all in D-E-T-R-O-I-T
I stay true to my city
Now ain't that a pity
I chopped off a gangsta ho titty
My attitude's just like Frank Nitti, shitty
All 24/7

[HOOK]

[OUTRO]
This goes out to all my niggas
That's true to the motherfuckin' city, yeah
And ain't nothin', nothin' wicket
Like this here wicket Wicketshit
Ya'll still don't know
