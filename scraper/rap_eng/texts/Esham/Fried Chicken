My heads been hurtin since 83'
Since birth my momma's been afraid of me
I was raised by the streets
I was made to be a young nigga makin cash so easily
I rolled into town full of playas and snitches
Every nigga I know be dyin' for riches
OZ's, 8ths, kilos, and pounds
Nigga just yo ass right out of bounds
7 m-i-l-e's where I ride cause I roll through yo town like suicide
If you see me on the streets gotta bloody pistol
Triple beam OZ's get cut with Crystal
Might come to your town and I'll kill your crew
Put a crack house right next door to you
If I fucked your bitch man its all in the game
I done nutted in her mouth and don't know her name
Might come to your hood with my bad intentions
To fuck all the bitches with the hair extensions
If you see a nigga leanin' to the side in my ride
Just look for the joint in my mouth and you can say I'm fried

(Hook)
You can say I'm fried
You can say I'm fried

I got a traffic violation warrant for my arrest
Two dope cases pending, pleadin' "no contest"
Had to beat a nigga ass at the liquor sto'
Cause he said he wouldn't sell me alcohol no mo'
Fuck that I gotta get my buzz and die
Get high still DWI
What the fuck y'all know about a millionaire?
Gettin money slappin hoes screamin I don't care
I'm the neighborhood crook screamin fuck the hook
I'm the nigga that snatched yo mom's pocket book
Wicked shit, shit don't stop forever
Playa hatas hate me nigga whatever
I be fuckin these hoes since 94'
I'm screamin fuck these tricks in 96'
Real life, ill life, fuckin dykes
Hangin with Dice screamin "what it be like?"
Nigga ridin', high sidin, suicidein, murdaridin'
Nigga

(Hook)

I like money and everything that comes with that
I like pussy and big 'ole asses fat
I like hoes that suck dick at a drop of a dime
Put a gun in yo mouth and let it blow yo mind
Bitch boy, my names Esham for real
Nigga still I'll kill for my dollar bills
So real, I'm out for the fortune and game
Street politics, tricks, to cocaine
Sittin' in a crack house earnin' my snaps
Way before I was bustin the raps
It's the c-o-c-a-i-n-e now my lyrics be dope on the m-i-c
So fuck what you heard about me before
I'm the same ol' nigga
Esham's dope, hoe
