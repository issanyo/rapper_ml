[Intro (Talking)]
I'd like to take this time right now, to talk to my momma...
Momma, I know, you know, we ain't been seeing eye to eye
And I know, I been that headache, you know, the black sheep of the family
Momma, even though I'm not on this earth, even though I'm not in a physical form momma
I want you to know i will always be with you momma
I will always be with you mentally momma


[Hook]
One day I'mma die, momma don't cry
Ain't no heaven up in the sky
One day I'mma fade away
And set the world on fire, watch the sky turn grey
(x2)

[Verse 1]
I was born to mourn
I guess that's why I live the life of misery
Forever through eternity
My momma was a junkie
I was born into this world a crack baby
My bottle was Brass Monkey
I developed a brain tumor
Now I consume a half ounce of Rose
I sniff bullets with my snub nose
I grew up on the east side, 7 mile area
I was raised like a pit bull terrier
I developed a criminal behavior
I murdered my first man and knew Jesus Christ wasn't my savior
Jehovah witness, witnessed me takin care of my business
So I shot him on my front porch
I took their bibles and burned em
I checked their pockets, turned em inside out
Dumped their bodies in the lake with the trout
It all started as a toddler, now I'm a .45 bullet swallower
And momma don't cry

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somehow it seems momma calling my name in my dreams
Crack fiends, amphetamines, what does it really mean?
Sometimes it feels like I'm fallin, am I closer to death?
Gaspin, suffocatin' for air, losin my breath
I see visions of doctors and scalpels makin incisions
From fatal collisions to suicide decisions
Nobody knows my suffering
I bring the pain from my migrane, I swallow 23 Bufferins
I was addicted to 'caine since birth
Crack baby goin crazy, so how much is my life worth?
A baby boy that bounces
36 ounces I flip, kilograms slam from the hip
It's kinda crazy how I'm livin'
But I'm mad on a murder ride nigga I'm suicide driven
I've arisen from a dead state-of-mind to find I was blind
Too late
Momma don't cry

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I could start all over I would
But I can't, if I could
Then my heart might have been good
I guess I lost all my time when I lost my mind
It makes me sad to hear momma cryin'
So many dyin'
I never stopped to think what I put you through
Much love, I thought you hated me
Momma see, I never knew
I guess I walked the wrong path
In the aftermath, many demons screamin my name
You don't know the half
I was dead a long time ago
Never resurrected, once the .45 shell connected
With my dome, I saw my misery crack a smile
So put my dead body in the pile
And wait a while before you come to the cemetery
Cuz you might see my tombstone burnin cuz it's necessary
Pine box, my body rots with the best of em
Momma I'm dead like the rest of em
Momma don't cry

[Hook]
