We got wicked ways
For your sunny days
We got murder for your birthday parties
Yeah, we see diamonds fall
Got our dicks topped off
But we still can't wait to be dead bodies

Knowin' my claim to fame is this game I slang
So many snakes spittin' venom, speakin' my name in vein
Through the storm and rain, shotgun thunderin' pain
Tell me, am I to blame if I blow out your brains?
On every bitch ass nigga like you cause it's bitch ass nigga like you siezin'
Give me one good reason I should not be squeezin'
I'm a real sick fella, big fella
You got a lotta lip for a nigga that ain't shit fella
Always been about my hustle, been about my money
It ain't all about rhyme and I ain't never act funny
But these bitch ass niggas in this game unreal
Quick to flip the fuckin' script for the mass appeal
But once they blood gets spilled, let's see how many feel
Who am I? The pretty boy, the city boy
That they gotta die for anotha shady record deal
The sniff a coke up off ya titty boy, the gritty boy
The never actin hostity boy
The hold it down with me boy
I seek and destroy
I get paid to employ you so I must employ
MCs enjoy my style but yet they still annoy me

La, La, La, La, La, La
La, La, La, La, La, La, La
La, La, La, La, La, La, La, Laaaa
(Come on ya'll, come on)
La, La, La, La, La, La
La, La, La, La, La, La, La

La, La, La, La, La, La, La, Laaaa
Fuck what you do, you so fake
Everything you do, everything you make
Still suicidal, how much can I take?
The world on my shoulda hold down the weight
Pressure can bust a pipe but I will not break
Forget the type of shit where you can't relate
Money hungry niggas out her will snatch ya plate
The greedy never care about if you ain't ate
Try gettin' out the game before it's too late
Or before The Wraith come and seal ya fate
Still knock knock knockin on Heaven'sGates
And you can't get in for sellin' cakes
For, for sellin' cakes
For, for sellin' cakes
Or, or sniffin' flakes
Or, or sniffin' flakes
Or, or sniffin' flakes
For, for sellin' cakes
For, for, for, for, for, for sellin' cakes

La, La, La, La, La, La
