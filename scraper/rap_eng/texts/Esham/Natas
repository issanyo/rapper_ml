Original mad mad mad mad man natas (x4)

[Mastamind]
Can't let the belly of the beast chew me up
I'd rather give ya indigestion
Do you believe in god is the question
What the hell's going on?
I smell something wrong
They wishing for death on me
Hope this wicketness don't last long
24/7 one more step away from heaven
In my journey through hell
The devil got me bailin
Fuck it, catch me if you can
Kill me like a man
If I got my finger on the trigger
Your life's in my hands
When I first came runnin' up on yo ass
What did you think I would do to you?
Boo, muthafucka
Let my voodoo run through you
If ya eyes are blind, 666 is the sign
Stupid punks can't fuck with a Mastamind

(chorus)

[T-N-T]
Police and preachers after me from state to state
Fuck the world
They find I fill it with nothing but hate
Prosecute me if they will
Jury my vision is blurry
How many died from the rhymes I've crucified?
Nigga It's alright if you die tonight
Superman don't understand I'm the kryptonite
Whether I'm dead or alive
How will I survive?
If you wanna meet god
Tell me who wanna die
Nigga don't be scared just be prepared
Once the bullets hit my dome
I'll see you there
Heaven or hell don't matter in the afterlife
Cause we all gonna die
So no need to cry

(chorus)

[Esham]
I'm comin' through
It's the crew with the voodoo
Fuck Jim Holley I don't give a fuck what you do
You punk bitch, I'mma buck, buck ya body lay
And god don't fuck around this way
I'm comin' straight from the boondocks
I'm suicidal or am I homicidal with the Glocks cocked?
I yell shells to the forehead
I scream blaz4me and now 10 suicidal dead
I recommend some psychiatric
If ya contemplating suicide
I'm down for the murder ride
I still do what I feel too
And I'm all the way real bitch
God's gonna kill you

(chorus)

"Welcome to the unpleasant world of NATAS
The Detroit based rap band who've invented their own genre... suicidalism"

"It's basically a Satan in reverse, it is Satanic
It is Satanic, I don't care how you spell it, It's Satanic"
