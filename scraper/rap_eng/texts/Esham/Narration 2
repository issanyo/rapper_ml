Bitches tryna mace me and shit
Bitch I carry mace
I'll mace you bitch
Well

Reel Life Productions, hydrolics chucks' and big bucks, dick sucks, and fucks
So deep underground with pumps and drills couldn't reach 'em for a couple of months
We let him take all the heat, it's not like he goin' to hell anyway
We just danced on a path they layed, nobody knowin' what they goin' through like no way
These rappers bit that wicked shit because Esham went too far
They just his flavor, made a lil bit safer, then run off and become stars
We live and learn in this life we live and fools learned how to bite his rhyme
Esham didn't mind, he'll get his in time, he just continued on under the sunshine baby
