[INTRO:  SAMPLES]

[HOOK]
How I need eternal rest
Help me through my mental stress (my mental stress)
(x4)

[VERSE 1]
See I've been to Hell and back
And that's a fact
I get a flashback one day I'm a snack
My mind is gone
To each his own
I wish the whole world would just leave me alone
I want to die
I do not die
I'm on the far side and it's passin' me by
I want to cry
I do not cry
I have to tell me, myself, and I
And who am I
I don't understand
Wipe that ass once the shit hits the fan
Black man, my man, man
God damn man, oh man, man
No shit, tell me something I don't know
No hope, and I can't cope
With the mental stress

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
Life ain't nothing but bullets, man
And who's that nigga with the gun in hand
(What nigga?) This nigga
(What nigga?) That nigga
(What nigga?) This nigga, finger on the trigger
(Oh no, what you going to do now boy?)
I'm fixing to go nuts like an Almond Joy
Bang my head against the wall
Three times until it bleeds
Wicket Witch of the East
The belly of the beast
See, that's just how it be
Nobody really gives a fuck about me
And you see
That I ain't got no hope
Somebody help me cope
With this mental stress

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Lock me up and throw away the key
God took my mind and said fuck me
I kick the Wicketshit until I can't no more
I black out so much I can't think no more
'Til I die, 'til I die
Wonder will I die
How you plead to homicide without an alibi
No lie, I can't wait 'til I die
Niggas still think Heaven's up in the sky
And voices in my head call my name at night
Sometimes I don't know wrong from right
Insight, Twilight Zone's my home
I put the chrome to my dome when I'm all alone
By my lonely, I'm going to join my dead homie
No hope, and I can't cope
With the mental stress

[HOOK]
