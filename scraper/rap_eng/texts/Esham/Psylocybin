(intro)
Dirt low slut tramp bitch ho motherfucking BASS

[Verse 1: Esham]
This right here will make your head ring
Right now the dead are dancing
Whats that on your forehead? Infrared beam
I stay winning like Charlie Sheen
Tuck her blood in diamonds and let em' know you mean it
Cops ask where you learned that from, on tv's whatchu screamin
Brain fragments in the back seat, you gotta clean it
Take the strap and dump it in the river, you ain't seen it
Cops come around, dont tell them shit
This a real made man, Mafia hit
Chopping up her body put it in the meat grinder
I bet the detectives'll never find her
Facebook, stay off of that, block calls dont answer that
I'll let you know where to drop the ransom at
Triple black, Cadillac, pull around to the back. Slow
(and by the way, suck my motherfucking BASS)

[Hook: Esham]
Uzis weigh a ton and rude boys always blow they guns (3x)
Rude boys always blow they guns, guns, guns, guns guns

[Verse 2: Esham]
Went inside the victor beam like police by the border
Chilling by the pool like a crocodile by water
I was on a speed boat, she was on the ski slope
Ice berg, avalanche straight overdose
Hooked on. cooked on, broken stove pilot out
In my mind Im messing up, so I try to white it out
Entering the void, got me paranoid
Camera phones and androids taking polaroids
Picture snappin, Wire tappin
Somebody working with the captain
Once I find out who the rat is
Im burying the bastard
Picture Snappin, Wire tappin
Somebody working with the captain
Once I find out who the rat is
Im burying the bastard
