[Verse 1]
I'd rather be dead than living in a world like this
With nothing to eat, no shoes on my feet
Can't get a job cause my skin color
Can't get a cab cause I'm a brother
My back's against the wall in fear I might fall
My last words when I die'll be "Fuck y'all hoes"
Nobody knows me, nobody owes me shit, so suck my dick
I'd rather be dead cause I'm sick
Of all this racism, KKK shit
All brothers ain't bad
But see you treat us like animals, so we tend to get mad
This is for the suicidalists
I'd rather be dead, grab the 9 and I might just
Cross my heart and hope to die
Pull the trigger and kiss the whole world goodbye
This is for my dead homies
Dead bodies found laying in my pocket but you don't know me
You still tripping off my old shit
But I ain't said nothing new, it's just that you don't know shit
I'm still knocking 'em out and knocking 'em dead
Dig what I said, cause I'd rather be dead

[Hook]
I'd rather be dead

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be dead, no joking
No use praying with the preacher for money, it ain't working
No use getting me a 9-to-5
Cause either way you look at it, I'm breaking my back to be alive
It goes something like that, then something like this
Next thing you know, I get pissed
My life is up and down, how you think that sound
I'd rather be dead, I can't fuck around
Time is wasting, lost the rat race and
I just found out my dad's free-basing
Problems fall on my head like a ton of bricks
And all I want to do is get my gun quick
Bad news, bad signs
And every time I want to talk, somebody tells me it's the wrong time
Another victim of circumstance
Misled, that's why I'd rather be dead

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'd rather be dead cause I'm pissed off
And I'm mad at the world, I ain't got no girl
Or no money, everything's sad but funny
Everybody seems to think I'm a dummy
But I'm going to show them all, I won't miss none of y'all
Try to figure out why I did it, you think you know it all
I'm going to hold my breath and wish for death
And when I open my eyes, I wish there's just no more life left
In my body, so I can party with the devil because I'm going to hell
Might as well
Soul and body embedded in a wooden box
When the put me in the ground, people just couldn't stop crying
Cause they knew my soul was dying
I'm going to hell, so you can stop trying to pray for me
You should have talked to me
Now I'm going to haunt your ass every night in your sleep
You better heed the word that a dead man said
Cause one day, you'll rather be dead

[Hook]
