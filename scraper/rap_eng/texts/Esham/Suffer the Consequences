Nineteen ninety nigga sick, FBI all on my dick
Life or death, if I had to pick
Rather be safe and sound like DJ Quik
You might see me smashin ghost, 8-5-0

Reach back like a pimp, slap the ho

I'mma make my pitbulls eat bloody in meat
Police wanna see a nigga face defeat
Watch the shit get bloody, next time we meet, nigga

Heard nigga don't move and shotguns clickin
Hundred g's in my safe but I came up short
They only said I only had ten when I went to court
Plus I got two warrants of child support
Ever seen a baller fall, nigga ain't no joke
They say they got a witness, who a testify
On conspiracy, and murder wit no alibi
I'm thinkin to myself, damn, I wish they all day
25, wit an ill nigga, bound to cry, so I
