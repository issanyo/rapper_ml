Word after word after word
Word after word after word

[VERSE 1]
I'm not an atheist
But what has God done for me
Oh, he let me grow up in the motherfucking ghetto
Thanks for nothing motherfucker, that's for real
One of the Ten Commandments is "Thou Shalt Not Kill"
Tell that motherfucker with a gun in my face
Or should I run from this place
And get shot in the back
That's an act of insanity
"Please, no profanity" says the radio
But fuck you, I'm gonna do what I want to do
I'm just telling facts
Cause blacks are killing blacks
Nigga stepped on my shoe and I shot him in the back
Ain't no thing, got a gang
You'll all get shot too
Once I squeeze the trigger your crew is through
Think I'm bluffing then try me
Today you'll all die, see
I got a bullet for you and your posse
I don't bullshit
No need to talk shit
The fuse is in your asshole and you just lit it
To live is evil
Evil's to live you learn that
Put it in your Holy Bible and burn that

[HOOK]
Word after word after word
Word after word after word

[VERSE 2]
Words that you're hearing
Niggas are fearing
Appearance so gruesome
Niggas are disappearing
Put up your fists, what is this
I got a Mac-11
Once I squeeze the trigger you're in Hell or Heaven
I ain't waiting around for no bodies to be found
Bullet to the head, leave another nigga dead
You got to be suicidal to fuck with a homicidal brother
Suffocated under a pillow intended to smother
Hell days, death nights
Midnight's the witches hour
Damien's your maker and he loves a blood shower
It's time to die
So bye bye you better cry, nah
You better run or something cause it's do or die
If you need an ass kicking, kicking in your rib cage
You was a good one, it read on your obituary page
Call me a ho, them's fighting words
As I'm reciting words, suckers are re-writing my words
It's simple and plain to see
Plain and simple to see
That I'm Esham and I'm great
You's a sucker but wait
This is just a style that I'm using, confusing the suckers
Cause they're stupid motherfuckers

[HOOK]
Word after word after word
Word after word after word

[VERSE 3]
Words from the lyrical
To save me's a miracle
If anything I never thought I'd turn into a criminal
So here I go once again
When I rhyme I sin
Niggas commit suicide as soon as I begin
Misled, another nigga dead
See I love the sight of blood cause my favorite color's red
I'm smashing suckers, crashing suckers dreams
And when you see Esham you start to scream
I'm hard like concrete
Funky like pig feet
Nigga get crazy and you'll be under six feet
Verse after verse it just get worse
Another sucker rehearsed, but first

[HOOK]
