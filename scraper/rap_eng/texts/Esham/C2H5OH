[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over again

[Verse 1]

I wake up
Go to sleep back out on the streets
I live in my car I can’t go far
You thinking I’m a star
Homeless phoneless a dog out here boneless
Foreclosed on my home man I thought I owned this
Reality is I’m just a slave lock me up if I misbahave
Want financial freedom
Niggas look at us like we dumb
I lost my job I lost my kids I lost my wife and the crib
Everybody wondering what we did
But I ain’t do dick this life’s just a bitch
The world just a toilet and it’s full of shit
Going round and round
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground
Bang was the gat sound
You need to slow down

[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over again

[Verse 2]

I dream about my house on the beach instead I’m living on the streets
I sure is hungry my stomach growling I need something to eat
I need something to eat, I’m hungry
I’m skinny and bony, I’m lonely
I wish somebody would just give me a coney
No mustard and onions
Can I get some extra cheese please?
Can I get some extra cheese?
Can I get some extra cheese please?
Chilli cheese on chlli cheese and a large chilli fry to go

[Hook]

I only see you in my dreams then I get this feeling again
And every time I close my eyes it starts all over again
