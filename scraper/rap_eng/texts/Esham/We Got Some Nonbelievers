Look up in the sky
It's a crow!
It's a bat!
No, it's super nigga!
Confused, some say I can't lose
All a brotha ever hear is bad point of views
Try to hold me back jack, breaking the chain of pain
Cuz the rhythm be bumpin' like a migraine
Never knew I really had a clue about fiction or fact
But I got it like that
From dawn till dusk, you might see me bust
A brain or two, I make it entertainin' you
Commercial, universal, don't matter
Every one dies when my shotgun scatters
When my heavy metal boot drops, the floor shakes
I'm comin' through like an earthquake
You can't take or make or break me
Can't shake me, don't try to fake me
Many don't believe, I will achieve
Like Ali Baba and the forty thieves
I'ma get mine, you must be out ya mind
Cuz in the ninties, acid rap is about time
We got some nonbelievers out there(2x)
Buck wild, and out on my island
In your Alpine, I'm free stlyin'
But I'm wicket, I'm wicket, I'm wicket so why don't you kick it?
To feel the force of a new breed, you might bleed
Knockin' niggas out like forty thieves
Forty thieves in the temple, I go loco
Nine millimeter point blank or a solo
Devilish, but still hell of this
Make you wanna not want to go the week you go home
I'm mystified, I won't lie
Some can't handle it so they die
Boils and bubbles of trouble brewin' what you doing?
Microphone massacre, MC's screwin' around
I don't waste time, for all the suckas
I'll see you at the finish line
Kick that shit!
From Lucifer, I give juice to ya
Been rockin' all my life so I'm used to ya
I got wanna be carbon copies that bite
Of pop rock suckas who dog the lime light
But now you've been a witness
The unholy strictly business
For all the fools who test me, don't stress me
Or the cops will have to come and arrest me
For murder one, but I've just begun
Wrap a mic cord 'round your neck and scream Red Rum
You'll be headless like Max Headroom
And I'm here to cause a little bedlam
Magical, still tragical
It all started out about a year ago
Many try to stop me, and drop me
Now they all wanna jock me
The radios won't play me
It don't faze me
I'm no sell out baby!
And we still got some nonbelievers
