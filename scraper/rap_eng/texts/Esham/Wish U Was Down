[VERSE 1]
One time, I'm fixing to blow you mind
I'm fixing to flow
I'm the Unholy
A.K.A. Esham if you don't know
Like to rub-a-dub
When I'm at the club
Let your girlie do me while I'm maxing in the tub
Suckers try to diss
They can't flow like this
Wishing they were down with Reel Life Products
But they wish
I get ill
I might kill
Another sucker MC just for a thrill
My name is Esham I got nothing to prove
Pay attention my intention is to bust a move
I might smoke a little cheeba
But some call it reefer
Give me R-E-S-P-E-C-T but my name ain't Aretha
I like to get loose
I'm the MC with the True
I came to give the party that extra boost
Party people in the place
Listen to my bass
Like my man Flavor Flav said, "It's the bass for your face!"
The real, not phony
I love the tenderoni
But just because I mack I have to be a macaroni
Yes, yes y'all, and you don't quit
Esham rocks the house with the funky shit
It goes...

[HOOK]
Wish you was down with Reel Life Products
Ain't that right brother
(x8)

[VERSE 2]
Suckers getting jealous
J-E-A-L-O-U-S
But I'll knock your ass out like my man Joe Louis
I'm never faking
Titles I'm taking
Money I'm making
And hearts I'm breaking
The U-N-H-O-L-Y's here to rock your bell
And if you disagree
Then you can go to Hell
I'm almost through
So I'm going to blaze my True
But damn I got to stop to check my mic 1, 2
I'm cool like the snow and I'm good to go
It's your man Esham on the radio show
With another funky fresh Reel Life sound
All the niggas that be talking that shit
Just wish they was down

[HOOK]
