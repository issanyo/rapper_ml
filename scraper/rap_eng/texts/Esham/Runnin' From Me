[Intro Dialogue]
[Okay, hold it down, do it again...
Like you or I would believe in God
They believe in that thing, Satan
And some officers don't believe it
It's just ghost stories to them
I, myself, have personally seen cases
It's not only a local problem, for a small department, such as mine
It's a national problem]

[Verse 1: Esham]
Come and deal with the real, the devil packs steel like this
Plus, I'm a suicidalist
God bless the child who gets Buckwild
With the wicket style, terror in the aisles
Livin' kinda foul, actin' kinda foul
Yeah, I'm kinda foul y'all, foul ball
Run from the gun, if I do ya then you're done
If it didn't do ya done, sawed off shotgun
Radio fuck 'em, cause I said fuck 'em
If I see the DJ, buck, buck, buck 'em
Unholy, unholy, unholy brudda
When I nut up, nigga shut up
Funky's gettin' cut up, into little chunks
Put ya dead body in the trunk with the pumps
Sister Mary, Sister Mary, why your pussy so hairy?
Gimme that hot Bloody Mary
Esham black devil with a gun
Run nigga run, run nigga run
I'll choke ya, provoke ya, my brother
Suffocated under a pillow intended to smother
The son of Satan's just waitin' to done in
But I got ya all runnin'!

[Outro Dialogue]
[Runnin' from the devil
They're not all liars, they're all not making it up
They're not all crazy, they're not all psychotic
Something's going on here]
(Dialing) Hello, suicide hot line
I just cut up my wife and my kids
I need to talk to somebody
Hold please
What's going..hey
If you would like to make a call, please hang up and try again
If you need help, hang up and then dial your operator
Oh, I'ma kill myself
