(Esham Talking)
Got my boys back up in here
We had to time warp back in time

(Chourus)
Whoa,Whoa,Whoa,Whooooa, (x2) (In the 50's)

Verse One:
Know, I lay me down to sleep
I pray to the lord that my bird won't creep
And if she do, Before I wake
Please let her have more bread to break
Like a house on a lake
For goodness sake
Her name is Little Debbie, and I love her cake
Make's no diffrence to me
A key to a "G", still adding up money
Lovely, keep ya water on bubbly
What would you do If you was me
Probally, G of or key-off
And sniff it all up
Until you blow your fucking head off

(Chrous)
Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, Dream, Baby (x4)

Verse Two:
I thought I saw a pussy-cat
I didn't, It was a dirty rat
In fact, it was a snake, bitch kiss it
Spitting venom, always dissing, missing
The whole point of whatimsayin'
Because your bling
Dream, Dream, Dream
When I rode by on bleem
You see me clean
Looking at me like a fiend
It was obseen
With a beauty of the week out of JET magazine

(Chrous) fade away!!!!!
