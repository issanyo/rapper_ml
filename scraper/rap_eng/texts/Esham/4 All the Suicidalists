[VERSE 1]
Listen cause this is the sound of a crucifix
The U-N-H-O-L-Y is now in the looser mix
Unholy is inside of me so I get homicitis
The unholy poetry is for all the Suicidalists
I'm just another brother from D-E-T-R-O-I-T
I pack a Smith & Wesson cause I don't know Karate
I ain't no punk nigga, pulling triggers is my thing though
Give myself an afro, never sported a Kangol
Niggas I strangle, they don't wanna tangle
Fuck a priest cause I mash and mangle
I'm taking it to the top, I'm making 'em drop
They thinking I'm not
I'm shaking 'em, baking 'em, kicking 'em, sticking 'em
And always keep hitting 'em
Until I get rid of them, I'm picking up the microphone
To kick the funky D-O-P-E, E is on the microphone
I had to make it funky once again for my opponent
I left the stage full of blood stains cause I was on it
The U-N-H-O-L-Y: Esham, you never knew I
Could kick it so wicked, inflict pain, do I?
Of the U-N-H-O-L-Y, hell I kick a lot of titles
But this is for all the Suicidalists

"My father was a priest, cold blooded, he's dead"
"Then heard the demon screamin' as his body bled"
"My father was a priest, cold blooded, he's dead"
"Poured on the holy water, 'bless the dead' is what I said"

[VERSE 2]
Some say I'm the son of Satan, but they're relatin'
Bodily harm, some waitin' for the storm
That I bring when I sing, it's a gathering of people
The U-N-H-O-L-Y so check out the evil
Knievel, not his [???] that the wicked poetry funk
Esham's the soul that I'm projecting huh?
I'm like a deadly disease, three hundred and sixty degrees
Of the U-N-H-O-L-Y so fall to your knees
Death is all around, the sounds'll pound down
And drive you insane, until it busts your brain
I'm a head banger, a Acid Rap singer
Coming on stage putting up my middle finger
Saying "fuck it" and grabbing my balls
All the MC's in the house got shit in their drawers
Cause I'm the scarer, a one man terror
So never compare a sucker with me cause I run 'em like mascara
So no need, to tell you my title cause you know what my title is
This is for all the Suicidalists

"I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell"
"A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies"
"Dreaming of the people I dismantle"
"To stop her nerves from jumping I just cut her to bits"

[VERSE 3]
Death is the penalty if you're ever caught biting me
Some say I'm insane but it's my split personality
The groove is just wicked, it's wicked so it makes me shake
I thought this time I'd make a rhyme and do what it takes
To suckers trying to copycat I'll have to get my gat
And bust you in the head for trying to steal my Acid Rap
Esham's here just for this verse
The U-N-H-O-L-Y rocks it much worse
Rock and roll, heavy metal hip hopster
Word After Word 'til the break of dawn, brother
Fucking A, as I play
To the rhythm that I just kicked today, I'm going to sway
And keep on kicking it for the ones who buy this
The needle's on the wax for all the Suicidalists

"I'm a ho so I do it like a G.O."
"I just educate minds to reality"
"Oh shit damn that's a no-no"
"So you weak ass hoes keep dreaming"
