"Brand new Esham from the Eastside of the galaxy"

(Esham)
I met this little girlie
Her pussy hairs was curly
The way that bitch sucked off my dick
I busted my nut early
She asked me for some mo' dick
And started sucking mo' dick
I said relax you freaky bitch and sit yo' ass up on it
Her momma's in the kitchen
Her daddy's watching the game
I got this bitch all knocking shit off of the shelves And screaming my name
Bitch you take this dick up
And pay me for that weed
You can't just smoke my shit up, get some dick, and tell me to leave
Your little sister's watching
I think that bitch is hot
I know she just a youngin' but I'm good for what she got
She peeping through the keyhole
I think she wants some peehole
I f**ked that bitch in the butt, in the backseat of yo' daddy's Geo
I stole yo momma's vicodin
She just had surgery
But, I was so quick in and out of that purse
That bitch never heard of me
I would try f**king yo momma
But that bitch just so fat
I seen that bitch step on a one dollar bill and leave four quarters flat
WHAT!

(Chorus - RudeBoy)
How many bitches need to know this name? (Boogieman)
Check yo ouija board, this ain't no game (Esham)
Eastside hoes and money all night (Boogieman)
With this boogieman you'll be alright

(Esham)
Bitch I want a piece of that cookie
And bitch I want it for free
Popular bitches get they little pussies popped
Like Brent Bocker f**king with me
I smack your silly ass up
You don't roll that f**king grass up
And after I'm done, I want the panties gone
Cause bitch I'm tearing that ass up
I'm mashing down Gratiot, gay bashing
Necks I'm slashing
Haul assing
Heads I'm smashing and crashing
Cause deaths my passion
Til I'm ashing
Wicked shit never gets spun
That's why we get clever, get guns
I pull a DJ out of his pj's
It was E & J with the Soopa Villains
And bitch wake me up with brains
And maybe I'll loosen your chains
Cause bitch you know you will never change
You seen more dick than Hanes

(Violent J)
*Break* (x2)
What are we gonna do with these hoes
Smack me a bitch up I suppose
Hurry up bitch, and jump out ya clothes
You about to have dick coming out ya nose

(Esham)
I met this girl named J-Lo
Jimmy-hat on my dick like a sombrero
When I rawed her, she said "Te Quiero!"
Then I was out like human tornado
You might see me in the streets of the Motown
Pushing crack to my hoes like Bobby Brown
Oprah please come and slob me down
I'll be like Steadman(?), how you like me now?
I got big dick for you hoes to lick
I don't trick bitch but take ya bank and split
Beyonc√®, that's why I'm f**king Kelly
In the backseat of a Chevy, after Nelly
Michelle pussy just too smelly
So we threw her outta the telly
Oh really?
Don't be acting silly
Hoes buttnaked, ya'll know the drilly

(Chorus - RudeBoy)
How many bitches need to know this name? (Boogieman)
Check yo ouija board, this ain't no game (Esham)
Eastside hoes and money all night (Boogieman)
With this boogieman you'll be alright
