Ugly is the new pretty

[HOOK]
When the sun goes down
And the darkness comes
Trust no one, trust no one
When you bleeding in the water
That's when the sharks come
Trust no one, trust no one

[VERSE 1]
I don't trust my own mama
As far as I can throw her
I don't trust my baby mama
All the money I owe her
I don't trust the Government
So I'm not a voter
I don't trust you so I tote a forty-four-a
I don't trust none of the things that you say you done
Wait, you ugly
You your mama's son
I don't trust that
I don't trust this
