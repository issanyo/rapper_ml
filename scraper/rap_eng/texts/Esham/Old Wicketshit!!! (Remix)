[HOOK]
Some old Wicketshit (x4)

[VERSE 1]
Midnight's the Witches Hour
And you're outside
Somebody played a Reel Life Product tape
And committed suicide
Tryed to save your soul, it can't be done
Unholy to the son of Satan, I ain't the one
Congratulations brothers and sisters who prayed for me
Some slayed for me and still pray for me
They say my rhyme is Satanic, it'll make you vomit
And I think I'm the shit
When it comes down to it
You knew it and know it
Unholy poet, your mind I'll blow it
If you ever heard me rhyme for the first time
Hear, it's like a hurricane, stunning like Novocain
Simple and plain, Reel Life Products is insane
Your're fucking with the wrong one
Listen 'til the song's done
Fuck around and be on the wrong end of a gun, son
You're listening to insanity
But that's just the man in me
I said I'm Esham and you said, "How can it be?"
I'm a psychopathic, automatic
Reel Life Product, pro-static
Fuck it

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
I'm the U-N-H-O-L-Y better known as Esham
Champ's a chump, step up and get some punk
Playing around with me is like playing with a rattlesnake
I shake, and bake, and break the fake
E-S-H-A-M
I'm him, not one of them
Reel Life Product's grim
A schizophrenic motherfucker future's looking dim
A R-E-A-L
A L-I-F-E
A P-R-O-D to the U-C-T
Reel Life Product's what I spelled out, very seldom yell
The record selling suckers, dope we sell
I have the mind of the Devil
The body of Lucifer
Give me a mic and watch me get loose for you
Convince a motherfucker that suicide's the way
Another homicide, I'll live another day, I lied
I said I was the Unholy, cause the preacher told me
The U-N-H-O-L-Y is a brother with soul, see
It's written down in the Goddamn Scriptures
I'm not Satanic so fuck ya'll bitches
Fuck it

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Holy God, fuck the joys
Here comes Reel Life Products and the Devil's Groove
You can't move
You might as well tape it
And listen, and listen until it's your favorite
The speakers are smoking
Niggas choking
I'm provoking
No joking
Motherfuckers hoping
That I get off the mic and shut up forever
But that's a dream that'll never come true, never
I'm insane, it's hard to maintain my mentality
If you keep listening you'll have a Wicket personality
Fuck it

[HOOK]

[OUTRO]
This is my song
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, I kick the Wicketshit
This is my song
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, I kick the Wicketshit
This is my song
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, I kick the Wicketshit because I don't give a fuck
This is my song
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, this is my song for you I kick the Wicketshit
This is my song
Kick the Wicketshit, some old, some old Wicketshit
This is my song
I kick the Wicketshit, some old, some old Wicketshit
