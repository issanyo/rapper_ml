I know that I'm crazy
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know that I'm lazy
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know you don't love me
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know that you hate me
(It's nobody's fault but mine)

Once again, it's on, 3-5-7 chrome
Damn what's goin' on in my maggot dome
A pill poppin', hip hoppin' nigga with a death wish
Suicidalist but I'm still so selfish
Used to have this hoe, that anotha while ago
But the bitch played out like disco, cisco
Drinkin' dead bodies, stinkin' nervous twitch
Eye blink
I stabbed her 26 times with my dagger Jiggy Skwagger style
I gave a smile
Rigor mortis body froze
Them slit her throat then watch her shake till her eyes close
A bloody body on my bathroom flo'
When the cops came to get me I said so, hey yo



I know that I'm crazy
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know that I'm lazy
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know you don't love me
(It's nobody's fault but mine)
I know that you hate me
(It's nobody's fault but mine)

1, 2, 3 pigs knockin' at my do'
Tryna catch the big bad wolf, I blew they house down, BOOM
Bacon all over the room
Say hello to my little friend
I bust a shot again
3 cops dead, now I'm called the cop killa
Illa cap peela
Bullet body full of bloody naps
Bust caps in Superman kneecaps
I can't believe she didn't love me so she didn't breath
I took her to the place where the sun don't shine
Without you, there's no me, so I'm goin' out my fuckin' mind
Runnin' blind with the bloody steel piece
I didn't know I was surrounded by police
And all I said was

I know that I'm crazy
