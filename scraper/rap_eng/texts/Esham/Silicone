You wanna be dead nigga?
Yeah you, you wanna be dead?
Now how you lie, cause I'll kill you
Yeah I'll kill ya

Lord forbid, I do a bid
I never bid on a sucka's life
And if I did, it'd be a jackknife
I'm out to kill a clone
Niggas be actin' silicone, for tha real it's on, still it's on
In my darkest hour, I clock the Glock
Death is certain, life is not
I got 13 ways, less than 7 days
To change my wicked ways before I'm off to an early grave
One more is drug related, another body murdered premeditated
Fallen victim to what I stated
You don't understand me cause I'm dyslexic
My styles come sick as anorexic
I don't sing church songs but bust shot guns
At ministers cause I can't trust none
Break out the skull and bones
Here comes the ill ass nigga with the 3 5 7 chrome
And it goes on in my maggot brain
I remain insane to bring the pain with the migraine
Niggas with breasts I'll snatch yo' heart out yo chest
And stand like Kano possessed as I finish him
Your silicone leaks, nigga

Nigga, nigga, silicone, nigga

All I hear is your screams
Somebody's screamin' out my name
I weigh my uzi on a triple beam
Unload my magazine niggas can't read me
Redrum's all I hear so you wanna bleed me
I pop niggas like corns, stickin' niggas like thorns
And I yawns at your funeral while your family mourns
I'm not inclined to sympathize in my mind
I'll be glad when you in a body bag for bed time
You can't afford this, all aboard this night train
Come and ride the midnight maggot brain
I need some therapy I shot my therapist
See, I be pissed, cause I'm nothin' but a straight suicidalist
Idiotic, my voodoo's symbotic to a mad man
I'm down to put a slug in an Aryan
And I'm down for whatever, whenever, however
Is clever whether forever or for never
So don't test one mad motherfucker
If you do, dick sucker, I'mma pop yo silicone

Nigga, silicone
Nigga

My wicked shit is wicked, niggas bite it when I kick it
But I'm sick with this, it's so ridiculous
I don't believe in God, so it's odd
'Cause every time I bust ill shit, niggas screamin' "oh my God!"
I got the G-Lo, I got the G-Lo
And it's cocked to pop, pop, pop piggity pop pop
And it don't stop it never did
The wicked shit'll never die, I have no alibi for murder, shit
I'm contemplatin' suicide 24-7
And like I told your ass before it ain't no fuckin' heaven
I'm manic depressed, I'm panicked to never confess
I'm the one that put them slugs in my momma chest
Premeditated, murder's always on my fuckin' mind
Body outlined chalk to walk the flatlines
You wanna know what goes on in my maggot brain
It won't stop until the whole world feels my pain
Chemical dependencies, suicidal tendency
Mental stress got me beggin' for eternal rest
I must confess to the real, I'm out to kill a clone
I pop titty niggas that's silicone

Nigga, silicone
Nigga, nigga, silicone
