[VERSE 1]
Once again I've come to get 'cha
Hit 'cha with the razor, slit 'cha
Unholy, niggas need to stay up off my dick though
Sick though, when I hit 'cha with the wicked rhyme
Stickin' it in your mind, rewind the flatline
Unload, explode
Here's the new episode
Paranoia, can't do nothin' for ya
Helterskkkelter, mind-melter, if I felt 'cha
If I die I'm goin' to Hell, who do you tell
Run from the Devil, got a shovel gravedigger
How you gonna kill a dead nigga if you figure I'm dead
Here's the oops upside your head
Here's a hot piece a lead
And it said I walk the flatline

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
If I'm on the flatlines it means I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Death is the seventh sign
And I'm runnin' out of time
So check this, I'm a Suicidalist
That means I ain't afraid to die
If I play the Game of Death
That means I play the game to die
Russian Roulette
Get my toolie and act a foolie
Unruly, you'll see me lose my cool, G
Click, click, click, click, clickity, click, click
Cock the hammer
And when it slams, Goddamn, bam

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Well I walk the flatlines and I'm 'bout to lose my grip
Got a gun in my hand wrapped around my finger tips
If I slip then I might catch a hole in my head
Screamin' out bloody redrum
For something I said, um
My minds goin' bedlam
Flashbacks of Rambo
So much pressure
I grab my ammo off the dresser
I'm shakin', I start to tremble
But Jack be nimble
My mind starts crashin' like a cymbal
And I'm in limbo
To calm me down I think I better count to ten
But I only made it to nine
I did a flatline
