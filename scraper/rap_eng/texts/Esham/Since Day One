[Esham talking]
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the streets...

[Chorus]
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

[Esham]
Time to cook up, got the California hook-up
My paper's stacked like skyscrapers, gotta look up
24 parlay, tryin'a do a show a day
Move a-half-a brick of Yay, get the fuck up out my way
OH NO, I don't give a fuck again
Cock my UZI you might catch a buck, my friend
Guns and grams, you know that's what we on
Servin' Zips in zones, that's what we on
Movin' bricks and O's, that's what we on
Pounds of Kush to grow, that's what we on, Yo
Summertime snow, that's what we on
Countin' cash all night, 'til the early mizzorn

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

[Esham]
A-1 Yola, Caine and baking soda
Takin' your orders, I'm the bolder promoter
Went from rocks to 8 balls, half Oz's
Full Onions to QP's, a afee to a half a B
Now I'm in the streets of the D
And if you wanna get money, then you're fuckin' with me
But if you're broke and can't cope, write a suicide note
Cuz if you come short with my money, then your ass'll get smoked
I ain't no joke, don't provoke the pistol smoke
Takin' penitentiary chances, livin' life with dope, bitch!

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

[Esham]
Sitting down in a weight house, countin' the bricks
Duncan-Hines, Betty Crocker, all in the mix
Sara Lee, bake me a C-A-K-E
Rollin' through your hood with my shit off safety
Boomin' narcotics, Reel Life Product
Through Hell I ball, in gasoline draws, yall
Read fed magazine with teflon bullets
Schizophrenic, Manic depressed, when I pull it
Rubber band rapper, all my knots, sittin' in spots
Duckin' from cops, still servin' when the block is hot
POP POP goes the weasel, I'm diesel
Stuntin' on these hoes, like I'm Evel Knievel

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

This is dedicated to the niggas who been down since day one...
A-1...
Day one...
A-1...

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?

Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on the street, what'you say son?
Since day one, I been pushin' A1
Movin' Yola on these streets, what'you say son?
