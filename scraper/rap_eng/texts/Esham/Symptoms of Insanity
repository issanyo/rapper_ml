[Verse 1: Esham]
I'm coming back again and I'd rather be dead
I'm out my mind so much I need a brand new head
The Symptoms of Insanity's got me intertwined
Voices in my head playing tricks on my mind
I got to get my head together, cause it's falling to pieces
My mind has a migraine so I'm calling Jesus
13 ways to commit suicide, I'll do it
Razor to my wrist, someone ask me what I'm doing
I want to just die, I want to just die
So please cut up my blood veins
Some may imply I'm insane
On my shirt are blood stains
The room is spinning and I'm grinning, thinking evil thoughts
Nine Dead Bodies and I never got caught
A schizophrenic, so many panic is it just the man in me
Don't understand it, G, I got the symptoms of insanity

[Hook: Sample]
"Do not attempt to think or depression may occur"

[Verse 2: Esham]
The symptoms of insanity, I tried to get to some therapy
Went on the nut cause nobody cares for me
Shoot them all up, shoot them all up, bang, bang, buck, buck
If I catch a slug in the head, I'm dead, I don't give a fuck
Who want to know, who want to know, where the bad guys go
9-mil, aim to kill, right between the eyes, bro
Kill the Fetus, kill the mama, kill the daddy and the dog
Shoot them all up, shoot them all up, shoot them all up dead, y'all
Boy, I'll kill you bumbaclot, wicket and I'm deadly
So many times, I rock my rhymes and motherfuckers scared of me
Esham the Black Devil, Unholy niggaro
Symptoms of insanity, I'm quick to pull the trigger, ho
A schizophrenic, so many panic say it's just the man in me
Don't understand it, G, I got the symptoms of insanity

[Verse 3: Esham]
I'm coming back with the wicked shit, but now I got to fuck it
I cut my dog's head off and threw it in a bucket
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, cross my heart and hope to die
Flowing like this is slitting my wrists, I see the terror in ya eye
Back them all up, then buck them all down, let them all know I'm not fucking around
Standing my ground and holding a frown, holding my dick and holding it down
Walking the trail, bloody as well, dead skin under my fingernail
Crucifix, triple six, Esham's back the funky mix
Live after life, Life After Death, tell what's left as I'm holding my breath
Insanity symptom, symptom insanity, lost my brain and humanity
Give your life, appetite, setting a fire on Devil's Night
Take me alive, bury me dead, voices are screaming inside of my head
Losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, I got the symptoms of insanity
