[INTRO]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

[VERSE 1]
Crazy convict, don't take no shit
Since age 13 I was ill-legit
I had a problem with homicide
Crazy ass suicide
Suck a motherfucking pussy's dreams and I died
Black from the Hell raised
Don't want your dead days
No one listens to what the Devil says
But I'm smooth like Satan
And I was waitin' for another death
So breathe your last breath
I'm a psychopath, crazy motherfucker laugh
At a funeral, tell me do you know
Any other brother, any other that can get some
Say his name and there'll be another victim
See, words can't describe the pain you'll feel
You can't imagine it... cause death's real
A homicidal vital, recital is my title
Got a serious psychological problem
Death's my idol
Crucifix and tricks, to black magic
A brother named Esham, treach and tragic
The Devil's my boy and Satan's my son
The gun
Loaded up and ready so that you don't want none
Shoot you in the back like Billy the Kid
Talking about taking me out... shit
Better put your dukes up before you get fucked up
Crucified your mama
So what, so what
So what you going to do
Take revenge like a brother, man
And get fucked up
Like your mother, man
Bad ass brother with the mind of the Devil
Maximum overdrive, trying to stay alive
I sold the Devil my soul for gold
The story is told
I'm the Exorcist
Yo
Brothers and brothers have died
Committed suicide
Reel Life killed a motherfucker, so another homicide
Demon's my trademark
Rhymes be to play marks
Reel Life Product was down from the start
Sacrifice your life tonight with a knife
Pray to Hell and give the Devil your life
See many of you motherfuckers don't understand it, see
How long can you listen to one man's insanity?
Prophecy: the dead has arose and
The Devil is dead and one man is chosen
To be the dead, to kill
Bloodshed
So much bloodshed it painted the town red
My mind is evil
Evil's inside my mind
The Devil's gonna get you
Just a matter of time
Go to sleep and never wake up
Your dream's a nightmare
The witch was riding your back, I was there
Medusa turned you to stone
You're stuck in eternal place
Imprisoned in a shell with a dead man's face
666, crucifix, Hell's the fire on the candlesticks
This is The Devil's Groove
The dance floor's bloody
Release your sins up, up in the slutty
Go commit suicide
Another homicide
Stupid
