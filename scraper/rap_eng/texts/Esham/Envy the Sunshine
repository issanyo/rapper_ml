[Esham's Daughter Talking]
I really envy the sunshine, baby
I really envy the sunshine, baby
Da-da, sing that song

I would like to always light your world
If you promise to be forever my baby girl
And I'll take you flyin' high with me
Or we can just sit like birds on a branch in a tree
And be free
We fly so high in the clouds
Nobody else is allowed
Up, up, and away we go now
Tell me if I should slow down
Slow down, slow down, slow down
So you can smell the roses
I think I smell the roses
But then again, it could be heavenly blues
Gone off the Morning Glory seeds is true
I water these seeds for you
From the sea shores on earth to the moon
With sunlight they blossom and bloom
With sunlight they blossom and bloom

(Chorus)
[Brittany Hurd/Santos]
I really, really envy the sunshine, baby
I really, really envy the sunshine[2x]

I would like to brighten up your day
If you promise to be forever my lady
And I'll take you ridin' up the block wit' me
Keep everything you need inside ya, neena
When we ridin' everything seems so sweet
I hold you close when it's time
Your favorite shape is a .9
My girl is one of a kind
She could be blowin' my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind
I gave up Guns and Roses
I take a picture when she poses
But then again she could be murderin' you
Redrum, redrum, wanna come get somethin
You's a fool, better keep ya cool
'Cuz we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn how to peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools
Better keep ya cool
'Cuz we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn how to peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools
Better keep ya cool
'Cuz we all playin' by the street rules
In the sunlight is where we learn to how peep fools
Plus put 'em to sleep wit' tools

(Chorus)
