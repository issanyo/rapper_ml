[Hook]
Hustlin and grinding
Strugglin all my life
Search but never finding
Trying to get it right

[Verse 1: Esham]
I'm just trying to get it right
Day and night
Life, livin in frustration everyday is a fight
You gotta wake up and do something
Don't sit around
Time don't wait for no man, You got to get around
You gotta keep it movin, You can't play around
You can turn it up, but sometimes turn it down
You can keep it real, or you can be a clown
You can be lost, or you can be found
How you wanna do it?
Do it how you do it
Just do something, Just get to it
I'm just tellin ya'll cause this the game I got
Ask me where I get it, A Detroit block

[Hook]
Hustling and grinding
Struggling all my life
Search but never finding
Trying to get it right

[Verse 2]
I guess I was just lost in the madness
Caught up in a world of pain
Sittin, reminiscing, will I see my girl again?
It was all a dream until reality came
Then I watched everybody personality change
In retrospect thinkin how fast it went
TNT died in a car accident
And now I'm lost
But one day we all gotta pay that cost
See you at the crossroads dawg
Until then we creepin through the fog
It's all real life so we doin it for ya'll
As long as I'm here I'mma stand up for you tall
And never fall when my homies call

[Hook]
Hustling and grinding
Struggling all my life
Search but never finding
Trying to get it right

[Verse 3]
We can forgive but not forget
What happened to us and move ahead
Keep dwelling on it and we all'll be dead
I know it ain't all about just making bread
Suckin and fuckin like Scarface said
But who am I to talk when I'm the first to throw the Molotov to set the whole shit on fire
But if I told you I did all that shit I said in my raps I'd be a muthafuckin liar
I'm just entertaining
But ya'll it seems to be raining
Cats N mutherfuckin dogs man
Step out the rain
You know
Ya'll need to step out the rain
Cause there's too many people out there gettin wet
