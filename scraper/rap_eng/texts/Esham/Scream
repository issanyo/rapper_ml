(backround: Esham)
Somebody help me, somebody help me!

(Chorus) - (Psychopathic Screams)

(Esham)
No one hears my screams
I told you my deepest fears
But still I'm having bad dreams
It seems I'm still trapped inside a paradox
Whether you care or not
My infrared plays connect-the-dots
The evil nigga, no nigga could ever figure the style
Commense the body count and the bodies pile
A hundred miles
And me styles never get worn
The Wicket Shit'll never die
No need to mourn
And suckas stay off my dick I'm never friendly
To go to church, fuck Jesus cause it just ain't in me, in me
Lord have mercy, damn its the devil's day
Can I say, wicket niggas come out and play, and hey
I do it for the Suicidalists
And ain't no other nigga suicidal like this
So scream

(Chorus)

(Esham)
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Redrum, redrum, murder one
Nigga with the gun, action
Rude boy never hesitate to bust
And fuck any motherfucker who ain't down with us
The wicket nigga, the nigga the wicket, coming with the wicketness
And niggas still on my dick for this
A straight suicidal, homicidal brother
Never like another, take a pillow and smother your mother
Run for cover, hide for shelter
Nigga I felt'cha
And oh yeah Hellterskkkelter
Fuck the funk
I'm never down
Me and my nigs don't fuck around
I'm strictly underground
I'll take your mama, your daddy and everything you love
And tell your ass it ain't no heaven up above and just scream

(Chorus)

(Esham)
My shit's so inconspicuous
It's so ridiculous
Niggas lick my style like a dick, eh
But I'm a nut up, cut up, what up
Cut their dick off, and sew their butt up
'Cause they're some pussies
Bitch get back off my bozack
Cut it loose, my shit's triple phat like a goose and
I know you want to say the shit that make you vomit
I live more Thug Life then on 2Pac's stomach
Check the maggot brain theory
Niggas can't get near me to hear me
I'm busting off like a sawed off, shotgun
Love, I got none
Niggas better run when I cock with a hot one
I still swallow bullets, spitting them in your face
Cause I love the way gun powder tastes and I just scream

(Chorus)
