[Verse 1: Monoxide]
You wanna know what it's like to be me?
Horny all the time, addicted to nicotine
Shit, I'm a dope fiend I mean I fiend for dope shit
And that shit you spit I don't want to hit
I'm sweet, broke, and hopeless. Don't provoke this
I turn you into a snack cake and sell the
Rights to Hostess
I need money, any way I can get it
I'm finished with all these industry snakes selling me wolf tickets
I been to Def Jam, Island, and Universal
But none of em could handle somethin' so controversial
I'm not your regular white boy competitor
I gotta get the cover if it means choking out the editor
It ain't getting no better while all my days go by
I need some answers so I look to the sky
But he can't help me, even if he tried
Even if I put all of my faith in God

[Hook: Monoxide & (Esham)]
Get yo' ass up outta my way
(Out of my way, out of my way)
(All my live mother fuckers let me hear you say)
(Out of my way, out of my way)
By all means necessary to get paid
(Out of my way, out of my way)
Rather be dead than broke's what I say
(Out of my way, out of my way)

[Verse 2: Esham]
I know a lot of record execs wanna see me die
'Cause I'm C-O-D I need my M-O-N-E-Y
Don't turn this into another unsolved homicide
All I gotta hear is the word from Monoxide
Misery love company, the life insurance policy
Is that what you want from me?
Fuck the record you making 'cause most fools is fakin'
The dreams you chasing, really ain't out there
So get out of my way, or gimme my pay
Or I'ma spray, today's your last day
Piss on your deal like a urinal
Sign the Devil's contract I'll read the eulogy at your funeral
Man you don't know, me and Mono
Play your Ass like A Phono'
Die on the day your record come out for a promo
Sign another record contract like "Oh no!"

[Bridge x2: Blaze]
Everybody if you feel this, hands up
If you know what the deal is, hands up
If you do what it takes to get your grass up
Let me see you get your hands up
(Bla-Bla-Bla Blaze)


[Verse 3: Monoxide]
Remember when we used to all be broke
And no one even had the nerve to take a drag of a smoke
But now it's all different just because we all grew up
Now your money's the only way to see if you're a screw up
I do what I gotta do to get paid
Been doing it ever since the fifth grade
It's no fun when you love to smoke
But can't buy a pack of 'Ports 'cause that ass is broke
And if you can't buy smokes, then you can't buy weed
So you sit there stressin' 'bout the money you need
Watchin' my pockets bleed like a murdered emcee
Who just got shot and robbed by somebody like me
Just know me and the world got beef
Got me standin' here grittin' my teeth, I wanna eat
Don't sleep on this, 'cause you might get robbed
And I think I'm just the man for the job

[Hook x2]
