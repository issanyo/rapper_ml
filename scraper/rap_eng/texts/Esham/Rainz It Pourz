I don't want to live no more...
I don't want to live no more!

Nigga came up low key
Mothafuck a O.G
I got somthin' for you niggas in my community
Top ranked I rhyme, at banks bullets fly constantly
Walkin' through your hood with Glocks like Charles Bronson be
When it rains, it pours
I stuck up stores, pimped whores
Shot apartments on the 3rd floors
Momma knew her baby boy was raised no sucka
They knew my rucka, scurvy than a mothafucka
A nigga has no fears, drink 40s of beers with peers
Stealin' cars to steal Pioneers
Niggas lootin', my baby sister's prostitutin'
Bullets pollutin', all the funerals are drive-by shootins

When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours

Pockets got fatter, fiends were fiendin'
I'm the bad seed of semen, I had my Poppa out Mescalinin'
My area got scarier, mass hysteria
Mothafuckas was catchin' bullets like malaria
Every hour I'm sellin' kilos of powder
Nothin' but flour, that's why they shot up my Eddie Bauer
Growin' up as a kid, fuck it, I barely made it
Duckin' bullets, dodgin' cops, bein' incarcerated
Triggers I squeeze after doin' B&Es
Bullets richochet through arms, legs and arteries
Don't try to play me, hottie, I got a 17 shot shottie
And quick to but these bullets in yo' baby's body

When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours

My lifestyle's illegal jackin' niggas for Regals
And puttin slugs in niggas with the Desert Eagle
My propaganda, I sell words for slander
I bust caps and killed an innocent bystander
These are the days of our lives
Stabbin' bitches like O.J. with knives
Fuckin' up mo' niggas than St. Ides
I got the mind of a lunatic, nobody cares
I got the visions of drive-bys in wheelchairs
Crime relation, my bullets ejac like masturbation
Niggas roll deep like meditation
Fuck the fuzz, it's goin' down and when it does
It's all because that's the type of nig I was

When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
When it rains, it pours
