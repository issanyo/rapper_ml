Let me hear you say "Kid Rock's up on the stage"

[Verse]
Hey slick, check it
I'm the Rock you know, I'm 'about to smoke it up
So I can rock a few old school disco cuts
I'm the Crisco slick, drinkin' Cisco, shit
I'm the ultimate
Yes the K, to the I to the D-D-D, R-O-C-C-K all motherfucking day
Far from strong, never steer you wrong
Got the nitrous tanks and the 4 foot bong
Uh, and I ain't bullshitting
Shucking motherfuckers with the game I'm spitting
And ain't a damn thing changed
Come on y'all and tell me, whats my name?
(Kid Rock, Rock)

I'm the pork-fried pimp with the hip and hop
But on the seven seas they call me Captain Rock
I had the Gucci watch back in the day
But I pawned that shit for a rock last May
And now I'm back on track
I don't smoke the crack, don't shoot the smack
I told you all once I don't bang
But I lick more coochie than KD Lang
Uh, and you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body pop
That somebody, anybody, all you all scream
(Kid Rock, Rock)

Check it out yo
What I wanna do is break it down
And show you all a little something about where I come from
Show you some skills of how I used to rock basement parties
On the wheels of steel, back in the day in the Clem, y'all
Check it
(Kid Rock, Rock)
Turn up my table...

So what up, y'all?
It's nothing but a motherfucking party y'all
Break it down on your ass like this
It ain't no party like a Detroit party
Cause a Detroit party don't stop
It ain't no party like a Detroit party
When your in the fuckin' house with Kid Rock
