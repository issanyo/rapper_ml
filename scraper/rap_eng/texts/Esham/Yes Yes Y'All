3-1-3, D-E-T, N.Y.C
Detroit up in this motherfucker!
Esham and Kool Keith

Ass, and titties, hundreds and fiddies
Me and Kool Keith macked them hoes from L.A., to New York City
I take 'em blind crippled and crazy, ugly or pretty
I beat it up, make the pussy meow like a kitty
So slow your roll, slide upside down on the pole
Bounce that ass, bounce that ass, let your knees touch your elbows
In Detroit, Michigan cruisin spaceships of Daddyville
Just got back from Bootyville, spending big face bills
On some exotic body hottie erotic
Vision blurry from the narcotics, keep pushin CRAZY products
Parlay, parlay, twenty-fo' seven all day
Spendin like Michael Jackson the "Off the Wall" way
Make your booty clap, chickenheads flap chicken wings
Padussy juice on my diamond rings, from the fast finger-ing
And the smell's linger-ing

[Hook]
Yes yes y'all, you know we rock y'all
[E] We freak them hoes twenty-fo' seven around the clock y'all
Yes yes y'all, that booty tight y'all
[E] We drinkin and spendin money with these hoes all night y'all
Yes yes y'all, you know we rock y'all
[E] We freak them hoes twenty-fo' seven around the clock y'all
Yes yes y'all, that booty tight y'all
[E] And we come get up in some ass, tonight y'all

[Kool Keith]
Titties and booty; she got them silk thongs on
Yo my song's on, here's your T-I-P
Move in V.I.P., G-strings of energy, Esham and me
Rack up control and move when the butts stack up
Panties get touched when the butt back up
It's all RODEO, for a cup, like Romeo
Move in your area, girl what? We ain't scared of ya
Two drinks minimum - don't worry, we maximum
When assed up to the pole, now we taxin 'em
Detroit Los Angeles Miami can you handle this?
My shit gets frisked while you stare and sweat, weave twist
Go knock the drink off the table, please watch it miss
We like to watch the girls kneel down when they piss
Our style is right y'all, we rock tonight y'all

[Hook]

[E] Yeah, yo Keith
[K] Yeah

[K] What's that highway run through your house?
[E] Uhh, I-94 - Detroit baby
[K] Right, we gon' take 'em through there
