[Intro]
In all, eleven people arrested; ages 19 through 45
The conspiracy investigation encompassed 6 months
Information came through various sources
The operation involved mid- to upper-level drug dealers
And it wasn't just local
Police say the drugs were allegedly sent by UPS
Or simply by vehicle from Los Angeles into Detroit
And finally Columbus, Ohio
The powdered cocaine was to be cut into crack

[Verse 1]
In 1989 I was pushin' dimes out of crack houses
Tryin' to gets my mail on
I gots my sale on
I murdered the basehead 'cause he tried to tell on
The nigga with the 3-5-7 chrome
My mind was gone
When I did dirt, I was alone
Got on, got strong
I put my homey down, and we was down
In the summertime we made it snow all over town
200 Gs made, money still coming in
Got a connect with an ill Columbian
No matter who you trust you simply cannot win
It's always fun in the beginning but it's pain in the end
My homey got shot, murdered on 7 Mile
In broad daylight
At night I squeeze the AK tight
And fear I might be next in line
For the body chalk outline
It's going down

[Hook:  Dice] (x4)
Kill or be killed, nigga
You ain't real, nigga
Feel my steel, nigga

[Verse 2]
It seems niggas wanna test me
Police out to arrest me
'Cause the streets scream "Child molest me"
I emptied out a full clip
Now police got their hands full of bullshit
It's drug related so they hate it
I figured it was that nigga who I last sold a Parakeet
Who murdered my homey in his Cherokee
I saw that nigga at the McDonald's drive through
So I pulled up to his bumper
And unloaded my dumper
He had his bitch and his baby in the car
But I didn't give a fuck
Automatically unloaded
All of their asses got struck
187 on my pistol
But it's a throwaway
Cop cars pull into the McDonald's
As I tried to get away
They said "We got the car surrounded"
"Come out with your hands up"
At this point I didn't give a fuck
It's going down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Murder weapon in my hands
Dead bodies I blast
Having the whole city sewed is a thing of the past
They want to negotiate my surrender
Knowing I ain't goin' out like that
I looked at 'em and cocked the gat
Flashbacks of bloody bodies and cemeteries
So I did what was necessary
And what was necessary was...
