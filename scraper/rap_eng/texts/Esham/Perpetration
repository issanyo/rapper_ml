Too much perping, it ain't working
Say ya getting pussy but ya dick ya jerking
Niggas be fronting, telling lies to these hoes
That's how it goes, well I suppose

They like it, they want it, shake it and flaunt it
Tease 'em and skeeze 'em, some never please 'em
Niggas they lying, perping and trying
To be the coolest, I think it's foolish

I think it's foolish, some nigga just died
Perped to ho's and ya don't know why
For goodness sake, for your sake, for any body's sake
Nigga you fake

Perpetration, same situation [4x]

Friends always make ends
Back in the day I had Adidas top tens
Pony down, can't fuck around
Niggas get shot down in Motown

Boy we was down since day one G
Bought yourself a key, now you don't know me
Gotta little money, now your attitudes funny
Pockets like sunshine, always sunny

Treat me funny, man go figure
You can take the nigga out the ghetto
But not the ghetto out the nigga
Niggas get funny, when they get money
Perping on yo homie

Now you wanna be fake, be fake
But when your broke ya break, brother
I ain't got no love for ya
Cause you be perping man

Perpetration, same situation [4x]

Lemme tell ya 'bout a bitch
A bitch ain't nothing, 24/7 all they good for is fucking
And once they get inside your head
Man you'd rather be dead, cause it'll drive you nuts

And I ain't fronting, I ain't fronting on that ho shit
You saying oh shit, just because I know shit
Pussy's like crack and it'll have a nigga hooked
Have a nigga slipping, shit gets over looked

A bitch a tell you I love you in a minute
And then the next day another nigga's up in it
Fucking your woman, nutting on her belly
Telling you about the peanut butter and the jelly

Damn, how a nigga know about that?
Another dog done went and chased that cat
And now you feeling dumb and full of frustration
Cause your bitch was perping

Perpetration, same situation [4x]
