Traces of my bloodtype
Was found at the scene of the crime
I didn't mean to blow that hoe god
I didn't mean to blow that stupid hoe god
But yo, ye
She had the nerve to say she had my baby
Yo this bitch must be crazy
Talkin bout how her baby got traces of my bloodtype
6 kids, fucked up hoe
Yo, traces of my bloodtype was found all over Jimmy Hendrix good tall
I spilled blood on some of Elvis's blue sway shoes
I guess that's why he a movie star
Traces of my bloodtype was found in the backseat of a 6 trade
Rag top Chevrolet
Homey don't play
Cause these are traces of my bloodtype

Traces of my blood type was found all across Jesus Christ
Got crucified on
Lived and died on
Suicide on
Traces of my bloodtype

Traces of my bloodtype was found at the scene of the crime
When Rodney King got beat
Malice Green got beat to death
Cause these are traces of my bloodtype
Cause life ain't nothin but a whiskey dream
Goin insane like Kurt Kobain
Blowin out my brains just to prove a point
That I ain't afraid to die
And why

Cause traces of my bloodtype was found everytime someone draws down
And the blood stains hit the ground
In the inner city
It ain't pretty
It's a disrespect for

And traces of my bloodtype are found at the seen of the crime
Some type of domestic violence
One person dead in silence
Cause she's a corpse now

And traces of my bloodtype are found at the post office
When that kid ran in there and shot those people
Just because his check didn't come on the third
Word

Traces of my bloodtype were found at the seen of the crime
Where Malcolm X got shot
And it's all still a conspiracy
But you don't hear me though

All I'm saying is life's fucked up
So when you uncover a couple blood stains
And they test it
And they find out its traces of my bloodtype
Then they'll know you did it
