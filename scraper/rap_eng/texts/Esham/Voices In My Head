[Intro]
You're better off dead
You're better off dead
You should kill yourself
You should kill yourself
You should kill yourself

[Verse 1: Esham]
I hear voices in my head, tellin' me go ahead
Somethin' in my mind says, I'm better off dead
13 ways and still countin' them down
Nine bodies floatin' in the river and never found
Seems like I'm drownin' in my own conception
I'm my worst enemy with no exception
Cross my heart, and hope to die in many ways
I look on the bright side, but there's no better days
Voices are callin' me, but I can't call 'em back
I drown my sorrows in a bottle of Cognac
People say what's the matter, the sounds of pitter patter
I'm losin' my mind as I'm walk up Jacob's ladder
Can I find sanity, you hear what I'm sayin', man?
Something keeps tellin' me to kill myself, god damn
They think I'm better off dead
But I'm losin' my mind, man
Cause I hear voices in my head

[Hook: Esham]
You're better off dead, you're better off dead (x4)
I hear voices in my head. You're better off dead (x3)
Oh Lord (Kill yourself)

[Verse 2: Esham]
I hear voices in my head, but I can't shut 'em up
Tellin' me to go to sleep in the tub, and never wake up
You want to talk to me, tell me somethin' I don't know
When the wind blows, they come but they never go
Lookie, lookie, lookie as I'm losin' my mad mind
Sanity and insanity seems intertwined
Russian Roulette cause I'm kinda upset man
Will I regret makin' a bloody silhouette?
Time will tell if I'm going to hell
Took the test of life and I believe I fail
Stop who's callin' me, I can hear you but can't see
Could it be Dr. Kevorkian or Derek Humphry?
Takin' the final step, the final exit's next
Doctor assisted suicide, it's so complex
The right to die is yours, you're better off dead
My mind's playin' tricks on me
Cause I hear voices in my head

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Esham]
I got the will to live but not the right to die
The voices tell me I live my life in a lie
I wanna get rid of me, myself, and I
Redrum's on my mind with no alibi
I got misconceptions of life itself
Everything I do, hazardous to my health
I got the witch on my back to catch a heart attack
Common sense I know, but common sense I lack
I got the symptoms of insanity drivin' me insane
Sendin' myself through pain as I walk in the rain
I try to close my eyes and say it's all a dream
Then the voices will whisper and then they start to scream
I grab my head in pain, I grab my gun again
Could it be I'm just lonely or just going insane?
I lay my head on the pillow inside a bloody bed
I got my gat in my hand, man
I'm a kill these voices in my head

[Outro]
I can't take it no more..
I can't take it, I'm going out my mind
I'm going out my..
Oh shit, fuck it, I'm gonna do it!
You're better off dead, anyway
