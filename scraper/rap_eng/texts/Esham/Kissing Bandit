Bitches never bitches
Cause they're never freaks
Cause they're never hoes 7 days a week
(x2)

[VERSE 1]
Bitches like niggas to dog them out
So I'm here to let you know what they're all about
Don't hesitate to smack her
She likes when you mack her
Play the Romeo role and she'll crush you like crackers
Nine days nights don't come twice
You get two for one at the same price
You gotta stay in control and on top
Or get dropped like potatoes
And here's how to be a real player
Mack on your ho
You've got to mack on your ho
You've got to dog out
And beat up
And smack on your ho
Bitch ain't nothing but meat on a stick
Only job in life is to please a dick
Don't ever let her forget that you run shit
And if she get out of line
That ass going to get kicked
Players got hoes for every day of the week
All under control and all like to freak
Bitch ain't nothing but nasty, sleazy
Neighborhood skeezy, way to easy
Be my ho and I'll be your pimp
Cool niggas strut, the [lame a ???] limp
Better make me money seven day's a week
And if somebody ask, you my freak
Because...

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
Yellow freaks like black dick daddy
So pull down your panties and show me that fanny
Your girl's a ho but still you claim her
Wild as a beast only I can tame her
She told me herself she liked the dick I threw
Hit the pussy so hard turned her ass black and blue
Add another to my collection
Her nigga was weak
Trying to fall in love, sucker with a stone cold freak
Bitches don't like that
That's why you mack on them
Kick them and punch them
And beat them and smack on them
All day, all night till they do you right
Cause a nigga like me'll just fuck your wife
For nothing
And nutting in her ass is my pleasure
Leave a dirty ass rubber in your room on your dresser
That's my trademark
I broke your wife's heart
But none of this would have happened if you macked from the start
Cause...

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
I'm the fucking kissing bandit in your neighborhood
I fuck your wife like she wish you would
When you come in, I leave out
I even got my set of keys to your house
She said I was the only man who made her cum right
While you were out cheating I was fucking her all night
No shame to my game, fuck dame after dame
You was loving her one night and she called you my name
See I dont give a fuck about your wife, you see
She ain't cheating on me
I'm the Ban-D-I-T
Who can resist, no ho can resist
Cause I'm the fucking Kissing Bandit and my dick is priceless
I might be your foe, I might be your boy
I know I fucked your ho and I brought her much joy
Cause..

[HOOK]

[VERSE 4]
I'm making bitches cum like rainy days
One wet pussy fucked a hundred ways
In less than an hour bitch is loving the thought of me
Her pussy so watery, I guess I ought to be
On my way, before I leave you say
I bring you joy and you wish I'd stay
But I can't, I got to roll, my job is done
Leave a rubber in your toilet full of cum
I'm the K-I-S-S-B-A-N-D-I-T
Fucking nigga's bitches is my fucking hobby
I leave it all sloppy like a beat up jalopy
And my style of fucking, your man can't copy
Having wet dreams
Scream, be a dream for Esham
Today it felt like rain, I made your ho cum
To sum it all up I'm a bad motherfucker
Turning innocent girls into freaky dick suckers
Today it's all loose and you dont understand it
Your girl got fucked by the Kissing Bandit

[HOOK]
