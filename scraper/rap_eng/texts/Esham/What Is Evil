The following program deals with controversial subjects, and due to it's explicit nature, parental guidance is strongly advised

The viewer is invited to make a judgement based on all available information

Most people agree that evil exists in this world
For some it's war, famine, or violence
For some it's a spiritual and for others evil is a very real presence a physical entity of terrifying power

What is evil?
Is it merely a dictionary definition for wrong or bad or is it something more, a deeper, darker force that makes people perform cruel or inhuman acts?
Does an evil force really exist that can attract and then control the actions of human beings or is evil nothing more than a convenient excuse for deviant and destructive behavior
These are questions without easy answers and are continually debated by those who study the human mind and the human spirit
