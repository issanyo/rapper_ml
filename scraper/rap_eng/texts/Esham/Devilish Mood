[INTRO]
I'm in a devilish mood (x2)

[VERSE 1]
You don't understand me
I got a split personality
Showing you a different side of reality
Late night walking down the street with a butcher knife
Cold jam it in your stomach and watch you vomit
Some say I'm sick, hard to get with
From the product, a psychotic nitwit
Redrum, Redrum
I got to get me some so where's my next victim
Little old lady walking down the block
Hit her in the back of the head with a rock
Dum dum ditty
Dum dum ditty dum dum
Redrum
Redrum, redrum
APB out on me
Killed the old lady
Took her Social Security
I'm living just like a pack rat
So if I see someone with some food
I say, "Give me that!"

[VERSE 2]
I'm living just like a pack rat
Sleeping on clothes and shit
Holes in my clothes
From sleeping outdoors
Cause Governor England took my food stamps
Got me living just like a tramp
A hobo, poor, living outdoors
Thrown on the streets
Now I'm sleeping on shelter floors
I resort to voodoo
I'm going to make me out a doll of Governor England, too
And put a pin in the middle of the forehead
While I say to myself, "Play dead!"
Homeless, I got no home
That's why when I see an old lady
I follow her ass home
People say I'm living just like an animal
I resort to eating people like a cannibal
Listen to the funky drummer
I get flashbacks and visions that I'm Jeffery Dahmer
Now I'm on the hunt for food
Cause I'm the homeless
I'm in a devilish mood

[VERSE 3]
I'm starvin' just like Marvin
So I'm going to get me a butcher knife and start carvin'
People up, what the hell
I'll get me some food, four walls if I go to jail
But even the jails won't take me
I got caught up in the system, breaking me
Breaking me down
Nervous breakdown
Cops found two dead bodies on the West side of town
Blame it on the homeless people
I hear no, see no, say no evil
Or should I just take my own life
One man starving, walking around with a butcher knife
Wish life like it was on TV
Maybe then somebody would help me
Or get me some food
Cause I got to survive
I'm in a devilish mood
