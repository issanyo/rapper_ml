[INTRO]
(Andrew Dice Clay samples)

[VERSE 1]
Born broke, beat up, and always honked at
Give me an Uzi and all you suckers get the fuck back
I'll bust your mind like a watermelon
And as you listen you'll find your brain swellin'
I'll go ooh so
Solo, who so dares compare themselves with death, die
Don't ask why my style is uncopyable
Some try, but they're just too sloppy, so
Thou shalt not come closer
Cause all the suckers who bite'll blow up like an explosive
I'll stamp a pentagram dead on your forehead
And as soon as you say a lyric you're dead
X marks the spot where your body falls
And then I'll grab your soul and roll, cause my duty calls
So all you suckers get the fuck out my way
When I drop the mic you'll say
Homey don't play

[SAMPLES]

[VERSE 2]
The U-N-H-O-L-Y, hell of a helly
I'm like the Devil in your body writing "Bite me!" on your belly
Like the Exorcist, the Devil's Groove keeps flowing
Turn out the lights and my body starts glowing
In neon, that's cause I'm beyond reality
The U-N-H-O-L-Y
There's a lot of evil minds
But only one Devil of a dog
Turning back on what you get, but don't forget
I hit like no other
You see my rhyme is like a pillow it's made to smother
Try to diss me I'm going to murder you
I never heard of a son of a gun, uh
And I'm going to kill uh, everyone of you
Something you've never seen
Put you in a guillotine
The psycho labeled me as a killer teen
When I drop the mic your parents pray
Get the fuck out my way
Cause Homey don't play

[SAMPLES]

[VERSE 3]
Break out the holy water, as I slaughter
You better change your last name
Cause I'm going in alphabetical order
And it won't stop cause I won't stop
With the tick-tick, a tick-tick
A tick-tock, a tick-tock
Can't you get it through your head
That it can't get no deffer cause my lyrics already dead
Hoping, wishing, praying
Someday I'll stop what I'm saying
But I can't, it seems like I'm possessed with something
The U-N-H-O-L-Y keeps my mind jumping
Get up, get down to the rhythm of death
Suckers thinking I'm taking a break
Them suckers falling every time I lose my breath
But still I don't stop to the beat
One time, one rhyme, and I still blew your mind
Everytime I drop the mic I bet everybody say
Homey don't fucking play

[SAMPLES]

[VERSE 4]
Everytime I kick shit it's labeled as Wicket Shit
Don't try to bullshit cause I'll fill you with bullets and shit
Rapping with my red head
Some say my brain's dead
Mocking what I'm rocking, then you're saying what insane said
Suckers are suicidal
Unholy is homicidal
I'm coming inside your mind and I'm taking your title
You wanna be me, but suckers can't see me
Cause I'm a ghostwriter
Funky funky fresh
Nevertheless I get my point across
I'm illing and illing's what I have to do
If you bite my lyrics I'm coming after you
Not physically but mentally
Rocking instrumentally
If you listen too hard it might kill you instantentionally
I can get indubitably until I see your mind work
Your thinking so hard
You're fake because your mind hurts
When you pass out you'll have to say
"I'm staying out that nigga's way, man!"
Cause Homey don't play
