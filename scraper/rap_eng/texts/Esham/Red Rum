Yeah, yeah, yeah (x8)

[VERSE 1]
Time to get ill
My mic starts to kill
Your head is falling apart and I start
To rebuild your mind
You're out of time
I'm out your mind
Like I said before, the heavy metal hardcore
Back to the groove line
And suckers try to move mine
The Seventh Sign of death
And death to the peace sign
I start to release mine
Now you got deceased mind
Shot another brother for holding up the peace sign
I got style, I got class
Try to diss me and I'll beat your ass
I don't say, I spray niggas allay
Like I said before, Homey Don't Play
Down on the East side my name is Esham
Rolling through your hood
And I'm ticking like a time bomb
Ready to blow up
Ready to go upside
Another nigga's head
For some shit he done said
A homicidal killer with a nine in my hands
Now you get to ride in the ambulance
Cause it's murder

[HOOK]
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum (x4)

[VERSE 2]
Dig this
A crazy brother on a crazy, crazy tip
Mother fuckers claiming raw
Boy you'll get pistol whipped
Whipping out my Mini Mag
Fucking niggas up
Bullet proof vest on my chest, now what's up
Doing it like a renegade
Sticks and stones is played
Who you think fucked up
I got a gun, you got a blade
I'm taking no shit
Reel Life Product's legit
You're fiending for my tape like a junkie wants a hit
Death is at your doorstep waiting on the one
The devil's in the shell and he's coming out a gun
Going off on niggas like I just based the pipe
Take a nigga's life
Cause I'm just the type
It's a dog-eat-dog world and I'm a pit bull
Any nigga jump crazy, bite his ass in a minute
I'm partners with the devil, taking nigga's on a hellraise
Brothers stinking, been dead for days
Beat your ass up, and leave you bleeding in the gutter
You said I was a sucker
Your mother
Now your dead with a busted head
No one's seen or even heard of you
Talking that trash you get a busted ass
No one fucks with a murderer

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
Homicide is my alias
Niggas don't diss cause they scared of us
I'm that nigga that makes your nightmares come true
I'm not dead, but I'm death
Can still haunt you
More like Jason but it's you I'm chasing
And once I catch you I'm icing and aceing
Running through your mind like Loki
And the reason you don't see me is cause I'm low key
I'm your Saturday shocker, horror flick routine
Showing you shit that you've never seen
Michael Myers, the crucifiers
My verse gets cursed when worse gets worse
Coming to get you
When I hit, you're done
Die and go to Hell and come back as my son
Died on wax with the killer tracks
Getting so dope I'm like a pound of crack
Homicide is on my side
Suicide tried to get to this side and died
My def jam plays like a boom, boom, boom
Sending out disses to whom it may concern
Brothers will learn
I take no time to burn
I murder

[HOOK]
