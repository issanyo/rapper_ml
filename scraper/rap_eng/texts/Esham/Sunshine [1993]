My Life in the sunshine, the sun don't shine too much on mine
But i feel funny wayss on sunny days, honey plays, money pays but keep in on sunny days
Used to be my baby, but now you just the neighborhood kid
And i'm thinkin bout' the things i did, just to make ya' happy
Scoop ya' scrappy, but listen to the nappy pappy
It's all about money, It's all about mo' money, and it's gettin mo funny
In the sunny days. I think about my wicked ways, juices got me crazed, so crime pays
Puttin' in work doin' my dirt, and I'm the one that ends up gettin hurt
Just for a peice a' puss', a peice of bush, and now the next man's gettin tha' toosh
I Guess i know next time, but for now i'm just losin' my mind, cause' I'm caught up in the sunshine
Chours
(Samples: My life My life, in the sunshine)
In the sunshine, I'm fellin' kinda' mellow, watch the crackhead say hello
I'm just a little ghetto boy ghetto child, runnin' wild with the freestyle
I dropped out a school to clock papers
Now when the niggas see me, they clock vapors
Watchin' them Dayton's hit the sunlight, so i hold my gun tight
Everybody out to get me, see my minds playin tricks with me, so don't bullshit me
I used to have some homies, but see i dissed all my homies, so now i'm kinda' lonely
But it's all about me, but it's too head for me ta' see, through my jealousy
A nigga caught me slippin at a red light, 2 shots/2 shots to my dome, now i'm dead right
Through thick and thin homies should stay tight
Thats all i was thinkin' bout', With my brains blew out
In the sunshine
Chours
In the sunshine, niggas feel good, smokin herbs, chillin in the hood
Shoot a little dice, fuck a little hoe, and then some nigga try to rob the liquir store
They shot em' in the back on the way out, like a sucka' what a way to go out
Tried to steel some bread to feed his babies, they said crack babies neighborhood crazy
Now i guess the babies don't eat, bloody daddies head dead in the street
And their ain't no rainbows where the cocaine flows
Thats where ya' go when you try to behave hard
I guess he'll know next time
But his babies losin' they minds, in the sunshine
Chours
