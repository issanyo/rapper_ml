Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty

Hey sexy, love that walk
Hey sexy, love that talk
Hey sexy, dont you know
That you are just a freaky ho
Can we get together now
Do you know what, cuz I know how
Ain't no kinda frontin honey
I want the cunt and money
I did'nt eat breakfast but I'll take a little nuttin honey
I know your booty's round, I got no coodie's hoe
If we get busy then I got to put my footie's down
It's not  ? plan, it's just a one night stand
I'm not a groupie and I dont wanna be your man
I'm not all in, baby quit callin
Me a pervert, and quit stallin
Bottom line can I nut on ya chest
All you gotta do is say yes
And be my...

(CHORUS)
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty

Hey sexy, would you blow
On my dick and make it grow
If you want to, tell me so
My dick starts growin like Pinnachio's nose
Freak me, Freak me, baby doll
Ride this dick for a little while
In and out and round and round
Givin you more than just a pound
I like chocolate with extra cream
Dont fuck ho's who like to feind
It's no fun if the honey's dont scream
N-A-T-A-S it's a tag team
Freak nasty, all upset
Cuz she didn't get her pussy wet
Let me nut all on yo chest
All you gotta do is say yes
And be my...

(CHORUS)
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty

Hey baby, let's hit the motel
If you bring the pussy everything a go swell
I got the condom's, always gotta bang wit em
Bitches, I'm baggin em'
Break out the Magnum, condoms
Cuz I'm not dumb
And if you dont use a condom, you dumb
Hey baby, baby, baby, bet you dont know
If pussy was a sport I'd be all pro
Bitches on my dick cuz I'm good to go
Your man got the money but I'm dickin his ho

(CHORUS)
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Freak nasty, freak nasty
Hey baby, hey sexy
Hey baby, hey sexy.....
