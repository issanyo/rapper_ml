(Esham)
12 in the morning
Woke up with the shakes
Serial killa, Mr. Frosted Flakes
My hands were all bloody
And I don't know why
I'm thinkin bout my bitch
And why she had to die
Some niggas out to get me
She settin me up
They pulled out they pistols
Started wettin me up
I seen my life pass before my eyes in a flash
I drew down my weapon
And I started to blast
My bitch caught a slug in the back of the neck
I emptied out the tech
And niggas hit the deck
I ran for the beamer
It was sittin in front
I left my bitch's body smokin like a philly blunt
And it was

(CHORUS)
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, it all happened
In the midnight hour
In the midnight hour, they started cappin

I'm bleeding like a motherfucker
Grabbin my chest
My heartbeat racin' like a EMS
I called my partner up on the portable phone
I blew my bitch brains out with the chrome
My nigga said he'd meet me at the Omni hotel
Court date was today
And he just jumped bail
Police out to get him
He was under arrest
Bitch warrant for my nigga
With the mental stress
Met my nigga at the spot
And he had nothin to say
Metro airport to East L.A
When we got the city
It was drama again
Seen a nigga that we jacked in '89 for 10
And it was

(CHORUS)

The nigga started trippin
He was wavin his gun
Pissed off since '89
Cause we murdered his son
Stray bullets started flyin
Everywhere but in mine
Still bleedin like a pig
And I'm pressed for time
I looked up and my nigga caught a slug in his face
Now I'm madder than a motherfucker
Tryna embrace
My homie body turned cold
I felt him slippin away
He was just here alive
Now he dead today
And the nigga who had shot him
He was shot on the floor
So I went to his body
And I shot him some more
He looked me dead in the face
And said you're going to hell
I spit blood in his face as I started to yell

(CHORUS)(2x)

They started cappin
In the midnight, in the midnight hour
