[INTRO]
Red, black, and green, you know what I mean?
The White Devil did all this shit
This is Judgement Day
Jesus Christ is black
This is Judgement Day
Jesus is white with blonde hair and blue eyes
This is Judgement Day
Do black people get in heaven, mommy, huh?
This is Judgement Day
And as leader of the KKK, kill all niggers!

[VERSE 1]
Judgement day
666 sins
No time to pray
So don't say amen
We're headed for Armaggedon
I'm bleeding like I'm sweating
As I walk the flatlines
We're running out of time
Dead by day is what I said
Sometimes though
I'd rather be dead is what I said
So take it slow
Time to pay back
So hit the playback
Visions of killing preachers in a psychotic flashback
God's going to get me
Is what they told me a minute ago
The Fallen Angel
Strangled several
And in that time I learned one thing, jack
Follow the Yellow Brick Road
And don't look back
Now they're trying to get me
But I'm going to get you first
The Unholy is dead
So now I think it's much worse
Good and evil collide
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Put them together and you get another homicide
Suicidal tendencies tend to get in the way
Face your sins
Armageddon, it's Judgement Day

[HOOK]
Day of Judgement, God is calling
Hand of God has struck the hour

[VERSE 2]
Thou shalt not sin
So I grin as I sing a song
Who the fuck are you
To tell me what's right and wrong
Death is in my eyes
I wear no disguise
You're going to pay for those little white lies
No more Mr. Nice Guy
I'm fixing to bust
When I said fuck [BACKWARDS AUDIO]
I was disgusted
But you can't trust it
Cause I can't trust it
Reverend Swaggart
The preacher, busted
You're going to Hell for all your sins
Pins and needles
Needles and pins
Voodoo doctor on the rocks with vodka
The preacher got busted with a whore
Got'cha
Man on the moon but still can't fly right
Now he's going to fake his death
And can't die right
Selling Bibles on the corner
But you'll pay
For all your sins
It's Judgement Day

[HOOK]
Day of Judgement, God is calling
Satan laughing spreads his wings
Oh Lord, yeah

[VERSE 3]
You motherfucking sinner
Lying ass bitch
Stealing from the poor
Just to get rich
Judgement Day
You're going to pay
And you'll burn
They're going to tie your ass to a stake
And let you burn
For all that punk ass shit you tried
(VOCALIZING)
("Praise the Lord!")
Bitch be quiet!
Cause you can't brainwash me
I'm not brain dead
You're better off taking two to the head
Judgement Day
Armageddon is on its way
Now the last thing you want to do is pray
You say you're sorry for all those things you did
But that don't work
You say you're sorry for all those souls you stole
But that don't work
You say you're sorry for stealing that money out the collection plate
Now meet your fate
It's Judgement Day

[OUTRO]
Satan laughing
Oh Lord, yeah
This is Judgement Day
