[Verse 1:]
No singing at my funeral, I can't stand to see you break down
So when I die, place me in my coffin face down
Don't wanna hear no preacher preachin' all that razzmatazz
Place me face down so you can walk and kiss my black azz
Leave me butt naked but don't make it a closed coffin
Cause if you do, I'll come back and haunt you kinda often
But tell that bitch singin'
We Shall Overcome, to drop it
I make faces out of place so you oughta stop it
Well as I look up at the people lookin' down at me
It's kinda sad to see, so take me out my misery
I hear some hummin' and some people singin' sad songs
Where did I go wrong, sad songs last long
I can hear the preacher sayin' good things about me,(Esham!)
People cryin' as they readin' my obituary
Hush little baby, don't say a word
Sometimes it's best to be seen and not heard
For those of you who don't know
For those of you who don't know
For those of you who don't know
I hate sad songs, so no singing at my funeral

[Interlude:]
He was so.. he was a good child
He was a good child
Why did he have to go?

[Verse 2:]
Well it's the same ole sad song
I sing that mad song
I say it won't last long, tellin' y'all be strong
Layin' on my back
I can see all the misery
Thus accompany
I can hear you but I'm dead so don't sing to me
Now you wanna sing me a lullaby but you make another cry
And I'm just another guy who wanna die
Peacefully, so don't sing to me
Just let me be and I'll rest in peace
It's like a one way ticket to hell and I bought one
Nothing for sale but a cold and I caught one
For those of you who don't know
I hate sad songs so no singing at my funeral

[Interlude:]
He was a good boy
Why he gotta play the game of death
He gettin' up!
Oh shit, he gettin' up!

[Verse 3:]
Up's a daisy, time for me to get up
Niggas get lit up, when I test shit up
Ain't no singin' so get that shit straight
Bitches go think about me so they masturbate
No singing at my funeral, to let you know
Esham's dope ho and never so so
The black devil get's funky in the joint
And fuck the police at east point
Young mutha fuckin' ass rebel
Call me unholy or the black devil
Esham's ain't nothing to fuck with
And if you talkin' some shit, you betta duck quick
Cause niggas still dyin' to be down
With a thoroughbred, they can't fuck around
It gets hectic enough to make your heart sick
I light 'em up quick just like a candle stick
I'm not a convict so fuck politics
I'm not Catholic, but a lunatic
But I'ma set all that shit aside
I'm not blond hair or blue eyed like Bonnie & Clyde
I'ma take you for a joy ride
And if you slip-n-slide, you'll get cockeyed
Blood stains all on the rhythm for you punk
Niggas die, when I drop the funk
Suckas always tellin' me
To put a gun to they head and take them out they misery
It ain't no sweat off my back
You'll get done whether white or black
I try but I hesitate
Cause if I do a chump like you I'll be up state
Kill or not to kill the only life I know
But if you gotta go you gotta go
Ain't no time for all that
Play dead and take two to the forehead
Nobody knows when they gonna go
So if you gotta go, I guess you betta not know
I think you better listen to me
We all get something out of life and that's a guarantee
Whether poor or rich, you wanna know why
Life's a bitch, because we guaranteed to die
