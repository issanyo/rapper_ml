Runnin' wit' 5 lane bros, seein' things. Here's ya intro
To acid hallucinagenics. Human beings... Y'all 12 rap on that
I take this war shit deeply
You should be avoiding my recording
I take this war shit deeply
'Cuz murder's my rewarding [2x]
So many trials and tribulations
Havin' wicked conversations
With God and Satan, thug and desperation
So many killas across the nation
Live in anialation, but I'm ready to kill some shit
Mental patient, impatient
Watch me change the situation wit' this murder demonstration
When I blow your ass away when you out free-basin'
Still runnin' up in the race, facin' racists
Just racin', comtemplatin' suicide still idle time wastin'
Still a Nation Ahead of Time And Space
If you ride wit' me you might end up in a police chase
I don't recommend the Wicked Shit for you
You just a ho, and you can't do what I do
It's hard to perform under these circumstances
Watch the devil when he dances
You'll need an ambulances, puttin' em in trances
Hypnotize, watch you wake up when I snap my fingas
Open ya eyes, open ya eyes
I take this war shit deeply, peep me
Never hang where the weak be
Always woke, never sleepy
I keep the uzi and I'll wet you like a jacuzzi
Kick shit like a Suzuki, hit you wit' the Horuki
Niggas get that cash up
Hoes bounce that ass up
Niggas get that cash up
Hoes bounce that ass up
I shoot a little 'caine
Stressed the fuck out
Keep the heat on me at all times
So my shirt it kinda stuck out
Don't make me draw down and buck out
'Cuz where I'm from when the guns bust
They leave ya fuckin' guts out
So many rules and regulations
Bein' broke, death by speculation
The world's fascination with self afflicted mutilation
How can I obtain the power through manifestation
Immortalized and bomb mummification
Peep the translation, check communications
Run at top secret operations
