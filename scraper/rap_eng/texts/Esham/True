[VERSE 1]
I'm buzzing
I need some True
Not like the shit that you smoke that you grew
Straight from Jamaica where the green grass grows
Cop me some Tops and I'm ready to go
Rolled me a big fat bat of the True up
Hide my bag when I call the crew up
Blaze my J and take a strong toke, then...
Choke off the True smoke
But ain't no thang
I'm game to take another puff
And as I smoke I say, "Damn this is good stuff!"
I can roll a J in 3 seconds flat
At a baseball game I be blazing a bat
It's cool, I'm cool
Smoke a J in the can
No homegrown please, just straight up 'Ghan
Keep a Bic in my pocket cause I'm ready to flick
Keep the True in my drawers by my balls and my dick
If you try to smoke me out you'll be straight up lit
I smoke the type of shit you can't fuck wit'
True

[VERSE 2]
If you take a strong toke it'll turn your lungs blue
And that fresh smelling True green grass is on you
No telling how much True I consume
The shit's so potent you'll catch a contact in the next room
When I blaze, it's just like smog
Niggas wake up in the morning and think it's early morning fog
I gotta have it, gotta smoke it, gotta have it
I can afford to be blowed
Cause my lifestyle's lavish
True's in the house when I walk in the place
Blaze up a J and blow smoke in your face
My lifestyle's wild
I could never go wrong
And I smoke more True than Cheech & Chong
True

[VERSE 3]
I gotta get some more True cause my bag's getting low
Jump in the ride headed for the True store
Give me a pound of your best Sensimill'
Since I come everyday you ought to hook me up a deal
Just then the cops had to raid the place
So I puffed on my J and blew smoke in their face
They put us in the cop car
Me, my man Jack, and Pete
Blazing up True in the back seat
The cop jumped in and he wasn't joking
He said, "Go to jail...or give me that shit you was just smoking!"
I said, "Cool" and didn't even think about it
As for the True
Never leave home without it
True
