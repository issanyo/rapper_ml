[Intro]

[Hook]
All the muthafuckin' drugs in the world can't heal these sick little boys and girls
X4

[Verse 1]
Vicodin, Codeine, Dimethyltryptamine
At the Methadone clinic trying to get some Morphine
Crack fiend, Caffeine, trying to stay clean
Making false promises to Narcotics Anonymous
Get so schizo, doctors get rich, yo
Off mental illness
Writing prescriptions
There's no solution then
For these hallucinogens
Just a hooligan rockin' to Max Julien

We all live in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine

Propofol, Demerol
Man they want to kill us all
Just like Michael Jackson, and get us off the wall

Chemical imbalance, eat your molecules
Forensics, drug tests, and hair follicles

Get it in, Ritalin, tell me what he did again
Oh no, he on that crazy shit again

Pill, pill, pillin' him
You know they killin' him

That's why they just keep refillin' him

[Hook]
All the muthafuckin' drugs in the world can't heal these sick little boys and girls
X4

[Outro]
Life is not a video game
You can't push reset
When you get killed in real life you die
And it ain't no comin' back
