(Intro)
Fellatio, yo, yo, yo, yo yo
Fellatio, yo, yo, yo, yo yo
Fellatio, yo, yo, yo, yo yo
Fellatio, fellatio baby
It feels so good, yo

(Verse 1)
Twelve gauge, road rage
Watch me dive right off the stage
Into the sea of life where youth will never age
Body hammerin', street lobotomy, sodomy
Cut the ratio, female fellatio
With my nine inch nail
I wanna fuck you like an animal
Cannibal, straight out the bush of the jungle
Early bundles to the [?] never fumbles
Sticky glue gets crumbled
Wanna rumble
Is it girls against boys
Lets make some noise
Out here you only got one choice
That's to enjoy every minute, ever hour
And devour all cowards
Thrustin' through the galaxy
I only move forward sayin'

(Hook)
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha

(Verse 2)
[?], let me spark this, let me start this
Regardless of Viagra, still the hardest rap artist
Microwave, road rage, rave back to your cave
Unless you be livin' in the Home of the Brave
S&M, bring your mama and her friends
S&M, bring all your horny friends
I'm a part of this, just like you
I'm a disciple of NATAS with work to do
I'll bide you, guide you, hard slip inside you
Back, front, I know what you want
Someone to hide you
Pump, jump, get it crunk
Gang bangers love to dump
Down with work, or so watch my universal slump

(Hook)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha
Sayin' ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha
