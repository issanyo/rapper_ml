In these times of hurt and pain
We need a remedy to take us from the rain
A little hunger, a little greed
I been thinking 'bout what I need
I need a freak to hold me tight
I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak, someone like you
I need a freak cause freaks are people too
I need a freak to suck my dick
I need a freak baby, muthafuck a trick
I need a freak, my own private hoe
I need a freak to work that pussy fast and slow
I need a freak, my baby doll
I need a freak when I'm ridin' 7 Mile
I need a freak, someone like you
I need a freak cause freaks are people too
I need a freak to get me served
I need a freak to calm my nerves
I need a freak to roll my weed
I need a freak, that's what I need
I need a freak
I need a freak
I need a freak
I need a freak
