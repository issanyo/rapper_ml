[HOOK]

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
It's a new day
A true day
A sky blue day
It's a new life
One-way ticket to Paradise
But where you come from
Straight out of Hell, son
You can't tell from the smoke
And the smell, son
The Devil's upset
He won't be backing it
These niggas going crazy
They don't know how to act in it
(You might have everything figured out)
But me, see
I took a different route
I didn't go to church
The preacher's not my friend
Me and my fifth-grade teacher
We having sex again
Only essay I ever wrote
Was  a Mexican
I'm knockin' on Heaven's doors
But the won't let me in
They say you're from Detroit
You're Hell-bound
They got me feeling like [Case?]
Almost spellbound
Am I alive or dead
I can't tell now
All  I got is my soul left
For sale now

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2:  MASTAMIND]
It's a new life
I'm just trying to do right
You know, do what I do
And let you say who's nice
Who's your favorite
Who cares, you can save it
I'm on some getting paid shit
Not to be played with
Love it or hate it
From the city where the Devil's busy
I'll be damned
If I let these suckers outlive me
Stay on my toes
Even when I'm tipsy
No label to give me no category
You could fit me
I say "fuck it" everyday
So ain't no pity
Knockin' on Hell's doors
Like they know it's me
Why do I feel so D-E-A-D
When I been spittin' shit so crazy lately
Alive and well
Feel like killing myself
Feel like I'm on death row
Inside a cell
Just spittin' truthfully
As I usually do
Fuck the foolery
It ain't like it used to be
Say hello to the new me

[AMBIENT DIALOGUE]

[OUTRO]
Yeah, it's that new shit
It's a new day
You know me
The only thing I want old
Is some motherfucking money
I'm all with the new-new
Droppin' that new shit
That doodoo
Funkier than a motherfucker
Newer than a motherfucker
Just waking up
The afterlife
