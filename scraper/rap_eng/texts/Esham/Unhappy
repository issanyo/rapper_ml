A-1 Yola
15a - Unhappy
"(I was dreamin' when I wrote this, so don't quote this. Watch me flow this.)

[Verse 1]
UNHAPPY...
When you live your life in misery
And you so blind
Can't see
Nothin' but sufferin'
Tired of strugglin'
Hustlin'
Barely gettin' by
I can't lie
Sometimes it make me wanna cry
Hold back the tears inside
Keep all my fears inside
And my pistol by my side
So much anger and aggression

From manic-depression

I grab my Smith & Wesson
This is just another lesson
I feel like God is testin'
I'm steady askin' questions
'Cause I'm unhappy

[Chorus]
Unhappy (x19)
UNHAPPY...

[Verse 2]
When you unhappy like me
A problem's never solved
You never get involved
The whole world revolves
Around doctor's diagnosis
With symptoms of insanity
Mental casualty
It's sad to see another tragedy
Blasphemy
Thinkin' too deeply
Forever sleepy
A subliminal criminal
In the darkness, you can't beat me
Pacsel
Lithium pills
Benadryl
Askin' God to forgive me
I guess this how I was sent to feel
When he unhappy

[Chorus]
Unhappy (x19)
UNHAPPY...

[Verse 3]
I'm sick and tired of bein' sick and tired
Fallin' in fire
Feels like my body is wrapped in barbed wire
I don't give a f**k no more
And I just can't take no more
How the f**k am I supposed to not to bake a cake no more?
And the only thing that's left is love
'Cause I can't hate no more
So, if you gonna kill me, do it
'Cause I just can't wait no more
Rappers dyin' from rapid fire
It just ain't safe no more
Time waits for no man
And I just can't waste no more
Steady lookin' at my mistakes
I can't erase no more
Demons fallin' from the sky
This ain't no holy place no more
God, I swear I'll never put you in second place no more
'Cause I don't wanna see that look on your face no more
Drugs, I don't chase no more
That ain't the case no more
And I finally don't wanna be a disgrace no more
A guinea pig to this world's rat race, no more
Russian Roulette in the face with a .44
I'm unhappy

[Chorus]
Unhappy x19)
UNHAPPY..."
