I feel sorry for all you niggas out there
That ain't making no money
1987

[Hook]
It's time to make another million
What, nigga
It's time to make another million
I don't think you heard me
It's time to make another million
A million dollars, bitch

(Verse 1)
I be the insane nigga, with the migraine headache
Stressed out, having million dollar doubts
Nigga wonder, am I blind like Stevie Wonder?
This system trying to take me under
My whole team pops 'Scalines
No more triple beam dreams or amphetamines
I got a problem with the FBI
I'm always like fuck them, motherfuck them
I made a million dollars, and got the fuck out of Detroit
Niggas hate me there, they want to kill me
Player haters can't feel me
I'm underground, so check the sound
You won't catch me on your radio dial
So fuck that shit, and bump this shit
If you ain't with this shit, suck a fat dick
You old broke ass, ho ass, never getting no cash

(HOOK)

(Verse 2)
Hold up, wait a minute
Your radio ain't shit if my tape ain't in it
So now I'm going all out
And I'm going to smoke on the gans, 'til I fall out
You can't stop my flow, hell no
If you's a ho, you gots to go
Street politician, connection with chickens
The night before Christmas, popped Charles Dickens
Can't nobody do it like me, I'm the incredible Bruce Wayne
Please, last of the red hot blooded MC's
Nigga nigga what, smack your bitch's booty while I'm busting a nut
My flow is ill like a virus
My words speak out to a thug like Cyrus
Kidnap your mind, then hold it for ransom
The murder I wrote, is a suicide note, and

[Hook]
