[Intro]
I say all the institutions have failed us
The Church has failed
The School has failed
The Government has failed
The Home has failed

[Verse 1: All]
(TNT)
Up early Sunday morning
(Mastamind)
I'm about to do some dirt
(Esham)
My Bible's kind of bloody, shotgun put in work
(Mastamind)
I heard my heater talking to me
He was talking to me saying, "Blaz4me"
(Esham)
And my mad mind flipped kind of drastically
(TNT)
Buck, buck, buck goes the shells
(Mastamind)
That's quicker than you can tell
(Esham)
I'm sending a nigga to hell
(TNT)
Don't say shit when I blast on your dome
(Mastamind)
Cause my nickel plated chrome got a mind of it's own
(Esham)
He wants me to wet them, so I let him
Talk me into putting them, slugs right in you
(TNT)
Damn, I'm talking to the gun in my hand
He wants me to understand
(All)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

[Hook]
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
Blaz4me
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
My shotgun said,  "Blaz4me"
I'm going to fuck this whole town up
Blaz4me
I'm going to fuck this whole town up

[Verse 2: All]
(Esham)
Now I'm running down the street with a gun in my hand
My shotgun said, "Can we murder a man?"
(Mastamind)
I hear voices in my head, telling me to do things
Once I see a cop, then I start the shooting
(Esham)
It's routine every day I hear shots in my ear
I wish they'd go and just disappear
(TNT)
I see the blood squirting, as I do my dirt
And niggas getting killed, so you better call it curtains
(Mastamind)
A bloody mess, I'm going out my mind, I find
Myself talking to my shotgun, all the time
(TNT)
It's kind of crazy, but the more I stop and think
(Esham)
Hey yo, it's time to get my dick out the sink
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: All]
(Mastamind)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"
So I blast, right
(TNT)
It's the middle of the night, I feel a lot of hype
(Mastamind)
I had a dream, I had a bad dream, now it's real
(Esham)
It said, "Wake up, motherfucker and pass me the steel"
(Mastamind)
Let me peel, thou shalt not kill, but I'm ill
(TNT)
Cops on my heels, got me running through the ville
(Mastamind)
They got a gun to my head, then my gun said
(Esham)
"Blast quick, or get your ass kicked till' you're dead"
(Mastamind)
Yo, bet your ass, I'll be blasting that ass like an assassin
(TNT)
[?] 'em off the Earth in a devilish fashion
(Mastamind)
I don't give a fuck, so you better duck
When you're coming at me
(Esham)
Peel 'em back, G
(Mastamind)
My shotgun said, "Blaz4me"

[Hook]
