[Esham]
Light years away, you can't glitch with this
So I can't resist to put you in a twist
You hurtin' this, I just ain't understandin'
Plannin' capers like a villain, you know I'm underhanded
Hand in your resignation you ain't representin'
Get a lyrical impeachment like your man Bill Clinton
If you know like I know, and you flow to get dough
We used to be toe to toe
Now we stay cracked like cee-lo
Oh no, you think you sound like the old Motown?
But I'm from New Detroit we make the world go round boy

Chorus (Uncredited Girls):

We make the World spin around
Talkin' bout Motown
We make the girls scream out loud
Tell me how it's goin' down
We cruise around and around
We cruise around and around

[Esham]
We got the fastest cars and the prettiest women
If you catch me underwater boy I won't be swimmin'
If you got a fat bush, girl it's just for trimmin'
Black girls with blonde hair like Lil' Kim'n
I be the E-S-H-A-M and, corners I'm bendin'
No need for pretendin', Charlie Batch I'm winnin'
Detroit Lions and Tigers, Geoffrey Fieger, my style's Kevorkian
Sting you like a scorpion with this lyrical torturin'
A seven in my Elly rider, who you tellin'
I come from o-z sellin' straight bailin'and real life yellin'
And time warp til' nowadays

[Crowd claps to fade]
