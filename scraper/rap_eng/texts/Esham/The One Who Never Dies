[INTRO]

[VERSE 1:  ESHAM]
Don't nobody love me
How could I say that
I ain't 'cha homey, you know
Homey don't play that
Still the same crazy mofo from way back
James Brown, this The Big Paypack
Wheel of Fortune, black Pat Sajak
Pushing that Vanna White
Make sure my Phantom's white
Or is it all just a big fa√ßade
A mirage pulling out of my garage
Looking in my rear view
I get a clear view
I can't hear you
I know don't nobody love me
I know don't nobody love me
I get a kick out of life
When life's kicking me
That's why I make these motherfuckers
Out here sick of me
I know don't nobody love me
I know don't nobody love me
So you go can and tell niggas
I said go to Hell
And fuck everybody wanting you to go to jail
And you can act hard
Fuck your Rap God
If he can't even get your shit to sell
You niggas spineless and moral-less
Look in the mirror in your own eyes
Realize you're a bitch
So you can pray to that
You wanna pay me back
Come put seventeen slugs in my D hat

[INTERLUDE]

[VERSE 2:  ESHAM]
And I don't got to parties
Nigga fuck everybody
You heard what I said
Tattoo that shit on my head
Go ahead tell everybody
That you number two
You know I'm number one
Nigga, fuck is wrong with you
And I don't give a fuck who you thinks the greatest rapper
I'm Jason Voorhees, The Final Chapter
Rappers scared of the Wicketshit
Wasn't prepared when I did this shit
They bit this shit since
N-A-T-A-S carved their name in your chest
With a rusty razor blade
I'll forever be paid
Forever fly
Never die
Heaven's in the sky
Hell is down on Earth
Tell me what your life's worth
No way to be an angel 'round a bunch of devils
You couldn't dig it even 'round a bunch of shovels
Inside my astral plane I'm on another level
Heavy mental
Heavy hitter
Heavy Metal
