My dick don't lie so if I'm lying I'm dyin'
I spent my last on some ass I'm thinkin' should I keep buyin'
Please don't get me to reminiscing
Why you think your hoe's missin'? I got her ass in position
Here we go with the flow again
Ho after ho again
You sleeping on your bitch, my man we's about to roll again
Who's fucking who?, I'm fucking her cause she said fuck you
I'm doing her till she's done and drop her off when I'm through
Give her back to you but you don't wanna keep her
You rather let her roll with the late night creeper
She's whispered in my ear with a secret
"Mastamind he mistreats me, he beats me, he hates to eat me; can you help me?"
You best to help yourself see
You and that nigga with that sick dick better get some therapy
I can't do nuthin' but hear your problems and woes
So watch the doors as they close, yo this is what my mind says

[Esham]
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho
(this is what my mind says)
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho

[Mastamind]
Momma said never love a ho, make a ho make your dough
I'll break a ho if she takes me for some kind of John Doe
Yo I don't think so, I got some shit built up on my mind
In time, you'll find trickin' is a crime
I'll let the next nigga trick with you
Bitch you'll get the dick in your mouth
A devilish nigga knock your ass out
Say ho TKO in the first
Now how you like me when I'm mad at the world ready to burst?
So don't fuck with me if you ain't from Detroit city
I got my dick in your mouth, bout to whip it on your titty
That dirty minded Mastamind's is in your ear
The most devilish player of the year dick is here

[Esham]
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho
( this is what my mind says )
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho

[Mastamind]
It's all in your head, you better off dead
I know you need to be fed but I can't give you your daily bread
So die bitch, die ho, you fuckin' with a psycho pimp
I'm fatally attracted don't get your ass kicked
And don't attempt to get inside mind cause my mind says no
My mind says I could never learn to love a ho
Momma said don't call that trick a ho, call that bitch a slut
Like everyday I'm back in that ass for another fuck
She spends her spare time dick lickin' and trickin'
Waiting for me to stick this wicked dick in
Oh no, you know I won't do that so, I'm out the door
I left your ass in ninety four, hey yo

[Esham]
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho
( this is what my mind says)
My mind says stop, my mind says go, my mind says I could never learn to love a ho
Hey yo this is what my mind says
