[Esham]
Mama was a junkie, sometimes I used to wonder
Whether she would better of a live or six feet under
Late nights go by no sleep, born into a junkies world
Its so deep
Crack pipes, crack valves, cracked up person
Somedays its bad and otehr days much worst
Used to never go to sleep in fear, trying to hid the pain
And front like i didn't care
The neighborhood knew just what had happen to me
At night they said the devil was rappin to me
But on the streets I could feel my mothers heartbeat
And everytime she gets frightened, It quickly repeats
The way a junkie lives and what the junkie gives
Hard times, and problems and stress with their own kids
No sense in rehibilation, growing up in humilation
The aroma of base makes me choak. I could almost
Die of the crack smoke. Different men, going out
And coming in and in my eyes I witnessed the first
Peoples sin, and I was only three, they thought i couldn't
See. But in my eyes Momma was a junkie

[Chorus]
[Esham]
J-U-N-K-I-E to me some close their eyes and try not to
See. But you can still smell the sin just as well my
Mothers unconscience and trapped in hell
Now here life is on line (line)
Stuck to the grind(grind)
Time after time(time)
Shes on my mind(mind)
Im thinking how could this happen to my mother not me bro
But some nigga in my hood is slangin kilos
He's got a spot around the corner fucked up crib
Lord forgive her for all the things she did
Im thinking where was the police when she was
Buyin this, but i know that the police could
Give a fuck less. about a another basehead
In the street. But they rather pretend they dont see it
When they walk the beat, a black cop ain't good for shit
But black male and he knows that my mothers out there
Smoking yale, but black cops are blind they can't see
Because in my eyes momma was a junkie

[Chorus]
[Esham]
Mama lived the fast life, pregnant at 14
Back in those days it wasn't crack it was heroin
Shot it in her viens to try to ease the pain
An unplanned pregnancy was made then I came
Straight from the wound to witness my mama's doom
In and my heard, i knew it that its coming soon
Of all these junkism nieghborhood critisizm
Her mind was gone, i felt she needed a exorcism
Speedballin booze and the fast times pretty soon
My mama lost her whole fucking mind, adc welfare
Recieptent, three children, not enought defadent
Few good times, only badtimes and worst from speedballin
Her motherfuckin bursts. I wish i coulda said I love you
Before she left, now my mind forever haunted with my
Mama's death, I asked my self how could this happen to
Me my mother o.d. cuz my mama was a junkie

[Chorus]
