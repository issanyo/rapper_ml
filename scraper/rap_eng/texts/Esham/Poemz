[Verse 1: Razzaq]
I'm hanging like scrotum sacks
Doing drive-bys in Cadillacs
Smoking niggas while they smoking buddha sacks
Niggas getting wet up like stamps
I'm blowing out brains as quick as I'm blowing out amps
It's like nasty ass no good hookers
I got bullets ripping through car doors, amps & subwoofers
When I was a little boy drinking Hi-Cs
I was murdering Capricorns, Libras and Pisces
I sees my neighborhood sewed up, hold up
Got slowed up, enemies get dropped for showed up
Pitbulls gets blown up with no delay
I blew away my next door neighbor's Bouvier
Careless, juicin motherfuckers like spare ribs
In Detroit sticking up stores owned by Arabs
Before I was born twice, from knowledge to torn
I smoked a nigga for blowing his horn
Chaotic, never nervous
Smoking a nigga of the Internal Revenue Service
While some niggas I know be flipping keys
I be flipping on motherfuckers at Mickey Ds

Deep, deep below...through the muck and the snow
Fear is found below...through the muck and the snow

[Verse 2: Esham]
Woke up sweating bullets
My vision is Brillo
Sleep with the .357 up under my pillow
I have dreams of bullets coming up at me in my direction
Tied down to the bed for my own protection
Institutionalized, I metamorphosize
Into Jesus, tied down and I'm crucified
The devil burns me
Holy water makes my skin blister
He slit my wrist cause I'm a Suicidalist
I seen many faces of death
Dead men don't sing no songs
No singing at my funeral
Visions of my burial
Closed casket, six feet, born dead at birth
How much is my life worth
If I'm under the Earth
Psychiatric treatment, therapeutic, help me dispute it
It's coincidental what goes on in my mental
I have cravins' of black ravens on my tombstone
So you can sleep if you can
I'm having dreams of a dead man

Dead men don't sing
Dead men DO dream
About being alive
You know, all the way live

[Verse 3: Dice (freestyle)]
Word is born
Then I storm
With the wickedness
Come get with this
Deranged nigga with the 12-gauge
I be jacking all you niggas while I'm macking, yeah
Too many styles I have like a crab on my nuts
I scratch like maestro with cuts
But nobody knows my style so I don't give 'em no time
To learn 'em, bitches I burn 'em
With syphilis
I kill your mama and your mistress
Don't dis this
The Dice is in this bitch so don't miss this
Cause I be freestyling, wilding like a mongoose
Fuck with the rhyme I got more juice than O.J. Simpson
No glimpsin'
Bad nigga, rough nigga, rhyme nigga
Fuck around with me I'll pull my rhyme trigger
Oh shit RLPs coming down with that old school shit
James, suck my dick
Hey yo Dice is in this joint now
And it's fucked up, nobody knows about being fucked up
But when I want to get stupid I get lazy
Bitches be sucking my dick and I nut in their mouth crazy
So check it out baby I Swayze like Patrick
Fuck around with me, I'm fucking fat bitches on mattresses
Who wanna fuck with the team
Esham the Unholy, Dice and the...

[Outro: Razzaq]
Insane, gore Razzaq Rahim

As the sky turns grey
Niggas roam through the night
As the rain fall upon us
Lightning strikes like a bullet to the temple
The fog gets thicker, RAAARGH!
Mothers screams for their life or death
Breaths is tooken, by another man

At war!
We're at WAAAAARRR!
