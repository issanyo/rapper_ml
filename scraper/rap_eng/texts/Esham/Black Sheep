[VERSE 1]
Don't nobody love me
I'm from 7 M-I-L-E
Niggas from Detroit wear Adidas and Pelle
Say I remind them of the one
With "Thug Life" on his belly
The new 2Pac
Outlaw, Makaveli
I'm in a brand new DB9
See me shine
Err rapper you know be like, "That's Esham!"
Way past my prime
But there ain't no age on crime
Boomin' every second
Clockin' all the time
Dump, dump on the police
See they trying to hunt me
With a loaded .45 but I'm only 43
I ain't tell her do nothing
That's the way that shorty be
I be naughty by nature
She be naughty like me
I'm E-S-H-A-M-S-M-I-T-H
Looking like I won the hood sweepstakes
But I didn't
Still out here spittin'
That Wicketshit just in case you forgettin'
Got my murder gloves on
I'm from the Murder Mitten
One to your dome
Tell the world, "Good riddance!"
It was written in the scriptures
I was spittin' sacrilegious
Now I'm in this world a witness
These rituals of wicketness
One time for them ones who be locked down
In these streets man he can't put the Glock down
Fuck the police 'cause they can get shot down
No lives matter
Even you can catch a hot round
I support the underground
It's not just a hashtag
I'll put you six feet underground
In the trash bag
Fuck you and your money
Don't need your cash
I'm from Detroit, Beirut, Baghdad
