Yo...yeah, was something I wanted to say...oh yeah, yo

[HOOK]
All that shit that dough might get'cha
(When you die, you can't take it wit'cha)
All that shit that dough might get'cha
(So give it up, give it up, yeah)
All that shit that dough might get'cha
(When you die, you can't take it wit'cha)
All that shit that dough might get'cha
(So listen to this shit)

[VERSE 1]
Most niggas like money, cars, pussyhole
Pockets on swoll, roll Trues and Vogues
You sell your soul as the story is told
Just to hold on a bitch looking like En Vogue
So you slang 'em, gangbang 'em, nuts, hang 'em
And bitches want the money, but tricks you can't blame 'em
Got duckets, motherfuck it, so you stuck it
You either Flavor Flav it or you Chuck, Chuck, Chuck it
Got a big old house that sits on a hill
Getting high 'til you die cause that's the way you feel
But on the real, I don't give a fuck what you got
Cause it don't mean shit if your ass gets shot
Why not, most niggas plot with the Glock
And only Glocks go pop-piggity-pop-pop-pop
You just can't stop it if they're coming to get'cha
And oh yeah, you can't take it wit'cha

[HOOK]

[VERSE 2]
You might get you a house, a woman, and maybe a baby
If you don't go crazy first
And tell me what's worse
Being broke or a hearse
Huh, money is a black man's curse
But still, we got to have dollar bills
Cause if I can't see it then the shit ain't real
Where I live, Crackhead Heaven 24/7
No hope for the city of dope
It ain't no Heaven
God don't like my hood
Cause my hood is Hell and it ain't no good
Got money to the ceiling, oh what a feeling
O.G. dealing, caps get peeled and
Next, hoes want sex for some checks
Pussies getting wrecked, dicks shoved through their neck
No respect, you get no respect, so he hit 'cha
Snap your love like a picture
Ho, you can't take it wit'cha

[HOOK]

[VERSE 3]
You can't take it wit'cha
No love, no lust, no one, no gun, no cap to bust
All the things in life you've ever had
Get zipped and locked in a bodybag
What's left, life after death
You don't know
When you die you might meet the people you owe
Death Row, that's where we're all going to go
Sell your soul to the Devil
Get a tag on your toe
Oh no, no more bitches and television
Get a trip to the morgue for your final circumcision
What the fuck, you don't know what from what
'Cause they even took your dick and your nuts
Man, you can't take it wit'cha

[HOOK]
