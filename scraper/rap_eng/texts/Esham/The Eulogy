We are gathered here today
On this sorrowful occasion
To say goodbye to the dearly departed
In other words, the nigga dead
Whether or not you can survive death
That's the ultimate test for your ass, ain't it?
So far, don’t nobody we know have passed the ultimate test
Least of all this nigga laying here
'Cause this boy wasn't shit
I’m gonna tell you that right off
I saw him kicking his mama’s ass over there on 47th Street
And if you think we gonna bury you with them diamonds and shit on
You got another thing coming
I’d like to introduce the boy’s woman, hoe, bitch
I don’t know what she was
She’s laying over there in the booth
Say girl, what you doing?
Well, don’t sell no pussy in here
If you do, I want a cut
Shit, your fault the nigga dead
