[Intro]
"Assholes, bastards, fucking cunts, and pricks"

[Verse 1: Esham]
The black devils back and gotta step into the mix
The brand new rhymes and the 666
I shipwreck shit, shit gets wrecked
When I hit the set what the fuck you expect?
Don't be a motherfuckin' but a two timin' bitch
I'm not a crossover, don't plan to switch
I rob the rhythm like I was a witch
Nine dead bodies throw 'em in the ditch
You wanna try me out to come and test my style
I'll cut 'cha head off and throw it in the pile
I'm versatile, the voodoo child
Don't sweat the technique, but peep the tech style
Gettin' wicked cause I'm raisin hell
Doin' just as well to bust a brain cell
The unholy's ya man
666 and a mic in my hand

[Chorus (repeated)]
666 and a mic in my hand
666 and a mic in my hand

[Verse 2: Esham]
The U-N-H-O-L-Y flow for the track
Cut ya head off and fuck you so I know where ya heads at
I slip and I slide goin' up inside a wet one
After I bust my nut, I George Jetson
And leave no doubts
I'll put my foot up in ya ass and kick ya fuckin' pussy out
I'm not a romantic, I leave 'em panting
I'm a psychotic, lunatic, schitzophrentic
I gotta tattoo of a dick on my foot
So when I kick you in ya ass I'll be fuckin' you up too
Roll with me, roll with me
If I chopped off ya head, the police come and get me
I gotta axe for all the new jacks
When I swing I know where ya heads at

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Esham]
I'm the mister with the musical mad shit
Manic-depressant, but it's still kinda bad shit
I can get funky too
Or break me a guitar like a honkey do
But I'm no white boy
I'll slit ya throat in the middle of the night, boy
Killers don't talk but stalk the streets
I'm like a cannibal cookin' some dead meat
I'm down with R-L-P
25 preachers in a church couldn't save me
I roll like a maniac
Some say I'm insane for that, rap brainiac
Listen to the funky drummer
Or listen to the screams of the victims of Jeffrey Dahmer
Plus you don't understand
You can't kill a dead man

[Chorus]

[Repeat]
666

[Chorus]
