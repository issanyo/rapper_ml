[Chorus]
All I know, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Flip another O, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Get it fast or slow, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Better tell ya hoe, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
All I know, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Flip another O, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Get it fast or slow, get doe (keep gettin that doe)
Better tell ya hoe, get doe (keep gettin that doe)

[Esham]
All I know is chefin' up dope
Break it down and get it ready for the fiends to smoke
It's the true to be paid, nightmares your broke
You'd rather have Freddy and Jason come slit your throat
In this life we live in, cash rules everything
I'm married too my riches, fuck bitches and wedding rings
Push the peddle to the metal while your still peddling
Forever in the fast lane, never settling
Get dough, sniff blow, get some more, get a O of some dro
Blow some doe with my hoe
You might see me at the MO MO with a thick chaco
I'm a giant robot, you Johnny Socko
Stacking up my chips like Esay at King Taco
Hot like tobasco like me, but you're not though

[Chorus]
Hoes they love to lick on my balls
Drop to they knees and crawl like a dog
All I know is getting that doe
Getting that dough, getting that doe
Hoes they love to lick on my balls
Drop to they knees and crawl like a dog
All I know is getting that doe
Getting that dough, getting that doe

[Esham]
I need my skrilla, my frietos, my fetty fetty fetty
My cheddy cheddy cheddy, but y'all ain't even ready
Like Speedy Gonzey lets chase the cheese fast
Cash over ass, never in a rat trap, tote the gat for that
Pockets stay lumpy, keep the pump with me
Ain't no punkin' me, murder in company
Whip out the chrome for the block of provalone
Or the limburger, screaming murda murda murda
You, your crew, her, him, and them
All get clapped by E-S-H-A-M

[Chorus]
You might not be hungry like me
All I know when out in these streets:
G-E-T D-O-E
Pay attention motherfucker, you don't know me
You might not be hungry like me
All I know when out in these streets:
G-E-T D-O-E
Pay attention motherfucker, you don't know me
