[Verse 1]
My understanding is zero
For the simple fact I'm not a hero
Born broke, beat up, and always acting evil
I'm playing for keeps
I gots to carry my shank
Keep my hand on my thang
While I'm checking my bank
I gots nothing to lose
But I'd rather be six feet deep
I sing the blues
Cause I'm deep and I don't sleep
My understanding's zero watching channel fuzz
I don't like the fuzz
I'm like was not was
And if I was not
Then I was not or will be
You better murder me man
I'm telling y'all to kill me
The U-N-H-O-L-Y that's what they call me
My last words is like fuck all y'all G
Before I die I'll take you motherfuckers out with me
And when I die the meat-wagon's gonna come and get me
My understanding's zero cause I'm just a zero
I hear no, I say no, I see no, no evil (Yo!)
Is I crazy, is I am, is I am?
My butcher knife's bloody so fuck the flim flam
And 'bout your God, 'bout your God, your God is money man
In God We Trust
The ill rhyme I bust (Oh!)
I fall into a state of ill depression
Playing me a game of true confessions
I want y'all to know, I want y'all to know
If you grow up in the ghetto
Your understanding's zero
(Fades away)
