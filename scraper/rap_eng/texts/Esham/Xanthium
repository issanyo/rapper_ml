[Intro]
I have a rendezvous with Death
(What?)
At some disputed barricade
(What? Me?)
May be he shall take my hand
And lead me into his dark land
And close my eyes and quench my breath
I have a rendezvous with Death

[Verse 1]
I got a date with death I can't be late
She told me to pick her up at bout 8
If looks could kill then I'd be dead
I need her like I need a fuckin whole in my head
I got a date with death she wanna take me out
Vampire police stake me out
Peruvian fish scale flake me out
Thought I was gone live but she faked me out

[Hook]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces

Death is at my door
And I know what she knocking for
I got that dope she tryna score
I give her some she want some more
She want some more...

[Verse 2]
Death comes in 2s and 3s
I'm from Detroit it comes with ease
On every street and every block
Death be up in every spot
Death by day, death by night
Dath be running thru the light
Death be crashing into you
And it wasn't accidental
